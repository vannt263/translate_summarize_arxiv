    "protein folding studies @xcite pose a great challenge to microfluidic mixers .",
    "proteins are composed of chains of amino acids which take on complex three - dimensional ( 3d ) structures to achieve a wide range of biological functions @xcite .",
    "the range of applications of protein folding in research and industry is wide and includes drug discovery , dna sequencing , and molecular analysis or food engineering @xcite .",
    "one of the most versatile methods of initiating the process of protein folding is using changes in chemical potential ( e.g. , changing the concentration of a chemical species ) @xcite .    in this work , we consider a class of microfluidic mixers based on diffusion from ( or to ) a hydrodynamically focused stream .",
    "this type of mixer was initially proposed by brody et al .  .",
    "a geometrical representation of such a mixer is shown in figure  [ curgeoa ] ( here our optimized mixer of ref . ) .",
    "the basic features of the design are as follows : it is composed of three inlet channels and a common outlet channel , and the geometry has a symmetry with the center channel .",
    "typically , a mixture of unfolded proteins and a chemical denaturant solution is injected through the center channel and exposed to background buffers ( no denaturant ) streams through the two side channels .",
    "the design goal is to rapidly decrease the denaturant concentration in order to rapidly initiate protein folding in the outlet channel @xcite . since the publication of brody et al .",
    ", there have been significant advances on the design of these mixers @xcite including reduction in consumption rate of reactants , methods of detection , manufacturing and , perhaps most importantly , drastic reductions of the mixing time ( i.e. the time required to reach a sufficiently low denaturant concentration ) .",
    "we recently studied the optimization of the shape and flow conditions of a particular hydrodynamic focused microfluidic mixer@xcite .",
    "the objective was to improve the mixing time of the best mixer designs found in literature , which exhibited mixing times of approximately 1.0 @xmath0s .",
    "to this end , we introduced a mathematical model which computes the mixing time for a given mixer geometry and injection velocities .",
    "then , we defined the corresponding optimization problem and solved it by considering a hybrid global optimization method @xcite . this approach was carried out and presented using both 2d and 3d models . to save on computational time ,",
    "much of the optimization process was conducted using the 2d model . however , our earlier work also pointed out that certain important effects ( including the impact of upper and lower mixer walls and inertial effects on the velocity field ) can be appreciated only with the 3d model .",
    "we therefore performed 3d model studies to analyze such effects .",
    "the optimized mixer generated by our approach achieved a mixing time of about 0.10 @xmath0s .",
    "the shape of this optimized microfluidic mixer , its concentration distribution and the concentration evolution of a particle in its central streamline are summarized in figure  [ res2d ] .",
    "the optimized side and center channel injection velocities were @xmath15.2 m s@xmath2 and @xmath30.2 m s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the optimization problem studied in this previous work was identified as highly nonlinear@xcite .",
    "further , the process has many parameters which are difficult to know with great precision in experiments .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand and quantify the stability of the device performance with respect to these parameters",
    ". this enables identification of key parameters and so guide experimental efforts . to this aim , we have analyzed the optimized mixer to study and quantify its robustness to parameters perturbations .",
    "we previously presented a very simple sensitivity analysis  @xcite . that preliminary sensitivity study consisted of random perturbations of all the parameters by taking uniform variations within a range of of their value .",
    "results showed that the mixing time variations were of the same order as the normalized perturbations considered , suggesting the optimized solution was fairly stable .",
    "see ivorra et al  @xcite for further information .    here , we significantly increase the scope of our sensitivity analysis .",
    "we quantify the impact of mixing time on the key design parameters of the mixer .",
    "the objective of our study is to provide recommendations and guidelines for the fabrication of the device introduced here .",
    "more precisely , we consider and study ( i ) geometrical parameters defining the mixer shape : the angle defined by the channel intersection , the shape of the channel intersection , the width of the inlet and outlet channels , the mixer depth and possible irregularities in the symmetry of the shape;(ii ) central and side injections velocities ; and ( iii ) physical coefficients associated with the working fluid and the concentration thresholds of the mixing time definition .",
    "in addition to those sensitivity analysis experiments , we also analyze the uniformity of the mixing time as a function of the inlet streamline location in the inlet channel .",
    "this mixing time uniformity analysis quantifies the robustness of the mixing time through the whole inlet flow , and helps place a statistical confidence on observed mixing times .",
    "in particular , it helps quantify the so - called wall effect ( due to the no - slip condition at the mixer walls , resulting in low velocity values near the walls ) on mixer performance .",
    "the last two decades have seen a large number of microfluidic device designs and their use in a wide range of applications .",
    "most , if not all , of these devices have performance specifications which are dependent on their geometry and flow control conditions ( e.g. , flow rates , pressure , inlet concentrations ) . despite this",
    ", the systematic study of how performance depends on intentional or untintential design parameters is rarely if ever demonstrated .",
    "for this reason , we also offer the current work as a case study describing the significant challenge and complexity of determining design robustness for microfluidics .",
    "this article is organized as follows : section [ model ] introduces the 3d model used to estimate the mixing times . section [ uniform ] describes the mixing time uniformity analysis and the results .",
    "section [ sensa ] presents the numerical experiments carried out to perform the extended sensitivity analysis and deduce major conclusions and design guidelines .",
    "we consider the microfluidic mixer described in section [ intro ] .",
    "the geometry has two symmetry planes which we use to reduce the simulation domain to a quarter of the mixer .",
    "this reduced domain is denoted by @xmath4 , as depicted in figure [ curgeoa ] .",
    "the mixer shape is composed of interpolated surfaces , and the inlet velocities are described by a set of parameters denoted by @xmath5 , detailed in ref . .",
    "we consider guanidine hydrochloride ( gdcl ) as the denaturant @xcite .",
    "we assume the mixer liquid flow is incompressible @xcite .",
    "thus , the flow velocity and the denaturant concentration distribution are approximated by using the steady configurations of the incompressible navier - stokes equations coupled with the convective diffusion equation .",
    "more precisely , we consider the following system @xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the denaturant normalized concentration distribution , @xmath8 is the flow velocity vector ( m s@xmath2 ) , @xmath9 is the pressure field ( pa ) , @xmath10 is the diffusion coefficient of the denaturant solution in the background buffer ( m@xmath11 s@xmath2 ) , @xmath12 is the denaturant solution dynamic viscosity ( kg m@xmath2 s@xmath2 ) and @xmath13 is the denaturant solution density ( kg m@xmath14 ) .    system ( [ eql1 ] ) is completed by the following boundary conditions :    for the flow velocity @xmath8 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the boundaries representing the central inlet , the side inlet , the outlet , the mixer walls and the symmetry plane , respectively ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the maximum side and center channel injection velocities ( m s@xmath2 ) , respectively ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the laminar flow profiles , which are equal to 0 in the inlet border and to 1 in the inlet center , of the side and central inlets , respectively @xcite ; and @xmath25 is the local orthonormal reference frame along the boundary .    for the concentration @xmath7 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the initial denaturant normalized concentration in the center inlet .",
    "in this work , the mixing time of a particular mixer @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath28 is defined as the time required to change the denaturant normalized concentration of a typical lagrangian stream fluid particle situated in the symmetry streamline at depth @xmath29 @xmath0 m from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "it is computed by :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the solution of system ( [ eql1])- , when considering the mixer defined by @xmath5 ; and @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the y - coordinate of points situated along the streamline defined by the intersection of the two symmetry planes @xmath29 @xmath0 m and @xmath37 @xmath0 m , i.e. the y - axis , where the denaturant normalized concentration @xmath34 is @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . by default , we assume @xmath40% and @xmath41",
    ".    the numerical model used to approximate the solutions of system ( [ eql1])-([boundcc ] ) and to compute ( [ mtcf ] ) was implemented by coupling matlab scripts with comsol multiphysics 3.5a models .",
    "we first analyze the non - uniformity of mixing times across the focused stream for our optimized mixer @xmath42 . indeed , as suggested in refs .",
    ", the mixing time can be measured not only in the symmetry streamline , situated on the ( x , z)=(0,0 ) segment , but also in other streamlines .",
    "we are interested in the uniformity of mixing times , as protein states in these mixers are quantified experimentally within a finite probe volume which integrates signal throughout a volume in space within the mixing region .",
    "this measurement volume is fed in principle by all streamlines of the center inlet channel .",
    "we consider 100 streamlines , denoted by @xmath43 , starting from a finite set of points , which are denoted by @xmath44 , in @xmath16 .",
    "here , @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47m@xmath48m@xmath49 . in the previous definition ,",
    "the maximum coordinate in the x - axis ( i.e. , 0.9 @xmath0 m ) has been selected in order to avoid particles too close to the wall @xmath19 , and the maximum coordinate in the z - axis ( i.e. , 0.75 @xmath0 m ) has been chosen as a characteristic 1.5 @xmath0 m depth of field for confocal microscope imaging ( i.e. , extent of the measurement volume)@xcite .",
    "those streamlines are numerically approximated by considering an explicit euler scheme and the velocity vector @xmath8 obtained by solving system - @xcite .",
    "for each streamline @xmath50 , we compute the associated mixing times , denoted by @xmath51 , in a manner similar to equation .",
    "more precisely , @xmath51 is defined as the time required by a protein within a lagrangian fluid particle to travel from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the points within @xmath50 with a concentration of @xmath54% and @xmath55% , respectively .",
    "next , we study the spatial distribution according to the streamline starting point in @xmath44 , the maximum value , the mean value and the standard deviation of @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , we also compute the weighted mixing time value of @xmath50 , denoted by @xmath57 and defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the velocity of a particle in the streamline @xmath50 at its initial position @xmath60 .",
    "this choice of weight coefficients reflects the fact that the probe volume used to measure experimentally the mixing time receive particles more frequently from streamlines with the highest velocities .",
    "the maximum and standard deviation values of those weighted mixing times @xmath61 are also studied .",
    "furthermore , due to the fact that the depth of the mixer is 10 times larger than the minimum width of the center channel , the mixing time variations in the z - axis direction are negligible in comparison to the variations in the x - axis @xcite .",
    "thus , we perform a more extensive uniformity analysis along the x - axis , by considering 100 streamlines , denoted by @xmath62 , in the plane @xmath29 starting from the set of points @xmath63m@xmath64m@xmath49 in @xmath16 .",
    "the methodology is the same as that introduced previously . in this case",
    ", we also compute the evolution of both the mean value and standard deviation of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "these results will be compared with the ones presented in ref . .",
    "our study of mixing time uniformity yielded that the mean mixing time value obtained by considering @xmath68 was 0.34 @xmath0s with a standard deviation of 0.17 @xmath0s . as expected ,",
    "the maximum mixing time value was reached at the streamline @xmath69 with a value of 1.43 @xmath0s .",
    "the mixing times @xmath51 and weighted mixing times @xmath57 of the considered streamlines @xmath43 are presented in figure [ uan]-(a ) . as shown , within 0.4 @xmath0 m of the centerline",
    ", the mixing times vary between 0.1 @xmath0s and 0.5 @xmath0s , and this region accounts for 60% of the detection events ( i.e. , considering the sum of the weight coefficients @xmath70 ) .",
    "in contrast , the near - wall region of [ 0.7 , 0.9 ] @xmath0 m of the centerline have mixing times between 1 and 1.43 @xmath0s , but these streamlines contribute to only 10% of detection events ( i.e. , considering @xmath71 ) .     in @xmath72 of the initial particle for the considered streamlines , * b ) * mixing and weighted mixing times obtained as a function of the position @xmath73 in @xmath72 of the initial particle and for the streamlines considered in the plane @xmath29 .",
    "the weighted mixing time reflects the frequency of events ( measurements of proteins along said streamline ) as determined by the stream - line averaged velocity .",
    "the lower velocities near the wall yield longer mixing times but are less frequent.,title=\"fig:\",width=415 ] +   in @xmath72 of the initial particle for the considered streamlines , * b ) * mixing and weighted mixing times obtained as a function of the position @xmath73 in @xmath72 of the initial particle and for the streamlines considered in the plane @xmath29 .",
    "the weighted mixing time reflects the frequency of events ( measurements of proteins along said streamline ) as determined by the stream - line averaged velocity .",
    "the lower velocities near the wall yield longer mixing times but are less frequent.,title=\"fig:\",width=415 ]    next , the mixing times @xmath74 and weighted mixing times @xmath75 across the streamlines @xmath62 are plotted versus spanwise streamline position in figure [ uan]-(b ) . for these 100 streamlines , the mean mixing time computed by considering @xmath76 was 0.32 @xmath0s with a standard deviation of 0.16 @xmath0s .",
    "again , we can observe that particles near the walls exhibit higher mixing times ( @xmath771 @xmath0s ) .",
    "however , these near - wall - slow - moving particles contribute only infrequently to probe volume detection events .    we note similar phenomena",
    "were reported in ref . .",
    "however , the mixer presented in that work exhibited a mean mixing time , considering streamlines in the plane z=0 , of 3.1 @xmath0s with a standard deviation of 1.5 @xmath0s .",
    "the maximum mixing time value was 10 @xmath0s , obtained for the streamline closer to the wall @xmath19 .",
    "the optimized mixer design presented here therefore offers better mixing time uniformity leading to more consistent measurements and less scatter in measurement ensembles .",
    "we here present a study of the influence of key parameters of the model described in section [ model ] on mixer mixing time .",
    "we vary parameters individually , fixing the values of others to the corresponding value of the optimized mixer @xmath42 .",
    "we note that , in our previous work , we explored the impact of simultaneous perturbations on the whole set of parameters on mixer performance@xcite .",
    "we here perform the more complete influence of individual perturbations on the mixing time .",
    "we believe such individual parameter perturbation analyses are also more useful to designers in identifying key parameters and methods for fabrication .",
    "we consider the following percent variation function : @xmath78 where @xmath79 represents the perturbed mixer .",
    "the parameters analyzed can be classified in three categories : ( i ) geometrical parameters defining the mixer shape ; ( ii ) central and side injections velocities ; and ( iii ) physical coefficients associated with the denaturant solution and the concentration threshold in the mixing time definition .      in the following computational experiments ,",
    "we analyze the variation on the mixing time due to changes in : ( i ) the angle defined at the channel intersection ; ( ii ) the shape of the channel intersection ; ( iii ) the width of the inlet and outlet channels ; ( iv ) the mixer depth ; and ( v ) perturbation in the symmetry of the mixer shape .",
    "first , we study the angle between the x - axis and the mixer side channel , denoted by @xmath80 .",
    "the optimized value @xmath81 is varied from 0 up to @xmath82 by considering 50 equally spaced intermediate values ( i.e , we perform 50 evaluations of our model ) .",
    "a geometrical representation of those variations is showed in figure  [ angf ] .",
    "perturbations on @xmath80 have generated a mean variation in the mixing time of 3% .",
    "figure  [ angr ] gives a graphical representation of the obtained results .",
    "as we can observe on this plot , the maximum variation was around 15% and was obtained for @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , the variation was less than 4% for angles lower than @xmath84 , and grew up exponentially after that value .",
    "this suggests that the angle is not a sensible parameter for the mixer performance .",
    "we now study the impact of the shape of the area where the three inlets and the outlet intersect .",
    "the shapes allowed by our model are built by considering beziers curves and describe a bubble ( also called protuberance ) invading the central and side inlets from the upper corner ( according to y - axis ) and a protuberance invading the outlet and side inlets from the lower corner .",
    "these protuberances are defined according to a restriction ( due to a convenient lithographic and plasma etching limitation ) of a minimum channel width of 1@xmath0 m . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "those bubbles are only described by two scalar numbers prot@xmath85 and prot@xmath86 in @xmath87 $ ] , where 0 corresponds to the minimum bubble shape and unity is the maximum bubble shape of the upper and lower corner , respectively , as allowed by the model .",
    "the optimal shape corresponds to prot@xmath85=0.8 and prot@xmath86=0.7 .",
    "the parts of the mixer shape corresponding to prot@xmath85 and prot@xmath86 are presented in figure [ res2d ] .",
    "a geometrical representation of the minimum , maximum and optimal shapes of the protuberances is given in figure [ cornf ] .",
    "this experiment consisted of computing the mixing time of the mixer generated by considering all the possible combination of values of prot@xmath85 and prot@xmath86 in @xmath87 $ ] with a grid step size of 0.1 .",
    "this required 121 evaluations of our model .",
    "the variation of the mixing time according to analyzed values of prot@xmath85 and prot@xmath86 is presented in figure [ cornr ] and values are reported in table [ tcornr ] . as shown by both the figure and the table , for values of prot@xmath85 and prot@xmath86 lower than 0.5 ,",
    "the mixing time dramatically increased from 50% up to 250% .",
    "this indicates that a minimum protuberance in both upper and lower corners should be considered in order to obtain an efficient mixing time .",
    "furthermore , when prot@xmath85 and prot@xmath86 were greater than 0.5 , the variation in mixing time was moderated and was lowered by 22% , which can be considered as a reasonable value .",
    "in addition to those first results , we see that the impact on the mixing of prot@xmath85 was greater than prot@xmath86 . for instance , by decreasing the parameter prot@xmath86 from 1 to 0 and fixing the value of prot@xmath85=1 , we have generated mixing time variations up to 50% , whereas by decreasing the parameter prot@xmath85 and fixing prot@xmath86=1 we have obtained a maximum 20% variation of mixing time .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that the length of the lower corner is much larger than that of the upper ( see figure [ cornf ] ) , thus , its influence on the mixing time is expected to be greater .",
    ".percentage variation in mixing time of the optimal design value and considering the protuberances described in section [ shape ] .",
    "here protuberances parameters prot@xmath85 and prot@xmath86 , each vary from 0 to unity with a grid step size of 0.1 .",
    "the optimal shape ( - ) is obtained with prot@xmath85=0.8 and prot@xmath86=0.7 .",
    "[ tcornr ] [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we conclude that accurate control of flow rates is crucial to achieving fast mixing .",
    "we recommend that flow rates be analyzed by experimental quantitation of inlet velocities using , for example , micron - resolution particle image velocimetry ( as performed by hertzog et al . in ref .",
    "we next studied the stability of the mixing time of the optimized mixer to changes in the thermophysical coefficients of the denaturant solution or in the concentration values needed to control the folding process . in physical experiments , these changes may result from uncertainties in conditions or solution properties ( temperature , pressure , dilution , etc.)@xcite the following sections summarize .",
    "we chose for our work guanidine hydrochloride ( gdcl ) as a typical denaturant @xcite described by the following parameters : diffusivity in background buffer of @xmath10 m@xmath11 s@xmath2 , denaturant solution dynamic viscosity of @xmath12 kg m@xmath2 s@xmath2 and mass density of @xmath13 kg m@xmath14 .",
    "the thermophysical properties of gdcl solutions vary with concentration and ambient temperature : consistent with the experimental work of refs . , and , ( i ) the density of the gdcl solutions can vary within [ 1000,1700 ] kg m@xmath14 ; ( ii ) its viscosity can vary in [ 4,11]@xmath88 kg m@xmath2 s@xmath2 ; and ( iii ) its diffusivity can vary in [ 1.9,13]@xmath89 m@xmath11 s@xmath2 .",
    "we considered the impact of these parameter variations on mixing time .",
    "we varied each parameter within the aforementioned intervals using seven equispaced values .",
    "all possible configurations of parameters values were studied , which represents a total of 343 evaluations of the model .",
    "then , similar to the work presented in section [ widthe ] , we computed the mean evolution of mixing time for each parameter value format both its lower and upper bound , and while varying the remaining coefficients to all their possible values .",
    "the variations of the mean mixing time of the diffusion , density and viscosity are presented in figure [ coefr ] .",
    "we see that the diffusion was the most sensitive parameter , and can increase mixing time by up to 0.3@xmath0s .",
    "the other two coefficients maintained the mean mixing time close to 0.1@xmath0s .",
    "we note all of these values reasonable for the design as the order of mixing time is preserved .",
    "we further note increasing viscosity and decreasing diffusivity and density result in lower mixing time .",
    "the effect of decreasing diffusivity may at first seem counterintuitive , but mixing time is the result of a geometry- and flow - rate - dependent convective diffusion process .",
    "for example , high diffusivity can result in significant decreases of denaturant concentration within the early - focusing region of the center jet , where fluid velocities are still too low to stretch material interfaces and decrease diffusion lengths of the center jet .",
    "the latter effect is discussed by hertzog et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( e.g. , see figure 2 of that reference ) .",
    "finally , we characterize the sensitivity of the mixer to the maximum and minimum denaturant concentration values of our mixing time ( see ( 4 ) ) .",
    "the original mixer was designed to trigger unfolding for a concentration reduction of 60% .",
    "we here consider mixing times for denaturant concentration reductions ranging from 10% and 92% . to this end , for a particular threshold value denoted by @xmath90 , we identify @xmath91 and @xmath92 such that @xmath93 and they produce the minimum mixing time value @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 denote the y - coordinates of the points situated along the streamline defined by the intersection of the two symmetry planes @xmath29 @xmath0 m and @xmath37 @xmath0 m , i.e. the y - axis , where the denaturant normalized concentration is @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "results are presented in figure [ concr ] .",
    "the mixer exhibited mixing times lower than 0.4@xmath0s for up to a reduction of 90% .",
    "we conclude that it is a robust design as the maximum reduction allowed by the flow rate ratios in this mixer was 92% . for a 70% denaturant concentration reduction",
    ", we observed a 0.1@xmath0s mixing time .",
    "the latter can be compared to the mixer of ref . which showed mixing times of 1@xmath0s for the same denaturant concentration reduction@xcite .",
    "we presented a detailed study of the robustness and performance of a microfluidic mixer design first presented in ref . .",
    "the mixer is for protein folding dynamics studies and can be used to initiate the folding process of a protein by diluting a local denaturant concentration in a short time interval . in ref . , we used a 3d numerical model and showed the ideal mixer shape , flow control parameters , and expected thermophysical parameters , which resulted in a mixing time of 0.10 @xmath0s .",
    "we here studied the robustness of this mixer relative to expected variations of these major design features .",
    "in particular , we studied ( i ) the uniformity of the mixing time through the center inlet flow and ( ii ) the sensitivity of the mixing time with respect to key mixer parameters . the uniformity study showed that mixing time is quite stable throughout the majority of the inlet stream ( up to a distance from the walls of 0.4 @xmath0 m ) . with respect to design robustness",
    ", we found that the details of the mixer design in the region near the channel intersections are essential to the performance , i.e. , the shape the minimum channel widths near this inlet , the inlet flow velocity ratio , and possible ( unwanted ) asymmetries in the fabrication .",
    "other factors such as inlet channel angles , mixer depth ( above a certain minimum ) , fluid properties , and denaturant concentration thresholds for protein folding have significantly weaker effect on mixing time",
    ".    our analyses may provide a guide to designers and fabricators of protein folding mixer devices , and can be used to evaluate trade - offs between manufacturing quality , precision of flow control , and expected performance .",
    "our work also serves as a case study associated with the general design and performance prediction of microfluidic devices , and may serve as a guide to designing complex and optimal fluidic systems . in the least",

    "<S> we consider a microfluidic mixer based on hydrodynamic focusing , which is used to initiate the folding process of individual proteins . </S>",
    "<S> the folding process is initiated by quickly diluting a local denaturant concentration , and we define mixing time as the time advecting proteins experience a specified to achieve a local drop in denaturant concentration . in previous work , we presented a minimization of mixing time which considered optimal geometry and flow conditions , and achieved a design with a predicted mixing time of 0.10 @xmath0s . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the current paper is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> first , we explore the sensitivity of mixing time to key geometric and flow parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the angle between inlets , the shape of the channel intersections , channel widths , mixer depth , mixer symmetry , inlet velocities , working fluid physical properties , and denaturant concentration thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> second , we analyze the uniformity of mixing times as a function of inlet flow streamlines . </S>",
    "<S> we find the shape of the intersection , channel width , inlet velocity ratio , and asymmetries have strong effects on mixing time ; while inlet angles , mixer depth , fluid properties , and concentration thresholds have weaker effects . </S>",
    "<S> also , the uniformity of the mixing time is preserved for most of the inlet flow and distances of down to within about 0.4 @xmath0 m of the mixer wall . </S>",
    "<S> we offer these analyses of sensitivities to imperfections in mixer geometry and flow conditions as a guide to experimental efforts which aim to fabricate and use these types of mixers . </S>",
    "<S> our study also highlights key issues and provides a guide to the optimization and practical design of other microfluidic devices dependent on both geometry and flow conditions . </S>"
