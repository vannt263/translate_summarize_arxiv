    "* this part of the paper will be published online and it has a separate bibliography *      the first step in modeling this problem is to reconstruct the conditions under which mgg-11 was born 712myr ago .",
    "mccrady et al@xcite determine the cluster age and mass - to - light ratio , and from these conclude that the mass function is consistent with a power - law having the salpeter@xcite slope and a lower mass limit of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "at the current age of the cluster , all stars more massive than @xmath271725@xcite have experienced supernovae .",
    "we adopt this mass function in most of our simulations , with an upper limit of 100 .",
    "this choice of mass limit is motivated by the fact that there are several clusters in the milky way galaxy with characteristics similar to the two clusters studied here ( mgg-11 and mgg-9 ) that are young enough for the highest - mass stars still to be present .",
    "these clusters are the arches@xcite , quintuplet@xcite , ngc3603@xcite and the central cluster r136@xcite in the 30 doradus region in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the publications cited here support the existence of stars of @xmath34 in these clusters .",
    "in addition , an upper mass limit of @xmath35 in the galactic disc is probably quite realistic @xcite .",
    "the 1 lower mass cut - off for the initial mass function ( imf ) is somewhat controversial .",
    "however , the mass functions in several of the young star clusters in the antennae galaxies@xcite , the arches cluster@xcite , quintuplet cluster@xcite , ngc1705 - 1@xcite and the star cluster mgg - f in m82@xcite are consistent with a similar lower mass cut - off . for our study",
    "we adopt the observed mass function as a first choice , but in later runs we vary the mass function to test the effect of changing it .    at zero age the mean mass of our adopted imf is @xmath36 . at the observed age of 712myr",
    "the mean stellar mass has dropped to @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "what actually happens to stars of @xmath271725 which experience a supernova before 712myr is not crucial for this estimate , as there are only 15002500 such stars .",
    "if we naively assume that all the mass in these stars is simply lost from the cluster we obtain mean stellar mass of 2.52.6 .",
    "if we assume that stars more massive than 25 turn into 10 black holes and stars of lower mass into chandrasekhar [ 1.4 ] mass neutron stars , the mean stellar mass drops to @xmath38 . with today s measured mass of @xmath39@xcite",
    "the cluster then contains @xmath40140,000 stars , implying an initial total mass of @xmath41@xmath42 .    in order to model the cluster",
    "we must know its initial half - mass radius @xmath7 .",
    "we obtain this parameter by de - projecting the observed half - light radius and correcting for the expansion of the cluster during its lifetime .",
    "the two corrections are comparable , but with opposite sign : the half - mass radius is @xmath2725 percent larger than the observed half - light radius , and mass loss due to stellar evolution drives adiabatic expansion of the cluster radius by @xmath2720 percent .",
    "the initial half - mass radius of mgg-11 is then @xmath43pc .",
    "here we assume that mass follows light after 12 myr , i.e.  that the light profile is not significantly affected by the segregation of the most massive stars .",
    "this turns out to be a reasonable assumption .",
    "note that the mass - to - light ratio for mgg-11 reported by mccrady et al .",
    "is @xmath44 , and that adding a 3000 non - luminous object to the cluster increases this value only by about 1 percent . a similar analysis for mgg-9 results in a total mass at birth of @xmath45 and an initial half - mass radius of @xmath46pc .",
    "we ignore the effect of the tidal field of m82 in our simulations .",
    "the runaway growth studied for these clusters takes place within the dynamical friction time scale of the most massive stars and the process discussed here takes place deep within the cluster core . even though the cluster may lose a few stars to its host galaxy",
    ", this does not affect the processes driving the collision runaway .",
    "note that the two clusters mgg-9 and mgg-11 are close together on the sky , and could in principle be bound in a binary cluster . at the 3.9mpc@xcite distance of m82 ,",
    "the projected distance between mgg-9 and mgg-11 is about 30pc .",
    "we note that in the lmc there are a few hundred binary clusters for which the projected separation is smaller than 20 pc @xcite .",
    "our simulations were performed using two independently developed @xmath11-body packages , starlab@xcite and nbody4 @xcite .",
    "both codes achieve their highest speed when running on the grape-6 special - purpose hardware @xcite .",
    "a comparison between starlab and nbody4 is presented by heggie ( 2001)@xcite . both codes incorporate parametrized stellar evolution and allow for the possibility of direct physical collisions between stars , thus including the two key physical elements in our runaway scenario .",
    "the criteria for stellar collisions in both codes are quite similar ; a collision occurs if the distance between two stars becomes smaller than the sum of the stellar radii . during a collision mass and momentum are conserved .",
    "these are reasonable assumptions since the relative velocity of any two colliding stars is typically much smaller than the escape speed from either stellar surface @xcite . as the runaway star grows in mass its angular momentum increases due to off - axis collisions .",
    "our stellar evolution prescriptions did not incorporate special treatments to account for this effect . rapidly rotating stars tend to develop significant horizontal turbulence which may dramatically affect the further evolution of the star .",
    "calculations for a rapidly rotating star of 120 results in a @xmath47 percent extension of the lifetime compared with a non - rotating star .",
    "this effect is stronger for lower mass stars , but has not yet been explored for more massive stars .    the collision radius of a star is taken to be identical to the stellar size , except for black holes for which we use the tidal radius , which is considerably larger than the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the zero - age radii of various stellar evolution models are presented in figure [ fig : mr ] .",
    "the radii in starlab are systematically smaller than those in nbody4 .",
    "the collision cross sections in the appropriate range of initial conditions are dominated by gravitational focusing , and therefore the stellar size propagates linearly in the collision rate , and consequently also in the final mass of the runaway star .",
    "we simulated mgg-11 and mgg-9 using initial mass functions and half mass radii based on the observations of mccrady et al.@xcite most of these calculations were performed with 131072 ( 128k ) stars .",
    "the initial density distribution is poorly constrained by the observations and we therefore performed a series of simulations with various choices for the initial density profile , ranging from the very shallow @xmath48 ( equivalent to @xmath49 ) to highly concentrated @xmath50 ( equivalent to @xmath51 ) . to further test our theoretical understanding that a collision runaway",
    "is prevented by the first supernova explosions for @xmath52myr we systematically increased the initial @xmath6 for two selected values of @xmath15 in our mgg-11 simulations ( by varying the initial half - mass radius @xmath7 ) , until the collision runaway was prevented .",
    "the results are presented in figure 3 of the main text .",
    "note that we plot the horizontal error bars for both clusters near the top of the figure for practical reasons ; these should not be interpreted as upper limits on the concentration parameter .    in order to illustrate the early core collapse in the more concentrated models , and the absence thereof in the shallower models , figure [ fig : rcore ] plots the evolution of the core radius for a selected number of simulations for mgg-11 .",
    "we discuss each curve in turn , starting at the top .",
    "the core radius of the shallow model , @xmath53 ( @xmath49 ) , hardly changes with time .",
    "the intermediate model @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) almost experiences core collapse near @xmath56myr but as stellar mass loss starts to drive the expansion of the core it never really experiences collapse .",
    "inspection of figure 3 of the main text shows that neither of these clusters experienced a collision runaway .",
    "core collapse occurs in the @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) model near @xmath59myr , which also corresponds to the time of the first collision .",
    "the @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) simulation is so concentrated that it starts virtually in core collapse , and the entire cluster evolution is dominated by a post - collapse phase .",
    "inspection of figure 2 in the main text reveals that in these calculations the runaway also tends to start earlier .",
    "the larger fluctuations in the core radius for models @xmath58 and @xmath61 compared to the less concentrated models reflect the orbit of the runaway star around the density center of the star cluster .",
    "the runaway star is always found in the core , but occasionally at a substantial distance from the center .",
    "we performed four simulations for mgg-11 adopting @xmath58 with different initial mass functions in order to study the effect of the mass function on the calculations .",
    "reducing the upper limit on the imf from 100 to 50 reduces the mass of the runaway star at the moment of the supernova explosion by about 20 percent .",
    "simulations with the kroupa ( 2001)@xcite imf and a lower mass limit of 0.1 , as well as one run with a salpeter imf and a lower mass limit of 0.2 , resulted in a @xmath62% lower runaway mass .",
    "these latter simulations were run with 585,000 stars .",
    "the lower mass of the runaway star in the simulations with the reduced upper mass limit is a direct consequence of the smaller number of massive stars in the simulation , causing the average mass of the collision counterparts to be smaller and the collision rate to be lower .",
    "we also performed a calculation using the initial conditions for mgg-11 but with the zero - age stellar radii published by ishii et al.(1999)@xcite for the collision runaway .",
    "this calculation resulted in the a similar black hole mass as in the nbody4 calculations with otherwise the same initial conditions .",
    "in addition , we performed several simulations for mgg-9 , which is well outside the regime where a collision runaway can occur ( see figure 3 of the main text ) .",
    "for mgg-9 the imf is consistent with a salpeter imf with a lower mass limit of 0.2 , and also with the kroupa imf .",
    "however , due to computational limitations we could only perform simulations with the 1 cut - off imf for mgg-9 .",
    "simulations with the kroupa imf would require 3.6 million stars , which is beyond our current capabilities . in the case of the salpeter imf with a lower limit of 1 , and with other parameters chosen consistent with the observations of mccrady",
    "et al for mgg-9 , we did not observe runaway merging .    finally , we performed two calculations for mgg-11 using @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , and including 10 percent primordial binaries .",
    "the current binary fractions for mgg-11 is not determined by the observations , but based on studies of other clusters , 10 percent seems a reasonable choice @xcite .",
    "we select initial orbital separations ranging from roche - lobe contact ( at a binding energy of about 300kt ) to that corresponding to a binding energy of @xmath63kt , which is near the dividing line between hard and soft binaries @xcite .",
    "( note that the total kinetic energy of the stellar system is @xmath64 . )",
    "the other initial binary parameters were selected as in portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) @xcite .",
    "though modest , this fraction should be sufficient to completely dominate the dynamical evolution of the cluster core @xcite .",
    "the presence of primordial binaries in our models causes an increase in the overall merger rate by about a factor of four .",
    "most of these mergers do not involve the runaway star but occur as a result of unstable mass transfer in a primordial binary .",
    "the collision rate with the runaway star increases by about 30 percent , and as a consequence the mass of the runaway star at the time of supernova is 2236 percent larger than without primordial binaries .",
    "we have neglected the possibility of primordial mass segregation , which would further favor the runaway process , as massive stars would be born preferentially in the cluster core .",

    "<S> less massive stars undergo weaker dynamical friction , and thus must start at smaller radii in order to reach the cluster center on a similar time scale .    for mgg-11 , we find @xmath13myr , which is comparable to the main - sequence lifetimes of the most massive stars . on the other hand , for mgg-9 , </S>",

    "<S> given the high central density of mgg-11 , its massive stars , once accumulated in the cluster center , can not avoid a runaway collision @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have tested this scenario by carrying out star - by - star simulations of mgg-11 and mgg-9 using two independently developed @xmath11-body codes , starlab@xcite and nbody4 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we find that , for @xmath17 ( which for `` king''@xcite models is equivalent to a dimensionless central potential @xmath18 ) our mgg-11 models do indeed show runaway growth via repeated collisions . </S>",

    "<S> , we assume that stars having masses @xmath19 collapse to black holes without significant mass loss in supernova explosions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our stellar evolution models for stars with masses between 50 and 1000 are based on detailed calculations for such high - mass stars @xcite .    the quantitative differences evident in figure [ fig : mbh ] between the simulations performed with starlab and those using nbody4 are due mainly to the different radii assumed for the runaway star in those two packages . stars of masses @xmath20 in nbody4 are larger ( in a time - averaged sense ) by about a factor of 3 compared to those in starlab . </S>",
    "<S> ( more details are provided in _ </S>",
    "<S> supplementary information_. ) because gravitational focusing dominates the collision cross section , this difference propagates linearly in the collision rate , explaining the factor @xmath21 difference in the final mass of the runaway star . </S>",
    "<S> apart from this effect , we find that our qualitative results are quite insensitive to the details of the adopted evolution prescription .    for mgg-11 , </S>",
    "<S> the runaway star typically experienced a total of @xmath22100 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> most of them occurred during the first 3 myr , that is , before the star became a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the collision counterparts are usually 3050 main - sequence stars . </S>",
    "<S> by the time the runaway star collapsed to a black hole it had reached a mass of 8003000 . </S>",
    "<S> later the black hole may capture a companion star to become an ultraluminous x - ray source @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> no episode of runaway growth was seen in our mgg-11 models with @xmath23 , nor in any of the mgg-9 simulations , regardless of initial concentration . </S>",
    "<S> thus we see very clearly that differences in bulk parameters , specifically the dynamical friction time scale for the most massive stars , can readily explain why mgg-11 might host an imbh while mgg-9 does not . simulations of mgg-11 with @xmath17 ( @xmath24 ) reached core collapse@xcite before 1myr </S>",
    "<S> . models with @xmath23 ( @xmath25 ) also showed some increase in central density , but the maximum density was much lower ( and occurred later ) because the collapse was stopped by supernova mass loss after @xmath21 myr . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a collision runaway could not occur in these clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> figure[fig : tdf_c ] summarizes the results of our simulations , illustrating how both high initial concentration and short dynamical friction time scales are needed to lead to a collision runaway . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the parameters for mgg-9 and mgg-11 , we also indicate on the figure the location of the young star cluster [ w99]1@xcite , one of several star clusters in the antennae system for which accurate structure parameters have been determined @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its parameters are quite similar to those of mgg-9 . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster [ w99]1 has a bright @xmath26 erg / s x - ray point source as a counterpart,@xcite the luminosity of which is consistent with a `` normal '' high - mass x - ray binary containing a magnetized neutron star or a stellar - mass black hole @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> star clusters such as mgg-11 , mgg-9 and [ w99]1 are richly populated with black holes and neutron stars  based on our adopted mass function , we expect these clusters to contain some 1400 stellar - mass black holes and up to about 1000 neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of an ordinary high - mass x - ray binary is therefore not surprising .    </S>",
    "<S> the relevant parameters of five other young clusters in the antennae@xcite all fall far to the right of figure [ fig : tdf_c ] and are therefore not expected to contain imbhs . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the absence of ultraluminous x - ray sources in these clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the milky way galaxy contains ( at least ) four young dense star clusters , of which the arches , quintuplet , and ngc 3603 have the right conditions for multiple stellar collisions to occur . </S>",
    "<S> however , the relatively small number of stars in these systems may prevent the growth of an object massive enough to collapse to an imbh . in any case , these clusters are currently too young to have experienced any supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the slightly older star cluster westerlund 1@xcite is sufficiently massive , and fulfills the criteria for producing an imbh via the process described above . </S>",
    "<S> so far , no bright x - ray source has been found in this cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> based on theoretical considerations , supported by extensive numerical simulations , we have shown that an imbh of mass @xmath278003000 is expected to form through runaway collisions in the star cluster mgg-11 , but not in mgg-9 . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement for the formation of such an imbh in mgg-11 is that the cluster was born with @xmath28 and @xmath29myr . while high by the standards of typical open and globular clusters observed in our galaxy , </S>",
    "<S> such a density is not uncommon among young ( @xmath30myr old ) star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> examples include ngc3603 ( @xmath31)@xcite in the milky way galaxy , and r136 in the 30 doradus region of the lmc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the imbh thus formed is the origin of the @xmath32 erg / s ultraluminous x - ray point source seen at the position of mgg-11 .    </S>",
