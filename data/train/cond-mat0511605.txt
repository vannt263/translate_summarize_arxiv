    "dendrimers are highly branched polymeric macromolecules .",
    "they are synthesized from monomers that can form bonds with at least three other monomers .",
    "starting from a suitable central molecule , a number of generations of monomers are sequentially added . with the addition of each successive generation ,",
    "the dendrimer becomes increasingly branched in its internal structure.@xcite a dendrimer with @xmath0 generations of monomers is denoted a g@xmath0 dendrimer .",
    "dendrimers have numerous technological applications  for example in the targeted delivery of drugs@xcite and , in particular , anti - cancer agents,@xcite in light - harvesting applications,@xcite and also as a tool for the development of nonviral gene delivery.@xcite in a dendrimer solution , the individual macromolecules feature different conformations due to fluctuations of the monomers .",
    "however , statistically one finds that the intra - molecular monomer distribution is almost spherically symmetric . for the statistical behavior of the ensemble of macromolecules only the average over all conformations and orientations of the interacting dendrimers",
    "has to be taken into account , provided no phases with orientational order appear .",
    "this suggests treating the interaction between dendrimers via radially symmetric effective pair potentials , even though a dendrimer is a complex , structured object .",
    "also , given the number of degrees of freedom in each dendrimer , determining the structure and phase behavior of suspensions of dendrimers starting from an atomistic view point is a tough problem .",
    "obtaining an effective interaction potential between pairs of dendrimers ( e.g.  between the centres of mass ) is a way to surmount this .",
    "in such a procedure , one is effectively integrating in the partition function over the internal monomeric degrees of freedom of each dendrimer , resulting in an effective hamiltonian for the dendrimer mixture that treats each dendrimer as a point particle.@xcite however , in principle such an effective hamiltonian also includes effective three - body and higher body effective interactions between the particles.@xcite for dendrimers in solution one finds that these three and higher body interactions are small compared to the two - body potentials,@xcite so neglecting these higher body terms in the effective hamiltonian is justified .",
    "given an effective hamiltonian for point particles one can then determine the fluid structure and phase behavior by means of theory or simulations .",
    "thus , effective interactions are a powerful tool to bridge the length scales and to extract macroscopic properties of dendrimer solutions from microscopic details .",
    "in this paper we use such an approach to study binary dendrimer mixtures .",
    "we find that all effective pair potentials between dendrimers take a gaussian form.@xcite the parameters in these potentials depend strongly on the specific dendrimer architectures , to the extent that we can ` tune ' their range and strength by changing the number of generations and flexibility between monomers in the dendrimers .",
    "this enables us to study the occurrence of a number of phenomena that have been predicted for gaussian mixtures , such as bulk fluid - fluid demixing@xcite and micro - phase separation.@xcite micro - phase separation@xcite is characterized by a transition in the fluid to a state with undamped periodic concentration fluctuations which is thought to indicate a thermodynamic transition to a rather unusual crystalline state.@xcite when gaussian mixtures are subject to geometrical confinement , pattern formation can spontaneously arise.@xcite we find dendrimer mixtures exhibiting all these phenomena .",
    "thus , we are able to demonstrate that the rich phenomenology encountered in gaussian mixtures corresponds to _ real _ systems .    this paper is laid out as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : eff_pair_pots ] we describe our procedure for determining the effective pair potentials in dendrimer mixtures and give results for two particular systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we briefly describe theories that apply for gaussian mixtures and then in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present theory and simulation results for the bulk structure and phase behavior of particular dendrimer mixtures . in sec .",
    "[ sec : confined ] we present theory and simulation results for two particular dendrimer mixtures confined in spherical cavities . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "it has been shown by means of monomer - resolved simulations and theory , that the effective pair potentials between the centres of mass of dendrimers in a good solvent can be modelled by a purely repulsive gaussian potential of the form:@xcite @xmath1 , where the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 depend strongly upon the parameters characterizing the dendrimer s specific architecture .",
    "in particular , they are both affected by the terminal generation number and the bond length between successive generations .",
    "it is therefore possible to ` tune ' the effective interactions by modifying these parameters .",
    "this result has also been confirmed by making comparison with experimental results.@xcite in the present work we determine the effective pair potential between _ different _ types of dendrimers .",
    "we find that in binary mixtures , these can also be well approximated by gaussian functions of different ranges and strengths .",
    "the pair potential between two dendrimers of species @xmath4 and @xmath5 thus takes the form : @xmath6 where the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 depend strongly on the specific properties of the two types of dendrimers in question .    in order to obtain the effective interaction potentials between a pair of dendrimers , we employed a simple coarse - grained model , the so - called bead - thread model,@xcite which treats the monomers as hard spheres of diameter @xmath9 , connected by ideal threads of maximum extension @xmath10 .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 corresponds to the length of the polymer chains between two branching points in the dendrimer . increasing the number of chemical bonds between two branching points leads to an increase in flexibility of the polymer and thus to softer but",
    "more long ranged effective interactions between dendrimers .",
    "large values of @xmath11 are used to model dendrimers with open structures and compact dendrimers are modelled by choosing a smaller value of @xmath11 .",
    "as the number of generations ( monomers ) is increased , the radius of the molecule , of course , increases and the average monomer density inside the molecule grows as well . for a fixed number of monomers in the dendrimer , the value of the effective pair potential for complete overlap of the centres of mass of a pair of dendrimers decreases upon increasing @xmath11 . upon increasing the generation number @xmath12 , keeping @xmath11",
    "fixed , the effective interaction becomes more repulsive because of the exponential growth of the monomer number with @xmath12 . by varying @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ", one can easily modify the dendrimer architecture and thereby systematically ` tune ' the effective pair potential between dendrimers of the same kind.@xcite however , it is much less straightforward to a priori determine the cross - interaction between two dendrimers with different values for the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 . at the same time , employing mixtures of different dendrimer types dramatically increases the freedom to tailor the macroscopic properties of the system .    to determine effective dendrimer interactions @xmath13 in a binary mixture , we employ monomer - resolved monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations of the bead - thread model for dendrimers of different generations and varying thread length @xmath11 .",
    "we simulate pairs of dendrimers of species @xmath4 and @xmath5 and determine in the simulation the probability @xmath14 of finding their centers of mass separated by distance @xmath15 .",
    "thereafter , the effective potential @xmath16 can be obtained using the relation : @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the inverse temperature and @xmath19 , are the partial radial distribution functions.@xcite due to the strong repulsion for complete overlap between dendrimers , we use biased mc , as described in ref .  , to obtain the effective potentials .",

    "a rich variety of one- , two- , or three - dimensionally modulated structures ( cylinders , lamellae , crystals ) , similar to that encountered in block copolymer blends or in ternary oil / water / surfactant mixtures could be expected here as well .",

    "<S> we consider two different types of dendrimer mixtures , employing the gaussian effective pair potentials , to determine the bulk fluid structure and phase behavior . using a simple mean field density functional theory ( dft ) we find good agreement between theory and simulation results for the bulk fluid structure . depending on the mixture , we find bulk fluid - fluid phase separation ( macro - phase separation ) or micro - phase separation , i.e. , a transition to a state characterized by undamped periodic concentration fluctuations . </S>",
