    "the fast wind of a massive star can sweep the ambient medium into a shell and form a wind - blown bubble ( c.f .",
    "weaver et al . 1977 )",
    "if the ambient density is sufficiently high , the swept - up shell should appear as a  ring nebula \" in h@xmath0  images .",
    "ring nebulae are frequently seen around evolved stars with copious stellar winds , such as wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars and luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) ; however , ring nebulae are rarely seen around unevolved massive stars , such as main - sequence o stars @xcite . in fact , no main - sequence o stars in the galaxy possess well - defined optical ring nebulae .",
    "the paucity of optical ring nebulae around unevolved massive stars is puzzling , as early - type o dwarfs may have stellar winds with terminal velocities of @xmath12,000 km  s@xmath2 and mass loss rates of a few @xmath310@xmath4 m@xmath5  yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "three possible explanations exist : ( 1 ) no careful , systematic searches for ring nebulae around main - sequence massive stars have been conducted , ( 2 ) main - sequence massive stars preferentially reside in low density media , and ( 3 ) the microstructure of the interstellar medium prohibits the formation or the visibility of wind - blown bubbles ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    to search for bubbles blown by unevolved massive stars ,",
    "we have chosen to observe two young ob associations in dense hii  regions in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "ob associations are selected , so that a large number of stars can be imaged in the same frame .",
    "the  young age \" criterion is used to avoid confusing supernova remnants ( snrs ) and superbubbles , which are formed by evolved stars .",
    "the dense hii  region environment is required to ensure a reasonably dense medium around the massive stars .",
    "the two ob associations we have selected are lh10 and lh117 @xcite in the hii  regions n11b and n180b @xcite , respectively .",

    "the two most prominent small dust clouds are situated close to luminous stars , so their surfaces are ionized and emit strongly in h@xmath0 : the kiwi - shaped dust cloud to the west of pgmw 3204 and pgmw 3209 , and the y - shaped dust cloud to the west of pgmw 3223 ( see fig .",
    "[ n11]c ) .",
    "interestingly , the tip of the y - shaped dust cloud harbors a bright star , and our echelle observations (  3.1.3 ) show that this bright star has a strong h@xmath0  emission line .",
    "several smaller dust clouds are present but at larger distances from luminous o stars , so their h@xmath0  surface brightnesses are not as high as those close to luminous o stars .    to quantitatively analyze these images ,",
    "we have measured the h@xmath0   surface brightness in several regions of interest .",
    "we then compute the emission measure , @xmath23 , using : @xmath24  pc  cm@xmath4 , where @xmath26 is the electron temperature and @xmath27 is the intrinsic surface brightness in units of ergs @xmath28 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 @xcite . adopting an electron temperature of 10@xmath29 k and assuming that the depth of emitting material along the line of sight is similar to the observed size of a morphological feature",
    ", we may further estimate the rms electron density of the emitting material .",
    "if the feature is not spherical , the observed width ( the shorter dimension ) and length ( the longer dimension ) are used as the path - length of emission to determine the upper and lower limits of the rms density , respectively .",
    "we assume that the density structure of n11b consists of local density enhancements superposed on a global , uniform component .",
    "for the global component , we have measured the surface brightness of a featureless region at 9  east and 14 north of pgmw 3168 , and derived @xmath27 = 9.6@xmath310@xmath30 ergs @xmath28 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 , corresponding to an em@xmath31 of 1.1@xmath310@xmath32 cm@xmath4 pc , taking into account an interstellar absorption with an e(b - v ) value of 0.17 ( pgmw ) .",
    "the size of n11b , measured from the h@xmath0  image in fig .",
    "[ n11]a , is 257  @xmath3 140 , or 64 pc @xmath3 35 pc for a distance of 50 kpc .",
    "the rms electron density of the global component in n11b is thus 13 to 18 @xmath33 in n11b .",

    "are surrounded by filamentary features that are commonly identified as ring nebulae .",
    "the star pgmw 3120 , classified as o5.5v((f * ) ) by pgmw , is surrounded in the northeast by a small arc - like structure at @xmath35 from the star .",
    "the arc does not stand out in the [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio map , suggesting a similar excitation to the background hii  region , or a lack of strong shock excitation .",
    "the star pgmw 3160 , a k i star , is in a faint void bordered in the southwest by a bright filament @xmath36 long .",
    "this filament has a lower [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio than the background hii  region ; however , the filament does not appear to be associated with an obvious dusty feature .",
    "a few stars are surrounded by faint filaments , e.g. , pgmw 3239 ( b2v ) , pgmw 3157 ( bc1ia ) , and pgmw 3102 ( o7v ) .",
    "some stars , e.g. , pgmw 3089 ( o8v ) , are inside regions with suppressed surface brightness , indicating lower densities around the star , as in a cavity .",
    "none of these features stand out in the [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio map ; therefore , from their excitation alone , they are indistinguishable from the background hii  region , indicating that they are not shock - excited .",
    "while no sharp , high-[oiii]/h@xmath0  features are detected , many prominent low-[oiii]/h@xmath0  features are present , and most of them are associated with dusty features .",
    "the correlation between low [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratios and dusty features can be illustrated by the analysis of an isolated dust cloud .",
    "we use the kiwi - shaped dust cloud as an example .",
    "figure  [ bird ] shows that the low-[oiii]/h@xmath0  region delineates the surface of the dust cloud .",
    "the h@xmath0  and [ oiii ]  surface brightness profiles along a north - south cut across the kiwi - shaped dust cloud show that the h@xmath0  emission and [ oiii ]  emission on the cloud surface peak at the same location , but the [ oiii ]  emission drops off faster into the dust cloud than the h@xmath0  emission , causing a dip in the [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio .",
    "therefore , the low [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratios on the surface of a dust cloud is caused by a lower ionization and excitation .",
    "this kiwi - shaped dust cloud and the y - shaped dust cloud are both strongly ionized on the sides facing the o3iii(f * ) star pgmw 3209 , the earliest and most luminous o star in the vicinity .",
    "these dust clouds are most likely illuminated and ionized by this o star .      to identify kinematic features caused by wind - ism interactions , we examine the velocity profiles of both h@xmath0  and [ nii ]   @xmath146584 lines .",
    "the [ nii ]  line shows line splitting more easily because its thermal width is smaller than that of h@xmath0 , but the [ nii ]  line is much weaker than the h@xmath0  line and is usually noisier .",
    "variations of ionization condition ( [ nii]/h@xmath0  ratio ) among different velocity components also contribute to differing appearances of the h@xmath0  and [ nii ]  line profiles .",

    "there are 30-pc - long dust streamers running across the face of the hii  region , prominent antenna - shaped dust cloud at the northeastern corner of the field , large patches of dust clouds at the northwestern and southwestern corners of the field , and bok - globule - like small dust clouds embedded in ionized gas near the large dust clouds .",
    "these dusty features amply portray a young star formation region .",
    "the h@xmath0  surface brightness is heavily modulated by the large - scale dusty features .",

    "as shown below , this higher surface brightness is caused by a higher density in this region .",

    "we measured the surface brightness of a featureless region at 35 north and 17  west of the star mgsd 119 to represent the global component .",
    "adopting a diameter of 225(or 56 pc ) for n180b and an e(b - v ) value of 0.12 ( mgsd ) , we derive a rms density of @xmath19.5 @xmath33 .",

    "mgsd 168 is a mid b star , so the h@xmath0  emission from its neighboring dust cloud is weak compared to the background h@xmath0  emission from gas ionized by early o stars , while the kiwi - shaped dust cloud in n11b is ionized by early o stars and its emission is much brighter than the background emission",
    ". therefore the low [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio in the ionization front can be more easily seen in dust clouds near early o stars than later o or b stars .",
    "the arc around mgsd 218 has a low [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio , 0.45 , indicating a low excitation at an ionization front .",

    "mgsd 218 is a mid b main sequence star and could be luminous enough to produce a small hii  region .",
    "the filamentary nebula around mgsd 174 may also have a low [ oiii]/h@xmath0   ratio , but the s / n ratio of this region ( imaged by the planetary camera of wfpc2 ) is too low to confirm the low [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio .",
    "many nebular morphological features `` disappear '' into the background in the [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratio map .",
    "the small `` comet - tail '' nebulosity of mgsd 106 and the large ( 20 pc in size ) , bright , v - shaped emission region both show [ oiii]/h@xmath0  ratios similar to the average ratio of the entire hii  region .",

    "three types of wind - blown bubbles are seen in those young hii  regions : ( 1 ) bubbles around concentrations of massive stars within which the projected separation between neighboring stars are typically @xmath45 1 pc , ( 2 ) bubbles around individual o stars if the distance to neighboring stars is large enough to maintain the individuality of the bubble , and ( 3 ) a fossil bubble around an evolved red supergiant that is isolated .",
    "it is conceivable that the formation of wind - blown bubbles or superbubbles in an hii  region depends crucially on the spatial distribution of the stars .",
    "tight concentrations of massive stars are conducive to the formation of superbubbles even before any supernova explosion .",
    "wide separations between massive stars are conducive to the formation of single - star , main - sequence bubbles , and a bubble may remain distinct even after the star has evolved into a red supergiant .",

    "we adopt the rms densities we have determined for n11b and n180b , 15 h - atom  @xmath33 and 9.5 h - atom  @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "we have listed in table  [ bubsum ] the observed diameter and expansion velocity of the expanding shells , together with the derived dynamical timescale and wind luminosity .",
    "we have also listed the early - type stars encompassed within each shell and the stellar wind luminosity expected from these stars .",
    "we will focus on the two best - defined shells in our sample .",
    "first we consider the bubble blown by the o34 star mgsd 214 in n180b . with a radius of 11 pc and an expansion velocity of @xmath120 ^-1kms@xmath2 , the bubble around mgsd 214",
    "has a dynamical timescale of 3.3@xmath310@xmath56 yr . adopting n180b s rms density of @xmath19.5 @xmath33 , we find a wind luminosity of @xmath13@xmath310@xmath53 ergs  s@xmath2 for mgsd 214 .",
    "this is a factor of 10 lower than that expected from an o34 star .",
    "next we consider the bubble blown by pgmw 3204 , 3209 , and 3223 in n11b .",
    "the star pgmw 3209 , while dominated by an o3iii(f * ) star , is in fact composed of at least 5 additional late o stars @xcite . for a radius of 7 pc and an expansion velocity of 10 ^-1kms@xmath2 ,",
    "the dynamical timescale of this bubble is 4.2@xmath310@xmath56 yr . using a rms density of 15 @xmath33 for n11b , we expect a wind luminosity of @xmath12.5@xmath310@xmath57 ergs  s@xmath2 for pgmw 3209 , two orders of magnitude lower than that expected from an o3iii star .",
    "this discrepancy is even larger , if we consider the additional stars in pgmw 3209 and the neighboring stars pgmw 3204 and 3223 .",
    "the large discrepancy between stellar wind luminosities derived from observations and models of bubbles and those expected from the actual stellar content is very interesting .",
    "similar discrepancy has been reported for circumstellar bubbles ( e.g. , ngc  6888 ; * ? ? ? * ) and superbubbles @xcite .",
    "our results represent the first report for small interstellar bubbles .",
    "this discrepancy implies that either the observed stellar wind luminosities have been over - estimated or weaver et al.s model can not describe the observed bubbles .",
    "if the observed stellar wind luminosity is correct , our observed bubbles will be too small and expand too slowly . to reduce the discrepancy",
    ", we need to increase the ambient density , but it is unlikely that we have under - estimated the rms density of the hii  regions by factors of 10100 .",
    "one further discrepancy underscores the deficiency of bubble models .",
    "the dynamical timescales of the bubbles in n11b , 0.10.5 myr , are much shorter than the age of the ob association lh10 , 23 myr @xcite .",
    "a similar discrepancy is also observed in superbubbles @xcite .",
    "these problems need to be seriously considered in the future .",
    "the content and distribution of wind - blown bubbles in n11b are different from those in n180b : n11b has a larger number of wind - blown bubbles and faster - expanding bubbles .",
    "this difference is caused by the richness of massive stars in the encompassed ob associations .",
    "the ob association lh10 in n11b has 20 stars with stellar masses @xmath58 m@xmath5 ( pgmw ) , while the ob association lh118 in n180b only has six ( mgsd ) .",
    "futhermore , lh10 has tighter concentrations of massive stars than lh118 .",
    "bubbles blown by concentrations of massive stars expand faster because of more powerful stellar winds .",
    "therefore , n11b has more bubbles and the fastest expanding bubble is around its highest concentration of massive stars .    one property in common among the bubbles in n11b and n180b is the asymmetric structure  most of the bubbles are  blisters \" .",
    "a face - on blister can be diagnosed from the asymmetry in line profiles , which show a bright component near the hii  region s systemic velocity and a faint component blue - shifted or red - shifted to higher velocities .",
    "a blister viewed from the side can be diagnosed by the displacement of the responsible star from the projected bubble center .",
    "as the stars in n11b and n180b are still young and must be located close to their birth places , their blister - like bubbles suggest that the stars are located near the surface of a dense cloud , where a density gradient is present ; as opposed to embedded in the deep interior of a cloud , where the ambient density might be more uniform .",
    "finally , we note that numerous small dust clouds like bok globules and elephant trunks are detected in n11b and n180b .",
    "if the ambient interstellar gas pressure is high enough , star formation might be triggered in these small dust clouds .",
    "at least one such cloud in n11b , the y - shaped dust cloud near pgmw 3223 , shows signs of on - going star formation at its tip .",
    "an infrared survey of n11b and n180b would reveal whether star formation has started in other small dust clouds .    we would like to thank michael dopita for prompt review and constructive suggestions .",

    "<S> the number and distribution of bubbles in n11b differ from those in n180b , which can be explained by the difference in the richness of stellar content between these two hii  regions . </S>",
    "<S> most of the bubbles observed in n11b and n180b show a blister - structure , indicating that the stars were formed on the surfaces of dense clouds . </S>",
    "<S> numerous small dust clouds , similar to bok globules or elephant trunks , are detected in these hii  regions and at least one of them hosts on - going star formation . </S>"
