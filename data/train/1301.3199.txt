    "we propose that there are two modes of cluster formation ; one is coeval cluster formation , the other is non - coeval one .",
    "this difference is related to their environments ( existence or non - existence of the h ii region ) of the associated clumps .",
    "h ii regions play three roles : ( 1 ) they accumulate the dense gas by an expanding shell , ( 2 ) they shape the dense component into a filament , and ( 3 ) they inject energy",

    "if the differences of cluster - forming modes depend on the differences of the environments of the clumps , some unknown issues of cluster formation ( e.g. , imf , star formation efficiency , age spread of the cluster members ) can be clarified by carrying out such an investigation toward the clumps in the early stages of the cluster formation ( e.g.,@xmath2irdcs ) .",
    "although more statistical studies should be needed , these studies will lead the understanding the fundamental topic of the cluster formation .",
