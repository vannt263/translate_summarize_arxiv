    "one important constraint on the moduli space of vacua of supersymmetric gauge theories  @xcite is that the massless fermions in the low energy theory should have the same flavor anomalies as the fundamental fields , i.e.the t  hooft consistency conditions should be satisfied  @xcite . these conditions are considered a particularly stringent test on the spectrum of massless fermions , which is usually obtained from symmetry arguments and renormalization group flows .",
    "it is found that for some theories the classical moduli space @xmath1 or a suitable quantum modified version @xmath2 of it satisfies t  hooft consistency conditions at every point .",
    "other theories fail t  hooft s test at some vacua , and it is believed that in the infrared , these theories correspond to the weak coupling sector of a dual theory with a different gauge group and matter content  @xcite . in this paper , sufficient conditions on the fundamental chiral field content @xmath3 for a theory to satisfy the t  hooft conditions is established .",
    "this is usually done by first finding a basic set of gauge invariants @xmath4 and the constraints among them , then checking point by point the matching of flavor anomalies between the fundamental fields and the composites at each point on the moduli space .",
    "this procedure involves tedious calculations , and does not offer a systematic approach to the problem of determining whether @xmath1 ( or a suitable quantum modified version of it ) gives the right description of the infrared sector or not .",
    "our results establish simple sufficient conditions on the fundamental fields that guarantee t  hooft consistency conditions will be satisfied .",
