    "the character of nonlinear response under the ultrafast interband excitation of an intrinsic graphene is determined by a several physical processes which are dependent on conditions of pumping . under a low excitation level ,",
    "when the one - photon transitions take place , the energy relaxation and recombination of photoexcited carriers were studied with the use of the time - resolved pump - probe measurements , see experimental data and theoretical discussions in refs . 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "under an extremely high pumping , the multi - quantum transitions , which cause the harmonics generation and the hybridization of electron - hole states , take place .",
    "this regime is not investigated completely for graphene , see general consideration for bulk materials or quantum wells in sects .",
    "10 and 56 of ref .",
    "the nonlinear response is also possible within the single - photon approach because the rabi oscillations of coherent response should take place in graphene if a pulse duration is less 100 fs .",
    "@xcite beside of this , the nonlinear regime of energy relaxation and recombination due to the pauli blocking effect takes place if the photogeneration rate is comparable to the energy relaxation or recombination rates .",
    "a saturation of transient absorption , which have been investigated recently , @xcite is the most important manifistation of such a regime .",
    "it is because this phenomenon was exploited for realization of an ultrafast laser with a graphene saturable absorber in the telecommunication spectral region . to the best of our knowledge , a complete theoretical treatment of the saturation mechanism",
    "is not performed yet and an investigation of this phenomena is timely now .    in this paper , we consider the temporal nonlinear evolution of carriers under photoexcitation by the ultrafast pulses in mid - ir and visible ( or near - ir ) spectral regions .",
    "for the mid - ir pump , one can neglect the relaxation and recombination processes ( the quasielastic relaxation due to acoustic phonons remains uneffective up to nanoseconds ) and the transient distribution of nonequilibrium carriers is determined by the broadening of interband transitions due to an elastic scattering and by the parameters of excitation . for the excitation energies , @xmath0 , above the optical phonon energy , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 labels the phonon modes correspondent to the intra- and intervalley transitions ) , when a cascade emission of the optical phonons dominates in relaxation , the transient distribution transforms into a set of peaks .",
    "the effective electron - hole recombination takes place if the lowest peak is placed around the half - energy of optical phonon , @xmath3 . so that , the character of response modifies essentially if the frequency @xmath4 varies over the @xmath5-range .",
    "the saturation process is described within the framework of the temporally local approach , when the decoherentization time ( which determines the broadening of the interband transitions ) is shorter in comparision with the duration of pumping .",
    "spectral and temporal dependencies of the photoexcited concentration and the response on the probe radiation ( transmission and absorption coefficients ) are presented .",
    "the thresholds for saturation of response are estimated to be about 0.2 mw/@xmath6 , 60 mw/@xmath6 , and 0.6 gw/@xmath6 for @xmath70.12 , 0.8 , and 1.5 ev , respectively ( mid - ir , near - ir , and visible spectral regions ) .",
    "these results are dependent on the decoherentization and relaxation mechanisms and the electrodynamics conditions .",
    "their are discussed in comparison with the experimental data for the near - ir pumping case @xcite .",
    "conditions for the transient negative absorption of a probe radiation during cascade emission of optical phonons are also analyzed ( this phenomenon under a steady - state pumping was considered recently @xcite in connection with a possibility of the thz lasing effect ) .    the consideration below is organized as follows . the temporally local approach for description of the response of photoexcited carriers",

    "<S> spectral and temporal dependencies of the photoexcited concentration as well as the transmission and relitive absotption coefficients are considered for mid - ir and visible ( or near - ir ) spectral regions at different durations of pulse and broadening energies . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic intencities of saturation are calculated and the results are compared with the experimental data measured for the near - ir lasers with a saturable absorber . </S>",
    "<S> the negative absorption of a probe radiation during cascade emission of optical phonons is obtained . </S>"
