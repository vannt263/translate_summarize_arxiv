    "it is also clear that for @xmath177 the intensity of the burst ( see also fig .",
    "[ 3gamma ] ) and the observed radiation frequency drifted to smaller and smaller values and are of little astrophysical interest from the point of view of grbs .",

    "the number of @xmath0 pairs has now been reduced drastically .",

    "after the collision , there is a small reheating due to the annihilation of the @xmath0 pairs created in the collision ( see fig .",
    "[ pair ] ) , which can not be seen on the scale of our plot .",

    "by the direct comparison with the numerical integration of the complete relativistic hydrodynamical equations , the use of the constant - thickness approximation has been validated for values of the parameter @xmath198 . for @xmath199 the amount of energy released at transparency in the burst decreases , and its energy drifts toward low energy values , which are of little interest for the astrophysics of grb .",
    "we conclude that the constant - thickness approximation is valid for all astrophysically relevant situations for the analysis of the grb at transparency .",
