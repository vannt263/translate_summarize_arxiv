    "+      it is very common to make the reasonable assumption that the topology of space - time is fixed .",
    "we assume that space - time is a manifold of the form @xmath5 , and that for each , we have a space - like surface that is always homeomorphic to a given @xmath6 .",
    "however , when ( quantum ) gravity is taken into account , the very geometry of space becomes a degree of freedom , and one can conceive the possibility that @xmath6 changes in the course of time @xcite . such a process is called topology change .",
    "creation of baby universes , production of topological defects ( cosmic strings , domain walls ) , and changes in genus ( production of wormholes and topological geons ) are examples of topology change . each of them have received some attention in the literature .",
    "several authors have investigated topology change within the context of both classical and quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the usual canonical approach to gravity , only the metric of the spatial manifold @xmath6 appears as a degree of freedom and receives a quantum treatment .",
    "the topology of @xmath6 in its turn is implicitly treated as a classical entity .",
    "there are , of course , other approaches to quantum gravity such as string theory @xcite and euclidean quantum gravity @xcite where topology may appear as an entity of a quantum nature via a sum over topologies",
    ".    it would be desirable to have a formalism where topology can in a certain sense be canonically quantized and if possible separated from degrees of freedom coming from metric and other fields . in spite of the fact that topology change has been inspired by quantum gravity , it has been demonstrated in @xcite that it can happen in ordinary quantum mechanics . in this approach",
    ", metric is not dynamical , but degrees of freedom related to topology are quantized .",
    "the notion of a space with a well defined topology appears only as a classical limit .",
    "( see also @xcite for related ideas ) .",
    "the views we would like to present in this paper are similar , to a certain extent , to the ones in @xcite . in our approach , variables related to topology are separated from other degrees of freedom and then quantized .    the topology of space is well captured by soliton - like excitations of @xmath6 called topological geons .",
    "they can be thought of as lumps of nontrivial topology .",
    "for example , in , the topology of an orientable , closed surface @xmath6 is determined by the number of connected components of @xmath6 and by the number of of handles on each connected component .",
    "each handle corresponds to a topological geon , i.e. , a localized lump of nontrivial topology .",
    "it is well known that these solitons have particle like properties such as spin and statistics .",
    "however unlike ordinary particles they can violate the spin - statistics relation @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the standard spin - statistics relation can be recovered if one considers processes where geons are ( possibly pairwise ) created and annihilated , but this necessarily implies a change of the topology of @xmath6 . in other words , one may have to consider topology change in order to have a spin - statistics theorem for geons @xcite .",
    "the euclidean path integral approach can in some sense be carried out in low dimensions @xcite , but it represents a formidable task in the case of a @xmath7 theory .",
    "it would be nice to stay closer to a `` canonical '' quantization , even though topology change and the canonical approach appear to be incompatible .",
    "one may search for alternative descriptions of topological properties using algebraic tools , very much in the spirit of quantum invariants of knot theory .",
    "the polynomial invariants of knots can be obtained by both field theoretic and algebraic methods . in the field theoretical approach ,",
    "it is well known that jones polynomials are obtained by means of functional integrals of chern - simons theory @xcite . in the algebraic approach ,",
    "one obtains invariants by representations of the braid group @xcite , or via hopf algebras @xcite .",
    "we will try in this paper to give an algebraic description of quantum geons , rather than a field theoretical one .",
    "we will present a theory of quantized topological geons where topology change is a quantum transition .",
    "we will only analyze the case of orientable geons in @xmath8 were handles are the only possible `` particles '' . a generalization to include nonorientable geons",
    "will be presented elsewhere .",
    "let us consider a manifold @xmath9 and some generic field theory ( possibly with gauge and higgs fields ) interacting with gravity .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that if we could quantize such a complex theory , its observables would give us information on the geometry and topology of @xmath9 .",
    "the main point is that one does not need to consider the full theory to get some topological information .",
    "it is possible that , in a certain low energy ( large distance ) limit , there would be a certain set of observables encoding the topological data .",
    "we know examples where this is precisely the case . in general , the low energy ( large distance ) limit of a field theory",
    "is not able to probe details of the short distance physics , but it can isolate degrees of freedom related to topology",
    ". we may give as an example the low energy limit of @xmath10 super yang - mills , known as the seiberg - witten theory @xcite .",
    "we also have examples of more drastic reduction where a field theory in the vacuum state becomes purely topological @xcite .",
    "inspired by these facts we will identify the degrees of freedom , or the algebra @xmath11 of `` observables '' , capable of describing @xmath12 topological geons in @xmath8 . actually , we will argue later in this paper that the operators in this algebra are not really observables in the strict sense .",
    "rather , it is what is called @xcite a _ field algebra_. we say that @xmath13 describes a single geon in the same way that the algebra of angular momentum describes a single spinning particle . in this framework",
    "what we mean by quantizing the system is nothing but finding irreducible representations of @xmath13 . as in the case of the algebra of angular momentum ,",
    "different irreducible representations have to be thought of as different _ particles_. for the moment , we will not be concerned with dynamical aspects .",
    "we would like to concentrate on the quantization itself and leave the dynamics to be fixed by the particular model one wants to consider .",
    "an intuitive way of understanding the algebra @xmath13 for a topological geon comes from considering a gauge theory with gauge group @xmath14 in two space dimensions spontaneously broken to a discrete group @xmath15 . for simplicity we will assume that @xmath15 is finite . as an immediate consequence it follows that the gauge connection ( at far distances ) is locally flat . in other words ,",
    "homotopic loops @xmath16 and @xmath17 produce the same parallel transport ( holonomy ) .",
    "the set of independent holonomies are therefore parametrized by elements @xmath18 $ ] in the fundamental group @xmath19 .",
    "it is quite clear that such quantities are enough to detect the presence of a handle .",
    "the phase space we are interested in contains only topological degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore such holonomies can be thought of as playing the role of position variables .",
    "we also have to take into account the diffeomorphisms that are able to change @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "they will be somewhat the analogues of translations .",
    "it is clear that the connected component of the group of diffeomorphisms , the so - called small diffeos , can not change the homotopy class of @xmath16 . to change the homotopy class of a curve @xmath16 one needs to act with the so - called large diffeomorphisms .",
    "therefore the analogues of translations have to be parametrized by the large diffeos modulo the small diffeos .",
    "this is exactly the mapping class group @xmath20 .",
    "also , we must take into account an action of the group @xmath15 , changing the holonomies by a conjugation .",
    "this action , as we will discuss later , corresponds physically to `` encircling flux sources at infinity '' .",
    "these three sets of quantities will comprise our algebra @xmath13 .",
    "contrary to what happens in field theory or even in quantum mechanics , we find that @xmath13 is finite dimensional .",
    "this will be important to avoid technical problems of various kinds .",
    "the algebra @xmath13 contains the analogue of positions and translations and can be thought of as a discrete weyl algebra .",
    "there seems to be no great obstacle to generalize our results also to the case where @xmath15 is a lie group @xcite .",
    "our algebraic description of geons is analogous to what has been developed for @xmath21 non - abelian vortices by the amsterdam group @xcite .",
    "these ideas have been further developed by some of us and coworkers and applied to rings in @xmath7 .",
    "their results will not be discussed here since a complete account will be reported in @xcite .",
    "the algebra encountered by @xcite was a special type of hopf algebra , namely the drinfeld double of a discrete group @xcite . in our case , however , the algebra @xmath13 is not hopf , but it has a drinfeld double as a subalgebra . for a pair of geons we find that the corresponding algebra @xmath22 is closely related to the tensor product @xmath23 of single geon algebras .",
    "this fact allows us to determine the appropriate algebra @xmath11 for an arbitrary number @xmath12 of geons .",
    "the main result of our analysis is that it gives us some information on topology change at the quantum level .",
    "this is true for geons as well as for particles on the plane @xcite .",
    "our algebra @xmath13 has to do with large distance observations .",
    "in other words , we can only probe low energy aspects of the theory .",
    "we will argue in section [ s5 ] that geons , i.e , handles in the plane , can be created and annihilated in a quantum fashion as a consequence of the scale of observations .",
    "we would like to mention that other types of topology change , like creation of baby universes , do not fit naturally in our framework and will not be considered here .",
    "one advantage of the algebraic approach is that we can do this analysis without going into the details of the `` complete '' underlying field theory .",
    "we can determine the spectrum @xmath24 of the geons , i.e. , the set of possible irreducible representations of @xmath25 , but a particular field theory may restrict the available possibilities in @xmath24 .",
    "the determination of these possibilities requires the study of particular examples of the underlying field theories .",
    "that may be a very difficult task . in this paper",
    "our intention is to use the simplified algebraic `` field '' theory and see what it can teach us .",
    "it is remarkable that such a simple framework can reveal important features of quantum geons such as a constraint involving spin and statistics as well as rules for quantum topology change .",
    "the former connection is investigated in another paper @xcite .",
    "an approach similar to ours is explored in reference @xcite .",
    "its author views the geon as a vortex - antivortex pair , in which case the algebra describing it _ is _ a quantum double .",
    "this description does not consider the internal diffeomorphisms of the geon , as it aims to describe vortices on a two - dimensional surface with handles .",
    "accordingly , in @xcite , the setting is a two - dimensional surface @xmath26 of _ genus _",
    "@xmath27 _ and @xmath12 punctures _ , whereas in this work we consider a @xmath28-surface @xmath29 of _ genus _",
    "@xmath27 _ without punctures_. our approach is also different inasmuch as we are interested in considering `` large diffeormorphisms '' , i.e. , elements of the mapping class group of @xmath29 .",
    "more specifically , in @xcite , the topology of this surface is a passive background where a theory of pointlike vortices is defined , and its author only deals with diffeomorphisms moving particles ( punctures ) around or through handles . to us , the geons ( handles ) themselves , _ including their internal structure _ , are the entities of interest .",
    "the diffeomorphisms moving these handles are the `` large diffeomorphisms '' we mentioned above . as an illustration of the above mentioned differences , in a typical process considered in @xcite",
    ", one can make a test vortex go through or around a handle , whereas in our case one can conceive of `` test geons '' going through other handles .",
    "our procedure allows a natural generalization towards quantum gravity , which is the issue of another paper @xcite .",
    "we recall the notion of topological geons in section [ s2 ] .",
    "a special emphasis is given to orientable geons in @xmath8 .",
    "the field algebra is described in section [ s3 ] .",
    "section [ gasp ] gives the effective description of a geon as seen from a large distance .",
    "the relevant subalgebra @xmath30 is the same as for a point particle .",
    "the representations of @xmath31 will play an important role when we discuss topology .",
    "quantization of the system is given in section [ s4 ] . in this section",
    "we are able to classify the irreducible representations for a class of algebras @xmath32 that includes our algebra of interest as a particular example .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the field algebras for vortices in @xmath8 and for rings in @xmath7 considered in @xcite are also examples of @xmath33 .",
    "section [ s5 ] describes how topology can change in this quantum theory , as a consequence of the scale of observation .",
    "we end with some concluding remarks and prospects of future work .      the term _ geon _ was used for the first time by j.a .",
    "wheeler @xcite to designate a lump of electromagnetic energy held together by its own gravitational field , forming a spatial region of non - zero curvature , typically very small . in the context of this paper , however , this term will have a wholly different meaning , namely it will signify a _ topological _ geon , a soliton - like excitation in topology first discussed by friedman and sorkin @xcite , and whose properties were further elaborated by many authors @xcite . in this section , we review the definition and basic properties of topological geons , and refer the reader to the literature for further details .",
    "we start with some basic preliminary definitions .",
    "let @xmath34,@xmath35 be connected @xmath12-dimensional topological manifolds , possibly with boundaries .",
    "we define their connected sum , @xmath36 , as follows : take @xmath12-balls @xmath37 in the interiors of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and remove their interiors .",
    "we thereby add spheres @xmath40 to the boundaries of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "now identify the points of these spheres via a homeomorphism .",
    "the resulting manifold is @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are oriented , we further require that this homeomorphism be orientation reversing so that @xmath36 is also oriented .",
    "it follows trivially from the definition that @xmath41 is homeomorphic to @xmath9 itself .",
    "the connected sum of two tori is shown on fig .",
    "2.1 .      in this paper we shall be interested in a decomposition of spacetime by spacelike hypersurfaces ( spatial manifolds ) . in dealing with gravity ,",
    "one is usually interested in spacetime metrics which induce an asymptotically flat ( or asymptotically conical , in the @xmath1",
    "case)riemannian metric on each hypersurface . for a certain `` frozen time '' @xmath43 , the hypersurface @xmath44 should therefore be topologically a manifold with one _ asymptotic region _ , i.e. , there exists a compact region @xmath45 whose complement in @xmath44 is homeomorphic to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the dimension of spacetime and @xmath48 is the standard @xmath12-ball in @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "2.2 one can see @xmath1 oriented geons ( which are nothing but handles on a plane , see below ) on a @xmath28-dimensional spatial slice .",
    "this motivates the following definition : an @xmath12-manifold is said to have one asymptotic region iff it is homeomorphic to @xmath50 , where @xmath9 is a closed ( i.e. , compact and boundaryless ) , connected @xmath12-manifold .",
    "typical cases of interest are 2 and 3 manifolds with one asymptotic region , which are to be thought as spatial slices of @xmath0- and @xmath51-dimensional spacetimes respectively .",
    "a plane with a finite number of geons ( handles ) is an example of a manifold with one asymptotic region .",
    "note that all topological complexity can be localized within a circumference @xmath52 , and the geons can be isolated from each other .",
    "outside @xmath52 , one has simply a flat plane .    in 2 and 3 dimensions",
    "it is known @xcite that there exists a class of closed connected manifolds @xmath53 called _ prime _ manifolds .",
    "an @xmath12-manifold @xmath9 is said to be prime iff @xmath54 implies that one of @xmath34 , @xmath35 is an @xmath12-sphere .",
    "one can prove that given any compact @xmath12-manifold ( @xmath55 ) @xmath9 , there exists a unique decomposition m = p_1 # ... # p_n , where @xmath56 .",
    "uniqueness means ( apart from some technicalities - see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that given another decomposition @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 and ( after possible reordering ) @xmath53 is homeomorphic to @xmath59 .",
    "each prime component of @xmath9 is called a topological geon .    in 2 dimensions , ignoring @xmath60 from consideration , the only prime manifolds are @xmath42 , which is orientable , and the `` cross cap '' @xmath61 , which is non - orientable @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will consider only orientable geons , therefore we will have to deal only with @xmath62 . connected sums with @xmath60 are clearly immaterial . in 3 dimensions",
    "there are infinitely many prime manifolds , only partially classified . as examples",
    "we can give the 3-torus @xmath63 and the `` handle '' @xmath64 .    from the aforementioned prime decomposition it is clear that any @xmath12-manifold @xmath9 with an asymptotic region can be decomposed as m=^n # p_1 # ... # p_n . now consider @xmath65 .",
    "one can always find an @xmath66 sphere in @xmath67 whose interior contains @xmath53 . by a suitable choice of the metric this region can be thought of to be as small as one pleases , i.e. , the topological complexity can be localized ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in 2 spatial dimensions",
    "this means that one is allowed to put the handle inside of a circle and suppose the radius of the circle to be very small .",
    "then one has a very small handle surrounded by a vast flat plane .",
    "it is in this sense that we refer to the geon as `` soliton like '' at the beginning of this section : just as a soliton corresponds to a localized excitation of some field , outside of which one has the vacuum , the geon is a localized excitation of the topology itself , the `` vacuum '' in this case being the flat space ( see fig .",
    "2.3 ) . in general",
    ", since @xmath53 is prime , one may say that it represents an elementary topological excitation .",
    "we therefore say that @xmath65 is a space with one geon .",
    "the manifold @xmath68 is therefore seen as a space with @xmath69 geons .",
    "these prime manifolds attached to @xmath70 can be isolated from one another in the same way as we localized one single geon @xcite , and for many purposes one can think of geons as particles .",
    "again , in 2 spatial dimensions one can have many isolated small handles .",
    "the importance of geons to us lies in the fact that , as long as we preserve connectivity and consider a space manifold with one asymptotic region , _ topology change amounts to creation and annihilation of geons_. henceforth we restrain our attention to the case when the space is 2 dimensional , connected and oriented , with one asymptotic region .",
    "we assume , furthermore , that connectivity and orientability are preserved during topology change . although somewhat restrictive , this case is still of much interest .",
    "our assumptions imply , on the other hand , that the geons of interest will be those associated to copies of @xmath42 , i.e. , topology changing processes will mean creation and annihilation of handles on a plane . as we will see below ,",
    "creation and annihilation will have for us a meaning different from the usual geometrical one .",
    "instead they will be related to what a `` distant '' observer will be able to measure from a quantum theoretical standpoint .",
    "our aim in this section is to define some `` observables '' which describe the topological character of a geon .",
    "however , the term `` algebra of observables '' to designate the algebra describing geons would actually be a misnomer , for as we will see shortly , this algebra includes operators which can not be observables . to describe geons",
    ", we will use the low - energy limit of a field theory in their presence . in this limit ,",
    "the theory becomes topological , and therefore provides us with quantities capable of probing the topological features of the background , and hence the geons .",
    "the kind of algebra which we will encounter is composed by a part related to the fields , via their holonomies around non - contractible paths , and to physical operations ( some of them not observable locally ) which may change these holonomies . this algebra is what is known in the literature as a _ field algebra _ ( for a detailed definition , see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we will follow an approach inspired by the work of the amsterdam group , which is reported in ref . @xcite . in this work",
    ", the group investigates the properties of topological solutions of a @xmath8 gauge field theory in minkowski spacetime where the gauge symmetry of a lie group @xmath14 is spontaneously broken to a finite group @xmath15 by a non - vanishing expectation value of a higgs field @xmath71 .",
    "we shall briefly review their discussion , referring the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "the lagrangian is given by = f^a _ f^_a + tr[(d _ ) ^ * ( d^ ) ] - v ( ) , [ higgs ] where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is a lie algebra index . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath14 is connected and simply connected .",
    "the fields @xmath74 are the components of the field strength of the yang - mills potential @xmath75 and @xmath76 denotes the covariant derivative determined by this potential .",
    "the higgs field @xmath71 is in the adjoint representation and can be expanded in terms of generators @xmath77 of the lie algebra of @xmath14 , and @xmath78 is a @xmath14-invariant potential . in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned with the low energy , or equivalently , the long range behavior of this theory , in the temporal gauge @xmath79 .",
    "this is obtained by minimizing the three terms in the energy density separately . minimizing the term corresponding to the energy density of the yang - mills field",
    ", we obtain the condition @xmath80 , from which we conclude that we are dealing only with flat connections .",
    "the minimum of the potential restricts the values of the higgs field to the vacuum manifold , which is invariant by @xmath15 .",
    "finally , the condition @xmath81 , required for minimizing the energy density from the second term , tells us that the holonomies ( ) = p\\ { _ a^a_i t_a ds^i } ; i \\{1,2 } , [ flat ] take values in the finite group @xmath15 .",
    "this gauge theory may have topologically non - trivial , static solutions such as vortices .",
    "it is very well known that the core radii of these vortices are inversely proportional to the mass of the higgs boson , and therefore they may be viewed as point - like in the low - energy regime of the theory .",
    "hence , according to a standard argument , to describe the @xmath69-vortex solutions we may consider solutions for the vortex equations [ static ] f^a_ij & = & 0 ; + d_i&= & 0 ; + v ( ) & = & 0 , on a spacetime of the form @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the plane with @xmath69 punctures , playing the role of the vortices .",
    "now , take a solution @xmath85 for the vortex equations ( [ static ] ) . by fixing a point @xmath86",
    ", the holonomy of @xmath87 around any closed path @xmath88 based at @xmath82 depends only on its homotopy class , since @xmath87 is flat .",
    "it takes values into a subgroup @xmath15 of @xmath14 , which preserves the vacuum manifold , in view of the equations for @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "therefore , any solution of the vortex equations determines a homomorphism @xmath89 , [ homo ] : _ 1 ( ) h , between the fundamental group @xmath90 and the group @xmath15 .",
    "conversely , given such a homomorphism @xmath89 we can define a solution for eqs.([static ] ) in the following way .",
    "take the universal covering space @xmath91 of @xmath84 .",
    "it is the total space of a principal bundle over @xmath84 with structure group @xmath92 . via the homomorphism @xmath89",
    "we can construct an associated principal @xmath15-bundle over @xmath84 , which is a subbundle of the original @xmath14-bundle . since @xmath15 is finite",
    ", this bundle has a unique flat connection @xmath93 , which can be viewed as a reducible connection on the @xmath14-bundle .",
    "we now find a @xmath71 . by fixing some @xmath94 in the vacuum manifold",
    ", we have that , since @xmath71 must be covariantly constant , we define @xmath95 and its value can be obtained for each @xmath96 by parallel transporting @xmath94 along some path from @xmath82 to @xmath97 in @xmath84 : [ transport ] ( x)= p\\ { _ p^x a^a_i t_a ds^i } _ 0 .",
    "the pair ( @xmath93 , @xmath71 ) thus constructed is obviously a solution of the vortex equations .",
    "therefore the space of solutions for the vortex eqs .",
    "( [ static ] ) is essentially parametrized by homomorphisms @xmath98 .",
    "each such homomorphism is then a vortex configuration .",
    "let us take the example of a single point - like vortex on the plane . the non - contractible loop @xmath16 that encircles the singularity has holonomy @xmath99 equal to the flux carried by the vortex .",
    "in trying to capture only topological information , one is not concerned with the position of the vortex , but only with its flux , characterized by some group element @xmath100 . in other words , the `` configuration space ''",
    "@xmath101 for the vortex is labeled by elements of @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the algebra @xmath102 of complex - valued functions on @xmath15 with pointwise multiplication plays the role of `` position observables '' .",
    "let us denote by @xmath103 , the characteristic function supported at @xmath100 .",
    "then [ dp ] p_h  p_h=_hhp_h .    in terms of homomorphisms",
    ", we have not yet exploited all the degrees of freedom the system has .",
    "indeed , we have that @xmath15 can act by conjugating all holonomies based at @xmath82 by an element of @xmath15 .",
    "hence , a flux @xmath104 transforms under @xmath15 as h h^-1 , [ gauge ] in other words , we have an action of @xmath15 by conjugation of the fluxes .",
    "we shall simply refer to this action as the @xmath15-transformations .",
    "the group elements @xmath105 can be regarded as operators , also denoted by @xmath106 , acting on the functions @xmath107 via ( [ gauge ] ) . in other words , [ dg ] hp_h^-1=p_h h^-1 .",
    "the multiplication of two @xmath15-transformations is the same as the group multiplication .",
    "therefore the algebra of such operators turns out to be the group algebra @xmath108 .    as for the physical interpretation of the @xmath15-tranformations",
    "we note that the mathematical action depicted in ( [ gauge ] ) is entirely equivalent , from a physical standpoint , to what occurs when one makes a vortex of flux @xmath104 encircle a source of flux @xmath106 at infinity .",
    "since such operation is non - local , one must conclude that the @xmath15-transformations can not be considered local in the theory , i.e. , can not be implemented by local operators .",
    "the field algebra is then the semi - direct product @xmath109 , the so - called drinfeld double .",
    "it has the structure of a quasi - triangular hopf algebra .",
    "the hopf structure @xcite means in particular the existence of a co - product , i.e , a map @xmath110 which is a homomorphism of algebras ( and with further properties to be discussed in section 4 ) . in @xcite the fluxes are seen as particles in @xmath1 and are then first quantized : the ( internal ) hilbert space @xmath111 is constructed , and the elements of the algebra @xmath112 act as operators on this hilbert space .",
    "@xmath111 decomposes into irreducible representations of @xmath112 , corresponding to the different particle sectors of the quantum theory .",
    "the existence of a co - product allows one to understand fusing processes between particles .",
    "the quasi - triangularity implies the existence of the @xmath113-matrix , @xmath114 , responsible for all braiding processes between particles . for further details",
    "see @xcite .",

    "second , a configuration for which the holonomy is trivial around some puncture is indistinguishable , from the standpoint of the low - energy theory , to another in which that particular puncture is absent .",
    "therefore the low - energy theory somehow actually allows for `` topology fluctuations '' of @xmath84 as long as we stay within its limits , and as far as `` creation and annihilation '' of punctures is concerned .    in order to determine the field algebra for a topological geon , we will try to follow a method similar to the one used for vortices in the plane , respecting carefully the differences between the two systems .",
    "we will first try to find the analogues of the `` position observables '' for a geon .",
    "now , @xmath84 is the plane with one or more handles , and for simplicity we shall assume throughout the that there are no vortices , i.e. , we work in the zero vortex number sector of the low - energy limit of the theory given by the lagrangian in ( [ higgs ] ) .",
    "this is in constrast with @xcite , where vortices are the central interest .",
    "there , the vortices determine the state of a handle , whereas in the present work all non - trivial configurations will be related solely to holonomies around and through the handles .",

    "instead , our formalism revealed what an observer , probing the topology of space by using only quantum operators and quantum states , would be able to see .",
    "the key point was that in resorting to a field theory to infer the underlying spatial topology , one could only take into account those operators which were compatible with the scale of observations , since no other operator would a have sensible physical meaning in the theory .",
    "the passage from a larger scale of observations to a smaller one was represented , on a more technical level , by selecting a subalgebra of the original algebra describing the system in the quantum theory .",
    "the quantum states of the system , which in the case of geons give a direct information on the spatial topology , could now decay into the vacuum , leading the would - be observer to conclude that a topology change has ocurred .",
    "there is another , perhaps more intuitive view of the sort of topology change we have envisaged in this paper . as pointed out in section [ s3 ] for the case of vortices , those classical configurations for which holonomies are trivial around some `` topological blob '' , be it a vortex or a geon , are indistinguishable from those in which this `` blob '' is absent , or `` vacuum '' configurations .",
    "if we view quantum states as wave functions , it is clear that their role is to assign a probability to each classical configuration .",
    "a quantum transition to states which are very sharply peaked , or localized at the aforementioned `` vacuum '' configurations will be interpreted by an observer as a quantum topology change .",
    "such states correspond to the vacuum states of section [ s5 ] .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to a simple theory , where complications arising from local degrees of freedom were absent ( the theory we considered is topological in the limit of very low energies ) , and we could concentrate on the topological aspects more unobstrusively .    of independent value is the algebra describing the topological geons .",
    "the finite group @xmath15 can be generalized to a lie group @xmath14 .",
    "of special interest is the case @xmath398 , which describes geons in the presence of gravity .",
    "a suitable generalization of our formalism promptly discloses a whole spectrum of geon types in quantum gravity , and many interesting properties of these entities can be explored , as for instance spin - statistics connection .",
