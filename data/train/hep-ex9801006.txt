    "the proton - antiproton annihilation occured .",
    "measurement of charged tracks was performed with two cylindrical proportional wire chambers , which could be replaced by a silicon micro strip detector , and a jet drift chamber with 23 sensitive wire layers .",
    "a barrel - shaped calorimeter consisting of 1380 csi(tl ) crystals with photodiode readout and coverig 94% of the solid angle 4@xmath4 detected photons from the decay of neutral mesons like @xmath5 and @xmath6 with a precision in the energy of 2.5%/@xmath7 .",
    "the assembly was embedded in a solenoid providing a homogeneous magnetic field of 1.5  t parallel to the incident antiproton beam .",
    "suitable channels to explore the scalar mesons are the three neutral pseudoscalar meson final states .",
    "the reaction proceeds in two steps : the scalar resonance is produced together with a recoil particle and in the second step decays into two pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "scalar mesons decaying into two pseudoscalar mesons are dominantely produced from @xmath8s@xmath2 initial state of the @xmath9 -system in liquid hydrogen .",
    "centrifugal barriers hindering the reaction are absent .",
    "a large sample of events triggered to include only neutral particles which decay into photons was accumulated .",
    "an amount of 712,000 @xmath10 , 198,000 @xmath11 and 977 @xmath12 events could be reconstructed . to extract the resonance content in these annihilation channels",
    "a partial wave analysis was performed using the k - matrix formalism and describing the final states simultaneously  @xcite . in this analysis model the decay from a proton - antiproton initial state into the three final state particles proceeds successively via intermediate two - body states with a certain spin parity @xmath13 .",
    "if the intermediate states are resonant they are parametrized by a mass pole and couplings to the two - body channels .",
    "a common feature of the all neutral final states mentioned is the isoscalar scalar resonance @xmath3 .",
    "it could be described with a common mass and couplings to @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the crystal barrel collaboration observes the @xmath3 also in the 5@xmath5 final state in @xmath9 annihilation at rest  @xcite .",
    "the selection of this 10 photon final state made use of the all - neutral data sample .",
    "the 4@xmath5 invariant mass shows after subtraction of the @xmath17 events a peak at a mass of 1450  mev .",
    "this structure strongly deviates from phase space distribution .",
    "the partial wave analysis explains it as @xmath3 decaying to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is a name for the low energy part of the @xmath14 s - wave ) with @xmath20 and either produced together with the 3@xmath5 resonance @xmath21 or produced together with @xmath22 and the low mass tail of a resonance above 1700  mev in the same s - wave .",

    "the @xmath3 is observed in the decay into @xmath23 by studying the final state @xmath24 of annihilation at rest  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 is fully reconstructed , one @xmath25 is missing and one @xmath25 undergoes a hadronic interaction in the csi(tl ) crystals with an average probability of 54% .",

    "at least two poles in a @xmath34 k - matrix are needed in the s - wave to arrive at a satisfactory description of the data .",
    "these belong to the i=0 resonances @xmath22 and @xmath3 .",
    "the result stays ambiguous since one also expects the presence of the @xmath35 resonance which was observed in its @xmath36 decay  @xcite .",
    "any contribution of the @xmath35 between 0% and 15% does only affect the @xmath29 s - wave but not the quality of the fit .    to resolve the isospin ambiguity the final state @xmath37 of @xmath9 annihilation at rest",
    "was selected  @xcite . in the reaction",
    "@xmath38 only the @xmath39 @xmath29 resonances are produced . by applying isospin symmetry",
    "one can calculate their contributions to the @xmath40 channel .",
    "the @xmath41 final state was reconstructed by requiring a missing @xmath25 and two charged particles , which are identified by @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "an amount of 11,373 events went into the dalitz plot displayed in fig .",

    "mass and width were determined as @xmath45  mev and @xmath46  mev , respectively .",
    "the comparison with the annihilation channel @xmath47 yields the relative ratio @xmath48 = @xmath49 which agrees well with the prediction from su(3 ) flavour symmetry assuming that this object is member of the scalar nonet . having determined its contribution the @xmath3 decay to @xmath29 can be fixed . the relation is shown in fig .",

    "the width @xmath56  mev of @xmath3 is relatively small in comparison to the other scalar mesons having @xmath57 greater than 250 mev .",

    "the strong coupling to @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 can be understood in terms of the decolorization mechanism : the constituent gluons couple to the glue - content of the decay mesons and are color - neutralized afterwards by the exchange of gluons  @xcite .",
    "the naive expectation of the flavour democratic decay of a glueball can be explained by the mixing with nearby @xmath58 meson states  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the strength of the mixing depends on the mass of the @xmath59-like state which therefore is predicted at higher mass . to explore the mass region above 1700  mev",
