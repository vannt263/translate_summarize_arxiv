    "an old problem in von neumann algebra theory is the question of whether each separable von neumann algebra @xmath1 is singly generated .",
    "a single generator @xmath18 leads to two self - adjoint generators @xmath19 and any pair @xmath20 of self - adjoint generators yields a single generator @xmath21 .",
    "thus the single generation problem has an equivalent formulation as the existence of two self - adjoint generators .",
    "earlier work in this area solved all cases except for the finite von neumann algebras , @xcite .",
    "here there has been progress in special situations , @xcite , but a general solution is still unavailable .",
    "recently junhao shen , @xcite , introduced a numerical invariant @xmath22 , and was able to show that single generation for @xmath23 factors was a consequence of @xmath24 .",
    "he proved that @xmath25 for various classes of @xmath26factors , giving a unified approach to the single generation of @xmath26factors with cartan masa , with property @xmath27 and those factorising as tensor products of @xmath26factors .",
    "his work settled some previously unknown cases as well as giving a unified approach to various situations that had been determined by diverse methods .",
    "it should be noted that 0 is the only value of shen s invariant that is currently known .",
    "if strictly positive values are possible , then corollary [ scaling.nonsingle ] guarantees examples of separable @xmath26factors which are not singly generated .    in this paper ,",
    "our purpose is to undertake a further investigation of this invariant , and to relate it to a quantity @xmath28 which counts the minimal number of generators for @xmath3",
    ". a related quantity @xmath29 counts the minimal number of self - adjoint generators , and there is a parallel invariant @xmath30 to @xmath31 which has a similar definition ( given below ) but which restricts attention to self - adjoint generating sets .",
    "the contents of the paper are as follows .",
    "the second section gives the definitions of @xmath22 and @xmath32 in terms of generating sets and finite decompositions of 1 as sums of orthogonal projections .",
    "this is a slightly different but equivalent formulation of the original one in @xcite .",
    "these are related by the inequalities @xmath33 , although it is shown subsequently that @xmath34 for all @xmath26factors @xmath3 .",
    "the main result of the third section is that the relation @xmath35 for @xmath26factors @xmath3 implies generation by @xmath6 self - adjoint elements .",
    "the case @xmath36 is of particular interest since single generation is then a consequence of @xmath37 .",

    "the subsequent section contains some consequences of the scaling formula , and also establishes it for the related invariant @xmath30 .",
    "this requires a more indirect argument since the method of passing between generating sets for @xmath3 and for @xmath41 does not preserve self - adjointness and so can not apply to @xmath50 although it is suitable for @xmath51 .",
    "the equality @xmath52 is also established in this section .",
    "the sixth section is concerned with finite index inclusions @xmath53 of @xmath26factors .",
    "the main results are that @xmath54 and that @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the basic construction and @xmath57 denotes the index @xmath58 $ ] . a standard result of subfactor theory is that @xmath3 is the basic construction @xmath59 for an index @xmath57 inclusion @xmath60 , so two of these basic constructions scale @xmath61 by @xmath62 .",
    "this suggests the formula @xmath63 , but this is still an open problem .",
    "section [ free ] concentrates on free group factors and their generalisations , the interpolated free group factors . for @xmath64 $ ]",
    ", the formula @xmath65 is established , where @xmath66 is a fixed constant in the interval @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "this leads to two possibilities , depending on the value of @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath68 , then @xmath69 is singly generated for all @xmath70 , while if @xmath71 , then the free group factors are pairwise non - isomorphic , being distinguished by the generator invariant .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of voiculescu s modified free entropy dimension @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a finite generating set for @xmath3 .",
    "a quantity @xmath74 is introduced in the second section on the way to defining @xmath31 .",
    "the main results of the last section are the inequalities @xmath75 for general finite generating sets , and the stronger form @xmath76 for generating sets of self - adjoint elements .",
