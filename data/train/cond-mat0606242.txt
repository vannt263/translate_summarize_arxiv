    "in the past decade , a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to understand the underlying physics that leads to a charge ordering in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the motivation was clearly due to the observation of a such ordering in doped nickelate  @xcite and cuprate  @xcite materials , some of which constitute materials that exhibit high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "one of the simplest models suitable to describe charge ordered phases in interacting electron systems is the falicov - kimball model ( fkm )  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was shown that already the simplest version of this model ( the spinless fkm ) exhibits an extremely rich spectrum of charge ordered solutions , including various types of periodic , phase - separated and striped phases  @xcite .",
    "however , the spinless version of the fkm , although non - trivial , is not able to account for all aspects of real experiments .",
    "for example , many experiments show that a charge superstructure is accompanied by a magnetic superstructure  @xcite . in order to describe both types of ordering in the unified picture",
    ", it was proposed  @xcite a simple model based on a generalization of the spin - one - half fkm with an anisotropic , spin - dependent local interaction that couples the localized and itinerant subsystems . the first systematic studies  @xcite clearly demonstrated strong cooperative effects of spin - dependent interaction on the ground states of the model and revealed various types of homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous ordering .",
    "it is naturally to expect , that the formation of new structures is accompanied by changes in magnetization , and therefore we would like to study the ground - state properties of the model in the external magnetic field .",
    "the motivation for our study was also the work by lemaski  @xcite , where similar studies were performed using the restricted phase diagram method for 12 periodic configurations of the spins .",
    "here we study the model exactly ( over the full set of spin configurations ) for clusters up to 36 lattice sites and approximately for larger clusters .",
    "+ our starting hamiltonian has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a spin projection in @xmath6 direction with values @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the creation and annihilation operators of the itinerant electrons in the @xmath1-band wannier state at site @xmath10 .",
    "+ the first term of ( 1 ) is the kinetic energy corresponding to quantum - mechanical hopping of the itinerant @xmath1-electrons between sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these intersite hopping transitions are described by the matrix elements @xmath12 , which are @xmath13 if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the nearest neighbors and zero otherwise ( in the following all parameters are measured in units of @xmath14 ) .",
    "the second term is anisotropic , spin - dependent local interaction of the ising type between the @xmath1-electrons and spins .",
    "the last two terms represent energies of @xmath1-electrons and spins in an external magnetic field .",
    "+ using the fact , that @xmath5 takes only two values @xmath7 the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "thus for a given spin distribution @xmath17 , the hamiltonian ( 2 ) is the second - quantized version of the single particle hamiltonian @xmath18 , so the investigation of the model ( 2 ) is reduced to the investigation of the spectrum of @xmath19 for different configurations of spins .",
    "this can be done exactly over the full set of spin configurations or approximately over a reduced set . in this paper",
    "we present a combination of both methods . for clusters up to @xmath20 lattice sites",
    "we use small - cluster exact - diagonalization calculations and for larger clusters we use the well - controlled numerical method described in detail in the papers  @xcite .",
    "in the present work we study the one ( @xmath21 ) and two ( @xmath22 ) dimensional analogue of the model for the spin interaction value @xmath23 and for a wide range of magnetic field @xmath2 ( from @xmath24 to @xmath25 with step 0.01 ) . to reveal the finite - size effects numerical calculations were done on different clusters .",
    "we have found , that the main features of the phase diagrams in the @xmath26 plane ( for @xmath21 as well as @xmath22 ) hold on all examined lattices and thus can be used satisfactorily to represent the behaviour of macroscopic systems .",
    "here we present the one dimensional results for @xmath27 , that represent the typical one - dimensional behaviour , while for @xmath22 the numerical results are presented for @xmath20 ( the largest cluster that we were able to consider exactly ) .",
    "+ let us start a discussion of the phase diagram with a description of configuration types that form its basic structure in one dimension .",
    "manifold phases entered into the phase diagrams are classified according to @xmath28 and @xmath29 : the fully polarized ( fp ) phase characterized by @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the partially polarized ( pp ) phases characterized by @xmath32 , @xmath33 and the non polarized ( np ) phases characterized by @xmath34 , @xmath35 . comparing these phase diagrams with ones obtained for @xmath24  @xcite",
    ", one can see rather different behaviours .",
    "indeed , while for @xmath24 the magnetic phase diagrams coincide practically over the whole range of model parameters , the non - zero @xmath2 destroys obviously this coincidence .",
    "now the phase diagrams coincide only at low @xmath1-electron concentrations where the ground state is the fp phase for both the @xmath1-electron as well as spin subsystems . but with increasing @xmath3",
    "the spin and @xmath1-electron systems are developed differently . for higher values of @xmath3",
    "the spin subsystem still prefers the fp state , contrary to the @xmath1-electron subsystem where the pp state is stabilized .",
    "a different behaviour is observed also for @xmath36 0 , where the spin subsystem prefers pp state , while the @xmath1-electron subsystem prefers the np state .",
    "besides these differences the phase diagrams of spin and @xmath1-electron subsystems exhibit one same characteristic and namely that very small changes of @xmath2 can produce large cooperative changes , indicating possible metamagnetic transitions . before discussing these transitions",
    "let us discuss the complete set of ground state configurations , that enter to the spin phase diagram .",
    "the complete set of ground - state configurations consists of only a few types , including 7 different np phases , 10 different pp phases and of course the fp phase . between them one can find different types of periodic or perturbed periodic and non - periodic configurations , but the most interesting examples represent np phases . in this case",
    "all configurations ( with the exception of @xmath37 ) have a central point symmetry .",
    "let us now turn on our attention to the problem of metamagnetic transitions . to reveal the structure of magnetization curves we have performed exhaustive studies of the model for two different @xmath1-electron concentrations @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "2 we summarize numerical results for both electron as well as spin subsystems . in the first case ( @xmath38 ) the spin magnetization curve consists of two significant stairs ( see fig .",
    "2a ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath1-electrons , see fig .",
    "it is very interesting , that the relative small changes of @xmath2 lead to the significant spin reorientation from the periodic arrangement @xmath44 ( @xmath40 ) to the fp state ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the similar situation holds also for @xmath39 , where the transition from the np phase to the fp phase realizes through the pp states ( fig .",
    "2c ) . in the spin magnetization curve",
    "we have observed four significant stairs ( @xmath45 0 , 1/4 , 1/3 and 1 ) corresponding to four different configuration types ( @xmath46_{l/8 } , w_{1/4}=[\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\uparrow\\downarrow]_{l/8 } , w_{1/3}=[\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow]_{l/3}$ ] and @xmath47 , where the lower index denotes the number of repetitions of the block [ ... ] ) .",
    "the same structure is observed also on the @xmath1-electron magnetization curve as illustrates fig .",
    "let us now briefly discuss the case @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "3 we present the phase diagrams of the model in the @xmath26 plane obtained by exact - diagonalization calculations for @xmath20 and @xmath23 . comparing these phase diagrams with their one - dimensional counterparts one can find obvious similarities . again",
    "the phase diagrams coincide only at very low @xmath1-electron concentrations where the ground state is the fp phase , while for increasing @xmath3 the spin ( @xmath1-electron ) subsystem prefers the fp ( pp ) state .",
    "the np ground states for non - zero @xmath2 are observed only on isolated lines ( points ) at @xmath3 : @xmath48 for spins and @xmath3= 2 , 10 , 18 , 26 and 36 for @xmath1-electrons .",
    "+ the two - dimensional results are of particular importance since they could shed light on the mechanism of two - dimensional charge and magnetic ordering in doped nickelate  @xcite and cuprate  @xcite materials . here",
    "we concern our attention on a description of basic types of magnetic ordering that exhibits the spin - one - half fkm with spin - dependent interaction between @xmath1-electrons and spins in the magnetic field @xmath2 for @xmath22 .",
    "analysing obtained numerical data , it was found that the set of ground - state configurations consists of only a few basic configuration types , listed in fig .",
    "+ with increasing @xmath3 one can see a general tendency of the system to change the ground state from the phase separation ( observed for small @xmath3 ) through special inhomogeneous axial stripes ( intermediate @xmath3 ) to the regular `` chessboard '' structure ( around @xmath49 ) . moreover , the unusual central point symmetry observed for np phases in @xmath21 case persists also for @xmath22 ( for all np states with the exception of @xmath50 and @xmath37 ) , of course now as a mirror symmetry .",
    "again , we have studied the magnetizations for spin as well as @xmath1-electron subsystems on clusters up to @xmath51 lattice sites .",
    "unfortunately , we were not able to obtain the definite results , due to finite - site effects .    in summary ,",
    "a combination of small - cluster exact diagonalization calculations and a well - controlled approximative method was used to study the ground - state phase diagrams of the generalized spin - one - half fkm with spin - dependent on - site interaction @xmath23 extended by magnetic field for one and two dimensional cases .",
    "for both cases it was found that the magnetic field stabilizes the fp ( for spins ) or pp / fp states ( for @xmath1-electrons ) , while the np states persist only for @xmath52 .",
    "although , the non - zero @xmath2 destroys the coincidence between the spin and @xmath1-electron subsystems ( observed for @xmath24 ) , the one common feature is evident , and namely , that the very small changes of @xmath2 can produce large cooperative changes in the ground state of the model .",
    "this observation was supported also by studies of magnetization curves , where we have observed strong changes from the periodic np / pp state to the fp state as well as with configuration type analysis , where we have identified phase separated , striped , periodic and non - periodic spin distributions .",
