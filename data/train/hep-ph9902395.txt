    "the principal aim of the @xmath10 physics experimental programs is to measure the angles ( denoted by @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath1 ) of the triangle representing the unitarity relation : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "the idea is to overdetermine the angles of this triangle and thus test the ckm paradigm of cp violation .",
    "methods to determine @xmath1 ( @xmath15 arg @xmath16 including the electroweak penguin ( ewp ) diagram contribution have been suggested @xcite . to ( over)determine @xmath1 to test the ckm theory of cp violation , we measure @xmath1 using different techniques .",
    "it is thus useful to have new methods to determine @xmath1 . with this motivation , in this letter",
    ", we give two new methods to determine @xmath1 using time _ integrated _",
    "rates for the decays @xmath2 , @xmath8 ( method 1 ) and @xmath17 ( method 2 ) . as in all the other methods mentioned above ,",
    "flavor @xmath0 symmetry is used in both the methods .",
    "we will write the decay amplitudes in terms of flavor @xmath0 invariant amplitudes @xcite .",
    "these are denoted by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 and correspond to the @xmath23 linearly independent ways of forming flavor @xmath0 singlets from the initial meson @xmath24 , the two final state mesons belonging to the flavor @xmath0 octet and the effective weak hamiltonian which transforms as a @xmath25 . @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the parts of these amplitudes generated by tree level and penguin operators respectively .",
    "these invariant amplitudes include soft final state rescattering effects .",
    "some of the methods to determine @xmath1 @xcite , including the ones which use the decays @xmath28 @xcite and the decay @xmath29 @xcite neglect rescattering effects .",
    "in particular , these methods assume that the decay amplitude @xmath30 has no weak phase @xmath31 from the tree level operators . in the language of the @xmath0 invariant amplitudes ,",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the annihilation amplitudes of @xmath24 is contracted directly with the hamiltonian . ]",
    "@xmath32 are suppressed by @xmath33 and a combination of the @xmath0 invariant amplitudes , @xmath34 is zero ( both of which are valid in the absence of significant rescattering effects ) .",
    "rescattering effects can enhance the annihilation contributions _ and _ lead to significant @xmath34 @xcite . in this letter , we neglect annihilation contributions but _ do not _ assume any relation between @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 or the other @xmath0 invariant amplitudes .",
    "thus , rescattering effcts are partly included .",
    "the decay amplitudes for @xmath38 can be written as @xcite @xmath39 here , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 , @xmath44 denote the penguin amplitudes due to quark @xmath45 running in the loop . using the unitarity of the ckm matrix , _",
    "@xmath46 , we get @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "a simliar notation is used for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "henceforth , we will write the decay amplitudes using this notation .    the decay amplitudes for @xmath52 are @xcite @xmath53 using eqns.([b0pik ] ) and ( [ b+pik ] ) , we get an expression for @xmath54 , the amplitude for @xmath55 , @xmath38 with final state @xmath56 , @xmath57 the decay amplitude for @xmath58 is @xmath59 the qcd penguin diagram ( which is @xmath60 ) does not contribute to this decay since this decay has the transition @xmath61 .",
    "so , @xmath62 is the ewp contribution .",
    "neubert , rosner @xcite showed that @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the ratio of wilson coefficients ( wc s ) of the ewp operators ( with quark @xmath45 running in the loop ) and the tree level operators in the effective hamiltonian so that @xmath65.\\ ] ] the top quark ewp diagram with @xmath66 exchange is enhanced by @xmath67 and so @xmath68 giving @xmath69,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 . since @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we get latexmath:[\\[- \\sqrt{2 } { \\cal a } ( b^+ \\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\pi^0 ) \\approx 8 \\ ; c_{15}^t    and setting the strong phase of @xmath37 to zero , _",
    "i.e. , _ the ewp contribution is @xmath74 and can thus be neglected in the decay amplitude @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath76 can be determined directly from the decay rate @xmath58 .",
    "similarly , the expression for @xmath54 ( eqn.([a3/2 ] ) ) simplifies to @xmath77 so that @xmath78 where @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 , _",
    "i.e. , _ in this case , due to the ckm factors , the ewp contribution @xmath81 _ is _ important .",
    "thus , knowing @xmath76 from the decay rate @xmath58 and @xmath1 , we can determine @xmath54 and conversely @xmath1 can be determined if the ( magnitude ) of @xmath54 is known using some other method and the decay rate @xmath7 is measured . in using this relation , it is crucial that the parameter @xmath79 is calculable .    in the analysis up to now , annihilation contributions are included .",
    "the decay amplitudes for @xmath2 , @xmath55 decays to @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be written as @xcite @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the amplitudes which contribute only to @xmath10 meson decays to a final state involving @xmath89 @xcite .",
    ", @xmath90 is similar to @xmath91 , @xmath92 ( eqn.([not ] ) ) . ]",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 are annihilation amplitudes .",
    "we assume that the mass eigenstates @xmath93 and @xmath94 are given by the the canonical mixing : @xmath95 this mixing is consistent with the present data @xcite .",
    "then , the decay amplitudes for @xmath55 , @xmath2 decays to @xmath93 and @xmath96 are @xmath97 @xmath98 from eqns.([b+pik ] ) , ( [ b+keta81 ] ) and ( [ etamix ] ) , we get the relation @xcite @xmath99    = 1    [ figbketa ]    as mentioned earlier , the magnitude of @xmath54 is known as a function of @xmath1 in terms of the @xmath7 decay rate ( eqn.([a3/2nr ] ) ) .",
    "this , for a given @xmath1 , we can construct the two triangles formed by @xmath38 , @xmath54 and @xmath52 , @xmath54 ( corresponding to eqns.([a3/2 ] ) and @xmath100 s @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively in fig.[figbketa ] ) and the quadrangle formed by @xmath52 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 corresponding to eqn.([b+pikketa ] ) ( @xmath105 of fig.[figbketa ] ) .",

    "thus , we know the phases ( in the convention where the phase of @xmath76 is zero ) of the decay amplitudes @xmath52 , @xmath110 , @xmath104 and @xmath111 as a function of @xmath1 form this construction ( the magnitudes are , of course , known from the measurement of the decay rates ) .    we have included the annihilation contributions up to now .",
    "if we _ neglect _",
    "the annihilation amplitudes , @xmath112 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , using eqns.([b0pik ] ) , ( [ b+keta ] ) and ( [ b0keta ] ) , we get the relations : @xmath113 @xmath114 thus , we can predict the decay amplitudes @xmath115 , @xmath116 as a function of @xmath1 since , as mentioned above , we know the magnitudes and phases ( the latter from fig.[figbketa ] ) of all the other decay amplitudes in eqns.([b+b0etakrel1 ] ) and ( [ b+b0etakrel2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the decay amplitude @xmath115 is shown as @xmath117 in fig.[figbketa ] .",
    "once the decay rate @xmath115 or @xmath116 is measured , @xmath1 can be determined .",
    "thus , @xmath1 can be determined ( up to a four - fold discrete ambiguity ) by the measurement of the decay rates for @xmath118 modes ",
    "@xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 ( or @xmath123 ) .",
    "this method is based on the method of gronau _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the annihilation amplitudes are neglected _ and _ the relation @xmath124 is assumed . in other words , rescattering effects",
    "are neglected so that the amplitude for the decay @xmath125 has no weak phase @xmath31 .",
    "we neglect the annihilation amplitudes , but do not assume any relation between the @xmath126 s .",
    "thus , we include partly the rescattering effects .",
    "the decay amplitudes for @xmath127 , @xmath89 are @xcite @xmath128 @xmath129 with the canonical mixing ( eqn.[etamix ] ) ) , we get @xmath130 @xmath131 .",
    "\\label{bseta2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] neglecting the annihilation ampltudes , @xmath112 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , from eqns.([b0pik ] ) , ( [ b+pik ] ) , ( [ bseta ] ) and ( [ bseta2 ] ) we get the relations @xcite : @xmath132",
    "@xmath133    = 1.25    [ figbspieta ]    from eqns.([bsb0b+rel ] ) and ( [ etaetaprime ] ) we see that the decay amplitudes @xmath38 , @xmath52 form the sides and @xmath134 ( or @xmath96 ) the diagonal of a quadrangle shown in fig.[figbspieta ] .",
    "thus , the measurement of these @xmath23 decay rates fixes this quadrangle s @xmath135 and @xmath136 can be on the same side of the common base @xmath137 in fig.[figbspieta ] . ]",
    "of which the other diagonal is @xmath54 ( see eqns.([a3/2 ] ) and fig.[figbspieta ] ) @xcite .",
    "knowing the magnitude of @xmath54 from fig.[figbspieta ] and the decay rate @xmath7 , we can determine @xmath1 from eqn.([a3/2nr ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath1 can be determined ( up to a two - fold discrete ambiguity ) by the measurement of the decay rates for @xmath138 modes ",
    "@xmath139 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath140 ( or @xmath141 ) . in the method of @xcite , measurement of the rates for the cp - conjugate processes of all the above modes",
    "is also required to determine @xmath1 .",
    "we comment on the accessibility of the various decay modes used in the two methods .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath55 decay modes should be accessible at the @xmath142 machines whereas the @xmath4 decay mode will only be accessible at a hadron machine . since the qcd penguin does not contribute to this @xmath143 decay , the decay rate is expected to be small .",
    "the measurements of the decay rates to cp eigenstate final states : @xmath4 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 require external tagging .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we have used flavor @xmath0 symmetry in both the methods . in the factorization approximation ,",
    "@xmath0 breaking in the tree level amplitudes can be incorporated by factors of @xmath146 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xmath147 .",
    "however , since some of the strong penguin operators are @xmath148 , in the penguin amplitudes , the @xmath0 breaking effects are difficult to estimate , but the breaking will still be less than @xmath149 . in method 2 , we use the decay mode @xmath150 which does not have the qcd penguin contribution , but does have the ewp contribution .",
    "the ewp operators @xmath151 have very small wc s whereas the ewp operators with significant wc s , @xmath152 , are fierz - equivalent to the tree level operators @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "so in the factorization approximation , the corrections due to @xmath0 breaking in relating the penguin amplitudes for @xmath150 to the ones for @xmath2 , @xmath154 are given by factors of @xmath155 .",
    "we have also assumed that the @xmath0 breaking in the strong phases is small .",
    "a possible justification is that at the energies of the final state particles @xmath156 , the phase shifts are not expected to be sensitive to the @xmath0 breaking given by , say , @xmath157 ( which is much smaller than the final state momenta ) .",
    "however , it is hard to quantify this effect .",
    "both the methods can be used with cp - conjugates of all the decay modes as well .",
    "we have neglected annihilation amplitudes : @xmath112 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the validity of this assumption can be checked by comparing the decay rates @xmath134 and @xmath158  these two decay amplitudes differ only in the annihilation contribution ( see eqn.([bseta2 ] ) ) . in the absence of significant annihilation contribution , the decay rate for @xmath158 should be twice that for @xmath134 .    in summary ,",
    "we have discussed two new methods ( based on flavor @xmath0 symmetry ) to determine the weak phase @xmath1 using the decays @xmath2 , @xmath159 ( @xmath94 ) and @xmath134 @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "these methods partly take into account rescattering effects .",
