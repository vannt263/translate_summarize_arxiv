    "studies of mesons and searches for glueballs , hybrids , and multiquark states have been active fields of research since the early days of elementary particle physics .",
    "however , our knowledge of baryon spectroscopy has been poor due to the complexity of the three quark system and the large number of states expected .",
    "as pointed out by n. isgur @xcite in 2000 , nucleons are the basic building blocks of our world and the simplest system in which the three colors of qcd neutralize into colorless objects and the essential non - abelian character of qcd is manifest , while baryons are sufficiently complex to reveal physics hidden from us in the mesons .",
    "the understanding of the internal quark - gluon structure of baryons is one of the most important tasks in both particle and nuclear physics , and the systematic study of baryon spectroscopy , including production and decay rates , will provide important information in understanding the nature of qcd in the confinement domain .    in recent years ,",
    "interest in baryon spectroscopy has revived . for heavy baryons containing a charm or bottom quark ,",
    "new exciting results have been obtained since the experimental evidence for the first charmed baryon @xmath9 was reported by bnl @xcite in 1975 in the reaction @xmath10 .",
    "many charmed baryons have been observed in recent years in cleo , the two b - factories , the fermilab photo - production experiment , focus , and selex @xcite . only a few baryons with beauty have been discovered so far .",
    "earlier results on beauty baryons were from cern isr and lep @xcite experiments , while new beauty baryons are from cdf and d0 at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "most information on light - quark baryons comes from @xmath11 or @xmath12 elastic or charge exchange scattering , but new results are being added from photo- and electro - production experiments at jlab and the elsa , graal , spring8 , and mami experiments , as well as @xmath0 and @xmath13 decays at bes .",
    "however , up to now , the available experimental information is still inadequate and our knowledge on @xmath3 resonances is poor . even for the well - established lowest excited states , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , _ etc . _ ,",
    "their properties , such as masses , widths , decay branching fractions , and spin - parity assignments , still have large experimental uncertainties @xcite .",
    "another outstanding problem is that , the quark model predicts a substantial number of @xmath3 states around 2.0 gev / c@xmath6 @xcite , but some of these , the ` missing ' @xmath3 states , have not been observed experimentally .",
    "@xmath0 decays provide a good laboratory for studying not only excited baryon states , but also excited hyperons , such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 states .",
    "all @xmath3 decay channels which are presently under investigation in photo- and electro - production experiments can also be studied in @xmath0 decays .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath19 and @xmath20 decays , the @xmath21 and @xmath22 systems are expected to be dominantly isospin 1/2 due to that the isospin conserving three - gluon annihilation of the constituent c - quarks dominates over the isospin violating decays via intermediate photon for the baronic final states .",
    "this makes the study of @xmath3 resonances from @xmath0 decays less complicated , compared with @xmath11 and @xmath23 experiments which have states that are a mixture of isospin 1/2 and 3/2 .",
    "@xmath3 production in @xmath24 was studied using a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) with @xmath25 besi events  @xcite .",
    "two @xmath3 resonances were observed with masses and widths of @xmath26 mev , @xmath27 mev and @xmath28mev , @xmath29 mev , and spin - parities favoring @xmath30 . in a recent analysis of @xmath31 @xcite ,",
    "a ` missing ' @xmath3 at around 2.0 gev / c@xmath6 named @xmath32 was observed , based on @xmath33 events collected with besii at the beijing electron positron collider ( bepc ) .",
    "the mass and width for this state are determined to be @xmath34 mev / c@xmath6 and @xmath35 mev / c@xmath6 , respectively , from a simple breit - wigner fit . in this paper , the results of a partial wave analysis of @xmath36 are presented , based on the same event sample .",
    "the upgraded beijing spectrometer detector , is a large solid - angle magnetic spectrometer which is described in detail in ref .",
    "the momenta of charged particles are determined by a 40-layer cylindrical main drift chamber(mdc ) which has a momentum resolution of @xmath37 ( p in gev / c ) .",
    "particle identification is accomplished by specific ionization ( @xmath38 ) measurements in the drift chamber and time - of - flight ( tof ) information in a barrel - like array of 48 scintillation counters .",
    "the @xmath38 resolution is @xmath39 ; the tof resolution for bhabha events is @xmath40 ps .",
    "a 12-radiation - length barrel shower counter ( bsc ) comprised of gas tubes interleaved with lead sheets is radially outside of the time - of - flight counters .",
    "the bsc measures the energy and direction of photons with resolutions of @xmath41 ( @xmath42 in gev ) , @xmath43 mrad , and @xmath44 cm .",
    "outside of the solenoidal coil , which provides a 0.4  tesla magnetic field over the tracking volume , is an iron flux return that is instrumented with three double layers of counters that identify muons of momenta greater than 0.5  gev / c .    in this analysis , a geant3-based monte carlo ( mc ) program , with detailed consideration of detector performance",
    "the consistency between data and mc has been carefully checked in many high - purity physics channels , and the agreement is reasonable .",
    "more details on this comparison can be found in ref .",
    "the decay @xmath45 with @xmath46 contains two charged tracks and two photons .",
    "the first level of event selection for @xmath47 candidate events requires two charged tracks with total charge zero .",
    "each charged track , reconstructed using mdc information , is required to be well fitted to a three - dimensional helix , be in the polar angle region @xmath48 , and have the point of closest approach of the track to the beam axis to be within 1.5 cm radially and within 15 cm from the center of the interaction region along the beam line .",
    "more than two photons per candidate event are allowed because of the possibility of fake photons coming from interactions of the charged tracks in the detector , from @xmath49 annihilation , or from electronic noise in the shower counter .",
    "a neutral cluster is considered to be a photon candidate when the energy deposited in the bsc is greater than 50  mev , the angle between the nearest charged tracks and the cluster is greater than 10@xmath50 , and the angle between the cluster development direction in the bsc and the photon emission direction is less than 23@xmath50 . because of the large number of fake photons from @xmath49 annihilation , we further require the angle between the @xmath49 and the nearest neutral cluster be greater than @xmath51 .",
    "figures  [ fig : bepc ]  ( a ) and ( b ) show the distributions of the angles @xmath52 and @xmath53 between the @xmath54 or @xmath49 and the nearest neutral cluster for @xmath45 mc simulation ; most of the fake photons from @xmath49 annihilation accumulate at small angles .         to identify the proton and antiproton , the combined tof and @xmath38 information is used . for each charged track in an event , the particle identification ( pid ) @xmath55 is determined using : @xmath56 where @xmath57 corresponds to the particle hypothesis .",
    "a charged track is identified as a proton if @xmath58 for the proton hypothesis is less than those for the @xmath59 or @xmath60 hypotheses . for",
    "the channel studied , one charged track must be identified as a proton and the other as an antiproton .",
    "the selected events are subjected to a 4-c kinematic fit under the @xmath61 hypothesis . when there are more than two photons in a candidate event , all combinations are tried , and the combination with the smallest 4-c fit @xmath62 is retained .    in order to reduce contamination from back - to - back decays , such as @xmath63 _ etc .",
    "_ , the angle between two charged tracks , @xmath64 , is required to be less than 175@xmath50 .",
