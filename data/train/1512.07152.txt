    "the study of test - mass with intrinsic angular momentum or spin and its dynamics in curved space - time , was very essential since the beginning of general relativity .",
    "there are two complimentary approaches to the subject .",
    "since the gravitating objects possess quasi - rigid rotation along with orbital motion , studies have aimed at keeping track of the centre of mass by using different supplementary conditions with in the mathisson - papapetrou model @xcite .    in practise , determining the overall motion of the body , by following a detailed microscopic description of a material body is often too complicated .",
    "therefore the spinning particle approximation , in contrast neglects the internal structure by assigning an overall position , momentum and spin to a test mass moving on a worldline .",
    "in recent papers @xcite we derived equations of motion for compact spinning bodies in curved space - time in an effective world - line formalism .",
    "the equations can be obtained either in a hamiltonian formulation or from local energy - momentum conservation . in the hamiltonian formulation ,",
    "the dynamical systems are specified by the following three sets of ingredients :      in the simplest case of a massive free spinning particle in the absence of stern - gerlach forces and external fields the equations read @xmath1 the solution of these equations is the worldline ( as shown in fig.1 ) along which the spin tensor is covariantly constant rather than a worldline followed by some preferred centre of mass , however chosen .",
    "+    r0.16        here @xmath2 is the mass of the spinning particle , @xmath3 is the proper time , and the proper velocity @xmath4 is the tangent vector ( blue arrows ) of this worldline ( thick , black line ) , which may differ from the proper velocity of any centre of mass ( dotted lines ) and the difference is quantified by the dipole vector @xmath5 ( green , double arrows ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the anti - symmetric spin tensor which unifies the internal angular momentum pseudo - vector @xmath8 and the mass dipole moment @xmath5 .",
    "both vectors are space - like : @xmath9 as required to match the number of independent components of @xmath7 .      in the phase - space formulation",
    "the equations of motion ( [ 2.1a ] ) can be derived from the free hamiltonian @xmath10 by applying the model - independent dirac - poisson brackets @xmath11 here the inverse metric @xmath12 , the connection @xmath13 and the riemann tensor @xmath14 appear as structure functions in the bracket algebra .",
    "this formalism is also convenient for deriving constants of motion , which commute with the hamiltonian in the sense of the brackets . for a test mass moving on spherically symmetric space - times , there",
    "exist conservation laws as implied by noether s theorem .",
    "the symmetries of the space - time manifest themselves as killing vectors .    here due to spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the conserved quantities implied by noether s theorem are linear combinations of momentum and spin components : @xmath15 such a constant exists if @xmath16 thus @xmath17 is a killing vector and @xmath18 is its anti - symmetrized gradient : @xmath19 in addition , for any space - time geometry there exist universal constants of motion : the particle s mass given by the hamiltonian constraint ; the total spin @xmath20 as a result of local lorentz invariance ; and the pseudo - scalar spin - dipole product is defined as @xmath21",
    "the schwarzschild metric is the unique , static and spherically symmetric vacuum solution , as implied by birkhoff s theorem .",
    "its standard line element in droste co - ordinates reads : @xmath22 as a result of the the time - translation symmetry there is a killing vector field corresponding to the particle energy @xmath23 the spherical symmetry implies three killing vector fields generating a conserved angular momentum 3-vector @xmath24 the invariance under rotations allows us to choose the direction of total angular momentum to be the @xmath25-direction , such that @xmath26 therefore we can express four spin - tensor components in terms of co - ordinates and velocities : @xmath27 the two remaining spin - tensor components @xmath28 and @xmath29 are related ( [ 2.3d ] ) to the constants of motion @xmath20 and @xmath30 and the orbital parameters .",
    "in addition , we have the hamiltonian constraint : @xmath31 @xmath32 the total angular momentum @xmath33 of spinless particles is strictly orbital , therefore they move in a plane perpendicular to the angular momentum . with our choice of the @xmath25-axis",
    "this is the equatorial place @xmath34 . for the spinning particles , as the precession of the spin",
    "is compensated by the precession of the orbital angular momentum and they are not necessarily aligned , the plane of the orbit can precess @xcite .",
    "to find the simplest orbit : circular , we consider the motion to be in the equatorial plane",
    ". then the planar motion @xcite requires alignment of the spin with the orbital angular momentum in the schwarzschild geometry . which implies , + @xmath35 as a result @xmath36 such orbits satisfy the conservation law @xmath37 for circular orbits we additionally impose @xmath38 and @xmath39 then the equations of motion ( [ 2.1a ] ) implies @xmath40 are constants .",
    "further , the symmetry of the circular orbit guarantees that @xmath41 are constant in time , and therefore @xmath42 indeed .",
    "since the radial acceleration is absent @xmath43 and using the hamiltonian constraint ( [ 4f ] ) , the equation of motion which describes the circular orbit in terms of constants @xmath44 is found to be @xmath45 ,   \\label{5d}\\ ] ] which can be solved for orbital frequency @xmath46 ( therefore @xmath47 ) . it can also be written equivalently in terms of other constants @xmath48 , by using the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath49 obtained by setting the condition : the rate of change of @xmath29 vanishes , as implied by circular orbits .",
    "finally the total spin for circular orbits written in terms of constants @xmath50 : @xmath51 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{\\left ( 1 - \\frac{2m}{r } \\right ) } \\left [ j - m r^2 u^{\\varphi } \\right]^2 .",
    "\\label{5e}\\ ] ]      r0.39        re - writing ( [ 5d ] ) with orbital angular momentum @xmath52 and spin parameter @xmath53 , in the form @xmath54 @xmath55 ,   \\label{4.1}\\ ] ] we derive the minimum of @xmath56 as a function of @xmath57 for fixed spin @xmath58 and the result if plotted in fig .",
    "it coincides with the @xmath0 in the absence of spin : @xmath59 when @xmath60 .",
    "we have established that the curve approximates the @xmath0 well in the domain of physical interest @xmath61 . beyond this limit",
    ", the back reaction of the spinning particle on the space - time geometry can no longer be neglected anyway .",
    "we have also presented the detailed analysis of @xmath0 from the arguments of stability criterion @xcite .",
    "we can extend our analysis by including a spin - spin interaction , with coupling constant @xmath62 : @xmath63 using this non - minimal hamiltonian in the brackets ( [ 2.2b ] ) , we generalize the equations of motion ( [ 2.1a ] ) and obtain the gravitational stern - gerlach force , coupling spin to the gradient of the curvature @xmath64 remarkably all the conservation laws established for the minimal hamiltonian holds true here as well .",
    "a covariant hamiltonian spin - dynamics in curved space - time is formulated without using any supplementary conditions like pirani , tulczyjew and so on . as a result",
    "the pirani vector @xmath65 is no longer zero in the theory .",
    "the advantage of this formalism is , that the closed set of model - independent poisson - dirac brackets can be used with different hamiltonians , using the minimal choice of hamiltonian we obtain the equations of motion by computing its bracket with this hamiltonian . the particle s motion along killing trajectories , like circular orbits have been studied .",
    "next the study has been extended with gravitational stern - gerlach interactions by introducing the non - minimal hamiltonian .",
    "i am grateful to my collaborators of this work , g. dambrosi and j. w. van holten .",
    "i thank the organisers of the fourteenth marcel grossmann meeting - mg14 , for giving me an opportunity to present this work .",
    "i also acknowledge nikhef for all the hospitality extended to me during this project ."
