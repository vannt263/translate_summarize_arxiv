    "<S> more recently , advances in microscopy have allowed their direct visualization . </S>",
    "<S> atomic force microscopy ( afm ) has enabled the 2d study of single dislocations @xcite while transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , which was initially limited to 2d projections of thin specimens , can now visualize strain fields in 3d with near atomic resolution @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> these investigations confirmed that dissolution and growth proceed by analogous mechanisms @xcite and also identified that crystallographic defects , and in particular screw dislocations , are of fundamental importance to crystal growth and dissolution processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be attributed to the fact that screw dislocations cause deformation ( and therefore strain ) of the adjacent crystal lattice , which in turn alters the activation barrier for growth and dissolution in the vicinity of the dislocation @xcite . a full picture of crystal growth and dissolution mechanisms </S>",

    "<S> +   + in this article , we demonstrate how bcdi @xcite can be used to study the role of dislocations in dictating the mechanism of growth and dissolution of calcite crystals . </S>",
    "<S> calcite was selected for study as it is one of the most - studied inorganic crystals , and the crystals readily grow to a few microns in size , with well - defined morphologies . </S>",
    "<S> bcdi is an imaging technique that uses coherent x - rays to image the density ( and morphology ) of a crystal , and importantly , the strain within it @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> illumination of a crystal that is smaller than the coherence volume of the beam generates a coherent x - ray diffraction ( cxd ) pattern due to scattering from all parts of the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> an image of the crystal morphology can then be generated from the cxd pattern , where the phase of the scattered wave is reconstructed using iterative phase retrieval algorithms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructed density is complex valued , with the amplitude containing information about the electron density , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> phase shifts in the reconstructed complex density arise from strain ( internal deformation ) in the crystal lattice . </S>",

    "<S> is obtained ( projected displacement ) and components of @xmath6 perpendicular to @xmath4 will not be observed . </S>",
    "<S> it is this sensitivity to deformations that makes bcdi ideal for studying defects within crystals . </S>",
    "<S> +   + calcite crystals were precipitated by placing 100 @xmath7l droplets of a solution containing cacl@xmath8 , urea and urease on hydroxyl terminated , self - assembled monolayers ( sams ) supported on gold thin films . </S>",
    "<S> caco@xmath0 precipitation then occurred on enzymatic hydrolysis of the urea to ammonium and carbonate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method was selected as it generated a high density of @xmath9104@xmath10 oriented calcite rhombohedra with average diameters of @xmath11 1.25 @xmath7 m @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bcdi experiments were then carried out at beamline i16 at diamond light source . </S>",
    "<S> individual calcite crystals below 2 @xmath7 m in size were illuminated with monochromatic , 8 kev x - rays , and diffraction was recorded at the @xmath9104@xmath10 bragg peak . </S>",
    "<S> 3d diffraction data sets ( supplementary information fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) were obtained by rocking an isolated calcite crystal through its bragg peak , and the same crystal was monitored while undergoing cycles of growth and dissolution . </S>",
    "<S> dissolution was achieved by depositing dilute acetic acid solution on the crystal , while growth was achieved by adding a drop of calcium bicarbonate solution . </S>",
    "<S> alignment of the crystal was maintained throughout , as the x - rays were nominally unfocussed and defined by slits with a square opening of 200 @xmath7 m placed 0.3 m before the sample . </S>",

    "<S> the initial crystal ( i ) is the expected rhombohedron , where this is consistent with scanning electron micrographs ( supplementary information fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . growth of this crystal ( i to ii ) leads to an increase in size and a smoothing of the faces exposed to the bulk solution , while the face in contact with the sam remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , two of the faces directed into the solution ( indicated with blue arrows ) grow more rapidly than the other three . </S>",
    "<S> this is immediately indicative of a non - uniform distribution of defects , as all faces of an entirely perfect rhombohedron would be expected to grow at the same rate . </S>",
    "<S> images of the corresponding projected displacements are shown in figure 1b , where this is mapped onto an iso - surface with red and blue representing lattice contraction or expansion respectively by half a lattice spacing . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the projected displacements before ( i ) and after ( ii ) crystal growth shows that these do not grow significantly with the crystal but remain maximal at the edges . this is indicative of the presence of active growth fronts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> +   + the dissolution steps ( fig . 1 , </S>",
    "<S> ii to iii and iii to iv ) show that the crystal faces retreat along all directions , but that this is more pronounced at certain sites ( indicated by red arrows ) . </S>",
    "<S> initial signs of changes in the crystal shape and the onset of etch - pit formation are visible after the first stage of dissolution ( iii ) , which leads to an increase in the specific surface area and roughness of the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the etch pits are also associated with higher levels of deformation / strain . </S>",
    "<S> that relatively little change occurs in the crystal face adjacent to the substrate is consistent with the intimate contact of the sam with this nucleation face . </S>",
    "<S> the second dissolution step ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( iii - iv ) and fig . 5 ( iii - iv ) ) results in a significant change in the crystal morphology , and the production of a porous isometric form @xcite that is quite distinct from the original shape and which can be attributed to the removal of defect outcrops at the crystal surface and the coinciding etch pits formed @xcite . looking in turn at the lattice deformation , </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that strain present at the crystal surface reduces with the increased dissolution . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the least stable ( more strained ) regions dissolve first , leaving behind a more stable core ( supplementary movies 1 - 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> +   + the projected displacement images also reveal a further intriguing feature , which is indicated by the grey arrows in fig . 1b , and which is present throughout the growth and dissolution of the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> this region possesses both a hollow core and a spiral phase , where this combination of features is characteristic of screw dislocations ; a number are highlighted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> dislocations are characterized by a burgers vector that measures the topological shift of the crystal along the dislocation line , where this is usually a lattice vector of the crystal @xcite . whenever there is a component of the burgers vector parallel to the dislocation line , it has a screw dislocation character causing the lattice to spiral around the dislocation ; in this way crystal growth ( and dissolution ) </S>",
    "<S> can be facilitated . </S>",
    "<S> confirmation that this feature indeed corresponds to a screw dislocation was obtained by recording the polar angle dependence of the displacement associated with the core ( indicated by the circle in figure 2a ) over the growth/ dissolution cycle of the crystal ( figure 3a ) . </S>",
    "<S> an approximately linear relationship was observed and is consistent with what is predicted by linear elasticity theory @xcite ( see supplementary information ) . to further confirm the nature of the identified dislocation </S>",
    "<S> , a comparison is provided between a simulated screw dislocation and simulated screw after bcdi processing . </S>",
    "<S> the model screw dislocation used in the simulation is shown at atomic resolution in figure 4a , with the resulting displacement of atoms from their ideal lattice positions given in figure 4c . </S>",
    "<S> the bcdi experiment processed simulated screw dislocation is shown in figures 4b and 4d ( see supplementary information for details ) . figures 4e and 4f provide a comparison of bcdi reconstructed displacement and simulated displacement , viewed along the dislocation line , and clearly show that the low density core and spiral displacement are well - preserved after bcdi processing . </S>",
    "<S> +   + further examination of regions that showed a spiral deformation and low - amplitude core enabled many additional dislocations to be identified within the imaged crystal ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> these have been rendered and are shown in figure 5 and supplementary movies 5 - 8 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial crystal ( i ) possesses several dislocations which are located relatively close to the crystal surface ( down to 200 nm ) and are found predominantly parallel to @xmath9104@xmath10 planes . </S>",
    "<S> these dislocations are mainly associated with the faces exposed to the bulk solution , and are visible throughout a single crystal growth and dissolution cycle ( steps i - iii ) , during which they ( ii ) increase and ( iii ) decrease in length . </S>",
    "<S> the reproducibility of locating the same dislocation across independently reconstructed data sets provides further credence to the recovered images . </S>",
    "<S> +   + dislocations are often found to occur in loops or pairs with opposite burgers vector , as this reduces the lattice potential energy and resulting long - range strain associated with these features . </S>",
    "<S> they also are stabilized near crystal surfaces , as found in this work , such that dislocation motion can transport material into and out of crystals from the growth solution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as intuitively expected , the most rapidly growing crystal faces were observed to have the highest number of surface dislocations . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of these defects within the crystal therefore plays a part in determining the morphology of the product crystal . </S>",
    "<S> considering the dissolution process , the locations of the dislocations coincide with the position of the etch pits that appear at the crystal surface during dissolution . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the developing pits follow the cores of the dislocations , where this effect can be attributed to a reduced activation barrier to dissolution due to stored strain energy in the defects14 . </S>",
    "<S> new dislocations could be identified during the dissolution ( iii to iv ) , and by the final stage ( iv ) many of the original dislocations had been annihilated . </S>",
    "<S> the loss of faceting and dislocations near the surface support the hypothesis that the least stable regions dissolve first , leaving behind a more stable core . </S>",
    "<S> +   + to determine the overall effect that the growth/ dissolution had on the strain and deformation of the crystal , the gradient of the displacement was calculated and its magnitude was plotted as a function of fractional size ( figure 3b and c ) . the magnitude of the gradient was calculated over successively larger shells and averaged over all directions and is plotted as a @xmath12 of deformation ( strain ) relative to the lattice constant for the 104 reflection ( see supplementary information for details ) for the directions parallel and perpendicular to the scattering vector ( which is approximately parallel with y ) . what is evident ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b and c ) is that the initial crystallite experiences an increasing strain from the center , outwards . </S>",
    "<S> this can be compared to a crystal formed after the first growth stage ( ii ) , which shows an overall flatter initial strain , and then increases more rapidly above a fractional size @xmath11 0.6 . </S>",
    "<S> the smoother transition and lower strain for the direction parallel suggest some relaxation of the crystal after the initial growth and can also be seen in the slices in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . these data are therefore consistent with the assertion that the effect of the surface only penetrates to a finite distance into a crystal . with the increased roughness and etch - pit formation that occurs in the first dissolution step ( iii ) , the overall strain is higher , demonstrating that these surface features affect the entire crystal , leading to an increase in overall deformation . </S>",
    "<S> after the final dissolution ( iv ) when the majority of surface dislocations have been removed , the strain becomes almost flat . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that surface effects are less pronounced , despite the increased relative surface area . </S>",
    "<S> +   + with its ability to simultaneously generate 3d images of the strain within a crystal and the gross crystal morphology , bcdi provides an extremely powerful way of visualizing the network of dislocations present within an individual crystal . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , bcdi can be performed in the absence of any sample preparation , which means that it can be used to elucidate the effects of dislocation networks on dynamic crystal behavior . using the example of crystal growth and dissolution , we have located dislocations within calcite single crystals , and then demonstrated that their distribution within the crystal dictates rapidly - growing directions . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , preferential dissolution and etch pit formation was also observed within the vicinity of the dislocations , which provides evidence that the stored energy within the dislocations affects the crystal response . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to view these fundamental processes using bcdi represents an important step forward in elucidating the nanoscale mechanisms underlying crystallization processes . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , bcdi also opens the door to 3d visualization of the role of dislocations in the response of a crystal to a huge range of experimental conditions , such as temperature changes or mechanical force . </S>"
