    "when driven far from thermal equilibrium , heterogeneous surface chemical reaction systems often show a variety of complex dissipative structures such as oscillations , turing patterns , spiral waves and turbulence@xcite . traditionally , these phenomena are mainly observed at macroscopic scales ranging from a few to several hundred micrometers , but recent studies showed that they are also present in nanoscale systems . at the present time",
    ", two different theoretical approaches are used to describe these nonlinear behaviors of surface reactions .",
    "mean field deterministic equations ( mdfe ) , like the reaction - diffusion equation , can provide good qualitative description of spatiotemporal dynamics@xcite .",
    "however , they are essentially phenomenological and neglect microscopic mechanisms such as lateral interactions between adsorbate molecules . in addition",
    ", mfde also ignores the molecular fluctuations which may play important roles in mesoscopic systems .",
    "another approach , microscopic lattice models , takes explicitly into account the adsorption , desorption , diffusion and reaction processes as random events , and one can use kinetic mente carlo ( kmc ) methods to yield detailed valuable information about the microscopic reaction properties@xcite .",
    "this microscopic method can account for the molecular interactions and fluctuations directly , however , memory and speed of available computers limit the maximal spatial size of the system , which renders the direct kmc simulation of nanoscale spatiotemporal structures and populations a difficult task . therefore , a promising way is to develop coarse - grained ( cg ) approaches , bridging the gap between those two , aiming at significantly reducing the degree of freedom to accelerate the simulation on large length scale while properly preserving the microscopic fluctuation information and correct dynamics .",
    "very recently , two kinds of cg methods based on lattice - gas model have been proposed .",
    "one is the continuum mesoscopic modeling devoloped by mikhailov et.al,@xcite which is derived from coarse - graining of the underlying microscopic master equation to get the functional fokker - planck equation and its corresponding stochastic partial differential equations ( spde ) .",
    "the other is a discrete cg approach proposed by vlachos and coworkers , which is a kind of cg - kmc algorithm by grouping the microscopic lattice sites into coarse cells and the cg system evolves by a sequence of cg events associated with the microscopic processes . by numerically solving the spde",
    ", mikhailov has successfully investigated the nucleation of single reactive adsorbate in one - dimension ( 1d ) and 2d systems @xcite , the formation of stationary microstructures for single species with attractive lateral interactions in a 2d system@xcite and the formation of traveling nanoscale structures in a model of two different species on 2d reaction surface @xcite .",
    "vlachos et.al had in - depthly investigated the validity of the cg - kmc approach in 1d conceptional systems with different potential form , the 1d ising system with spin exchange @xcite , prototype model of 1d diffusion through a membrane@xcite , steady pattern formation of simple reaction model on 2d surface@xcite , and so on .",
    "furthermore , the authors had also discussed the possibility for the extension of cg - kmc to complex lattices , multicomponent systems @xcite and heterogeneous plasma membranes @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that both cg methods enable dynamic simulations over large length and time scales and can accurately capture transient and equilibrium solutions as well as noise properties especially for long - ranged potentials .    in the present paper ,",
    "our mainly purpose is to find an effective cg - kmc method to investigate the nonlinear oscillation behaviors of surface chemical system which has already been developed into a field of very active research @xcite . here ,",
    "we adopt a 2d lattice - gas brusselator model , which is a typical oscillatory system with a nonlinear autocatalytic trimolecular reaction . to preserve the microscopic information correctly and accelerate the simulation at the same time , a cg - kmc algorithm by grouping @xmath3 microscopic sites into a cg cell",
    "is adopted .",
    "numerical results show that such a cg method is actually not a good approximation if the cg rates are obtained by a simple local mean field ( @xmath1-lmf ) approximation , due to the correlation among adjacent cells resulted from the trimolecular reaction can not be neglected .",
    "we thus proposed a @xmath2-lmf approach , which has properly accounted for the boundary corrections to the cg reaction rates .",
    "extensive numerical simulations show that the @xmath2-lmf method can reproduce quite well the oscillation behaviors , obtained from the kmc simulations on the microscopic lattice .",
    "to quantitatively investigate the accuracy of the cg methods , we introduce deviation coefficients @xmath4 for the oscillation amplitude and @xmath5 for the oscillation period between the cg - kmc and kmc , respectively .",
    "we find again that the @xmath2-lmf is remarkably better than @xmath1-lmf , and there is an intermediate cg cell size where the deviation reaches a nearly zero minimal level .",
    "we suggest that for the cg method to work , the cell size should lie in between the effective diffusion length and the minimal size required to sustain a well - defined temporal oscillation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we present the lattice brusselator model and describe the methods in detail , including the kmc and cg - kmc procedures .",
    "the numerical results are given in [ sec3 ] , where we mainly focus on the comparison between kmc and cg - kmc , by investigating the deviations in the oscillation amplitude and period as functions of the control parameter .",
    "we end by conclusions in [ sec4 ] .",
    "we consider a modified brusselator model on the 2d surface lattice as follows : @xmath6 herein , the reactions under consideration are assumed to run on a @xmath7 square lattice .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table ii , the cg processes as well as their corresponding cg rates are listed . note that b - lmf and s - lmf show difference only for the trimolecular reaction .",
    "according to these processes and rates , one can readily perform cg - kmc simulations . in the present paper",
    ", we also use null - event procedure as that for the kmc .",
    "the steps are outlined as follows ,    1 .",
    "choose a process similar to the first step used in the kmc , except that now @xmath12 and @xmath13 should be replaced by @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "repeat the above steps .    in the present study ,",
    "we start cg - kmc simulations from the same initial conditions as in the kmc . to be consistent with the kmc",
    ", the time increment should read @xmath36 for each trial .",
    "we compare the cg - kmc results with the kmc ones to check the validity of cg approaches .",
    "in our work , the main parameters used in simulations are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are control parameters . to compare the results of different methods ,",
    "we have generated time series @xmath43 or @xmath44 with enough length and calculated the oscillation amplitude @xmath45 and period @xmath46 as a function of the control parameters . in fig.(2a ) , the dependence of the oscillation range of @xmath47 on @xmath41 is shown , obtained by the mfde , cle and kmc with different diffusion constant @xmath48 . correspondingly the curves for the period @xmath46 are drawn in fig.(2b ) .",
    "the cle results are obtained by numerical simulation of eq.(10 ) and ( 11 ) with a time step @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "all the kmc results are also performed on a @xmath51 square lattice .",
    "the solid line obtained from mfde corresponds to the bifurcation diagram .",
    "a hopf bifurcation locates at @xmath52 , below which deterministic oscillation can be observed .",
    "several points can be addressed from this figure .",
    "first of all , cle and kmc show strong qualitative differences with the mfde : stochastic oscillations can be observed even outside the deterministic oscillatory region , here @xmath53 .",
    "this so - called noise induced oscillation phenomenon has gained great attention in recent years and may have important applications especially in circadian oscillation systems .",
    "secondly , the kmc results depend strongly on the diffusion constant @xmath48 . however , the results for @xmath54 and @xmath55 nearly collapse , indicating that the kmc results may converge in the limit of large @xmath48 . in this latter case",
    ", the mfde can reproduce the kmc results when the parameter lies deep inside the oscillatory region , see the range @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath48 is small , both mfde and cle show large discrepancies with the kmc results , no matter the range of the control parameter .",
    "finally , we would like to point out here that the cle can not reproduce the kmc results accurately even for large @xmath48 , although they share some qualitative features , e.g. , noise induced oscillation to the right side of the hopf point .",

    "the diffusion constant is @xmath54 and the other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig3],title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    in the following part , we mainly consider a system with size @xmath50 and diffusion constant @xmath54 .",
    "we have also performed some kmc simulations on larger systems , e.g. , @xmath59 , but the main conclusions are the same . since we are mainly interested in the validity of cg methods and extensive simulations are required to compare the results of different methods , we have fixed @xmath50 throughout the paper .",
    "cg - kmc simulations are performed according to the cg processes and rates listed in table ii . in fig.3 , the oscillation amplitude and period obtained by using s - lmf rates are shown , for different sizes of the cg cell .",
    "apparently , the s - lmf approach almost fails to reproduce the results of kmc , even qualitatively . for small @xmath58",
    ", the s - lmf totally loses the whole bifurcation features of the kmc dynamics .",
    "we show in fig.4 , however , that the b - lmf behaves much better than the s - lmf .",
    "firstly , the b - lmf can reproduce the global bifurcation feature quite well , even for small @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , for an intermediate value of @xmath58 , say , @xmath60 here , the b - lmf results show excellent consistent with the kmc results , in both the oscillation amplitude ( fig.4a ) and the period ( fig.4b ) .",
    "it seems that the b - lmf approach does catch some key factors during the cg procedure .",
    "-coverage and ( b ) period obtained from the @xmath2-lmf cg approach with different coarse size @xmath58 .",

    "[ fig4],title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    in fig.5 , we have plotted the dependence of the turnover frequency ( tof ) as a function of time for different coarse size @xmath58 obtained from the kmc , b - lmf and s - lmf .",
    "the tof is defined as the occurrence of the trimolecular reaction ( 5 ) per surface site per unit time .",
    "clearly , the b - lmf with @xmath60 matches the kmc quite well , while that with smaller or larger @xmath58 may capture some qualitative features of the tof but with apparent quantitative differences .",
    "the s - lmf , however , almost loses the temporal information associated with the tof .",
    "obtained from the kmc(solid - line ) , @xmath2-lmf(dash - line ) and @xmath1-lmf(dot - line ) , respectively .",
    "[ fig6 ] ]    to further demonstrate this quantitatively , we introduce a deviation coefficient for the oscillation range as follows . according to fig.3 and fig.4 ,",
    "each bifurcation diagram contains two branches , the upper branch and the lower one corresponding to the averaged maximum and minimum values of @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "as can be seen from the figures , both branches obtained from the cg - kmc methods show discrepancies with the kmc values .",
    "denote the upper branch value of @xmath47 , obtained by cg - kmc , at a certain control parameter @xmath41 by @xmath61 , and that obtained by kmc by @xmath62 , then @xmath63 measures the relative discrepancy of the upper branch , where @xmath64 is the number of control parameters used in the calculation .",
    "similarly , we can calculate the discrepancy of the lower branch @xmath65 . in the present work ,",
    "we have used @xmath66 points inside the range @xmath67 to obtain @xmath68 and @xmath65 . in fig.(6a ) , the dependence of @xmath69 on the size @xmath58 of cg - cell is shown , for the b - lmf with different diffusion constant @xmath48 and the s - lmf with @xmath54 . in fig.(6b ) , the curves for @xmath5 , the relative discrepancy in the period , are shown . clearly , the s - lmf method shows relatively large discrepancies , while the b - lmf works much better .",
    "the s - lmf is even worse than the mfde , shown by the dash lines in fig.6 for @xmath54 .",
    "one notes that both @xmath4 and @xmath5 exhibit a clear - cut minimum of about zero at @xmath60 for large @xmath48 when b - lmf is used .",
    "we also note that if @xmath48 is small , say @xmath70 here , the b - lmf also fails .",
    "this is not surprising because cg method which assumes well - mixing in a cg - cell should not work if diffusion is too slow .    in the above results",
    ", we see that the cg results for small @xmath58 do not match the results of kmc , even for the b - lmf .",
    "this is in contrast to the cg - kmc methods used by vlachos et.al to account for the dynamics of 2d lattice gas ising model .",
    "note that for the ising model , one mainly considered the equilibrium states .",
    "for the brusselator model considered here , however , we want to reproduce the temporal oscillation behavior . to reproduce the oscillation features on the whole surface , the temporal correlation of the time series",
    "must be properly maintained during the cg procedure .",
    "when we perform the cg procedure by dividing the lattice into cg cells , we are dealing with @xmath71 coupled cg oscillators , where @xmath72 is the size of the cg lattice .",
    "the coupling between these cg oscillators are realized by the diffusion and the boundary correlation considered in the b - lmf .",
    "if the cg cell is too small , however , the time - correlation inside each cell will be lost due to strong fluctuations and the time evolution of @xmath73 can not be viewed as an oscillation . as discussed by p.gaspard",
    ", a minimum number of well - mixed molecules is required to produce correlated oscillations , such that the auto - correlation time of the time series is not smaller than @xmath74@xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems that a seamless cg approach to reproduce temporal dissipative structures like chemical oscillation is a large challenge .",
    "on the other hand , for any cg method within lmf scheme to work well , the scale of a cg cell should not be larger than the diffusion length , as emphasized by mikhailov and others@xcite .",
    "the compromise between these two factors , i.e. , to keep time autocorrelation and to be smaller than the diffusion length , may be the reason of appearance of an optimal @xmath58 for the b - lmf approach .",
    "we note that this reasoning is not applicable to the s - lmf , for which the discrepancies monotonically decrease with increasing @xmath58 , since the s - lmf does not work for the present system .     and ( b ) oscillation period @xmath5 on the coarse cell size @xmath58 obtained from the @xmath1-lmf and @xmath2-lmf methods .",
    "parameter are the same as in fig . 2 and @xmath75 . [ fig5],title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]   and ( b ) oscillation period @xmath5 on the coarse cell size @xmath58 obtained from the @xmath1-lmf and @xmath2-lmf methods .",
    "parameter are the same as in fig . 2 and @xmath75 . [ fig5],title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]",
    "in summary , we have tried to apply a cg - kmc approach to simulate the oscillation behavior on the surface lattice - gas brusselator model . owing to",
    "the correlations between adjacent cells resulted from the nonlinear trimolecular reaction , the cg approach based on simple lmf approximation almost fails . by properly taking into account the boundary corrections ,",
    "we have introduced a so - called b - lmf cg - kmc approach , which can reproduce the microscopic kmc results quite well , given that the diffusion is not too slow and the cg cell size is optimally chosen .",
    "our work thus unravels the very role of reaction correlations which should be carefully considered in any cg approach and mesoscopic modeling for nonequilibrium spatiotemporal dynamics at nanoscales ."
