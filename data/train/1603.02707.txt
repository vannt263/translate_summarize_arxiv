    "lozenge tilings _ , which are tilings of domains on the regular triangular grid by rhombuses of three types ( see figures [ fig_hex ] , [ fig_trap ] , [ fig_covered_domains ] , [ fig_not_covered_domain ] , [ fig_gt_tiling ] ) , and which can be identified with dimers , discrete stepped surfaces , @xmath0 young diagrams , see e.g.  @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) . in more details , we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of _ gibbs measures _ on tilings , which means that tilings in each subdomain are always conditionally uniformly distributed given boundary conditions , i.e.  positions of lozenges surrounding this domain .",
    "there are several ways to produce such gibbs measures . from the point of view of statistical mechanics ,",
    "the most natural one is to fix a very large planar domain and consider the uniform measure on _ all _ ( finitely many ) lozenge tilings of this domain .",
    "asymptotic representation theory suggests two more ways , related to decompositions of tensor products of representations of classical lie groups and restrictions of characters of the infinite - dimensional counterparts of these groups , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite . finally , one can also _ grow _ tilings by means of interacting particle systems , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite .    the rigorous asymptotic results available in the literature for various random lozenge tilings models all share the same features .",
    "let us describe such features on the example of the uniformly random lozenge tilings of an @xmath1 hexagon as @xmath2 ( in such a way that @xmath3 and @xmath4 converge to constants ) , see figure [ fig_hex ] .",
    "note that such tilings can be linked both to decompositions of certain irreducible representations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and to growth models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the following asymptotic features of the tilings of hexagons are known :    * the random lozenge tilings exhibit the _ law of large numbers _",
    "section [ section_lln ] .",
    "one way to phrase it is that in each macroscopic sub - region of the hexagon the asymptotic proportions of three types of lozenges converge in probability to deterministic numbers , described by integrals over this sub - domain of three functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . in particular , outside the inscribed ellipse one observes the _ frozen region _ where asymptotically only one type of lozenges remains present , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the region where all three types of lozenges are asymptotically present is called _ liquid .",
    "_ * the global fluctuations of the _ height function _ of tiling ( see section [ section_lln ] for the detailed definition ) are asymptotically normal and can be described via the pullback of the gaussian free field with dirichlet boundary conditions , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "* locally , near each point inside the inscribed ellipse in the limit one observes a _ translation invariant ergodic gibbs measure _ on lozenge tilings of the plane .",
    "its  _ slope _ is determined by the law of large numbers ( such measure is unique for each slope , see @xcite , and its correlation functions admit known closed expressions , cf .  section [ section_main_proof ] ) , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . *",
    "the one  point fluctuations of the boundary of the frozen region at generic point after proper rescaling converge to the tracy ",
    "widom distribution @xmath8 , and multi  point fluctuations are described by the airy line ensemble , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "* at a point where the frozen boundary is tangent to a side of the hexagon , the fluctuations are described by the gue ",
    "corners process , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the _ universality belief _ predicts that all these features should be very robust along different models of lozenge tilings , and should not depend on details .",
    "it means , that while the limit shape ( i.e.  the asymptotic proportions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and the exact shape of the boundaries of the frozen regions differ from system to system , but they should always exist .",
    "the fluctuations of the height function should always be given by a pullback of the gaussian free field , and only the map with respect to which this pullback is taken , might change .",
    "bulk local limits should be always described by translation invariant gibbs measures and only the slope of such measure might vary from system to system .",
    "finally , the fluctuations of the boundaries of frozen regions should be always governed by the tracy ",
    "widom distribution , airy line ensemble and gue  corners process .    while this conjectural universality is confirmed by numerous examples , but by now only the law of large numbers has been proven in sufficient generality , cf.@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we address the third feature about local ( also called `` bulk '' ) scaling limits . in simple words , we show that whenever for a random lozenge tiling the law of large numbers holds , if the tiled domain has a straight boundary , then near this boundary the _ universality _ for the local limits is valid .",
    "we proceed to a more detailed formulation of our main result .",
    "consider a trapezoid drawn on the triangular grid as shown in figure [ fig_trap ] .",
    "such domain is parameterized by the length of the left vertical side @xmath9 and the width @xmath10 and we denote it @xmath11 .",
    "consider the set of all tilings of @xmath11 , in which we allow horizontal lozenges to _ stick out _ of the right boundary .",
    "the combinatorial constraints imply that there are precisely @xmath10 horizontal lozenges sticking out .",
    "let @xmath12 be a probability measure on tilings of @xmath11 which satisfies the _ gibbs property _ , which means that given the positions of the @xmath10 horizontal lozenges on the boundary the conditional distribution of the tilings becomes uniform .",
    "further , given a tiling @xmath13 of @xmath11 with coordinates of the sticking out horizontal lozenges @xmath14 , let @xmath15 be a probability measure encoding them .",
    "then the pushforward of @xmath12 with respect to the map @xmath16 is a _ random _",
    "probability measure @xmath17 .",
    "due to the gibbs property , @xmath12 is uniquely reconstructed by @xmath17 .    note that each tiling of @xmath11 can be viewed also as a tiling of @xmath18 , by adding a row of lozenges on top .",
    "for example , the tiling @xmath19 in the right panel of figure [ fig_trap ] is simultaneously a tiling of @xmath20 with added row on top . because of this correspondence , if we fix the coordinates of horizontal lozenges along the right boundary , then the exact value of @xmath9 in @xmath11 becomes not important ( as long as it is large enough ) . in the same way , in order to reconstruct a @xmath21random tiling by @xmath17 we actually do not need to know the value of @xmath9 .",
    "[ theorem_main_intro ] let @xmath22 , @xmath23 , be a sequence of trapezoids equipped with probability measures @xmath24 on their lozenge tilings .",

    "* the random probability measures @xmath27 converge ( weakly , in probability ) to a _ deterministic _",
    "probability measure @xmath28 .    then    1 .",
    "the @xmath24random lozenge tilings of @xmath22 exhibit the law of large numbers as @xmath26 : there are three deterministic densities @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , such that for any subdomain @xmath34 with smooth boundary , the normalized by @xmath10 ( random ) numbers of lozenges of types @xmath35 inside @xmath36 converge in probability to the vector @xmath37 2 .",

    ". of course , for the domains obtained from @xmath11 by rotating it by @xmath45 degrees , @xmath46 , the exact analogue of theorem [ theorem_main_intro ] is also valid .",
    "the conditions @xmath47 and @xmath48 of theorem [ theorem_main_intro ] are known to hold for many models of lozenge tilings , which implies that the local convergence to the translation invariant gibbs measures is true for them .",
    "let us provide some examples :    [ corollary_tilings ] let @xmath49 be any simply - connected polygonal domain on the triangular grid , and define @xmath50 , @xmath51 to be the domain obtained by multiplying all the side lengths of @xmath49 by @xmath52 .",
    "for any part of @xmath50 covered by a trapezoid ( three sides of such trapezoid should belong to the same lines as sides of @xmath50 , cf .",
    "figure [ fig_covered_domains ] ) , near any point in the liquid region in this part , the uniformly random lozenge tilings of @xmath50 converge locally to the ergodic translation  invariant gibbs measure of the corresponding slope .",
    "many polygonal domains can be _ completely covered _ by trapezoids , which implies the convergence to the ergodic translation ",
    "invariant gibbs measures _ everywhere _ in the liquid region , cf .",

    "the assumption of being simply  connected is also probably not essential , however , most law of large numbers type theorems in the literature stick to this assumption for simplicity , and so we have to use it here as well .",
    "there are examples of domains with holes for which the law of large numbers is explicitly known ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 9.2 ) ) , and for them corollary [ corollary_tilings ] holds .",
    "another example comes from the representation theory .",
    "recall that the irreducible representations of the @xmath10dimensional unitary group @xmath53 are parameterized by @xmath10tuples of integers @xmath54 called _ signatures _ , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to shift the coordinates by introducing strictly ordered coordinates @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "we denote the corresponding irreducible representation through @xmath57 .",
    "such representation has a distinguished _ gelfand  tsetlin basis",
    "_ , parameterized by the _",
    "tsetlin patterns _ , which are in bijection with lozenge tilings of trapezoidal domains as above . here",
    "the coordinates of the horizontal lozenges sticking out of the right boundary of the domain are precisely the label @xmath14 of the representation , see @xcite and also section [ section_gt_assy ] for the details .",
    "in particular , the dimension @xmath58 equals the total number of the tilings of trapezoidal domain with fixed @xmath10 lozenges along the right boundary .",
    "if we take any _ reducible _ ( finite  dimensional ) representation @xmath59 of @xmath53 , then we can decompose it into irreducible components @xmath60 and further consider the gelfand ",
    "tsetlin basis in each of them .",
    "recalling the bijection with tilings , we thus determine for each lozenge tiling of trapezoidal domain a non - negative number , which is equal to @xmath61 with @xmath62 encoding the horizontal lozenges along the right vertical boundary of the domain .",
    "all these numbers sum up to @xmath63 , so that after dividing by @xmath63 they define a probability measure @xmath64 on lozenge tilings .",
    "varying @xmath59 in this construction one arrives at several intriguing probability distributions .    the first example is given by the tensor product of two irreducible representations .",
    "[ corollary_tensor_products ] let @xmath65 , @xmath66 be two sequences of signatures ( in the notation with strictly increasing coordinates ) such that    * the numbers @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 are uniformly bounded .",
    "* there exist two monotonous functions @xmath70 , @xmath71 with finitely many points of discontinuity and such that @xmath72    consider the _ tensor product _ @xmath73 and the corresponding measure on lozenge tilings @xmath74 .",
    "then the conclusion of theorem [ theorem_main_intro ] is valid for @xmath74 as @xmath26 .",
    "the proof of corollary [ corollary_tensor_products ] is a combination of theorem [ theorem_main_intro ] with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) describing the law of large numbers for the tensor products .",
    "we remark that since theorem [ theorem_main_intro ] is restricted to @xmath32 , we do not get any information about @xmath75 , i.e.  the behavior of the lozenges at the right boundary of the domain .",
    "_ conjecturally _ this behavior should be similar , cf .",
    "@xcite for the recent results in this direction for sums of random matrices , which are continuous analogues of tensor products ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.3 ) ) .",
    "another celebrated representation of @xmath53 is @xmath76 , which was intensively studied in the context of the _ schur  weyl duality _ , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ corollary_schur - weyl ] consider the representation of @xmath53 in @xmath76 by natural action in each component of the tensor product .",

    "* theorem 5.1 )    corollaries [ corollary_tilings ] , [ corollary_tensor_products ] , [ corollary_schur - weyl ] do no exhaust the list of possible applications of theorem [ theorem_main_intro ] and we refer e.g.to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for some further examples of the situations where this theorem holds .",
    "further , theorem [ theorem_main_intro ] also has consequences for _ domino _ tilings on square grid , as in @xcite . in more details",
    ", it implies that in the particle process corresponding to the rectangular parts of domains tiled with dominos , the 1d bulk scaling limit along a section is universally governed by the discrete sine process , see section [ section_main_proof ] for the definition of the discrete sine process and @xcite for more details on rectangular domains and corresponding particle configurations .      one way to interpret theorem [ theorem_main_intro ]",
    "is that straight boundaries lead to a _ smoothing effect_. indeed , we do not know much about the local structure of random measures @xmath27 , and it can be anything , yet as soon as we move macroscopic distance towards the straight boundary , the local measures become universal .",
    "this interpretation can be put into a wider context by observing that the stochastic process of @xmath82 horizontal lozenges on @xmath83th ( from the right ) vertical line of a trapezoid @xmath11 is a markov chain in time variable @xmath84 , as follows from the gibbs property .",
    "therefore , we see that this markov chain has a _ homogenization _ property , i.e.  its local statistics become universal . in a parallel work",
    "@xcite we study a similar homogenization for the families of non - intersecting paths on very short time scales .    in the continuous",
    "setting there is a close analogy with the homogenization properties of _ dyson brownian motion_. such property was first observed in @xcite , and used there for proving the universality of the local statistics for certain ensembles of wigner random matrices .",
    "more recently , such homogenization was developed much further and has led to many exciting universality results , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is natural to ask whether an analogue of theorem [ theorem_main_intro ] can hold for other conjectural universal features of the lozenge tilings , such as the fluctuations of the frozen boundary or global fluctuations of the height function .",
    "regrettably , the answer is _ no _ , the knowledge of the law of large numbers at the right boundary of the trapezoid domain is not enough for proving other universal features . a simple way to see that is to take a bernoully random variable @xmath85 and to add @xmath86 to the coordinates of the lozenges at the right boundary .",
    "this addition clearly does not change the law of large numbers ( the assumption of theorem [ theorem_main_intro ] ) , yet it will lead to the same shift everywhere in the tiling , and therefore will influence all the conjectural limiting behaviors , _ except _ for the local bulk limits that we study here .",
    "we also refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.9 ) for a related discussion .",
    "the proof of theorem [ theorem_main_intro ] is based on several ingredients .",
    "the first one is the double contour integral expression of @xcite for the correlation kernel of the determinantal point process describing the uniformly random lozenge tilings of trapezoids with _",
    "fixed _ positions of horizontal lozenges on the right boundary .",
    "our asymptotic analysis of this kernel reveals a new fact : the bulk asymptotic behavior depends only on the global scale law of large numbers for the right boundary .",
    "this paves a way to pass from fixed to random horizontal lozenges on the right boundary .",
    "we also need to make a link between the slope of the local limiting gibbs measure and the slope in the global law of large numbers , for which we make use of the description of @xcite of the limit shape through the quantization of the voiculescu @xmath87transform .",
    "the author would like to thank alexei borodin , alexey bufetov and leonid petrov for helpful discussion .",
    "this work was partially supported by the nsf grant dms-1407562 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath23 let @xmath88 be an @xmath10 tuple of integers .",
    "a _ gelfand  tsetlin pattern _ with top row @xmath89 is an array of @xmath90 integers @xmath91 , @xmath92 , which satisfy the interlacing condition @xmath93 and the top row condition @xmath94 , @xmath56 .",

    "we adapt important ideas from @xcite ; yet the results of that article are not enough for our purposes , so we need to generalize them and supplement with new considerations .    the following theorem of @xcite is our starting point , see also @xcite .",

    "the content of this section is the asymptotic analysis of the correlation kernel .",
    "although we use a somewhat standard steepest descent approach to such analysis ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but the technical details are delicate , as we need to deal with arbitrary @xmath10tuples @xmath89 .",
    "we start by rewriting the integrand in the double integral of as @xmath107 with @xmath108 let us analyze the zeros of the derivative of @xmath109 , i.e.  the solutions to @xmath110    [ lemma_number_of_roots ] the equation has either @xmath111 or @xmath112 non - real roots . in the latter case the non - real roots are complex conjugate to each other .",
