    "we then set out to place this `` forgotten '' population in the context of current spectroscopic categories .",
    "we show that the majority of these sources look like low - luminosity agn ( a.k.a .",

    "( 2006 ) classification scheme.,scaledwidth=54.0% ]    in an era where surveys flourish , and this very volume is a testimony of this trend , galaxies are often tagged as `` starburst '' or `` active '' on the basis of relatively little data .",
    "even worse , in many cases the data is not enough to warrant a convincing classification , and such objects are usually set aside .    in the case of the sdss , one has to make do with optical spectra , classifying galaxies on the basis of their location in diagnostic diagrams such as the classical [ oiii]/h@xmath4 [ nii]/h@xmath2 bpt diagram .",
    "the sdss is an exquisite data set , but an awful lot of its galaxies do not have enough @xmath5 in their emission lines to allow a reliable classification . to illustrate the size of this problem , we select galaxies where both h@xmath2 and [ nii]@xmath6 are detected with @xmath3 . of this population of emission line galaxies , about 1/5 do not have [ oiii]@xmath7 and/or h@xmath8 detected with the same level of confidence , such that a rigorous bpt classification is not possible",

    "an unorthodox but statistically valid way to investigate the nature of these weak line galaxies ( wlgs ) is to plot them in the bpt diagram irrespective of the @xmath5 of their emission lines .",

    "[ fig : sfhs_on_bpt]a , but with even less sf in the recent past . star - birth , therefore , can not be responsible for any significant part of the ionizing radiation field in liners .",
    "but what about `` _ star - retirement _ '' ?",
    "trincheri & di serego alighieri ( 1991 ) and later binette et al.(1994 ) proposed that post - agb stars and white dwarfs could be responsible for the gas ionization in elliptical galaxies .",
    "stasiska et al .  (",

    "the plot shows that most wlgs are consistent with the retired galaxy model to within a factor of 3 .",
    "most strong line galaxies , on the other hand , require far more ionizing photons than old stars can provide .",

    "this is not to say that they do not contain a massive black hole , but until the black hole is proven to be active by means of independent data , they should not be included in any census of actively accreting black - holes ."
