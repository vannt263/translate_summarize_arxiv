    "wide varieties  of magnetic ground structures are manifested in @xmath0ni@xmath3b@xmath1c  series ( see e.g. refs.@xcite and tab.i ) : members with @xmath18ho , dy , nd , pr adopt commensurate antiferromagnetic ( af ) arrangements while those with @xmath18tm , er , tb , gd , assume squared - up spin - density wave ( sdw ) states .",
    "these ground structures are stabilized by a  fine balance of exchange , crystalline electric field ( cef ) , and magnetoelastic forces . under magnetic field or temperature variation ,",
    "most of these structures undergo a cascade of phase transformations , yielding rich varieties of field - temperature ( @xmath19 ) phase diagrams ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , most of the zero - field magnetic states of @xmath0=tm , er , ho , dy coexist with superconductivity , presenting model compounds wherein the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism can be investigated .",
    "such investigations revealed that the superconductivity , though much influenced by , has a very weak influence on the prevailing magnetic order:@xcite the energy gain due to the onset of magnetic order dominates by two order of magnitudes over that due to the onset of superconductivity .",
    "the zero - field part of the @xmath19 phase diagram of honi@xmath1b@xmath1c is particularly interesting : superconductivity sets - in at @xmath20 k. just below this point , an incommensurate spiral state , @xmath21.92@xmath22 , develops ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , at @xmath236.3 k , an additional modulated state with @xmath240.55@xmath25 emerges and around 5 k a deep minimum in @xmath26 develops.@xcite at @xmath275 k , an orthorhombic lattice distortion @xcite sets - in and , concomitantly , both the spiral and the a - axis modulated states are replaced by a commensurate af structure which coexists with superconductivity down to the lowest measurable temperatures .",
    "generalized susceptibility calculation @xcite related these modulated state to maxima in the exchange coupling transform,@xmath28 .    remarkably , the magnetic ground structures of the heavy and magnetic @xmath0ni@xmath1b@xmath1c compounds ( see tab.i ) are particularly simple : in spite of the manifestation of an orthorhombic distortion and a liquid - helium - temperature magnetic modulation , their ground structures are either an equal - amplitude , af - type squared - up state ( as in @xmath18tm , er , tb , gd ) or an equal - amplitude , colinear , commensurate af state ( as in @xmath18ho , dy ) . then ,  it is of interest to investigate whether the low - temperature thermodynamics of these @xmath0ni@xmath1b@xmath1c can be described in terms of  small - amplitude spin - wave excitations and , in addition , to elucidate the character and dimensionality of  these excitations .",
    "these magnetic excitations can be probed by various techniques , among which is the magnetic specific heat .",
    "we carried out extensive zero - field specific heat measurements on five single crystals @xmath0ni@xmath1b@xmath1c",
    "( @xmath0= er , ho , dy , tb , gd ) covering at least the range @xmath29 k@xmath30 these specific heats , together with  that of tmni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( ref.@xcite ) , reveal a diversified and wide varieties of thermal evolutions .",
    "none the less , based on a phenomenological model , all of the specific heat curves can be systematized in terms of only two parameters , namely an effective exchange coupling and a magnetic anisotropy interaction .",
    "the format of this paper is as follows : in sec.ii , we derive an approximate , but of wide applicability , expression for the magnon specific heat . experimental techniques and procedures",
    "are described in sec.iii .",
    "results and their analysis are described in sec.iv and discussed in sec.v .",
    "the  magnetic structures of @xmath0ni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( @xmath0=tm - gd ) can be visualized as magnetic layers that are stacked along the c - axis.@xcite the most  dominant interactions are the rkky and anisotropic couplings .",
    "the former can be approximated by effective isotropic couplings while the latter ( a combination of  dominant cef and weaker dipolar and anisotropic exchange forces ) by an easy - axis anisotropy field @xmath31:@xcite this @xmath31 representation is convenient for spin - wave calculation and is valid for the low - temperature orthorhombic - distorted equal - amplitude collinear af or squared - up phases of borocarbides ( see sec.v ) .",
    "considering the above mentioned magnetic arrangement and the crystal symmetry , the magnetic couplings can be conveniently divided into two classes : @xmath32 that couples moments @xmath33 and @xmath34 within the same layer ( denoted as @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 that couples moments from different layers . then at zero external field , the following hamiltonian is expected to capture most of their low - temperature  properties : @xmath38 the first and second sum represent , respectively , interactions within the same layer and among different layers .",
    "the last two terms represent the anisotropic interactions . by standard spin - wave analysis",
    ", we obtained the following dispersion relation : @xmath39   ^{2}-\\left [   sj_{\\vert}(k)\\right ]   ^{2 } } \\label{dispersion}%\\ ] ] where @xmath40 @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) represents the fourier - transform parallel ( perpendicular ) to the c - axis .",
    "the energy gap , @xmath43 is : @xmath44 which defines an af resonance frequency similar to the uniform mode of ordinary afs.@xcite evidently , ( i ) @xmath4 is zero whenever there is no anisotropy and ( ii ) @xmath4 does not depend on the type nor the strength of the intralayer coupling .    for evaluating the magnon specific heat ( or other thermodynamical quantities ) , an explicit expression of @xmath45",
    "is required . in the absence of  such an expression and for low - temerpature range , it is a common practice to assume a long - wave limit . here , we restricted the expansion of  @xmath45 to the nearest neighbors only , leading to : @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 for weak orthorhombic distortion ) and @xmath49 are functions of the exchange couplings and geometrical factors ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 are unit - cell parameters):@xmath52 then , the zero - field magnon specific heat is ( rewritten so as to conform with the notation of ref.@xcite ) : @xmath53   \\label{cm - bessel}%\\ ] ] where @xmath54 represents the modified bessel function and @xmath55{3^{\\frac{3}{2}}2(c_{x}% c_{y}c_{z})^{\\frac{1}{2}}/(a^{2}c ) } \\label{theta}%\\ ] ] is a characteristic temperature , based on which @xmath56 can be defined as being an effective exchange interaction that couples the magnetic moment to its @xmath57 nearest neighbors .",

    ".    for @xmath58 , eq.[cm - bessel ] reduces to the exponential form : @xmath59 while for isotropic compounds or @xmath60 , it reduces to the high - temperature limit : @xcite @xmath61 in this case , eq.[theta ]  highlight the useful definition of @xmath62 .",
    "a long - wave dispersion relation for an isotropic quasi-__2__@xmath63 case can be derived from eq.[dispersion - quadratic ] , if we set @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 : @xmath67 then , to lower order in @xmath68 , one obtains @xmath69 which reproduces the leading linear - in-@xmath70 term in the expression reported by movshovich et al  @xcite who ( starting from a quadratic dispersion relation and including correction for the 2d and the magnon - magnon interaction ) obtained for the range@xmath71:@xmath72    it is worth remarking that eqs.[h]-[dispersion - quadratic],[cm - bessel ] are of a more wide applicability than our above analysis might have suggested . furthermore , depending on only @xmath5 and @xmath4 , a variety of expressions for the magnetic specific heat can be derived ; each admitting different limits for its thermal evolution depending on the relations among @xmath70 and @xmath4 ( compare eq.[cm - bessel ] with the limit eqs.[cm - af - lowt],[cm - af - hight],[cm-2d ] ) .",
    "based on such a scheme , one is capable of rationalizing the vast varieties of  the  low - temperature thermal evolution of thermodynamical quantities ( such as @xmath73 ) encountered in these ( and any series similar to ) borocarbides .",
    "it is reminded that this analysis is not adequate for the description of the contribution of the modulated state since the involved ordered components do not have equal magnitudes .  finally , the above zero - field treatment",
    "is obviously not appropriate for the description of the field - induced metamagnetic phases .",
    "single crystals of @xmath0ni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( @xmath0=er - gd ) were grown by floating zone method.@xcite physical characterization were carried out utilizing a dc magnetometer [ @xmath74@xmath7550 koe , 2 k @xmath75@xmath70@xmath7520 k ] , a mutual - induction ac - susceptometer [ @xmath76=250 - 500 hz , @xmath771 oe , 30 mk @xmath75@xmath70@xmath7520 k ] , and a dc resistivity set - up [ @xmath74@xmath7550 koe , 2 k @xmath75@xmath70@xmath7520 k ] . structural , magnetic and transport characterizations are in agreement with published results .",
    "the temperature - dependent specific heat was measured on a semi - adiabatic calorimeter [ 80 mk @xmath75@xmath70@xmath7525 k , precision better than 4% ] .",
    "the total specific heat  curves measured above 2 k are in agreement with the reported data.@xcite however , we observed some discrepancy between the absolute values of @xmath73 of single crystal and polycrystalline samples : though both specific heats were found to be given by approximately the same functional form , the absolute values of the fit parameters ( @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) differ by as much as 40% .    for each compound ,  the total specific heat , @xmath78 , was analyzed as a sum of an electronic @xmath79 ( @xmath80 when superconductivity is to be emphasized ) , a debye @xmath81 @xmath82 , a nuclear @xmath83 , and a magnetic contribution @xmath84 from the only magnetically active @xmath0-sublattice . at temperatures of interest , @xmath79 and @xmath81",

    "consequently , even if @xmath79 and @xmath81 are taken as the bare values of yni@xmath1b@xmath1c , @xmath73 would not be noticeably modified , ensuring that our conclusions would not be influenced .",
    "@xmath93 of @xmath0ni@xmath1b@xmath1c , when available , is of  dominant importance only at very low temperatures and was evaluated by least - square fit using the appropriate hyperfine hamiltonian ; the obtained parameters ( shown in tab.ii )  compare favorably with those of the corresponding @xmath0-metal @xcite and @xmath0co@xmath1b@xmath1c isomorphs.@xcite",
    "from the general feature of @xmath73 curves ( figs.1 - 3,5 - 6 ) , one distinguishes four temperature regions : ( i ) a paramagnetic region , @xmath94 , wherein @xmath73 is predominantly due to a change in the population of the cef levels , ( ii ) a critical region , @xmath95 , wherein @xmath73 is related to the critical phenomena , ( iii ) an intermediate region wherein @xmath73 reflects the magnetic character of the spiral / modulated states , and ( iv ) the low - temperature af / squared - up states , of prime interest to this work , wherein the measured @xmath73 is to be confronted with eqs.[cm - bessel],[cm-2d ] and therefrom @xmath96 and @xmath4 are to be extracted .",
    "before we discuss the features of @xmath73 for each compound , a word of caution is in order : just as in the case of @xmath0-metals,@xcite the propagation of errors due to successive subtraction of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath93 would eventually influence the absolute value of @xmath73 .      below @xmath99 , the zero - field magnetic structure @xcite  is a transverse sine - modulated type with @xmath100 that changes from 0.551@xmath25 at @xmath99 to 0.550@xmath25 at @xmath101 , where a spin reorientation process sets - in . below @xmath101",

    "@xcite the thermal evolution of @xmath73 within the amplitude - modulated state is distinctly different from that within the equal - amplitude , low - temperature state ( see below ) . as mentioned above , within the modulated region the linearized spin - wave analysis is not applicable and one should resort to the findings of schmitt and co - workers @xcite .",
    "in particular , these authors demonstrated that @xmath103 of such a state suffers a strong reduction ( almost 1/3 ) in comparison with the value ( 20.15 j / molek ) expected for an equal - amplitude af state  ( our results are in excellent agreement with this statement ) .",

    "based on the suggestion of detlefs et al @xcite , the magnetic structure below @xmath101  is either a  transverse modulated state with moment orientation away from the b - axis in the bc - plane or a modified spiral - like structure which , due to the low symmetry ( 2 mm ) of the [ 100 ] direction , is likely to suffer fanning or bunching ( becoming more stronger as the temperature is decreased ) .",

    "@xmath4 , on the other hand , reflects the combined influence of the anisotropic forces and interlayer coupling .",

    "in contrast , the weak anisotropy observed in gdni@xmath1b@xmath1c is most probably due to a combination of anisotropic exchange , dipolar , and two - ion magnetoelastic couplings .",
    "it is interesting to discuss one particular aspect of  the interaction between magnons and superconductivity in , say , @xmath0= ho ( @xmath157 ) and dy ( @xmath17 ) : the magnon - mediated pairbreaking effect that manifests itself in the thermal evolution of @xmath158 [ ref.@xcite ] .",

    "therefore doping of ho into dyni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( up to 80% but still @xmath17 ) would not lead to a softening of @xmath4 . then , for this concentration range , there should be no variation in @xmath26 and @xmath119 even though the degennes factor does vary ( remember that within the antiferromagnetic state , the abrikosov - gorkov pairbreaking mechanism is not valid ) .",

    ", we were able to reveal the magnon specific heat contribution of the heavy members of the borocarbides and to identify the expressions that describe their thermal evolution .",
    "these expressions ( given in terms of only two physically accepted parameters ) were derived from the spin - wave analysis of a simple hamiltonian  that consists of effective exchange couplings and anisotropic interactions .",
    "we investigated as well an influence of the magnons on the superconductivity of these af superconductors .",
