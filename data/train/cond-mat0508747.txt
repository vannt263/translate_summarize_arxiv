    "the behavior of interacting fermi systems near continuous quantum phase transitions is a central problem in the physics of strongly correlated systems .",
    "although much work has been done on this subject , there are still many open and as yet unresolved questions . at present the standard theory of quantum phase transitions@xcite",
    "relies primarily on an analysis on the effects of fluctuations perturbatively about the results of hartree - fock theory .",
    "this analysis proceeds in almost complete analogy with the theory of classical critical phenomena about its upper critical dimension , and its straightforward extension to quantum phase transitions . in practice",
    "it consists of an effective theory for a suitable order parameter field while other degrees of freedom , including fermions , are often integrated out at the outset .    in many cases of interest the systems are metallic and have gapless fermionic excitations . in the standard approach ,",
    "their net effect is to introduce damping in the collective modes associated with the order parameter field . in practice",
    "this results in the introduction of dissipative terms in the effective action .",
    "while much of this is certainly correct , this approach implicitly assumes that the fermions are largely unaffected by quantum criticality . why this should be the case is far from obvious .",
    "the assumptions of the landau theory of the fermi liquid@xcite are self - consistent and well justified within the landau phase which has a sizable basin of stability , except in one dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "however , there is no reason for these assumptions to hold outside the landau phase .",
    "however , there is also mounting evidence that these assumptions may also not hold in a number of phases ( and not just at quantum critical points ) , including ferromagnetic metals@xcite and nematic phases of fermi fluids@xcite . the possibility that quantum criticality may lead to non - fermi liquid behavior",
    "has been a focus of research in recent years , primarily ( but not only ) in connection with the physics of the `` normal phase '' of high temperature superconductors@xcite , and with heavy - fermion systems@xcite .",
    "the simplest example where the landau assumptions on the behavior of the quasiparticles are violated is the quantum phase transition from a normal ( landau ) fermi liquid phase to a nematic fermi fluid @xcite .",
    "a nematic fermi fluid is a uniform phase of a system of interacting fermions in which the shape of the fermi surface is distorted _ spontaneously _ , thus breaking rotational invariance.@xcite this state is an example of the fate of a fermi liquid beyond a pomeranchuk instability@xcite . in this case , the landau assumptions appear to be violated throughout this phase , and not just at the quantum critical point.@xcite    the clearest experimental evidence to date of a nematic fermi fluid phase has been found in very clean two - dimensional electron gases in magnetic fields in ultra - clean samples.@xcite the striking resistivity anisotropies that are observed in these experiments can be explained by the onset of nematic order at low temperatures.@xcite it has also been proposed that phases of this type may play a central role on the physics of high temperature superconductors.@xcite this charge - ordered state of a strongly correlated system of fermions is the simplest example of an electronic liquid crystal phase@xcite .",
    "the problem of the fate of the fermions at quantum criticality , and in the `` non - fermi liquid '' phases mentioned above , so far has only been considered within perturbative corrections to hartree - fock / rpa theory .",
    "oganesyan , kivelson and fradkin@xcite found that the quasiparticles are wiped out as well defined quantum states .",
    "this is due to the large fluctuations of ( overdamped ) quadrupolar collective modes",
    ". these authors found , within a hartree - fock and rpa theory , an overdamped collective mode with @xmath0 at the critical point .",
    "they also found that the fermion self - energy acquires , at the quantum critical point , an imaginary part with a frequency dependence following the law @xmath7 .",
    "a similar behavior has been found in the case of the stoner transition and in the antiferromagnetic phase@xcite .",
    "oganesyan and coworkers also found that this behavior holds inside the nematic phase , except along a set of measure zero of directions determined by the symmetry breaking.@xcite however , it seems quite likely that such leading order behavior@xcite may actually signal the complete failure of the landau theory of the fermi liquid .",
    "it is clear that to better understand this problem a non - perturbative analysis of the behavior of the fermions at the quantum phase transitions ( and beyond ) is needed .",
    "chubukov@xcite has given arguments which , in the context of the ferromagnetic metallic transition , suggest that this behavior may persist beyond the lowest order in perturbation theory .",
    "in this paper we will consider the nematic quantum phase transition in fermi fluids using the non - perturbative approach of higher dimensional bosonization@xcite .",
    "we will not discuss the ( important ) lattice effects here .",
    "bosonization is a powerful tool to study the non - perturbative behavior of one - dimensional gapless fermi systems , the best understood fermionic quantum critical systems@xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the kinematics of one - dimensional systems is so constrained that the bosonic collective modes completely exhaust the spectrum of these fermionic systems , allowing even for a full reconstruction of the fermionic operators entirely in terms of bosons . a striking result if one - dimensional system is that the electron acquires a non - trivial anomalous dimension and it is no longer the quasiparticle of these systems , even for arbitrarily weak interactions . for these reasons one - dimensional gapless fermi systems",
    "have been termed ` luttinger liquids ' .",
    "the actual quasiparticles are non - trivial solitons which are orthogonal to a bare electron.@xcite    in dimensions higher than one the physics ( and the kinematics ) is quite different than in one dimension .",
    "nevertheless bosonization methods still yield the physics of the landau theory of the fermi liquid correctly.@xcite superficially this may seem surprising since in dimensions higher than one there are no longer strong kinematic constraints , and consequently the bosonic collective modes can not exhaust the spectrum of an interacting fermi system . instead , except for narrow regimes in which the collective modes are stable quantum states , they exhibit landau damping , reflecting their decay into particle - hole pairs .",
    "it is a key check of the validity of higher dimensional bosonization that it gets the physics of landau damping.@xcite    one appealing feature of higher dimensional bosonization is that it is actually a theory of the quantum fluctuations of the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "it is thus a natural approach to study quantum phase transitions associated with pomeranchuk instabilities , and in particular the nematic state.@xcite more specifically , we focus on the nematic case for spinless fermions and compare with the work of oganesyan and coworkers@xcite based on rpa and hartree - fock . we find that the physics of the bosonic collective modes is the same in bosonization and in rpa , and thus our results agree with those of ref .",
    "[ ] in the landau phase , in the nematic phase and at the quantum critical point .",
    "perhaps , this is not so surprising since at long wavelengths rpa becomes asymptotically exact and this is the regime in which bosonization is correct ( for a more thorough discussion , see ) . in particular we derive the effective action near the quantum critical point and find that it does have a hertz - millis form with dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 , consistent with the findings oganesyan and coworkers@xcite , and by nilsson and castro neto@xcite , but in disagreement with the results of k. yang@xcite .",
    "we further use bosonization methods to obtain the fermion propagator .",
    "this result is well beyond the hartree - fock / rpa theory and thus it allows us to study the fate of the fermions non - perturbatively .",
    "we find striking violations of the landau assumptions for fermi liquids .",
    "thus , the equal - time behavior of the fermion propagator at the quantum critical point ( at zero temperature ) is found to fall off faster than any power , decaying instead with a law @xmath8 as a function of distance .",
    "the same behavior is found in the nematic phase except along symmetry - determined directions .",
    "we also verify explicitely from this expression the vanishing of the fermion residue as expected from this kind of behavior .",
    "in contrast to the equal - time behavior , at quantum criticality the fermion auto - correlation function behaves as @xmath9 , with a similar albeit anisotropic law in the nematic phase as well .",
    "we also find that the low energy behavior of the one - particle density of states @xmath10 exhibits an enhancement to a zero frequency value @xmath4 which we find to be larger than @xmath5 , its non - interacting value . at finite but low frequency",
    "we further find that this one - particle density of states behaves as @xmath11 ( @xmath6 is a constant ) , _ i.e. _ a cusp at @xmath12 .",
    "thus , our bosonization results confirm that the nematic phase of a fermi fluid is a _ non - fermi liquid_. however , its behavior is more complex than the predictions of the hartree - fock / rpa theory .",
    "recently chubukov@xcite has examined the behavior of the fermion self - energy in perturbation theory at the ferromagnetic quantum critical point and found that the frequency - dependence is not changed by higher order corrections .",
    "our results for the auto - correlation function are consistent with his results , as well as with refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] .",
    "however we also find that the equal - time propagator ( the `` one - particle density matrix '' ) has a very different behavior than what is predicted from these diagrammatic methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : pomeranchuk ] we derive a theory of the nematic qcp via higher dimensional bosonization .",
    "here we present a theory of the quantum phase transition to the nematic fermi fluid , section [ p : saddle ] , and show that it reproduces the analog of hertz - millis theory for this problem .",
    "in particular we give a detailed analysis of the spectral functions of the collective modes , section [ p : qmoments ] , and derive the effective action valid in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition , section [ p : otheory ] . in section [ sec : fermions ] we use bosonization methods to calculate the fermion propagator . here we extract the full diagrammatic perturbation theory of the fermion green function from bosonization , and use it to calculate the fermion self - energy . here",
    "we check that the bosonization formulas reproduce correctly the non - fermi liquid behavior found within the hartree - fock / rpa theory@xcite .",
    "we then use the full bosonized expression for the fermion propagator . here",
    "we find large violations to fermi liquid theory both at quantum criticality and in the nematic fermi fluid phase . as an application we give a calculation of the fermion one - particle density of states .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] we draw our conclusions . to help keep this paper self contained , in appendix [ ap : bosonintro ] we give a short review the extension of bosonization to @xmath13-dimensional fermi systems .",
    "( for a more in depth review , see ref . [ ] ) . in appendix",
    "[ ap : part ] we summarize details of the effective quadrupolar interactions , including fermion screening and landau damping effects . in appendix",
    "[ ap : f0 ] we discuss the effects of the ( uncondensed ) s - wave channel on the effective theory for the nematic .",
    "the details of the calculation of the boson propagators are given in appendix [ ap : equalt ] .",
    "in this section , we consider the boson theory , obtained via an extension of bosonization to greater than one dimension , near a nematic ( pomeranchuk ) instability of a translationally invariant fermion system . in the notation of appendix [ ap : bosonintro ] , we take the following action for the bosons @xmath14\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and forward scattering interactions    @xmath15    here , @xmath16 labels the patch defined by coarse graining the fermi surface , and the density of quasiparticles in a patch may be obtained from the boson field @xmath17 via the relation @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is therefore the interaction between particle - hole pairs in patches @xmath16 and @xmath20 .",
    "we begin by analyzing our bosonized theory for a constant field configuration and reproduce pomeranchuk s result .",
    "consider configurations such that @xmath21 is constant in space and time over some particular range of time t. the resulting action is : @xmath22 where we have expanded @xmath21 as : @xmath23\\ ] ] and introduced the fermi liquid parameters via @xmath24 hence , for arbitrary @xmath25 , we find that any @xmath26 will destabilize the fermi liquid .",
    "the point @xmath27 we shall call the pomeranchuk ( nematic for @xmath28 ) quantum critical point ( qcp ) . though fermi liquid theory breaks down at this point , luttinger s theorem is still obeyed .",
    "it should also be noted that in the above analysis we could have included interactions involving large angle scattering ( which may lead to charge density / spin density wave instabilities ) , corrections to the linearized dispersion , three- or four - body interactions and bcs processes in the bosonized theory . however , except for bcs processes , these effects are irrelevant in the fermi liquid phase though some become important near the the nematic critical point to be discussed below .    for simplicity , in the rest of this section , we shall specialize to the @xmath28 instability in two - spatial dimensions , the 2d quantum nematic liquid crystal , though the results generalize easily",
    ".      to study the nematic qcp , originally considered by oganesyan , kivelson and fradkin@xcite , we set all @xmath29 to zero for @xmath30 .",
    "this is reasonable since these other modes are not critical and their effect is only to introduce finite renormalizations of the parameters in the effective theory of the critical ( quadrupolar ) modes ( see below ) .    on the broken symmetry side ( i. e. @xmath31 ) ,",
    "the quadratic action is no longer stable .",
    "so , in order to make the theory consistent , we need ( at least ) a quartic term in the bosonized action . here , as a specific example , we consider the quartic interaction that arises from corrections to the linearized dispersion in the bosonized form given in ref . [ ] , @xmath32 this term can be found by a direct extension of our @xmath33 expansion of to third order , noticing that it is an exponential series in @xmath34 .",
    "an estimate of @xmath35 may therefore naturally be obtained from the equations of motion of either the boson or fermion pictures . however",
    ", this is not the only quartic contribution to the action since an 8-fermion interaction term ( that is quartic in densities ) also contributes at this level with a more general form similar to the fermi liquid interactions .",
    "nevertheless , this will give us a flavor of the broken symmetry phase .",
    "since this effective theory is no longer quadratic in the bosonic fields , we will examine its behavior within a semiclassical approximation , which means that we will first find the extremal configuration and then expand about it .",
    "thus , we write @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the solution of the classical equations of motion at a uniform , mean field level : @xmath38 where as stated earlier , we set @xmath39 for @xmath30 . because the non - linear term is cubic , we seek solutions of the type @xmath40 where @xmath41 for @xmath42 . in terms of the @xmath43 s ,",
    "the equation of motion becomes @xmath44 we first observe that for @xmath45 , the only possible solution is @xmath46 for all @xmath47 , as expected for the isotropic case . if @xmath48 , there exits a whole set of non trivial solutions involving , in general , all harmonics @xmath49 obeying particle hole symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , when we are near the phase transition , _ i. e. _ @xmath50 , one can find the set of solutions analytically with : @xmath51 using the notation of and for the higher harmonics @xmath52 so that in the limit @xmath53 we can neglect the higher harmonics .    from this calculation",
    ", we conclude that near the    @xmath54 nematic qcp , the fermi surface takes the simple shape : @xmath55 where @xmath56 picks out the major axis of the ellipse that is spontaneously chosen . without loss of generality , from now on we will set @xmath57 .",
    "we also conclude that further away from the critical point , the anharmonic quartic terms generically introduce higher harmonics to this shape . from this point of view for example , the fermi surface in the nematic phase may become increasingly flatter away from the critical point leading to an additional instability towards a smectic phase breaking translational order in one direction .",
    "however , this phase transition can not be seen within our forward scattering only model and all that happens deeper into the phase here is that the shape becomes more anharmonic .",
    "it should also be noted that the other harmonics , @xmath58 , appear when particle hole symmetry is broken , _ e. g. _ when a cubic term in the action is introduced ( @xmath59 ) corresponding to the addition of quadratic terms to the fermion dispersion .",
    "the next step beyond mean field theory is to formulate an order parameter theory . to that end , in this section we are interested in focusing on describing the behavior of the quadrupole moment density , @xmath60 .",
    "again , for our present purposes we shall keep only @xmath61 .",
    "however , in appendix [ ap : f0 ] we show that by keeping also @xmath62 , the additional effects of the non - critical modes do not change our results in any essential way .",
    "now , our goal here is to obtain an action entirely in terms of @xmath63 .",
    "this can be easily accomplished by following ref . [ ] and using a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to aid the diagonalization . in the end , however , both the auxiliary fields and @xmath64 for @xmath65 shall be integrated out .    in momentum space",
    ", our free action can be written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the density - density response function in the `` small q '' limit of patch @xmath16 with @xmath68 .",
    "( note : when needed , we regularize the denominator by letting @xmath69 according to the usual time ordering prescription . )",
    "the interactions , described by the quadratic action @xmath70 , _ c.f . _",
    "eq . , become _ diagonal _ in the angular momentum basis , _",

    "the contributions from the other angular momentum channels have a similar form ( in terms of the respective landau parameters . )    to aid the diagonalization , we split up the free part of the action , @xmath75 , using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation : @xmath76\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and then switch over to the angular momentum basis : @xmath77\\label{eq : fullsigma}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in the large-@xmath78 limit , we have @xmath79 here we have fourier transformed with respect to @xmath80 , that is , @xmath81 .",
    "now , we will integrate out all the @xmath82 densities , except for @xmath28 .",
    "this can be easily done since @xmath75 is a linear function of these fields , while they are absent in @xmath70 .",
    "this is so for this model with only a quadrupolar interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ we have set their corresponding fermi liquid parameters to zero .",
    "( in the vicinity of the nematic transition it is straightforward to include the effects of the @xmath83 channels .",
    "their net effect is to give rise to simple renormalizations of the effective theory we are about to derive .",
    "a detailed analysis is given appendix [ ap : f0 ] ) . the result is a delta function for the @xmath84 fields , allowing us to also integrate them out with the net result to simply set @xmath85 for all @xmath47 except @xmath28 .",
    "this gives us the following simple expression for the effective free action : @xmath86      \\\\\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and we now have an action entirely in terms of the quadrupole moment density .    the final step is to integrate out the @xmath87 fields .",
    "this is easily accomplished and we obtain the gaussian level of the order parameter theory , including the effects of the interactions @xmath70 . the action of the effective theory is : @xmath88= \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\frac{d^2qd\\omega}{(2\\pi)^3}\\left [    \\frac{1}{\\chi_2^{+}}\\big|m_2^{+}\\big|^2 +    \\frac{1}{\\chi_2^{-}}\\big|m_2^{-}\\big|^2   \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the dynamical correlation function ( susceptibility ) of the quadrupolar densities : @xmath90 and @xmath91      \\label{eq : chi0}\\ ] ] with @xmath92 naturally , this is just rpa quadrupolar susceptibility of ref .",
    "we should stress that the effective action @xmath93 of eq .",
    "include the effects of the non - linear interactions represented in @xmath94 , _",
    "_ eq . , which are crucial to stabilize the nematic state past the nematic qcp ( for @xmath95 ) .",
    "as we discussed above , these non - linear terms do mix the different angular momentum channels .",
    "however , provided there is no condensation for @xmath96 it is still possible to integrate out these degrees of freedom , at least perturbatively .",
    "thus , sufficiently close to the nematic qcp , the effects of the higher angular momentum channels will remain perturbatively small .",
    "furthermore , should we have decided to integrate out the density fields , @xmath97 in favor of the auxiliary fields @xmath98 , we would have found the propagators of the @xmath99 fields to be the rpa effective interaction : @xmath100 the action of the @xmath99 fields is precisely that found by oganesyan and coworkers@xcite also obtained through a hubbard - stratonovich transformation but performed directly in the fermion theory .",
    "we shall find that understanding this interaction is the key to understanding the physics of the nematic qcp .",
    "the theory with the action given by eqs . and seemingly describes the quantum mechanics of a fluctuating surface .",
    "this suggests that the effective degrees of freedom ought to be long - lived bosonic modes of the fluctuations of the shape of the fermi surface . in other terms , this bosonized theory would seem to be entirely described by stable collective modes . however , these bosonic excitations are not generally stable due to _ landau damping _ effects , represented by the branch cut singularities in @xcite",
    ".    we will examine this problem more closely .",
    "it is useful to introduce the _ quadrupole density spectral functions _ : @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the spectral function of @xmath103 , the correlation function of the @xmath98 fields .",
    "the analysis is greatly simplified upon recognizing that @xmath103 is a polynomial function of @xmath104 . for @xmath28",
    "the denominator of @xmath105 is a cubic function of @xmath106 , whereas for @xmath107 it is quadratic in @xmath106 . in appendix",
    "[ ap : part ] we show that @xmath103 have the partial fraction expansions : @xmath108 where @xmath109 for @xmath110 , and @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "we can therefore view @xmath103 as a sum of terms each of the form of the rpa s - wave channel effective interaction , renormalized by a residue @xmath113 and with an effective interaction @xmath114 .",
    "details of these expansions are given in appendix [ ap : part ] .    , eq .",
    "and eq . for @xmath115 ,",
    "very close to the nematic quantum phase transition from the fermi liquid phase , @xmath116 .",
    "as the qcp is approached , there is a large increase of spectral weight in the the @xmath0 overdamped quadrupolar mode at very low frequency .",
    "notice the delta function contribution of the propagating mode with @xmath117 discussed in the text .",
    "the propagating mode with @xmath118 gives a similar delta function contribution ( with smaller spectral weight ) to @xmath119.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    near the nematic qcp , where @xmath120 , upon defining the quantity @xmath121 @xmath122 the effective interactions @xmath103 become simple and we obtain : @xmath123      \\label{eq : v2+}\\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",
    "v_2 ^ -(q , s ) \\approx \\frac{1}{4n(0)}\\frac{1}{s^2+\\frac{\\delta_2(q)}{4 } } \\label{eq : v2- } \\ ] ] thus , near the critical point we find a propagating mode with dispersion @xmath124 ( a @xmath117 mode ) , represented by the pole in the second term for @xmath110 ( see eq . ) , and another one with dispersion @xmath125 ( a @xmath118 mode ) , given by the pole in @xmath112 ( see eq . ) .",
    "furthermore , we also find an overdamped mode , given by the pole in first term of @xmath110 ( see eq . ) , with a dispersion relation of @xmath126 , and dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath127 sufficiently small , and asymptotically close to the nematic quantum critical point , we find that this overdamped mode dominates the spectral function over the other two ( propagating ) modes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : v ] we present a plot the spectral function   @xmath128 .",
    "it shows that , as the qcp is approached from the fermi liquid side , there is a large transfer of spectral weight in the quadrupolar spectral function to the low frequency end of the spectrum , associated with the emergence of the overdamped @xmath0 mode .",
    "this mode thus controls the quantum critical behavior .",
    "conversely , normal fermi - liquid behavior is obtained if @xmath129 is finite so that @xmath117 . on the other hand , if the overdamped mode were to be absent , the dynamic critical behavior would be controlled by propagating mode with @xmath118 discussed above .",
    "the trend is thus opposite to what one might naively expect : the higher the @xmath130 , the higher the effective dimension @xmath131 , the stronger the divergence of the overdamped mode .",
    "recently , yang@xcite proposed that the transition to the quantum nematic state should have dynamic critical exponent @xmath118 .",
    "the analysis we just presented shows that this is not the case .    as a result of the above analysis , we obtain the following effective action for the quadrupole density near the nematic qcp : @xmath132\\bigg ] \\\\-      \\frac{\\gamma}{8n(0)^3n}\\int d^2xdt      \\big({m^+_2}^2+{m^-_2}^2\\big)^2\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the order parameter field is @xmath133 where , again , @xmath134 is the direction of @xmath135 .",
    "this action is therefore very similar to hertz s action for the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition in itinerant fermionic systems@xcite , but here within the context of the formation of nematic order ( and similar actions may also be obtained for higher @xmath47 ) .",
    "recently , nilsson and castro neto @xcite derived this action using fermi liquid theory methods .    now , let us look on the broken symmetry side , in the nematic phase . as in an in any theory with an @xmath136 symmetry , here we will find that the order parameter will spontaneously pick a direction .",
    "as a result , it is no longer useful to fourier transform with respect to @xmath134 in eq . .",
    "rotating back and after the saddle point expansion about the classical configuration , we find the quadratic action on the nematic side :    @xmath137    where @xmath138 and @xmath139    in the reference frame in which the nematic order parameter is diagonal , _",
    "i.e. _ its principal axes , whose orientation is determined spontaneously .",
    "the difference between this action and the previous one discussed above for the symmetric phase , is the emergence of the last term which originates from the non - linear ( quartic ) term in the effective action .",
    "this term ruins our ability to rotate @xmath134 out of the action .    noting that the off - diagonal terms are higher order in @xmath140 , we may write this in the simplified form :    @xmath141    \\label{eq : sqcp - nematic}\\ ] ]    we see that now @xmath142 is the amplitude mode , which has @xmath117 , while @xmath143 is the nematic goldstone mode _ which continues to have dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 even in the nematic phase_.@xcite    the last point is to discuss how this affects the original boson theory .",
    "if we bring back all the integrated out angular momentum channels , we find that the free action on the broken symmetry side has : @xmath144 with a weakly renormalized fermi velocity @xmath145 hence , spontaneous symmetry breaking essentially produces a goldstone mode that continues the critical , @xmath0 behavior into the nematic phase while leaving the rest of the theory virtually untouched until deep into the broken symmetry phase .",
    "in the past sections we discussed the behavior of the collective modes near the nematic quantum phase transition .",
    "much of what we discussed in the previous section on the behavior of the collective modes is indeed in complete agreement with the rpa treatment of this theory@xcite .",
    "this should not be a surprise since rpa is asymptotically exact at low energies and at low frequencies .",
    "this is also the reason while bosonization works in the same regime .",
    "we will now turn our attention to the behavior of the fermionic degrees of freedom near the nematic qcp and and in the nematic phase .",
    "this is very different problem . in ref .",
    "[ ] the behavior of the fermion green function was studied perturbatively and a startling non - fermi liquid behavior was found already at the lowest ( `` fock '' ) order . however , this very finding raises questions on the applicability of perturbation theory for the fermion propagator . in this section",
    "we will use bosonization methods to address this problem .    here",
    "we will use bosonization to compute the fermion propagator . within this approach one has a theory for the bosonized degrees of freedom and a set of operator identities relating observables of the fermionic theory to those of the bosonic theory . for",
    "a summary see appendix [ ap : bosonintro ] .",
    "there are two important issues to keep in mind .",
    "one is that the bosonized theory is exact for a fermionic theory with a linearized dispersion and forward scattering interactions ( _ i.e. _ those described by landau parameters ) .",
    "the other is that one has , within this theory , an operator to represent the fermion .",

    "the behavior of the exponential should be dominated by high energy effects which are insensitive to whether the system is in a fermi liquid , a quantum critical point or in a nematic phase .",

    "we have constructed an order parameter theory from the boson theory by integrating out non - critical modes and verified that this boson theory is equivalent to rpa .",
    "we then turned to studying the bosonization form of the fermion propagator and found its diagrammatic expansion proving the correctness and clarifying the arguments leading up to that expression .",
    "this diagrammatic expansion keeps all diagrams up to the simple bubble in the spirit of rpa as applied to the density - density propagator and shows , in specific , that bosonization goes beyond the self - consistent born approximation to include vertex corrections .",

    "lastly , we calculated the fermion propagator non - perturbatively and found the dramatic effect of the overdamped critical mode that induces short ranged spatial correlations that decay nearly exponentially @xmath281 , while the auto - correlation function exhibits a milder non - fermi liquid behavior of the form @xmath282 . from this short ranged behavior of the equal time green function",

    "now that we have a controlled definition of the density operator , we proceed with computing its commutator : @xmath326 =    \\frac{i n(0)\\hbar v_f}{\\epsilon_n+\\epsilon_n ' }    \\delta_{s , t}\\delta_t^{d-1}({\\bf x_t - x_t'})\\\\    \\times\\bigg(\\delta\\big(x_n - x_n ' - ( \\epsilon_n+\\epsilon_n')/2\\big ) -          \\delta\\big(x_n - x_n ' + ( \\epsilon_n+\\epsilon_n')/2\\big)\\bigg)\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] expanding both sides of this equation in powers of @xmath33 and equating like powers gives us the following result @xmath327 & =    -i\\hbar n(0 )    \\delta_{s , t}{\\bf v}_s\\cdot\\nabla\\delta^{d}({\\bf x - x'})\\label{eq : kacmoody}\\\\    \\big[\\delta\\hat n_s({\\bf x}),{\\mathcal h}_{t}^0({\\bf x'})\\big ] & =      -i\\hbar{\\bf v}_s\\cdot\\nabla\\delta\\hat n_s({\\bf x})\\delta^{d}({\\bf x - x'})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using these commutators , we may compute the equation of motion for the heisenberg operator @xmath328 : @xmath329 where @xmath330 .",
    "this is the linearized collisionless boltzmann equation in operator form found by castro neto and fradkin in the context of a coherent state formalism@xcite .",
    "we also notice through this derivation that we may let @xmath331 and obtain exactly the same answer .",
    "hence , the hamiltonian may be expressed entirely in terms of the density operator @xmath332 .",
    "a natural consequence of is that the density operator may be expressed in terms of a chiral boson field : @xmath333 with a canonically conjugate momentum @xmath334 these chiral bosons are a direct extension of the right / left chiral bosons in the context of 1d bosonization . following this extension then",
    ", we may express the fermion operator as a vertex operator @xmath335 where @xmath336 is a set of klein factors responsible for ensuring that @xmath337 obey the proper anti - commutation relations within the patch and on different patches .",
    "the relation between this fermion operator and the original @xmath338-operators will be made precise in section [ sec : diaseries ] via direct comparison of the perturbation series in @xmath339 obtained in the bosonized theory .",
    "@xmath337 , therefore , is equivalent to @xmath340 in the free case and in the interacting case , it is this operator projected onto the high - density subspace .",
    "hence , this is an effective low energy theory of a dense fermi system and @xmath341 can be viewed as actually creating landau quasiparticles in the fermi liquid phase .",
    "the canonical structure of the bosonized theory also allows us to directly write down a path integral formulation of the problem , including interactions described by a set of landau parameters ( for a derivation using coherent states , see ref . [ ] ) . the action for the bosonized theory has the general form    @xmath342 +    \\frac{n(0)}{2}\\sum_{s , t}\\int d^2xd^2x'dt       f_{s - t}({\\bf x - x ' } )      { \\bf v}_s\\cdot\\nabla\\varphi_s({\\bf x}){\\bf v}_t\\cdot\\nabla      \\varphi_t({\\bf x'})\\ ] ]",
    "this action is a quadratic form in the bose fields .",
    "here we have not included higher order terms ( such as those discussed in the body of the paper , in the context of the nematic instability ) .",
    "such terms are generally present due to non - linearities in the fermion dispersion relation , as well as many - body effective interactions.@xcite we have also not included `` vertex operators '' such as those associated with pairing ( bcs ) interactions.@xcite we shall find it more convenient to work within this path - integral formulation when constructing a theory of the nematic quantum critical point .    before leaving our discussion of high dimensional bosonization",
    ", we should make a final comment on its validity . as discussed in the main body of the paper ,",
    "the boson theory here completely recovers the random phase approximation ( rpa ) in the long wavelength limit .",
    "this should not be surprising since , in the asymptotic low energy limit , both rpa and bosonization saturate the f - sum rule and are ( formally ) exact .",
    "this is a well known established property of bosonization , extensively discussed in the literature since the 1970 s .",
    "here we present the partial fraction expansion of the effective interactions @xmath110 and @xmath112 and their behavior near quantum criticality .      in terms of the function @xmath104 we may write @xmath110 as @xmath343^{-1}\\\\                 & = \\frac{1}{2n(0)}\\bigg[\\frac{(1+x)^2 } {      x^3-\\frac{\\delta_2}{2}x^2+(1-\\delta_2(q))x-\\frac{\\delta_2(q)}{2}}\\bigg ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath344 .",

    "here we calculate @xmath362 for the case when both @xmath363 and @xmath364 are present and we let @xmath364 approach the nematic qcp ( @xmath365 ) .",
    "we shall find , however , that the critical behavior is utterly independent of @xmath363 ! now , let @xmath366 returning to the @xmath367-theory , whose correlators are the rpa interaction @xmath362 , we find in this case @xmath368\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath369 and @xmath370 as a result , @xmath371 is completely unaffected by the presence of @xmath363 due to the fact that there is no @xmath372 field and opposite `` signs '' decouple .",

    "again we find that the polynomial is cubic .",
    "hence , the addition of @xmath363 only complicates the algebra , but not the general structure of the solution .",
    "we therefore continue as in appendix [ ap : part ] .    solving the cubic equation in leads to an algebraically complicated result .",
    "however , it simplifies near the nematic qcp and we find to lowest order in @xmath378 : @xmath379 which return to our previous result if we let @xmath380 or @xmath381 .",
    "notice that , to lowest order @xmath382 is independent of @xmath363 , as it should since the s - wave mode is non - critical and this `` pole '' precisely represents the critical behavior .",
