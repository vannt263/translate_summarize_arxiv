    "the films were grown by pulsed laser deposition at @xmath56@xmath57c in @xmath58 mbar of o@xmath55 with a repetition rate of 1 hz . the fluence of the laser pulses was 0.6 j/@xmath59 .",
    "the film s growth was monitored _ in situ _ using reflection high energy electron diffraction which allowed the thickness to be controlled with sub - unit - cell precision .",

    "the magnetoconductance of a disordered electronic system is determined by different contributions that can be classified into two categories : one is interaction ( coulomb ) and the other is weak localization ( wl ) .",
    "the former class consists of exchange and hartree terms ( showing in zeeman - type effects ) while the latter consists of orbital , zeeman and spin - orbit terms .",
    "space inversion asymmetry promotes spin - orbit scattering processes of the dresselhaus @xcite and rashba @xcite types . in the diffusive limit ,",
    "both of these effects contribute to the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) spin relaxation rate , and hence enter the expression of the wl correction to the magnetoconductivity @xmath70 @xcite.the dresselhaus term contains two pieces . in a confined geometry ,",
    "one is proportional to ( 1- @xmath71 ) @xcite , where @xmath72 is the thickness of the electron gas layer . from estimates of @xmath72 @xcite and of @xmath46",
    ", one sees that this part is essentially zero .",
    "the other piece enters the expression of the spin - orbit field hso and adds to the rashba term . fitting the data to the analytical expression of @xmath70 for fields @xmath73 and @xmath74 shows that the rashba contribution dominates . in that case ,",
    "a closed form of @xmath70 has been derived by punnoose @xcite , which reduces to the maekawa - fukuyama expression , in the limit @xmath73 . including the zeeman term allows us to determine @xmath34 , the inelastic field @xmath40 , and also @xmath35 .",
    "we find that the same parameters provide an accurate fit of the data for @xmath74 . in 2d ,",
    "in the diffusive regime , both wl and interaction effects yield logarithmic corrections to the magnetoconductance .",
    "it is thus difficult , analyzing only the magnetoconductance in perpendicular field , to sort out the different contributions .",
    "however , a magnetic field applied parallel to the conducting 2d layer quenches the orbital motion and , provided the spin - orbit contribution is negligible , leaves only the coulomb contribution , whose strength depends on the electrons g - factor @xmath35 . in this case",
    ", the magnetic field polarizes the spins and leads to a negative contribution to the magnetoconductance .",
    "similarly , if one applies a strong enough perpendicular field , one freezes out the wl correction which reveals the coulomb contribution . in this field orientation",

    "s2 displays magnetoconductance measurements for the parallel and perpendicular field orientations . for gate voltages smaller than 0",
    "v , the zeeman contribution is small up to 4 t .",
    "one has to recall ( see fig .",
    "2c ) that @xmath35 is small so that , in this concentration range , wl effects dominate for both field orientations . in this regard",
    ", we remark that the maekawa - fukuyama s theory predicts in the presence of spin - orbit scattering a weak ( compared to the perpendicular case ) negative parallel magnetoconductance @xcite .",
    "this is precisely what we observe for this range of gate voltages as shown in fig .",
    "this observation , together with the absence of hysteresis , suggests that the positive magnetoconductance observed in the perpendicular orientation does not arise from magnetic effects .    since the parameters that are extracted using eq . 2 give excellent fits to the experimental data both at low and high perpendicular fields",
    ", this indicates that for gate voltages up to 100v , coulomb interactions yield small contributions compared to wl .",
    "we remark ( fig .",
    "s2 ) for high concentrations ( 150 v , 200 v and 250 v ) that in small parallel fields ( less then 2 t ) a negative magnetoconductance is observed as expected from spin - orbit and coulomb contributions .",
    "the behaviour observed at higher parallel fields ( positive magnetoconductance ) is unclear at the moment and might be explained by the finite thickness of the electron gas @xcite . in the high positive voltage",
    "range a fit of the experimental data in perpendicular field could not be obtained by using wl contributions only . since in this doping",

    "<S> this unexpected behaviour , named weak antilocalization , is observed in laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 heterostructures polarized above a particular gate field . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit relaxation time is therefore an essential ingredient to describe transport in a two - dimensional electron gas in the presence of a strong homogeneous electric field . </S>",
    "<S> as previously discussed , the conduction electrons will experience an internal magnetic field which is always perpendicular to their wave vector @xmath4 . in a diffusive system </S>",

    "<S> the rashba coupling constant @xmath9 and the spin relaxation time @xmath18 are related through @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the carrier mass and @xmath14 the diffusion constant . </S>",
    "<S> an additional spin - orbit term pertaining to the dp process is discussed in the supplementary information . a second class of spin relaxation processes , known as the elliott - yafet ( ey ) mechanism , originates from the spin - orbit interaction of the lattice ions with the conduction electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this spin relaxation mechanism can become relevant in the presence of strong spin - orbit scattering impurities or whenever the ionic spin - orbit coupling produces a significant correction to the band structure of the material . </S>",
    "<S> in the case of srtio@xmath0 , band structure calculations show that the ti 3d conduction bands are notably altered by this correction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in principle both mechanisms can be at play at the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interfaces . </S>",

    "<S> this deviation coincides with the departure from the collision - dominated regime which occurs as @xmath18 becomes of order @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this evolution points towards a strong spin - orbit coupling where an electron spin may precess through several cycles before scattering . </S>",
    "<S> these observations indicate that the unusually strong and tunable spin - orbit interaction found in laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 heterostructures arises from the interfacial breaking of inversion symmetry . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , the charge profile of the electron gas in srtio@xmath0 is strongly modified as the carrier density is varied . ultimately , it is this modification of the asymmetry of the charge profile that strongly affects the evolution of the rashba coupling .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : length]a and d , where we notice that the superconducting dome , measured on the same sample , develops as the spin relaxation time becomes significantly smaller than the inelastic scattering time . </S>",
    "<S> this finding suggests that the spin - orbit interaction plays an important role in stabilizing a delocalized phase in two dimensions @xcite which condenses into a superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> the gate voltage dependence of the diffusion coefficient previously presented corroborates this interpretation . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : length]c we can appreciate the sharp increase of the spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath9 , calculated using equation [ eq : alpha ] , as we move across the quantum critical point and the corresponding rise of the spin splitting @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this remarkable correlation between the critical temperature and the intensity of spin fluctuations is suggestive of an unconventional superconducting order parameter at the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large change in spin relaxation across the phase diagram , which is not yet fully understood , may result from a complex dependence of the spin - orbit coupling on band structure properties and charge profile asymmetry and should stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the spin splitting values can be much higher than the superconducting gap ( which is of the order of 40@xmath54ev at optimal doping ) and comparable to the fermi energy ( which is of the order of 20mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence the spin - orbit coupling turns out to be an essential ingredient to describe the electronic properties of the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface , both in the normal and superconducting state .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the electric field control of spin coherence at the interface between two complex oxides , laalo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 , has been demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> quantum interference effects have been used as a probe of spin dependent transport , uncovering a remarkable correlation between the rashba spin - orbit coupling and the electronic phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> these observations suggest that a manipulation of the spin - orbit coupling in complex oxides interfaces can potentially drive fundamental changes in their ground states , opening a new pathway toward spintronics . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to control the zeeman and rashba spin splitting in an oxide system is particularly promising , as fully spin polarized materials can be integrated in functional heterostructures . </S>",
