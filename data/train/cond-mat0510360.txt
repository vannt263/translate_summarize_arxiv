    "the presence of these suggests that magnetic correlations may play an important role in the formation of superconductivity in hydrated na@xmath8coo@xmath1 , as is believed to be the case for the superconducting cuprates .",

    "reasons for the relatively strong @xmath5-axis magnetic coupling have been discussed recently by johannes _",
    "et al._@xcite surprisingly , although the magnetic correlations are rather strong the ordered moment is only 0.10.2  @xmath17.@xcite    the first aim of this work was to extend the measurements of the spin - wave dispersion in na@xmath2coo@xmath1 down to lower energies where we might gain important information on the magnetic ground state , such as whether itinerant effects are important .",

    "both these gaps are found to close at the bulk magnetic transition temperature @xmath1822  k.    the second part of the paper presents a novel way to investigate the magnetic structure of na@xmath8coo@xmath1 ( @xmath19 ) and also to gain information about spin anisotropy . in the accepted a - type antiferromagnetic structure ( fig .",

    "the experiment we describe here was originally designed to confirm the proposed magnetic structure by a method that employs unpolarized neutrons but avoids the problem of having to separate the weak magnetic scattering from the strong non - magnetic background signal .",

    "the authors interpreted this as a spin - flop transition in which the ordered moments rotate by @xmath3290 degrees while preserving the a - type antiferromagnetic arrangement .",
    "after the transition the spins lie approximately in the hexagonal plane , but the magnetic structure has a small ferromagnetic component along the @xmath5 axis . assuming this explanation to be correct we induced the spin - flop transition in a neutron diffraction experiment and searched for magnetic bragg peaks along @xmath33 , since now the ordered moment should be perpendicular to the scattering wavevector and should scatter neutrons .",

    "the spectrum consists of an intense peak due to incoherent nuclear elastic scattering centered on @xmath45  mev , and a broad signal centered around 2  mev which is attributed to magnetic scattering as the scan cuts through the spin - wave dispersion .",

    "we have shown that both gaps disappear quite suddenly at approximately 20  k. from the proximity of this temperature to the bulk magnetic transition at @xmath3  k found in magnetization studies we infer that the spin waves have the same origin as the @xmath96 transition .",
    "this may seem obvious , but the strength of the spin - wave scattering in comparison to the small size of the ordered moment made it important to confirm that the observed spin excitations were really associated with the magnetic order .    we have successfully observed the magnetic bragg peak at @xmath80 in na@xmath4coo@xmath1 with unpolarized neutrons by inducing a spin - flop transition in a vertical magnetic field .",
    "the transition occurred at a field of @xmath124  t , but was broad , with a width of approximately 3  t. it is possible that the broadening of the transition may be due to disorder in the structure , which would lead to a spread of values of the interlayer exchange constant @xmath12 and in turn lead to a range of values for @xmath99 .",
    "we have presented a simple calculation of the spin - flop transition field that would be expected based on the anisotropy parameters derived from the measurement of the spin gap in na@xmath2coo@xmath1 .",
    "the calculated value for this critical field of @xmath125  t is in strong agreement with the observed value for na@xmath4coo@xmath1 of @xmath124  t. we take this as further evidence that the a - type antiferromagnetic structure with its associated gapped spin excitations is the same phase marked by the transition temperature @xmath12622  k in magnetization data .",
    "although we have confirmed the magnetic structure and characterized the excitation gap , the nature of the magnetic ground state in na@xmath8coo@xmath1 is still in question . in an ionic picture",
    "there are @xmath127 co@xmath123 ions carrying spin @xmath128 in a background of @xmath53 co@xmath129 ions , which are usually assumed to be non - magnetic .",
    "however , it is uncertain whether these ions would be ordered or clustered or randomly distributed , @xcite and there is also evidence that na@xmath8coo@xmath1 is a good metal , which would suggest that an itinerant picture might be more appropriate.@xcite a weakly itinerant ground state with strong spin fluctuations would be consistent with both the small ordered moment ( @xmath130 ) and the fact that the energy scale of the magnetic excitations is much greater than the magnetic ordering temperature .    in this vein , the clean gap we have observed in the spin - wave dispersion points towards a system of local moments with a small symmetry - breaking anisotropy field , which is supported by our successful description of the data using a simple spin - wave model based on localized co spins .",
    "however , the large intrinsic widths are not consistent with a model of purely localized co ions , and can be taken as evidence of more metallic behavior .",
    "these features of the magnetism of na@xmath8coo@xmath1 need to be taken into consideration when assessing theories of the metallic state of this material .",
    "we have studied the low - energy region of the excitations in na@xmath2coo@xmath1 and revealed that the excitations are gapped . at low temperature",
    "the data were modelled best with a simple spin - wave model with two non - degenerate modes , providing evidence for both uniaxial and in - plane anisotropy in the compound .",
    "gaps from both modes were found to close at the bulk magnetization temperature @xmath3  k. we therefore conclude that the spin waves observed in na@xmath2coo@xmath1 are associated with the magnetic phase transition seen previously in magnetization data .",
    "furthermore , we have confirmed the a - type antiferromagnetic structure underlying these excitations by performing neutron diffraction measurements on na@xmath4coo@xmath1 in a large vertical applied magnetic field .",
    "a spin - flop transition occurs at @xmath131  t allowing measurement of the magnetic bragg peak at @xmath132 .",
    "the results support the assumption that the spins lie along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "we have calculated the field needed to overcome the anisotropy associated with the gap in the spin - wave dispersion and shown that it is in good agreement with the observed spin - flop transition field .",
    "we would like to thank a. hiess ( ill ) for his help with the rescal calculations .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the university of oxford and the engineering and physical sciences research council of great britain for financial support .",
