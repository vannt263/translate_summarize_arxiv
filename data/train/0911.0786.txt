    "in this note we address some features of the limiting behavior of the minimizers of a class of second - order singular perturbation energies . the model we analyze",
    "was introduced in @xmath15 by coleman and mizel in the context of the theory of second - order materials and was then studied in @xcite in collaboration with marcus .",
    "coleman and mizel proposed a model for nonlinear materials in which the free energy depends on both first and second order spatial derivatives of the mass density . in this way they expected to prove the occurrence of layered structures of the ground states ( as observed in concentrated soap solutions and metallic alloys ) without appealing to non - local energies ( such as , for example , the otha - kawasaki functional @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , they introduced the free - energy functional @xmath16 $ ] given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( the mass density ) is the order parameter of the system , @xmath19 and @xmath4 is a double - well potential with two potential wells of level zero at @xmath5 .",
    "as @xmath0 goes to zero , the functional accounts for the energy stored by a one - dimensional physical system occupying the bounded open interval @xmath20 .",
    "this model can be viewed as a scaled second - order landau expansion of the classical cahn - hillard model for sharp phase transition ; _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath21 for the cahn - hillard model the lack of uniqueness is usually solved in the context of first - order gradient theory of phase transitions considering the simplest diffuse phase transition model ; _ i.e. , _ the van der waals model .",
    "the latter is obtained by adding a singular gradient perturbation to the previous functional . after scaling , the new functional @xmath22",
    "$ ] reads as @xmath23 if @xmath8 grows at least linearly at infinity , modica and mortola @xcite proved that sequences @xmath24 with equi - bounded energy ( _ i.e. _  such that @xmath25 ) can not oscillate as , up to subsequences , they converge in @xmath26 to a function @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath9-limit of @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 for a suitable constant @xmath30 depending on the double - well potential @xmath8 .",
    "the above phenomenon characterizes first order phase transitions of every material having positive surface energy .",
    "on the other hand , in nature there are materials that relieve energy whenever the measure of their surface is increased .",
    "these materials have a so - called negative surface energy . to give a mathematical description of this kind of materials within the framework of the gradient theory of phase transitions , coleman and mizel introduced the energy @xmath14 .",
    "the requirement for an energy of the form of @xmath14 to be bounded from below forces the coefficient in front of the highest gradient squared to be nonnegative . on the other hand",
    "different phenomena can occur depending on the coefficient @xmath12 in front of @xmath31 . specifically , for negative constants @xmath12 , different authors showed that this model leads to the same asymptotic behavior of the first order perturbation , avoiding oscillations and converging to a sharp interface functional .",
    "the case @xmath32 was settled by hilhorst , peletier and schtzle in @xcite , where the authors proved that the functionals @xmath1 @xmath33-converge to a limit functional of type .",
    "the case @xmath34 was instead considered by fonseca and mantegazza . in @xcite",
    "the authors established the same limit behavior thanks to a compactness result for sequences with equi - bounded energy obtained exploiting some _ a priori _ bounds given by the growth assumption on the double - well potential @xmath8 and by a gagliardo - nirenberg interpolation inequality .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the case @xmath3 .",
    "the presence of a negative contribution due to the term involving the first order derivative makes the problem quite unusual in the context of higher - order models of phase transitions .",
    "in particular , since the three different terms in the energy are of the same order , their competition s outcomes strongly depend on the value of @xmath12 .",
    "heuristically , large values of @xmath12 make the phases highly unstable favoring oscillations between them and correspond to negative surface tensions .",
    "this was rigorously proved by mizel , peletier and troy in @xcite .",
    "the authors considered the classical potential @xmath35 and showed that , for @xmath36 , @xmath37 and that there exists a class of minimizers of @xmath1 which are non - constant periodic functions oscillating between the two potential wells .",
    "finer properties of these minimizers have been studied also in @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that analogous results have been obtained for the non - local perturbations of the van der waals model in one - dimensional space , as the already mentioned otha ",
    "kawasaki model ( see , for example , the forerunner study of mller @xcite in the context of coherent solid - solid phase transitions ) .",
    "these energies , when viewed as functionals of a suitable primitive of the order parameter of the system , become second - order functionals with a potential constraint on the first derivative , and lead to similar results .",
    "what was left open by the analysis carried out in @xcite is the case of `` small '' , positive constants @xmath12 .",
    "we prove here that , under the assumptions that the potential @xmath38 is quadratic in a neighborhood of the wells and grows at least as @xmath39 at infinity ( both hypothesis being necessary as discussed in section [ s : cpt ] ) , small values of @xmath12 make the phases stable and correspond to positive surface tensions ; _ i.e. , _ the asymptotic behavior of @xmath14 is again described by a sharp interface limit as in .",
    "the main difficulty in the achievement of the above result lies in the proof of a compactness theorem analog to the one obtained in the case of the modica ",
    "mortola functional . indeed , the negative term in the energy @xmath1 when @xmath3 gives no _ a priori _ bounds on minimizing sequences .",
    "here we solve this problem showing the existence of constants @xmath40 such that a new nonlinear interpolation inequality holds ( see lemma [ nonli ] ) : @xmath41 for every @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this inequality enables us to estimate from below our functionals with @xmath44 ( the one corresponding to @xmath34 ) for which the compactness result has been proved in @xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath7 every sequence of functions with equi - bounded energy @xmath1 converges in @xmath26 ( up to subsequences ) to a function @xmath45 ( see proposition [ comp2 ] ) .    on account of this result",
    ", we then complete the @xmath46-convergence analysis of the family of functionals @xmath14 by proving in theorem  [ glimit ] that , for every @xmath7 , the functionals @xmath1 @xmath9-converge to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is given by the following optimal profile problem ( whose solution s existence is part of the result ) , @xmath49    in the last part of the paper we address the problem of estimating the constants @xmath12 for which there are no oscillations in the asymptotic minimizers . in order to compare our results with those in @xcite ,",
    "we focus here on the explicit potential @xmath13 they considered . since the estimate we could derive for @xmath6 are very rough , in section [ sec : vs ] we investigate the following different problem , @xmath50 where for every interval @xmath51 and every @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the rayleigh quotient defined as @xmath54    problem is clearly related to the computation of the optimal constant in the nonlinear interpolation inequality and seems to be a challenging open problem .    clearly , for @xmath55 ,",
    "the minimizers exhibit an oscillating behavior .",
    "but , more importantly , we are able to show that , for @xmath56 , there are no oscillations , because of a @xmath57 compactness result in @xmath58 for sequences of functions equi - bounded in energy and having at least one zero of the first derivative ( see proposition [ comp - ottimale ] and notice that this condition is fulfilled by any sequence of functions which is supposed to oscillate ) . this compactness result , although analogous to the previous one provided for @xmath7 , is actually more difficult , because in this last case the energy is not everywhere positive , but can be in principle negative in a boundary layer ( see lemma [ interp - bordo ] ) .",
    "the benefit of this more refined compactness is that we can provide an upper bound and a lower bound on @xmath59 which have the same order of magnitude .",
    "the lower bound we obtain for @xmath59 follows by carefully tracing the constants in the linear interpolation inequality and amounts to @xmath60 ; the upper bound @xmath61 follows , instead , from a test with quadratic polynomials and gives an improved estimate with respect the one given in @xcite ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "what the present analysis does not still settle is a better understanding of the interpolation constants @xmath6 and @xmath59 .",
    "we conjecture , indeed , that for every @xmath63 the functionals @xmath14 do not develop microstructures and @xmath46-converge to a sharp interface functional of type up to an additive constant depending on the presence of possible boundary layers energies .",
    "similarly , we plan to address the analogous analysis in any space dimension in a future work ( see remark [ + d ] for the proof of the compactness in any dimension as a consequence of the one - dimensional result ) .",
    "in this section we set our notation and we recall some preliminary results we employ in the sequel .    with @xmath64 we always denote an open bounded interval and with @xmath65 two positive constants .",
    "moreover , we fix a class of double - well potentials with the following properties : @xmath66 is continuous , @xmath67 ( the location of the wells clearly can be fixed arbitrarily ) , and satisfies    * there exists @xmath68 such that @xmath69 for @xmath70 .    note that in particular the standard double - well potential @xmath13 belongs to this class .",
    "we consider the functionals @xmath14 defined in and , whenever the domain of integration is clear from the context , we simply write @xmath71 in place of @xmath72 . we denote by @xmath73 the functional introduced in @xcite ; that is @xmath74    as we heavily use it in the sequel , we recall here the statement of one of the main results of @xcite ( see ( * ? ? ? * proposition 2.7 ) ) .",

    "we then obtain the existence of the solution to the optimal profile problem for @xmath14 .      in this subsection",
