    "the detection of first - overtone carbon monoxide ( co ) emission near 2.3  in sn  1987a opened exciting new possibilities for the study of supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "unfortunately , for nearly a decade , sn  1987a remained the sole supernova with detected molecular emission .",
    "however , with the maturing of near - infrared ( nir ) spectrographs , observations of several sne in the late - time nebular phase have been made . as a result",
    ", co emission has now been detected in other type  ii supernovae : sn  1995ad @xcite , sn  1998s @xcite , sn  1998dl , and sn  1999em @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that molecule formation may be a common occurrence in type  ii sne",
    ".    the study of molecular emission in sne can provide valuable information about the composition , explosion dynamics , and the late - time temperature evolution and energy balance in the ejecta .",
    "for example , the detection of co formation can place constraints on the mixing in the sn ejecta . because co is quickly destroyed by the presence of ionized helium , the detection of co emission in a type  ii or ib supernova implies either that the co is not microscopically mixed with helium or that the helium is not ionized @xcite . in the case of a type  ic supernova",
    "there is likely little or no helium left in the outer envelope at the time of core collapse . as a result ,",
    "co emission in a type  ic does not place strong constraints on the mixing between ejecta layers .",
    "due to its very large number of collisionally excitable energy levels , co can be an important coolant of the sn ejecta .",
    "indeed , at temperatures of a few thousand k , co emission may be the dominant cooling mechanism @xcite .",
    "co cooling may , in turn , play a key role in dust formation in supernova ejecta .",
    "sn  1987a and sn  1998s , two supernovae with detected co emission , also showed strong evidence of dust formation in the ejecta . in sn",
    "1987a , thermal emission from dust was detected in the mid and far - infrared while , at the same time , line emission from the ejecta shifted to the blue ( @xcite , and references therein ) . similarly , late - time spectra of sn  1998s exhibited h and he lines with a multi - peak line profile , the red side of which faded dramatically with time , while the blue side remained nearly constant . in both cases ,",
    "the changes in line emission were attributed to the formation of dust in the ejecta , which obscured the far side of the supernova causing the redshifted emission to fade .    thermal emission from dust",
    "was also seen in sn  1998s @xcite , but this was not due to dust formation in the ejecta . in this case , the emission was likely from pre - existing dust in an extended cloud which was heated by x - rays and uv light from a strong interaction between the supernova and dense circumstellar gas @xcite .    analysis of near - infrared co emission can also provide information about the co - rich ejecta .",
    "for example , the overall shape of the co emission profile can be used as a temperature diagnostic for the co emitting gas ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the fine structure in the near - infrared is formed by transitions between different vibrational levels , with higher level transitions emitting at longer wavelengths .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the higher vibrational levels become de - populated and emission from the red end of the co profile decreases .    for high s / n data , it is possible to determine the velocity of the co emitting gas from the shape of the co profile @xcite . at low velocities , the band structure of the co emission",
    "is well defined and the blue edge of the emission profile is quite sharp .",
    "as the expansion velocity increases the bands blend together , smearing out the pattern of peaks and troughs .",
    "also , the short - wavelength end of the profile creeps farther toward the blue and the rise becomes progressively shallower .",
    "high velocity co can have important implications for the progenitor star . to accelerate a significant amount of co out to high velocity in a type  ii supernova",
    ", the progenitor must be massive ( @xmath0 for @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 ) and must have lost a large portion of its h and he rich mantle prior to core - collapse @xcite .",
    "the large progenitor mass is required to build up a large carbon / oxygen layer which will lie far enough out in the ejecta to accelerate to high velocity . in a smaller progenitor , the c / o rich layer will be buried too deeply beneath the outer mantle .    on the other hand , for stripped - envelope supernovae , where the pre - collapse mass loss becomes extreme , the requirement for a massive progenitor may be relaxed .",
    "for instance , in a type  ic supernova there is likely little or no mass left above the c / o rich layer and quite large c / o velocities might be expected from a fairly low mass progenitor .",
    "however , if the c / o velocity becomes too high , then the density might drop too fast for a significant amount of co to form .    here",
    "we present the first detection of co in a type  ic supernova , sn  2000ew . in   2 ,",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction . in",
    "  3 we present the data and compare the co emission observed in sn  2000ew to that seen in the nir spectrum of sn  1987a .",
    "we also discuss the conclusion of @xcite that both co emission and an unidentified feature seen in the spectrum of sn  1987a near 2.26  are ubiquitous features in the nir spectra of type  ii sne .",
    "sn  2000ew was discovered in ngc  3810 on 28 nov 2000 by t. puckett and a. langoussis with the puckett observatory 0.30-m automated supernova patrol telescope @xcite .",
    "sn  2000ew was originally classified as a type  ia supernova by @xcite , but was subsequently found to be of type  ic @xcite .    according to vsnet white light magnitude estimates",
    ", it reached a maximum of @xmath3 mag around 4 dec 2000 .",
    "the recession velocity of ngc  3810 , corrected for virgocentric infall , is 1053 km  s@xmath2 ( taken from the lyon - meuden extragalactic database . )",
    "using h@xmath4 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 @xcite yields an approximate distance to sn  2000ew of 15 mpc and implies a maximum light brightness of @xmath5 mag .",
    "this is somewhat faint for type  ic supernovae which typically show peak magnitudes around @xmath6 ",
    "@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however with the crudeness of our magnitude estimate it is difficult to determine if sn  2000ew is unusually sub - luminous or just on the faint end of the luminosity spectrum for type  ic sne .    on 5 mar 2001",
    ", we obtained a 1.92.5  spectrum of sn  2000ew using the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; @xcite ) on the 8.2  m subaru telescope .",
    "a 06 slit was used yielding a resolution of about 850 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the spectrum was collected in eight 400  s exposures dithered between two positions along the slit in an abba pattern .",
    "first order sky subtraction was obtained by subtracting ` b ' frames from ` a ' frames .",
    "1-d spectra were then extracted using standard iraf tasks .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated using an argon lamp spectrum obtained at the end of the night , and the calibration was tested by measuring the wavelengths of night - sky lines in the data .",
    "the data was corrected for telluric absorption using nearby av and gv stars selected from the gemini spectroscopic standard star catalogues .",
    "the g - dwarf was divided by a solar spectrum @xcite to remove stellar features .",
    "the result was used to correct for telluric absorption in the a dwarf spectrum .",
    "the stellar features were fit from the corrected a - star spectrum and removed from the raw a - star spectrum . the raw a - star spectrum with the stellar features removed was then used to correct the target data for telluric absorption .",
    "( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of this technique . )",
    "the instrumental response was removed by matching the observed spectra of the a - star telluric standards to model spectra from the stellar atmosphere calculations of @xcite .",
    "the absolute flux level was set using nir photometry taken a week later on 12 mar 2001 using tifkam @xcite on the 2.4  m hiltner telescope at mdm observatory .",
    "this night was not photometric and the sn brightness was measured relative to a field star 93  s and 26  e of the supernova .",
    "boot - strapping the nir photometry of this star from calibrated images taken in jan 2001 resulted in @xmath8 for sn  2000ew on 12 mar 2001 .",
    "this was then converted to flux units using the zero - points of @xcite , and the flux was set by matching the flux of the spectrum averaged over the combined filter and atmospheric bandpass of @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the absolute fluxing of the spectrum is accurate to 20% .",
    "figure  [ sn00ew_fig1 ] shows the full 1.92.5  spectrum of sn  2000ew on 5 mar 2001 , some 97 days after discovery and about 90 days after maximum light .",
    "the spectrum has been doppler shifted to remove the 993 km  s@xmath2 heliocentric radial velocity of ngc  3810 @xcite .",
    "strong emission from the first - overtone band of co is seen from 2.29  to the red end of the spectrum at 2.5  .",
    "the spectrum also shows three broad emission features near 1.94 , 1.98 and 2.22  .",
    "we identify the 1.94 and 1.98  features as emission from the 4p@xmath9p@xmath103d@xmath9d multiplet , and the 2.22  feature as 4s@xmath11s4p@xmath11p@xmath10 .",
    "these features were identified in the spectrum of sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "all three lines have a fwzi of about 4000 km  s@xmath2 , peak around 500 km  s@xmath2 and exhibit relatively boxy profiles that fade slightly from the blue to the red .",
    "in addition to these broad emission lines , the spectrum also contains two narrow emission features at 2.04 and 2.06  which we identify as [ ] 2.0466  and 2.0587  , respectively .",
    "both lines are unresolved and the narrowness of these features suggests that they are associated with circumstellar emission rather than supernova ejecta .",
    "both lines have been identified in clumps of dense circumstellar gas in the cas  a supernova remnant , along with two other lines in the spectral region covered here : 2.1661  ( br@xmath12 ) and [ ] 2.2244   @xcite .",
    "the latter [ ] line would be lost in the broad feature , but the br@xmath12 line lies in a relatively empty region of the spectrum and no trace of this line can be seen in our spectrum of sn  2000ew .",
    "this suggests that the circumstellar clumps detected here may be hydrogen poor , perhaps originating in the he mantle of the progenitor star and shed prior to core - collapse .",
    "such an interpretation is consistent with the general picture that type  ic progenitors shed a substantial portion of their helium rich mantle prior to core collapse ( @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the lack of hydrogen emission also suggests that the narrow lines are not associated with a background region or other ism gas in the host galaxy .",

    "( 1998 ) ;    @xcite have concluded that co formation is common in type  ii supernovae . with the discovery of co in the type  ic event",
    "sn  2000ew , we have the first evidence that this conclusion might be extended to include core - collapse supernovae in general .",

    "furthermore , it may be that the three non - detections were simply not observed at a late enough epoch .",
    "the results in table  [ sn00ew_tab1 ] suggest that co tends to form around 100200 days , and none of the three objects without detections were observed past 100 days .",
    "a quantitative analysis of co emission in sne requires a good understanding of the chemical and kinematic structure of the ejecta , as well as detailed modeling of the co formation , destruction , and excitation processes .",
    "( e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "unfortunately , such an analysis for sn  2000ew requires more information than is available in our single spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the s / n of the data does not place strong constraints on the fine - structure in the co bands",
    ". we will therefore restrict ourselves to a very basic analysis of the co emission along with a comparison to the spectrum observed in sn  1987a .",
    "the shape of the co profile provides a lower limit on the temperature of the emitting region .",
    "lte modeling of co has shown that for temperatures below about 2000  k , the first two bandheads have comparable strengths , but higher order bandheads are down by at least 2030% @xcite .",
    "this creates a noticeable break in the spectrum redward of the second bandhead near 2.32 .",
    "since no break is evident in the spectrum of sn  2000ew , we conclude that the temperature is at least 2000  k in the co emitting region .",
    "it is useful to compare the observed co emission in sn  2000ew with the much higher s / n co detection in sn  1987a .",
    "figure  [ sn00ew_fig2 ] shows the co emission from sn  1987a on day 192 @xcite overplotted on our spectrum of sn  2000ew .",
    "the sn  1987a data have been shifted vertically and scaled to match the continuum and co brightness of sn  2000ew .",
    "both spectra are plotted in the rest frame of the host galaxy .",
    "longward of 2.28  , the sn  2000ew data matches the sn  1987a data fairly well .",
    "the bandhead structure is not visible in sn  2000ew but this is likely due to the low s / n of the sn  2000ew detection rather than velocity smearing .",
    "in fact , the blue edge of the co feature in sn  2000ew matches that in sn  1987a quite well , suggesting that the co has a similar velocity in both objects : @xmath13 km  s@xmath2 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    while a 2000 km  s@xmath2 co velocity is not unexpected for a type  ii supernova like sn  1987a , it is quite low for some hydrodynamic models of type  ic sne .",
    "spherically symmetric hydrodynamic explosion models of the type  ic sn  1994i predict a minimum velocity for the c / o rich layer of around 7000 km  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "for such a model to be consistent with an observed co velocity of 2000 km  s@xmath2 would require a kinetic energy release well below @xmath14 erg .    on the other hand , the low co velocity may be consistent with strongly non - spherical jet - driven explosion models . in the asymmetric explosion models used by @xcite to analyse the type  ic hypernova sn  1998bw , ejecta velocities are large along the jet , but much more modest perpendicular to the jet axis . in their @xmath15 erg model",
    ", the c / o rich gas has a minimum velocity around 3000 km  s@xmath2 . with",
    "a lower kinetic energy release such a model might be able to account for the low co velocities observed in sn  2000ew .      as shown in figure  [ sn00ew_fig2 ]",
    ", sn  1987a exhibited an emission feature peaked near 2.265  which is absent in the sn  2000ew spectrum .",

    "@xcite identify the feature as co@xmath16 but detailed models of co chemistry in sn  1987a have ruled out this identification @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this feature did not evolve with the co bands in sn  1987a , remaining visible long after the co emission had faded @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite , hereafter slg ) suggest that the sn  1987a feature is `` ubiquitous '' in type  ii supernovae and must be accounted for when measuring the velocity of co emission .",
    "however , the presence of this 2.26  feature in other supernovae is somewhat uncertain .",
    "detections have been reported for sn  1995ad @xcite , sn  1998dl , and sn  1999em ( slg ) . however , in all three cases the purported detections are not clear features , but rather apparent excesses of emission above the continuum level which depend critically on where the continuum baseline is defined in these low s / n spectra . furthermore , this feature is not seen in the co spectrum of the type  iip sn  1999gi ( gerardy & fesen 2002 , in prep . ) nor is it seen in our co spectrum of sn  2000ew , which otherwise shows many similarities to sn  1987a and other type  ii sne .",
    "as evidence of the presence of the 2.26  sn  1987a feature in other sne , slg reported that this feature was blended with the blue edge of the co feature in the 20 june 1998 spectrum of sn  1998s presented by @xcite ( hereafter gfhw ) .",
    "slg referenced figure  6 of gfhw which is reproduced here as figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "this figure shows the co detection of sn  1998s with that of sn  1987a overplotted .",
    "the sn  1987a spectrum has been shifted vertically and scaled to approximately match the continuum level and co brightness of the sn  1998s spectrum , and the wavelengths of both spectra have been shifted to the rest frame of the supernovae . near 2.4",
    "the sn  1998s spectrum is somewhat fainter than the sn  1987a .",
    "gfhw express some concern that this may be due to residual telluric absorption in the data .",
    "if real , the steeper profile is indicative of a somewhat lower temperature in sn  1998s compared to sn  1987a .",
    "both spectra show excess emission to the blue of the co rise near 2.8  .",
    "gfhw interpret the emission as the extended blue wing of a high velocity co profile , but admit that there may be an unidentified line contributing to this emission .",
    "they noted that the emission can not be due to the 2.26  feature as that feature appears farther to the blue in sn  1987a .",
    "slg reached the opposite conclusion , stating that the emission in sn  1998s was the same feature as that seen in sn  1987a , and attributed the difference in wavelength to the different recession velocities of the supernovae .",
    "however , since both spectra in figure  [ fig3 ] ( and figure  6 of gfhw ) have been doppler shifted to the supernova rest frame , we do not agree with their conclusion .",
    "a sn  1998s spectrum obtained by @xcite casts further doubt on the presence of this 2.26  feature . in their spectrum",
    "taken one day before that of gfhw they find little excess emission blueward of the sharp edge of the co bands and suggest that the differences between the two spectra are largely due to noise .",
    "consequently , we suggest that the sn  1987a feature is not ubiquitous , and may in fact be relatively rare , with sn  1987a remaining the only unambiguous detection of this feature .",
    "we have presented _ k_-band spectra of the type  ic sn  2000ew which shows strong first - overtone emission of carbon monoxide .",
    "this is the sixth core - collapse supernova for which a co detection has been published and it is the first detection in a non - type  ii supernova .",
    "the spectrum also shows narrow emission lines of [ ] and but is conspicuously lacking narrow ( br@xmath12 ) emission .",
    "we interpret this emission as coming from dense clumps of hydrogen - poor circumstellar gas .",
    "@xcite have concluded that co formation probably occurs in all type  ii supernovae .",
    "we present a table listing ten core - collapse sne for which _",
    "k_-band spectra were obtained , seven of which show co emission .",
    "co emission was typically first observed between 100 and 200  d , and the three sne without co detections were not observed past 100  d.    the detection of co in the type  ic sn  2000ew provides the first indication that co formation may also be common in stripped - envelope core - collapse sne ( types ib , ic , and `` iib '' ) .",
    "the observed co emission profile in sn  2000ew is quite similar to that of sn  1987a , and indicates an expansion velocity around 2000 km  s@xmath2 , which is surprisingly low for a type  ic supernova .",
    "the low observed co velocity may be another indication that strongly non - spherical explosion models are needed for type  ic sne .    to date",
    ", there have been no observations that provide strong evidence for high velocity co emission .",
    "an apparent blue wing in the co spectrum of sn  1998s presented by gfhw might be due to high velocity co. however a coeval spectrum taken by @xcite does nt show this blue extension to the co profile and they derive a much lower co velocity from their observations .",
    "thus the co velocity in sn  1998s is uncertain . in all of the other co detections , the observed velocity is around 2000 km  s@xmath2 or lower .",
    "it could be that a low c / o velocity is a requirement for co formation .",
    "co formation is a highly density sensitive process , and it is possible that in higher velocity gas the density decreases too fast to allow much co to form .",
    "however , for most type  ii supernovae , the c / o rich layers are buried too deep in the ejecta to expect co velocities much higher than 2000 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "looking for co emission in type  ib / c supernovae will provide a better test as much higher c / o velocities are expected in these objects .",
    "we find no evidence in sn  2000ew for the presence of a 2.26  feature seen in sn  1987a and , contrary to @xcite , we suspect it is either faint or absent in other type  ii and type  ib / c objects . sn  1987a remains the only clear detection of this feature , and its identification remains a mystery .",

    "<S> the detection of co in sn  2000ew provides further evidence that molecule formation may be a common occurrence in core - collapse supernova ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum also contains narrow emission lines of [ ] and  probably from dense clumps of hydrogen - poor circumstellar gas surrounding sn  2000ew . </S>",
    "<S> our spectrum of sn  2000ew shows no trace of an unidentified feature seen near 2.26  , just blueward of the co emission , in the spectrum of sn  1987a and we discuss proposed detections of this feature in other type  ii supernovae . </S>"
