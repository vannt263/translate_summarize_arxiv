    "at high temperatures the spontaneously broken symmetry of electroweak interactions is restored @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the higgs mechanism of symmetry breaking , and the corresponding phase transition is an intriguing aspect of electroweak interactions .",
    "it is also of great cosmological importance since at temperatures of order the critical temperature of the phase transition baryon - number violating processes fall out of thermal equilibrium @xcite . as a result",
    ", the present cosmological baryon asymmetry is finally determined at the electroweak phase transition .",
    "theoretical descriptions of the phase transition start from the finite - temperature effective potential whose local minima yield the free energy of states with a homogeneous higgs field given by the position of the local minimum ( cf .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to evaluate the effective potential in perturbation theory @xcite-@xcite where , due to infrared divergences , a useful expansion is only obtained after a resummation of an infinite number of terms .",
    "alternatively , interesting first results have been obtained by lattice monte carlo simulations @xcite-@xcite , reduced three - dimensional action @xcite and by using an average action at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the decay of a metastable homogeneous state involves `` critical droplets '' and therefore inhomogeneous field configurations . the free energy of these configurations is usually estimated based on an effective action which is the sum of the finite - temperature effective potential and the canonical kinetic term of the higgs field .",
    "we will improve this approximation by evaluating the finite - temperature wave function correction terms of the su(2)-higgs model to one - loop order .",
    "this will allow us to determine the range of higgs boson masses for which the derivative expansion of the effective action is reliable .",
    "following langer s theory of metastability @xcite we evaluate the decay rate in the semiclassical approximation where one starts from some approximate `` coarse - grained '' effective action and expands around its saddle point interpolating between the symmetric and the broken phase . for finite - temperature quantum field theories the `` coarse - grained '' effective action is frequently approximated by the one - loop effective potential together with canonical kinetic terms for the scalar fields . the callan - coleman theory for the decay of the false vacuum at zero temperature in four dimensions @xcite",
    "is then applied to the effective three - dimensional theory at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "one problem , which points to some inconsistency of this approximation , is that the occuring effective potential is in general complex .",
    "the origin of this problem in the calculation of the decay rate is the incorrect treatment of the scalar fluctuations which appear twice , as contribution to the effective potential and as fluctuations around the saddle point .",
    "instead , one has to split the functional integration into two parts , such that the first one yields a `` coarse - grained '' effective action which has a barrier between the symmetric and the broken phase . in the second part a perturbative expansion is then performed around the non - trivial saddle point , and only here long wave length scalar fluctuations appear . in this spirit , in @xcite the integration over the vector fields has been performed in the first step . the same approach has been followed in @xcite for the analogous problem of the coleman - weinberg model at zero temperature , in citebfhw for nonabelian gauge theories and in @xcite for yukawa models at finite temperature . here",
    "we will further improve these calculations by integrating in the first step also over the components of the scalar fields with non - zero matsubara frequencies .",

    "hence , for the allowed range of couplings determined from the effective potential corrections due to the @xmath36-factors can be treated as perturbation .",

    "hence , higher order terms in the derivative expansion are non - negligible as we shall see in the following section , a more careful treatment nevertheless confirms the above conclusion on the size of the wave function correction terms .",
    "at temperatures below the critical temperature @xmath28 the symmetric phase becomes metastable and decays via nucleation and growth of droplets of the broken phase . in condensed matter physics",
    "a theory for the decay of such metastable states has been developed by langer many years ago @xcite .",

    "this is justified because the characteristic time scales of the microscopic processes ( e.g. , @xmath58 scattering ) are several orders of magnitude smaller than the time needed for the phase transition .",
    "thus , the langer theory is applicable , and it is sufficient to use a stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation .    the non - trivial phase structure of the higgs models at finite temperature becomes only apparent if quantum fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "the tree - level potential possesses only a single local minimum at @xmath59 .",
    "this is analogous to the case of coleman - weinberg symmetry breaking by radiative corrections . in order to obtain the decay rate one first has to integrate out degrees of freedom which generate the barrier between the symmetric and the broken phase and only then , in a second step ,",
    "determine the interpolating saddle point .",
    "in @xcite it has been suggested to first integrate out the vector field .",
    "the same route has been followed in the abelian higgs model at zero temperature and coleman - weinberg symmetry breaking @xcite .",
