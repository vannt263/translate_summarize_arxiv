    "since the discovery of the first brown dwarfs ( nakajima et al@xmath6 @xcite ; rebolo , zapatero osorio , & martn @xcite ) , with masses below the hydrogen burning mass limit ( kumar @xcite ; grossman , hays , & graboske @xcite ; burrows et al .",
    "@xcite ; dantona & mazzitelli @xcite ) , many efforts have been devoted to study their physical properties and formation processes . the frequency and characteristics of binary and multiple brown dwarf systems and brown dwarf ",
    "star pairs may provide key information on stellar / substellar / planetary formation . with the advent of new ground - based observational techniques , like the adaptive optics and coronography , and the high spatial resolution imaging capability of the hubble space telescope , it has been possible to resolve very low mass companions around stars and binary brown dwarfs ( e.g. , martn , brandner , & basri @xcite ; close et al@xmath6 @xcite , @xcite ; potter et al@xmath6 @xcite ; burgasser et al@xmath6 @xcite ; gizis et al@xmath6 @xcite ; mccaughrean et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "one spectroscopic binary brown dwarf has also been discovered in the young pleiades open cluster ( basri & martn @xcite ) .",
    "all these surveys indicate that substellar binaries are not rare , and that brown dwarfs are commonly found in orbit around low mass stars .",
    "these are rather nearby systems ; the visual binary brown dwarfs known so far typically present projected separations between 0.9 and @xmath110au ( orbital periods of 330yr or larger ) , permitting orbital mapping over the coming decades .",
    "eclipsing binaries have often served as valuable tools for the validation of structure and evolutionary models ( e.g. , delfosse et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "accurate substellar mass , radius and luminosity measurements provide a crucial test of our understanding of substellar physics . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no eclipsing brown dwarfs are identified so far . in the absence of eclipsing substellar systems , nearby visual brown dwarf",
    "pairs become benchmark objects to evaluate theoretical models in the substellar mass regime , because astrometric and spectroscopic studies will yield highly accurate dynamical masses of the components , although the majority of these binaries tends to have long orbital periods .",
    "the binary gj569bab is one of the very low mass pairs with the shortest periods known to date ( 2.4yr , lane et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "it can be used to calibrate state - of - the - art evolutionary isochrones .",
    "gj569bab is a binary dwarf moving around the chromospherically active m2.5v - type star gj569a ( hipparcos distance of 9.8pc , perryman et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of a `` single '' , very red , proper motion companion at a separation of 5  from the primary star was first reported by forrest , skrutskie , & shure @xcite .",
    "follow - up low - resolution spectroscopy obtained by henry & kirkpatrick @xcite confirmed its cool nature ( it was classified as an m8.5v dwarf ) .",
    "martn et al@xmath6 @xcite resolved the companion into two separate objects ( gj569ba and gj569bb ) using adaptive optics ( ao ) observations with the keckii telescope .",
    "more recently , we obtained ao images and low - resolution spectra of each of the components ( lane et al@xmath6 @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) , which have allowed us to determine the astrometric orbital parameters of the binary ( see table  [ astrometry ] ) and the spectral types of gj569ba ( m8.5v ) and gj569bb ( m9v ) .",
    "similar astrometric results obtained from speckle interferometry were also reported by kenworthy et al@xmath6 @xcite . in this paper , we present high - resolution spectra of the resolved components obtained at different orbital epochs and the derivation of the dynamical masses of gj569ba and bb . for the first time , one brown dwarf is unambiguosly confirmed without any theoretical model .",
    "this has allowed us to carry out a critical evaluation of substellar evolutionary model predictions .",
    "in addition to the astrometry presented in paper  i , we have observed the binary gj569bab on two more occasions on 2001 jun 28 and sep 01 . we used the 10-m keck ii ao facility ( wizinowich et al@xmath6 @xcite ) , and the slit - viewing camera ( scam ) associated with the nirspec instrument ( mclean et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "the pixel scale of the 256@xmath7256 rockwell hgcdte array of scam was 00168 .",
    "exposures were taken in the @xmath8-band .",
    "the observational strategy , data reduction , and the analysis of the astrometry are all described in paper  i. we list in table  [ astrometry ] the most recent relative positions of gj569bb with respect gj569ba as a function of the modified julian date ( mjd ) .",
    "these new astrometric data along with the previous astrometry allow us to determine the orbit of gj569bab to a certain degree of accuracy by fitting a keplerian model . a description of the procedure by which the best keplerian solution is obtained is fully detailed in paper  i. the updated best - fit parameters and their 1@xmath9 uncertainties are given in table  [ orbit ] ( columns 2 and  3 ) , where we also provide the previous measurements for comparison ( columns 4 and  5 ) .",
    "the agreement is excellent , and the new and `` old '' values are very similar within the error bars .",
    "we note that the uncertainties of the updated parameters are reduced as compared to paper  i. this suggests that the relative orbit of the gj569bab pair is now determined to a high degree of confidence .",
    "the visual fit orbit is shown together with all the available astrometry in fig .",
    "[ orbiteps ] .",
    "it is important to note that the astrometric solution of the orbit in paper  i has an ambiguity of 180@xmath10 in the determination of the position angle of the ascending node , @xmath11 .",
    "this parameter sets how the plane of the orbit points in or out of the plane of the sky . from purely positional measurements we are able to identify the two nodes of the orbit , but it is not known which is the ascending node .",
    "because the argument of periapsis , @xmath12 , is measured from the position of the ascending node , it also shares a similar ambiguity .",
    "this uncertainty does not affect the determination of the other orbital parameters or the total mass of the binary , and is only removed with spectroscopic data .",
    "the radial velocities that we have measured for the gj569bab system ( section  [ velocities ] ) confirm that the angle of the node published in paper  i corresponds to the position of the descending node . in column 2 of table  [ orbit ]",
    "we provide the correct mean values for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    from the updated astrometric orbit of the pair ,",
    "the best - fit values of the period and semi - major axis correspond to a total mass of 0.125@xmath4  with a 3@xmath9 uncertainty of @xmath130.015@xmath4 .",
    "this is a purely keplerian dynamical result , and no evolutionary models are involved in the calculations .",
    "the 3@xmath9 upper mass limit of gj569bab is 0.140@xmath4 .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , the similarity of the photometric and spectroscopic properties between gj569ba and bb suggests that the mass ratio , @xmath5 , of the pair is close to equal .",
    "this sets the 3@xmath9 upper mass limit of the smallest object to be 0.070@xmath4  ( 0.065@xmath4  at 1@xmath9 ) , and the lower mass limit of the largest object to be 0.055@xmath4  ( 0.060@xmath4  at 1@xmath9 ) .",
    "magazz , martn & rebolo  @xcite did not detect lithium in the optical spectrum of gj569bab .",
    "their data are dominated by the more massive component , which is brighter .",
    "theoretical models ( e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "@xcite ; baraffe et al .",
    "@xcite ) predict that objects more massive than 0.055@xmath4  have efficiently depleted their atmospheric lithium at ages older than a few hundred million years . in this sense ,",
    "models and our observations appear to be in agreement .",
    "we will discuss lithium in each component of the binary in a forthcoming paper . to investigate further the reliability of the models , we must know the individual masses of gj569ba and bb .",
    "the radial velocity measurements of section  [ velocities ] shall constrain better the mass of each component , providing a better estimate of @xmath5 .",
    "we have obtained @xmath14-band spectra with the keck ii telescope , the ao correcting system , and nirspec , a cross - dispersed , cryogenic echelle spectrometer employing a 1024@xmath71024 aladdin insb array detector .",
    "these observations were carried out on four different occasions within the same orbital period during 2001 ; three of them coincide with astrometric observations . in the echelle mode , we selected the nirspec-3 ( @xmath14 ) filter , and an entrance slit width of 043 ( i.e , 3 pixels along the dispersion direction of the detector ) .",
    "the length of the slit was 12 .",
    "for the present study we used only the spectral order that covers the following wavelength range : 1.24001.2575@xmath15 m .",
    "this instrumental setup provided a nominal dispersion of 0.179pix@xmath16 ( 4.3kmpix@xmath16 ) , and a final resolution of 0.55 , which corresponds to a resolving power @xmath0@xmath122500 at 1.2485@xmath15 m .",
    "the journal of observations is given in table  [ spectroscopy ] and shows the observing dates , exposure times and the air mass range of the observations .",
    "the slit was aligned with gj569ba and gj569bb so that the two objects were observed simultaneously .",
    "spectra were collected at two different positions along the entrance slit . in order to remove atmospheric telluric absorptions , the near - infrared featureless stars hr5567 ( a0v ) , hr5931 ( a0v ) and sao101508 ( f8iii ) were observed very close in time and in air mass ( within 0.1 air masses ) .",
    "white - light spectra obtained with the same instrumental configuration were used for flat - fielding the target data .",
    "the dispersion solutions for the may , june and september data were derived from the arc lamp lines of ar , kr , and xe , which were systematically taken after observing gj569 .",
    "no calibrating arc lamps were observed in august .",
    "raw spectra were reduced following conventional techniques in the near - infrared and using the redspec software , which was particularly designed at the university of california for the analysis of nirspec data .",
    "we also reduced and extracted spectra using the packages twodspec and onedspec within the iraf environment , obtaining very similar results .",
    "nodded images were subtracted to remove sky background and dark current .",
    "we selected different apertures to extract the individual spectra ( between 4 and 6 pixels for gj569bb , and between 4 and 8 pixels for gj569ba ) .",
    "figure  [ apertures ] shows the cut along the spatial direction of one of our two - dimension spectra . as can be seen from the location and distribution of the apertures in the figure ,",
    "the cross - contamination between the extracted data of the two components is less than @xmath110%  ( except for the september data ) .",
    "we have checked that the relative radial velocity measurements obtained for the various apertures are consistent with each other within the error bars ( see discussion of sect@xmath6 [ velocities ] ) .",
    "larger extraction apertures are useless for radial velocity measurements because the spectrum of each component of the binary is significantly contaminated by the presence of the companion . extracted spectra were divided by normalized flat - fields , and calibrated in wavelength .",
    "the 1@xmath9 dispersion of the fourth - order polynomial fit was 0.02  ( 3.6%  of the final resolution ) .",
    "we also removed some fringing that is internal to nirspec and appears sometimes when using this instrument behind the ao system .",
    "the spectra of hot stars were used for division into the corresponding science spectra .",
    "these stars do not show any intrinsic atmospheric feature in the spectral coverage of the echelle order at 1.2485@xmath15 m . finally , we multiplied the science spectra by the black body spectrum for the temperatures of 9480k and 11200k , which corresponds to the a0v and f8iii classes , respectively ( allen @xcite ) .",
    "the final spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "no heliocentric or radial velocity corrections have been applied .",
    "the august data are not displayed because they lack a reliable wavelength calibration .",
    "the most noticeable spectral features are due to the absorption ki resonance doublet at 1.2436 and 1.2526@xmath15 m .",
    "the spectrum of the early m - type star gj569a shows narrow atomic lines and no other relevant features are apparent .",
    "however , the ki lines of the late - m dwarfs gj569ba and c appear quite broad , as expected for rather cool atmospheres .",
    "we note that these atomic lines are moderately stronger in gj569bb than in ba , which is indicative of the slightly cool nature of the smallest object .",
    "many other absorption features are likely due to h@xmath17o , tio , feh and crh , as discussed in sect@xmath6  [ synthetic ] .",
    "there are clear advantages in determining radial velocities from the spectra of fig .",
    "[ spectra ] . on the one hand , this wavelength interval is almost completely free of strong earth s telluric absorption lines that might introduce uncertainties in the doppler shift calculation .",
    "there are a few of these telluric lines in the red part of the spectra . nevertheless , we are confident that the science spectra have good cancellation of these terrestrial atmospheric features .",
    "in addition , the wavelength solution of the spectral order at 1.2485@xmath15 m is reliable because it is based on seven arc lamp lines distributed all across the dispersion axis of the detector .",
    "finally , the science spectra have relatively good signal - to - noise ratio at these wavelengths , and display numerous characteristic features that may yield accurate radial velocity measurements .",
    "the doppler shifts of gj569bb were determined by a fourier cross - correlation technique , using the spectrum of gj569ba as a template .",
    "the relative velocities of gj569bb cross - correlated against gj569ba obtained for the four observing nights are given in the second column of table  [ vrad ] . according to the measurements",
    ", gj569bb is moving toward us , while gj569ba is moving further away at the time of the observations .",
    "this has allowed us to determine unambiguosly the position of the ascending node angle of the orbit of the pair ( table  [ orbit ] ) .",
    "we have measured the observed radial velocities of each component from the centroids of the ki lines , obtained by marking two continuum points around the lines and fitting the profiles within iraf .",
    "these velocities were corrected for the rotation of the earth , the motion of the earth about the earth - moon barycenter , and the orbit of the barycenter about the sun to yield heliocentric radial velocities , which are listed in columns 3 and 4 of table  [ vrad ] .",
    "heliocentric velocities can not be derived from the august data because the spectra lack a reliable wavelength calibration .",
    "the precision of all the velocities may be judged by the standard deviation of the measurements for different regions of the spectra .",
    "the cross - correlation technique was able to achieve precisions of about 1/4 pixel ( an accuracy of the order of @xmath131.1kms@xmath16 ) for good signal - to - noise data .",
    "the velocity accuracy became a factor of 1.5 to 2 worse when analizing the data of gj569bb , because this object is fainter than gj569ba and its spectra show lower signal - to - noise ratios ( fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) .",
    "similar uncertainties are affecting the radial velocities derived from the centroids of the atomic lines .",
    "we have measured the heliocentric velocity of the star gj569a using its 2001 june spectrum , and have found it to be @xmath188.0@xmath131.1kms@xmath16 .",
    "various authors have investigated the velocity variability of gj569a during the last two decades , concluding that this is a rather stable star over a period of ten years with a mean heliocentric velocity of @xmath187.17@xmath130.28kms@xmath16 ( marcy , lindsay & wilson @xcite ; marcy & benitz @xcite ) , @xmath188.6@xmath131.0kms@xmath16 ( barbier - brossat & figon @xcite ) , and @xmath187.2@xmath130.4kms@xmath16 ( nidever et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "our measurement and its error bar are in agreement with the values seen in the literature .",
    "we are confident that the velocities of table  [ vrad ] are accurate to the claimed uncertainties .      by comparing our observed spectra to synthetic energy distributions",
    ", we can obtain information on the atmospheric temperatures , gravities and rotation of gj569ba and bb .",
    "theoretical spectra were computed in a classical framework , i.e. , assuming lte , plane - parallel media , and no sinks and sources of energy in the atmosphere .",
    "we used the wita6 code ( pavlenko @xcite ) , which takes into account a total of 100 species .",
    "the equations of ionisation - dissociation equilibrium were solved for a plasma made of neutral atoms , ions and molecules .",
    "the constants of the formulas for chemical balance were taken from tsuji @xcite and gurvitz et al@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "line lists come from different sources , depending on the species .",
    "atomic line lists were taken from vald ( kupka et al@xmath6 @xcite ) , lines of tio from plez @xcite , cn from kurucz @xcite , crh and feh from burrows et al@xmath6 @xcite and dulick et al@xmath6 @xcite , respectively , and h@xmath17o from partrige & schwenke @xcite .",
    "the partition function of h@xmath17o was computed as in pavlenko @xcite to properly account for the splitting of the lines .",
    "we adopted the voigt profile for the shape of each molecular and atomic line ; the damping constants were computed using data from the original databases , and if no values were published , computed following an approximation of unsld @xcite . due to the low temperatures of the atmospheres of late - m dwarfs , stark broadening may be discarded , whereas pressure broadening prevails .",
    "a grid of 20 synthetic spectra was computed for solar metallicity , dusty model atmospheres of allard et al@xmath6  @xcite , effective temperatures , @xmath19 , of 2600 , 2400 , 2300 , 2000k , and gravities log@xmath20=4.0 , 4.5 , 5.0 , 5.5 , 6.0 ( cms@xmath21 ) .",
    "we have also computed grids for the cond model atmospheres of allard et al@xmath6  @xcite , and the very recent ucm models of tsuji @xcite for the critical temperature of 1800k .",
    "the three sets of models differ in the treatment of dust ( see the references above ) .",
    "late - m and early - l dwarfs are supposed to have dusty upper atmospheres , with dust particles affecting the thermal structure . hence , the cond models , which assume a complete dust - segregation , are not a good approximation for the case of gj569bab .",
    "theoretical spectra were obtained in the wavelength range of our observations , with wavelength step of 0.5 , and with microturbulent velocity of 2kms@xmath16 .",
    "element abundances are as in anders & grevesse @xcite .",
    "the contributions of various molecular and atomic species to the total opacity in the 1.24001.2575@xmath2 spectral region are shown in fig@xmath6  [ species ] , from which we see the absorption due to ki dominates .",
    "the remaining features of the observed spectra are likely due to h@xmath17o , crh and feh .",
    "however , the absorption at 1.2462@xmath2 does not appear to have a counterpart in any of the molecular data of the figure .",
    "the effect of changing @xmath19 and log@xmath20 in our computations is shown in fig@xmath6  [ theory ] .",
    "we note that crh was excluded from our final synthetic spectra , because it appears too strong in the spectral region of the figure ( see fig@xmath6  [ species ] ) .",
    "our spectroscopic data are better reproduced by computations that do not include the opacities of this molecule . as seen from fig@xmath6  [ theory ] , temperature has a relatively larger impact on the energy distributions than has gravity .",
    "it is also obvious that the ki lines are remarkably sensitive to both temperature and gravity , i.e. , the doublet becomes systematically weaker at high temperatures and low gravities ( e.g. , see mcgovern et al@xmath6 @xcite ) , while the main molecular species at these wavelengths do not appear to change notably with gravity .",
    "this justifies the use of the ki atomic lines to estimate the surface gravity of gj569ba and bb .",
    "our observed spectra have been compared to the various grids of synthetic data , which were computed including the broadening of the alkali lines due to van der waals collisions with h and h@xmath17 ( important in cool , neutral atmospheres ) .",
    "the van der waals treatment is an approximation applicable to the ki doublet at 1.25@xmath2 , because these are weak lines ( e.g. , burrows , marley , & sharp @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison has been performed as in jones et al@xmath6 @xcite , pavlenko & jones @xcite and pavlenko et al@xmath6 @xcite . the analysis procedure described by these authors",
    "is based on a minimization technique that provides the best - fit @xmath19 , log@xmath20 and @xmath22sin@xmath23 ( line broadening due to atmospheric rotation ) , where @xmath23 is the inclination angle of the rotation axis .",
    "of the three sets of model atmospheres , the dusty models yield the smallest values of the minimization function .",
    "the best - fit parameters are as follows : for both gj569ba and bb , @xmath19=2400k and log@xmath20=4.5 ( dusty models ) , and @xmath19=2500k and log@xmath20=4.5 ( ucm models ) .",
    "tsuji s @xcite models provide higher @xmath19 because they predict lower temperatures at the atmospheric layers where lines are produced .",
    "a plot depicting the ( @xmath19 , log@xmath20 ) contours of the minimization function is shown in fig@xmath6  [ minima ] , and fig@xmath6  [ bestfitspectra ] displays the best - fit synthetical spectra together with the observed data .",
    "we note that while the alkali lines are nicely reproduced by the theoretical data , the molecular absorptions are not well matched by the computations .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have a reference slow - rotator spectrum ( of similar spectral type and observed with the same instrumentation ) to measure the rotational velocities of gj569ba and bb .",
    "the fitting technique of pavlenko et al@xmath6 @xcite provides estimates for these velocities . despite the unknown inclination angles of the two objects , our spectral analysis suggests that gj569ba and bb are fast rotators , with ba ( @xmath22sin@xmath23@xmath137@xmath1315kms@xmath16 ) possibly rotating slightly faster than bb ( @xmath22sin@xmath23@xmath130@xmath1315kms@xmath16 ) .",
    "we note that there is a large uncertainty associated to these measurements , mainly due to the poor knowledge of the molecular opacities and the uncertainty in the @xmath19 determination , which is about 100k .",
    "a moderately cooler temperature than that of gj569ba and a similarly high rotational velocity may explain the ki lines broadening and the dissimilarities of gj569bb .",
    "these rapid velocities are not surprising since many field low - mass stars and brown dwarfs display high values of @xmath22sin@xmath23 as indicated by the spectroscopic measurements of basri & marcy @xcite , tinney & reid @xcite , basri @xcite and reid et al@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "according to evolutionary models ( e.g. , baraffe et al@xmath6 @xcite ) , the radius expected for 0.0600.070@xmath4  brown dwarfs is in the range 0.1300.092@xmath24 for ages between 300 and 1000myr .",
    "this would imply short rotation periods between 3sin@xmath23 and 5sin@xmath23 hours .",
    "some field and cluster brown dwarfs of similar spectral classes have been identified with such rapid rotations , like kelu1 ( 1.8h , clarke , tinney , & covey @xcite ) , and sori27 , sori28 and sori45 of the @xmath9orionis cluster ( 2.8 , 3.3 and @xmath13h , respectively , caballero et al@xmath6 @xcite ; zapatero osorio et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "because the rotation velocities of gj569ba and bb appear to be different , and assuming that both objects might have similar inclination rotation angles , it is unlikely that the two components are tidally pseudo - synchronized ( i.e. , the angular velocity of rotation is similar to the angular velocity of the companion crossing the sky during periastron passage ) .",
    "this contrasts with the case of the pleiades member ppl15 ( 120myr ) , which is , to the best of our knowledge , so far the only known spectroscopic binary brown dwarf ( basri & martn @xcite ) .",
    "the rotation of each of the components is similar and slow ( 10kms@xmath16 ) , suggesting that the two objects are tidally pseudo - synchronized regardless their youth .",
    "the very short ( the semi - major axis is 30 times smaller than that of gj569bab ) and eccentric ( @xmath25=0.42 ) orbit of ppl15 may also contribute to its pseudo - synchronism .",
    "we have also compared our spectroscopic data of gj569ba and bb to computations carried out considering line broadening due to collisions with h ( collisions with h@xmath17 were excluded ) . this comparison yields higher values of the minimization function , the same @xmath19 , similar rotational velocities within 5kms@xmath16 , and higher log@xmath20 values ( log@xmath20=5.0 ) , for both the dusty and ucm models .",
    "hence , we will adopt log@xmath20=4.55.0 as the best surface gravity estimates for gj569ba and bb .",
    "this result is in rough agreement with the recent calculations done by gorlova et al@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "concerning @xmath19 , the range 24002500k is indeed very close to the estimates of paper  i , where we found 2440@xmath13100k for gj569ba and 2305@xmath13100k for gj569bb .",
    "we will use these values throughout the present paper .",
    "radial velocities combined with the knowledge of the orbital parameters from astrometry robustly constrain the individual masses of visual binary members . however , in the case of the pair gj569bab there is an additional parameter that has to be considered : its orbital motion around the center of mass of the triple system gj569abab .    the relative velocity of gj569bb with respect to ba ( or vice versa )",
    "is independent of any other velocity .",
    "it is only a function of the orbital parameters and the total mass of the pair .",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ veloc1 ] our velocities ( solid circles ) against the epoch of the observations .",
    "overplotted is the velocity curve computed for the updated orbit of table  [ orbit ] .",
    "the agreement between the spectroscopic and astrometric data is excellent ( within 1@xmath9 the observational error bars ) , confirming the good quality of the keplerian solution .",
    "the mass of each member of the binary is related to the radial velocity by the following equations : @xmath26 }   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] @xmath27   \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] @xmath28   \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath23 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath25 are the orbital parameters as given in table  [ orbit ] , @xmath32 is the true anomaly , and the velocity and mass of gj569ba are indicated by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "equations [ eq1 ] to [ eq3 ] are formulated using the mass ratio , @xmath5=@xmath35/@xmath34 , of the binary .",
    "the quantity @xmath36 accounts for the long - term value of the radial velocity of the centre of mass of the binary , which includes the radial velocity of the triple system , the orbital motion of the centre of mass of the pair around gj569a , and the average velocity of the binary about its barycentre .",
    "the total mass of gj569bab and the shape of the velocity curves of each component are fixed by the astrometric orbit ; hence , there are only two variables in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) : @xmath34 and @xmath36 .",
    "we have produced a grid of pairs of computed velocity curves for @xmath34 and @xmath36 values in the range 0.0550.100@xmath4  and from @xmath189 to @xmath1815kms@xmath16 , respectively , and have compared these velocities to our observed heliocentric data of table  [ vrad ] .",
    "we note that 0.055@xmath4  is the minimum possible mass of gj569ba ( at 3@xmath9 ) according to purely astrometric and photometric considerations ( section  [ improvedorbit ] ) .",
    "the upper limit to the mass has been arbitrarily imposed .",
    "the trial long - term velocity interval covers the range between the largest and smallest heliocentric velocity of the components . to find the optimal mass and long - term velocity we have minimized the chi - squared ( @xmath3 ) function given by the following equation : @xmath37 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 stands for the errors in the velocity measurements",
    "this is , observed velocities ( @xmath39 ) were weighted by their corresponding uncertainties so that the best quality measurements are more important in finding the best fit .",
    "unweighted heliocentric velocities were also compared to the computations by imposing @xmath38=1kms@xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ chi2 ] shows the resulting @xmath3 against mass , and table  [ bestfit ] summarizes the best fits .",
    "the best - fit radial velocity curves correspond to the most likely masses of 0.071@xmath4  ( gj569ba ) , 0.054@xmath4  ( gj569bb ) for the weighted data , and 0.068@xmath4  ( gj569ba ) , 0.057@xmath4  ( gj569bb ) for the unweighted data .",
    "we note , however , that six radial velocity measurements ( three per object ) are probably too few to accurately constrain the systemic velocity of the binary .",
    "consequently , the uncertainty of the parameters including the covariance of @xmath36 and @xmath34 is rather large , being @xmath131.8kms@xmath16 and @xmath130.052@xmath4 , respectively , obtained by increasing the @xmath3 by 2.3 .",
    "dispersions of @xmath130.45kms@xmath16 and @xmath130.011@xmath4  ( given in table  [ bestfit ] ) are derived from the various @xmath3 solutions found when changing the astrometric orbital parameters by their corresponding uncertainties ( given in table  [ orbit ] ) .",
    "this mass uncertainty is also consistent with the discussion below .",
    "there is another way to constrain the mass ratio of the binary .",
    "it makes use of the luminosity and @xmath19 of each component .",

    "the uncertainty in the radii has been derived from the errors of @xmath130.07dex and @xmath13100k in luminosity and @xmath19 , respectively . in sect@xmath6  [ synthetic ]",
    "we have proved that the surface gravities of gj569ba and bb are quite alike , implying that the mass ratio of the pair , @xmath5 , is directly related to the square ratio of the radii .",
    "thus , it follows that @xmath5=0.74@xmath130.25 .",
    "this result is indeed very similar to that obtained from the radial velocity fitting ( table  [ bestfit ] ) , suggesting that the long - term velocity of gj569bab and the masses of the components are reliable to some extent .",
    "as discussed in sect@xmath6  [ improvedorbit ] , the 3@xmath9 upper limit of the mass of gj569bb is 0.070@xmath4 . at the 99%  confidence level , the dynamical mass of gj569bb is in the interval 0.0340.070@xmath4 , and the dynamical mass of gj569ba is in the range 0.0550.087@xmath4 .",
    "these intervals nicely overlap with the mass estimates listed in table  5 of paper  i , which were based solely on the comparison of the photometry with evolutionary models .",
    "more radial velocity measurements are needed to decrease the mass uncertainty and detect the presence of much tiny objects orbiting any of the brown dwarfs .",
    "this sets the mass ratio of the binary , @xmath5 , to be @xmath440.4 , being the most likely value @xmath5=0.750.85 .",
    "the most conservative location of the hydrogen burning mass limit , i.e. , the borderline between stars and brown dwarfs , is 0.072@xmath4  for solar metallicity ( chabrier & baraffe  @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamical mass of gj569bb is definetively below the substellar frontier , confirming it as the _ first genuine brown dwarf known independently of models_. gj569ba is very likely a brown dwarf too , although it may lie at the star  brown dwarf borderline .",
    "for the first time , it is possible to evaluate the predictions of theoretical evolutionary models in the substellar regime , by comparing isochrones to the dynamical mass , @xmath19 , gravity and luminosity of gj569ba and bb . for this independent test",
    ", we need to constrain the age of the triple system . on the other hand",
    ", gj569abab may provide a calibration of the brown dwarf  mass  age  luminosity relation .",
    "the membership of gj569abab to a stellar kinematic group would help us set limits upon the age of the system .",
    "the space velocity components , @xmath45 , of gj569a put it firmly in the young disk region of the space motion groups as defined by eggen @xcite . furthermore , these components can be compared to the space motion of the ursa major ( uma ) moving group ( core and extended halo , sometimes called the sirius supercluster ) and the new supercluster found by chereul , crez , & bienaym @xcite , which has a mean velocity between the sun and the sirius supercluster .    in a recent paper ,",
    "king et al@xmath6 @xcite used the radial velocity of gj569a ( @xmath46@xmath130.28kms@xmath16 ) measured by marcy et al@xmath6 @xcite and the hipparcos parallax and proper motion of gj569a to study its galactic velocity components .",
    "these authors concluded that the membership of gj569a in the young uma moving group is uncertain . using the same data , kenworthy et",
    "al@xmath6 @xcite argued that the kinetics of gj569a is within 7.2kms@xmath16 of the space motion of uma .",
    "nevertheless , none of these authors took into account the orbital motion of gj569a about the barycenter of the triple system .",
    "the mass of this m2.5v - class star is estimated at 0.30.4@xmath4  ( gorlova et al@xmath6 @xcite ) . by applying simple keplerian equations , we inferred that the observed radial velocity of gj569a may be affected by an uncertainty of up to @xmath131.3kms@xmath16 .",
    "hence , the velocity vector of gj569a and its 1@xmath9 error bar turn out to be @xmath47=7.8@xmath130.7 , @xmath48=3.3@xmath130.3 , @xmath49=@xmath1813.3@xmath131.1kms@xmath16 .",
    "we have used the mathematical formulas of johnson & soderblom @xcite to calculate the space - velocity components and their uncertainties from the errors in the observational quantities ( parallax , proper motion and radial velocity ) .",
    "our result is in very much agreement with that of kenworthy et al@xmath6 @xcite and king et al@xmath6 @xcite , except for our larger error bars that mainly come from the uncertainty in the orbital velocity of gj569a .    from the literature",
    ", we have obtained that the mean galactic space - velocity components of the uma moving group are the following : @xmath47=12.8 , @xmath48=2.2 , @xmath49=@xmath188.6kms@xmath16 ( eggen @xcite ; soderblom & mayor @xcite ; orlov et al@xmath6 @xcite ; chen et al@xmath6 @xcite ; asiain et al@xmath6 @xcite ; chereul et al@xmath6 @xcite ; montes et al@xmath6 @xcite ; king et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",

    "this large scatter is not surprising since the group is unbound and spatially extended in the galactic disk .",
    "the space motion vector of gj569a overlaps with that of the uma group if the uncertainties are multiplied by a factor of 2 , which indicates that its membership in the uma cluster is possible , but not very probable . in the kinematic planes shown in fig@xmath6 17 of chereul et al@xmath6 @xcite",

    ", gj569 may kinematically belong to any of these two moving groups .",
    "the age of the uma cluster has been widely discussed in the literature .",
    "the canonical quoted age of the nucleus is around 300myr ( soderblom et al@xmath6 @xcite , and references therein ) , although some older values ( up to 600myr ) are claimed more recently ( king et al@xmath6 @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the massive stars of the new supercluster of chereul et al@xmath6 @xcite have ages very similar to the sirius supercluster ( 1001000myr ) .",
    "nevertheless , based on strmgren photometry , the stream 2 - 43 contains rather young stars , with ages in the interval 300800myr .",
    "hence , we conclude that if gj569 is a member of any of these kinematic groups , its age must be constrained in the range 300800myr .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric properties of the star gj569a also support the youth of the system .",
    "the age of gj569a has been deeply studied in the literature ( e.g. , forrest et al@xmath6 @xcite ; henry & kirkpatrick @xcite ; martn et al@xmath6 @xcite ; kenworthy et al@xmath6 @xcite ; gizis , reid , & hawley @xcite ) .",
    "the various groups conclude that gj569a exhibits many of the attributes of young stars ( chromospheric activity , flaring ) , and claim that the likely age of gj569a is in the interval 1201000myr .",
    "in addition , the color - magnitude diagrams shown in paper  i , which included the decomposition of the near - infrared photometry of the binary , also suggest that gj569 is a young system .",
    "we note that our @xmath19 values from paper  i are within 50k of those recently found by gorlova et al@xmath6 @xcite , and within 75k of the new @xmath19spectral type calibration by dahn et al@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the updated luminosities of sect@xmath6  [ mass_determination ] are also within the error bars of previous estimates .",
    "figures  [ mass_lum ] and  [ mass_teff ] show gj569ba and bb plotted on the mass  luminosity and mass@xmath19 diagrams , respectively .",
    "both the weighted and unweighted dynamical masses are displayed . for the figures , we have considered four different sets of pre - main sequence evolutionary models : the nextgen models of baraffe et al@xmath6 @xcite , the corrected isochrones of dantona & mazzitelli @xcite , hereafter dm97 , the `` arizona '' tracks of burrows et al@xmath6 @xcite , and the most recent release of the cond models by baraffe et al@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these include essentially all of the models widely used by many authors for substellar studies .",
    "the two evolutionary tracks of baraffe et al@xmath6 ( 1998 , 2003 ) are usually referred to as the `` lyon '' models . for a detailed description of the evolutionary models , see the corresponding authors .",
    "nevertheless , we note that all of them are state - of - the - art calculations that employ sophisticated physiscs and boundary conditions .",
    "since the two brown dwarfs of gj569bab are supposed to be coeval , a single isochrone is expected to fit both components simultaneously .",
    "models must also reproduce the absolute and relative location of the brown dwarfs in the diagrams .    from figs@xmath6  [ mass_lum ] and  [ mass_teff ] ,",
    "the four sets of isochrones indicate that gj569bab is relatively young , @xmath12001000myr , with a likely age at around 300myr .",
    "we note that this result agrees with the discussion on the system age of the previous section .",
    "it is important to remark that all models yield reasonable fits to the observed parameters of the brown dwarf binary only if the system turns out to be about a few hundred million years old . in the following",
    ", we will briefly discuss on the fine details of the comparisons .",
    "we recall that the masses of gj569ba and bb have been derived independently of models , whereas temperatures and luminosities hinge to some extent on external calibrations . for the lyon and arizona models ,",
    "both the primary and secondary components of the binary lie within 1@xmath9 of the 300-myr isochrones depicted in fig@xmath6  [ mass_lum ] .",
    "we are now considering the unweighted dynamical masses .",
    "however , the luminosity prediction of the 300-myr dm97 track for the dynamical mass of gj569bb deviates by 2@xmath9 .",
    "in general , the lyon and arizona theoretical mass  luminosity relations for ages around a few hundred million years agree acceptably well with our observations of the binary gj569bab at the level of 1@xmath9 the observational uncertainties .",
    "larger differences are found when comparing gj569ba and bb to the mass@xmath19 relations shown in fig@xmath6  [ mass_teff ] .",
    "while the lyon models at the age of 300myr appear to reproduce within 1@xmath9 the slope formed by the members of the pair , gj569ba and bb lie at different isochrones of the arizona models .",
    "the secondary and primary appear between 1 and 2@xmath9 up and down , respectively , of the predictions of the 300myr dm97 isochrone .      for a test of consistency between evolutionary models , model atmospheres and @xmath19 calibrations ,",
    "we have obtained the surface gravity of gj569ba and bb by means of synthetic spectral fitting ( see sect@xmath6  [ synthetic ] ) .",
    "radii can be derived from log@xmath20 and the newton s law for gravitation . adopting @xmath50=27380.215cms@xmath21 and the unweighted dynamical masses",
    ", the radius of gj569ba and bb is @xmath51=0.18@xmath52 and 0.17@xmath53 , respectively .",
    "these values are plotted against mass in fig@xmath6  [ radii ] , together with the lyon and arizona isochrones .",
    "there is a large discrepancy ( about a factor of 1.6 ) between the predictions of the evolutionary models and the radii obtained from the spectral fitting .",
    "such a discrepancy translates into a difference in log@xmath20 of the order of 0.5dex .",
    "very recently , mohanty et al@xmath6 @xcite have reported finding very low gravities in young late - type stars of the upper scorpius association as compared to theoretical evolutionary model predictions . according to these authors ,",
    "the differences are the largest for the coolest types ( @xmath54m7 ) .",
    "we note , however , that the radii derived in sect@xmath6  [ mass_determination ] are in much better agreement with the evolutionary models if the age of the pair is about a few hundred million years .",
    "the discrepancy between the radii predictions for gj569ba and bb and those inferred from the spectroscopically derived surface gravities could be due to a combination of the uncertainties in the @xmath19spectral type calibrations , the spectral synthesis , the model atmospheres , the log@xmath20 step employeed in the synthetic calculations , and the evolution isochrones ( see mohanty et al@xmath6 @xcite for a rather extensive discussion ) . on the other hand , the formation processes and evolution of binaries are not well understood , and tracks describing the evolution of `` single '' objects might not be valid .",
    "nevertheless , warmer values of the @xmath19 assignement of gj569ba and bb would bring to a better harmony the radii predictions of evolutionary models and spectral fitting techniques . from our spectral fitting analysis",
    ", we observed that larger best - fit values of log@xmath20 are found for hotter temperatures ( see the contours of fig@xmath6 [ minima ] ) , e.g. , 2600k and log@xmath20=5.0 ( collisions with h and h@xmath17 ) and 5.5 ( collisions with h ) , although they do not minimize the function defined by pavlenko et al@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a temperature of 2600k is marginally consistent with the most recent calibrations for m8.5m9 dwarf objects . on the other hand , an increase of 150k in the @xmath19 of gj569ba and bb",
    "does not change significantly the discussion of sect@xmath6  [ comparisons ] .",
    "actually , the arizona models would fit better the observed parameters of the binary at 300myr , and the lyon models would predict a slightly younger age for the system .    in any case , the spectral fitting of the ki doublet at 1.25@xmath2 and the radii derivation of sect@xmath6  [ mass_determination ] suggest that the radii of gj569ba and bb are larger than the evolutionary model predictions for the oldest ages ( @xmath11gyr ) .",
    "this might be due to the young age of the objects ( the brown dwarfs would be contracting ) ; on the other hand , part of this discrepancy might be real .",
    "similar discrepancies have been observed in low - mass eclipsing binaries and in the interferometric radii measurements of m - dwarfs as reported by various groups .",
    "for example , models fail to predict the radius of the transiting planet hd209458b ( predictions are too small , baraffe et al@xmath6 @xcite ) , and underestimate the size of cool stars up to 10%  ( e.g. , lane , boden , & kulkarni @xcite ; ribas @xcite ; sgransan et al@xmath6 @xcite ) . for a definitive and critical constraint of substellar model predictions , the size of each brown dwarf of the binary gj569bab",
    "should be determined by means that do not include any theoretical calculations or external calibrations , e.g. , near infrared interferometry , or photometric monitoring to determine rotation periods and infer radii by assuming that the rotation angles are perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary .",
    "the mass ratio of gj569bab is @xmath5@xmath440.4 , very likely @xmath5=0.750.85 ( table  [ bestfit ] ) .",
    "many other binary brown dwarfs have similar mass ratio estimates ( based on the comparison to evolutionary models ) , like , e.g. , ppl15 ( @xmath5=0.87 , basri & martn @xcite ) , 2massj0231016040618 ( @xmath5=0.7 , close et al@xmath6 @xcite ) , 2massj1426316 + 155701 ( @xmath5=0.9 , close et al@xmath6 @xcite ) , and hd130948bc ( @xmath5=0.9 , potter et al@xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "close et al@xmath6 @xcite presents the compilation of nearly all very low mass , field resolved binary systems known to date , concluding that they tend to have nearly equal mass components ( @xmath5@xmath10.9 ) .",
    "furthermore , martn et al@xmath6 @xcite have investigated the binary fraction among young brown dwarfs of the pleiades cluster ( 120myr ) , finding that the frequency of these binaries is about 15%  ( for separations between 7 and 12au ) , with a clear trend to high mass ratios ( @xmath5@xmath440.7 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the discovery of substellar pairs like @xmath55indib ( @xmath5=0.6 , mccaughrean et al@xmath6 @xcite ) suggests that binaries with moderate mass ratios are also possible , albeit they appear to be less frequent .",
    "any model describing the formation mechanisms of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs should be capable of explaining these observations .",
    "using the keckii adaptive optics facility and the nirspec instrument , we have obtained new near - infrared images that have allowed us to improve the astrometric solution of the substellar binary gj569bab , which is a proper motion companion to the m2.5v - type star gj569a .",
    "the improved orbital parameters lie within 1-@xmath9 the previously published values of lane et al@xmath6 @xcite , suggesting that the orbit is now determined to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "the total mass of the pair turns out to be 0.125@xmath130.015@xmath4  at the 3-@xmath9 confidence level .",
    "we have also obtained high - resolution spectra of each component , gj569ba and bb , using the echelle mode of nirspec on four different occasions during one orbital period .",
    "the spectra , with a resolution of 0.55  ( @xmath0@xmath122500 ) , cover the wavelength range between 1.2400 and 1.2575@xmath15 m , which includes the ki doublet at 1.2436 and 1.2526@xmath15 m .",
    "we have used these spectroscopic data to measure radial velocities of each member of the binary system with an accuracy between 1.1 and 2kms@xmath16 .",
    "the combination of the astrometric orbit and the spectroscopic velocities has allowed us to derive the dynamical masses of gj569ba and bb and the systemic velocity of the pair by means of a @xmath3 fitting technique .",
    "we note that our results show a marked correlation , which yields relatively large uncertainties in the parameters .",
    "more radial velocities measurements are needed to break the covariance problem .",
    "holding the long - term velocity of gj569bab fixed at its best - fit values , the masses obtained are @xmath56=0.068 and @xmath57=0.057@xmath4  for the unweighted velocities , and @xmath56=0.071 and @xmath57=0.054@xmath4  for the weighted data .",
    "this implies that the mass ratio of the binary is greater than 0.4 , being the most likely value @xmath5=0.750.85 .",
    "the dynamical masses are affected by an uncertainty of 1620%  ( the error increases if the covariance problem is taken into account ) .",
    "because of this uncertainty , the more massive component , gj569ba may lie at the star  brown dwarf borderline .",
    "however , the mass of the secondary , gj569bb , is very likely below the substellar limit . for the first time",
    ", the substellar mass of one brown dwarf is dynamically confirmed , i.e. , without any theoretical assumption .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the primary star gj569a , as well as its @xmath45 space velocities , suggest that the age of the triple system is in the interval 300800myr .",
    "the dynamical masses of gj569ba and bb , along with their effective temperatures and luminosities , have been compared to the mass - luminosity and mass-@xmath19 relations given by four different sets of state - of - the - art evolutionary models .",
    "we have found that these models reasonably reproduce the absolute and relative locations of gj569ba and bb in the luminosity vs@xmath6 mass and @xmath19 vs@xmath6 mass diagrams if the age of the binary is about a few hundred million years .",
    "hence , as for luminosities and @xmath19 s , evolutionary models appear to exhibit good performance in the regime of high substellar masses .",
    "the observed high - resolution spectra of gj569ba ( m8.5v ) and bb ( m9v ) have been compared to various spectral synthesis using three different sets of model atmospheres .",
    "our spectral fitting procedure yields @xmath19 s that are very similar ( within 100k ) to the calibrations for m8m9-class objects available in the literature , and surface gravities that are quite small as compared to the predictions of evolutionary models .",
    "a similar discrepancy has been recently reported by mohanty et al@xmath6 @xcite .",

    "<S> we have obtained new images and high - resolution ( @xmath0@xmath122400 ) near - infrared ( 1.24001.2575@xmath2 ) spectra of each component of the brown dwarf binary gj569bab using the adaptive optics facility of the keckii telescope and the nirspec spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> these data have allowed us to improve the determination of the astrometric orbit and to measure radial velocities of the components . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the astrometric and spectroscopic measurements to derive the dynamical mass of each brown dwarf and the systemic velocity of the pair by means of a @xmath3 fitting technique . from various considerations , </S>",
    "<S> the mass of each component is likely in the range 0.0340.070@xmath4  ( gj569bb ) and 0.0550.087@xmath4  ( gj569ba ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the mass ratio , @xmath5 , of the binary is greater than 0.4 , being the most likely value @xmath5=0.750.85 . adopting 0.072@xmath4  as the most conservative location of the substellar limit for solar metallicity </S>",
    "<S> , our analysis confirms gj569bb as the _ first genuine brown dwarf known without any theoretical assumption_. we have compared the dynamical masses of gj569ba and bb , and their effective temperatures and luminosities , to the predictions of state - of - the - art theoretical evolutionary isochrones , finding that models exhibit good performance in the regime of high substellar masses if the binary is about a few hundred million years old . </S>",
    "<S> however , the surface gravities of gj569ba ( m8.5v ) and bb ( m9v ) derived from our spectral analysis ( the observed data have been compared to the latest synthetic spectra ) appear to be smaller than the values provided by the evolutionary models . </S>"
