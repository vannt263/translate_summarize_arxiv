    "over the recent past there has been considerable experimental activity in the direct detection of dark matter@xcite and further progress is expected in the ongoing experiments@xcite and new experiments that may come online in the future@xcite . at the same time",
    "there have been several theoretical developments which have shed light on the ambiguities and possible corrections that might be associated with the predictions on supersymmetric dark matter .",
    "these consist of the effects on the dark matter analyses of wimp velocity@xcite and of the rotation of the galaxy@xcite , the effects of the uncertainties of quark densities@xcite and the uncertainties of the susy parameters@xcite , effects of large cp violating phases@xcite , effects of scalar nonuniversalities@xcite , effects of nonuniversalities of gaugino masses@xcite and effects of coannihilation@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will discuss some of these briefly but mainly focus on the effects of nonuniversalities of the gaugino masses on dark matter . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "there are 32 supersymmetric particles and with r parity conservation the lowest mass supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is absolutely stable . in many unified models , such as in the sugra models@xcite",
    ", one finds that the lightest neutralino is the lsp over most of the parameter space of the model .",
    "thus the lightest neutralino is a candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "the quantity that constrains supersymmetric models is @xmath0 where @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the density of relic neutralinos at the current temperatures , and @xmath3 is the critical matter density , and h is the hubble parameter @xmath4 in units of 100 km / smpc .",
    "the most recent measurements of h from the hubble space telescope give@xcite @xmath5 similarly the most recent analyses of @xmath6 give@xcite @xmath7 if we assume that the component of @xmath8 in @xmath6 is @xmath9 which appears reasonable , then this leads to the result @xmath10 .",
    "perhaps a more cautious choice of the range would be a @xmath11 range which gives @xmath12 the quantity of interest theoretically is @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the freeze - out temperature , @xmath15 where k is the boltzman constant , @xmath16 is the number of degrees of freedom at the time of the freeze - out , @xmath17 is the reheating factor , and @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the thermal average with @xmath21 the neutralino annihilation cross - section and v the neutralino relative velocity .",
    "both direct and indirect methods are desirable and complementary for the detection of milky way wimps .",
    "we shall focus here on the direct detection . in this case",
    "the fundamental detector is the quark and the relevant interactions are the supergravity neutralino - quark - squark interactions .",
    "the scattering of neutralinos from quarks contains squark poles in the s channel and the z boson and the higgs boson ( @xmath22 ) poles in the t channel .",
    "since the wimp scattering from quarks is occuring at rather low energies one may , to a good approximation , integrate on the intermediate squark , z and higgs poles to obtain a low energy effective lagrangian which gives a four - fermi interaction of the following form @xmath23 the contribution of d is generally small and thus the scattering is effectively governed by the terms a , b and c. analysis of dark matter is affected by several factors .",
    "we discuss these briefly below .",
    "two of the quantities that control the detection of dark matter are the wimp mass density and the wimp velocity .",
    "estimates of milky way wimp density lie in the range@xcite @xmath24 and the event rates in the direct detection depend directly on this density .",
    "a second important factor regarding wimps that enters in the dark matter analyses is the wimp velocity .",
    "one typically assumes a maxwellian velocity distribution for the wimps and the current estimates for the rms wimp velocity give @xmath25 with , however , a significant uncertainty .",
    "estimates for the uncertainty lie in the range of @xmath26 km / s to @xmath27 km / s @xcite .",
    "a reasonable estimate then is that the rms wimp velocity lies in the range@xcite @xmath28 analyses including the wimp velocity variations show that the detection rates can have a significant variation , i.e. , a factor of 2 - 3 on either side of the central values@xcite .      the scattering of neutralinos from quarks are dominated by the scalar interaction which is controlled by the term c in eq.(6 ) .",
    "the dominant part of the scattering thus arises from the scalar part of the @xmath29 cross - section which is given by @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the reduced mass in the @xmath29 system and @xmath32 ( i = u , d , s quarks ) are quark densities inside the proton defined by @xmath33 there are significant uncertainties in the determination of @xmath32 . to see the range of these uncertainties it is useful to parametrize the quark densities",
    "so that@xcite @xmath34 where we have defined @xmath35 the current range of determinations of @xmath36 give@xcite @xmath37 with the above range of errors one finds that @xmath32 lie in the range @xmath38 of these the errors in @xmath39 generates the largest variations .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that the scalar cross - section can vary by a factor of 5 in either direction due to errors in the quark densities@xcite .",
    "the soft susy breaking parameters that arise in supersymmetric theories after spontaneous breaking are in general complex with phases o(1 ) and can lead to large electric dipole moment of the electron and of the neutron in conflict with current experiment .",
    "recently a cancellation mechanism was proposed as a possible solution to this problem@xcite . with the cancellation mechanism the total edm of the electron and of the neutron can be in conformity with data even with phases o(1 ) and sparticle masses which are relatively light .",
    "the presence of large cp phases can affect dark matter and other low energy phenomena .",
    "effects of cp violating phases on dark matter have been investigated for some time@xcite and more recently such analyses have been extended to determine the effects of large cp phases under the cancellation mechanism@xcite .",
    "one finds that the edm constraints play a crucial role in these analyses .",
    "thus in the absence of cp violating phases one finds that the @xmath29 cross - section can change by orders of magnitude when plotted as a function of @xmath40 ( the phase of @xmath41 ) .",
    "these effects are , however , significantly reduced when the constraints arising from the current experimental limits on the electron and on the neutron edms are imposed . after the imposition of the constraints the effects of cp violating phases are still quite significant in that the @xmath29 cross - section can vary by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "thus precision predictions of the @xmath29 cross - section should take account of the cp phases if indeed such phases do exist in a given model .",
    "indeed many string and d brane models do indeed possess such phases and thus inclusion of such phases is imperative in making predictions for direct detection in such models .",
    "the effects of coannihilation may become important when the next to the lowest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) has a mass which lies close to the lsp mass@xcite .",
    "the size of the effects is exponentially damped by the factor @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and where @xmath46 is the lsp mass .",
    "because of this damping the coannihilation effects are typically important only for regions of the parameter space where the constraint @xmath47 is satisfied .",
    "some of the possible candidates for nlsp are the light stau @xmath48 , @xmath49 , the next to the lightest neutralino @xmath50 , and the light chargino @xmath51 .",
    "an interesting result one finds is that in msugra the upper limit on the neutralino mass consistent with the current experimental constraints on the relic density is extended from 200 gev to 600 gev@xcite when the effects of @xmath52 coannihilation are included . in secs.(2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) we will show that the allowed range of the neutralino mass can also be extended by inclusion of nonuniversalities in the gaugino masses .      the minimal sugra model is based on the universality at the gut scale .",
    "this includes the universality of the scalar masses , of the gaugino masses and of the trilinear couplings at the gut scale . in supergravity",
    "unified models the universality of the soft susy breaking parameters arises from the assumption of a flat kahler potential .",
    "however , the nature of physics at the gut / planck scale is not fully understood and a more general analysis of the soft susy breaking sector requires that one work with a curved kahler potential@xcite .",
    "such an analysis in general leads to nonuniversalities in the scalar sector of the theory .",
    "however , the nonuniversalities in the scalar sector can not be completely arbitrary as there are very stringent constraints on the system from the limits on the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "a satisfaction of the constraints requires essentially a degeneracy in the scalar masses in the first two generations at the gut scale .",
    "however , the constraints on the scalar masses in the higgs sector and on masses in the third generation are far less severe and one could introduce significant amounts of nonuniversalities in these sectors without violating the fcnc constraints . it is found convenient to parametrize the nonuniversalities in the higgs sector by @xmath53 so that at the gut scale ( @xmath54 ) one has @xmath55 ,   @xmath56 .",
    "similarly one may parametrize the nonuniversalities in the third generation squark sector by @xmath57 so that at the scale @xmath54 one has @xmath58 ,   @xmath59 .",
    "these nonuniversalities have a significant effect on the low energy physics .",
    "one of the main effects that occurs is through the effect on @xmath41 which is determined via the constraint of the radiative breaking of the electro - weak symmetry and is modified in the presence of the nonuniversalities in the higgs sector and in the third generation sector . to one loop order it is given by@xcite @xmath60 here",
    "@xmath61 is the value of @xmath41 in the absence of nonuniversalities , @xmath62 depends on the top yukawa coupling and defines the position of the landau pole , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the loop correction .",
    "we note that the entire effect of nonuniversalities is now explicity exhibited .",
    "one finds that the universalities can significantly affect the event rates .",
    "the effect on the event rates occurs specifically because of the effect on @xmath41 .",
    "thus one finds that for certain regions of the parameter space the nonuniversalities in the higgs and in the third generation sector make a negative contribution to @xmath65 which leads to larger higgsino components for the neutralino . since in the direct detection",
    "the scattering is dominated by the scalar @xmath29 cross - section which in turn depends on the product of the gaugino and the higgsino components one finds that a smaller @xmath41 leads to larger event rates in the direct detection .",
    "a detailed analysis of the effects of nonuniversalities of the scalar masses has been given in refs.@xcite .",
    "we will discuss further this phenomena in the context of the nonuniversalities in the gaugino sector in the next section .",
    "nonuniversality of gaugino masses arises in grand unified models via corrections to the gauge kinetic energy functions@xcite .",
    "thus in grand unified models a non - trivial gauge kinetic energy function leads to a gaugino mass matrix which has the form@xcite @xmath66 as an example if we consider the gut group to be su(5 ) then the gauge kinetic energy function @xmath67 transforms as follows @xmath68 where @xmath69 stands for the symmetric product .",
    "the term that transforms like the singlet of su(5 ) in the gauge kinetic energy function leads to universality of the gaugino masses , while the @xmath70 plet , the @xmath71 plet and the @xmath72 plet will generate corrections to universality . in general one could have an admixture of the various representations and this will lead to gaugino masses of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 depend on r and for the representations @xmath75 they are given in table 1@xcite .",
    "the nonuniversality of the gaugino masses also leads to corrections of the gauge coupling constants at the gut scale and in general one has @xmath76 .",
    "we note , however , that the coefficients @xmath77 that enter in @xmath78 are different than those that enter in @xmath79 .",
    "this is so because the corrections to @xmath78 involve only the gauge kinetic energy function while the corrections to @xmath79 involve the gauge kinetic energy function as well as the nature of gut physics .",
    "su(5 ) rep & @xmath80 & @xmath81 & @xmath82 + & 1 & 1&1 + & -1 & @xmath83&@xmath84 + & -5&3 & @xmath85 + & 10 & 2 & 1 +     +    the gaugino sector nonuniversalities affect @xmath41 . to exhibit this effect",
    "we can expand @xmath41 determined via the constraint of the radiative breaking of the electro - weak symmetry in terms of the parameter @xmath86 .",
    "one finds the following expansion @xmath87 and for @xmath88 one has@xcite @xmath89 thus in these cases the nonuniversalities lead to a smaller value of @xmath90 .",
    "now as already mentioned in the previous section the higgsino components become more dominant as @xmath41 becomes smaller .",
    "we can exhibit this analytically for the case when @xmath41 is small but we are still in the scaling region@xcite where @xmath91 . in this case",
    "it is possible to analytically investigate the size of the gaugino - higgsino components @xmath92 of the lsp defined by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the bino , @xmath95 is the wino , and @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are the two higgsinos . in this case one",
    "finds that the gaugino components of the lsp are given by @xmath98 , and @xmath99 while the higgsino components are given by@xcite @xmath100 , @xmath101 . from",
    "the above one finds that the higgsino components have a dependence on the inverse power of @xmath41 and thus a smaller @xmath41 will lead to a larger scalar @xmath102 cross - section .",
    "the literature on the analyses of dark matter relic density@xcite and direct detection in mssm@xcite and in sugra models@xcite is quite extensive@xcite .",
    "we discuss here the quantitative effects of the gaugino mass nonuniversality on dark matter .",
    "some features of the effects of gaugino mass nonuniversalities have already been discussed in the literature@xcite and we review here the more recent developments@xcite .",
    "the techniques used in the analysis are as discussed in ref.@xcite and in the analysis we impose the @xmath103 constraint@xcite . in fig.[exfig1 ]",
    "we plot the scalar @xmath29 cross - section as a function of the neutralino mass for the case of gut scale nonuniversalities with values of @xmath104 in the range -0.1 to 0.08 .",
    "one finds that the scalar cross - section is enhanced for negative values of @xmath104 just as one would expect from the general discussion above because it is for the case of @xmath104 negative that @xmath41 becomes small .",
    "one finds that in general the scalar cross - section increases systematically as @xmath105 increases for negative values of @xmath104 and an enhancement of the scalar cross - section by as much as a factor of 10 can be gotten relative to the universal case of @xmath106 .",
    "one also finds an enhancement of the allowed range of the neutralino mass consistent with the constraints . in fig.[exfig2 ] we plot the maximum and the minimum of the scalar cross - section as a function of the neutralino mass for the case of gut scale nonuniversalities where the nonuniversalities arise from the 200 plet representation with @xmath107 when the other parameters are varied over their assumed naturalness range .",
    "the current experimental limits from dama@xcite and from cdms@xcite are also plotted .",
    "further , the currents limits would certainly be significantly improved in other dark matter detectors in the future@xcite and in fig.[exfig2 ] we also plot the expected limits from future cdms , and from genius@xcite .",
    "one finds that the current experiment does constrain the theory in a small region of the parameter space .",
    "further , the expected sensitivity in future experiment , i.e. , in cdms and in genius will explore a major part of the parameter space of this model .",
    "we also note that the inclusion of nonuniversality significantly increases the allowed range of the neutralino parameter space .",
    "nonuniversality of gaugino masses is rather generic in string theory .",
    "however , the specific nature of the nonuniversality will depend on the details of the compactification .",
    "we discuss here the effects of gaugino mass nonuniversality on dark matter in the context of d brane models .",
    "the possibility of nonuniversal gaugino phases in brane models arises from the choice of embedding of the different gauge groups of the standard model on different branes .",
    "one may consider , from example , models that arise from type iib string compactified on a six - torus @xmath108 which contains 9 branes , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( i=1,2,3 ) branes and 3 branes .",
    "not all the branes can be present simultaneuosly due to the constraint of n=1 supersymmetry which requires that one has either 9 branes and @xmath110 ( i=1,2,3 ) branes or @xmath109 ( i=1,2,3 ) branes and 3 branes . in the following",
    "we will make the choice of embedding on @xmath111 branes and 5 branes@xcite .",
    "one of the major problems in developing a sensible string phenomenology is that the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking in string theory is still lacking .",
    "however , some progress can be made by use of an efficient parametrization of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "here we use the parametrization where the breaking of supersymmetry arises from the breaking generated by the dilaton and the moduli vev s of the following form@xcite @xmath112@xmath113@xmath114 ,   @xmath115@xmath113@xmath116 .",
    "we consider now a specific 9 - 5 brane model .",
    "here one embeds the @xmath117 gauge group on 9 branes and @xmath118 gauge group on a @xmath119 brane . the alternative possibility of embedding the standard model gauge group on five branes",
    "is discussed in the last two papers of ref.@xcite . for the @xmath120 brane model",
    "the soft susy breaking sector of the theory is given by@xcite @xmath121    here @xmath122 is the goldstino direction in the dilaton s ( moduli @xmath123 ) vev space .",
    "we discuss now dark matter on d branes . in fig.[exfig3 ] we give a plot of the scalar @xmath29 cross section as a function of the neutralino mass for the @xmath120 d brane model .",
    "one of the interesting feature of the d brane model is that the scalar masses are in general not universal .",
    "however for @xmath124 one has @xmath125 and the scalar masses are universal although the gaugino masses are still nonuniversal . since we are mostly interested here in investigating the effects of nonuniversalities of the gaugino masses in this analysis , we impose universality of the scalar masses and set @xmath124 . in fig.[exfig3 ] we give a plot of the minimum and the maximum of the scalar @xmath29 cross section under this constraint .",
    "one finds that under the assumed constraints the allowed domain of the parameter space has the general features which are similar to the gut scale nonuniversalities .",
    "one common feature is that the allowed domain of the parameter space is extended close to 500 gev .",
    "one may note that if in addition to the constraint @xmath124 one also sets @xmath126 one finds also universality of the gaugino masses .",
    "this situation is exhibited by the vertical dark line in the enclosed region on the left hand side in fig.[exfig3 ] .",
    "in this paper we have given a brief review of the recent theoretical developments in the analyses of supersymmeteric dark matter .",
    "our emphasis has been in exploring the effects of uncertainties of the input data and the effects of nonuniversalities of the gaugino masses on dark matter analyses .",
    "it is found that the uncertainties of the wimp velocities can change detection rates by up to factors of 2 - 3 while the uncertainties in quark masses and densities can change the @xmath29 cross - section by up to factors of 5 in either direction .",
    "the effects of gaugino mass nonuniversalities on dark matter analyses is found to be quite dramatic .",
    "it is seen that gaugino mass nonuniversalities can increase the higgsino components of the lsp and significantly increase the @xmath29 cross - section from scalar interactions and also increase the allowed range of the lsp consistent with relic density constraints .",
    "thus an increase in the scalar @xmath29 cross - sections by up to a factor of 10 can occur while the allowed range of the neutralino masses can move up to 500 gev consistent with the relic density constraints .",
    "data from current dark matter experiments is beginning to put constraints on models with nonuniversalities .",
    "these constraints will become more severe as the sensitivity of dark matter experiments increase in the future . + * acknowledgements * + this research was supported in part by nsf grant phy-9901057 .",
