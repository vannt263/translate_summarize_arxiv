    "jet are very important for agn unification .",
    "all radio loud objects have powerful jets . in the orientation unification scheme , blazars , with their extreme flux and polarization variability ,",
    "have the jets beamed towards us .",
    "however viewing angle unification is not the complete story .",
    "do all the jets have similar physical properties on average , so that orientation is able to explain most of the variations of observed properties among blazars ?",
    "optical polarization of blazars provides magnetic field information very close to the jet formation region and is therefore a very important tool for probing jet physics .",
    "we have investigated a sample of 51 blazars with many optical polarization measurements made over the past 20 - 30 years . in paper",
    "i , we have investigated the relationship between the optical polarization position angle and the vlbi radio structure .",
    "the results are consistent with a shock model . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the variability of optical polarization position angles . assuming a simple shock model , we link the angle variability with jet orientation and speed to explore the jet physical parameters among blazars .",
    "since a blazar s optical polarization swings over a wide range of angles , there exists a 180  ambiguity .",
    "linear statistics based on normal distributions is not strictly correct .",
    "therefore we use circular statistics  a technique little used in astronomy but commonly used for example , to analyze directions of returning homing pigeons , or wind directions .",
    "thus , from the polarization position angles @xmath0 , we calculate the circular standard deviation @xmath1 about the mean angle , to represent their scatter ( fisher 1993 ) .",
    "polarization data are axial , i.e. only cover the range @xmath2 to @xmath3",
    ". however , the @xmath4 are truly circular data .",
    "we first calculate @xmath5 , then divide by 2 to get @xmath1 : @xmath6^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the total number of measurements .",
    "if the sample has a large intrinsic scatter , the determination of the real scatter depends on the accurate shape of the wrapped distribution between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "if the sampling of data is not enough to reveal the detailed shape of the distribution , the @xmath1 calculation algorithm gives a maximum @xmath10 .      in the unification scheme of powerful radio sources ,",
    "the core - dominated sources are the doppler - boosted jet , viewed end - on . at larger angles",
    "the core becomes much weaker and collimated jets link the well resolved double lobes .",
    "doppler boosting in core - dominant sources is supported by their very high brightness temperatures and by superluminal motions .",
    "statistical analyses of radio source samples support the unified scheme ( m. chiaberge , this conference ) .",
    "the ratio of core - to - lobe luminosity , or the core dominance , r , is therefore a good indicator of viewing angle .",
    "however , in blazar samples , viewing angle is not the only parameter affecting doppler boosting . from work of other authors ( orr and browne 1982 ) , we know that r depends on three physical parameters and can be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the viewing angle of the jet , @xmath13 is the bulk speed of the emitting electrons in the jet and @xmath14 is the tangential value of r measured for an average edge - on jet in radio galaxies .",
    "we used @xmath15 at 5ghz rest frequency ( e.g. figure  1 of hoekstra , barthel & he s 1997 ) . while r is of course sensitive to @xmath12 , for smaller @xmath12 ( e.g. @xmath16 ) , it is increasingly sensitive to @xmath13 .    for each object we calculated r at 5 ghz rest frequency , using core and lobe flux densities from literature .",
    "in section  4 , we will calculate logr from models using the formula above and compare the models with observed values .",
    "figure  1  ( a ) shows that there is a correlation between @xmath1 and logr .",
    "the correlation is significant at the 99.9% level .",
    "however , we note that the correlation is not linear . for the logr@xmath172 region , which includes most blazars ,",
    "@xmath1 increases with logr , but for logr@xmath182 , there is a lot of scatter .",
    "no object has @xmath1 larger than 66 , as expected from the algorithms for large scatter and small sample size .",
    "the model we use makes the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "optical emission comes from a transverse shock propagating along the jet .",
    "2 .   the shock compresses the magnetic field so much that the magnetic component along the jet direction is negligible .",
    "3 .   in the plane of the shock",
    ", there is a dominant magnetic field direction that changes randomly with time .",
    "this magnetic field direction corresponds to the emission region whose radiation happens to be boosted towards us .",
    "different ejection directions observed for emerging blobs on vlbi scales and complex vlbi structure suggests that these dominant regions change rapidly .",
    "the shock is optically thin .",
    "when the shock is viewed face on , the magnetic field direction projected on the sky will vary randomly with time .",
    "as the viewing angle is increased , the projected magnetic field direction will lie increasingly perpendicular to the projected jet direction .",
    "a simplification is afforded by the lorentz invariance of the ratios of stokes parameters , so our calculations of projected magnetic field direction in the co - moving frame ( viewing angle @xmath19 ) can be referred to the observer s frame using the relation ( bjornsson , c .- i .",
    "1982 ) :    @xmath20 for a given set of @xmath13 and @xmath12 , we generate 100 randomly oriented magnetic field directions to simulate the random changes over time inside the shock plane and project them onto the sky in the co - moving frame . the circular standard deviation of those angles",
    "can then be compared with real observations , using the relation between r and @xmath12 given earlier .",
    "@xmath21 is fixed by observations , so the only free parameter in this model is @xmath13 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  1  ( b ) .",
    "each curve represents a model with fixed @xmath13 , with @xmath12 decreasing from bottom left to top right .",
    "the values of @xmath12 are marked along the curve . from left to right , @xmath22 .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath1 is the result of the computational limit .",
    "the lower limits are caused by the fact that we only have 100 simulated vectors to do statistics and any one vector that happens to be parallel to the jet direction contributes a lot to the scatter . in principle , if we had an increasing number of vectors , the lower limit for @xmath1 would approach 0 . on our model ,",
    "the @xmath1 vs. logr correlation arises because @xmath23 for most blazars , and so the viewing angle dependence dominates for logr@xmath24 . for logr@xmath25 ,",
    "the scatter is the result of a tail to higher jet speeds .",
    "our simple model with only one free parameter , @xmath13 , accounts for the correlation we find between the scatter in optical polarization angles , c(@xmath26 ) , and the core - dominance , log  r. figure  1 shows that the average jet speed differs significantly amongst the powerful blazars , with a range of values comparable with those derived from superluminal motion and from the statistics of core - dominance in radio - source surveys ( urry & padovani 1995 ) . in unified schemes",
    "it is important to take into account that log r is not simply a measure of orientation .",
    "jet speed introduces considerable scatter , especially at log r @xmath18 2 .",
