    "now , if the fermi level @xmath154 is fixed at @xmath155 where we have localized states ( see fig .  [ dos3](b ) ) , then for small rashba coupling strength the gap between the localized level and the bottom of the right sub - band can be made small enough for the electrons to bridge .",
    "therefore , the system behaves as a @xmath63-type semiconductor .",
    "similarly , if @xmath20 is fixed at @xmath156 and the fermi level is set at the top of the left sub - band , then the system can be implemented equivalently as a @xmath64-type semiconductor . in this case holes",
    "are created in the left sub - band .",
    "it is important to mention that when the site energies ( @xmath93 and @xmath20 ) are fixed at the same value , then also the system can be used as a semi - conductor depending on the electron concentration .",
    "the detailed analysis is available in ref .",
    "@xcite .      with proper tuning of the external parameters like , magnetic flux @xmath0 and rashba strength @xmath25",
    ", a diamond network can achieve a high degree of spin polarization as discussed earlier in a theoretical work by aharony _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we discuss this feature from a different point of view .    when there is no external magnetic field or magnetic flux , time reversal symmetry is not broken , and the hamiltonian of the system remains    invariant under time reversal operation .",
    "mathematically it is expressed as @xmath157=0 $ ] , where @xmath158 is the time reversal operator .",
    "the rashba hamiltonian ( @xmath159 ) is usually written as , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , @xmath162 being the complex conjugation operator . the second quantized form of eq .",
    "( [ equ33 ] ) is given by the fourth and fifth terms of eq .",
    "( [ equ2 ] ) . as electrons are spin-@xmath163 particles , so following kramer s theorem , each eigenstate is at least two - fold degenerate and spin is no longer a good quantum number in the presence of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "_ in many cases the degeneracy implied by kramer s theorem is merely the degeneracy between states of spin up and spin down , or something equally obvious .",
    "the theorem is non - trivial for a system with spin - orbit coupling in an unsymmetrical electric field , so that neither nor angular momentum is conserved .",
    "kramer s theorem implies that no such field can split the degenerate pairs of energy levels _  @xcite .",
    "however , the degeneracy can be removed by applying external magnetic flux or magnetic field as in this case time reversal symmetry is not conserved anymore and therefore spin polarization can be achieved .",
    "the degree of polarization of the transmitted electrons is conventionally defined as , @xmath164    for our illustrative purpose , in fig .",
    "[ filter ] we plot the variations of conductances as a function of energy for a diamond network with three plaquettes considering @xmath165 and @xmath102 .",
    "a significant change is observed in the magnitudes of spin conserved conductances ( @xmath105 and @xmath107 ) ( fig .",
    "[ filter](a ) ) , while the spin flip conductances ( @xmath166 and @xmath147 ) are identical as shown in fig .",
    "[ filter](b ) . therefore ,",
    "applying a non - zero flux spin polarization is clearly obtained .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ equ27 ] ) we calculate the degree of polarization for an arbitrary energy @xmath167 ( say ) , and it is about @xmath168 .",
    "to conclude , in the present work we have explored spin dependent transport through an array of diamonds where rashba so interaction is present and each diamond plaquette is threaded by an ab flux @xmath0 .",
    "the diamond chain is directly coupled to two semi - infinite @xmath3d non - magnetic metallic leads , namely , source and drain .",
    "we have adopted a discrete lattice model within the tight - binding framework to describe the system and present calculations based on green s function formalism .",
    "we have obtained analytical expression for the @xmath33-@xmath61 dispersion relation for an infinite diamond network with rashba so interaction , and , show explicitly the interplay of spin - orbit interaction and magnetic flux on its band structure .",
    "this analysis also gives insight about the presence of spin dependent localized and extended eigenstates which crucially controls the spin dependent transport through such device .",
    "this analytical study , in fact , provides us a very good understanding about the transport behavior of spins across a finite sized array of diamonds .",
    "it has been clearly established that how delocalizing effect sets in due to rashba so interaction when the ab flux @xmath0 is @xmath169 .",
    "quite interestingly we show that depending on the specific choices of so interaction strength and ab flux , the quantum network can be utilized as a spin filter .    in the present work we have ignored the effects of temperature , electron - electron correlation , electron - phonon interaction , disorder , etc .",
    "here , we set the temperature at @xmath57k , but the basic features will not change significantly even at low temperature as long as thermal energy ( @xmath170 ) is less than the average level spacing of the diamond chain . in this model",
    "it is also assumed that the two side - attached non - magnetic leads have negligible resistance .",
    "our presented results may be useful in designing spin based nano electronic devices .",
