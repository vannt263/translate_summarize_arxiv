    "numerical simulations suggested that galaxies in a compact group should merge into a single elliptical galaxy within a few gyrs , causing the compact group to disappear @xcite .",
    "@xcite also reached a similar conclusion through their study of star cluster age - dating and neutral hydrogen content in the hickson compact group 31 ; the compact group should merge into a single elliptical within 1 gyr ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the abundance of compact groups should decrease as the redshift decreases from @xmath16 to @xmath17 in the @xmath18cdm universe .",
    "however , @xcite found that the abundance of compact groups changes little with redshifts at @xmath19 , using a spectroscopically complete sample of 332 compact groups .",
    "@xcite also suggested an alternative scenario that compact groups do not merge , which predicts a constant abundance of compact groups at @xmath20 .",
    "however , this alternative scenario is based on the assumption of a universe without dark matter .",
    "@xcite suggested that compact groups replenish themselves with new members from the surrounding environment , thereby extending their lifetimes to the current epoch .",
    "the finding of @xcite , constant abundance of compact group at @xmath19 , can be explained by this replenishment model .",
    "this replenishment model is supported by several observational findings that showed that many ( @xmath21 ) compact groups are embedded in or associated with larger - scale structures @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that only 27% of compact groups are embedded in surrounding structures .",
    "unfortunately , many existing compact group catalogs suffer from some observational biases , which make them difficult to use for testing compact group formation models and for studying the relation between compact groups and their surrounding environments .",
    "for example , @xcite constructed a large sample of compact groups , from the photometric data ( @xmath22 ) of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 6 ( dr6 , * ? ? ? * ) , including 77,088 compact group candidates and their 313,508 tentative member galaxies .",
    "their sample is the largest one currently , but it is highly contaminated with interlopers ( @xmath21 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because the sample is based only on photometric information using hickson s selection criteria @xcite . to reduce this contamination , @xcite compiled the redshifts from fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo)/fast observations and from the sdss dr12 @xcite for the photometric sample of compact group galaxies in @xcite , and constructed a catalog of 332 compact groups .",
    "this catalog is currently the largest one with complete spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "however , this sample is affected by an isolation criterion from hickson s selection criteria .",
    "the isolation criterion requires that no galaxies be present in a radius of up to three times the group radius .",
    "this criterion was adopted to avoid selecting very dense regions like cluster cores , but this could introduce a bias that misses nearby compact groups with apparently large sizes and embedded systems in dense environments @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite published a new catalog of 1588 compact groups and their 5178 member galaxies at @xmath23 using sdss dr12 spectroscopic data supplemented by additional redshifts from the literature and from flwo / fast observations .",
    "they applied a friends - of - friends algorithm to identify the compact groups without using the isolation criterion . as a result",
    ", their catalog successfully contains nearby ( @xmath24 ) compact groups and embedded systems in dense regions .",
    "this is important in order to study the relation between compact groups and their surrounding environments without any sample bias .",
    "previous observational studies suggested that galaxy evolution in compact groups is faster than in the field from the comparisons of lick indices @xcite , the star formation quenching timescales @xcite , specific star formation rates ( sfrs ) distribution @xcite , and color distribution @xcite . @xcite and @xcite found that the stellar ages and the early - type galaxy fractions of compact group galaxies are similar to those of cluster galaxies , which suggests that compact group galaxies evolve as fast as cluster galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite showed that compact group galaxies exhibit a bimodal distribution in the _ spitzer _ irac ( @xmath25 @xmath2 ) color space with a statistically evident gap , so - called `` canyon '' , between star - forming galaxies with mir red colors and quiescent galaxies with mir blue colors . recently , @xcite newly identified the canyon galaxies in the _ wise _ color - color diagram .",
    "this gap may suggest the accelerated galaxy evolution in compact groups because the gap is not seen in comparison galaxy samples from field , from interacting pairs , and from the center of the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that compact group galaxies in the gap mostly show enhanced warm h@xmath26 emission from the observations with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph , which could be caused by shock heating @xcite .",
    "this result implies that shock heating may be responsible for rapid evolution of galaxies in compact groups .    however , these results are mainly based on the catalogs of compact groups selected using hickson s criteria , which can introduce a sample bias .",
    "we therefore revisit the issues on the comparison of compact groups galaxies with cluster and field galaxies using the unbiased sample of compact groups from @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we use the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _",
    "( _ wise _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mid - infrared ( mir ) data to study the environmental effects on compact group galaxies and the relation between compact groups and their surrounding environments .",
    "the mir data are useful indicators of mean stellar ages @xcite , especially for compact group galaxies that are mainly dominated by old stellar populations .",
    "red - sequence galaxies with small amounts of young ( @xmath27 gyr ) and intermediate - age ( 1 - 10 gyr ) stellar populations can be distinguished from those without the populations in mir color space @xcite .",
    "the sample we use in this paper contains 670 compact groups with 2175 member galaxies drawn from the catalog of @xcite .",
    "when we investigate the mir properties of galaxies in sections 3 and 4 , we use 1541 member galaxies detected at @xmath28 with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) greater than 3 . this sample is larger than those of previous mir studies .",
    "for example , the samples of @xcite and several previous studies @xcite have less than 50 compact groups , the sample of @xcite has 99 compact groups and 348 member galaxies , and the sample of @xcite has 163 compact groups and 567 member galaxies .",

    "similarly , among compact group late - type galaxies , the fraction of massive populations with @xmath309 ( @xmath310 ) is @xmath311 , which is larger than the @xmath312 for the cluster late - type galaxy sample and the @xmath313 for the field late - type galaxy sample .",
    "this result suggests that compact groups are an ideal environment for efficient mass build - up of galaxies .          in section 3.3 ,",
    "as shown in figure [ w13abhist_nbg ] , we find that compact groups have larger @xmath228 and bluer mir colors as their surrounding environments are denser ( larger @xmath223 ) . to further investigate the effects of the surrounding environments on the physical properties of compact group member galaxies , we compare the properties of neighboring galaxies around each compact group with those of the compact group member galaxies .",
    "we calculate @xmath228 , mean @xmath91 ( @xmath314 ) , and mean @xmath3-[12]$ ] ( @xmath315-[12]}$ ] ) for neighboring galaxies in the comoving cylinder of each compact group .",

    "triangles indicate the mean values of the three parameters in @xmath223 bins . as @xmath223 increases ,",
    "neighboring galaxies have larger @xmath228 , redder optical colors , and bluer mir colors . for comparison , we compute @xmath228 , @xmath314 , and @xmath315-[12]}$ ] for member galaxies of each compact group .",
    "squares represent the mean values for the three parameters of compact group member galaxies .",
    "we find that the two mean curves show a similar pattern in all three panels .",
    "the @xmath223-dependence of @xmath228 , @xmath314 , and @xmath315-[12]}$ ] for neighboring galaxies is consistent with the morphology - density or the sfr - density relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is interesting that the similar trends are also seen for compact group member galaxies .",
    "since compact groups are very small in size ( the mean size is @xmath316 kpc ) , their internal galaxy number densities are much higher than the surrounding densities .",
    "the mean internal density of compact groups , measured by the number of members divided by the sizes of the groups , is @xmath317 mpc@xmath318 , which is much higher than the mean surrounding density , @xmath319 mpc@xmath318 , from @xmath223 .",
    "moreover , the internal galaxy number densities of compact groups do not depend on the surrounding galaxy number densities .",
    "thus , the @xmath223-dependence of the properties of compact group member galaxies can not be explained by the morphology - density or sfr - density relations alone .",
    "the similar @xmath223-dependence for compact group member galaxies and their neighboring galaxies suggests that the properties of compact group galaxies are related to those of their neighboring galaxies .",
    "if the physical properties of compact group galaxies are independent of their neighboring galaxies , the two mean curves would show different behaviors .",
    "a plausible scenario would be that the neighboring galaxies are sources of member galaxies in compact groups .",
    "this supports the idea of @xcite that compact groups replenish their members from surrounding environments , so that they do not disappear by mergers within a few gyrs .",
    "previous studies have supported this replenishment model by showing that many ( @xmath21 ) compact groups are associated with larger - scale galaxy structures that may supply new members of compact groups . on the other hand ,",
    "our finding is more direct observational evidence that the replenishment occurs regardless of the surrounding density of compact groups .",
    "an important point is that compact groups are not simply aggregates of captured neighboring galaxies .",
    "figure [ nbg_bg_properties ] shows that the two mean curves do not overlap , but differ systematically .",
    "this result suggests that there are additional environmental effects playing a critical role in morphology transformation and star formation quenching for compact group galaxies , which probably results from frequent interactions among member galaxies .",
    "this result also suggests that compact groups are the most suitable environment for the pre - processing @xcite .",
    "we find that the mir colors of late - type galaxies are bluer in the @xmath266 compact groups than in the @xmath265 compact groups ( figure [ w13_efrac_lgal ] ) .",
    "this @xmath228 dependence is still found when @xmath223 or @xmath229 is fixed ( see figures [ w13abhist_vdisp_efrac ] and [ w13abhist_nbg_efrac_lgal ] ) , indicating that among the three environmental parameters , @xmath228 could be the most important parameter in determining the mir colors of late - type member galaxies .",
    "the @xmath3-[12]$ ] colors of late - type galaxies are well correlated with specific sfrs @xcite .",
    "thus , this finding suggests that star formation activity of late - type galaxies is suppressed more efficiently in the @xmath266 compact groups than in the @xmath265 compact groups .",
    "moreover , the suppression of star formation activity is stronger in the @xmath266 compact groups than in the cluster central ( @xmath287 ) regions ( figure [ w13_efrac_lgal ] ) .",
    "@xcite showed that late - type galaxies in the @xmath259 compact groups tend to have smaller specific sfrs than those in the @xmath257 compact groups .",
    "their result seems similar to our result . to verify their result with our sample , we divide our compact group sample into the @xmath265 , @xmath320 , and @xmath259 compact groups .",
    "the large values ( @xmath321 ) of @xmath157 and @xmath158 can not reject the null hypothesis for two mir color distributions for late - type galaxies in the @xmath320 compact groups and for late - type galaxies in the @xmath259 compact groups .",
    "however , the @xmath322 and @xmath323 reject the null hypothesis for two mir color distributions for late - type galaxies in the @xmath265 compact groups and for late - type galaxies in the @xmath320 compact groups at a significance @xmath324 .",
    "these suggest that the @xmath265 and @xmath320 compact groups in our sample have statistically different mir color distributions for their late - type member galaxies , which supports again our finding that mir colors of late - type galaxies are bluer in the @xmath266 compact groups than in the @xmath265 compact groups . the different @xmath228 criterion between this study and bitsakis et al .",
    "probably results from different compact group samples .",
    "an important point here is that the star formation activity of late - type galaxies in compact groups is suppressed when the groups contain early - type members .",
    "this suppression of star formation activity can not be explained by gravitational interactions among member galaxies alone . @xcite and @xcite found that galaxy properties strongly depend on the distance and morphology of the nearest neighbor galaxy , using spectroscopic samples drawn from the sdss data .",
    "they showed that when a galaxy is located within the virial radius of its nearest neighbor galaxy , the galaxy tends to have a morphological type similar to that of the neighbor galaxy .",
    "however , this phenomenon does not manifest if the distance to the neighbor is greater than the virial radius of the neighbor .",
    "they suggested that the phenomenon is due to hydrodynamic interactions , and that the effects of hydrodynamic interactions are significant to change the morphology and star formation activity of galaxies when the galaxies are located within the virial radii of their neighbor galaxies .",
    "the sizes of compact groups ( the mean value is 30.7 kpc ) are significantly smaller than virial radii of member galaxies ( i.e. , 430 kpc and 340 kpc for early- and late - type galaxies with @xmath325 , * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that compact group member galaxies are already located within the virial radius of each other , and that they interact hydrodynamically each other .",
    "@xcite focused on the case of galaxies located within the virial radii of massive galaxy clusters , and found that even in cluster environments the hydrodynamic interactions with early - type neighbor galaxies are the main drivers of star formation quenching of late - type galaxies .",
    "they also found that the effects of the cluster hot gas on the star formation quenching of galaxies at @xmath326 is insignificant compared to the effects of hydrodynamic interactions with neighbor galaxies .",
    "unlike cluster environments , hot gas of compact groups is not in a hydrostatic equilibrium state , and it is likely to be associated with the individual galaxies or brightest galaxies @xcite , suggesting that hydrodynamic effects from hot gas are insignificant in compact groups .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the suppressed star formation activity of late - type galaxies in the @xmath266 compact groups likely results from hydrodynamic interactions with early - type member galaxies .",
    "we study the mir properties of galaxies in compact groups and their environmental dependence using a volume - limited sample of 670 compact groups and their 2175 member galaxies with @xmath65 and @xmath1 , drawn from the catalog of @xcite .",
    "this catalog was derived from nearly complete redshift survey data , and was constructed by applying a friends - of - friends method without applying hickson s isolation criterion , which make the catalog include nearby compact groups and embedded compact groups in high - density regions that were often excluded from previous catalogs . using this unbiased compact group sample ,",
    "we perform a study comparing the physical properties of galaxies in compact groups with those of galaxies in other environments such as galaxy clusters and the field .",
    "we use three environmental parameters including @xmath223 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 to represent the internal and external environment of the compact groups .",
    "our key findings of this study are summarized as follows .    *",
    "the mir colors of compact group early - type galaxies are on average bluer than those of cluster ( @xmath287 ) early - type galaxies regardless of @xmath223 , @xmath228 , and @xmath327 .",
    "this suggests that early - type galaxies in compact groups are on average older than those of cluster galaxies . *",
    "the mir colors of the late - type galaxies in the @xmath266 compact groups tend to be bluer than those of cluster late - type galaxies .",
    "these suggests that the star formation activity of late - type galaxies is suppressed more efficiently in @xmath266 compact groups than in clusters . * as @xmath223 increases , compact groups have larger @xmath228 , redder optical colors , and bluer mir colors .",
    "these trends are also seen for neighboring galaxies around compact groups .",
    "considering the extremely high galaxy number densities in compact group environments , this similar @xmath223-dependence for compact group member galaxies and their neighboring galaxies is not well explained by the morphology- and sfr - density relations .",
    "this result can be explained by the scenario that neighboring galaxies are sources of member galaxies in compact groups , supporting the replenishment model suggested by @xcite .",
    "* at a given @xmath223 , compact group members always have on average larger @xmath228 and bluer mir colors than neighboring galaxies .",
    "this suggests that compact groups are not simply aggregates of captured neighboring galaxies , and that compact group environments play a critical role in accelerating morphology transformation and star formation quenching for the member galaxies . * in the @xmath265 compact groups , the mir colors of late - type galaxies are on average redder than those of cluster late - type galaxies .",
    "however , in the @xmath266 compact groups , the mir colors of late - type galaxies are on average bluer than those in cluster late - type galaxies .",
    "this indicates that star formation quenching occurs more effectively in compact groups than in clusters when compact groups have early - type members .",
    "this suppressed star formation activity of late - type galaxies likely results from hydrodynamic interactions with early - type member galaxies .",
