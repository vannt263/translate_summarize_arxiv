    "physical systems at thermal equilibrium are usually homogeneous .",
    "this is the case for gases with short range intermolecular forces ( and in absence of external fields ) . when long range interactions as the gravitational force are present even the ground state is often inhomogeneous . in this case , each element of the substance is acted on by very strong forces due to distant particles of the gas .",
    "hence regions near to and far from the boundary of the volume occupied by the gas will be in very different conditions and as a result the homogeneity of the gas is destroyed @xcite .",
    "this basic inhomogeneity suggests that fractal structures can arise in a self - interacting gravitational gas@xcite .",
    "let us review very briefly our recent work @xcite on the statistical properties of a self - interacting gravitational gas in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we discussed two relevant astrophysical applications of such gas : the cold interstellar medium ( ism ) and the galaxy distributions .    in the grand canonical ensemble , we showed that the self - gravitating gas is exactly equivalent to a field theory of a single scalar field @xmath20 with exponential self - interaction .",
    "we analyzed this field theory perturbatively and non - perturbatively through the renormalization group approach .",
    "we showed * scaling * behaviour ( critical ) for a continuous range of the temperature and of the other physical parameters .",
    "we derive in this framework the scaling relation @xmath21 for the mass on a region of size @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for the velocity dispersion where @xmath24 . for the density - density correlations",
    "we find a power - law behaviour for large distances @xmath25 the fractal dimension @xmath26 turns to be related with the critical exponent @xmath27 of the correlation length by @xmath28 mean field theory yields for the scaling exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 . such values are compatible with the present ism observational data : @xmath31 .",
    "we developed in ref.@xcite a field theoretical approach to the galaxy distribution .",
    "we consider a gas of self - gravitating masses on the friedman - robertson - walker background , in quasi - thermal equilibrium .",
    "we derive the galaxy correlations using renormalization group methods .",
    "we find that the connected @xmath6-points density correlator @xmath32 scales as @xmath33 when @xmath34 .",
    "there are no free parameters in this theory .",
    "our study of the statistical mechanics of a self - gravitating system indicates that gravity provides a dynamical mechanism to produce fractal structure .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we summarize the main properties of the ism , in section iii we review the relevant aspects of the large scale structure of the universe , in sec .",
    "iv we develop the statistical mechanics of the self - gravitating gas in the canonical ensemble .",
    "discussion and remarks are presented in section v.",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a gas essentially formed by atomic ( hi ) and molecular ( @xmath35 ) hydrogen , distributed in cold ( @xmath36 ) clouds , in a very inhomogeneous and fragmented structure .",
    "these clouds are confined in the galactic plane and in particular along the spiral arms .",
    "they are distributed in a hierarchy of structures , of observed masses from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "the morphology and kinematics of these structures are traced by radio astronomical observations of the hi hyperfine line at the wavelength of 21 cm , and of the rotational lines of the co molecule ( the fundamental line being at 2.6 mm in wavelength ) , and many other less abundant molecules .",
    "structures have been measured directly in emission from 0.01pc to 100pc , and there is some evidence in vlbi ( very long based interferometry ) hi absorption of structures as low as @xmath39 au ( 3 @xmath40 ) .",
    "the mean density of structures is roughly inversely proportional to their sizes , and vary between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( significantly above the mean density of the ism which is about @xmath43 or @xmath44 )",
    ". observations of the ism revealed remarkable relations between the mass , the radius and velocity dispersion of the various regions , as first noticed by larson @xcite , and since then confirmed by many other independent observations ( see for example ref.@xcite ) . from a compilation of well established samples of data for many different types of molecular clouds of maximum linear dimension ( size ) @xmath22 ,",
    "total mass @xmath45 and internal velocity dispersion @xmath46 in each region : @xmath47 over a large range of cloud sizes , with @xmath48 @xmath49 these * scaling * relations indicate a hierarchical structure for the molecular clouds which is independent of the scale over the above cited range ; above @xmath1 pc in size , corresponding to giant molecular clouds , larger structures will be destroyed by galactic shear .",
    "these relations appear to be * universal * , the exponents @xmath50 are almost constant over all scales of the galaxy , and whatever be the observed molecule or element .",
    "these properties of interstellar cold gas are supported first at all from observations ( and for many different tracers of cloud structures : dark globules using @xmath51co , since the more abundant isotopic species @xmath52co is highly optically thick , dark cloud cores using @xmath53 or @xmath54 as density tracers , giant molecular clouds using @xmath52co , hi to trace more diffuse gas , and even cold dust emission in the far - infrared ) .",
    "nearby molecular clouds are observed to be fragmented and self - similar in projection over a range of scales and densities of at least @xmath55 , and perhaps up to @xmath56 .",
    "the physical origin as well as the interpretation of the scaling relations ( [ vobser ] ) are not theoretically understood .",
    "the theoretical derivation of these relations has been the subject of many proposals and controversial discussions .",
    "it is not our aim here to account for all the proposed models of the ism and we refer the reader to refs.@xcite for a review .",
    "the physics of the ism is complex , especially when we consider the violent perturbations brought by star formation .",
    "energy is then poured into the ism either mechanically through supernovae explosions , stellar winds , bipolar gas flows , etc .. or radiatively through star light , heating or ionising the medium , directly or through heated dust .",
    "relative velocities between the various fragments of the ism exceed their internal thermal speeds , shock fronts develop and are highly dissipative ; radiative cooling is very efficient , so that globally the ism might be considered isothermal on large - scales .",
    "whatever the diversity of the processes , the universality of the scaling relations suggests a common mechanism underlying the physics .",
    "we propose that self - gravity is the main force at the origin of the structures , that can be perturbed locally by heating sources .",
    "observations are compatible with virialised structures at all scales .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that the molecular clouds ensemble is in isothermal equilibrium with the cosmic background radiation at @xmath57 in the outer parts of galaxies , devoid of any star and heating sources @xcite .",
    "this colder isothermal medium might represent the ideal frame to understand the role of self - gravity in shaping the hierarchical structures .",
    "our aim is to show that the scaling laws obtained are then quite stable to perturbations .",
    "till now , no theoretical derivation of the scaling laws eq.([vobser ] ) has been provided in which the values of the exponents are * obtained * from the theory ( and not just taken from outside or as a starting input or hypothesis ) .",
    "the aim of our work @xcite is to develop a theory of the cold ism .",
    "a first step in this goal was to provide a theoretical derivation of the scaling laws eq.([vobser ] ) , in which the values of the exponents @xmath50 are * obtained * from the theory@xcite .",
    "for this purpose , we implemented for the ism the powerful tool of field theory and the wilson s approach to critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "one obvious feature of galaxy and cluster distributions in the sky is their hierarchical property : galaxies gather in groups , that are embedded in clusters , then in superclusters , and so on@xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the galaxy and cluster correlations allows a more precise characterization of their distributions .",
    "unfortunately , the most widely spread two point correlation function @xmath58 in galaxy distributions studies , is based on the assumption that the universe reaches homogeneity on a scale smaller than the sample size .",
    "@xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number density of galaxies , and @xmath61 is the volume average ( over @xmath62 ) .",
    "the length @xmath63 is defined by @xmath64 .",
    "the function @xmath58 has a power - law behaviour of slope @xmath65 for @xmath66 , then it turns down to zero rather quickly at the statitistical limit of the sample .",
    "this rapid fall leads to an over - estimate of the small - scale @xmath67 .",
    "one finds the slope @xmath67 , the same for galaxies and clusters , of @xmath68 1.7 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown in refs.@xcite and @xcite that the homogeneity hypothesis could perturb significantly the results .",
    "pietronero @xcite introduces the conditional density @xmath69 which is the average density around an occupied point . for a fractal medium , where the mass depends on the size as @xmath70 @xmath71 being the fractal ( haussdorf ) dimension",
    ", the conditional density behaves as @xmath72 this is exactly the statistical analysis used for the interstellar clouds , since the ism astronomers have not adopted from the start any large - scale homogeneity assumption ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the fact that for a fractal the correlation @xmath58 can be highly misleading is readily seen since @xmath73 and for a fractal structure the average density of the sample @xmath74 is a decreasing function of the sample length scale . in the general use of @xmath58",
    ", @xmath74 is taken for a constant , and we can see that @xmath75 if for very small scales , both @xmath58 and @xmath76 have the same power - law behaviour , with the same slope @xmath65 , then the slope appears to steepen for @xmath58 when approaching the length @xmath63 .",
    "this explains why with a correct statistical analysis @xcite , the actual @xmath77 is smaller than that obtained using @xmath58 .",
    "this also explains why the amplitude of @xmath58 and @xmath63 increases with the sample size , and for clusters as well .",
    "this scale - invariance has suggested very early the idea of fractal models for the clustering hierachy of galaxies @xcite . since then",
    ", many authors have shown that a fractal distribution indeed reproduces quite well the aspect of galaxy catalogs , for example by simulating a fractal and observing it , as with a telescope @xcite .",
    "there is some ambiguity in the definition of the two - point correlation function @xmath58 above , since it depends on the assumed scale beyond which the universe is homogeneous ; indeed it includes a normalisation by the average density of the universe , which , if the homogeneity scale is not reached , depends on the size of the galaxy sample . once @xmath58 is defined , one can always determine a length @xmath63 where @xmath78 = 1 @xcite . for galaxies ,",
    "the most frequently reported value is @xmath79 mpc ( where @xmath80/100 km s@xmath81mpc@xmath81 ) , but it has been shown to increase with the distance limits of galaxy catalogs @xcite , @xmath63 is called ` correlation length ' in the galaxy literature . [",
    "the notion of correlation length @xmath82 is usually different in physics , where @xmath82 characterizes the exponential decay of correlations @xmath83 . for power",
    "decaying correlations , it is said that the correlation length is infinite ] .",
    "the same problem occurs for the two - point correlation function of galaxy clusters ; the corresponding @xmath58 has the same power law as galaxies , their length @xmath63 has been reported to be about @xmath84 mpc , and their correlation amplitude is therefore about 15 times higher than that of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the latter is difficult to understand , unless there is a considerable difference between galaxies belonging to clusters and field galaxies ( or morphological segregation ) .",
    "the other obvious explanation is that the normalizing average density of the universe was then chosen lower .",
    "this statistical analysis of the galaxy catalogs has been criticized in refs.@xcite , who stress the unconfortable dependence of @xmath58 and of the length @xmath63 upon the finite size of the catalogs , and on the _ a priori _ assumed value of the large - scale homogeneity cut - off .",
    "a way to circumvent these problems is to deal instead with the average density as a function of size .",
    "it has been shown that the galaxy distribution behaves as a pure self - similar fractal over scales up to @xmath85 mpc , the deepest scale to which the data are statistically robust @xcite .",
    "this is more consistent with the observation of contrasted large - scale structures , such as superclusters , large voids or great walls of galaxies of @xmath86 mpc @xcite after a proper statistical analysis of all available catalogs ( cfa , ssrs , iras , apm , leda , etc .. for galaxies , and abell and aco for clusters ) pietronero et al @xcite state that the transition to homogeneity might not yet have been reached up to the deepest scales probed until now . at best , this point is quite controversial , and the large - scale homogeneity transition is not yet well known .",
    "isotropy and homogeneity are expected at very large scales from the cosmological principle ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , this does not imply local or mid - scale homogeneity ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a fractal structure can be locally isotropic , but inhomogeneous . the main observational evidence in favor of the cosmological principle is the remarkable isotropy of the cosmic background radiation ( e.g. @xcite ) , that provides information about the universe at the matter / radiation decoupling .",
    "there must therefore exist a transition between the small - scale fractality to large - scale homogeneity .",
    "this transition is certainly smooth , and might correspond to the transition from linear perturbations to the non - linear gravitational collapse of structures .",
    "the present catalogs do not yet see the transition since they do not look up sufficiently back in time . it can be noticed that some recent surveys begin to see a different power - law behavior at large scales ( @xmath87 mpc , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are several approaches to understand non - linear clustering , and therefore the distribution of galaxies , in an infinite gravitating system .",
    "numerical simulations have been widely used , in the hope to trace back from the observations the initial mass spectrum of fluctuations , and to test postulated cosmologies such as cdm and related variants ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "[ that is numerically solving newton s equations of motion of self - gravitating particles ] .",
    "this approach has not yet yielded definite results , especially since the physics of the multiple - phase universe is not well known . also numerical limitations ( restricted dynamical range due to the softening and limited volume )",
    "have often masked the expected self - similar behavior .",
    "we presented in @xcite a new approach based on field theory and the renormalisation group to understand the clustering behaviour of a self - gravitating expanding universe .",
    "we also consider the thermodynamics properties of the system , assuming quasi - equilibrium for the range of scales concerned with the non - linear regime and virialisation .",
    "using statistical field theory , the renormalisation group and the finite - size scaling ideas , we determined the scaling behaviour .",
    "the small - scale fractal universe can be considered critical with large density fluctuations developing at any scale .",
    "we derived the corresponding critical exponents which yielded the fractal dimension @xmath71 .",
    "it is very close to those measured on galaxy catalogs through statistical methods based on the average density as function of size ; these methods reveal in particular a fractal dimension @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "this fractal dimension is strikingly close to that observed for the interstellar medium or ism ( e.g. @xcite ) we showed in ref.@xcite that the theoretical framework based on self - gravity that we have developped for the ism @xcite is also a dynamical mechanism leading to the fractal structure of the universe .",
    "this theory is powerfully predictive without any free parameter .",
    "it allowed to compute the @xmath6-points density correlations without any extra assumption@xcite .",
    "we investigate in this section a gas formed by @xmath6 non - relativistic particles with mass @xmath89 interacting only through newtonian gravity and which are in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath90 .",
    "we shall work in the canonical ensemble assuming the gas being on a cubic box of side @xmath91 .",
