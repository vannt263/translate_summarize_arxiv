    "investors are exposed to _ credit risk _ , or _",
    "counterparty risk _ , due to the possibility that one or more counterparties in a financial agreement will default ; that is , not honor their obligations to make certain payments .",
    "counterparty risk has to be taken into account when pricing a transaction or portfolio , and it is necessary to model the occurrence of default jointly with the behavior of asset values .",
    "the default time is sometimes modeled as the first passage time of a credit index process below a barrier .",
    "black and cox @xcite were among the first to use this approach .",
    "they define the time of default as the first time the ratio of the value of a firm and the value of its debt falls below a constant level , and they model debt as a zero - coupon bond and the value of the firm as a geometric brownian motion . in this case , the default time has the distribution of the first - passage time of a brownian motion ( with constant drift ) below a certain barrier .",
    "hull and white @xcite model the default time as the first time a brownian motion hits a given time - dependent barrier .",
    "they show that this model gives the correct market credit default swap and bond prices if the time - dependent barrier is chosen so that the first passage time of the brownian motion has a certain distribution derived from those prices .",
    "given a distribution for the default time , it is usually impossible to find a closed - form expression for the corresponding time - dependent barrier , and numerical methods have to be used .",
    "we adopt a perspective similar to that of @xcite .",
    "namely , we model the default time as @xmath10 where the diffusion @xmath11 is some credit index process , @xmath12 is an independent mean one exponentially distributed random variable , @xmath13 is a suitably smooth , non - increasing function with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is a rate parameter .",

    "that is , @xmath22 when the credit index value @xmath23 is large , corresponding to a time @xmath24 when the counterparty is in sound financial health , the killing rate @xmath25 is close to @xmath26 and default in an ensuing short period of time is unlikely , whereas the killing rate is close to its maximum possible value , @xmath5 , when @xmath23 is low and default is more probable . note that if we consider a family of @xmath27$]-valued , non - increasing functions @xmath7 that converges to the indicator function of the set @xmath28 and @xmath5 tends to @xmath29 , then the corresponding stopping time @xmath18 converges to the hull and white stopping time @xmath30 .",
