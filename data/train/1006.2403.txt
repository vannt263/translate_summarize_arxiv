    "forward error - correcting codes have played an instrumental role in the many successes of digital communications over the past decades  @xcite .",
    "the fact that it is possible to transmit digital information reliably at a positive rate over an unknown noisy channel is now universally acknowledged  @xcite .",
    "the main cost of improving reliability is the use of increasingly long codewords  @xcite .",
    "one situation where the valuable lessons of classical coding theory may not apply directly is the general area of delay - constrained communications .",
    "if system specifications dictate that almost all information bits should be made available at the destination shortly after they arrived at the transmitter , it may not be possible to aggregate a large number of them before encoding and transmission . in some cases",
    ", stringent delay requirements will force a system designer to resort to short block codes or short constraint - length convolutional codes .    from a coding perspective , using short codewords on channels with memory creates two impediments .",
    "first , decoders are designed to correct the most - likely error patterns and the probability of seeing atypical error patterns can not be neglected for short block lengths .",
    "second , if the coherence time of the channel is longer than a codeword transmission interval , then optimal code rate may depend heavily on the channel state , which is unknown to the transmitter .",
    "together , these factors impair the rapid transmission of information .",
    "coding performance as a function of block - length and code - rate has been assessed in the information theory literature using the reliability function  @xcite .",
    "this criterion focuses on the exponential rate at which the error probability decays with block length , known as the error exponent , as a function of information rate .",
    "the concept of a reliability function can also be extended to variable - length codes in the presence of feedback  @xcite .",
    "more recently , consideration has been given to the reliability function for bits with fixed delay , as opposed to coded blocks , in the presence of feedback  @xcite .    while remarkable , these results remain asymptotic in nature and do not necessarily capture overall system behavior adequately .",
    "for delay - sensitive applications and short codewords , three interrelated effects come into play .",
    "the probability of decoding failure for every codeword is not negligible .",
    "packet retransmissions lead to queue buildups at the source and , thereby , induce longer latencies .",
    "channel correlation over time introduces dependencies among successive decoding attempts , which further perturb queueing behavior and end - to - end delay .",
    "this is especially true when decoding failures are likely to occur in sequence  @xcite .",
    "thus , a queueing analysis is necessary when considering the behavior of communication systems subject to very stringent delay requirements .    for delay - sensitive systems with short codewords ,",
    "the natural tradeoff between code - rate and probability of decoding failure is hard to characterize  @xcite . in a non - asymptotic regime where information is queued at the source ,",
    "transmitting data at a rate slightly below shannon capacity may lead to poor performance .",
    "recent results in the literature hint at the fact that , for delay - constrained communication , optimal code - rate selection depends heavily on block - length and channel correlation  @xcite .",
    "these findings are especially important for real - time traffic and live interactive sessions , as these applications are sensitive to latency and require the use of short codewords .",
    "guidelines for code - rate selection in the context of delay - sensitive traffic were previously obtained for an erasure channel with memory  @xcite .",
    "the approach favored therein , which permits a complete characterization of queueing behavior , consists in building a markov model for the evolution of the system .",
    "crucial assumptions that facilitate analysis can be summarized as follows : the packet arrival process at the source is bernoulli , the packet lengths are i.i.d .",
    "geometric , the error protection uses random codes , and the channel evolution is governed by a markov chain .    in this article",
    ", we adopt a similar formulation and extend results that were obtained for the correlated erasure case to a more encompassing gilbert - elliot framework .",
    "this latter class of erasure channels is common to the literature on channels with memory , and subsumes earlier work based on similar concepts .",
    "we also present an in - depth analysis of system performance using different criteria that reflect the needs of various contemporary applications .",
    "this research is significant because it offers a new perspective on the selection of code - rate and block - length for delay - sensitive systems and provides a rigorous investigation into the effects of time - correlation on the queued performance of real - time wireless connections .",
    "throughout , we assume that coded bits are sent from the transmitter to the destination over a gilbert - elliot erasure channel",
    ". this channel can be in one of two states : a _ good _ state @xmath0 in which every bit is erased with probability @xmath1 and a _ bad _ state @xmath2 in which every bit is erased with probability @xmath3 , independently of other bits .",
    "our naming scheme implies @xmath4 .",
    "transitions between channel states occur according to a markov process .",
    "the probability of transitioning to state @xmath0 given that the markov chain is currently in state @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the likelihood of the reverse transition from @xmath0 to @xmath2 is symbolized by @xmath6 . under alphabetical state ordering",
    ", the parameters of this markov chain can be expressed in the form of a probability transition matrix , @xmath7 .\\ ] ] a graphical interpretation of the communication channel under consideration appears in fig .",

    "moreover , the succession of states over time , @xmath13 , forms a markov process . finding the conditional probability @xmath14 amounts to selecting an entry in @xmath15 .",
    "likewise , @xmath16 can be obtained by locating the corresponding entry in @xmath17 , the @xmath18th power of @xmath15 .",
    "we note that this markov chain converges to its stationary distribution at an exponential rate that depends on the second eigenvalue of @xmath15 ( i.e.  @xmath19 ) .    in our analysis",
    ", a packet of length @xmath20 is sectioned into @xmath21 data segments each containing @xmath22 information bits .",
    "packing loss is treated implicitly since the last data segment of each packet is zero padded to @xmath22 bits .",
    "every segment is encoded separately into a codeword of length @xmath18 , which is subsequently stored in the queue for eventual transmission over the gilbert - elliot erasure channel .",
    "decoding failures are handled through immediate retransmission of the missing data .",
    "a quantity that is of fundamental importance in our analysis is the conditional probability of decoding failure at the destination .",
    "an intermediary step in identifying this probability is to derive an expression for @xmath23 , the number of erasures within a codeword of length @xmath18 .",
    "this , in turn , depends on the number of visits to each state within @xmath18 consecutive realizations of the channel .",
    "more specifically , we are interested in conditional probabilities of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the generating function for these conditional probabilities is based on generalizing the entries of @xmath15 to the vector space of real polynomials in @xmath27 with @xmath28.\\ ] ] let @xmath29 be the operator which maps a polynomial in @xmath27 to the coefficient of @xmath30 .",
    "then , the conditional probability is given , in terms of the @xmath18th power of @xmath31 , by @xmath32_{c , d}.\\ ] ] it is worth mentioning that one can employ this method or alternative combinatorial means to obtain closed - form expressions for the desired conditional probabilities  @xcite .      during every transmission , a segment of @xmath22 information bits",
    "is encoded using a code defined by a random parity - check matrix @xmath33 of size @xmath34 , where each matrix entry is selected independently and uniformly from @xmath35 .",
    "maximum likelihood decoding is used at the destination .",
    "random coding has the benefit that the probability of decoding failure depends only on the number of erasures and not on the locations of the erasures .",
    "consequently , the decoding failure probability is a function of the number of erasures @xmath23 in the block .",
    "once the value of @xmath23 is known , we can derive the desired probability as follows .",
    "conditioned on @xmath36 , decoding at the destination will succeed if and only if the submatrix of @xmath33 formed by choosing the @xmath10 erased columns has rank @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the probability that a random @xmath37 matrix over @xmath38 , where @xmath39 stands for the number of parity bits , has rank @xmath10 is equal to @xmath40 .",
    "thus , given @xmath10 erasures within a codeword of length @xmath18 , the probability of decoding failure can be written as @xmath41    the average probability of decoding failure at the destination is therefore equal to @xmath42 $ ] , where the expectation over @xmath23 depends implicitly on all possible channel realizations within a block .",
    "while the average probability of decoding failure offers a good measure of performance , it alone does not capture the queueing behavior of the system .",
    "indeed , correlation among decoding - failure events may also alter the behavior of the queue at the transmitter .",
    "having introduced a precise model for the physical layer , we turn to the description of the arrival and departure processes at the queue . in our framework , the block - length , which we denote by @xmath18 , remains fixed throughout and every codeword transmission requires @xmath18 consecutive uses of the channel .",
    "each data packet is broken into length-@xmath22 data segments that are separately encoded into blocks . in terms of system characterization ,",
    "@xmath18 is fundamental in that it determines the sampling period of our markov chain .",
    "we assume that the packet arrival process is i.i.d .",
    "bernoulli with parameter @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that , during each codeword transmission interval , a new packet arrives at the source with probability @xmath43 .",
    "the number of bits in each data packet is assumed to be an i.i.d .",
    "random process whose marginal distribution is geometric with parameter @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the probability that a packet contains exactly @xmath45 bits becomes @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "these assumptions on the structure of the arrival process and the packet - length distribution are crucial for the construction of a tractable markov model for our communication system .",
    "they enable a rigorous analysis of the queue and lead to meaningful guidelines for system design and optimization .",
    "departures from the queue are governed by the underlying gilbert - elliot channel and the design - rate @xmath48 of our random linear code .",
    "the number of information bits contained in every codeword is therefore @xmath49 .",
    "a low - rate code will , in general , have a smaller probability of decoding failure than the same system with a higher rate code .",
    "still , the successful decoding of a codeword associated with a high - rate code leads to the transmission of a larger amount of data bits .",
    "these competing considerations create a natural tradeoff between information content and probability of decoding failure .",
    "accordingly , the code - rate @xmath50 , or equivalently the number of information bits @xmath22 , is a parameter that should be optimized .",
    "once a code rate is selected , the number of successfully decoded codewords needed to complete the transmission of a given packet is @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath20 is geometric , we find that @xmath21 also has a geometric distribution , albeit with parameter @xmath52 the probability that a data packet requires the successful transmission of @xmath53 data segments of size @xmath54 is equal to @xmath55 for a head packet to depart from the queue , the destination must successfully decode the most recent codeword it received , and this codeword must carry the final segment of information corresponding to this packet .",
    "implicit to our system model is the ability of the destination to acknowledge the reception of a codeword through instantaneous feedback .",
    "based on this side information , the transmitter is able to remove data segments and packets from the queue after successful transmission .",
    "the number of data packets in the queue at the onset of block  @xmath56 is denoted by @xmath57 .",

    "together , these two quantities form the state of our markov process , @xmath59 .",
    "we emphasize that the cardinality of this state space is countable , with @xmath60 belonging to @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , the markov chain underlying the evolution of our system possesses a special structure ; it forms an instance of a discrete - time _ quasi - birth - death process_. fortunately , there are many established techniques to study such mathematical objects .",
    "we present one possible approach in section  [ section : matrixgeometricmethod ] .",

    "we first consider conditional events @xmath67 for which @xmath68 ; admissible values for @xmath69 are then limited to values in @xmath70 .",
    "two factors can affect the length of the queue , the arrival of a new data packet and the completion of a packet transmission .",
