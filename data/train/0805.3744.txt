    "we notice that in this integral the moduli space is covered completely and only once .",
    "let us check that the s - matrix element in eq.([eq : stdd-1 ] ) has the correct normalization .",

    "this corresponds to the scattering process sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : poles ] .",
    "the three solid lines connecting with each other indicate tachyon propagations . ]    in order to obtain the singular behaviour , we perform the fourier transformation of the s - matrix element @xmath99 with respect to @xmath111 and @xmath35 , and then put the conjugate momenta @xmath112 and @xmath113 close to the mass - shell of the tachyon . in the region",

    "eq.([eq : factorization ] ) , therefore , implies that the factorization occurs in the right way in @xmath99 and thus @xmath99 has the correct normalization .",
    "it is easy to generalize the calculation above and consider more general annulus amplitudes .",
    "for example , let us consider the amplitudes with the annulus ending on the same d - brane .",
    "in this case the computations are the same as those in the case of two d - branes , except that this time the s - matrix elements are deduced from the contributions of the term quadratic in the boundary state contained only in a single @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the normalizations of the s - matrix elements become half of those in the case of two d - branes .",
    "thus we obtain the correct normalizations .",
    "we can also calculate the annulus amplitudes with any number of closed string insertions .",
    "we can compute such amplitudes by using the fact that the three - string interaction vertex overlapped by an external state reduces to the vertex operator for the state , when the external state is close to the mass - shell @xcite .",
    "therefore the computation comes down to the one we have done above .",
    "it is easy to check that the resulting s - matrix elements are expressed as an integral over the moduli space with the appropriate measure and have the correct normalizations .",
