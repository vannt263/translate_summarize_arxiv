    "removal of the emission from interstellar dust requires an interstellar medium ( ism ) template that has a well - defined zero level and correlates well with the spatial variation of ir emission in the _ cobe _ maps . before the completion of the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) survey , observations of galactic h  i emission provided the best ism template for this purpose ( puget et al .",
    "1996 ; schlegel et al . 1998 ; and hauser et al . 1998 ) .",
    "for example , hauser et al . (",
    "1998 ) determined correlations of ir intensity with galactic h  i column density for selected regions at high galactic latitude and high ecliptic latitude , using data in the dirbe 100 @xmath10 , 140 @xmath10 , and 240 @xmath10 bands .",
    "for each region and each wavelength band , the h  i  correlated component of the infrared emission was subtracted from the data .",
    "careful error analysis , including estimates of systematic error in subtraction of the interplanetary and galactic foregrounds , showed that the mean residual intensity was significantly ( more than 3@xmath2 ) greater than zero at all three wavelengths .",
    "the residual intensity passed tests for isotropy at 140 @xmath10 and 240 @xmath10 , so detection of the cib was claimed at these wavelengths .",
    "this method of subtracting galactic foreground emission is subject to error if the ratio of galactic foreground emission to galactic h  i column density varies over the region studied .",
    "such variation could occur if there is emission from dust associated with molecular or ionized gas , and this emission is not entirely correlated with h  i column density .",

    "( 2006 ) and gillmon and shull ( 2006 ) , h@xmath1 column density is expected to be negligible compared to h  i column density over a large fraction of the high latitude sky , and to account for 1% to 30% of total h column density for cirrus features brighter than @xmath11 mjy sr@xmath5 in the temperature - corrected 100 @xmath10 map of schlegel , finkbeiner , and davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "most far infrared cib determinations have used restrictions on galactic latitude , h  i column density , and/or far infrared color to exclude lines of sight that may contain significant emission from dust associated with molecular gas . on the other hand , the warm ionized medium ( wim )",
    "is known to be prevalent at high galactic latitudes .",
    "available data indicates that h  ii column density is on average about one - third of h  i column density ( reynolds 1991a ) , and correlation studies using h@xmath0 as a tracer suggest that a significant fraction of the h  ii is not spatially correlated with h  i ( e.g. , reynolds et al .",
    "1995 , arendt et al .",
    "1998 , lagache et al .",
    "the ionized gas is expected to be subject to approximately the same interstellar radiation field as the neutral gas , and the depletion study of howk and savage ( 1999 ) shows that the dust  to  gas mass ratio in the wim may be similar to that in the warm neutral medium .",
    "thus , the infrared emissivity per h nucleus may be similar in the ionized and diffuse h  i phases of the ism , and infrared emission from the ionized phase may have a significant effect on any cib determination that is solely based on correlation with an h  i template .",
    "the paucity of tracers of the ionized gas at high latitudes precluded any definitive measurement of the amount of ir emission from dust in this gas phase .",

    ". models of the spatial distribution of the interstellar radiation field at visual and ultraviolet wavelengths predict that the mean intensity increases with increasing @xmath94 up to about 200 pc , as light from distant stars in the galactic disk becomes less attenuated , and then decreases with further increase in @xmath94 due to geometrical dilution .",
