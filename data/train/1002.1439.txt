    "the _ kissing number _ @xmath0 is the highest number of equal nonoverlapping spheres in @xmath1 that touch another sphere of the same size . in three dimensions the kissing number problem is asking how many white billiard balls can _ kiss _ ( touch ) a black ball .",
    "the most symmetrical configuration , 12 balls around another , is achieved if the 12 balls are placed at positions corresponding to the vertices of a regular icosahedron concentric with the central ball .",
    "however , these 12 outer balls do not kiss each other and may all be moved freely .",
    "so perhaps if you moved all of them to one side , a 13th ball would possibly fit in ?",
    "this problem was the subject of the famous discussion between isaac newton and david gregory in 1694 ( may 4 , 1694 ; see @xcite for details of this discussion ) .",
    "most reports say that newton believed the answer was 12 balls , while gregory thought that 13 might be possible . however , casselman @xcite found some puzzling features in this story .    this problem",
    "is often called the _ thirteen spheres problem_. hoppe @xcite thought he had solved the problem ( 1874 ) .",
    "but there was a mistake - an analysis of this mistake was published by hales in 1994 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally this problem was solved by schtte and van der waerden in 1953 @xcite .",
    "a subsequent two - page sketch of an elegant proof was given by leech @xcite in 1956 .",
    "leech s proof was presented in the first edition of the well - known book by aigner and ziegler @xcite , the authors removed this chapter from the second edition because a complete proof would have to include so much spherical trigonometry .",
    "the thirteen spheres problem continues to be of interest , and new proofs have been published in the last several years by hsiang @xcite , maehara @xcite ( this proof is based on leech s proof ) , brczky @xcite , anstreicher @xcite , and musin @xcite .    note that for @xmath2 the kissing number problem is solved only for @xmath3 @xcite , and for @xmath4 @xcite ( see @xcite for a beautiful exposition of this problem ) .",
    "if @xmath5 unit spheres kiss the unit sphere in @xmath1 , then the set of kissing points is an arrangement on the central sphere such that the ( euclidean ) distance between any two points is at least 1 .",
    "so the kissing number problem can be stated in other way : how many points can be placed on the surface of @xmath6 so that the angular separation between any two points be at least @xmath7 ?",
    "this leads to an important generalization : a finite subset @xmath8 of @xmath6 is called a _",
    "spherical @xmath9-code _ if for every pair @xmath10 of @xmath8 with @xmath11 its angular distance @xmath12 is at least @xmath9 .",

    "the problem was first asked by the dutch botanist tammes @xcite ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.6 : problem 6 ) ) , who was led to this problem by examining the distribution of openings on the pollen grains of different flowers .",
    "the tammes problem is presently solved only for several values of @xmath5 : for @xmath19 by l. fejes tth @xcite ; for @xmath20 by schtte and van der waerden @xcite ; for @xmath21 by danzer @xcite ( for @xmath22 see also brczky @xcite ) ; and for @xmath23 by robinson @xcite .",
    "the first unsolved case of the tammes problem is @xmath24 , which is particularly interesting because of its relation to the kissing problem and the kepler conjecture @xcite .",
    "actually this problem is equivalent to _ the strong thirteen spheres problem _ , which asks to find an arrangement and the maximum radius of 13 equal size nonoverlapping spheres in @xmath25 touching the unit sphere .",
