    "according to a more traditional understanding of solid - state physics , the effects of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) are small relativistic corrections that can be neglected in most materials .",
    "however , the recent synthesis of a growing number of materials where soc is a non - negligible order - one effect  @xcite has substantially changed this perspective . in magnetic systems , soc generally leads to anisotropic spin interactions that may induce novel types of quantum phases and quasiparticles .",
    "a famous example is the analytically solvable kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with its characteristic bond - dependent ising interactions , giving rise to a spin liquid phase and emergent majorana excitations  @xcite .",
    "possible candidate materials  @xcite to realize such physics in nature exhibit heavy magnetic ions which increase the magnitude of soc .",
    "another type of magnetic anisotropy induced by soc is the off - diagonal and antisymmetric dm interaction @xcite which does not primarily depend on the atomic number @xmath4 but crucially relies on the lattice geometry .",
    "it appears whenever the center of a bond connecting two magnetic ions is not an inversion center of the underlying lattice .",
    "in contrast to the anisotropic ising interactions of the kitaev model , dm couplings usually induce magnetic orders of non - collinear type and may stabilize exotic spin arrangements such as spiral orders or skyrmions @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest two - dimensional lattices where dm exchange is a symmetry - allowed interaction even on nearest - neighbor bonds is the kagome lattice , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dmkagome](a ) .",
    "built of a network of corner - sharing triangles , it is at the same time a paradigmatic example for a strongly frustrated lattice .",
    "there is indeed a wealth of evidence from different numerical methods that the antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the kagome lattice features a magnetically disordered ground state which might even realize a quantum spin liquid  @xcite . given its tendency to induce magnetic order ,",
    "the dm interaction is , hence , an important perturbation of the kagome lattice that could alter the ground state significantly .",
    "one of the prime questions is whether and at which strength the dm exchange can destroy the presumed spin - liquid phase .",
    "numerical studies such as exact diagonalization indicate that the non - magnetic phase survives up to a ratio of the nearest - neighbor dm and heisenberg interactions of @xmath5 , giving way to a magnetically ordered @xmath6 state above this value  @xcite .",
    "apart from its theoretical importance as a generic frustrated spin system , there is also a growing number of material realizations for the kagome lattice .",
    "currently , the cleanest implementation of an antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is the mineral _ herbertsmithite _ ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , which consists of weakly coupled kagome planes of spin-@xmath8 copper ions  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the absence of any long - range magnetic order down to @xmath9  @xcite in conjunction with a very broad spinon - like excitation spectrum  @xcite renders _ herbertsmithite _ one of the most promising spin - liquid candidates synthesized so far .",
    "concerning the size of the dm interaction , esr measurements imply a relative strength of @xmath10  @xcite which , interestingly , puts this mineral exactly into the parameter regime where theory predicts the onset of magnetic order .",
    "therefore , the dm coupling may drive _ herbertsmithite _ very close to a quantum critical point , raising questions about the precise location of the phase boundaries in the experimentally relevant parameter range .    in this article , we study the effects of dm interactions on the spin-@xmath8 kagome - heisenberg model using the pffrg method which has proven to accurately describe magnetic and non - magnetic phases of frustrated quantum spin systems  @xcite . to this end , we extend the existing pffrg technique to treat systems with finite dm couplings . as shown below , the off - diagonal nature of the dm interaction generates additional vertex functions with reduced symmetries which complicates a pffrg analysis enormously as compared to diagonal exchange interactions . despite the increased computational effort for numerically evaluating the renormalization - group equations , we reach sufficiently large system sizes and frequency resolution to appropriately describe the combined effects of heisenberg and dm interactions .",
    "particularly , as a first test of its applicability , we find that the critical ratio of @xmath11 for the onset magnetic order is well reproduced , indicating that the accuracy of the pffrg is retained when finite dm interactions are added . to put the @xmath0-@xmath12 model on the kagome lattice into a broader context",
    ", we also study the full @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath12 model , where @xmath1 is the second - neighbor heisenberg interaction , and @xmath0 and @xmath1 can both be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic .",
    "the motivation for this type of extended model comes from ab initio calculations for _ herbertsmithite _ which predict a small antiferromagnetic @xmath1 coupling given by @xmath13  @xcite . within pffrg",
    ", we find that the dm interaction increases the size of all non - collinearly ordered phases of the original @xmath0-@xmath1-heisenberg model ( i.e. , @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and cuboc order ) but leaves the ferromagnetic phase unaffected . in parameter regimes which are experimentally relevant for _ herbertsmithite _ , we qualitatively reproduce the correlation profile of recent neutron - scattering experiments@xcite .",
    "however , we also find small but non - negligible indications of magnetic order in these regimes which might imply that additional sources of frustration are needed to fully capture the microscopic situation in this material .",

    "[ see [ fig : nnsus](c ) ] , we reproduce the profile that has previously been obtained by pffrg  @xcite showing the strongest signal at the boundaries of the extended brillouin zone and small maxima at the @xmath3 positions . at the same time , the flow does not display signs of an instability ( see fig .

    "turns out to be rather challenging .",
    "the reason for this is that in comparison to recent pffrg studies for heisenberg models , we use relatively small system sizes and coarse frequency grids which increases numerical oscillations due to frequency discretization .",
    "additionally , the phase transition between the non - magnetic phase and the @xmath2 phase appears to be rather smooth with a slow onset of magnetization .",
    "our best estimate for the first appearance of an instability feature is @xmath186 which also coincides with the rise of @xmath2 peaks .",
    "taken together , the change of spin correlations in conjunction with the onset of instability signatures at @xmath187 indicates that pffrg correctly reproduces the phase diagram of the @xmath0-@xmath12 model that has previously been obtained by exact diagonalization  @xcite .",

    "this model has already been studied with pffrg  @xcite . in agreement with these works ,",
    "we obtain all types of order of the classical phase diagram , but with additional non - magnetic phases opening up around the points @xmath194 and @xmath195 , see fig .  [",

    "further , our results indicate the possible existence of a narrow non - magnetic phase between ferromagnetic and cuboc regimes .",
    "compared to ref .  , the magnetically disordered phases are found to be slightly larger , possibly because we use smaller system sizes and fewer discrete frequencies which complicates the identification of magnetic instabilities .",
    "a finite dm interaction first has the biggest effect on the @xmath2 phase which is considerably enlarged upon increasing @xmath12 . at @xmath196 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagrams](b ) ] , the @xmath2 regime almost fills the whole first quadrant of the phase diagram and the non - magnetic phases around @xmath194 and @xmath195 shrink , accordingly . further increasing @xmath12 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagrams](c ) ] , we even find @xmath2 order for ferromagnetic couplings @xmath19 or @xmath197 and the @xmath3 and cuboc phases likewise undergo enlargements . as a consequence , the non - magnetic phase around @xmath198 has completely vanished at @xmath199 .",
    "note that , for all dm couplings which we have studied , the transition between ferromagnetic and @xmath3 phases remains exactly at @xmath200 ( negative @xmath1 axis ) .",
    "the precise @xmath190 intervals for the ordered phases are listed in table  [ tab : orderingangles ] .    in summary",
    ", these results show that in parameter regions where a non - collinear magnetic phase ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or cuboc order ) competes with a magnetically disordered regime , a finite dm interaction shifts the phase boundary in favor of the non - collinear state .",
    "this behavior is plausible since the dm coupling tends to induce finite angles between neighboring spins ( the largest energy gain for two dm - coupled spins is obtained for an angle of @xmath201 between them ) which generally promotes non - collinear types of order .",
    "in contrast , the ferromagnetic regime is found to remain unchanged upon increasing @xmath12 .",
    "our results further indicate that for strong enough dm couplings , non - magnetic phases die out completely on the kagome lattice .",
    "our results for the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath12 model on the kagome lattice can be used to study the microscopic coupling scenario of the mineral _ herbertsmithite _ ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the immense interest in this material mainly stems from the fact that it does not exhibit signatures of magnetic long - range down to @xmath202  @xcite but shows a diffuse , spinon - like excitation spectrum  @xcite .",
    "_ herbertsmithite _ , hence , displays all the experimental features expected from a quantum spin liquid .",
    "the spin structure factor measured with neutron scattering features the strongest signal along the edges of the extended brillouin zone which roughly resembles the momentum profile for a nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the kagome lattice .",
    "while early single - crystal neutron - scattering data did not resolve any preferred type of spin correlations along the edge  @xcite , more recent results show small peaks at the @xmath2 position  @xcite .",
    "more insights into the microscopic couplings come from esr measurements , magnetic susceptibility fittings , and the entropy difference compared to the heisenberg case which indicate a dm interaction in the range of @xmath203 @xcite . in addition , ab - initio dft calculations predict an antiferromagnetic second - neighbor interaction given by @xmath204@xcite .",
    "we have performed pffrg calculations in the vicinity of the reported values for @xmath12 and @xmath1 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : herbertsus](a ) .",
    "it should generally be emphasized that there is a strong competition between @xmath2 order and a magnetically disordered phase in this regime such that possible ordering signatures are weak and hard to identify within the pffrg .",
    "tracking the appearance of an instability feature during the rg flow , we find that the phase boundary between the @xmath2 and the non - magnetic phase is approximately given by the line between @xmath205 and @xmath206 which goes almost through the values predicted by dft calculations and esr measurements for _ herbertsmithite_. on the paramagnetic side of the transition , the dominant spin correlations are found to be either of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or _",
    "incommensurate _ type ( i.e. , at a position between @xmath2 and @xmath3 wave vectors in @xmath32 space ) . on the other hand , the magnetic phase is completely dominated by @xmath2 order . as an example , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : herbertsus ] ( b ) the @xmath58 flow and the susceptibility profile for @xmath207 .",
    "interestingly , the latter exactly shows the type of fluctuations measured in recent neutron - scattering experiments , i.e. , a large response at the brillouin - zone boundary and small maxima at the @xmath2 wave vectors .",
    "however , the rg flow also shows small signatures of an instability for these parameters which would possibly correspond to weak magnetic order , in contradiction with experiments .",
    "while it is difficult to draw any definite conclusion from these features , we note that such anomalies typically become more pronounced for larger system sizes and a better frequency resolution .",
    "we therefore propose the following two scenarios for _ herbertsmithite _ : ( i ) the dm interaction might be smaller than the predicted value , i.e. , @xmath208 . assuming that the heisenberg interactions are approximately given by @xmath209 , this would stabilize a non - magnetic phase according to our pffrg data",
    "nevertheless , in these parameter regimes , pffrg suggests that the dominant spin correlations are of @xmath3 type rather than @xmath2 which requires an additional coupling mechanism shifting the peaks .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath210 describes the couplings of _ herbertsmithite _ , we find the qualitatively correct momentum profile of the spin correlations .",
    "possible weak @xmath2 order at these parameters could be destroyed by further frustrating interactions .",
    "indeed , dft simulations predict various types of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interlayer couplings up to @xmath211  @xcite which could easily enhance the in - plane frustration effects .",
    "furthermore , magnetic disorder due to copper ions on zinc sites could also be a source of quantum fluctuations in the system .",
    "in this work , we have generalized the existing pffrg approach to treat spin models with finite dm interactions . after discussing the central methodological adjustments due to off - diagonal exchanges , we tested the method for nearest - neighbor out - of - plane dm and antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor heisenberg interactions on the kagome lattice .",
    "we find that , at @xmath212 , the dm coupling destabilizes the non - magnetic phase and induces @xmath2 order , in good agreement with exact diagonalization  @xcite . in sec.[sec : nextnearestneighbor ] , we have further analyzed the interplay of dm interactions with first and second - neighbor heisenberg couplings .",
    "the phase diagram of the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath12 model ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediagrams ] ) shows that , upon increasing @xmath12 , all non - collinearly ordered phases ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and cuboc orders ) are enlarged while the non - magnetic phases shrink . for strong enough dm couplings ( @xmath213 ) , the non - magnetic phase around @xmath33 is found to vanish completely .",
    "parameter regimes that have been reported to describe the mineral _ herbertsmithite _ are found to lie in close proximity to a quantum critical point between a non - magnetic phase and a @xmath2 ordered phase .",
    "at least in parts of this parameter region , we qualitatively reproduce the low - energy neutron - scattering data from ref .  .",
    "despite this , the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath12 model possibly misses additional sources of frustration that might be necessary to destroy weak residual magnetic order .",
    "we argue that interlayer exchange couplings could provide such additional frustration effects .    in total",
    ", this study shows that the pffrg approach can be successfully applied to models with finite dm couplings .",
    "since such interactions are a consequence of lattice geometries and therefore represent a relevant perturbation in a large class of quantum magnets , we expect plenty of possibilities for future applications .",
