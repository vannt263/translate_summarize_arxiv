    "the structure of topological charge in the qcd vacuum is central to an understanding of low - energy hadron dynamics .",
    "lattice calculations have provided quantitative confirmation of the witten - veneziano @xcite relation between the topological susceptibility of quenched qcd and the mass of the @xmath12 meson @xcite .",
    "the success of the witten - veneziano relation , which relates the topological susceptibility to the chiral structure of the quenched @xmath12 correlator @xcite is most easily understood in the context of the large @xmath9 approximation .",
    "( in this case , the large @xmath9 approximation provides a justification for resumming quenched `` hairpin '' insertions . ) the observation of extended , coherent , codimension 1 sheets of topological charge in monte carlo generated su(3 ) gauge configurations @xcite points to a new paradigm for the qcd vacuum .",
    "contrary to the standard instanton liquid picture , the vacuum is apparently a `` topological sandwich '' consisting of alternating sign membranes of topological charge .",
    "longstanding arguments of witten @xcite based on large - n chiral dynamics show that , for sufficiently large n , instantons should disappear from the qcd vacuum and be replaced by codimension-1 membranes which are in fact domain walls between discrete `` k - vacua , '' where the effective local value of @xmath0 differs from that of the true ground state by @xmath13 , with @xmath14 an integer .",
    "the topological sandwich picture which has emerged from the monte carlo calculations is quite compatible with these large n arguments .",
    "this picture is in some ways a 4-dimensional analog of coleman s picture of @xmath0-dependence in the massive schwinger model @xcite . in that model",
    "there are no instantons , and @xmath0 can be interpreted as a background electric field .",
    "the domain walls are just charged particles , whose world lines have codimension 1 . these world lines separate regions in which the electric flux differs by one unit",
    ", i.e. @xmath15 . a similar interpretation of @xmath0-dependence applies to the two - dimensional @xmath16 sigma models , which also have a u(1 ) gauge invariance .",
    "luscher @xcite clarified the analogy between 2d @xmath17 theories and 4d yang - mills theory by pointing out the similar role played by the chern - simons tensors in the 2d and 4d theories .",
    "the wilson loop in the @xmath16 model is analogous to a `` wilson bag '' in qcd , which is an integral of the cs tensor of the yang - mills field over a three - dimensional surface . from this viewpoint",
    "the wilson loop @xmath18 in 2d should be interpreted as a one - dimensional surface integral of the chern - simons flux @xmath19 .",
    "monte carlo studies of the @xmath16 models @xcite have shown that for @xmath20 these models exhibit a topological structure quite analogous to that observed in lattice qcd , with the vacuum occupied by extended coherent topological charge structures of codimension 1 @xcite . in striking contrast , the topological charge distributions in the @xmath2 and @xmath21 models are found to be dominated by small instantons @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 models thus provide a detailed example of witten s arguments that instantons should `` melt '' or become irrelevant at large @xmath9 . for the @xmath16 models ,",
    "the instanton melting point is found to be about @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "( as discussed in @xcite , the value of @xmath9 at which instantons become irrelevant may depend on the lattice formulation , but for any latticization , at least the @xmath2 model is expected to be dominated by small instantons . )",
    "although the value of the @xmath0 parameter in real - world qcd is zero to high accuracy , a deeper understanding of topological charge structure can by obtained by considering gauge theories with nonzero @xmath0 terms .",
    "unfortunately , monte carlo studies of qcd at nonzero @xmath0 are severely hampered by the fact that the @xmath0 term contributes an imaginary part to the eucidean action . as a result",
    ", the exponentiated action in the path integral can not be interpreted as a probablility , precluding the direct simulation of such theories by monte carlo techniques .",
    "naive reweighting methods , in which the @xmath23 factor in the path integral is introduced in the ensemble average over @xmath24 configurations , are sufficient for probing small values of @xmath0 . but some of the most interesting issues associated with multi - phase structure are most directly addressed by studying the region @xmath6 , where reweighting methods are ineffective .",
    "more sophisticated techniques for extending the reach of monte carlo techniques to large @xmath0 have been introduced @xcite , but definitive results near @xmath6 are still difficult to obtain by these methods .    in this paper",
    "we present a method for exploring @xmath0-dependence in two - dimensional @xmath17 gauge theories which is based on the calculation of fractionally charged wilson loops in the @xmath24 theory .",
    "the results for the free energy density @xmath25 in the @xmath16 models exhibit the power of this method , providing direct numerical evidence for a first order phase transition at @xmath26 for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 models .",
    "in clear contrast with the larger @xmath9 models , the instanton dominated @xmath2 model exhibits smooth behavior in the @xmath26 region , as expected from a dilute instanton gas calculation .",
    "( our results do not rule out a second order phase transition at @xmath26 in the @xmath2 model , which is expected from theoretical arguments @xcite ) .",
    "the central observation which we exploit here is that , in the path integral for a 2d u(1 ) gauge theory , including a closed wilson loop with charge @xmath5 is equivalent to including a @xmath0 term in the two - volume enclosed by the loop .",
    "the wilson loop goes around the boundary @xmath27 of a two - volume @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the topological charge density .",
    "since the @xmath16 models have nonzero topological susceptibility , the free energy per unit volume @xmath1 inside the loop is greater than @xmath31 outside .",
    "this gives rise to a linear confining potential between fractional charges or equivalently , an area law for large wilson loops .",

    "note that since @xmath34 , the coefficient of the area law is periodic in the charge @xmath35 . at integer values of charge ,",
    "the confining force is completely screened and the area term in the wilson loop vanishes .",
    "the behavior observed in the region @xmath36 distinguishes between an instanton - dominated model and a large @xmath9 domain wall model .",
    "for an instanton theory , a dilute gas approximation gives @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the topological susceptibility . on the other hand ,",
    "large n considerations @xcite predict quadratic behavior , with periodicity leading to cusps at odd multiples of @xmath39 , @xmath40 physically , these cusps represent `` string - breaking '' or vacuum screening , which occurs when it is energetically favorable to screen the background electric flux by one unit from @xmath41 to @xmath42 . for large loops ,",

    "note that for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath38 scales properly as @xmath55 , while for @xmath2 the small instantons cause @xmath56 to diverge in the continuum limit . ]",
    "the calculations were done on both @xmath57 and @xmath58 lattices and the effect of finite volume was found to be negligible .",
    "the results plotted in figure 1 indicate that by studying these three models , we cover the entire range of topological charge dynamics from @xmath2 which is instanton - dominated , to @xmath4 where bulk topological properties are described with reasonable accuracy by the large n approximation .",

    "one of the most striking features of the monte carlo results for fractionally charged wilson loops is the difference between the behavior in @xmath2 versus that in @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the region @xmath62 .",
    "since @xmath1 is periodic and an even function of @xmath0 , its value in this region should be determined by its value in the range @xmath11 by reflection around @xmath39 , @xmath63 as seen in figure 2 , the measured value of @xmath1 for @xmath2 ( @xmath46 s ) is , within errors , nicely periodic and symmetric around @xmath26 , and in fact fits well to the dilute instanton gas prediction ( [ eq : instanton_gas ] ) throughout the range @xmath7 . on the other hand , for @xmath3 ( @xmath59 s ) and @xmath4 ( o s ) , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the coefficient extracted from a simple area - law fit to the wilson loops continues to rise beyond @xmath26 , violating the expected symmetry ( [ eq : reflection ] ) .",
    "we will argue that the behavior of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath64 is an effect of having two nearly degenerate ground states .",
    "this behavior can be easily understood in terms of the large n picture@xcite , in which there are two nearly degenerate quasi - vacua when @xmath6 .",
    "one vacuum has a background electric field @xmath65 .",
    "the other is the one in which a unit of flux has been screened , so that @xmath66 . a wilson loop with length @xmath67 in the spatial direction and @xmath68 in the time direction",
    "can be interpreted as the @xmath68-dependent propagator of a `` string '' of length @xmath67 , consisting of a @xmath69 and a @xmath70 charge with an amount @xmath5 of electric flux between them .",
    "this state has a large overlap with the vacuum state containing background flux of @xmath71 .",
    "but for @xmath64 , the true ground state is the one where the flux has been screened by one unit to @xmath72 .",
    "in order for the wilson line to couple to this screened vacuum , the flux string must break via vacuum polarization .",
    "it is thus expected that , for @xmath64 , the wilson line will have a much larger overlap with the false ( unscreened ) vacuum than with the true ( screened ) vacuum . as a result , the wilson loop area law tends to be determined by the energy of the unscreened vacuum , even for @xmath64 where the screened vacuum has lower energy . since the wilson line couples preferentially to the unscreened vacuum",
    ", we expect that our results for @xmath1 are measuring the true ground state energy throughout the range @xmath73 , where the unscreened vacuum is the true vacuum . by invoking the reflection symmetry ( [ eq : reflection ] )",

    "the solid and dotted curves are again the instanton gas and large @xmath9 predictions with normalization fixed to the measured @xmath38 .",
    "unlike the @xmath2 case , the data for @xmath3 and @xmath4 shows a clear departure from the instanton gas model in the direction of large n. in particular , there is convincing evidence that @xmath1 has a positive slope at @xmath26 , and since @xmath76 , this implies a cusp with discontinuous derivative at @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , the results for @xmath77 for the @xmath4 model ( fig .",

    "the topological charge density is proportional to the electric field strength , @xmath94 the simplest definition of the local topological charge density on the lattice is thus obtained from the plaquette phase , @xmath95 in recent studies of topological charge structure in the @xmath16 models@xcite ( as well as in qcd @xcite ) , it was found that a `` fermionic '' construction of the lattice topological charge density based on the overlap dirac operator provides a much clearer view of coherent structures ( both domain walls and instantons ) .",

    "the ability to obtain accurate results for the free energy as a function of @xmath0 over the whole range @xmath11 opens new possibilities for the monte carlo exploration of topological phase structure in two - dimensional gauge theories .",

    "it is interesting to consider the calculation of @xmath1 in the dilute instanton gas approximation ( [ eq : instanton_gas ] ) and compare it with the assumptions that lead to the large n prediction ( [ eq : largen ] ) .",
    "we write the euclidean path integral with periodic boundary conditions as a sum over `` winding number '' ( global topological charge ) sectors , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the path integral over configurations with total topological charge @xmath100 . for a dilute instanton gas , this is given as a sum over instantons and antiinstantons , @xmath120 here @xmath121 is the partition function for a single instanton or antiinstanton in a box of volume @xmath28 .",

    "the fact that a pure gaussian distribution in @xmath100 implies a first order transition at @xmath26 has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the results presented here demonstrate the utility of fractionally charged wilson loops as a probe of topological structure in @xmath17 gauge theories .",
    "applied to the 2d @xmath16 models , this method clarifies the nature of the transition from an instanton - dominated vacuum at small @xmath9 to a domain - wall - dominated vacuum at large @xmath9 .",
    "although in two dimensions both types of vacuum lead to confinement of fractional @xmath17 charge , the confinement mechanisms are quite different in the two cases .",
    "this distinction is of interest for investigating the relationship between topological charge and confinement in higher dimensional theories like @xmath133 . in two dimensions ,",
    "instantons give rise to electric charge confinement by introducing a phase incoherence in the fractionally charged loop arising from the varying number of instantons minus antiinstantons inside the loop , producing an area law falloff of the wilson loop . because the instanton topological charge is locally quantized , this phase incoherence automatically disappears for an integer charged loop .",
    "this is why the @xmath1 for the @xmath2 model returns to zero at @xmath112 and exhibits no `` false vacuum '' effect . because topological charge is not locally quantized in the large @xmath9 , domain wall dominated models , the amount of charge inside the loop is not restricted to be an integer",
    "this gives rise to phase incoherence and an apparently nonvanishing area law coefficient , even for integer charged loops .",
    "as is well - known , the instanton confinement mechanism does not extend to higher dimensions .",
