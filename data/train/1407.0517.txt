    "this paper is based on the dissertation @xcite , which contains many additional details of numerical , analytical , and statistical computations of the models discussed below .",
    "a pension plan is a method for a prospective retiree to transfer part of his or her current income stream toward a retirement income .",
    "pension plans are usually classified into two categories ,    1 .   a defined - benefit plan - the pension fund ( e.g. , employer ) guarantees the pensioner a fixed , predefined , benefits upon retirement , regardless of the investment s performance .",
    "2 .   a defined - contribution plan - the pension fund makes predefined contributions , usually tax exempt , toward a pool of funds , set aside for the pension fund s future benefit .",
    "the pool of funds is then invested on the retiree s behalf allowing her / him to receive benefits upon retirement . the final benefit received by",
    "the retiree depends on the investment s performance .",
    "the benefits are paid , usually in a lump sum , upon the pensioner s retirement . however , in some countries , such as the uk , members are legally required to purchase an annuity , which then provides a regular income .",
    "pensions have a long history in western civilization .",
    "the notion of pension dates back to the roman empire @xcite , where rulers and parliaments provided pensions for their workers , who helped perpetuate their regimes .",
    "more than two thousand years ago , the fall of the roman republic and the rise of the empire were inextricably linked to the payment , or rather the nonpayment , of military pensions .",
    "the first private pension was established in 1875 by the american express company in the united states @xcite . prior to 1870 , private - sector plans did not exist , primarily because most companies were small , family - run enterprises .",
    "a public pension fund is one that is regulated under public - sector law , while a private pension fund is regulated under private - sector law . in certain countries",
    "the distinction between public or government pension funds and private pension funds may be difficult to assess . in others ,",
    "the distinction is made sharply in the law , with very specific requirements for administration and investment .",
    "for example , local governmental bodies in the united states are subject to laws passed by the states , in which those localities exist and these laws include provisions , such as defining classes of permitted investments and a minimum municipal obligation @xcite .      the obligation of a fixed",
    ", predefined amount of benefits upon retirement exposes the insurer to a great risk .",
    "the calculation of the the benefits amount is based on financial assumptions that are hard to measure or predict .",
    "these assumptions include the lifespan of employees , returns earned by pension investments , future taxes , and rare events , such as natural disasters .",
    "on the other hand , defined - contribution plans transfer the risk to the insured , who is dependent on the pension fund performance upon his / her retirement date .",
    "an individual that has retired in 2009 received significantly less than he / she would have in 2011 .",
    "the following data paint a grim picture of uk and us pension plans .    in the us",
    ", there was a $ 1 trillion gap at the end of the fiscal year 2008 between the $ 2.35 trillion that american states had to set aside to pay for their employees retirement benefits and the $ 3.35 trillion price tag of those promises @xcite .",
    "the present value of unfunded obligations under social security as of august 2010 was approximately $ 5.4 trillion @xcite .",
    "moreover , american state and local pension plans exhibit a structural shortfall that will likely pose a long - enduring problem , according to the us congressional budge office @xcite . in the uk ,",
    "many employees face retirement with an income well short of their expectations .",
    "employees who pay into a defined - contribution plan for 40 years , may get only half of the retirement income they could have expected @xcite . according to the international monetary fund @xcite , western economies would have to set aside an additional 50% of their 2010 gdp to support the retirees .",
    "several reforms have been suggested to amend the pension crisis .",
    "reform proposals can be classified into three .    1 .   to meet pre - existing defined benefit obligations , the retirement age should be raised .",
    "2 .   to mitigate risk and reduce obligations , there should be a shift from defined - benefit to defined - contribution pension plans .",
    "3 .   to improve accumulated wealth , there should be an increase in resource allocation to fund pensions by increasing contribution rates and taxes .",
    "the first reform does not exhibit any structural solution , but rather tries to put out a fire .",
    "the second reform still contains the risks of defined - contribution plans , and the third reform involves raising taxes , which potentially reduces the reward of work and therefore of the incentive to work .",
    "setting up super trusts is based on the belief that its investment policies achieve low - volatility , low - risk , and steady growth .",
    "these policies include 100% stake purchases in companies that produce basic products or commodities , with an underlying economic substance and a high , stable demand .",
    "the super trusts refrain from investments that carry no fundamental value .",
    "investments that are considered risky by the super trusts are stocks , bonds , currencies , arbitrage - trading , futures , options , and all forms of derivatives .",
    "the motivation for this approach is based on a long list of historical financial crises . to name but a few :    1 .",
    "black monday ( 1987 ) - dow jones industrial average dropped 22.61% in one day @xcite .",
    "2 .   saving and loans ( 1980 s , 1990 s ) - nearly 25% of all saving and loans associations in the united states , worth $ 402 billion , failed @xcite . the estimated crisis cost in 1996 alone , was $ 160 billion in 1996 , with a total cost of $ 370 billion , 92% taken from tax payers .",
    "3 .   russian financial crisis ( 1998 ) - several factors , such as artificially high fixed exchange rate and chronic fiscal deficit led the russian government to devalue the ruble , default on domestic debt , and decalre a moratorium on payment to foreign creditors @xcite . as a result ,",
    "inflation reached 84% that year .",
    "banks closed down .",
    "millions of people lost their life savings .",
    "as a direct consequence , us hedge funds collapsed , including long term capital management ( ltcm ) , which received a $ 3.6b bailout @xcite , under the supervision of the federal reserve .",
    "4 .   the dot - com bubble ( 2000 ) -",
    "the nasdaq composite lost 78% of its value .",
    "$ 5 trillion loss in the market value of companies .",
    "5 .   the subprime mortgage crisis ( 2008 ) - americans lost more than a quarter of their net worth .",
    "housing prices dropped , gdp began contracting , unemployment rate rose from 5% to 10% .",
    "s&p500 fell 57% from its october 2007 peak .",
    "us total national debt rose form 66% gdp pre - crisis to over 103% post - crisis @xcite .",
    "in addition , the rise of algorithmic trading , systematic trading , high frequency trading , and hedge funds gave birth to new type of stock market crashes - computer code crashes .",
    "for example , the 2010 flash crash @xcite , and the knight capital group crash @xcite in 2012 , are results of crashing of computers running complex algorithms .",
    "these crises led the super trusts to seek growth in the net income instead of stock market returns .",
    "for the purpose of pension - fund modeling we adopt the s&p500 index methodology @xcite as a representative strategy of a pension fund investment policy . specifically , the s&p500 eligibility criteria are    1 .   market value of more than $ 4.6b .",
    "2 .   annual dollar value traded is greater than its market value in the 6-months period prior to inclusion .",
    "at least 250,000 of its shares are traded each month in the 6-months period prior to inclusion .",
    "4 .   it is a us company .",
    "at least 50% of the company s shares are offered to the public 6 .",
    "at least 4 consecutive quarters of positive earnings prior to inclusion . 7 .",
    "hasnt been initially offered to the public ( ipo ) for the past 6 - 12 months .",
    "a company is excluded from the fund if one of the following holds .    1 .",
    "it is involved in a merger or acquisition ( m&a ) that causes at least 1 violation of the above eligibility criteria .",
    "the company is violating at least 1 of the above eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis .",
    "this investment methodology is aligned with purpose of the pension fund , because companies that meet the above requirements are profitable by definition : they exhibit 4 consecutive quarters of positive earnings and moreover , do not exhibit negative earnings on an ongoing basis .",
    "furthermore , these companies are highly liquid and are worth more than $ 4.6b . in addition , the historical fact that 97% of removals from s&p500 are due to m&as and that the average time a company stays in the index is 16.7 years , strengthens the notion that these companies are generally profitable and stable .",
    "consequently , these characteristics qualify them as companies with substantial economic substance , suitable for investments by a pension fund .",
    "the pension funds are the beneficiaries of the companies net profit and it is up to the management s discretion to determine the amount of the net profit retained by its underlying companies and the amount accumulated into the pension fund . in order to be able to gauge fund s performance , we assume that none of the portfolio s net profits is retained by the underlying companies and that the fund accumulates the entire portfolio s net earnings . therefore , the growth of the fund net income , at time @xmath0 , relative to initial time @xmath1 , is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the net income of the @xmath4-th company in s&p500 at time @xmath0 and @xmath5 is the time it was first included in the index .",
    "fama s efficient - market hypothesis ( emh ) was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis states that it is impossible to `` beat the market , '' because stock market efficiency causes existing share prices to always incorporate and reflect all relevant information .",
    "according to the emh , stocks always trade at their fair value on stock exchanges , making it impossible for investors to either purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the collective price of a market as a whole , as represented by s&p , for example , should incorporate and reflect all information about its constituents , including their earnings performance at the time of their publication .",
    "we assert this argument by comparing historical returns of two s&p indices against their shifted approximated by adding 3 months to the quarter of which the financial statements refer to . for example , if a company reported net income for the 2nd quarter , we assign september 30th as the publication date .",
    "the period of 3 months shift was chosen , because us companies are required by law to publish their quarterly financial reports by the end of the subsequent quarter .",
    "we obtain financial statements and price data from the crsp / compustat merged database @xcite and plot the historical monthly performance of their shifted cpi - adjusted net income growth , @xmath6 , from 1970 through 2011 .",
    "we also plot a 0.6% window moving average to highlight their trend . to emphasize the high correlation of their dynamics , we plot cpi - adjusted returns performance against the shifted trend of the net earnings curve .",
    "the chosen indices representing the market are s&p50 and s&p500 ( see figures [ fig : sp500 ] , [ fig : sp50 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between the shifted earning ( raw , not smoothed ) and the return performance .",
    "the pearson coefficient is given by @xmath7}{\\sigma_x \\sigma_y}.\\ ] ] the results seem to belie the widely held belief that investment in the stock market is similar to gambling in a casino , while purchasing companies is safe .",
    "we conclude that the stock market index faithfully reflects the companies profits at the time of their publication , thus strengthening the efficient market hypothesis .",
    "moreover , based on analysis of historical data , stock prices perform better , while being just as safe .    in view of the above , we refine the suggested investment strategy to purchase the shares of s&p500 companies instead of a 100% stake in them .",
    "our model of a defined - contribution plan includes an augmented initial influx , invested in the s&p500 stock market index .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we developed here a stochastic model of the random environment of a pension plan that is invested in the stock market .",
    "the model is based on historical stock market data .",
    "data analysis confirms the emh which implies that there is no benefit in the pension fund setting up a super fund that owns `` good '' companies lock stock and barrel .",
    "we find that cpi - adjusted salaries decrease over time , while cpi - adjusted market returns drift upwards . assuming that past market dynamics persists in the future , our model estimates that the pensioner is likely to accumulate @xmath8 times his initial annual salary over 40 years of pension savings .",
    "assuming 10% salary contribution , this means that the pension portfolio cpi - adjusted average annual return is 2.85% .",
    "we find that there is only @xmath9 chance for this pension to be sufficient , assuming retirement age at 67 .",
    "in other words , a salaried employee , who worked his entire life without receiving any substantial promotions , bonuses or extra incomes , has about 80% chance to live his last 10 - 15 years in poverty . raising the retirement age to 72",
    "is expected to bring these chances down to about 70% .",
    "these results shed further light on the imminence and significance of the pension poverty problem .",
    "it is not clear from the model and its analysis what is an investment strategy that the tax payer can adopt to insure pensions .",
    "clearly , owning companies on a national scale might form a centrally planned economy , in which the government owns a portion of the means of production .",
    "this could lead to economic inefficiencies observed in socialized economies in the past . investing pension funds in the economy",
    "can be bolstered by the tax payer by expanding it through investments in infrastructure such as large scale public utilities , mainly in education and continuing education .",
    "tax money is funnelled into the private sector in the usa by government contracts for projects and services , but not necessarily into direct subsidies for investors or in the form of preferential tax breaks .",
    "the latter is a common practice in israel , though .    to conclude , there is an imminent urge for the structuring of a long - term investment scheme that secures the pensioner welfare , yet it is a complicated , large - scale problem .",
    "based on numerical results , a symptomatic treatment of the pension problem can be achieved by raising the retirement age and increasing contributions . however , in order to achieve a systematic solution , researchers from the entire scientific spectrum need to contribute to the effort .",
