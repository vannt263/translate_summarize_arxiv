    "large numbers of neutrons can be produced through spallation reactions induced by an intermediate energy ( around 1 gev ) proton accelerator on a heavy element target . with the progress in high intensity accelerators it is now possible to conceive spallation sources that could compete with high flux reactors .",
    "several spallation sources for solid state and material physics are under construction or study in the usa ( sns  @xcite ) , in europe ( sinq  @xcite , ess  @xcite ) and in japan ( nsp  @xcite ) .",
    "spallation neutrons can also be used in accelerator driven systems ( ads ) to drive sub - critical reactors , in which long - lived nuclear waste could be burnt  @xcite or energy produced  @xcite .",
    "all these systems have in common a spallation target made of a heavy , either solid ( w , pb ) or liquid ( hg , pb , pb - bi eutectic ) metal in a container ( generally steel ) which is separated from the vacuum of the accelerator by a thin window .",
    "a detailed engineering design of a spallation target needs a precise optimisation of its performances in terms of useful neutron production and a proper assessment of specific problems likely to occur in such systems , like induced radioactivity , radiation damage in target , window or structure materials , additional required shielding due to the presence of high energy neutrons , etc ... this can be done by using monte - carlo transport codes describing the interaction and transport of all the particles created in nuclear reactions occurring inside the system to be designed .",
    "generally , a high energy transport code ( often based on the hetc code from @xcite ) , in which elementary interactions are generated by nuclear physics models , is coupled below 20 mev to a neutron transport code like mcnp  @xcite that uses evaluated data files .",
    "although the spallation mechanism has been known for many years , the models used in such codes , intra - nuclear cascade followed by evaporation - fission , have never been really validated on experimental data and large discrepancies remain both between experimental data and model predictions and between different models .",
    "this was particurlarly obvious from the oecd / nea intercomparisons  @xcite of these codes , regarding neutron and residue production .",
    "this led to the conclusion that many improvements of the models are still needed but also that there was a lack of experimental data to make a good validation , especially above @xmath0 mev . among the needed data , the energy and angular distributions of spallation produced neutrons are essential for model probing : the high energy part of the spectrum allows the testing of the intra - nuclear cascade while the low energy part of the spectrum is sensitive to the excitation energy at the end of the intra - nuclear cascade stage and the evaporation model .",
    "they are also important to optimize the target geometry since secondary particles contribute to the propagation of the inter - nuclear cascade in a thick target and high energy neutrons are responsible for radiation damage in target and structural materials .    during the last years , a wide effort has been made in several laboratories to measure spallation data regarding neutron multiplicity distributions  @xcite , light charged particles  @xcite and heavy residues  @xcite in order to establish a base for the test and validation of the spallation physics models .",
    "we report in this paper on neutron production double - differential cross - sections , measured at the saturne synchrotron , induced by @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 gev protons impinging on different targets .",
    "the experimental setup , although already discussed in detail in  @xcite , is presented in section 1 while the results are displayed in section 2 .",
    "the aim was to measure at one energy ( 1.2 gev ) neutron spectra on nuclei representative of different parts of the periodic table of elements and at the same time corresponding to materials used in targets or structures of accelerator driven systems : al , fe , zr , w , pb and th . at the two other energies only fe and pb targets were studied .",
    "angular distributions covering @xmath4 to @xmath5 were obtained and allowed the determination of average neutron multiplicities per reaction above 2 mev .",
    "the pb data have already been published in a letter  @xcite but are again reported here for the sake of completeness .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the comparison of the data to different intra - nuclear cascade models .",
    "the slow extraction of the beam delivered by the saturne synchrotron did not allow conventional time - of - flight measurement using the hf signal of the accelerator .",
    "therefore , the time - of - flight had to be measured between the incident proton passing through a thin scintillator placed in the beam and the detected neutron .",
    "for the highest neutron velocities this method becomes highly imprecise due to the limited available flight path , and a measurement of the ( n , p ) charge exchange by a spectrometer technique was adopted .",
    "these two methods had previously been tested in a first experiment in which neutrons were measured at 0@xmath6 and have been respectively described in detail in two previous papers  @xcite .",
    "then , a new experimental area was designed to allow complete angular distribution measurements .",
    "the scheme of this experimental area is shown in fig .",
    "[ figairexpspa ] .",
    "the beam comes from the left , hits the studied target and is deflected to a beam stopper ( composed of lead and tungsten blocks ) by a dipole magnet . to ensure the detection of the neutrons emitted by the target and not those coming from the beam stop , a large shielding of heavy concrete",
    "was built around the target .",
    "because the most energetic neutrons are emitted in the forward direction this shielding is thicker between 0@xmath6 and 90@xmath6 ( 3.5 meters ) than at backward angles ( 2.5 meters ) .",
    "the shielding is pierced by 12 circular holes at 0@xmath6 and every 15@xmath6 from 10@xmath6 to 160@xmath6 .",
    "each channel is composed of two consecutive cylinders of respectively @xmath7 and @xmath8 in diameter with a length of respectively @xmath9 and @xmath10 at forward angles and @xmath11 and @xmath12 at backward angles .",
    "the solid angle is determined by the size of the neutron detectors , not the collimator .",
    "the two detection methods were used in dedicated runs due to the fact that they required different beam intensities : between @xmath13 and @xmath14 particles per second for the spectrometer ( because of the low neutron - to - proton charge exchange efficiency ) while the time - of - flight was limited to less than @xmath15 particles per second by the use of the in - beam scintillator .",
    "the spectrometer was not used at angles larger than 85@xmath6 since very high energy neutrons are expected only at forward angles .",
    "the saturne synchrotron was delivering continuous beam during spills of @xmath16 with a repetition frequency depending on the beam energy ( typically 1.5 seconds for 800  mev protons in this experiment ) .",
    "a classic time - of - flight measurement between the neutron detector and a hf signal of the accelerator was thus not possible .",
    "we just recall here the principle of the method and the modifications performed since the first experiment at @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the time - of - flight is measured between the incident proton , tagged by a thin plastic scintillator ( sc ) , and a neutron sensitive ne213 liquid scintillator ( see fig  [ fig : dispotof ] ) .",
    "the beam intensity is fixed at a maximum of 10@xmath18 particles per second so that individual incident protons could be counted by sc .",
    "the target - detector distance depends on the angle but is about 8.5  meters .",
    "up to ten angles can be explored simultaneously using neutron detectors composed of a cylindrical cell of ne213 liquid scintillator coupled to a photomultiplier .",
    "six of them are cells of the multi - detector demon  @xcite and the other four ( called dense ) are smaller detectors , optimized for low energy measurements .",
    "the latter detectors allow energy measurements with a reasonable precision from 2 to 14  mev , while the demon cells are used between 4 and 400  mev .",
    "the characteristics of the demon and dense detectors are given in table  [ table : pmcharacterstics ] .",
    ".neutron detector characteristics . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to show the consistency of the three different sets of detectors , figs .  [",
    "fig : fereche ] and [ fig : ferecle ] display details of the double - differential cross - sections obtained for a fe target at 1600 mev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fereche ] data obtained at 10 and 25@xmath6 with the demon detectors ( filled circles ) and the spectrometer ( squares ) are shown .",
    "it can be seen that in the overlap regions , i.e.between 200 and 400 mev , the data are compatible within the error bars .",
    "actually , 1600 mev corresponds to the worst case since , as mentioned above , the spectrometer unfolding procedure is approaching its limits of reliability .",
    "other examples of the good agreement between both methods regarding pb at 800 and 1200 mev were shown in  @xcite .",
    "in fact , for all the measurements , the data from the demon detector and spectrometer always agree within less than 15@xmath19 at 1600 mev and 10@xmath19 at lower energies . concerning the comparison of spectra obtained between 4 and 12 mev with the dense and demon detectors , measurements at the same angles",
    "were done only for pb at 1200 mev and also shown in @xcite . however , since below 15 mev neutrons mostly come from an evaporation process which is practically isotropic in the laboratory system , results obtained at near angles can be compared .",

    "@xcite and nakamoto et al",
    ".  @xcite using time - of - flight . in each case",
    "we compare the data at the closest possible angles , adding when appropriate results from demon and dense detectors at two different angles .",
    "actually , our 10 , 25 - 40 , 55 , 85 - 100 , 115 - 130 and 145 - 160@xmath6 data are displayed together with the previous ones at respectively 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 and 150@xmath6 .",
    "our pb measurements at 800 mev ( left ) fully agree with amian ones , as already noticed in  @xcite , while nakamoto cross - sections are systematically lower at low neutron energy and higher at energies between 10 and 100 mev . for fe ( center ) ,",
    "only data from  @xcite are available and we observe a slightly less good agreement between the two works .",
    "however , it should be stressed that contrary to @xcite our ( and ref  @xcite ) targets are not really thin and secondary reactions increase the number of low energy neutrons ( as discussed below ) .",
    "this effect is visible only below 4 mev and appears to be larger for a 3 cm thick fe target than for a 2 cm thick pb one , as shown by the simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbfe_ep ] .",
    "this could explain why we measure more neutrons than amian et al . at low energies in the case of iron . at 1600 mev for pb ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compaminak ] right ) , we have compared our data to ref  @xcite data obtained at 1500 mev .",
    "this is possible since , from our 1200 and 1600 mev measurements , we could infer that cross - sections should differ by less than 5% between 1500 and 1600 mev , apart from the high energy part of the spectra at very forward angles . as observed at 800 mev , we get higher cross - sections below 7 mev and lower ones at intermediate energies .",
    "since the thickness of the targets are the same in both cases , this can be understood only by differences in the neutron detector efficiency determination . as mentioned earlier , at intermediate energies ,",
    "our experimentally determined efficiency  @xcite is higher than the one calculated using the standard ksu code and thus we used a modified version . as far as we know , it was the standard version of ksu that was used to determine the detector efficiency in  @xcite .",
    "this could explain the discrepancy .",
    "at high energies , with the spectrometer , we obtain a much better energy resolution than in ref .",
    "@xcite ( because of their limited flight path ) that allows us to distinguish structures due to direct reactions at forward angles .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=215 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=215 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=215 ]    as already mentioned , the thickness of our targets induces some distortion in the double - differential spectra because of the slowing down of the incident proton and the probability that some of the energetic emitted particles may undergo secondary reactions .",
    "the first point was discussed in  @xcite and results in a slight shift and a broadening of the quasi - elastic and inelastic peaks at very forward angles .",
    "the second effect is expected to lead to a depopulation of the high and intermediate energy parts of the spectra and an increase of the number of low energy emitted neutrons .",
    "calculations using the lahet high - energy transport code system  @xcite ( using bertini as intra - nuclear cascade model and pre - equilibrium ) were performed for both a target with the actual geometry and an infinitely thin one in order to assess the order of magnitude of the effect . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbfe_ep ] , results are shown for pb and fe at 800 mev .",
    "it can be seen that the difference is very small for the 2 cm lead target , for which it is significant only between 2 and 3 mev , and a little larger for the 3 cm iron one . in the latter case ,",
    "the disappearance of intermediate energy neutrons is also perceptible .",
    "similar results are found with the other targets and at other energies , the effect being maximum for fe and w.         all the measured angular distributions are presented together with the model calculations in the next section .",
    "data have been taken at 0.8 , 1.2 and 1.6  gev on pb and fe targets and at 1.2  gev on th , pb , w , zr , fe and al targets at 0 , 10 , 25 , 55 , 85 , 130 and 160@xmath6 .",
    "spallation reactions are generally described by a two step mechanism : a first stage in which successive hard collisions between the incident particle and the individual nucleons of the target nucleus lead to the emission of a few fast nucleons , then , the decay of the excited remnant nucleus by emission of low energy particles or , sometimes for heavy nuclei , by fission . the first step is generally described by intra - nuclear cascade models while evaporation - fission models are used for the second one .",
    "some authors introduce a pre - equilibrium stage between intra - nuclear cascade and de - excitation . in high energy transport codes ,",
    "the most widely used intra - nuclear cascade model is the old bertini  @xcite one dating from 1963 .",
    "however , several other models are available , such as the isabel  @xcite and the cugnon  @xcite incl models , which have brought some improvements in the physics .",
    "the most widely used evaporation model in the domain of spallation reactions is the dresner model  @xcite , usually associated with the atchison  @xcite fission model .",
    "the high energy part of the neutron spectra enables one to directly probe the intra - nuclear cascade models .",
    "low energy neutrons , which are the majority of the neutrons produced in spallation reactions , are emitted during the evaporation process .",
    "however , their number mainly depends upon the intra - nuclear cascade stage since the cascade determines the initial excitation energy of the decaying hot residue and , therefore , the number of evaporated particles .",
    "actually , evaporation neutron spectra for a given excitation energy are not expected to depend very much on the evaporation - fission model contrary to light charged particle spectra or to residual nuclei production for which emission barriers and competition between the different decay modes are not so well established .",
    "this is why we have made comparisons with different intra - nuclear cascade models in order to test their validity and understand their differences , using always the same evaporation - fission model .",
    "all the calculations discussed in the following have been done with high energy transport codes in which the actual thickness and diameter have been taken into account . in order to have sufficient statistics , calculations were done for angular bins of 5 degrees ( except at 0 degrees where it is only 2.5 degrees ) .",
    "the incl model does not predict a correct total reaction cross - section mainly because the diffuseness of the nuclear surface is not taken into account .",
    "therefore , the incl calculations were renormalized to the total reaction cross - sections given by the bertini model which appear to be in very good agreement with experimental values from  @xcite .            in  @xcite , for lead , we presented calculations performed with the tierce  @xcite high - energy transport code system developed at bruyres - le - chtel ( which is very similar to lahet ) using either the bertini or the cugnon incl model with the same evaporation - fission model ( based on the dresner - atchison model ) .",
    "it was shown that , at the three measured energies , the bertini model was largely overpredicting the experimental data while incl was giving a rather good agreement .",
    "this was ascribed to the higher excitation energy , @xmath20 , obtained at the end of the cascade stage with the bertini calculation than with incl .",
    "this assumption can be verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbex ] where the @xmath20 distribution obtained with bertini ( solid line ) is shown to extend to much higher values than incl ( dashed - dotted line ) and gives also a higher average value ( 265 versus 213 mev ) .",
    "these calculations were performed for thin targets at 1 gev .",
    "the same observations were also made in @xcite and @xcite where a similar plot was shown for p+au reactions and incl was found to give the best agreement with the excitation energy deduced from the neutron multiplicity distributions .",
    "several reasons can explain the difference in @xmath20 between the two models : first , incl leads to the emission of more pions than bertini .",
    "however , the difference in average @xmath20 due to the energy carried away by the pions is only 30 mev .",
    "second , as mentioned in @xcite , the pauli blocking is treated in a different way . in bertini ,",
    "only collisions of nucleons with momentum larger than the fermi momentum are allowed while , in incl , the actual phase space occupation rate is taken into account .",
    "this leads to a less stringent condition , therefore more cascade particles can escape and make the energy remaining in the nucleus lower .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pauli ] where the @xmath20 distributions with a strict pauli blocking ( as in bertini ) and the standard one are shown .",
    "the decrease is obvious .    ,",
    "is scaled by a multiplicative factor of 10@xmath21.,title=\"fig:\",width=275 ] , is scaled by a multiplicative factor of 10@xmath21.,title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]    in the lahet code system  @xcite it is possible to add after the intra - nuclear cascade stage a pre - equilibrium  @xcite stage which is expected to reduce the excitation energy of the nucleus by emission of intermediate energy particles prior to the evaporation .",
    "besides , this is also the recommended option by the lahet authors  @xcite . also available",
    "is the isabel model which can be used only up to 1 gev . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbex ] , both models lead to excitation energy distributions close to the one found with incl .",
    "isabel is used with the partial pauli blocking ( recommended ) option , which , as in incl , is supposed to take into account the depletion of the phase space due to the emission of cascade particles . here , we show calculations performed with both models and the same dresner - atchison evaporation - fission at 800 mev for the pb and fe target . in the following , bertini plus pre - equilibrium will be referred to as bpq .",
    "[ fig : pbfe800 ] presents the calculated neutron spectra compared to the experimental data .",
    "it can be observed that , for pb , the bpq calculation reproduces very well the data , except at very forward angles and high neutron energies where the peak corresponding to the excitation of the @xmath22 resonance appears much too high .",
    "this is a deficiency of the bertini intra - nuclear cascade model , already pointed out in  @xcite as due to a bad parameterisation of the @xmath23 reaction angular distribution .",
    "the problem does not exist with isabel .",
    "both models correctly predict the low energy part of the spectra .",
    "this can be understood by the respective excitation energy distributions being similar in their extension to the one found with incl ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pbex ] ) .",
    "the high energy neutrons above 85@xmath6 are also well reproduced by both calculations but isabel underestimates cross - sections at backward angles in the intermediate energy region . for iron , isabel presents the same features as for lead while bpq now overpredicts low and intermediate energy neutron production at forward angles , indicating that the angular distribution of pre - equilibrium neutrons is probably too much forward - peaked .                    at 1200 mev ,",
    "the use of isabel in lahet being limited to 1 gev , we compare the data with only bpq and incl calculations in figs .",
    "[ fig : thpb1200 ] , [ fig : wzr1200 ] and  [ fig : feal1200 ] , for all the targets .",
    "we also performed calculations , which are not shown here , using bertini without pre - quilibrium .",
    "whatever the target , this model yields too many low energy neutrons , emphasizing that it leads to too high excitation energies . for th , pb and w , both bpq and incl models give a reasonable agreement with the data , although bpq tends to slightly overestimate the production of intermediate energies neutrons .",
    "as the target becomes lighter , this trend is amplified and bpq begins to also overpredict low energy cross - sections .",
    "this is an indication that the addition of a pre - equilibrium stage after intra - nuclear cascade to decrease the too large excitation energy found in bertini may not be the proper solution : in fact , it seems difficult to obtain the correct evaporation neutron production without overestimating intermediate energy cross - sections ( which are enhanced by pre - equilibrium ) .",
    "on the contrary , incl reproduces quite well the results for all the targets , proving that the model has a correct mass dependence . only for the light targets at very backward angles ,",
    "the high energy neutron production is underpredicted .    at 1600 mev ,",
    "[ fig : pbfe1600 ] displays the results for the pb and fe targets . for bpq",
    "the tendencies noticed at 1200 mev are growing worse : even for pb , the agreement is not very good between 10 and 40 mev . since the high energy part of the spectra is always rather well reproduced ( except at 0@xmath6 ) , this seems to point out a wrong dependence of the pre - equilibrium emission also with incident energy . here again , incl gives a satisfactory agreement with the data for both targets .    in summary , we can conclude that incl is able to globally reproduce the bulk of our data , with some slight discrepancies in the angular distributions . the bertini model followed by pre - equilibrium , although it is found to be an improvement compared to bertini alone , works well for pb at 800 mev but fails as the energy is increased and the target gets lighter .",

    "since we divide by the reaction cross - section , the multiplicities obtained are numbers of neutrons per primary reaction and therefore contain the effect of secondary reactions .",
    "the interpolation between angles was done assuming that the angular dependence of the cross - sections was the same as the one calculated by the tierce code .",
    "this was necessary in particular between 2 and 4 mev where we have only a few points from the dense detectors .",
    "the uncertainty on these interpolations was assessed by using different intra - nuclear cascade models in tierce and different interpolation procedures .",

    "the comparison of the experimental to calculated average neutron multiplicities confirms in a rather concise way what has been observed in the preceeding section . in all cases",
    ", incl agrees with the data within the error bar while bpq tends to overpredict 2 - 20 mev neutron multiplicities , i.e. evaporation neutron production , especially at 1200 and 1600 mev . for high energy neutrons ( above 20 mev ) the sensitivity to the models is less important .",
    "this is most likely because of compensating effects , bpq predicting more intermediate energy neutrons because of pre - equilibrium while incl spectra often extend to higher energies .",
    "however , a significant deviation from the experiment is found at the two highest energies for iron with bpq .",
    "neutron multiplicity distributions have been measured by the nessi collaboration  @xcite using the technique of a gadolinium loaded liquid scintillator tank .",
    "the efficiency of this type of detector is large for low energy neutrons and decreases rapidly above 20 mev .",
    "mean neutron multiplicities were obtained by nessi at 1200 mev on w and pb targets with the same thickness as ours .",
    "although the threshold of our detectors did not allow us to measure neutrons with energies lower than 2 mev , it is tempting to compare the two results . for pb at 1200 mev , the nessi collaboration measured for a 2 cm thick , 15 cm diameter target , 14.6 neutrons per reaction which after efficiency correction  @xcite amount to 20.3 . in @xcite it is indicated that the average multiplicities have not been corrected for the additional neutrons coming from secundary reactions in the liquid scintillator .",
    "this effect was however investigated and estimated to be 5% for the 2 cm thick pb target ( see fig.8 of @xcite ) .",
    "taking this correction into account , the nessi multiplicity is then 19.3 . in our case , we can estimate the total number of neutrons by adding the experimental values measured between 2 and 1200 mev to the [ 0 - 2 mev ] multiplicity given by the codes . if we take the average between incl and bpq values we find 16.9 neutrons per reaction .",
    "the error is estimated to be of the order of 15% taking into account the errors discussed above plus the extrapolation to low energies . while the thickness of the targets in both experiments is the same the diameter is somewhat larger in the nessi case .",
    "we performed a simulation with lahet to investigate this effect .",
    "it appeared that because of secondary reactions of particles emitted sidewards the number of neutrons is 5% larger than with a 3 cm diameter target .",
    "this means that for a 15 cm diameter target we would find 17.8 @xmath25 2.7 neutrons to be compared to 19.3 @xmath25 1.9 if we take an uncertainty of 10% for the nessi result .",
    "the same can be done for the 1 cm thick w target . in this case , the additional contribution due to the target diameter is 3% . therefore",
    ", we obtain 16.9 @xmath25 2.5 to be compared to 18.0 @xmath25 1.0 for nessi  @xcite after efficiency correction and if we assume , as in pb , 5% additional neutron from secundary reactions in the liquid scintillator . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nessi ] , we can conclude that our results are compatible with those from nessi within the error bars .    also shown in tables  [",
    "table : multi800 ] , [ table : multi1200 ] , [ table : multi1600 ] are the averaged kinetic energies carried away by the neutrons , extracted from the double - differential cross - sections multiplied by energy using the same procedure as for the multiplicities and compared with the calculations . for the 2 - 20 mev bin , conclusions similar to what was stated for multiplicities can be drawn , reflecting the fact that ex@xmath26 is governed by @xmath26 in so far as the same evaporation model is used in both calculations and thus gives an identical energy spectrum for the low energy neutrons .",
    "for the high energy bin , the compensating effect noticed for the multiplicities seems to be even stronger and , regarding our uncertainties , it is not possible to discriminate between the two models .",
    "it is interesting , nevertheless , to remark that these high energy neutrons carry out the major part ( from 80% for th to 98% for al ) of the emitted neutron energy and a large amount ( about 30% ) of the incident proton energy . in a thick target",

    "in this paper , we have displayed double - differential cross - sections measured on a wide set of targets and at different energies .",
    "this has allowed a comprehensive comparison with some of the high energy models commonly used in high energy transport codes for applications .",
    "in particular , we have compared different models describing the first stage of the reaction ( intranuclear cascade possibly followed by pre - equilibrium ) keeping the same model for the de - excitation process .",
    "as we had shown in a previous paper that the bertini intra - nuclear cascade was leading to too high excitation energies at the end of the first reaction stage , we have tried to use the option , available in lahet and recommended by its authors , of adding a pre - equilibium stage .",
    "this largely improves the predictions of the code .",
    "however , discrepancies tend to appear and grow larger as the energy is increased above 800 mev and as the target becomes lighter . the isabel model was also tried at 800 mev .",
    "it gave reasonable agreement with the lead data but less good one for iron .",
    "unfortunately , since the use of isabel is limited to 1 gev in lahet , it was not possible to test the energy dependence of this model . finally , we have shown that the use of the cugnon intranuclear cascade model , incl , implemented in the tierce code , is able to fairly reproduce the whole bulk of our results .",
    "however , it should be recalled that this model still suffers from serious deficiencies mostly due to the fact this it does not treat correctly the diffuseness of the nuclear surface .",
    "this was the reason why we had to renormalize the calculation to the correct total reaction cross - section .",
    "also , the sharp surface approximation makes it impossible to have a correct prediction of the most peripheral collisions : this was clearly seen , for instance , in the isotopic distributions of residual nuclei close to the projectile presented in ref .",
    "a new version of the cugnon model is in progress  @xcite which is expected to solve this problem .",
    "this work is partly supported by the hindas eu - project , contract fikw - ct-2000 - 00031 .",
    "we would like to thank o.bersillon for providing us with the tierce code and j.cugnon and c.volant with the incl code .",
    "we are also grateful to a.letourneau for fruitful discussions about the nessi results ."
