    "dark matter ( dm ) is one of the biggest puzzles in the modern astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "this unseen mass component is thought to dominate the mass density of virialized objects in the universe .",
    "it is determinant to explain the high orbital velocities of gas and stars in the outer regions of spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) and leaves its imprint at cosmological scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dm is elusive , if at all , interacting very weakly with visible matter and has not yet detected by any experiment .",
    "thus , alternative ways to solve the missing mass problem have been suggested , since it could be related to our poor understanding of gravity laws at the galactic and cluster scales .",
    "one of the alternatives to dm is the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) by @xcite , which proposed that the missing mass problem in galaxies could be resolved by a modification of newton s law in the extremely low - acceleration regime .",
    "thus , the newton s second law of dynamics becomes @xmath3 , where the acceleration @xmath4 is related to the newtonian one  by @xmath5 .",
    "here , 0  @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the hubble constant ) and @xmath8 is an arbitrary function , named _ interpolating function _",
    ", with the limiting behaviours @xmath9 and @xmath10 . it has been shown to reproduce the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies without the need of dm , and provides a natural explanation for the observed relation between galaxy rotation and luminosity @xcite or baryonic mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "only a few analyses have been carried out on etgs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have demonstrated that mond is consistent with the central dynamics of etgs if the initial mass function ( imf ) is non universal , suggesting that it is `` lighter '' for low - dispersion galaxies , and `` heavier '' for high velocity dispersions .",
    "this result is consistent with a plethora of independent studies using central dynamics ( or gravitational lensing ) with standard dm halo models or modelling spectral gravity - sensitive features ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    a completely different recipe to supersede the presence of dm in virialized structures has been proposed ( @xcite ) .",
    "this proposal moves from the idea that space - time and gravity are macroscopic concepts that arise from an underlying microscopic description in which these concepts have no meaning .",
    "we refer to this theory as emergent gravity ( eg ) and use the formalism in @xcite .",
    "this new theory is thought to lead to modifications of the emergent laws of gravity at scales set by the ` hubble acceleration scale ' @xmath11 .",
    "similarly to the mond model , the gravitational force emerging in the eg framework exceeds that of general relativity ( gr ) on galactic and cluster scales .",
    "moreover , this excess gravity can be modelled as a mass distribution of _ apparent _ dm , which is only determined by the baryonic mass distribution @xmath12 and @xmath7 .",
    "a bunch of papers have recently tested this new theory on different scales , using weak gravitational lensing signal ( @xcite ) , dynamics of dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way ( @xcite ) , x - ray galaxy clusters ( @xcite ) , the radial acceleration relation in spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) , galaxy rotation curves and solar system planets perihelia ( @xcite ) , finding contrasting results . and @xcite have highlighted some limits in the verlinde s eg theory . in this paper , we will test the eg predictions in the central regions of massive and local etgs from the spider survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "we fix the hubble constant and allow the only free parameter of the theory , i.e. , the stellar to vary , constraining the `` normalization '' of the imf .",
    "then , we compare the results with mond , dm haloes and with findings from gravity sensitive spectral features . the paper is organized as follows . in [ sec : data ] we introduce the the data sample , the eg theory and the other models we compare with , and the dynamical modelling procedure . in [ sec : results ] we will discuss the results of our dynamical analysis , and finally [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "we aim at testing the verlinde s theory using the central dynamics of local etgs .",
    "the spider survey provides the perfect dataset to achieve this objective , since it has demonstrated to be very useful in the study of the luminous and dm distribution in the galaxy cores ( @xcite ) .",
    "it consists of a sample of @xmath13 bright ( @xmath14 ) etgs , in the redshift range of @xmath15 to @xmath16 , with optical and nir photometry available ( @xmath17 bands ) from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr6 and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey - large area survey dr3   ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effective radius  and srsic index @xmath18 have been measured from @xmath4 through @xmath19 , using the software 2dphot ( @xcite ) .",
    "spider etgs have central velocity dispersions , , available from the sdss , measured in the circular aperture of the sdss fiber ( having radius @xmath20 arcsec ) .",
    "the median ratio of the sdss fibre to the k - band effective radius , @xmath21 , amounts to @xmath22 .",
    "etgs are defined as bulge - dominated systems , with passive spectra within the sdss fibres ( @xcite ) . for the present work ,",
    "we rely on a subsample of @xmath23 spider etgs , with better quality optical and nir structural parameters , selected as in @xcite . for each galaxy ,",
    "the stellar population - based mass - to - light ratio , @xmath24 , has been estimated by fitting @xcite stellar population models to the multi - band photometry , under the assumption of a chabrier imf ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "according to @xcite , there exists an extra gravitational effect , in addition to the classical gr contribution of @xmath25 to the potential .",
    "this excess in the gravity emerges due to a volume law contribution to the entropy , that is associated with the positive dark energy in our universe . in a universe without matter ,",
    "the total entropy of the dark energy would be maximal , as it would be homogeneously distributed over all available space . in our universe , on the other hand , any baryonic mass distribution @xmath25 reduces the entropy content of the universe .",
    "this removal of entropy due to matter produces an elastic response of the underlying microscopic system , which can be observed on galactic and supergalactic scales as an additional gravitational force .",
    "the difference with gr is that this excess gravity does not come from a real dm contribution .",
    "but , it can be described by an _",
    "apparent _ dm distribution @xmath26 .    a system with a static , spherically symmetric and isolated baryonic mass distribution is considered .",
    "the amount of apparent dm can be obtained by estimating the elastic energy associated with the entropy displacement caused by @xmath25 .",
    "this leads to the following relation : @xmath27 where we integrate over a sphere with radius @xmath28 and area @xmath29 .",
    "the strain @xmath30 caused by the entropy displacement is given by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the speed of light , @xmath33 the gravitational constant , and @xmath7 the hubble constant ( which we choose to be @xmath34 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath35 is the volume that would contain the amount of entropy that is removed by a mass @xmath36 inside a sphere of radius @xmath28 , if that volume were filled with the average entropy density of the universe : @xmath37 [ eq : fundamentalrelation ] deserves some attention , since due to the inequality , observations can only put a higher bound on the @xmath38 .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we assume that the largest principle strain @xmath39 takes its maximal value and the response of the medium is negligible outside the mass , in this way using the equality in [ eq : fundamentalrelation ] .",
    "thus , inserting the relations ( [ eq : strain ] ) and ( [ eq : removedvolume ] ) into ( [ eq : fundamentalrelation ] ) , and taking the derivative with respect to @xmath28 on both sides of the equation , one arrives at the following relation : @xmath40 this is the apparent dm formula , which translates a baryonic mass distribution into an apparent dm distribution .",
    "we do not have independent constraints on the cosmological structure of the universe , using eg , so we assume that it should predict an expansion history that agrees with the current cosmological estimates ( @xcite )",
    ".      we will also compare the eg results with the ones in a standard scenario , adopting some specific dm halo models and with mond expectations . in the newtonian framework",
    ", we adopt a two - component model ( light + dm ) , where the light profile is modelled with a constant  profile with  variable and for the dm distribution we assume some dm halo models , fixing their parameters according to viable recipes .",
    "while , as for the eg theory , for mond we just use a constant  profile , with free , for the light distribution .",
    "_ dm - based models_. following @xcite , we adopt the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nfw , hereafter ) profile , assuming the correlation between virial mass and concentration (  and , respectively ) from @xcite , as well as the @xmath41 correlation from @xcite .",
    "in order to explore the effect of a possible modification to the dm profile because of the interaction between gas and stars with dm , we also consider the case of an nfw with a baryon - induced adiabatic contraction ( ac - nfw , @xcite ) .",
    "we have also explored how these results depend on the assumed  relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we finally use the prototype of cored models , i.e. the @xcite profile .    _",
    "-based models_. a modified newtonian gravitational acceleration model , in the regime of low acceleration , according to the mond theory ( @xcite ) , is an alternative theory to reproduce galactic dynamics without dm . for the interpolating function we use two following expressions : a ) @xmath42 ( @xcite ) and b ) @xmath43 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a constant profile with a free  is adopted for the total mass distribution ( see @xcite for further details ) . to reduce the computation time , in this case",
    "we follow the same binning procedure used in @xcite .",
    "most of these results using these models have been presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results using mond with spider dataset are firstly presented here . in @xcite",
    "we tested mond using a different datasample , finding similar results .",
    "we derive the dynamical ( i.e. total ) mass distribution of etgs by solving spherical isotropic jeans equations , where a given model for the mass profile is fitted to  for spider . in a newtonian framework ,",
    "two - component mass models , describing stars and dm , are adopted .",
    "with mond , a model for stars is adopted and equations are modified to account for the change of the force law ( @xcite ) . in the case of eg , we assume that the jeans equations have the same form of the newtonian case , and we just replace the dm mass distribution with the ( [ eq : veg_mdm ] ) .",
    "we consider that there is no gas , i.e. @xmath44 . accounting for a gas component would reduce the derived .",
    "the stellar mass profile is modeled by a srsic law .",
    "the shape parameter @xmath18 and effective radius of the srsic laws are those obtained by fitting galaxy images in k - band ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : sample_spider ] ) .",
    "the total luminosity of the light distribution is converted into stellar mass by means of the stellar mass - to - light ratio , , which is a free fitting parameter .",
    "we neglect gradients in stellar populations ( @xcite ) and imf ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    for each galaxy and a given model ,",
    "one has one single fitting parameter , i.e. the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the  is constrained by solving the jeans equations to match the available velocity dispersion estimate .",
    "in [ fig : mass ] we plot the total mass profiles for the eg and our reference dm - based model ( i.e. the nfw+light ) .",
    "we use an example mock galaxy , setting the srsic parameters and stellar mass to realistic values , as described in the caption of the figure .",
    "the total mass from eg gravity is a factor @xmath45 larger than the total mass derived from our reference dm - based model .",
    "thus , to match the two profiles we would require  in eg smaller of a factor @xmath46 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , to better quantify the ability of eg to fit the data , we proceed now to discuss the results from the dynamical analysis .",
    "we discuss the mismatch parameter , defined as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the obtained by fitting colors with stellar population models having a chabrier imf . in [ fig : dimf ] we plot  as a function of effective velocity dispersion .",
    "we find that for the eg the  is positively correlated with , getting very low values at the lowest-  ( i.e. @xmath49 ) and the highest values ( i.e. @xmath50 ) in the galaxies with the highest ; on average @xmath51 .",
    "the gray shaded region shows the range of the results assuming a wide set of dm - based models .",
    "these results are bracketed by the burkert profile , producing at fixed  the largest , and the adiabatically contracted nfw model , which produces the smallest  and .",
    "the red line is the result for our reference nfw profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cyan region is bracketed by the results for the two mond interpolating functions adopted .",
    "eg presents trends which are similar to what can be found if dm halos or mond are adopted , confirming most of the results in the literature .",
    "the apparent dm mass in the eg theory is larger than the equivalent quantity for mond .",
    "consequently , eg will give smaller , systematically lower than the same quantities for standard dm - based models and mond ( of a factor @xmath52 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the  values from eg are consistent with chabrier - like imf only at the highest - values , where most of the literature points to bottom - heavier imfs . at low-",
    "the discrepancy with standard results is still more troubling , since while the standard dm - based or mond models give chabrier - like imfs , or at most `` slighty - lighter '' , eg predicts very low values of .",
    "this would imply `` ultra - light '' imf , which seem unreliable if compared with typical predictions from spectral synthesis .    in [ fig : dimf ]",
    "we also show the two best results from gravity - sensitive features determined from stacked spider spectra ( @xcite ) , assuming a two - slope imf and adopting ( a ) two ssp models with the same imf but different ages and metallicities ( solid orange line ) and ( b ) two ssp models with free ages and metallicities , including as further free parameters the abundances of calcium , sodium and titanium ( dashed orange line ) .",
    "the eg results are totally in disagreement with these estimates , which are independent from either dm or gravity arguments .",
    "a possible source of systematics in the eg results is the hypothesis of isotropic stellar orbits .",
    "thus , we have considered two extreme models corresponding to radially constant anisotropy @xmath53 in the jeans equations ( @xcite ) : a tangential anisotropy , @xmath54 and a radial anisotropy , @xmath55 , plotted in [ fig : dimf ] as long- and short - dashed black lines , respectively . for tangential ( radial ) anisotropy larger ( smaller )  by a factor @xmath56 ( @xmath57 )",
    "are found with respect to the fiducial isotropic case .",
    "therefore , also if strong tangential orbits in etgs are assumed , eg does not match the results found using dm or mond and from gravity - sensitive features .",
    "we have checked the effect of the ellipticity and restricted the analysis to spider objects with k - band axial ratio @xmath58 ( see gray solid line in [ fig : dimf ] ) , in order to limit to the roundest galaxies .",
    "the overall results are practically unchanged .",
    "similarly , we have also found a negligible impact if we limit to the field galaxies ( gray dashed line in [ fig : dimf ] ) .",
    "finally , our equations depend on the hubble constant , @xmath59 . for @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) ,",
    "the results are shown in [ fig : dimf ] as short- ( long-)dashed blue lines , smaller ( larger )  by a factor @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) are found with respect to the fiducial case .",
    "the results found using dm , mond or gravity - sensitive features can be recovered only if extremely high values of @xmath64 ( larger than @xmath61 ) would be adopted .",
    "we have tested the new proposed eg theory from @xcite using the central dynamics of a sample of local massive etgs .",
    "the totally different physical formalism of this new theory , if compared with more standard alternative theories , such as mond , has attracted the interest of the astrophysics community . after the paper of @xcite , which has formalized the theory for virialized objects , under the hypothesis of spherical symmetry and isolation , some recent papers have test it , finding a good agreement with observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or pointing out some discrepancies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "etgs represent the best test bench for eg theory , since they can be approximated by nearly spherical systems and can also be found in field environments .",
    "we demonstrate that eg theory fails in the central regions of etgs , which is consistent with what found in spiral galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . to match the central velocity dispersion in etgs ,",
    "we show that the stellar  need to be non universal and strongly varying from low- to -high , consistently with the literature ( see [ sec : results ] for details ) .",
    "but , eg presents two major issues .",
    "first , it produces a strong excess gravity ( translated in a high apparent dm ) , which reproduces the central dynamics of etgs , but with _ unrealistically low _ values for the  ( on average @xmath65 , and @xmath66 in the lowest-  systems ) .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with what found recently by @xcite and @xcite , who conclude that eg can be consistent with rotation velocity curves and the radial acceleration relation in spiral galaxies , only if we decrease the values of .",
    "second , we find a strong disagreement with the  derived from gravity - sensitive features in spider spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , _ the unrealistically low values found for and the discrepancy with the results from gravity - sensitive features seem to be an indication against the verlinde s eg in the centers of etgs_. only extremely high and unfeasible values of @xmath64 would solve this discrepancy . moreover , as indicated by the key formula derived by verlinde , i.e. @xmath67 , observations can only put a higher bound on the @xmath38 .",
    "following @xcite and the recent literature on the subject , we have assumed that @xmath68 takes its maximal value , a hypothesis which can be incorrect , affecting all the subsequent conclusions .",
    "in fact , if we consider the inequality in the verlinde s formula , then to a fixed amount of baryons will correspond a smaller @xmath38 .",
    "this means that , if we would assume that the strain is not maximal , e.g. @xmath69 times smaller , then the central dynamics in etgs will be reproduced with higher and more realistic , potentially solving the eg tension above .",
    "_ this is a strong constraint imposed by the etg dynamics , that might be taken into account in the further development of the theory . _",
