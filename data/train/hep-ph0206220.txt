    "in ultra - peripheral heavy ion collisions , heavy quarks can be produced in electromagnetic or hadronic interactions .",
    "electromagnetic production occurs through strong electromagnetic fields which can interact with a target nucleus in the opposing beam ( photoproduction ) or with the electromagnetic field of the opposing beam ( two - photon reactions ) and produce hadronic final states , including heavy quark pairs .",
    "hadroproduction of heavy quark pairs is also possible in grazing interactions . since photon emission is coherent over the entire nucleus and because the photon is colorless , the three channels can be distinguished by the presence of zero , one or two rapidity gaps in the events and by whether or not the nuclei dissociate .",

    "photonuclear interaction studies have included coulomb dissociation@xcite and coherent vector meson production@xcite .",

    "although the list of experimentally observed channels is currently short , as rhic gears up new results should come quickly and measurements of heavy quark production in ultra - peripheral collisions may not be too far off .",
    "we build on previous calculations of heavy quark photoproduction@xcite and two - photon production@xcite in heavy ion collisions . for the first time , we consider resolved photon processes .",
    "we use modern parton distribution functions along with up - to - date accelerator species and luminosities .",

    "we first compare our lo results with nlo calculations .",
    "we also describe the dependence of our results on the chosen quark mass and scale .    at any order",
    ", the partonic cross sections for all three processes studied may be expressed in terms of dimensionless scaling functions @xmath332 that depend only on the variable @xmath333 @xcite , @xmath334 where @xmath335 is the square of the partonic center of mass energy , @xmath53 is the heavy quark mass , and @xmath56 is the scale .",
    "the cross sections are expanded in powers of @xmath22 and @xmath227 .",
    "the exponents @xmath336 and @xmath329 depend on the initial process : @xmath337 , @xmath338 direct photoproduction ; @xmath339 , @xmath340 hadroproduction ; and @xmath341 , @xmath342 direct two - photon production .",
    "the summation over @xmath42 includes all corrections beyond lo which only involve powers of @xmath22 with @xmath343 corresponding to the born and @xmath344 to the nlo cross sections .",
    "it is only at nlo that the logarithms @xmath345 appear .",
    "two scales , for renormalization and factorization , appear in the calculation but they are generally assumed to be the same since this choice is used in fits of the parton densities .",
    "the total cross sections are obtained by convoluting the partonic cross sections with the parton distribution functions or photon fluxes .",
    "the scale @xmath56 enters the total cross section in the evaluation of @xmath22 and in the parton densities of the proton or photon ( for resolved processes ) .    for a fully consistent calculation of the partonic cross sections",
    ", @xmath22 should be evaluated to one loop when @xmath343 , two loops when @xmath346 .",
    "the strong coupling constant has been evaluated up to three loops , corresponding to @xmath347 . however , a consistent evaluation of the cross section , order - by - order in partonic cross section , parton distribution , and @xmath22 , is usually not done .",
    "one is usually interested only in the effect of the next - higher - order corrections to the total cross section and it is only possible to measure the change by leaving other inputs , such as the parton densities , the same at all orders .",
    "thus , theoretical ratios of the total nlo to lo cross sections , the @xmath348 factors , are typically independent of the observable @xcite .",
    "the hadroproduction @xmath348 factor is larger for ` light ' heavy quarks , low @xmath5 , and low @xmath8 . as the heavy quark mass increases",
    ", @xmath348 drops from @xmath349 for @xmath159 to @xmath350 for @xmath149 in this energy range . for direct photoproduction ,",
    "the @xmath348 factors are smaller .",
    "the calculated @xmath348 factors for direct photoproduction of bottom are @xmath351 for @xmath352 and 1265 gev respectively @xcite .",
    "the lo resolved photoproduction results , @xmath353 with @xmath340 , @xmath354 in eq .",
    "( [ scalingfunctions ] ) as at lo in hadroproduction , are typically used without nlo corrections in photoproduction so that the same order in @xmath22 is used for both direct and resolved photoproduction .",
    "thus the @xmath348 factor would only be constant with rapidity and transverse momentum for direct photoproduction , not for the sum in eq .",
    "( [ phottot ] ) . however , the resolved contribution is always rather small and should not significantly change the @xmath348 factor .",
    "the nlo @xmath328 corrections are smaller still , @xmath355 for @xmath159 and 1.24 for @xmath149 in direct @xmath176 , dropping to @xmath356 for @xmath159 and 1.21 for @xmath149 single - resolved production @xcite .",
    "the small @xmath348 factor for direct @xmath176 should perhaps not be a surprise since , in a sense , @xmath176 is the cleanest determination of the @xmath348 factor because there is no parton density , @xmath22 or scale dependence at lo .",
    "this @xmath348 factor , calculated with both the lo and nlo scaling functions convoluted with nlo parton densities and two - loop evaluations of @xmath22 , does not mesh with a full lo calculation using lo parton densities .",
    "the incompatibilities include the difference in @xmath22 evaluated at one and two loops . in the mrst",
    "lo densities , @xmath357 gev so that @xmath358 and @xmath359 .",
    "the hadronic lo cross sections calculated with the mrst ho distributions@xcite are @xmath360 @xmath311b at 200 gev , rising to 6.03 mb at 5.5 tev , compared with @xmath361 @xmath311b at 200 gev and 5.83 mb at 5.5 tev .",
    "the nlo evaluation is two times larger at rhic , but at the lhc , the results agree within 3% .",
    "the difference is mostly due to the higher one - loop @xmath22 .",
    "because of these variations , we do not apply any @xmath348 factors to our lo calculations .",
    "our calculations for all three processes use the same values of @xmath53 and @xmath56 .",
    "the values are chosen to agree with hadroproduction data at fixed target energies .",
    "photoproduction and two - photon data imply larger charm quark masses than used here .",
    "the typical charm mass used for those processes , @xmath362 gev , predict lower cross sections than those employing the quark masses obtained from hadroproduction .",
    "one can speculate as to why this is true .",
    "it may be that the incident quarks and gluons in hadroproduction interact with the virtual heavy quark at its current quark mass while the almost real photons interact with the constituent @xmath18 and @xmath17 quarks .",
    "the constituent quark mass is larger than the current quark mass and is thus more compatible with the photoproduction data . on the other hand , since @xmath363 for hadroproduction , unincorporated higher order corrections may explain the apparent need for different quark masses . near threshold , the @xmath149 cross section has been evaluated to next - to - next - to - leading order and next - to - next - to - leading logarithm ( nnlo - nnll ) .",
    "recent results from hera - b @xcite agree very well with the predicted @xmath364 nb nnlo - nnll cross section @xcite calculated with @xmath326 gev .",
    "the nlo evaluation at the same energy is a factor of two smaller , suggesting that nlo calculations require smaller bottom quark masses .",
    "however , the nnlo - nnll expansion is invalid far away from threshold so that the importance of further higher order corrections is difficult to quantify .",
    "figure  [ massdep ] shows the quark mass dependence of the total cross sections for all three processes .",
    "we plot @xmath365 where @xmath366 gev for charm and 4.75 gev for bottom .",
    "the scale used is @xmath367 and @xmath368 for charm and bottom , respectively .",
    "results are shown for @xmath369 gev si+si collisions at rhic and 5.5 tev pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "the mass sensitivity is smaller at higher energies , as expected . for a given energy , hadroproduction is the least mass dependent .",
    "the direct photoproduction and two - photon production processes have nearly the same mass dependence . resolved production has a stronger mass dependence , especially at rhic . the mass dependence is stronger for charm than bottom , mainly because the charm mass is varied by 50% , from 1.2 to 1.8 gev while the bottom mass is only varied 18% , from 4.25 to 5.00 gev .",
    "the photoproduction and two - photon cross sections are more mass dependent than hadroproduction at the same energies .",
    "the maximum @xmath163 collision energies , @xmath148 , are a factor of @xmath370 less than @xmath25 in @xmath3 collisions at both colliders .",
    "the maximum photon energy fraction , @xmath371 , is @xmath372 for gold or lead , rising to 0.1 for silicon , much smaller than the maximum parton energy fraction , @xmath373 .",
    "this energy deficit is difficult to overcome and is only compensated for by the photon flux factor of @xmath155 in charm production with the heaviest ions .",
    "the energy difference is more important for bottom production , especially at rhic since @xmath148 is close to the @xmath149 threshold .",
    "as table  [ lum ] shows , lighter ions may be advantageous for photoproduction studies since the higher photon energies and accelerator luminosities can compensate for the smaller cross sections .",
    "the energy deficit in @xmath176 production is even larger , @xmath374 between the maximum @xmath259 and @xmath25 . for the heaviest ions at rhic",
    ", the maximum @xmath259 is below the @xmath149 threshold . in these collisions , even charm is not far from threshold .",
    "the factor of @xmath251 can not compensate for such an energy deficit .",
    "the 1 mb @xmath236 cross section for @xmath375 at lhc is still a factor of 1000 lower than those of the other processes .",
    "thus good experimental separation is essential for observing clean @xmath176 interactions .",
    "the photo- and hadroproduction scale dependence is small .",
    "the cross sections only change a few percent between @xmath376 and @xmath301 because increasing the scale decreases @xmath22 but increases the gluon density @xmath377 and vice versa .",
    "the two effects largely cancel . at nlo ,",
    "the scale dependence is usually larger for charm and bottom quarks than at lo @xcite because @xmath22 multiplies the logarithm @xmath378 .",
    "the scale dependence only enters through the resolved contributions in @xmath176 production where the effect is a factor of @xmath379 on single - resolved production and @xmath380 on double - resolved production .",
    "however , the total cross section is essentially unaffected because the direct contribution is independent of scale .",
    "to study ultra - peripheral heavy quark production , it is necessary to be able to disentangle the three channels .",
    "photoproduction , hadroproduction , and two - photon interactions may be separated on the basis of overall event characteristics .",
    "the signatures that can be used to distinguish between production processes are whether there are rapidity gaps in the event and whether the nuclei break up .",
    "nuclear breakup can be measured with downstream zdcs .",
    "other variables may be helpful in separating event classes .",
    "the event multiplicity is lower for photoproduction and two - photon interactions because less energy is available .",
    "the multiplicity also depends on the details of the interaction . for two - photon interactions ,",
    "the total event @xmath5 should be less than @xmath381 .",
    "unfortunately , it is necessary to reconstruct the entire event to measure the total @xmath5 .",
    "this is difficult in @xmath2 events .",
    "because of these difficulties , multiplicity and @xmath5 will not be further considered here as a separation factor .",
    "this section will focus on isolating clean photoproduction and two - photon final states .",
    "the large hadroproduction cross sections are a background to these events .",
    "the cuts discussed here are geared toward reducing the hadroproduction background and thereby differentiating between the three production processes .",
    "rhic data@xcite show that almost all hadronic interactions break up both nuclei .",
    "in contrast , photoproduction should only dissociate the target nucleus while two - photon interactions should leave both nuclei intact .",
    "however , the photoproduction and two - photon interactions occur at moderate impact parameters , less than 50 ( 500 ) fm at rhic ( lhc ) , where one or more additional photons may be exchanged .    for heavy nuclei like lead or gold , the additional photons can excite one or both nuclei , leading to nuclear breakup .",
    "except for the common impact parameter , these additional photons are independent of the two - photon or photonuclear events@xcite .",
    "the probabilities for excitation are significant .",
    "the probability of a single given nucleus being excited in a collision at @xmath382 is about 30% with gold at rhic , rising to 35% for lead at the lhc@xcite .",
    "as @xmath17 rises , the excitation probability drops as @xmath383 .",
    "the breakup probability scales as @xmath384 so that for even slightly lighter nuclei like argon or silicon the breakup probability is considerably reduced . since the nuclear breakup probabilities are independent of each other , the probability for both nuclei to dissociate is simply the square of the single dissociation probability .",
    "one way to select photoproduction events is to eliminate events where both nuclei break up .",
    "this should eliminate almost all of the hadroproduction events while retaining most of the photoproduction and two - photon interactions . unfortunately , there are no calculations of the hadronic interaction cross sections without accompanying nuclear breakup .",
    "indeed , such a calculation is problematic because too little is known about the recoil energy transfer in the nucleus .",
    "however , using a glauber calculation , we find that the cross section for a single nucleon - single nucleon interaction in an au+au collision is about 700 mb , 10% of the total hadronic cross section . at rhic and lhc energies",
    "even soft nuclear interactions involve significant energy transfer .",
    "thus phase space considerations dictate that the interacting nucleons are likely to be ejected from the nucleus .",
    "there could then be considerable momentum transferred to the nuclear fragments .",
    "here we assume that each nucleus has a 10% chance of remaining intact . with these assumptions ,",
    "the heavy quark hadroproduction cross sections with one nucleus remaining intact are not too different from those presented in section [ hadrosec ] .",
    "the 10% chance of remaining intact may be high , but , to be conservative , we will use the rates in section [ hadrosec ] to calculate the hadronic backgrounds to photoproduction .",
    "the rejection factor @xmath385 is the probability of finding a rapidity gap with width @xmath6 in a hadronic collision , @xmath386 , where @xmath387 is the average multiplicity per unit rapidity . here , we will only consider charged particles but with a calorimeter to detect neutrals , the rejection would be enhanced .",
    "the ua1 collaboration parameterized the charged particle multiplicity as @xmath388@xcite . neglecting the small difference between @xmath16 and @xmath26 collisions , at midrapidity at rhic , @xmath389 @xcite , rising to @xmath390 at the lhc .",
    "most modern experiments use forward detectors like beam - beam counters to measure particle production over a wide rapidity range .",
    "these counters can be used to find rapidity gaps . here",
    "we will consider two charged particle detectors each covering 2 units of rapidity on each side of a central detector , representative of modern experiments .",
    "we scale the midrapidity multiplicities by 0.6 because @xmath391 decreases away from midrapidity",
    ".    for photoproduction , requiring a single rapidity gap will reject all but @xmath392 of the hadronic interactions at rhic while at lhc the rejection for a similar detector is @xmath393 .",
    "these factors , calculated for @xmath26 collisions , should be conservative for @xmath4 and @xmath3 collisions where there is typically more than a single nucleon - single nucleon collision .",
    "these factors would also apply to the rejection of photoproduction backgrounds when considering two - photon reactions .",
    "since there are two rapidity gaps in two - photon interactions , these rejection factors are squared .",
    "the cdf collaboration has experimentally observed comparable rejection factors in a study of diffractive bottom production@xcite .",
    "they isolated a diffractively produced bottom sample from @xmath16 collisions@xcite with a signal to noise ratio of 3:1 despite the fact that diffractive production was 1/160 of the total hadronic @xmath17 cross section .",
    "this corresponded to @xmath394 , smaller than the @xmath385 values calculated above .",
    "this is probably because the cdf forward counters cover 2.7 units of rapidity and are supplemented with forward calorimeters that detect neutrals .",
    "thus the rejection factors are not unrealistic and could even be improved on with more solid angle coverage .",
    "of course , for nuclear beams the higher multiplicities per participant pair should increase the rejection factors , even for single nucleon - single nucleon interactions , due to possible secondary interactions .",
    "the rapidity gap requirements should reject relatively few signal events since photoproduction always leads to a rapidity gap .",
    "the exceptions are the events that are accompanied by additional electromagnetic interactions .",
    "a small fraction of these breakups will involve high energy photons which produce final state particles that fill in the rapidity gap , causing the signal event to be lost . even at the lhc ,",
    "the breakup probability due to high energy photons is quite small and events with additional particles should not appreciably affect the signal . if it is necessary to also require that one nucleus remains intact , then signal loss will need to be considered but such loss will not affect the viability of the measurement .",
    "other backgrounds are neglected here .",
    "examples include single diffractive ( hadronic ) charm production and double - pomeron interactions .",
    "single diffractive production will have one rapidity gap and could potentially mimic charm photoproduction .",
    "however , the diffractive final state would be produced quite near the beam rapidity , forward of the predominantly photoproduced charm .",
    "double - pomeron charm production will be in the central region with two rapidity gaps . because the pomeron has such a short range",
    ", both single and double diffractive interactions can only occur over a very narrow range of impact parameters so that their @xmath3 cross sections should be small @xcite .",
    "the other major background , beam - gas interactions , is detector and vacuum system specific and will not be discussed here .",
    "conservatively , both the rapidity gaps and nuclear breakup criteria should reject more than @xmath395 of the hadronic events .",
    "although these criteria are not completely independent , comparing the numbers in sections [ photosec ] - [ gamgamsec ] shows that application of either criteria should lead to a good signal to noise ratio for selecting either photoproduction or two - photon interactions .",
    "if 99% of the hadronic events with @xmath92 can be rejected , then hadroproduction is only a small background to photoproduction of heavy quarks , one that can be controlled to the degree necessary to measure shadowing by comparing @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "one could also select events with two rapidity gaps and no nuclear breakup to search for two - photon interactions .",
    "however , in almost all cases , the two - photon cross sections are a factor of at least 1,000 smaller than the photoproduction cross sections . this factor is smaller than the single - gap @xmath385 calculated above as well as larger than rejection obtained by cdf and unlikely to be achieved in a real experiment .",
    "selecting two - photon events may require completely reconstructing the events and using the low total @xmath5 of the event as a final selection criteria .",
    "this reconstruction will necessarily have a very low overall efficiency , thus requiring very large data sets .    in conclusion , both rapidity gaps and the absence of nuclear breakup are effective criteria to separate photoproduction interactions",
    ". charged - particle multiplicity and other event characteristics may also be useful in refining the event selection .",
    "once a sample of photoproduction events have been isolated , charm and bottom production may be studied with conventional selection techniques such as prompt leptons , separated vertices , and @xmath396 or @xmath397 meson reconstruction .",
    "we have calculated the total cross sections , quark @xmath5 and @xmath6 distributions , and pair mass spectra for hadronic , photonuclear and two - photon production of heavy quark pairs using a consistent set of quark masses and scales .",
    "the hadronic processes have the largest cross sections , followed by photoproduction and two - photon interactions .",
    "however , using the characteristics of rapidity gaps and nuclear breakup , photoproduction and two - photon processes should be cleanly separable .",
    "photoproduction and two - photon measurements can be used to test the qcd calculations .",
    "shadowing has a 10% effect on @xmath0 production with heavy nuclei at rhic , rising to 20% at the lhc . by comparing",
    "the production cross sections in @xmath4 and @xmath3 collisions , most theoretical uncertainties cancel so that shadowing can be accurately measured if the photon flux is well known . by using appropriate calibration signals , it appears that the photon flux uncertainties can be understood and useful gluon shadowing measurements made .",
