    "measuring a physical parameter precisely has been one of the most fundamental pursuits in science . improved accuracy in estimating the value of an unknown parameter has almost always lead to new physical insights together with an access to new and unexplored phenomena @xcite .",
    "one therefore wonders if there is a fundamental limitation on how precisely a parameter can be measured . for a specific experiment ,",
    "the answer depends on the amount of @xmath3 used for the measurement : quantifying limits on precision thereby gets redefined to quantifying the amount of resources @xmath4 used .",
    "resources have been quantified earlier in varied ways . for every such way ,",
    "there is a corresponding error bound .",
    "the simplest of these equates the resource count(@xmath5 ) to the total count of the number of times an experiment is repeated , or the number of probe particles used(@xmath6 ) .",
    "the corresponding bound is known to scale as @xmath7 for models using classical strategies ( following the central - limit theorem ) .",
    "however , it has been found that quantum mechanically correlated probe states can significantly improve the precision , bounded by the heisenberg limit(hl ) of @xmath8@xcite . in a more general approach",
    ", resource has been quantified as the count of number of times the measurement system is sampled@xcite or via generalized versions of uncertainty relations@xcite .    all of these approaches of quantifying resources in a model depend on specificities of the dynamics considered in the measurement process .",
    "however , independent of the model , information of precision is contained in its output , which is a set of numbers(the possible outcomes ) with associated probabilities .",
    "it is therefore expected that , a general quantification of resource that uses only the set of possible outcomes and the associated probabilities , can be developed .",
    "this characterization would be independent of the specific dynamical model .    in this paper",
    ", we explore this approach towards quantifying resource count(@xmath5 ) .",
    "the error in a given measurement depends only on the output probability distribution , and varies with different distributions .",
    "one can therefore ask : is there a distribution , for a given set of outcomes , that minimizes the error ?     is to be estimated , is characterized with a classical distribution @xmath9 over the possible outcomes @xmath10 . in a quantum measurement , starting with a state @xmath11 , the probe evolves to a state @xmath12 . for an appropriate povm ,",
    "the outcomes @xmath13 are the eigen - values of the observable @xmath14 , being measured .",
    "this observable has a spectral decomposition @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the projection in to the eigen - space of @xmath14 with eigen - value @xmath17 .",
    "the probabilities for this case are given by @xmath18 .",
    "if viewed as a black - box , both models output a set of possible outcomes @xmath19 with corresponding distributions . ]    here , we explicitly construct such a distribution and show that it is unique .",
    "the corresponding error is found to scale inversely with the number of outcomes(m ) . since no particular dynamics(classical or quantum)is assumed ,",
    "any measurement scheme that yields a finite , discrete set of outcomes will follow this error bound .",
    "interestingly , it turns out to be impossible to design an estimation strategy that can achieve this bound , exactly .",
    "furthermore , we propose an ansatz , motivated by the scaling of the error , characterizing the count of resources used in the estimation @xmath4 , as the number of possible outcomes(@xmath20 ) .    for a fixed distribution , the error depends on the information contained in the distribution .",
    "fisher information precisely quantifies this for any arbitrary output probability distribution while a lower bound for the error of an unbiased estimator , corresponding to the given distribution is set by the cramer - rao inequality@xcite . here",
    ", we show that the unique distribution that minimizes the error , saturates the cramer - rao inequality .",
    "also , we show that this distribution maximizes the fisher information .",
    "we limit ourselves to an analysis of a general measurement model for estimating a single parameter with a natural(or true ) value @xmath21 , that has a discrete set of outcomes @xmath10 with corresponding probabilities @xmath9 .",
    "the number of outcomes here is @xmath22 .",
    "the expected value is then equal to the natural value : @xmath23 while , @xmath24 is the probability of obtaining @xmath17 as the outcome or estimated value from a measurement.(fig .",
    "1 )    for an estimate of the parameter , @xmath25 , one then needs to infer the natural value @xmath21 , using the constraint @xmath26 . here",
    ", @xmath27 is the root - mean - square - error(rmse ) of the distribution@xcite .",
    "the range of values of @xmath21 which satisfy the above inequality with @xmath25 ( the obtained value ) , is the inferred range of the natural value .",
    "the width of this range is the precision of the measurement .",
    "* example : * let us consider a measurement with two possible outcomes , say , @xmath28 .",
    "the parameter to be estimated , @xmath21 is in the range @xmath29 $ ]",
    ". the associated probabilities at the end of the system - probe interaction are @xmath30 , so that the expected value is @xmath21 .",
    "this form of dependence of the probabilities on @xmath21 is directed by the dynamics of interaction .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is an unknown of the system .",
    "the probe _ picks up _ this value during its interaction with the system .",
    "it is to be estimated after a measurement .",
    "suppose that we repeat this experiment @xmath6 times .",
    "the possible values of the average are @xmath31 .",
    "these are the @xmath32 possible outcomes of the overall experiment , i.e , this is the set : @xmath13 .",
    "the associated probability distribution is a binomial : @xmath33    the only unknown is @xmath21 , which is the peak of this distribution .",
    "where ever the peak is , a measurement result will have to be within the peak s width : i.e. , wherever @xmath21 is , the estimate obtained from a measurement , @xmath34 will be within the range @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "therefore , this estimate can be used to infer the possible values of @xmath21 .    now",
    ", suppose that we obtained an estimate , @xmath34 after the measurement .",
    "this will be one of the @xmath32 possible outcomes : @xmath36 .",
    "we can then conclude that the value of @xmath21 is such that , it includes the value @xmath34 in it s width , i.e. , @xmath21 satisfies the inequality @xmath26 .",
    "the standard error @xmath37 is in this case given by @xmath38 .",
    "solving for the range of @xmath21 that satisfies the above inequality , we can show that asymptotically , this range is @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "whence , the error in this estimation is @xmath40 .",
    "this is the error for a binomial distribution . in general",
    ", we can design an experiment that assigns any other probability distribution @xmath24 , that correlates the @xmath6 repetitions . using the corresponding standard error @xmath37",
    ", we can obtain the range of @xmath21 that can be inferred from an estimate @xmath34 .",
    "this error may be smaller than @xmath40 , depending on the probability distribution .",
    "the question we ask here is , for a general set of outcomes @xmath13 what is the associated distribution @xmath24 that minimizes the error ?",
    "further , what is the value of this minimum error ? .",
    "such a distribution , if unique , would then provide a standard for comparing a wide range of measurement models with varied nature of resources @xcite .",
    "this distribution will be referred to hereafter as the minimum - error - distribution(med ) .",
    "to construct such a distribution with the least error , one can arrange the discrete @xmath22 outcomes of the model , @xmath41 in ascending order , such that the interval @xmath42 $ ] is divided in to @xmath20 bins : @xmath43 , [ x_1,x_2]\\cdots [ x_{m-1},x_m]$ ] . the expected value @xmath21 falls in to one such bin , say @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "one can then construct the med with @xmath45 for every @xmath46 , sparing the two special points @xmath47 and @xmath48(fig.2(c ) ) .",
    "the probabilities @xmath49 and @xmath50 are trivially assigned from the two constraints of the problem : ( 1)@xmath51 is the expected value and ( 2 ) the distribution is normalized:@xmath52 .",
    "formally , the med can be stated as : @xmath53    using cauchy - schwartz inequality , it is straightforward to show that this distribution has a lower rmse than any other arbitrary distribution @xmath54 with the same expected value @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "the second moment of this distribution is @xmath55 , and that of the @xmath56 is @xmath57 when @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "we are to show that @xmath59 .",
    "we start with an auxiliary distribution on an auxiliary set of variables .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 be a distribution over two variables , @xmath62 defined as ( see fig .",
    "2(b ) ) @xmath63    @xmath64 clearly , @xmath65 .",
    "this is a third distribution with the same expected value , and a second moment @xmath66 .",
    "we complete the proof by showing that @xmath67 .",
    "the first inequality follows by adding the two cauchy schwarz inequalities : @xmath68 noting that @xmath69 , we obtain the second inequality : @xmath70 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "it is also a known optimization problem @xcite .     on @xmath10 ,",
    "such that the expected value @xmath71 falls between @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( b. ) from this arbitrary distribution , an auxiliary distribution , @xmath74 can be constructed with the auxiliary variables @xmath75 .",
    "while this two - point distribution has the same expected value @xmath21 , it has a lower error than the distribution @xmath54 .",
    "( c. ) a plot of the minimum - error - distribution , @xmath76 against @xmath17 .",
    "the probability is zero everywhere except at two points , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the rmse of this distribution is lower than that of the auxiliary distribution , and hence lower than that of any arbitrary distribution with the same expected value . ]    .",
    "it is easy to check that the rmse or the error for the med is @xmath77 which depends on the constraint @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "this is maximum at the midpoint , @xmath79 , with a value @xmath80 .",
    "however , it varies within the bin .",
    "therefore , in order to find a bound of rmse or the variance corresponding to this distribution , one needs to consider the worst value it can take i.e. the maximal value of @xmath81 for any @xmath21 . for a specific bean , the maximum the variance can take is @xmath80 .",
    "for any @xmath21 , one therefore needs to maximize @xmath81 over all bins , that is , over all @xmath82 .    to find the overall bound",
    ", one can first note that the maximum is always greater than its average value : @xmath83 .",
    "the equality holds when @xmath84 are uniformly spaced and therefore , this is the case when the error for @xmath56 is the lowest : this value is @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , one can scale and translate @xmath86 and @xmath87 to @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively , without loss of generality .",
    "the error of the @xmath56 is then bounded by @xmath90 .",
    "note that this scaling , in effect , non - dimensionalizes the observable .",
    "thus , the error is now a relative error , and hence dimensionless .    from ( 2 )",
    ", it may be noted that @xmath81 is precisely zero at the end points of the interval : @xmath91 .",
    "however , these zero values do not imply sharp measurements or an absolute bound .",
    "for example , if @xmath25 is a value estimated from an actual measurement following the model , then , the range of the true value @xmath21 can only be inferred from condition @xmath92 .",
    "clearly , the range of @xmath21 that satisfy this inequality is well within @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "this interval can be broken in to two neighboring intervals : @xmath94 \\cup [ x_r , x_{r+1}]$ ] .",
    "@xmath95 is different in these two neighboring intervals . in the former ,",
    "it is @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , within this interval , the range of @xmath21 satisfying the condition @xmath92 is given by @xmath97 . or , equivalently ,",
    "@xmath98 $ ] .",
    "similarly , the required range within the latter interval , @xmath99 $ ] , is @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "this yields a total range of @xmath101 $ ] , that satisfies the above condition .",
    "this , indeed is @xmath102 when the @xmath17 s are all uniformly spaced , and @xmath87 , @xmath86 are scaled to @xmath28 .",
    "this is our main result : we have explicitly constructed a distribution that minimizes the rmse for a measurement model yielding @xmath22 discrete set of outcomes and found that the error bound scales as @xmath1 . in what follows , we will analyze the implications and consequences of these findings .      for a given random variable @xmath103 and a given distribution @xmath104 ,",
    "the cramer - rao bound sets a lower bound on the error in estimating the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "this bound is expressed in terms of the score @xmath105 , defined as @xmath106 .",
    "the square - error , @xmath107 is bounded below by the inverse of the fisher information , @xmath108 .",
    "one can note that , the cramer - rao bound does not provide an absolute bound on the attainable precision in a general estimation ; it provides a bound for estimations using a particular distribution .",
    "this means , the bound for @xmath104 may be surpassed by using a different distribution @xmath109 for estimating the same parameter @xmath21 .",
    "one can further note that , the cramer - rao bound does not guarantee attainability . though it sets a lower bound on the error , an estimator which saturates this bound for the given distribution might not exist .",
    "the bound is saturated only for certain distributions . in this section",
    "we demonstrate that the med saturates the inequality and it has the largest fisher information among all those distributions that saturate the inequality .",
    "the score for med is given by @xmath110    therefore , the fisher information is @xmath111 , for @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the error bound is @xmath113 . as seen in the main text ,",
    "the rmse of the med is exactly equal to this expression .",
    "it follows that the med has the largest fisher information among all those distributions that saturate the cramer - rao inequality .",
    "let @xmath9 be any distribution , and @xmath114 be its fisher information .",
    "if this distribution saturates the cramer - rao inequality for some estimator , the rmse for that estimator will be @xmath115 . since the med has the least rmse , it follows that @xmath116 .",
    "thus , the med has the largest fisher information , among all those distributions that saturate the cramer - rao inequality for some estimator .      to analyze the physical consequences of med and its bound",
    ", we introduce a simple graphical representation by comparing the error @xmath37 or equivalently , the second moment @xmath117 @xcite against @xmath21 .",
    "after rescaling @xmath87 and @xmath86 to @xmath118 , we have @xmath21 also bounded by @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath119 lies in the range @xmath120 $ ] . the graph is therefore confined to a rectangle ( fig.3 ) .",
    "furthermore , the absolute limiting parabola @xmath121 which sets the bound for zero error .",
    "henceforth , this parabola will be referred as the zero error curve(zec ) .    :",
    "the limiting curve , or the zec ( zero error curve ) is the parabola @xmath122 ) , such that the region below ( shaded in dark ) is physically inaccessible .",
    "any measurement model is represented by a point @xmath123 with the rmse given by the square root of its distance from the zec .",
    "the polyline representing the second moment for the minimum - error - distribution , @xmath124 is plotted for @xmath125 .",
    "the region between this polyline and the zec ( shaded in light ) is inaccessible for any model with m+1 or lesser outcomes .",
    "the error - bound for the @xmath56 corresponds to its optimal distance from the zec .",
    "the parabola for a binomial distribution ( shown for @xmath126 , see text ) is tangential to the corresponding @xmath127 at the endpoints , @xmath128 . ]    in order to visualize the med , we note that the bound on the minimum error is achieved for equally spaced @xmath129 $ ] .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath130 , with @xmath131 .",
    "the x - axis ( fig.3 ) can now be visualized as broken into @xmath20 bins , with the true value @xmath21 belonging to one such bin . also , the second moment is @xmath132    one can right away note that this is not a smooth function of @xmath21 .",
    "instead , it depends on the bin in which @xmath21 falls and is a straight line within a particular bin . furthermore , the slope of the line depends on the specific bin and therefore on @xmath21 , which makes the curve a polyline .",
    "such a polyline for @xmath125 is shown in fig .",
    "3 .    since these polylines correspond to the minimum error for a given @xmath20",
    ", one can conclude that points which are below the @xmath127 and above the zec are physically inaccessible to any measurement model with @xmath22 distinct outcomes . for large @xmath20 , the @xmath127 of - course approach the zec , as is expected physically .",
    "the second moment of any arbitrary distribution on these @xmath22 variables lies above the polyline corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "for example , one can consider a binomial distribution with @xmath22 outcomes .",
    "this distribution can be constructed from a simple model with two possible measurement outcomes , @xmath28 , used to estimate the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding probabilities are @xmath133 . for @xmath6",
    "uncorrelated repetitions of this experiment , the resource count is @xmath6 together with @xmath32 possible outcomes , @xmath134 or equivalently , @xmath135 ( for @xmath136 ) . here , @xmath137 .",
    "the probabilities are binomial in @xmath46 , with the second - moment @xmath138 representing a parabola ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    of course",
    ", this parabola lies completely above the @xmath124 ( corresponding to this @xmath6 ) , which is tangential at the two end - points ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "one can note that @xmath124 for any lower number of outcomes cuts this parabola .",
    "but by definition , @xmath124 is the limiting curve for any model with fixed outcomes .",
    "one can thereby conclude that for a binomial distribution with @xmath32 outcomes , there is no way to surpass its precision completely(at all @xmath21 ) , using lower number of outcomes , for any arbitrary distributions .",
    "however , for same @xmath6 , there can be several distributions with a tighter bound than the binomial and limited by the @xmath56 .    on the contrary ,",
    "the precision of med can be surpassed using uncorrelated , binomial distribution with larger number of outcomes .",
    "the number @xmath20 is therefore the only significant factor here for precision bound and not the actual distribution .",
    "this observation is consistent with our earlier result , that for a measurement with @xmath22 discrete outcomes , the precision is bounded by @xmath90 , suggesting a possible characterization of the resource count using the number @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we therefore propose an ansatz :    _ ansatz : _",
    "m , the number of outcomes , is the resource count for a measurement .",
    "this implies , for a measurement model that uses @xmath6 resources , the error is absolutely bounded by @xmath140 .    in the rest of the paper , we will address the question of possibility of designing a physical experiment that achieves the bound of @xmath56",
    "in order to attain the minimum - error , the system dynamics should result in the outcomes @xmath10 being distributed following the @xmath56(1 ) .",
    "however , this distribution , unlike the binomial , is not smooth in @xmath21 .",
    "this implies some amount of prior information of @xmath21 for choosing the appropriate system , probe and dynamics .",
    "the question then is how precise this prior information needs to be ?",
    "one can right away observe that since the length of each bin is @xmath141 , this amounts to demanding an apriori knowledge of @xmath21 with a precision @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , such a measurement procedure will not add any further value to the already known result .",
    "we illustrate this with an example .    _",
    "a thought experiment : _ let us consider the well known example of estimating an unknown phase with a precision of @xmath142 using an @xmath6 particle entangled state .",
    "we shall demonstrate that this estimation is incomplete without attaining the med in its final stage , thus demanding an apriori knowledge of the unknown phase .    in this case",
    ", a highly entangled input state @xmath143 evolves to @xmath144 , such that the phase @xmath145 is estimated from @xmath146 , through an appropriate povm .",
    "one choice of such a povm is @xmath147 , where @xmath148 , is orthogonal to @xmath149 .",
    "this yields an expectation value of @xmath150 with an error of @xmath151 .",
    "when repeated @xmath152 times , the error scales down to @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , a measurement result , @xmath154 , can be used to obtain an estimate of @xmath145 with a precision of @xmath155 .    in this measurement ,",
    "the last step is critical : obtaining @xmath156 from @xmath154 . for @xmath154 in the range @xmath157",
    ", there are @xmath6 possible values of @xmath156 , given by @xmath158 .",
    "this is a well known problem for unknown phase estimation , and several strategies are proposed to resolve the ambiguity @xcite .",
    "let s be such a resolution strategy , used as part of this measurement , to resolve among these @xmath6 values of @xmath156 .",
    "the @xmath6 possible values of @xmath156 are spread out uniformly on the unit circle , with a gap of @xmath159 between them .",
    "therefore , the strategy s , is a measurement , that resolves these values with a precision of @xmath160 .",
    "we shall now demonstrate that such a strategy leads to @xmath56 for the @xmath156 and therefore require an apriori knowledge of the phase .    as a resolution strategy , s associates each of the @xmath6 possible values of @xmath156 with a probability , such that the expected value is @xmath145 .",
    "furthermore , to ensure that the strategy resolves the `` correct '' value , the rmse of this distribution should not exceed @xmath160 . since these @xmath6 values are uniformly spread over an interval of @xmath157",
    ", @xmath160 is indeed the minimum error that any distribution can attain .",
    "however , by uniqueness , the @xmath56 is the only distribution that attains this value .",
    "therefore , the strategy s involves attaining @xmath56 , over a set of @xmath6 variables , thereby demanding an apriori knowledge of the parameter .",
    "for a measurement with a fixed number of outcomes @xmath10 , i.e. , for a fixed @xmath20 and for any probability mass - function @xmath161 , the attainable precision is shown to be bounded below by @xmath162 .",
    "therefore , the relative error scales inversely with @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the distribution which attains this bound ( med ) is constructed explicitly , and it is found to be unique .    a simple ansatz is proposed equating the resource count to the number of discrete outcomes , irrespective of the actual values @xmath163,or the probabilities .",
    "therefore , in quantum metrology , one can now compare widely different measurement strategies , by counting only the possible outcomes the measurement model will yield .",
    "for equal number of probable outputs , one can conclude the resources used to be equal in otherwise differing experimental schemes .",
    "we observe that a physical implementation of med demands an additional apriori information on the natural value @xmath21 , in any strategy , making @xmath20 an under count .",
    "while this is known for phase estimation strategies , we show this result in general for any single parameter estimation .",
    "since this is a theoretical limitation , we believe that this can be relevant for quantum foundations .    in a quantum measurement ,",
    "the resource count is the number of distinct eigen values of the observable .",
    "it depends only on the observable . in general , resource is maximum when the observable is totally non degenerate .",
    "that is , none of its eigen states are degenerate",
    ". however , of practical relevance are systems of identical particles that are either symmetric or anti symmetric under particle exchange .",
    "therefore , the observable has to satisfy an additional constraint- it should be invariant under all particle permutations . with this constraint , an observable is never totally non degenerate .",
    "therefore , maximizing the resource count over this class of observables is nontrivial , and depends on the system .",
