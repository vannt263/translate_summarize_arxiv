    "arguably one of the deepest insights to emerge from string theory considerations in recent years is the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "holographically relating gravitational phenomena in the bulk to a conformal field theory living on the boundary , the correspondence has wide reaching application in furthering our understanding of either gravitational or particle physics that is otherwise difficult to calculate directly .",
    "for instance , if it is possible to make calculations on the gravity side then one can infer information about the cft and conversely if the cft is calculable then one can infer information about the intractable gravity .",
    "of course there are also examples where both the gravity and field theory sides can be independently studied .",
    "an example of this is the hawking - page phase transition between thermal ads and the schwarzschild ads black hole @xcite and the corresponding confinement / deconfinement phase transition in the large @xmath1 limit of @xmath2 super yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "another such example is the conjecture by horowitz and silverstein that a soliton configuration , a so - called ` bubble of nothing ' , is dual to closed string tachyon condensation @xcite .",
    "examples of such configurations are the ads solitons found by horowitz and myers @xcite and the eguchi - hanson solitons found by clarkson and mann @xcite in 5 dimensions . both of these soliton configurations were shown to be the lowest energy solutions to the einstein equations in their asymptotic classes and hence represent ground states .",
    "the 5-dimensional eguchi - hanson soliton was subsequently obtained by copsey @xcite using different methods , and higher odd - dimensional versions were obtained by clarkson and mann @xcite .",
    "inspired by the ads soliton being of lowest energy it was shown by surya , schleich and witt in @xcite that despite a lack of a phase transition between thermal ads and ads black holes with ricci flat horizons @xcite there is indeed a ( somewhat different ) phase transition between such black holes and the ads soliton .",
    "furthermore , this transition was again shown to be dual to a confinement / deconfinement phase transition in the gauge theory .",
    "recently hikida and iizuka @xcite performed a detailed study in @xmath3 of the phase behaviour of the field theory dual to eguchi - hanson solitons ( ehs ) , orbifolded ads ( oads ) and orbifolded schwarzschild - ads black holes ( osads ) .",
    "they have identified both the ehs and oads as corresponding to local vacua of the gauge theory with the ehs being the expected ground state and dual to closed string tachyon condensation .",
    "this analysis did very little insofar as the gravitational side of the correspondence is concerned .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to provide such an analysis in arbitrary odd dimension with a primary focus on @xmath4 , as these dimensions are of specific relevance in superstring theory .",
    "we start with the three known static , uncharged , asymptotically ads/@xmath0 spacetimes in @xmath5 dimensions whose metrics take the general form @xmath6 where the subscript @xmath7 denotes the ehs , oads and osads respectively and the angular coordinates take value in the range @xmath8 $ ] , @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 has period @xmath11 . for the ehs to be free of conical singularities",
    "we must impose @xmath12 for some integer @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the metric functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 take the following form for the three metrics : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is related to the cosmological constant via @xmath18 , the soliton radius @xmath19 is restricted by the relation @xmath20 as is explained in @xcite and @xmath21 is the mass parameter for the black hole . for most of what follows , using @xmath21 is inconvenient so we introduce instead the horizon radius @xmath22 in terms of which @xmath23 .",
    "smooth instantons can be constructed for all three solutions by performing the wick rotation @xmath24 and identifying @xmath25 with period @xmath26 . for the ehs and oads @xmath27 can take any value whereas for osads the elimination of conical singularities requires @xmath28",
    "we are now ready to evaluate the euclidean actions for the three solutions for use in thermodynamic analysis .",
    "if one attempts to compute the action for a non - compact manifold one obtains an infinite answer due to the infinite volume , which is clearly undesirable .",
    "we will employ two separate methods for rendering the action finite : the first uses a reference background as a subtraction and the second uses an insertion of boundary terms in the action that leave the equations of motion unchanged .",
    "we will perform the former for arbitrary dimension and the latter for the specific case of @xmath29 as a consistency check .",
    "the background subtraction method uses the einstein - hilbert action with the gibbons - hawking counterterm : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the d - dimensional newton constant , @xmath32 is the determinant of the ( euclidean ) metric on @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the ricci scalar , @xmath35 is the determinant of the ( euclidean ) metric on @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the trace of the extrinsic curvature of @xmath36 in the metric @xmath32 and the background metric respectively . for the solutions we are interested in ,",
    "the boundary terms vanish and the ricci scalar is given simply by @xmath39 so the action reduces to @xmath40 which is just a constant multiplying the infinite volume of the manifold @xmath33 .",
    "to render the action finite , we need to appropriately subtract the background action by integrating @xmath41 out to some large value @xmath42 , matching the periodicities of the angular coordinates and taking the limit as @xmath43 . in @xcite it was shown that in @xmath44 the ehs is perturbatively the solution of lowest energy . although no such analysis has been performed for the higher dimensional soliton solutions , we expect this result to remain valid and hence we use the ehs as the background .",
    "thus , we are ultimately interested in the relative action @xmath45 .",
    "to ensure the periodicities of the angular coordinates match up properly when taking the limit @xmath43 , the following matching conditions must be applied : @xmath46 @xmath47 with these conditions , the actions can be written in terms of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which are both known .",
    "the final expressions for the background subtracted actions are @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 \\label{eq : ib}\\ ] ] we note that in choosing @xmath53 we are able to reproduce the results of @xcite , albeit in a slightly different way .",
    "the other method we consider renders individual actions finite without invoking some non - unique background geometry .",
    "it employs boundary terms in the action which leave the equations of motion the same but which have a non - trivial effect on the stress tensor .",
    "the action we consider is @xmath54 which is very similar to ( [ eq : action1 ] ) but with two key distinctions .",
    "first , there is no longer a background to subtract so @xmath38 is no longer present and the boundary contribution from the extrinsic curvature no longer vanishes .",
    "secondly , there is a new boundary term in which @xmath55 is a dimensionless function of the boundary geometry ; specifically @xmath55 can only be a function of the boundary riemann tensor , its contractions and their derivatives @xcite    an algorithm for calculating @xmath55 for general @xmath56 in terms of a series expansion in the ads radius was put forth in ref . @xcite and",
    "the explicit form in @xmath3 has been constructed in ref .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that such a @xmath55 indeed exists in @xmath29 .",
    "the series expansion in the ads radius effectively amounts to a series expansion in inverse powers of the boundary radius so in what follows we will choose the convenient basis @xmath57 where @xmath42 is the radius of the boundary , not the boundary ricci scalar .",
    "a quick computation shows that in @xmath29 the extrinsic curvature for all three solutions is given by @xmath58 . bringing everything together , we find the actions ( [ eq : action2 ] ) for all three solutions of interest are finite provided @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 which agrees exactly with what one gets from the algorithm of ref .",
    "this  quick and dirty \" algorithm to find @xmath55 by writing it as a power series in inverse powers of the boundary radius and then finding the coefficients that render the actions finite generalizes to any number of dimensions .",
    "a more thorough discussion of how to write down @xmath55 in any dimension was given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the resulting actions are given explicitly by @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 it is easily verified that defining @xmath65 and @xmath66 reproduces ( [ eq : ia ] ) and ( [ eq : ib ] ) respectively for the case @xmath67 so both methods are seen to produce the same physics as they should ; for related analyses carried out in @xmath3 see refs .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of generality in what follows we use the background subtracted actions ( [ eq : ia ] ) and ( [ eq : ib ] ) , the only difference being the zero of the action which we choose to be the ehs .",
    "we also emphasize that there are two independent thermodynamic parameters , namely @xmath22 and @xmath17 , and it should be understood that @xmath68 and @xmath69 ; @xmath70 and @xmath71 are held fixed as they define the dimension and topology respectively and can not change ) there is a topological transition from spaces with orbifold parameter @xmath72 to spaces with orbifold parameter @xmath73 eventually ending in the stable vacuum of @xmath74 ; this topological transition is very special to @xmath75 and is not present in the higher dimensions we consider in this paper . ] .",
    "we make note of the fact that the oads action ( [ eq : ia ] ) , and hence the free energy @xmath76 , is always positive and so the oads geometry is always an unstable phase .",
    "that is to say there is no order parameter that can be tuned to bring about a continuous phase transition between the oads and ehs geometries .",
    "this supports the notion mentioned earlier that both the ehs and oads solutions are vacuum states with the ehs being the lowest energy ground state .",
    "in fact , the thermodynamic energy , @xmath77 , of oads is given by @xmath78 the oads geometry then lowers its free energy to zero by tunneling to the ehs geometry at the rate @xmath79 .",
    "the entropy , @xmath80 , and the heat capacity , @xmath81 , both vanish for oads as they ought to for a horizonless spacetime .    to analyse the thermodynamic behaviour of the black hole it is convenient to introduce the hawking - page action @xmath82 so that we can write @xmath83 .",
    "the thermodynamic energy of osads is found to be given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the black hole mass parameter defined previously and we immediately see the utility of ( [ eq : hp ] ) : the first term in ( [ eq : eb ] ) is due to @xmath86 and the second term is due to @xmath87 .",
    "we have already shown that the entropy and heat capacity vanish for @xmath86 so we conclude that these quantities are governed by the hawking - page action alone .",
    "as expected for the entropy , we find @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the area of the black hole horizon .",
    "similarly , the heat capacity is found to be @xmath90 which diverges at @xmath91 where @xmath92 signifying a first order phase transition .",
    "this is precisely where @xmath93 and hence signifies the transition between small and large black holes with @xmath94 giving the lowest possible temperature an osads black hole can have .",
    "next we want to look at the thermodynamic stability of the black hole .",
    "we have already concluded that oads is unstable and tunnels to ehs since its free energy is always positive .",
    "we thus would like to know if the black hole action ( [ eq : ib ] ) can be negative , that is to say if osads can be thermodynamically favoured over ehs . to establish this",
    ", we need to find some @xmath95 such that @xmath96 signifying the cross over from positive to negative free energy .",
    "if we define @xmath97 then we need to solve @xmath98 this equation is a simple polynomial of degree @xmath70 and it turns out we are guaranteed at least one real solution due to the mean value theorem : the action evaluated at @xmath91 is positive since @xmath99 whereas the action for sufficiently large @xmath100 is negative since @xmath101 we therefore know that such an @xmath102 exists and furthermore that @xmath103 . in fig .",
    "1 we have plotted ( [ eq : fchi ] ) for various values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 ; it is where the coloured lines intersect the x - axis that gives the position of @xmath104 . in plot ( a ) , @xmath67 is held fixed while @xmath71 is allowed to vary : it is clearly seen that as one increases @xmath71 , the value of @xmath102 increases as well . in plot ( b ) , @xmath105 is held fixed while @xmath70 varies : in contrast to increasing @xmath71 , as @xmath70 increases @xmath102 decreases . in both of these plots",
    "@xmath106 so our assertions that @xmath102 exist and that @xmath103 are seen to hold true .",
    "furthermore , we can conclude that since @xmath102 decreases with increasing @xmath70 there is ` less room ' for phase transitions to occur in higher dimensions whereas since @xmath102 increases with increasing @xmath71 there is ` more room ' for phase transitions to occur in more highly orbifolded topologies .",
    "since the free energy of oads is positive while that of osads can be positive or negative , there exists another critical point , @xmath107 , above which the free energy of osads is higher than oads and below which it is lower : this happens at @xmath108 and this is , not surprisingly , where the hawking - page action ( [ eq : hp ] ) vanishes .",
    "it is easily verified that @xmath109 .",
    "large black holes in the range @xmath110 have positive specific heat but this does not necessarily mean that they will be in a stable equilibrium with thermal radiation .",
    "indeed we can see from the arguments above that in the range @xmath111 the black hole has a higher free energy than the soliton and will thus lower its free energy by evaporating into thermal oads and subsequently tunneling to the soliton .",
    "furthermore , in the temperature range @xmath112 the large black hole has lower free energy than thermal oads but higher free energy than the ehs so it is more likely for thermal oads to tunnel to a large black hole configuration , which would then ultimately tunnel to the soliton , than it would be to tunnel to the soliton directly . in the temperature range @xmath113",
    "the large black hole has the lowest free energy and hence thermal oads and the ehs will tend to tunnel to the black hole configuration .",
    "such black holes have positive specific heat and are thermodynamically favoured and hence are genuinely in thermal equilibrium . small black holes on the other hand , corresponding to the range @xmath114 , possess a negative specific heat and hence they are thermodynamically unstable and will radiate to thermal oads and eventually tunnel to the soliton .",
    "in this paper we have studied the thermodynamic behaviour of eguchi - hanson solitons and orbifolded ads and sads spaces , generalising the work in refs . @xcite to arbitrary odd dimension . we have given a more thorough analysis on the gravity side than has previously been given for these spaces and we have left discussions related to the holographic dual description to these references and the appropriate references therein as the details are rigorously worked out .",
    "the gravity description presented here very strongly supports the idea that oads and ehs are both ( at least local ) vacua with the ehs being the ground state .",
    "indeed oads is the end point of black hole evaporation , signifying a local vacuum , but oads has a positive free energy and hence tunnels to the zero free energy ehs configuration .",
    "this indicates that the ehs is at least a lower energy local vacuum than oads .",
    "this is consistent with previous results @xcite that demonstrated that in @xmath44 ehs spacetimes are perturbatively of lowest energy in their topological class .",
    "while such an analysis remains to be done for the ehs in higher dimensions we anticipate the same outcome based on the results we have obtained .",
    "we have shown that the expected results for the entropy and the heat capacity are obtained for the osads solution and have uncovered a richer thermodynamic behaviour than in pure ads spaces .",
    "namely all of the general elements of the usual hawking - page analysis are present , such as the existence of large and small black holes and a range of large black holes that are not stable despite the positivity of their specific heat but the effect of the soliton as the thermal background is to make wider the range of unstable large black holes .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that there is a wider range of large black holes for which the free energy is still positive after dropping below the free energy of oads .",
