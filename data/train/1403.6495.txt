    "<S> we obtain a representation of pairing energies in phase space , for the lipkin - meshkov - glick and boson bardeen - cooper - schrieffer pairing mean - field like hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by means of a probability distribution of the quantum state in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we prove a correspondence between the points at which this probability distribution vanishes and the pairing energies . in principle , the vanishing of this probability distribution is experimentally accessible and additionally gives a method to visualize pairing energies across the model control parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> this result opens new ways to experimentally approach quantum pairing systems .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction_.- the concept of _ pairing energies _ is a fundamental ingredient in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bcs hamiltonian eigenvalues can be written as a sum of the energies of quasiparticles which are the called pairing energies . </S>",
    "<S> the bcs theory has also been widely applied to describe pairing correlations between nucleons in finite nuclei @xcite . here , we will consider two models describing pairing correlations : the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) and a more general bosonic bcs - like model . </S>",
    "<S> the lmg hamiltonian @xcite is a nuclear mean field plus state - dependent pairing interaction model , used to describe the quantum phase transition from spherical to deformed shapes in nuclei , which can be solved analytically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lmg model has been also employed in other fields of physics to describe many body systems such as quantum optics ( to generate spin squeezed states and to describe many particle entangled states ) @xcite or in condensed matter physics ( to characterize bose - einstein condensates and josephson junctions ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonic bcs - like model is also an exactly solvable pairing model that has been proposed to model quantum phase transitions to a fragmented state for repulsive pairing interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> boson models of arbitrary angular momentum involving repulsive pairing interactions have been used to support the validity of the interacting boson model in nuclear structure  @xcite .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we can represent a quantum state @xmath0 in phase - space by means of a quasiprobability distribution used in quantum mechanics , the so - called husimi distribution @xmath1 of a quantum state @xmath0 ( called @xmath2-function in quantum optics ) , which can be defined as the squared overlap between @xmath0 and an arbitrary coherent state , ( a more precise definition will be given below ) and which plays a fundamental role in many branches of quantum physics , mainly in the study of quantum optics in phase space . here </S>",
    "<S> we shall focus on the zeros of this phase - space representation of @xmath0 , their physical meaning and their relation to pairing energies of the lmg pairing model . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the zeros of the phase - space distribution @xmath1 determine the quantum state @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the zeros of @xmath1 are experimentally measurable for some cases , which provides a way to reconstruct the associated quantum state @xmath0 , a basic problem in quantum information theory . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for spin systems , the vanishing of the @xmath3 at a point in phase space can be tested in principle , by means of a stern - gerlach apparatus [ see later for a discussion on experimental setups ] . </S>",
    "<S> also , the time evolution of coherent states of light in a kerr medium is visualized by measuring @xmath3 by cavity state tomography , observing quantum collapses and revivals and confirming the non - classical properties of the transient states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the zeros of this phase - space probability have been shown as an indicator of the regular or chaotic behavior in quantum maps , theoretically , in a a variety of quantum problems such as molecular systems @xcite , atomic physics @xcite , quantum billiards @xcite or in condensed matter physics @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) , and experimentally @xcite in the kicked top . </S>",
    "<S> they have also been considered as an indicator of metal - insulator phase transitions @xcite and quantum phase transitions in the dicke , vibron and lmg models @xcite . additionally , in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the eigenfunctions of the lmg hamiltonian were analyzed in terms of the zeros of the majorana polynomial ( proportional to the husimi amplitude ) , leading to exact expressions for the density of states in the thermodynamic , mean field , limit .    </S>",
    "<S> all these examples support the important operational and physical meaning of the @xmath3 zeros and its experimental accessibility .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we establish an exact correspondence between the zeros of the phase - space probability distribution @xmath3 and the pairing energies of the lmg model . as a byproduct , </S>",
    "<S> a reconstruction of the wave function in terms of the zeros of @xmath3 is also provided . besides , an analysis of the pairing energies degeneracy is done in terms of the zeros multiplicity . finally , we show that the link between pairing energies and zeros of the phase - space probability distribution @xmath3 can be generalized to other pairing models like , for example , the bosonic bcs mean - field like model .    _ pairing hamiltonians and the lmg model_.- </S>",
    "<S> many models describing pairing correlations in condensed matter and nuclear physics are defined by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) creates ( destroys ) a fermion in the @xmath7 state of the @xmath8 level with energy @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the states @xmath10 and @xmath11 are usually taken to be the conjugate ( time - reversed ) of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , but other possibilities can also be considered @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing hamiltonian can be mapped onto a nonlinear spin system in terms of anderson pseudospin operators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for some particular choices of @xmath14 and couplings @xmath15 , the hamiltonian can be written in terms of the @xmath16 quasispin collective operators @xmath17 this is the case of the lmg model , which assumes that the nucleus is a system of fermions which can occupy two levels @xmath8 with the same degeneracy ( @xmath18 ) , separated by an energy @xmath19 . in the quasispin formalism , the lmg model hamiltonian is @xcite : @xmath20 the @xmath21 term annihilates pairs of particles in one level and creates pairs in the other level and the @xmath15 term scatters one particle up while another is scattered down . </S>",
    "<S> the total angular momentum @xmath22 and the total number of particles @xmath23 are conserved . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry reduces the size of the largest matrix to be diagonalized from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . for a dicke state @xmath26 , </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalue @xmath27 of @xmath28 gives the number @xmath29 of excited particle - hole pairs . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 also commutes with the parity operator @xmath31 , so that temporal evolution does not connect states with different parity </S>",
    "<S> . it will be useful for us to make use of the boson ( schwinger ) realization of the @xmath16 operators in terms of two bosons @xmath32 and @xmath33 : @xmath34 and the dicke states @xmath26 in terms of fock states @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the occupancy number of levels @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ exact solvability of the lmg model_.- making use of the previous schwinger realization , the lmg model has been proved to be exactly solvable by mapping it to a @xmath38 richardson - gaudin integrable model @xcite . introducing the new parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 and using @xmath41 , the unnormalized eigenvectors of the lmg hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> are found to be @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the so - called spectral parameters or _ pairing energies _ , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the seniorities . for integer @xmath46 , </S>",
    "<S> the seniorities are equal to @xmath47 or @xmath48 , and the total number of pairs is @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath50 pairing energies @xmath51 can be determined by solving a coupled set of richardson ( nonlinear ) equations @xcite and the eigenvalues of the lmg hamiltonian are given in terms of pairing energies .    </S>",
    "<S> _ phase - space probability distribution and correspondence between its zeros and pairing energies_.- given a general state @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the total occupancy number , the so - called husimi distribution @xmath1 is defined as the squared modulus of the overlap @xmath54 between @xmath55 and an arbitrary spin-@xmath46 coherent state @xmath56 where @xmath57 is given in terms of the polar @xmath58 and azimuthal @xmath59 angles on the riemann sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this phase - space probability distribution function is non - negative and normalized according to @xmath60 ( for normalized @xmath0 ) , with integration measure ( the solid angle ) @xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> taking into account that @xmath62 ( and a similar equation for @xmath33 ) , after a little bit of algebra we can calculate the husimi amplitude of the eigenvector in terms of the pairing energies @xmath51 as @xmath63 [ @xmath64 denotes complex conjugate ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the zeros of this phase - space representation of the quantum state @xmath0 can be analytically related with the pairing energies by the equation : @xmath65 this is the main result of this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> as already said , it is known that one can represent each quantum state @xmath0 by means of the zeros of its phase - space representation @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we have also found an explicit expression of the hamiltonian eigenstates in terms of the zeros of their phase - space representation @xmath3 when plugging @xmath66 in eq . .    </S>",
    "<S> for a general state @xmath67 , the @xmath3 amplitude has the form @xmath68 which is proportional to the so - called majorana polynomial @xcite , @xmath69 , in the variable @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this polynomial and its zeros have been used in @xcite to find the energy spectra and density of states of the lmg hamiltonian in the thermodynamic @xmath71 limit , as well as first order finite size corrections . here </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the exact solvability of the lmg model ( by mapping it to a @xmath38 richardson - gaudin integrable model @xcite ) and achieve exact solutions for finite @xmath72-size , by establishing a connection between the pairing energies @xmath73 and the zeros of the husimi function of the eigenstates of the lmg model . </S>",
    "<S> finite zeros of @xmath1 are then calculated by solving the @xmath18-degree majorana polynomial equation @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> besides , we have an extra zero of @xmath75 at @xmath76 ( @xmath77 : south pole ) when @xmath78 ( in particular , when @xmath0 belongs to the odd parity sector with @xmath79 ) . in total , the @xmath3 amplitude @xmath75 has @xmath18 zeros counted with their multiplicity . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath80 yield the same @xmath73 for @xmath81 , then one always has @xmath82 zeros attached to @xmath83 pairing energies . for @xmath79 , </S>",
    "<S> the extra @xmath84 zeros are @xmath85 and @xmath76 , as can be seen from eq . . </S>",
    "<S> all these values determine the eigenfunction of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done for any eigenstate of the hamiltonian , that is finding the corresponding zeros of the husimi function .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , as an example , we have computed numerically the coefficients @xmath86 of the ground state of the lmg hamiltonian , and the corresponding zeros of @xmath3 , for the trajectory @xmath87 in the control parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> figure ( [ figpairons ] ) shows pairing energies @xmath73 ( first and second panels ) and zeros @xmath88 of the @xmath3 function ( third and fourth panels ) for the ground state and the trajectory @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted the range @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> this figure shows a clear example of the mapping between the pairing energies @xmath51 and the zeros @xmath90 of @xmath1 .     </S>",

    "<S> [ figpairons ] ) for certain values of the parameter @xmath93 of the lmg hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> these collapses or places where several zeros of the husimi function or pairing energies join are determined by the expression @xmath94 for the trajectory @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is obtained at the intersections between the straigthline @xmath95 and the family of hyperbolas @xmath96 ^ 2 $ ] with @xmath97 . notice that the point @xmath93 given in ( [ new1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> must be real and then it exists if @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the symbol @xmath99 means the smallest integer part of @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> this family of points @xmath101 has the property that each element verifies that the ground state amplitude of the husimi function , @xmath102 , has @xmath103 different zeros , one of them of multiplicity @xmath104 and the others @xmath105 of multiplicity @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore when the path @xmath87 , crosses each point of the above family , the zeros of the ground state @xmath3 function join with the aforementioned multiplicity . </S>",
    "<S> we want to stress that due to the relation given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ relacion ] ) the same behavior is displayed by the pairing energies . </S>",
    "<S> for the trajectory @xmath107 with @xmath108 , one verifies that the ground state husimi function has only one zero ( the north pole in the riemann sphere ) of multiplicity @xmath18 , so that all the zeros of the @xmath3 function ( and thus all the pairing energies ) join at the point @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients appearing in the family of hyperbolas , that is @xmath110 , define the @xmath93 values where there are crossings between the even and odd energy levels , when one takes @xmath107 ( these points are explicitly calculated in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the physical interpretation of the pairons collapses , there are several analysis in the literature , for example in the context of the su(2 ) richardson - gaudin exact solution of a gas of spinless fermions  @xcite . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> pairons collapses are representing bound pairs because the pairons are real and negative . in our case , as it can be seen in figure [ figpairons ] , all the particles form bound pairs at the point @xmath111 , while at the right- and left - hand sides of @xmath111 the number of bound pairs decreases and the number of dispersion states increases . notice that for @xmath112 all the cooper pairs are deconfined ( in the sense of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> _ experimental setups for state reconstruction and the determination of zeros and pairing energies_.- concerning the physical meaning and the experimental determination of the zeros of @xmath1 for a spin system like lmg , let us discuss two possible experimental setups . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is related to the fact that the coherent state @xmath113 is the rotation of @xmath114 about the axis @xmath115 in the @xmath100-@xmath116 plane by an angle @xmath58 , that is @xmath117 . a possible procedure for quantum - state reconstruction </S>",
    "<S> is explained in references @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> basically , the phase - space distribution @xmath118 is precisely the probability to measure @xmath119 in @xmath0 , which can be determined by means of , for example , a stern - gerlach apparatus oriented along @xmath120 ( see e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . repeting this procedure ( with a large number of identically prepared systems ) for a finite number of orientations @xmath121 , one can determine the function @xmath1 and , therefore , its zeros . actually , the zeros @xmath122 of @xmath1 are just those orientations @xmath123 of the stern - gerlach apparatus for which the probability of the outcome @xmath119 vanishes . simulations of the lmg model in a bose - einstein condensate in a double - well potential are known ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this context , the polar angle @xmath58 is related to the population imbalance @xmath124 ( the mean value of @xmath28 ) , and the azimuthal angle @xmath59 is the relative phase of the two spatially separated bose - einstein condensates . </S>",
    "<S> both quantities can be determined in terms of matter wave interference experiments as is shown in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    therefore , the reconstruction of any state @xmath55 and the possibility to measure pairing energies in terms of the zeros of @xmath1 are then experimentally accessible .    </S>",
    "<S> _ extension to other bosonic bcs - like models_.- the correspondence between pairing energies and zeros of the probability distribution representing a state in phase space is also present in other higher - dimensional bcs models , although the relation is a little bit more subtle . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider for example the bosonic counterpart of , where @xmath6 are now boson @xmath125 annihilation operators . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider @xmath126 scalar bosons @xmath127 . in the case of uniform couplings </S>",
    "<S> @xmath128 , the complete set of eigenstates of this model is given by @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a state of @xmath131 unpaired bosons and @xmath132 are the seniorities . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of particles is @xmath133 , with @xmath50 the number of paired bosons . </S>",
    "<S> as for the lmg model , each eigenstate @xmath134 is completely determined by a set of @xmath50 pairing energies @xmath73 ( which are solutions of a set of coupled non - linear richardson s equations @xcite ) and their energies are given by @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 probability distribution of any quantum state @xmath0 for this model is the squared modulus of the overlap between @xmath55 and a general @xmath136 coherent state @xmath137 which is a generalization of for @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 amplitude of an eigenstate turns out to be @xmath139 therefore , the zeros @xmath140 of @xmath141 lie now on @xmath142-dimensional complex ellipsoids @xmath143 with semi - principal axes of complex `` length '' @xmath144 . still , there is a correspondence between pairing energies and complex ellipsoids in phase space , where the @xmath3 distribution vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the occurrence ( or absence ) of @xmath145 as a zero of means seniority @xmath146 ( or @xmath147 ) .    _ conclusions_.- exploiting the exact solvability of the lmg model ( as a particular case of @xmath38 richardson - gaudin integrable model ) , we have revealed an interesting relation between pairing energies and zeros of a phase space probability distribution representing the quantum state in finite - size pairing mean - field like models . </S>",
    "<S> zeros are experimentally accessible and this gives a method to find pairing energies multiplicities across the control parameter space . as a byproduct , knowing the zeros , one can reconstruct the corresponding state . </S>",
    "<S> these results are proven to be valid for a large class of paring systems and , in principle , they could be extended to other systems where particles pairs emerge . </S>"
