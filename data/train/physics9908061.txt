    "wave packet dynamics has exposed interesting new phenomena in several fields . in femto - chemistry @xcite",
    "we are now able to time - resolve chemical processes and also observe effects such as the breakup and revival of wave packets @xcite . in atom optics wave packets are used to model matter waves @xcite , and electron wave packets are seen in the dynamics of rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "the numerical modelling of wave packet dynamics has been achieved by a number of methods @xcite , but one of the earliest approaches was by heller @xcite who simply used the ansatz of a time dependent gaussian wave packet .",
    "this gaussian approach is very useful , but it is usually an approximation and can be quite wrong , for example at turning points .",
    "several improvements have been made : for example , the method of generalised gaussian wave packets @xcite used complex classical trajectories for gaussian wave packets , and the hybrid method @xcite used an expansion in terms of a grid of gaussian wave packets .",
    "the idea of using a time dependent harmonic ( i.e.  gauss - hermite ) basis , in the context of wave packet propagation , was put forward by lee and heller @xcite and coalson and karplus @xcite .",
    "the basis was chosen so that the lowest eigenstate matches the heller gaussian wave packet , but with the inclusion of a complete set of basis states the modelling can be performed accurately .",
    "this approach was generalised to multi - dimensional systems by lee @xcite .",
    "however , several possibilities for using a gauss - hermite basis exist : parameters for the dynamic basis were treated in a variational method by kay @xcite and by kucar and meyer @xcite , more recently the phase space picture was explored by mller and henriksen @xcite , and the use of a gauss - hermite basis with a variational treatment has been expanded by billing @xcite to examine non - adiabatic transitions and corrections to classical path equations .",
    "the approach that is used in this paper is similar , in principle , to the time dependent gauss - hermite basis of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ; in each case the basis follows the heller gaussian wave packet .",
    "however , the focus here is on the evolution operator and transformations associated with the time - dependent basis which becomes both `` displaced '' and `` squeezed '' .",
    "that is , unlike previous extensions to gaussian wave packet dynamics , the system hamiltonian is transformed by displacement and squeezing in a way that removes _ all _ operator dependence which is quadratic or less .",
    "the result is an evolution equation which depends on a time dependent ` residual potential ' which is based on the original ( one - dimensional ) potential with harmonic terms removed .",
    "this means that if the higher order derivatives of the potential are small , the system evolution will change relatively slowly , which allows a rapid numerical integration ( of a set of ordinary differential equations ) .",
    "the method , which is in principle exact , is then similar to a time - dependent perturbation theory in a time dependent basis or interaction picture .",
    "indeed , it can be developed as a perturbation theory in the higher order derivatives of the system potential about the classical motion .",
    "because the evolution operator is found , the possibility exists for applying this extended gaussian wave packet method to initial states that are not gaussian .",
    "the evolution operator also allows us to use the displacement and squeezing transformations to find explicit matrix elements of the residual potential using standard operator algebra .",
    "in section  [ sdisp ] of this paper we set up the problem and perform a basis shift according to the classical dynamics .",
    "section  [ sgauss ] examines gaussian wave packet dynamics in this displaced basis , and in the original basis by two different approaches .",
    "the relationship between the two approaches is established . in section  [ ssqu ]",
    "we establish the squeezing transformation necessary to map the time evolution of a gaussian wave packet from its initial state . by using the same transformation for another change of basis we can find the equations for corrections to gaussian wave packet dynamics .",
    "these equations are expressed in a fock basis in section  [ sfock ] , where we also compare our results to the gauss - hermite basis .",
    "some examples of useful matrix elements for potentials are given in section  [ sresidual ] , and in section  [ sapplied ] the results are applied to several different problems .",
    "the problem we wish to describe is the one dimensional problem of a wave packet in a potential described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 the position and momentum co - ordinates have been denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 to distinguish them from scaled quantities that will shortly be introduced .",
    "the initial wave packet will be taken to be a gaussian one .",
    "this is not essential , but it will simplify the treatment that will follow .",
    "the key feature is that a length scale , characteristic of the initial wave packet defines the width of the harmonic oscillator basis that we will use . for a gaussian initial wave packet @xmath3   \\ ; ,   \\label{wpinit}\\ ] ] which has a width @xmath4 and is located at @xmath5 with momentum @xmath6 .",

    "the motion of a gaussian wave packet in a harmonic potential is exactly solvable , even when the potential is time dependent , and we will use this to define the local basis for the wave packet .",
    "that is , the potential function @xmath17 will be expanded to second order about the the position of the wave packet .",
    "the dynamics of a gaussian wave packet in this harmonic potential will be determined , and these dynamics will be used to define the basis for the full ( non - gaussian ) wave packet dynamics .",
    "the wave packet ( [ wpsinit ] ) is located at the position @xmath15 , which will in general be time dependent ; we then take its location to be given by @xmath18 .",
    "if we expand the potential about this point we obtain , @xmath19 where the spatial derivatives are indicated with the primes .",
    "the terms in the expansion are not explicitly time dependent ; they vary only with time through the position @xmath18 .",
    "the potential function @xmath20 is the residual potential found after making the harmonic expansion .",
    "that is , it contains the higher order , cubic and above , terms in the expansion .",

    "a numerical split operator fft method was found to be roughly a thousand times slower than the xgwp method .",
    "finally , we should note that while the idea of the gauss - hermite basis has been exploited by a number of authors , in different ways , the emphasis in this paper has been on the transformations involved .",
    "only 1d results have been presented , and it is not clear if the method extends easily to more degrees of freedom .",
