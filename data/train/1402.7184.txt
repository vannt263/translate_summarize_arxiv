    "recent years have seen an explosion in both the amount of data available to scientists of all persuasions and the computing power necessary to run simulations of mathematical models .",
    "there is a rapidly expanding vista for the application of mathematics to the life and social sciences .",
    "one major theme of this effort is _ emergence _ , the name given to the idea that patterns in the collective behaviour of large groups of interacting agents may be explicable even if each individual is assumed to obey only rules which are both simple and _ local _ , the latter meaning that each agent is only influenced by its close neighbours , in some appropriate metric .",
    "this idea is mathematically appealing , as it suggests a preference for deducing interesting theorems from simple hypotheses .",
    "hence , even if the relevance of any particular mathematical model to `` reality '' may be a difficult and controversial issue , there is at least the promise of some beautiful new mathematical results and conjectures resulting from these efforts .",
    "the field of _ opinion dynamics _ is concerned with how human agents modify their opinions on social issues as a result of the influence of others .",
    "this paper is a contribution to the study of a particularly elegant and well - known mathematical model , the bounded confidence model of hegselmann and krause @xcite , or simply the _ hk - model _ for brevity . in the simplest formulation of the model",
    ", we have a finite number , say @xmath0 , of agents , indexed by the integers @xmath1 .",
    "the opinion of agent @xmath2 is represented by a real number @xmath3 , where the convention is that @xmath4 whenever @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamics are as follows : there is a fixed parameter @xmath6 such that , after each unit of time , every individual replaces their current opinion by the average of those which currently lie within distance @xmath7 of themselves .",
    "this is summarised by the formula @xmath8 where @xmath9 . as the dynamics is obviously unaffected by rescaling all opinions and the confidence bound @xmath7 by a common factor",
    ", we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath10 .",
    "note that the hk - model seems to implicitly assume that each agent is aware of the opinions of all other agents , even if he chooses to ignore most of them when modifying his view .",
    "hence the agents do not really obey `` local '' rules in the sense described earlier . in one sense",
    ", this is a matter of interpretation .",
    "for example , a conservatively inclined uk citizen may switch the channel whenever a member of the labour party is giving an interview , or my keep watching but shake his head and mutter under his breath .",
    "in other words , the agent adopts strategies which both filter out unwelcome opinions and prevent him from being aware of them in the first place . on the other hand",
    ", the hk - model clearly assumes that an agent is aware of all opinions within his current confidence range .",
    "there are no restrictions imposed by , for example , geography , which prevent certain agents from sharing opinions a priori .",
    "other important features of the model are that it is fully deterministic and that all agents act simultaneously .",
    "hence the model differs in important respects from other famous models of opinion dynamics such as classical voter models @xcite or the deffuant - weisbuch model @xcite .",
    "the update rule ( [ eq : update ] ) is certainly simple to formulate , though the simplicity is deceptive .",
    "associated to a given configuration @xmath11 of opinions is a _ receptivity graph _ @xmath12 , whose nodes are the @xmath0 agents and where an edge is placed between agents @xmath2 and @xmath13 whenever @xmath14 . the transition in the configuration from time @xmath15 to time @xmath16",
    "is determined by this graph at time @xmath15",
    ". however , it is clear from ( [ eq : update ] ) that the graph will in general vary with time . in algebraic terms , the dynamics are governed by a time - dependent stochastic matrix . this time dependence is the basic reason why many beautiful conjectures about the hk - model remain unresolved , as we shall now explain .",
    "+    we begin with the necessary notation and terminology .",
    "the state space for a system of @xmath0 agents obeying the hk - dynamics is the set of non - decreasing functions @xmath17 , equivalently , the set of vectors @xmath18 such that @xmath4 whenever @xmath5 .",
    "an _ equilibrium _",
    "state is one such that @xmath19 whenever @xmath20 . clearly , once an equilibrium state is reached , then the opinion of every agent will be frozen for all future time .",
    "it is also easy to see that the converse holds : if @xmath21 for all @xmath2 , then @xmath22 must be an equilibrium state .",
    "any set of agents sharing a common opinion are referred to as a _",
    "cluster_. by a slight abuse of terminology , the term `` cluster '' may refer either to the set of agents with a certain opinion or the real number representing that opinion .",
    "hence , a hk - system is in equilibrium if and only if no two clusters are within unit distance of each other .",
    "the simplest kind of equilibrium state is a _",
    "consensus _ ,",
    "in which there is only one cluster . given a cluster @xmath23 ,",
    "its weight @xmath24 is the number of agents sharing opinion @xmath25 .",
    "a _ stable equilibrium _",
    "is one in which , for any two clusters @xmath26 and @xmath27 , latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : stable }    this last notion was introduced in @xcite , which is the paper that directly inspired the present work .",
    "the two fundamental facts about the hk - model are the following : +   + ( a ) any initial state will evolve to equilibrium within a finite time .",
    "+ ( b ) even if the receptivity graph is initially connected , the subsequent equilibrium state need not be a consensus . +    fact ( a ) seems to have been rediscovered several times over and there are a number of different proofs in the literature .",
    "indeed , the same fact has been proven for a wide class of models of which hk is just one particularly simple example , see @xcite .",
    "some of the known proofs of ( a ) give effective bounds for the time taken to reach equilibrium , as a function of the number @xmath0 of agents only .",
    "the best - known bound is @xmath29 , which was proven independently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is speculated , however , that equilibrium is always reached within @xmath30 steps , and that the worst - case scenario is given by the initial state , the initial state @xmath31 reaches equilibrium in about @xmath32 steps , where @xmath25 is a constant slightly greater than @xmath33 . ]",
    "this is an important open problem in the field .    regarding ( b )",
    ", it is easy to see that consensus may not be achieved if the initial distribution of opinions is very uneven .",
    "for example , suppose we have @xmath35 agents and the initial state is @xmath36 at @xmath37 , the opinion of agent 99 will be pulled very close to @xmath38 , while agent 100 will only modify his opinion to @xmath39 . thus , agent 100 will now be isolated from everyone else and will form a cluster by himself in the equilibrium configuration .",
    "what is more interesting is that consensus may not emerge even when there is no such unevenness in the initial configuration .",
    "the simplest example is the initial state @xmath40 .",
    "a direct computation shows that the resulting equilibrium consists of clusters at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , each of weight three . at this point",
    "it seems natural to ask what a `` typical '' equilibrium state looks like . in order to make this question precise ,",
    "let us fix a parameter @xmath43 and suppose that the initial opinions @xmath44 are chosen independently and uniformly at random from the interval @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the following two conjectures are supported by overwhelming numerical evidence :    [ conj : critical ] with opinions chosen initially as just described , let @xmath46 denote the probability that the resulting equilibrium is a consensus . then there exists a critical value @xmath47 is close to 5 . ] such that , as @xmath48 , @xmath49 whenever @xmath50 and @xmath51 whenever @xmath52 .",
    "[ conj:2r ] with opinions chosen initially as described above , let @xmath53 denote the probability that the resulting equilibrium is stable , in the sense of ( [ eq : stable ] ) .",
    "then for any fixed @xmath43 , @xmath54 as @xmath48 .",
    "we have not seen conjecture [ conj : critical ] stated explicitly anywhere , though it is implicit in the statements of many different authors .",
    "conjecture [ conj:2r ] is a special case of conjecture 1 in @xcite .",
    "they conjecture that the equilibrium state is almost surely stable under the weaker assumption that the initial opinions are chosen independently from any continuous and bounded pdf on @xmath45 $ ] with connected support , and not just the uniform distribution .",
    "indeed , it is expected that , when the initial distribution is uniform , then the clusters at equilibrium will typically have about the same weight and hence , if ( [ eq : stable ] ) holds , will typically be separated by at least two .",
    "this hypothesis is referred to in the literature as the _",
    "@xmath55 conjecture_. we are not aware of anyone having turned this hypothesis into a precise conjecture , however .",
    "the reason for this is probably that , at least as far as can be told from simulations to date , the distribution of cluster sizes arising from a uniform initial distribution of opinions appears to be quite subtle .    in an attempt to better understand the behaviour of the hk - model for a large number of agents , blondel , hendrickx and tsitsiklis introduced @xcite a _ continuous agent _ version of the model . here",
    "the uncountably many agents are indexed by numbers in the closed interval @xmath56 $ ] and the state space consists of non - decreasing , bounded functions @xmath57 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}$ ] .",
    "the analogue of ( [ eq : update ] ) is @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denotes lebesgue measure .",
    "of course , for ( [ eq : contupdate ] ) to even make sense we must assume that the state space contains only lebesgue measurable functions . an _ equilibrium state _ in this setting is a function attaining only finitely many values , such that the difference between any two such values exceeds one whenever both are attained on sets of positive measure .",
    "stable equilibrium can be defined as in ( [ eq : stable ] ) , where now @xmath61 , and the inequality is required to hold whenever both clusters have positive weight . in particular , consensus means a constant function , whereas any equilibrium state which is not a consensus is represented by a discontinuous function .",
    "it is natural to assume that the initial state @xmath62 is continuous , however .",
    "intuitively , @xmath63 should be injective and @xmath64 should correspond to the cdf in conjecture [ conj:2r ] .",
    "this suggests restricting attention to initial states which are @xmath65 . on the other hand",
    ", there are simple examples where @xmath66 but @xmath67 has corners . for example , suppose @xmath68 .",
    "an easy computation yields @xmath69 hence @xmath67 is not differentiable at @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we shall assume henceforth that the initial state is _ regular _ , by which we mean that it is almost everywhere @xmath65 , with strictly positive lower and upper bounds on its derivative where it ex1ists .",
    "this is a slight strengthening of the notion of regularity as defined in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the discrete case , it is not clear whether any initial state will reach equilibrium in finite time . indeed , since any continuous function will obviously remain so when updated according to ( [ eq : contupdate ] ) , no regular initial state can reach a non - consensus equilibrium in finite time . in @xcite ,",
    "it is conjectured that a regular initial state @xmath62 will converge almost everywhere to a stable equilibrium , that is : there is a stable equilibrium @xmath72 such that , for each @xmath73 there is a @xmath74 such that @xmath75 for all @xmath76 .",
    "they prove a weaker statement in @xcite , but this fundamental conjecture about the continuous agent model remains open .",
    "note , however , that hendrickx and olshevsky have recently @xcite proven a corresponding conjecture for another variation on the model where time is also treated as continuous .    thus ,",
    "for the continuous agent model , a regular initial state will reach equilibrium in finite time if and only if that equilibrium is a consensus  more precisely , @xmath77 will be constant if and only if @xmath78 .",
    "this brings us to perhaps the most curious aspect of the continuous agent model , namely it is not obvious that there is any regular initial state which does not reach consensus .",
    "the existence of such states was conjectured in @xcite , but they could give no example with proof .",
    "more precisely , conjecture 3 of @xcite postulates the existence of a regular @xmath62 such that @xmath79 the motivation for this restriction is that they could prove that , if ( [ eq : overtwo ] ) holds , then @xmath22 is regular for all @xmath15 . our contribution here will be to prove this conjecture :    [ theorem : main ] there exists a regular function @xmath80 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}$ ] such that , if the sequence @xmath81 is defined according to ( [ eq : contupdate ] ) , then @xmath82 for all @xmath15 .",
    "section [ sect : proof ] contains a proof of this result and section [ sect : discuss ] contains a discussion of some open problems .",
    "the opinion function to be described below will converge pointwise to a non - regular stable state with 3 clusters of positive weight , and the construction can be extended to allow convergence to ( at least ) any odd number of such clusters .",
    "let @xmath83 $ ] . to construct our initial state @xmath62 , we first partition the set @xmath84 into closed intervals @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , each overlapping the next in exactly one point . for a small @xmath90 that will be specified later , we also require @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes the length of an interval , so that the endpoints of the intervals lie symmetrically around the centre @xmath94 of @xmath87 . we also define @xmath95 $ ] , @xmath96 $ ] and @xmath97 $ ] for some @xmath98 to be subsets of the opinion space .",
    "how small @xmath90 needs to be will depend , among other things , on the choice of @xmath99 , so to save us some bookkeeping , we will fix @xmath100 .",
    "these sets are fixed and do not depend on time .",
    "there is some freedom in the construction of the initial state , and in some places conditions will be given along with an example .",
    "we will often present an example without explicit bounds on how much it can be varied .",
    "first of all , the initial opinion function @xmath62 is defined to be anti - symmetric about @xmath25 . by this",
    "is meant that if coordinates were to be chosen so that @xmath101 and @xmath102 , then @xmath62 would be odd . from this symmetry",
    ", it easily follows that @xmath103 for all time steps @xmath15 , and that the anti - symmetry remains .",
    "second , @xmath62 is defined so that @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "this will give @xmath62 the shape of a `` double s '' , with a small plateau in the middle and two long tails , see figure [ skurva ] .",
    "not only should @xmath62 stay within these `` boxes '' , illustrated in figure [ box1 ] , but we require also that the derivative fulfil that @xmath107 and @xmath108 for suitable constants @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in this example , we will take @xmath62 to be linear on all intervals @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and @xmath109 and @xmath110 to equal the derivatives on @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , so that @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "lador2gimpad(0.53 )    to prove that , from the initial state @xmath62 , condition ( [ eq : overtwo ] ) will be satisfied , a sort of induction will be used . for every time step ,",
    "the average opinion for the agents in @xmath85 will increase , and we will prove that this increase is at most linear in the measure of the set of agents with opinion in a certain subset of @xmath113 .",
    "we will then show that this measure will shrink quickly enough for the sum of the increments in @xmath85 to converge , and thereby show that there will always be agents in @xmath85 with opinion less than @xmath90 , provided @xmath90 is chosen small enough .",
    "because of symmetry , this will imply the existence of agents in @xmath89 with opinions greater than @xmath114 , and since @xmath115 this will complete the proof .",

    "the reason for using @xmath120 instead of just @xmath90 will become clear in the proof of lemma [ lem : vxder ] below . we also let @xmath121 .",
    "we will let @xmath122 denote the average opinion on @xmath123 at time @xmath15 , and a vertical bar with a subscript will denote the restriction of a function to the set in the subscript .    the precise assumptions on the function at time @xmath15 are the following :    i : :    @xmath124 .",

    "the last assumption to hold @xmath90 must be small enough , and it is easy to check that @xmath133 is enough at @xmath132 .    under these assumptions",
    "we will prove the following lemmas :    [ lem : nstab ] only the agents who at time @xmath15 have opinions in @xmath134 may end up in @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "an immediate consequence of this is that @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
