    "the important result is due to the fact that in the vicinity of a dynamical instability the high - dimensional set of nonlinear evolution equations modelling a complex system on a microscopic or a mesoscopic scale can be approximately reduced to a low - dimensional set of order parameter equations describing the evolving pattern formation on a macroscopic scale . to obtain such a simplified , reduced description of selforganization processes , the synergetic system analysis proceeds as follows .",

    "taking into account the infinite - dimensional character of a delay system @xcite , the adiabatic elimination of the stable modes leads to a low - dimensional set of order parameter equations which turn out to be of the form of ordinary differential equations , i.e. they no longer contain memory effects .",
