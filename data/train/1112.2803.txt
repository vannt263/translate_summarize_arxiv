    "<S> for creation of a noisy non - stationary spectrometer working in the subthz frequency range the power and spectral characteristics of a flux flow oscillator ( ffo ) , based on a long josephson junction are studied . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of various bias current profiles on the spectral linewidth of long overlap josephson junction are investigated and comparison with the inline junction geometry is outlined . </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated that the spectral linewidth can be increased by a factor of three with the moderate reduction of emitted power .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords_:josephson flux flow oscillator , noise , linewidth , unbiased tail    at the present time for many applications including ecology and atmosphere monitoring , hi - tech and safety systems , medicine and biology , the problem of the precise analysis of multicomponent gas composites is important . for a wide variety of problems , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to perform the detection of microconcentrations of several gases simultaneously that imposes the strong requirement of sensitivity and speed of a spectrometer operation . </S>",
    "<S> new method of nonstationary microwave spectroscopy based on noise sources of radiation allows to realize high sensitivity , high resolution and possibility of wide range measurements simultaneously@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the josephson flux flow oscillator@xcite ( ffo ) based on a long nb - alox - nb josephson junction , generating the broadband signal , is a good candidate to be a radiation source for creation of a noisy spectrometer . besides this </S>",
    "<S> , it is very important to have a good noisy source for calibration of mixers , such as based on sis ( superconductor - insulator - superconductor ) josephson junctions , and for calibration of superconductive integrated receiver ( sir ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the ffo @xcite possesses a number of benefits in comparison with other oscillators of microwave range , such as compactness , small power consumption and possibility to work in subthz and thz ranges of frequencies where the most intensive lines of absorption of many substances lie . </S>",
    "<S> since the use of a quasi - chaotic oscillation regime of the ffo @xcite seems to be not suitable for practical applications , first of all due to expected small radiation power @xcite , it is very important to achieve large enough spectral linewidth and radiation power in the range of 450 - 700 ghz , where continuous frequency tuning is possible . besides </S>",
    "<S> , it has been demonstrated recently that if the power spectrum of a noisy signal has the lorentzian shape , then the spectroscopy can be performed in a similar manner as for coherent signals @xcite . while the ffo has perfectly lorentzian spectral line @xcite , its linewidth is restricted by 1 - 50 mhz in 450 - 700 ghz working range , which is not enough for variety of applications . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present paper is to study the possibility to increase the ffo linewidth without serious degradation of its radiation power , by variation of biasing electrodes configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that all basic properties of the ffo can be described in the frame of the sine - gordon equation : @xmath0 where indices @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote temporal and spatial derivatives , @xmath3 is the phase order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> space and time are normalized to the josephson penetration length @xmath4 and to the inverse plasma frequency @xmath5 , respectively , @xmath6 is the damping parameter , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the critical current , @xmath10 is the josephson tunnel junction ( jtj ) capacitance , @xmath11 is the normal state resistance , @xmath12 is the surface loss parameter , @xmath13 is the dc overlap bias current density , normalized to the critical current density @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the fluctuational current density . if the critical current density is fixed and the fluctuations are treated as white gaussian noise with zero mean , its correlation function is : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the dimensionless noise intensity , @xmath18 is the thermal current , @xmath19 is the electron charge , @xmath20 is the planck constant , @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath22 is the temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions , that simulate simple rc - loads , see ref.s @xcite , have the form : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the normalized magnetic field , and @xmath25 is the dimensionless length of the ffo in units of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless capacitances and resistances , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are the ffo rc - load placed at the left ( output ) and at the right ( input ) ends , respectively .    in general , there are two possible ways to increase the radiation linewidth of the ffo at flux flow steps ( i.e. in the frequency range 450 - 700 ghz ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest way is mixing either the bias current or the magnetic field with low - frequency noise . </S>",
    "<S> however , the lorentzian shape of spectral line then will be transformed into the gaussian one . </S>",
    "<S> another way is to adjust the bias current profile in an optimal fashion . </S>",
    "<S> namely this second way is the subject of the present paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution @xmath28 of the bias current is determined by the configuration of the biasing electrodes used for current supply . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest case of uniform distribution ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ix1 ] , thin solid line ) is achieved by the equality of the biasing electrode length to the junction length . however , this is an ideal case : obtaining a uniform profile in practice requires additional tricks , such as a normal metal insertions since the current in the superconducting electrode increases with approaching the boundaries of the electrode . </S>",
    "<S> if the electrode is narrower than the josephson junction , the current decreases away from the electrode edge ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ix1 ] , curves with symbols ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> one says that the jtj has the so - called `` unbiased tail '' . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the biasing electrode is described by two points @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 , which defines the left and the right boundaries , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> current profile can be divided into three parts . </S>",
    "<S> the central part corresponding to the current along the electrode is accepted for simplicity to be uniform @xmath32 . in the unbiased regions @xmath33 the decay of the current profile </S>",
    "<S> is assumed to be exponential with @xmath34 law , where @xmath35 is the decay factor . if the current electrode is extremely narrow and shifted to one of the junction edges , the current profile has a decaying part only ( fig . [ ix1 ] , curve with crosses and curve with circles ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the computer simulations are performed with the following parameters : junction length @xmath36 , external magnetic field @xmath37 , parameters of losses @xmath38 and @xmath39 , noise intensity @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , decay factor @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> first , let us consider a situation where the width of the current electrode is smaller than the length of the josephson junction . </S>",
    "<S> let us move the electrode along the junction from position with @xmath45 to position with @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the electrode position the obtained current profile has one of the forms shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ix1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> bias current profiles , shifted from the center of the junction to the input ( right ) edge are shown as dashed .    the current - voltage curves ( ivc ) are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cv1 ] ( the notations are the same as in fig . [ ix1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the farther from the radiating junction edge electrode is moved , the less steep the iv characteristic is .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectral linewidths for different current profiles from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ix1 ] are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ df1 ] . as one can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ df1 ] , for total bias current @xmath47 the linewidth of a nonuniform current profiles is significantly larger than the linewidth of a uniform profile , while for shorter unbiased tail one can get a reduction of the linewidth , see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the current electrode is located near the left edge of the junction ( @xmath48 ) , it can get a line broadening factor of about 2 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ df1 ] , curve with crosses and curve with triangles ) . when the electrode is near the right edge ( @xmath49 ) , the broadening of the linewidths is even larger ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ df1 ] , dashed curve with squares and dashed curve with circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp increasing of the line in 5 - 7 times for these curves ( @xmath50 ) corresponds to the area of low power ( see the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ df1 ] ) and has no interest . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the farther from the radiating edge of the junction electrode is moved , and , consequently , the more flat the voltage - current characteristic is , the broader the spectral line of radiation is obtained ( in accordance with the behavior of differential resistance ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the ffo radiated power is presented in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ df1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the larger the current fed to the output edge of the junction , the greater the power radiated from it . </S>",
    "<S> maximum power is achieved in the case of a narrow electrode shifted to the left edge of the junction . </S>",
    "<S> a high power level for a uniform profile of the bias current can also be noted ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ df1 ] , thin solid curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electrode shifted to the right edge of the junction has an obvious maximum of power and for total bias current @xmath51 the output radiated power is close to the maximum ( dashed curves with squares and circles ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulation of the shift of the narrow current electrode along the josephson junction has led to the following conclusions . to obtain a broad spectral line the bias current profile should be nonuniform , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , the electrode must be more narrow than the junction . </S>",
    "<S> the best result is achieved when the electrode is near the nonradiating junction edge . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this condition allows to receive an acceptable level of radiated power and it is larger than the level for the case of electrode located at the center of the jtj @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the above obtained results , let us consider the dependence of the junction characteristics on the width of the electrode when it is shifted to the right edge ( @xmath52 ) . varying the position of the left boundary of the electrode @xmath53 , the following current profiles shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ix2 ] can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the ivcs are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cv2 ] ( the notations are the same as in fig . [ ix2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from the figure , a narrower current electrode gives a more flat ivc , and in the limit of the electrode width tending to zero ( @xmath54 ) the iv characteristic tends to the ohmic line ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cv2 ] , dotted curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ivc of the uniform current has the largest slope ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cv2 ] , thin solid curve ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectral linewidth versus total bias current is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ df2 ] . similarly to the previous case , the linewidth for the uniform current profile is the smallest one . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the linewidth in the nonuniform case in comparison to the linewidth of a uniform profile ( in the working range of bias current @xmath55 ) is about two times if the electrode is half of the junction @xmath56 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ df2 ] , dashed curve ) , and about three times if @xmath57 in the working range of bias current @xmath58 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ df2 ] , short - dashed curve , dotted curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to obtain a broad spectral line the width of the electrode must be significantly smaller than the junction length .    </S>",
    "<S> the power of the ffo radiation is shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ df2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from the figure , the maximum output power for narrow electrodes @xmath59 is comparable with the radiation power for wide electrode @xmath56 and roughly two times smaller than the maximum power for uniform current distribution case .    </S>",
    "<S> the last case studied in this paper is the dependence of the spectral and power characteristics on the decay factor @xmath35 of the current profile . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ decay ] the ffo linewidth for @xmath54 and different laws of current decay is presented by curves with symbols . as can be seen , for smaller @xmath35 factor </S>",
    "<S> the obtained spectral line is more narrow , while the radiated power is larger ( see the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ decay ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the factor @xmath60 the linewidth ceases to increase and the power almost ceases to fall . in the limit of large @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> the bias current profile turns into a short peak rapidly decreasing away from the junction edge . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare an overlap jtj with the extremely narrow current electrode shifted to the input ( right ) edge with the jtj of the inline geometry . in the inline case </S>",
    "<S> the bias current is injected into the junction parallel to its long direction , which in one - dimensional model leads to injection at the ends of the junction only , so the bias current profile is described by delta functions at the ends of the junction @xcite : @xmath61 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown @xcite that for the inline jtj the linewidth is 2 - 2.5 times larger than for the overlap case of uniform distribution with a small difference in the radiated power . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ decay ] the case of the inline geometry is presented by thin solid curve for comparison with the optimized cases of overlap jtj . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the linewidth for nonuniform bias current distribution with rapid current decay ( curves with crosses and triangles ) is slightly larger than the inline ffo linewidth , while the inline geometry gives significantly larger power ( presumably due to the fact that for the inline case the fluxons are accelerated from both junction ends ) .    in conclusions , the possibility of increasing of the ffo linewidth at the quasimonochromatic generation regime by supplying a nonuniform bias current profile has been studied . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> the output power and spectral characteristics for different current profiles have been computed and compared . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the optimization of the nonuniform current profile allows increasing the linewidth by a factor of three with the moderate power reduction , which opens up new possibilities for solving the task of creation of noisy non - stationary spectrometer based on a long josephson junction . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , for a number of applications a three times increase of the linewidth ( which in practice leads to the maximal linewdith of order 100 - 200 mhz in 450 - 700 ghz frequency range for nb - alox - nb ffos ) may be not enough and here either additional mixing with low frequency noise or transfer to high temperature superconductors can help .    </S>",
