    "many of the most interesting extensions of the general theory of relativity are scalar - tensor theories of gravity .",
    "they incorporate scalar fields which can carry space - time variations in scalar quantities that are traditionally assumed to be constant in general relativity . in this respect",
    "they provide natural arenas in which to explore the consequences of varying constants of nature , like newton s constant @xmath0 , or sommerfeld s fine structure constant , @xmath3 in this paper we shall focus upon the first of these applications , pioneered by jordan @xcite and then refined into the most familiar generalisation of einstein s theory of gravitation by brans and dicke in 1961 , @xcite .",
    "this theory features both in direct explorations of the possible variation of @xmath0 , in dimensional reduction of higher - dimensional theories , and in string theories @xcite , where is appears containing a dilaton with non - minimal coupling .",
    "the original theory of brans - dicke is recognised as the simplest case of a family of scalar - tensor gravity theories in which the original brans - dicke coupling parameter , @xmath4 , becomes a function of the scalar field that carries variations in @xmath0 , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "extensive studies have been made of cosmological solutions of scalar - tensor gravity theories @xcite , although they are limited in two respects .",
    "first , they focus on the simplest case of isotropic expansion with zero spatial curvature , where simple exact solutions exist .",
    "second , they are exclusively concerned with spatially homogeneous cosmologies .",
    "the latter restriction means that the value of @xmath0 and its rate of change in time , @xmath5 are required to be the same everywhere in the universe .",
    "this assumption has run through the entire literature on varying @xmath0 and so it is generally assumed , for example , that local observational bounds on varying @xmath6 derived from geophysics , solar system dynamics , stellar evolution , or white dwarf cooling can be applied directly to constrain cosmological variations in @xmath0 on extragalactic scales or in the very early universe .",
    "there is no justification for this simplifying assumption , as pointed out by barrow and otoole @xcite .",
    "the local bounds on varying @xmath0 are all derived from observations of gravitationally bound lumps which are in gravitational equilibrium and _ do not take part in the expansion of the universe . _",
    "before they can be extrapolated to constrain possible variations of @xmath0 in a background friedmann universe ( as is habitually done in the literature , without justification ) we need to understand how @xmath0 and @xmath2 are expected to vary in space in a realistic inhomogeneous universe . since , even on the scale of a typical galaxy , the amplitude of visible density inhomogeneities are of order @xmath7 , we need to go beyond linear perturbation theory for such an analysis .    in this paper",
    "we begin to confront this deficiency by tracing the evolution of @xmath0 , first in exact inhomogeneous solutions and then a simple , but not unrealistic , inhomogeneous universe in which a zero - curvature brans - dicke - friedmann background universe is populated by spherical overdensities which are modelled by positive curvature brans - dicke - friedmann universes in the dust - dominated era of the universe s history .",
    "this will enable us to track the different evolution followed by @xmath8 in the background universe and in the overdense regions , which eventually separate off from the background universe and start to contract to high - density like separate closed universes .",
    "this process can produce significant differences between @xmath0 and @xmath2 in the background and in the overdensities .",
    "eventually , the collapse of the spherical overdensities will be stopped by pressure and a complicated sequence of dissipative and relaxation processes will lead to virialisation and some final state of gravitational equilibrium .",
    "this state will provide the gravitational environment out of which which stars and planetary systems like our own will form , directly reflecting the local value of @xmath8 inherited from their virialised protogalaxy or its parent protocluster .",
    "the simple model we use for inhomogeneities in density and in @xmath0 has many obvious limitations , notably in its neglect of pressure , deviations from spherical symmetry , accretion , and interactions between inhomogeneities .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that it will be indicative of the importance of taking spatial inhomogeneity into account in any attempts to use observational data to constrain cosmological models which permit varying @xmath0 .",
    "it provides the first step in a clear path towards improved realism in the modelling of inhomogeneities that mirrors the route followed in standard cosmological studies of galaxy formation with constant @xmath0 .    in section [ scalar - tensor cosmology ]",
    "we give the field equations and the field equations for scalar - tensor gravity theories .",
    "to fix ideas , we use some exact brans  dicke ",
    "friedmann cosmological solutions in section analytic to model the time variation of @xmath0 in some new exact inhomogeneous solutions of the field equations which describe a spherical inhomogeneity in an expanding universe . in section [ vaccollapse ]",
    "we use exact solutions of flat and closed vacuum brans  dicke  friedmann cosmologies to illustrate the use of the spherical collapse model for non - linear overdensities .",

    "the behaviour of @xmath0 during the evolution of an overdensity can now be obtained by numerically evolving the background eq .",
    "( [ fried])-([phidot ] ) and the overdensity eqs .",
    "( [ rc ] ) and ( [ phic ] ) until the virial condition ( [ virialcond ] ) holds .",
    "we point out here an inconsistency when one makes use of equation ( virialcond ) together with the assumption that energy is not conserved .",
    "this inconsistency is removed by assuming a negligible outflow of @xmath10 from the overdensity , in which case we regain energy conservation within the system and so retain self - consistency .",
    "the brans  dicke coupling parameter @xmath4 is constant and constrained by a variety of local gravitational tests ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the strongest constraint to date is derived from observations of the shapiro time delay of signals from the cassini space craft as it passes behind the sun .",
    "these considerations led bertotti , iess and tortora @xcite , after a complicated data analysis process , to claim that @xmath4 must have a value greater than @xmath226 ( to @xmath227 ) .",
    "this limit on @xmath4 must be satisfied at all times in all parts of the universe , and leads to the conclusion that brans - dicke theory must be phenomenologically very similar to general relativity throughout most of the history of the universe .",
    "however , we do still expect a cosmological evolution of the brans - dicke field @xmath10 which determines the value of newton s @xmath0 ; and we expect this evolution to be different in regions that collapse to form the structure probed by cassini compared to that in the idealised expanding cosmological background , as described above . hence we expect the measurable value of @xmath0 to be different in these two distinct regions with different histories . it is quite possible that the region of gravitational equilibrium probed by cassini and other local observations would find no perceptible change in @xmath0 locally despite the presence of change on cosmological scales outside of bound inhomogeneities .",
    "in this section we quantify this difference in @xmath0 by numerically evolving @xmath228 , @xmath182 , @xmath10 and @xmath229 until virialisation occurs . at virialisation",
    ", the evolution of @xmath182 and @xmath229 is expected to end , giving a value of @xmath0 that is locally constant in time even though the cosmological evolution of @xmath122 and @xmath10 continues .",
    "the plots in figure [ jbdplot ] were constructed using the representative values @xmath230 and @xmath231 and the boundary condition @xmath232 , so that the value of @xmath0 measured inside the overdensity at present is equal to the value of newton s @xmath0 , as measured locally . the evolution of the background was determined by matching @xmath233 to @xmath10 at the time when the overdensity decouples from the background , @xmath234 .",
    "we see a clear difference in the evolution of @xmath0 in the two regions , as expected .",
    "this example shows that we expect different values of @xmath0 and @xmath116 inside and outside virialised overdensities .",
    "the present value of @xmath0 and @xmath235 depends on the history of the region where it was sampled , as well as on the brans  dicke coupling parameter , @xmath236 .",
    "it can be seen from the plots in figure [ jbdplot ] that increasing @xmath236 has the effect of decreasing the difference in @xmath0 between the background universe and the overdensity .",
    "the size of this inhomogeneity is found to be of order @xmath237 and , correspondingly , reduces to zero as @xmath238 .",
    "this is an important consistency check for the methods used as we expect brans ",
    "dicke theory to reduce to general relativity , with a constant @xmath0 , in this limit .",
    "next , we consider a scalar  tensor theory with a variable @xmath31 .",
    "we investigate the class of theories defined by the choice of coupling function @xmath240 where @xmath142 , @xmath241 , and @xmath26 are positive definite constants .",
    "we refer to this as theory 1 .",
    "such a choice of coupling was considered by barrow and parsons and was solved exactly for the case of a flat frw universe containing a perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "setting the constants as @xmath242 and @xmath243 gives us the scalar  tensor theory considered by damour and pichon damourpichon and by santiago , kalligas and wagoner @xcite .",
    "this choice of @xmath31 corresponds to setting @xmath244 , where @xmath245 is the conformal factor @xmath246 from eq .",
    "( [ conformal ] ) .",
    "damour and nordvedt damournordvedt consider this function as a potential and therefore justify its choice in relation to the generic parabolic form near a potential minimum .",
    "expecting the function to be close to zero ( i.e. gr ) , santiago , kalligas and wagoner justify its expression as a perturbative expansion .",
    "this choice of @xmath31 with @xmath247 corresponds to a general two ",
    "parameter class of scalar ",
    "tensor theories that are close to gr and will be drawn ever closer to it with @xmath33 and @xmath248 as the universe expands and @xmath249 .",
    "we therefore consider it as a representative example of a wide family of plausible varying-@xmath0 theories that generalise brans - dicke .",
    "the evolution of this form of @xmath31 is shown graphically in figure [ w(phi ) ] for different values of @xmath142 and @xmath26 .",
    "clearly the evolution of @xmath31 is sensitive to both @xmath142 and @xmath26 and so the choice of these parameters is important for the form of the underlying theory . for illustrative purposes we choose here the values @xmath250 and @xmath251 and @xmath252 and @xmath251 .    in a similar way to the bd case",
    "we now create an evolution of @xmath253 that virialises at @xmath254 to give the value @xmath255 , as observed experimentally .",
    "the corresponding evolution for @xmath256 is calculated as before by matching it to the value of @xmath253 at the time the overdensity decouples from the background and begins to collapse . in creating these plots",
    "we have used the conservative parameter values @xmath257 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 which are consistent with observation and allow structure formation to occur in a similar way to general relativity .",
    "the results of this are plotted in figure [ w(phi)plot ] .",
    "again , we note the different evolution of @xmath8 in the two regions , and the difference in the asymptotic values of @xmath0 . we note that experimental measurements of @xmath0 on earth have a significant uncertainty with the 1998 codata value carrying an uncertainty 12 times _ greater _ than the standard value adopted in 1987 . the 1998 value is given as @xcite    @xmath260    while the 2002 codata pre - publication announcement reverts to the earlier higher accuracy consensus with @xcite    @xmath261    we could re  run the above analysis with different values of @xmath142 and @xmath26 , but expect that the results would look qualitatively similar . from figure [ w(phi ) ] we see that increasing ( decreasing ) the values of @xmath142 and @xmath26 will increase ( decrease ) the value of @xmath31 for a given @xmath10 , thereby making the theory more ( less ) like gr .",
    "we therefore expect an analysis with a higher ( lower ) value of @xmath142 and/or @xmath26 to look very similar to the analysis presented above with a less ( more ) rapid evolution of @xmath8 .",
    "for the sake of brevity we omit such an analysis here . _",
    "we now calculate how time and space variations of @xmath0 evolve with redshift and depend on the cdm density contrast , @xmath262 . in order to do this",
    ", we make the definitions    @xmath263    and @xmath264where @xmath210 and @xmath265 correspond to @xmath0 as measured in the overdensity and in the background universe respectively .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations , for a cluster which virialises at @xmath266 , are presented in figures [ deltag ] , [ dotg ] and [ deltag ] , respectively .",
    "these plots display the evolution of @xmath267 and @xmath268 with redshift for brans - dicke , the theory of subsection [ theory1 ] , and some other choices of @xmath31 that are specified in the captions .",
    "the parameters used in generating these plots are @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath257 and @xmath273 .",
    "these values were chosen so as to agree with observation and so that structure formation is not significantly different from that which occurs in general relativity .",
    "it is clear from the plots that different scalar - tensor theories lead to different variations of @xmath0 .",
    "the predictions of these models can be quite diverse .",
    "while some models produce higher values of @xmath0 inside the overdensity , others produce a lower one .",
    "a feature common to all models is that the value of @xmath0 and @xmath116 inside an overdensity is different from @xmath0 and @xmath116 in the background universe .",
    "the reason for these differences is that in the non  linear regime , when the overdensity decouples from the background expansion at turnaround , the field @xmath10 that drives variations in the newtonian gravitational constant  stops feeling the background expansion . after turnaround , the field inside the overdensity , @xmath229 , deviates from the field , @xmath10 , in the background universe , leading to spatial variations in @xmath0 . in reality , such spatial inhomogeneities in the value of @xmath0 are small : @xmath274 , figure [ deltag ] .",
    "the time variations of @xmath0 are even smaller than the spatial inhomogeneities but with a marked difference between the inside and outside rates of change .",
    "we find @xmath275 inside the clusters and @xmath276 in the background , figure [ dotg ] .",
    "figures [ deltagv ] , [ dotgv ] and [ deltagv ] represent the values of @xmath277 , @xmath268 and @xmath116 at the redshift of virialisation ( @xmath224 ) . once again the differences between the different scalar - tensor theories and between @xmath278 and @xmath279 are evident .",
    "figure [ deltagrhov ] shows how the cdm contrast , @xmath280 , affects the difference between the value of @xmath0 inside an overdensity and in the cosmological background .",
    "( recall that , in the einstein  de sitter model @xmath281 at virialisation , and @xmath282 at collapse ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that different scalar - tensor theories produce a different dependence .    from the numerical simulations , we see that a variation of the newtonian gravitational constant , _ of the order presented here _ , does not affect the predictions of the structure formation models . for instance , the virialisation radius and the density contrast @xmath262 of the virialised clusters are very similar to the @xmath181cdm and standard cdm models with constant @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , one should point out that different scalar - tensor theories lead to slightly different results .",
    "besides that , there is also a dependence on the initial conditions , as with many other cosmological scalar fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "different initial conditions will lead to slightly different allowed values of @xmath4 and to different cosmological behaviours of @xmath0 and @xmath210 .",
    "we have studied the inhomogeneous cosmological evolution of the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath0 within the framework of relativistic scalar - tensor theories of gravity , of which brans ",
    "dicke theory is the simplest and best known case .",
    "we began by first exploiting the conformal equivalence between these theories and general relativity to transform an existing solution of einstein s field equations to a new exact spherically symmetric inhomogeneous vacuum cosmological solution of the brans  dicke field equations .",
    "we then present a second spherically symmetric perfect - fluid solution to the brans  dicke field equations which corresponds to an overdense inhomogeneity in an asymptotically homogenous and isotropic expanding cosmological background .",
    "these exact solutions have simple enough form to allow the @xmath91 evolution to be investigated directly and can be used to model the presence of a schwarzschild - like mass in an expanding brans  dicke universe that approaches an idealised frw universe asymptotically as @xmath98 .",
    "it is noted that far from the mass @xmath0 varies very slowly with @xmath79 and that as @xmath98 the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath79 is removed altogether and only the cosmological evolution of @xmath0 with time is relevant .",
    "close to the mass , the @xmath79 variation of @xmath0 becomes more significant and we see that @xmath0 @xmath283 at small @xmath79 .",
    "we also note that in the limit @xmath33 all space and time variation in @xmath0 is removed from these solutions and general relativity is recovered .",
    "next , we increased the complexity of the model by matching together two vacuum frw  brans ",
    "dicke universes of zero and positive curvature on a spacelike time slice .",
    "this results in a simple model for a spherically symmetric perturbation in the density and curvature that is followed into the non  linear regime .",
    "the different evolutions of @xmath0 in the two regions were determined and a comparison was made of the different evolutions of @xmath0 on spacelike slices of differing time .",
    "we see from this toy model that the value of @xmath0 does indeed have a different value in regions that have decoupled from the expanding cosmological background and collapsed , compared to its value in the background itself .",
    "we were then able to repeat this construction for a more realistic matching of two frw @xmath181cdm universes of different curvature in an arbitrary scalar  tensor gravity theory .",
    "we followed the development of spherical overdensities through their expansion , separation from the background , turnaround , and subsequent collapse . applying a simple approximation to virialise the collapsing overdensities , we were then able to study the differences in @xmath284 between the non - expanding overdensity and the expanding background universe .",
    "we highlight as a special case the simple brans ",
    "dicke theory but also present results for other scalar  tensor gravity theories , specified by their defining coupling function @xmath31 .",
    "although each theory predicts a different detailed cosmological evolution of @xmath0 , a feature common to all of them is the sharp difference between the value and time evolution of @xmath0 inside bound overdensities and in the background universe .",
    "these differences will produce spatial inhomogeneities in @xmath0 with a value which depends on the scalar  tensor theory used . while some models produce higher values of @xmath0 inside the overdensity",
    ", others produce a lower one . in spite of these differences ,",
    "such spatial inhomogeneities are small @xmath285 .",
    "the differences in the time variations of @xmath0 were found , with typically @xmath286 inside the clusters and @xmath287 in the background universe in the range of theories studied .",
    "such variations in @xmath0 do not significantly alter the virialisation radius and the density contrast @xmath262 of the virialised clusters from those in standard @xmath181cdm and cdm models with constant @xmath0",
    ". nevertheless , different scalar - tensor theories lead to slightly different results .",
    "there is also a dependence on the initial conditions .",
    "different initial conditions will lead to a different value of @xmath288 and to different cosmological behaviours of @xmath0 and @xmath210 .",
    "taken as a whole these analyses show that local observational limits on varying @xmath0 made within our solar system or galaxy must be used with caution when placing constraints upon the allowed cosmological variation of @xmath0 on extragalactic scales or in the early universe .",
