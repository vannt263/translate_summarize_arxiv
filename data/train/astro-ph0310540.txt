    "the aim of the present project is the study of the dwarf irregular ( di ) galaxy ngc6822 using its pulsating variable star content .",
    "pulsating variables are tracers of different stellar population in galaxies and useful for testing theoretical models",
    ". moreover , some of them , such as the rr lyrae stars and the classical cepheids , are primary distance indicators in the local group .",
    "time - series imaging of ngc6822 was obtained at the vlt ( 36 v and 11 b images ) in 2001 august .",
    "photometric reductions were performed using daophot and allframe ( stetson 1994 ) and the candidate variables were identified using isis2.1 ( alard 2000 ) .",
    "about 450 bona fide candidate variables were detected , and all are being analysed with gratis ( graphycal analyzer of time series , see clementini et al .",
    "2000 ) in order to check their actual variation , to classify them and to determine their pulsational characteristics .",
    "the color magnitude diagram of ngc6822 shows a significant population of candidate variable stars of different types that populate all the regions where the theoretical models predict their presence ( baldacci et al .",
    "only the variables with @xmath0 ( namely variables in the horizontal branch region of the classical instability strip ) have been fully analysed so far . among them",
    "we found 17 rr lyrae stars ( 15 ab - type and 2 c - type ) and 20 brighter short - period variables that we collectively indicate as low luminosity ( ll ) cepheids ( clementini et al .",
    "all these objects have good photometric data and light curve coverage that allow an unambiguous determination of the period . since the horizontal branch of ngc6822 in completely hidden by the young and intermediate - age star populations , our detection of rr lyrae stars is the first indisputable evidence of the presence of an old stellar population ( @xmath1 gyr ) in the galaxy .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the period - amplitude ( p / a ) and the period - luminosity ( p / l ) distributions of our sample , respectively .",
    "the p / a relation of the rr lyrae stars is similar to the distribution followed by the galactic globular clusters of oosterhoff type i ( oosterhoff 1939 ) , although an intermediate distribution ( as found in many other dwarf galaxies ) is not definitely ruled out by our data .",
    "the ll cepheids are characterizated by smaller amplitudes ( at a given period ) than the rr lyrae stars , and have similar periods but lower luminosities than the short periods cepheids originally found in the small magellanic cloud by smith et al .",
    "the p / l distribution shows that there is no clear gap between rr lyrae stars and ll cepheids : the latter seem to fill up the region between the rr lyrae stars and the classical cepheids in the classical instability strip .",
    "a similar continuity in the classical instability strip has been found in the di galaxy phoenix by gallart et al .",
    "the nature of ll cepheids is still unclear . because of their distribution in the p / l diagram",
    ", they could be related both to the short periods cepheids found in other di galaxies ( ic1613 : dolphin et al .",
    "2001 ; leo a : dolphin et al . 2002 ; sextans a : dolphin et al . 2003",
    "; smc : sharpee et al .",
    "2002 ) and to the anomalous cepheids found in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. , pritzl et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the mean apparent magnitude of our rr lyrae stars is @xmath2 ( the error is the standard deviation of the average ) while the mean apparent magnitude of the subsample of variables located inside the classical instability strip ( 6 stars ) is @xmath3 , yielding a distance modulus of @xmath4 ( see clementini et al .",
    "2003 for details ) .",
    "the ll cepheids in our faint sample are on average @xmath5 mag brighter than the rr lyrae .",
    "their period distribution peaks at @xmath6 d. the lack of ll cepheids with longer periods could be due to selection effects , since our observations were optimized to provide good coverage of the light curves for variable stars with periods between 0.2 and 0.7 d. we expect to find variables with longer periods in the brighter sample we are currently investigating .",
