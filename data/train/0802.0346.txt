    "recently , a new approach to the absolute optical metrology is becoming attractive for national metrology institutes since it does not require any reference standards . it is based on the quantum properties of the parametric down conversion ( pdc ) process in which correlated light beams are generated @xcite .",
    "this new technique allows the absolute calibration of detectors in the photo - counting mode @xcite with uncertainty competitive with traditional optical radiometry method based on the use of a strongly attenuated laser beam .",
    "thus , this absolute technique ( and others related @xcite ) exploiting pdc can be used to establish absolute radiometric standards because it relies , in principle , simply on the counting of events and involves a small number of measured quantities . in an our previous work @xcite a detailed theoretical analysis has been made on the possibility to extend spontaneous pdc technique to higher photon fluxes , for calibrating analog detectors .",
    "such technique covers a large class of photodetectors from simple photodiodes , avalanche photodiodes , photo - multipliers to ccds ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason to pursuit this goal is to bridge the gap of photon rate , between photon counting regime ( less than @xmath0 photons / s ) and traditional optical radiometry ( flux higher than @xmath1 photons / s ) where the two techniques give their lowest uncertainty with the instrumentation available at the time .",
    "two essential parameters characterizing pdc are the coherence time @xmath2 and the parametric gain @xmath3 , i.e. the mean number of photons in the coherence volume of the radiation .",
    "our results confirm the possibility to calibrate an analog detector when the photon fluxes are quite small , in particular when the parametric gain @xmath3 is much less than 1 .",
    "for example , for a typical coherence time @xmath4 of the order of @xmath5 fs , and a low parametric gain @xmath6 , it corresponds to a photon flux up to @xmath7 photons / s or power lower than @xmath8 nw at 500 nm . moving toward higher power regimes this constraint",
    "is violated and calibration based on correlation measurements are no more valid .",
    "the special statistic of the fluctuations of the strongly correlated currents that allows calibration for small gain , changes substantially when the gain increases .",
    "it can be shown that in this case one should be able to collect exactly the same number of correlated modes in two selected beams among the whole emission @xcite .",
    "since spdc takes place with a very large spectral and spatial bandwidth , it would require accurate and well balanced spatial and frequency selection .",
    "this could originate systematic effects which are difficult to be evaluated .",
    "in this paper we will resume the results for spontaneous pdc working condition and we will explore the possibility to extend the pdc calibration method , without increasing the parametric gain @xmath3 , by means of stimulated emission , i.e. when a seed coherent beam , properly injected into the non - linear crystal , stimulates the emission of two correlated beams . in this case the photon fluxes can be changed adjusting the power of the coherent seed beam .",
    "the scheme for calibrating photon detectors by using parametric down conversion is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ calib_stim ] .",
    "it is based on the specific properties of this process , where a photon of the pump beam ( usually a laser beam ) `` decays '' inside a non - linear crystal into two lower - frequency photons , 1 and 2 , such that energy and momentum are conserved @xmath9 moreover , the two photons are emitted within a coherence time of tens of femtoseconds from each other .",
    "the process can be spontaneous pdc when no modes of radiation except the pump modes are injected through the input face of the crystal .",
    "if a seed mode @xmath10 is injected , its presence stimulates the process and many more photons of the pump are converted .",
    "in essence , the calibration procedure consists in placing a couple of detectors @xmath11 end @xmath12 down - stream from the nonlinear crystal , along the directions of propagation of correlated photon pairs .",
    "since the photon fluxes @xmath13 and @xmath14 incident over the sensitive area of the two detectors are correlated within @xmath15 s , the fluctuations of the recorded currents @xmath16 and @xmath17 are strictly correlated .",
    "the non ideal quantum efficiency of the detectors makes some photons missed sometimes by @xmath11 sometimes by @xmath12 , spoiling the correlation .",
    "the techniques for estimating the quantum efficiency , both in counting and in analog regime , consists in measuring this effect .        in the following the photodetection process in the analog regime",
    "will be modelled as a random pulse train    @xmath18    i.e. a very large number of discrete events at random times of occurrence @xmath19 . the pulse shape @xmath20 is determined by the transit time of charge carriers in the device . in an ideal instantaneous photodetector @xmath21 . for a real device",
    "we assume that @xmath20 is a fixed function with the characteristic width @xmath22 and a unit area .",
    "a typical value for an analog photodetector is @xmath23 ns . the pulse amplitude @xmath24 is a random variable in order to account for a possible current gain by avalanche multiplication .",
    "the statistical nature of the multiplication process gives an additional contribution to the current fluctuations usually called excess noise factor @xcite . in a photodetector without avalanche gain ,",
    "all values @xmath24 are equal to the charge @xmath25 of a single electron . in the case of ideal quantum efficiency , since the probability density of observing a photon at time @xmath26 at detector @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is related to the quantum mean value @xmath29 of the photon flux operator @xmath30 , we calculate the average current output of @xmath27 as @xmath31 where the factor @xmath32 is the average charge produced in a detection event .",
    "we have assumed the response function for the two detectors to be the same , @xmath33 .    at the same time",
    ", the auto - correlation and the cross - correlation functions for the currents can be expressed as    @xmath34    respectively for @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the auto - correlation function of the photon flux at detector @xmath37 , and for @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the cross - correlation between the fluxes incident on the two different detectors .",
    "it is convenient to express them as    @xmath40    the second contribution , proportional to the photon flux when @xmath35 , represents the the intrinsic and unavoidable component of the fluctuation that does not depend on the specific property of the field since it generates from the commutation relation o the quantum fields in the free space .",
    "the third one is the normal ordered correlation function of the fluctuation ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "actually it is a function just of the difference @xmath42 and its typical variation scale provides the coherence time @xmath4 of the pdc radiation .",
    "now we introduce the quantum efficiency @xmath43 of detector @xmath27 , defined as the number of pulses generated per incident photon . in @xcite a real detector is modelled , as usual , with an ideal one ( @xmath44 ) preceded by a beam splitter with transmission coefficient equal to the quantum efficiency of the real detector @xcite . within this picture",
    "it is possible to take into account the quantum efficiency by the following substitutions : @xmath45    thus , being @xmath46 time independent , according to eq .",
    "( [ curr ] ) we obtain : @xmath47    eq.([i_ji_k ] ) becomes    @xmath48    where we introduced the convolution of the response function of detectors @xmath49 .",
    "the normal ordered auto and cross - correlation of the fluxes has been derived ( it will be subject of a specific forthcoming paper ) in the limit of small parametric gain @xmath3 and a quite intense seed beam . in this case , the contribution of the spontaneous emission is negligible with respect to the stimulated one . concerning the signal at @xmath11 it turns out that the shot noise dominates and we have    @xmath50    the expression for the cross correlation of the current is @xmath51 where we assumed @xmath52 in evaluating eq .",
    "( [ i_ji_knew ] ) .",
    "we stress that it is the usual situation , being the coherence time of spontaneous pdc of the order of picoseconds or less and the typical resolving time of detectors of the order of nanosecond or even larger . in this case",
    "any fluctuations in the light power is averaged over @xmath22 .",
    "the auto and cross correlation function of the current fluctuations has the same form of the one obtained in the case of spontaneous pdc in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "this is the evidence that quantum correlations do not disappear when the emission is stimulated .",
    "in fact , the down - converted photons are still produced in pairs , although in the beam 2 the photons of the pairs are added to the bright original coherent beam propagating in the same direction .",
    "the factor 2 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ stimul - cross - corr ] ) can be interpreted as due to the fact that , for any down - converted photon of a pair propagating along direction 2 , there is also the original photon of the seed that stimulated the generation of that pair . according to eq.s ( [ stimul - self - corr ] ) and",
    "( [ stimul - cross - corr ] ) , the quantum efficiency can be evaluated as    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the gain ratio and @xmath55 is the excess noise factor @xcite for photodetectors with internal gain .",
    "the quantum efficiency @xmath56 of photodetector @xmath12 could be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eta - stim ] ) by measuring the auto and cross correlation functions of the current fluctuations , by means of analog correlation circuits , the gain of the two detectors and the excess noise factor from the pulse height distribution . the uncertainty on @xmath56 estimates is directly linked to the uncertainty of these contributions .",
    "since we are interested in a relatively large power of incident light , we can at first consider detectors without internal gain , and assume that the charge produced in any detection event is equal to the single electron charge @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ eta - stim ] ) can be simplified in the following way    @xmath60    where @xmath56 estimate is reduced to the ratio of the measured photocurrent correlation functions .",
    "the measurement of the correlation functions can be performed analyzing the signal spectrum of the product of the electronically amplified photocurrents . according to eq .",
    "( [ eta - stim2 ] ) the quantum efficiency can be evaluated as the ratio between the noise cross - power spectrum of @xmath61 and @xmath62 and the noise power spectrum of @xmath61 . in this case",
    "the dc component are removed .",
    "we stress that this kind of measurement does not require the absolute power calibration of the spectrum analyzer , it asks for high linearity of the instrument , since we are interesting in the ratio between two signals .",
    "the uncertainty of this scheme of measurement is basically limited by the nonlinearities of the product amplifiers @xcite .",
    "this effect could not be characterized and corrected for because of the random nature of the photocurrent signals at the input .",
    "we expect , from the devices at our knowledge , a non linearity of the order of 1% .",
    "any other contribution to the uncertainty budget ( losses in the optical path and inside the non - linear crystals , detector alignments , background light , dark currents ) has its own counterpart in the typical measurement set - up in photon counting regime and their total uncertainty contribution could be estimated of the order of @xmath63 in the best measurement conditions @xcite .",
    "carrying on with the analysis of schemes for absolute calibration of analog detector by means of spontaneous pdc @xcite , we extend our method to higher flux regimes , taking advantage of the stimulated pdc as a source of bright correlated beams .",
    "we show that even in this case the measurement of the photocurrent correlation functions in time provides a good way for calibration , giving formulas similar to the ones in @xcite .",
    "therefore , in principle , the same measurement apparatus can be used for any regimes , even if the uncertainty analysis indicates that a measurement of the power spectrum of fluctuation , discarding the background dc component , is more convenient in the stimulated configuration .",
