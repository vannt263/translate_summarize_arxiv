    "in such a communication system , instead of coding rate and capacity , normalized logarithmic density ( nld ) and generalized capacity @xmath5 are used , respectively .",
    "there exist different methods to construct lattices .",
    "one of the most distinguished ones is constructing lattices based on codes , where construction a , d and d have been proposed ( for details see e.g. @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the sphere bound can be approached by a large class of coset codes or multilevel coset codes with multistage decoding , including construction d lattices and other certain binary lattices .",
    "their results are based on channel coding theorems of information theory . as a result of their study ,",
    "the concept of volume - to - noise ( vnr ) ratio was introduced as a parameter for measuring the efficiency of lattices @xcite .",
    "the subsequent challenge in lattice theory has been to find structured classes of lattices that can be encoded and decoded with reasonable complexity in practice , and with performance that can approach the sphere - bound .",
    "this results in the transmission with arbitrary small error probability whenever vnr approaches to @xmath0",
    ". a capacity - achieving lattice can raise to a capacity - achieving lattice code by selecting a proper shaping region  @xcite .",
    "applying maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding for lattices in high dimensions is infeasible and forced researchers to apply other low complexity decoding methods for lattices to obtain practical capacity - achieving lattices .",
    "integer lattices built by construction a , d and d can be decoded with linear complexity based on soft - decision decoding of their underlying linear binary and non - binary codes @xcite .",
    "the search for sphere - bound - achieving and capacity - achieving lattices and lattice codes followed by proposing low density parity - check ( ldpc ) lattices @xcite , low density lattice codes ( ldlc )  @xcite and integer low - density lattices based on construction a ( lda )  @xcite .",
    "turbo lattices , based on construction d @xcite , and polar lattices @xcite are other families of lattices with practical decoding methods .    among the above family of lattices ,",
    "ldpc lattices are those that have sparse parity check matrices , obtained by using a set of nested binary ldpc codes as underlying codes , together with construction d. if the number of underlying ldpc codes ( or the level of construction ) is one , construction d coincides with construction a and @xmath0-level ldpc lattices are obtained @xcite . the theory behind construction a is well understood .",
    "there is a series of dualities between theoretical properties of the underlying codes and their resulting lattices .",
    "for example there are connections between the dual of the code and the dual of the lattice , or between the weight enumerator of the code and the theta series of the lattice @xcite .",
    "construction a has been generalized in different directions ; for example a generalized construction from the cyclotomic field @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 a prime , is presented in @xcite .",
    "then in @xcite , a generalized construction of lattices over a number field from linear codes is proposed .",
    "there is consequently a rich literature studying construction a over different alphabets and for different tasks .",
    "lattices have been also considered for transmission over fading channels .",
    "specifically , algebraic lattices , defined as lattices obtained via the ring of integers of a number field , provide efficient modulation schemes  @xcite for fast rayleigh fading channels .",
    "families of algebraic lattices are known to reach full diversity , the first design criterion for fading channels ; see the definition of full diversity in section [ system_model_subsec_2 ] .",
    "algebraic lattice codes are then natural candidates for the design of codes for block - fading channels .    the block - fading channel ( bf )",
    "@xcite is a useful channel model for a class of slowly - varying wireless communication channels .",
    "frequency - hopping schemes and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) , applied in many wireless communication systems standards , can conveniently be modelled as block - fading channels . in a bf channel",
    "a codeword spans a finite number @xmath2 of independent fading blocks .",
    "as the channel realizations are constant within blocks , no codeword is able to experience all the states of the channel ; this implies that the channel is non - ergodic and therefore it is not information stable .",
    "it follows that the shannon capacity of this channel is zero @xcite .",
    "as far as we are aware , all available lattice based schemes on block - fading channels were proposed by using optimal decoders @xcite which have exponential complexity in the worst - case . in this paper",
    "we propose full diversity ldpc lattices and their decoding method which is a mix of optimal decoding in small dimensions and iterative decoding .",
    "the proposed decoding algorithm makes it tractable to decode high - dimension ldpc lattices on the bf channel .",
