    "are relegated to the appendices .",
    "a nnlo analysis of a qed quantity , following perturbation theory in the number of loops , implies that contributions up to @xmath13 should be taken into account .",
    "let us review the terms contributing to the total cross section of @xmath5 production in @xmath4 annihilation up to this order .    at lowest order in qed ,",
    "the @xmath5 leptons are produced by one - photon exchange in the s - channel , and the total cross section formula reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the velocity of the final @xmath5 leptons in the center - of - mass frame of the @xmath16 pair and @xmath17 is the @xmath5 mass .",
    "@xmath18 is an adequate expansion parameter for observables evaluated at energies close to the production threshold , since its value goes to zero as we approach this point .",
    "this makes @xmath19 vanish in that limit , being the global factor @xmath18 in ( [ s0 ] ) of kinematic origin .",
    "the quantum numbers of the @xmath20 pair are those of the photon , @xmath21 , which corresponds to allowed @xmath20 states @xmath22 and @xmath23 in spectroscopic notation @xmath24 .",
    "electromagnetic corrections of @xmath25 to @xmath19 arise from the interference between the tree level result and the following 1-loop amplitudes :    * @xmath25 corrections to the @xmath26 vertex , * @xmath25 corrections to the @xmath27 vertex , * vacuum polarization , * box diagrams ( 2-photon production ) .    the contributions from _",
    "i ) _ and _ ii ) _ are usually expressed in terms of the dirac and pauli form factors at one loop @xcite .",
    "the corrections to the photon propagator _",
    "iii ) _ are divided into two pieces : the leptonic contribution ( @xmath28 ) , which can be calculated perturbatively in qed , and the hadronic contribution , where qcd corrections make a perturbative estimate at low energies unreliable .",
    "the hadronic vacuum polarization can be related to the total cross section of hadron production by means of a dispersion relation .",
    "finally , the interference of the tree  level amplitude with box diagrams _ iv ) _ does not contribute to the total cross section , by virtue of furry s theorem .",
    "besides the above virtual radiative corrections , the cross section of @xmath8 corresponding to the process of real photon emission , @xmath29 , must be added .",
    "the bremsstrahlung photon can be emitted by the initial or final fermion lines , but there is no contribution to the total cross section from the interference between both sets of diagrams , again due to furry s theorem .",
    "we clearly see that there is no overlap between initial and final state radiative corrections for the total cross section up to @xmath8 .",
    "a compilation of analytical expressions for all the terms mentioned above is found in ref .",
    "let us consider next @xmath30 electromagnetic corrections to the born cross section .",
    "they come from several sources :    * interferences between the one - loop diagrams mentioned previously . the total cross section contributions from interferences between _",
    "i ) _ , _ ii ) _ and _ iii ) _ with box diagrams are again zero .",
    "the first term involving two - photon @xmath5 production comes from the square amplitude of the box diagrams .",
    "* interferences between the born term and the following two - loop amplitudes : the electron and the @xmath5 vertex two - loop corrections , contained in the expressions of the electromagnetic form factors , @xmath25 corrections to the vacuum polarization , and three - photon production diagrams , for which only the real part is needed . * the @xmath11 bremsstrahlung cross section , coming from the interference between tree - level and one - loop diagrams with",
    "one radiated photon , and from tree - level diagrams with two photons attached in any of the fermion lines , corresponding to the process @xmath31 .",
    "it is no longer true , at this order , that initial and final state real radiation could not interfere .",
    "recall that the spectral density @xmath32 built from the electromagnetic current of the @xmath5 leptons collects all final  state interactions , including both virtual and real radiation , for single - photon production , that is @xmath33 where the tilde on @xmath34 distinguishes it from the physical total cross section which includes all kind of corrections .",
    "relation ( [ spectral ] ) results from a direct application of the optical theorem , and is more commonly written as the ratio @xmath35 i.e. , normalizing @xmath36 to the point cross section @xmath37 .",
    "the ratio @xmath38 is well suited for studying the non - relativistic dynamics of the @xmath20 pair , as it fully contains the final ",
    "state interaction .",
    "therefore , the threshold behaviour of the total cross section will be ruled by the expansion of @xmath38 at low velocities .",
    "the perturbative qed expression of @xmath38 is given in appendix a up to nnlo in the combined expansion in powers of @xmath39 and @xmath18 .",
    "as long as we do not care about multiple photon production of @xmath5 leptons , neither consider interference between initial and final state radiation , it is possible to factorize the total cross section as an integration over the product of separate pieces including initial , intermediate and final state corrections : @xmath40 the radiation function @xmath41 @xcite describes initial state radiation , including virtual corrections , and @xmath42 is the total energy in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the integration emerges to account for the effective energy loss due to photon emission from the @xmath16 pair .",
    "as previously mentioned , ( [ secradr ] ) is an exact relation for the total cross section only up to @xmath43 , but it includes the largest corrections coming from the emission of an arbitrary number of initial photons , which can sizeably suppress the total cross section .",
    "the @xmath13 contributions not included in this analysis are those coming from two- and three - photon production diagrams , for which no velocity enhancement is expected in the threshold region and so represent pure @xmath44 corrections @xmath45 , and the interferences between 2-photon bremsstrahlung diagrams overlapping initial and final state radiation .",
    "however , we shall argue in section  [ sec : nrqed ] that bremsstrahlung contributions start at nnnlo in the combined expansion in @xmath39 and @xmath18 , and so they are beyond the scope of our analysis .",
    "we now focus on the behaviour of the total cross section in the region just above the production threshold , where the small velocity of the produced @xmath5 leptons is another relevant parameter , besides @xmath39 . the final ",
    "state @xmath2 interactions are encoded in the electromagnetic form factors . written in terms of @xmath18 , their expressions at one and two loops",
    "@xcite show the existence of @xmath46 and @xmath47 power - like divergences in the limit @xmath48 .",
    "this is a general result for any number of loops : diagrams with @xmath49 uncrossed photons exchanged between the produced leptons generate singular terms proportional to @xmath50 , known as coulomb singularities , which lead to a breakdown of the qed perturbative series in @xmath39 when @xmath48 .",
    "resummation of such terms is therefore mandatory , and it was done a long time ago @xcite , resulting in the well - known sommerfeld factor @xmath51 multiplying the born cross section  ( [ s0 ] ) .",
    "this factor corresponds to the wave function at the origin , solution of the schrdinger equation , of two conjugate charged particles of mass @xmath52 interacting through a coulomb potential for positive energies @xmath53 .",
    "the appearence of this factor in the cross section can be intuitively understood , since the coulomb interaction modifies the scattered wave function of the lepton pair .",
    "the @xmath54 behaviour of this factor makes the cross section at threshold finite .",
    "we clearly see that a nnlo calculation of the cross section in the kinematic region where @xmath55 has to account for all terms proportional to @xmath56 $ ] with @xmath57 the leading divergences ( i.e. @xmath50 , @xmath58 ) can be treated by using well - known results from non - relativistic quantum mechanics , but a systematic way to calculate higher - order corrections in this regime , such as @xmath59 $ ] , seems to be far from obvious , at least from the point of view of covariant perturbation theory in the number of loops .",
    "an adequate description would come from a simplified theory which keeps the relevant physics at the scale @xmath60 , characteristic of the coulomb interaction , allowing for a clear and systematic identification of leading contributions .",
    "nrqed @xcite was designed precisely for this purpose .",
    "it is an effective field theory of qed at low energies , applicable to fermions in non - relativistic regimes , i.e. with typical momenta @xmath61 .",
    "interactions contained in the nrqed lagrangian ( [ nrqedlagrangian ] ) have a definite velocity counting but propagators and loop integrations can also generate powers of @xmath18 . with appropriate counting rules at hand , one can prove that all interactions between the non - relativistic pair @xmath2 can be described up to nnlo in terms of time - independent potentials @xcite , derived from the low - energy lagrangian .",
    "it can also be shown that the contributions to the total cross section from diagrams with real photons emitted from the produced heavy leptons begin at nnnlo   at tree level ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; the leading term is @xmath62 , i.e. nnnlo compared to lo terms @xmath63 . ] .",
    "the key observable to study threshold effects in @xmath2 production is the 2-point function , @xmath64 calculated at nnlo .",
