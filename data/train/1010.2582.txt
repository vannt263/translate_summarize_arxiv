    "the first generation of stars in the universe is the stellar population without any metal elements , or so - called population iii ( pop iii ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this population is expected to be as massive as @xmath7 @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and is thought to play an important role on the cosmic reionization at @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "how long did such metal - free star formation last in the universe ?",
    "although the metal enrichment in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is uncertain , if it is inefficient , metal - free haloes may form until @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , or even @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the metal mixing process in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of a galaxy is also uncertain , but a significant amount of metal - free gas may coexist with enriched gas for a few hundred myr @xcite . if it is true , metal - free stars may continue to form in galaxies for such a long time .",
    "the he ii @xmath151640 emission line is proposed as a signature of pop iii stars because of their very hard ionizing spectrum expected theoretically @xcite .",
    "@xcite made a wide and deep survey of the emission line at @xmath16 and obtained an upper limit on pop iii star formation rate density at the redshift .",
    "on the other hand , the emission line has been found in a composite spectrum of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that it was a signature of the metal - free stellar population in the lbgs .",
    "however , this he ii line is broad ( fwhm @xmath17 km s@xmath18 ) , and thus , it is probably caused by stellar winds from wolf - rayet stars with ` normal ' metallicity @xcite .",
    "another signature of pop iii stars is a very large ly@xmath1 equivalent width ( ew ) as @xmath19   @xcite .",
    "some surveys of lyman @xmath1 emitters ( laes ) found galaxies with such a large ly@xmath1 ew at @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "however , a clumpy dusty medium may boost the ew only apparently @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a large uncertainty on the ew measurements because laes are so faint that we may not measure their continuum level accurately enough .    the stellar population with metal mass fraction ( or metallicity )",
    "@xmath22 , which is @xmath23 @xmath24 , is classified as extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may be the second generation of stars @xcite .",
    "hundreds of low - mass emp stars have been found in the halo of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of their long lifetime , these stars are survivors of the early stage of the formation of the galaxy . on the other hand , it is expected that their high - mass counterpart existed in the early days and died out until the current epoch @xcite . yet",
    ", there is no direct observational evidence of such massive emp stars at high-@xmath25 .",
    "although there is no confident observational signature of primordial massive stellar populations such as pop iii and massive emp stars so far , these populations should exist in the early universe .",
    "these stars emit strong ionizing radiation which should have played an important role in the cosmic reionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have affected the galaxy formation in the subsequent epoch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , looking for these stellar populations is highly important to understand the feedback process by the first generation of stars and galaxies as well as to prove their existence .",
    "very recently , some candidates of galaxies at @xmath26 have been discovered by the standard drop - out technique from the new data taken with the wfc3/ir camera on the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found that the ultraviolet ( uv ) colour of the @xmath26 candidate galaxies was so blue that the galaxies may be composed of emp or metal - free stellar populations .",
    "however , we should confirm that the redshifts of the galaxies are really @xmath26 with spectroscopy , which is too difficult to do with current facilities .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper i ) has proposed a new method to find the hypothetical stellar populations like massive emp and metal - free stars at @xmath27 .",
    "when lyman continuum ( lyc ) emitted by stars escapes from galaxies , the lyc emitted by photo - ionized nebulae around ionizing stars may also escape .",
    "this bound - free nebular lyc has a peak just below the lyman limit , so that a spectral ` bump ' appears at the lyman limit .",
    "we call this ` lyman bump ' or more precisely ` lyman limit bump ' .",
    "the strength of the lyman bump depends on the hardness of the stellar lyc .",
    "thus , more metal - poor galaxies will show stronger lyman bump . on the other hand ,",
    "neutral hydrogen remains in the igm even after the completion of the reionization and it significantly absorbs the lyc .",
    "it makes difficult to find lyc or lyman bump at @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "are there galaxies with a lyman bump in the real universe ?",
    "this paper intends to show that the answer is yes .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter i09 ) discovered 10 laes and 7 lbgs at @xmath10 with a significant leakage of their lyc captured in a deep narrowband image taken with the subaru / suprime - cam ( s - cam ) .",
    "some of the laes are indeed brighter in lyc than in non - ionizing uv , strongly suggesting the presence of the lyman limit bump .",
    "however , there was a possibility that these objects are at lower-@xmath25 because of a narrow wavelength coverage of previous spectroscopy which only confirmed an emission line .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first describe the sample of the possible lyc emitting laes discovered by i09 . in section 3 , we present results of follow - up spectroscopy with vlt / vimos and subaru / focas . in section 4",
    ", we thoroughly examine the redshift of the laes ( i.e. the reality of the detected lyc ) with the follow - up deep spectra and conclude that at least three laes are real lyc emitters . in section 5 , we compare the observed strength of the lyc with the lyman bump model proposed by paper i and show that the laes are likely to contain massive metal - free or emp stars . in section 6 , we present a summary of our results , an evolutionary scenario of the laes , and a few implications of the existence of primordial stars at @xmath10 .",
    "we adopt the ab magnitude system @xcite to describe object magnitudes and colours in section 5 . the standard flat @xmath29cdm cosmology with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32",

    "if galaxies contain dust , they are reddened .",
    "let us assume two types of dust attenuation law : the calzetti law @xcite and the extinction law of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "the former attenuation law was derived from spectra of local uv - selected starburst galaxies @xcite and is routinely assumed in studies of high-@xmath25 galaxies .",
    "however , recent studies for @xmath353 lbgs suggest that a steeper attenuation law than the calzetti one is favourable for some cases @xcite .",
    "thus , we also adopt the smc law which is the steepest among the known attenuation / extinction laws .",
    "we use the model by @xcite which reproduces the empirical smc extinction law very well .",
    "the calzetti law is originally only for @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "however , we simply extrapolate the original formula for @xmath37  .",
    "this could be justified by the study of @xcite up to @xmath38   ( but see also @xcite ) and also be justified by the model of @xcite which does not show any breaks or features up to about 700   for graphite and astronomical silicate @xcite .",
    "table  5 gives a summary of the dust reddenings .    in figure  6",
    ", we show the region which can be explained by a model with normal sub - solar metallicity and imf and with a combination of dust and igm attenuations .",
    "while a half of lbgs are found in the region , all the laes are out of it .",
    "we need a new model to explain these laes .",
    "paper i has proposed the importance of an additional contribution by escaping nebular lyc . for an escape of the stellar lyc",
    ", the ionized nebulae should be ` matter - bounded ' , at least along some lines of sight , from which we can also expect an escape of nebular lyc produced by the recombination process .",
    "paper i shows that this escaping nebular lyc makes a peaky spectral feature just below the lyman limit , which we call lyman limit ` bump ' ( see figs .  3 and 4 in paper i ) .",
    "in fact , our nb359 filter exactly captures this lyman limit bump at @xmath39 .",
    "let us compare this scenario with the observed strength of lyc .",
    "figure  9 shows how the lyman limit bump blues nb359@xmath40 colour ; the colour becomes bluer when a fraction of lyc is absorbed by nebulae and reemitted in the lyman limit bump than when all the lyc escapes .",
    "indeed , the bluest colour is realized when about 40% lyc is absorbed ( i.e. the escape fraction is about 60% ) , irrespective of the stellar population model .",
    "based on figure  9 , we find that moderate sub - solar metallicity and normal imf ( solid line : model a1 ) can not reach nb359@xmath41 ( 0.7 ) for the minimum ( median ) igm attenuation even if we consider the additional contribution by nebular lyc . on the other hand ,",
    "some @xmath39 laes detected in lyc show a much bluer colour .",
    "furthermore , even the laes with nb359@xmath42 are difficult to be explained because of their red colour in @xmath43 which expect much redder nb359@xmath40 as shown in figure  6 .",
    "colour for @xmath2 galaxies , which corresponds to the strength of the lyman limit ` bump ' , as a function of the escape fraction of stellar lyc : ( a ) minimum igm attenuation case and ( b ) median igm attenuation case .",
    "the curves are the models with escaping nebular lyc : the long - dashed curve for the model d in table  4 , the short - dashed curve for the model c , the dot - dashed curve for the model b1 , and the solid curve for the model a1 .",
    "the nebular gas temperature is assumed to be @xmath44 k.,width=264 ]     ( model ac1 ) : ( a ) age from the onset of star formation of 100 myr and ( b ) 10 myr .",
    "the dotted curves indicate colour sequences as a function of the escape fraction of stellar lyc with the minimum igm attenuation .",
    "the symbols indicate the positions with the escape fraction of 1.0 , 0.1 , or 0.01 .",
    "the shaded regions indicate the regions explained with a combination of igm and dust attenuations . from thin to thick , the cumulative probability to have the amount of the igm attenuation increases . the smc extinction law is adopted for the dust attenuation as shown by the solid arrow .",
    "the nebular gas temperature is assumed to be @xmath44 k.,width=264 ]    : ( a ) normal imf ( model a1 ; solid line with triangles ) and ( b ) extremely top - heavy imf ( model b1 : mean stellar mass of @xmath45 @xmath8 ; dot - dashed line with crosses).,width=264 ]     @xmath8 ) stellar population with ( a ) @xmath46 ( model c ; short - dashed line with asterisks ) and ( b ) @xmath47 ( model d ; long - dashed line with diamonds).,width=264 ]    figures  1012 show the two - colour diagrams same as figure  6 but with escaping nebular lyc models . in each panel ,",
    "the curve with symbols shows the colour sequence as a function of the escape fraction of the stellar lyc .",
    "we have assumed the minimum igm attenuation for the curves .",
    "the symbols indicate the colours when the escape fraction is 1.0 ( i.e. pure stellar colour + minimum igm ) , 0.1 , or 0.01 .",
    "as the escape fraction decreases , nb359@xmath40 colour first becomes bluer than the stellar one due to the lyman limit bump as shown in figure  9 , and then , the colour turns over when the escape fraction is about 0.6 and becomes redder and redder after the bluest point . in the same time , @xmath43 colour becomes redder than the stellar one because of the nebular continuum by two - photon and bound - free processes .",
    "the amount of these colour changes depends on the strength of the stellar lyc : larger changes by stronger lyc .",
    "the shaded region in each panel of figures  1012 shows the colours explained by a combination of igm and dust attenuations for a specific stellar population model .",
    "the thickness of the shades indicate the cumulative probability of the igm attenuation : higher probability , thicker . we have assumed the smc extinction law for the dust attenuation but the calzetti law cases are included in the shaded regions like in figure  6 .",
    "figure  10 shows the cases of the normal stellar population with a constant star formation ( ac1 in table  4 ) .",
    "we have assumed @xmath48 , very low , but , sometimes observed metallicity ( hereafter we call it normally sub - solar ) . the case with @xmath49 is always redder in nb359@xmath40 than the case with @xmath48 .",
    "we find that all the laes ( filled and open circles ) and half of the lbgs ( squares ) can not be explained even with the duration of the star formation of 10100 myr which is younger than a typical age of lbgs ( @xmath50 myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the lyc emitting laes should have a stellar population much younger than 10 myr or much more massive than the standard salpeter imf .",
    "figure  11 shows the cases of very young ( age of 1 myr ) stellar populations with @xmath48 , normally sub - solar metallicity .",
    "the case with @xmath49 is about 0.2 mag redder in nb359@xmath40 than the case . assuming the standard salpeter imf ( panel [ a ] ; model a1 )",
    ", we find that it is still difficult to explain all the laes . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume an extremely top - heavy imf whose mean mass is about 50 @xmath8 ( panel [ b ] ; model b1 ) , the laes without line offset ( filled circles ) can be explained with an attenuation smaller than the median .",
    "however , it is still difficult to explain the laes with line offset ( open circles ) .",
    "we may have a few true lyc emitters in the 5 objects because we have statistically rejected the possibility that all the 5 have a faint foreground object accounting for the nb359 flux in  4.2.2 .",
    "there is another difficulty of the model b1 .",
    "the critical metallicity for the imf change from the standard to top - heavy , @xmath51 @xcite is expected to be much lower than @xmath48 which is assumed in the model b1 .",
    "thus , a very massive imf under the relatively ` high ' metallicity in the model b1 is unlikely .",
    "then , we conclude that it is difficult to explain the strength of lyc of the laes with normally sub - solar metallicity unless the critical metallicity for the imf change is much higher than expected in the literature .",
    "figure  12 shows the cases of very young ( age of 1 myr ) and massive ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) stellar populations with @xmath46 ( emp ; model c ; panel [ a ] ) and @xmath47 ( pop iii ; model d ; panel [ b ] ) . in these cases",
    ", we can expect a very massive imf according to the critical metallicity scenario @xcite . with the model c",
    ", we can easily explain the three laes which are confirmed to be true lyc emitters , whereas the laes with line offset are still difficult , except for the object * b*. the pop iii case ( model d ) can explain the objects * b * and * c * , and marginally explain *",
    "e * and * h*. the object * d * is still difficult but this object shows the largest offset of the ly@xmath1 ( table  2 ) , and thus , the foreground probability is the highest . on the other hand ,",
    "the object * c * shows the smallest offset and is the most likely object as a real lyc emitter among the 5 offset laes .",
    "enough interestingly , the pop iii model can explain the object with a 120% smallest igm attenuation . in summary ,",
    "very young ( @xmath6 myr ) and massive ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) emp stars can reproduce the observed colours of the three laes without line offset and pop iii stars can reproduce even the colours of most of the laes with line offset . _ because a few line - offset laes are likely to be real lyc emitters , we conclude that the pop iii model is the most favourable stellar population for the lyc emitting laes . _      , and a normal imf ) in table  4 .",
    "a constant star formation of 100 myr is assumed for the underlying population .",
    "the smc extinction law is assumed for the panel ( a ) but the calzetti attenuation law is assumed for ( b ) .",
    "the median igm attenuation is assumed for both panels .",
    "the short - dashed curves are the sequences of the colour as a function of the mass fraction of pop iii stars for dust - free underlying stellar population .",
    "the solid , dot - dashed , and long - dashed curves are the same sequences but for dusty underlying population with @xmath34 , 0.2 , and 0.3 , respectively .",
    "note that the pop iii stars are assumed to be always dust - free .",
    "the positions for the mass fraction of 0.1 , 0.01 , 0.001 , and 0.0001 are indicated by dotted curves with squares , triangles , asterisks , and plus - mark , respectively . for pop iii stars ,",
    "the contribution of escaping nebular lyc is taken into account , assuming the escape fraction of 0.5 .",
    "the colour sequence with other escape fractions is shown by the triple - dot - dashed curve as in fig .",
    "12 . for the underlying population ,",
    "the escape fraction of 0.01 is assumed.,width=264 ]    the previous subsection shows that the laes detected in lyc by i09 are likely to contain a primordial stellar population such as massive pop iii or emp stars . but how much amount of these exotic stars are required in them ? also , are pop iii stars really compatible with a slight dust attenuation which is required to explain some laes with line offset and red in @xmath43 in figure  12 ? to discuss these questions ,",
    "let us consider a system in which a primordial stellar population and a normal stellar population with sub - solar metallicity and salpeter imf coexist .",
    "we assume that the normal population makes stars with a constant rate ; the model ac2 in table  4 is adopted for this population .",
    "for the primordial population , we adopt the model d ( pop iii ) .",
    "the stellar mass of the normal population is defined as the multiple of the star formation rate and the duration ; we neglect the loss of the stellar death for simplicity .",
    "the mass fraction of the primordial population in the total stellar mass is a parameter for the mixture .",
    "the contribution of nebular continuum in lyc and in other wavelengths is taken into account for both populations but with different escape fractions : 0.5 for the primordial population and 0.01 for the normal population .",
    "k. however , this hot gas contribution is negligible as shown in fig",
    ".  3 of paper i. ] the normal population may exist in dusty environment , but the primordial population are likely to be dust - free .",
    "we adopt two dust attenuation laws : the smc extinction law and the calzetti attenuation law as described in  5.3 only for the normal underlying population .",
    "the required mass fraction of the primordial stellar population depends on the duration of the star formation in the underlying normal population .",
    "this is because the mass of the primordial population which is required to explain blue nb359@xmath40 colour does not change very much because the colour is determined mainly by the primordial population , while the mass of the underlying population is proportional to the duration .",
    "for example , we consider 100 myr as a duration for @xmath52 galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  13 .",
    "for other durations , the primordial mass fraction is roughly estimated by an inverse relation to the durations of the underlying star formation .",
    "although we assumed the median igm attenuation in figure  13 , the readers can shift all the model curves along the horizontal axis for other igm attenuations .",
    "the laes without offset ( objects * a * , * f * and * g * ; filled circles in fig .  13 ) require a primordial mass fraction of 0.110% depending on the igm and dust attenuations as well as the star formation duration .",
    "the dust attenuation for the underlying population is modest as @xmath530.1 for the smc case or up to 0.3 for the calzetti case , which is reasonable for @xmath10 laes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the bluest laes ( objects * b * and * c * ; open circles ) require a primordial mass fraction of more than 10% , but we could not reject the possibility that their nb359 flux was foreground contamination individually (  4.2 ) .",
    "the laes which are red in @xmath43 ( objects * d * , * e * and * h * ; open circles ) can be explained by a model with the smc law and a small amount of attenuation as @xmath540.3 and with a primordial mass fraction of a few 0.1% .",
    "when the calzetti law is adopted , the red laes require a large amount of dust attenuation as @xmath55 which may be too large .",
    "note that the possibility which the nb359 flux of these objects , especially * d * and * e * , are foreground contamination is the largest because of the largest line offset (  4.2 ) .",
    "the lbgs from which i09 reported detections of lyc ( filled squares ) are found in the range of the primordial mass fraction of 0.011 % depending on the dust attenuations .",
    "thus , only a very small amount of primordial stars can account for the observed lyc of these galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "some of these lbgs can be explained by a normal population with a large escape fraction of @xmath56 as shown in figures  10 and 11 .",
    "therefore , the primordial stars are not mandatory for them .",
    "we have investigated the nature of the laes at @xmath39 detected in our deep narrowband nb359 imaging with subaru / s - cam .",
    "the nb359 captures lyc from @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we detect lyc from the laes if they are at @xmath39 .",
    "these laes are special because of their surprisingly strong lyc relative to non - ionizing uv ( i09 ) .",
    "deep follow - up spectroscopy with vlt / vimos and subaru / focas for 8 such laes presented in  3 shows that at least three of them are highly likely to be at @xmath39 and the nb359 captures truly their lyc (  4.1.1 and  4.1.2 ) . from the spectra of the three laes",
    ", we have derived the rest - frame ew of ly@xmath1 which are not very large as expected from primordial stellar population models such as pop iii stars .",
    "we have also derived upper limits on the he ii @xmath58 emission line which are not strict enough to reject pop iii star formation ( table  3 ) .",
    "other five out of the 8 laes show a @xmath3 offset between the ly@xmath1 emission and the continuum detected in nb359 ( figure  1 ) . for these laes",
    ", we could not determine the redshifts of the continuum sources (  4.2.1 ) .",
    "however , it is statistically difficult that all the five have foreground contamination which explain the nb359 detections (  4.2.2 ) . thus , nb359 may capture lyc from a few of the five laes with line offset .    very interestingly ,",
    "all the laes reported by i09 are too bright in lyc to be explained by normal stellar population models ( figure  6 ) .",
    "although we reduced igm opacity to match the latest lls statistics ( figures 7 and 8) , compared to the previous estimate , this is true even for the three laes which are confirmed to be at @xmath39 . unlike traditional spectral models of galaxies , paper i proposed a new model taking an escape of nebular lyc into account",
    "this model expects a strong flux excess just below the lyman limit : we call it lyman limit ` bump ' .",
    "we tried to explain the observed strength in lyc of the laes with this new lyman ` bump ' model . as a result",
    ", we have found that the colour of the laes can not be explained by the stellar population with the standard salpeter imf and normally sub - solar metallicity ( @xmath59 ) even with the lyman ` bump ' ( figures  10 and 11a ) .",
    "if we assume a very young ( @xmath6 myr ) stellar population with an extremely top - heavy imf ( mean mass of @xmath45 @xmath8 ) and @xmath48 , the three laes without line offset can be explained with a relatively smaller igm attenuation but other five laes with line offset can not be explained yet ( figure 11b ) . because ( 1 ) a few of the line - offset laes are possibly to be real lyc emitters and ( 2 ) the expected critical metallicity for a top - heavy imf is much lower than the assumed @xmath48",
    ", we reject this model .",
    "this suggests that the laes contain a significant amount of ` primordial ' stars such as emp or pop iii stars .",
    "a very young ( @xmath6 myr ) and massive ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) emp model can reproduce the observed colours of one line - offset lae as well as the laes without offset ( figure 12a ) . a pop iii model ( @xmath6 myr and @xmath7 @xmath8 ) can reproduce all but one laes discussed here ( figure 12b ) .",
    "the last lae ( object * d * ) shows the largest offset between nb359 position and ly@xmath1 , thus , the possibility of a foreground contamination in nb359 is the highest .",
    "finally , we conclude that the pop iii model is the most favourable stellar population for the lyc emitting laes although the emp model may be still compatible .",
    "if we consider a combination of two stellar populations , ` primordial ' and ` normal ' sub - solar metallicity with dust , the uv two - colour diagram of all the laes and lbgs can be well explained ( figure  13 ) . in this case",
    ", the mass fraction of the ` primordial ' stars is estimated to be 0.110% or more for laes with @xmath60 , a few 0.1% for laes with @xmath61 ( but these may be foreground contamination ) , and 0.011 % for lbgs , depending on the age of the galaxies , dust content , and igm attenuation ( figure  13 ) .",
    "we also note that the lbgs can be explained by normal stellar populations and emp or pop iii stars are not mandatory for them .",
    "the lyman ` bump ' galaxies presented in this paper is a new population of high-@xmath25 galaxies .",
    "indeed , they were missed in standard ` drop - out ' surveys because they are not ` drop - out ' but have an excess flux in lyc : lyman ` bump ' .",
    "because we started from a sample selected based on a narrowband excess by the ly@xmath1 emission line , we did find another excess in lyc .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite started from a lbg sample , i.e. ` drop - out ' sample , and thus , they could not find any galaxies with a lyman ` bump ' .",
    "this new population of galaxies probably often emits a strong ly@xmath1 emission because they should intrinsically emit strong lyc although a half of the lyc may directly escape .",
    "therefore , starting from a lae sample selected by a narrowband would be the best to sample the lyman ` bump ' galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , if all the laes had lyman ` bump ' , i.e. no ` drop - out ' , laes and lbgs would separate well .",
    "however , a significant fraction of lbgs overlap with laes in fact ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may imply that the fraction of laes having lyman ` bump ' is small although the igm attenuation may play a role to hide the lyman ` bump ' and to make ` drop - out ' .",
    "a caveat is the lack of the confirmation of the lyman limit ` bump ' in spectroscopy .",
    "our argument of finding the lyman limit ` bump ' is only based on narrowband photometry .",
    "we should confirm the feature in spectroscopy in future .",
    "the model with two stellar populations shown in figure  13 simultaneously reproduces the strength of the lyman limit ` bump ' and non - ionizing uv slope of the laes and lbgs detected in lyc by i09 . in the model",
    ", we have assumed that a primordial stellar population which is dust - free coexists with ` normal ' stars with sub - solar metallicity and dust .",
    "we here discuss a possible scenario which may justify this assumption .",
    "figure  14 shows a schematic picture of the scenario .",
    "the hierarchical structure formation scenario argues that a galaxy is assembled from many subgalactic minihaloes .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamics simulations have shown that the galaxy assembly occurs through cosmic filaments and galaxies reside at nodes of the filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite examined the first galaxy assembly at @xmath62 and found that in a @xmath63 @xmath8 halo , @xmath64 very massive metal - free stars , so - called population iii.1 , were formed before the assembly .",
    "as a radiative feedback by the pop iii.1 stars , pristine gas which was ionized once by the pop iii.1 stars can be more abundant in h@xmath65 and hd than before , cool more efficiently , and form intermediate - mass metal - free stars , so - called population iii.2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as a result , @xcite expected that gas infalling onto the central part of a galaxy in the potential well likely forms pop iii.2 during the assembly if the gas remains primordial .",
    "the pop iii.1 and iii.2 stars emit intense lyc which produces cosmological h ii and he iii regions .",
    "the escape fraction of lyc is expected to be very high ( 6090% ; @xcite ) and the nebular lyc can make a significant lyman limit ` bump ' ( phase - i ) .    while very massive pop iii.1 may become blackhole directly and make no contribution to the metal enrichment , pop iii.2 stars will end their life with core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) and enrich surrounding gas with metal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time , dust grains are also formed by the sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the metal and dust enrichment starts from the central part of the galaxy where the mode of star formation changes into the ` normal ' mode ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the multiple sne blast waves make a supershell which contains dust grains , the dust attenuation becomes a screen geometry in which the dust attenuation law is determined only by dust optical properties .",
    "if the dust properties resemble the smc which is also making an intense star formation , the reddening law has a steep wavelength dependence like the smc extinction law which is assumed in the upper panel of figure  13 . on the other hand , primordial gas and pop iii stars may be still infalling onto the galaxy from the igm .",
    "these infalling primordial stars can make a significant lyman limit ` bump ' ( phase - ii ) .",
    "as the star formation proceeds in the main part of the galaxy , dust and metal are mixed well in the ism .",
    "in such a medium , the wavelength dependence of the dust attenuation law becomes weak and expected to be similar to the calzetti law @xcite which is assumed in the lower panel of figure  13 . even in this late stage",
    ", a small portion of the surrounding igm may remain primordial if the metal enrichment in the igm is not efficient .",
    "the primordial gas may form pop iii stars during its infalling process through a cosmic filament ( phase - iii ) .    with this scenario",
    ", we can explain the two - colour diagram as follows ; the laes correspond to the phase - ii ( or possibly phase - i ) .",
    "if the age of the galaxies is 10100 myr , the primordial mass fraction is @xmath610% or more in some cases .",
    "the amount of the dust attenuation for the underlying population is @xmath530.3 .",
    "the lbgs correspond to the phase - iii because of their relatively large stellar mass ( @xmath66 @xmath8 ) .",
    "if the age is 1001,000 myr , the primordial mass fraction is @xmath67% and typically @xmath68% .",
    "the amount of the dust attenuation is @xmath530.3 which is similar to laes but the attenuation laws may be different from each other .",
    "we can also explain another observational fact : spatial displacements of lyc and non - ionizing uv of the lbgs found in i09 . as shown in fig .  2 of i09 ,",
    "lyc detected position coincides with a substructure found in the periphery of the main component of the lbgs , although some of these lyc emitting spots might be foreground contaminations @xcite . in our scenario , we expect that primordial stars emitting lyc exist in the periphery of the galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is exactly the finding from the lbgs by i09 .",
    "we also expect that laes show a smaller offset between lyc and non - ionizing uv than lbgs . according to i09 , the offsets of the laes are not significant , and thus , smaller than those found in the lbgs .",
    "again , this is consistent with our scenario .",
    "on the other hand , we have found another spatial displacement between continuum including lyc and ly@xmath1 emission line in some laes .",
    "while these continua may not come from the laes but from foreground objects , the probability that all the laes with line offset have a foreground contamination is very low as seen in  4.2.2 .",
    "we have also proposed a possible mechanism to produce such a line offset in  4.2.3 : the laes are composed of several unresolved substructures which have different ly@xmath1 ews .",
    "this mechanism may fit in our scenario as follows : in the phase - ii , the continuum including lyc comes from substructures in the periphery and ly@xmath1 emission comes from the dusty central component , because the ly@xmath1 transmission can be higher than the continuum transmission if the dust is confined in clumps in the supershell @xcite .",
    "massive ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) emp or pop iii stars exist in @xmath10 laes if our interpretation is correct",
    ". since these primordial stars are short - lived ( a few myr ) because of their mass , pristine gas should remain to form them until @xmath10 .",
    "this argument is not consistent with a scenario of global metal enrichment by pop iii stars at very early epoch @xcite , in which the entire universe was enriched to a metallicity floor as @xmath69 by pop iii stars at @xmath70 . on the other hand ,",
    "recent studies suggest inhomogeneous metal enrichment in the igm and an extended epoch of pop iii star formation as described below .",
    "observations of metal absorbers in high-@xmath25 qso spectra show that metal enrichment in ly@xmath1 forest is inhomogeneous @xcite . for example , simcoe et al .",
    "( 2004 ) show that @xmath71% of lines of sight at @xmath72 have metallicity lower than the detection limit of @xmath73 .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamics simulations also show that metal enrichment in the igm proceeds in a very inhomogeneous way and that a significant volume in the igm remains pristine until a lower redshift @xcite .",
    "for example , oppenheimer et al .  (",
    "2009 ) show that only @xmath6% volume in the igm is enriched to @xmath69 by @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , igm metal enrichment is likely to proceed in a patchy way and we can expect a significant chance to form emp or metal - free stars from pristine materials kept until @xmath10 @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "our argument of the discovery of emp or metal - free stars at @xmath10 is consistent with recent studies of igm metal enrichment .",
    "the laes which may contain primordial stars reside in a massive proto - cluster region , ssa22 field @xcite .",
    "this field is very peculiar in an enhanced activity of laes / labs ( m04 ) , dusty sub - mm galaxies @xcite , and agns @xcite .",
    "such activities may proceed igm metal enrichment efficiently by metal - rich outflows which are observed ubiquitously around lbgs @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the laes clustering in this field is very low @xcite and this indicates that the laes do not lie in the high density peak of the proto - cluster but in the less dense periphery of the large - scale filaments @xcite .",
    "the metal enrichment may not proceed well yet there .",
    "however , the exact three - dimensional distribution of the laes and other types of galaxies by spectroscopy is not obtained yet and is an interesting future work .",
    "the existence of massive emp or pop iii stars in laes may have an impact on the studies of ionizing background and reionization .",
    "based on the observed cosmic evolution of ionizing background , @xcite have suggested higher lyc emissivity ( or escape fraction ) of galaxies at higher-@xmath25 . such an evolving lyc emissivity is supported by galactic lyc observations @xcite and simulations @xcite and is favourable for the cosmic reionization @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical mechanism of the evolving lyc emissivity is still uncertain .",
    "some radiative transfer simulations suggest that less massive galaxies have larger escape fraction of lyc @xcite . @xcite",
    "have found a possible luminosity dependence of the lyc emissivity from a large lbg sample .",
    "if such less massive galaxies are common at higher-@xmath25 , the global lyc emissivity becomes larger at higher-@xmath25 .",
    "another possibility is that galaxies at higher-@xmath25 have a higher mass fraction of massive emp or pop iii stars and their lyc emissivity is intrinsically higher . in  5.5 ,",
    "we have found that more than an order of magnitude larger primordial mass fraction in the laes ( 110% ) than the lbgs ( 0.1% ) .",
    "if this larger primordial mass fraction is true for general laes and the lae population is more common at higher-@xmath25 as found by @xcite , the galactic lyc emissivity becomes higher at higher-@xmath25 .",
    "of course , these two scenarios can be combined : the less massive lae population has larger intrinsic lyc emissivity due to primordial stars and larger escape fraction .",
    "indeed , to make a strong lyman ` bump ' , we need a large escape fraction of @xmath56 ( paper i ) . therefore , such less massive lyman bump galaxies may play a significant role in the cosmic reionization at @xmath11 .",
