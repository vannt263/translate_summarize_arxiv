    ", the star collaboration has been studying mid - rapidity inclusive jet production in @xmath0 = 200 gev @xmath2 collisions in order to constrain the gluon contribution to the proton spin .",
    "we find that the cross section for inclusive jet production is well described by next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd predictions for jet transverse momenta ( @xmath6 ) spanning the range 5 to 50 gev / c @xcite .",
    "our first measurements of the longitudinal double - spin asymmetry , @xmath7 , for inclusive jet production @xcite , based on data that were recorded during the 2003 and 2004 rhic runs , disfavored a maximal gluon polarization scenario where the gluon polarization distribution , @xmath8 , at the input scale , @xmath9 = 0.4 gev@xmath10 , is assumed to be equal to the unpolarized gluon distribution , @xmath11 .    here , we describe measurements of @xmath7 for inclusive jet production that were performed by star during the 2005 @xcite and 2006 rhic runs .",

    "jets are reconstructed using a mid - point cone algorithm , as described in @xcite . in 2005 ,",
    "the bemc covered a pseudorapidity range @xmath13 , and eemc information was not considered in the jet reconstruction . to minimize the effects of the bemc acceptance on the jet energy scale",

    "the bemc covered @xmath15 , and the eemc information was included in the jet reconstruction .",
    "these changes permitted the cone radius to be increased to @xmath16 , thereby increasing the jet reconstruction efficiency and decreasing the reconstruction biases .",
    "the allowed range for the jet axis was expanded to @xmath17 .",
    "events were recorded if they satisfied either a high tower ( a minimum energy deposition in a @xmath18 tower ) or jet patch ( a minimum energy deposition over a @xmath19 region ) trigger .",
    "most of the events for 2005 , and all of the events presented here for 2006 , were derived from the jet patch trigger .",
    "the polarizations of the beams were determined from measurements of @xmath20+c coulomb - nuclear interference @xcite calibrated via a polarized atomic hydrogen gas - jet target @xcite .",

    "relative luminosities for the various spin states were measured with beam - beam counters located up and downstream of the star interaction region .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainties in the @xmath7 measurements arise from trigger and reconstruction biases .",

    "the increased acceptance of the star detector in 2006 , combined with increases in the integrated luminosity and beam polarization , lead to statistical uncertainties that are a factor of 3 - 4 times smaller for @xmath26 gev / c than in the 2005 data .",

    "inclusive jet asymmetries at any given @xmath6 provide sensitivity to gluon polarization over a broad range of @xmath24 values , as illustrated in @xcite .",

    "the momentum fractions of the incident partons can be calculated from the mass , @xmath32 , and rapidity , @xmath33 , of the di - jet via @xmath34 .",
    "the large acceptance of the star detector provides the additional benefit that the di - jet kinematics can be chosen to emphasize the scattering of low-@xmath24 gluons by highly polarized valence quarks .",
    "figure [ fig:09 ] shows the expected precision of the star di - jet measurements during the upcoming rhic run .",
    "the four panels provide a rough separation of the events according to di - jet rapidity and partonic scattering angle .",

    "the bands show full nlo calculations of the predicted asymmetries for grsv - std and dssv .",
    "the power of these measurements can be illustrated by considering the first three data points of the lower - left panel .",
    "they will determine @xmath37 to approximately @xmath380.02 - 0.03 in three @xmath24 bins centered at 0.076 , 0.10 , and 0.13 .",
    "the first three points in the upper - left panel will also sample @xmath37 at the same three @xmath24 values , but with somewhat reduced precision .",
    "overall , this measurement will determine @xmath1 over the range @xmath39 .",
    "in the further future , star will study inclusive jet and di - jet production in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath0 = 500 gev , which will expand the kinematic reach to even lower-@xmath24 gluons .",
