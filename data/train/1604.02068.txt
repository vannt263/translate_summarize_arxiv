    "in recent days , ordered patterns in nanometer(nm ) range on semiconductor surface has been pursuing immense technological applications in semiconductor devices , optoelectronics , spintronics etc @xcite .",
    "large scale fabrication of such nanopatterns with simultaneous control on their purity and uniformity demand a cost - effective and reproducible technique . in this respect ,",
    "low energy ion beam sputtering ( ibs ) is known to be a promising method among other top - down and bottom - up approaches of nanostructurin @xcite .",
    "depending on ion incidence angle , ibs can induce different nanoscale topographies , like one dimensional ripples ( oblique incidence ) , two dimensional dots ( normal incidence ) , cones or needle shaped structures ( grazing incidence ) etc .",
    "within very short time on a wide range of substrates in just one step i.e. , simple exposure to ion beam .",
    "the patterns by ibs is thought to be generated by self - organization between curvature dependent ion erosion and diffusion based surface relaxations @xcite .",
    "depending on ion incidence angle , the wave - vector of ripples can appear in either parallel or perpendicular direction of ion beam projection and those are generally addressed as ( i ) parallel ( observed in the range of incidence angle 45@xmath0- 65@xmath0 ) and ( ii ) perpendicular mode ( observed in the range of incidence angle 80@xmath0 - 85@xmath0 ) ripples respectively @xcite .",
    "capability of ibs technique of nanopatterning fall short in application perspective due to upper surface amorphization of nanostructures .",
    "to get rid of this amorphization , sputtering at elevated substrate temperature can be a key factor .",
    "thus , the studies on temperature induced morphological evolution during ibs is important from technological point of view .",
    "this study is also important for theoretical understanding as well because the complete understanding of pattern formation mechanism is still not clear .",
    "recently , it has been shown by madi et .",
    "al . that mass redistribution of surface adatoms plays dominant role in pattern formation mechanism rather than the curvature dependent ion erosion , especially in low energy ( @xmath71kev ) regime of ion sputtering @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface relaxation mechanisms involved in pattern evolution process can be of different types like thermally induced surface diffusion @xcite , ion induced surface diffusion @xcite , ion - enhanced viscous flow relaxation @xcite etc . and among them which one would be dominating depends on experimental parameters substrate temperature and ion flux .",
    "thus , the studies of surface morphological behaviour as function of different ion processing parameters like substrate temperature , ion sputtering time , ion energy , ion current density etc . helps to get a deeper understanding of pattern formation mechanism during ibs as well as it also helps to improve the control of ibs techniques in fabrication of well - ordered patterns .",

    "the first breakthrough in understanding the evolution of ripple morphology and its dependence on different ion beam processing parameters like substrate temperature , ion energy and ion current density was achieved by bradley & harper ( bh ) together and what they proposed is usually known as linear bradley - harper ( bh ) theory @xcite .",
    "based on sigmund s theory @xcite , bradley & harper considers the surface patterning due to ibs is a balance of surface instability arising due to a self - organization process between curvature dependent ion erosion which results in surface roughening and surface relaxation processes which makes the surface smooth @xcite . later on , to explain the coarsening in ripple wavelength and saturation of ripple amplitude at higher ion fluences , cuerno and barabasi had extended the bh theory where they introduced some non - linear terms which accounts the tilt dependency of sputtering yield @xcite .",

    "al based on carter - vishnyakov effect @xcite showed that the ballistic mass redistrubution originating from the diffusion of sputter induced near surface adatoms are dominating over curvature dependent ion erosion @xcite .",
