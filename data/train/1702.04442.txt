    "geometrical frustration plays a central role in the understanding of quantum magnetism @xcite .",
    "the distinction between bipartite and geometrically frustrated lattices is fundamental for spin - models of localized electrons .",
    "but , we will argue below , in itinerant electron systems the bipartite / geometrically frustrated distinction is not relevant .",
    "rather a topological definition of frustration is required .",
    "we will argue below that structural balance , introduced in an anthropological context , where one is often concerned with networks containing both beneficial and antagonistic relationships , @xcite , provides an appropriate measure of topological frustration .",
    "previous attempts to classify the frustration of itinerant electrons have focused on the reduced bandwidth in frustrated systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , these measures miss the fundamental role that the sign of the hopping integral plays in frustrated itinerant electron systems .",
    "balance considers this .    to ground the above claims we study one of the few exact results of strongly correlated itinerant electrons : nagaoka s theorem .",
    "this theorem concerns the properties of the infinite-@xmath0 hubbard model  however , here we consider a larger class of hamiltonians , which allows for arbitrary two - orbital interactions : @xmath1 where    @xmath2",
    "@xmath3    @xmath4 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath5 on the @xmath6th wannier orbital centered on site @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the vector of pauli matrices . here",
    "@xmath13 is the amplitude for hopping between the @xmath6th orbital on site @xmath7 and the @xmath14th orbital on site @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath0 is the effective coulomb interaction between two electrons on the same orbital , @xmath16 is any potential that depends only on the orbital occupation numbers ",
    "obviously this includes arbitrary pairwise direct coulomb interaction : @xmath17 ; but in fact the proofs below hold for arbitrary terms of this form , including multi - site interactions , the @xmath18 are the exchange couplings , the @xmath19 are pair hopping amplitudes , and the @xmath20 are correlated hopping amplitudes .",
    "note that no assumption about the intra - site hopping has been made , in particular @xmath21 may be non - zero . to discuss the literature it is convenient to differentiate between four versions of this model : ( a ) the multiorbital model  eq .",
    "( [ eq : full ] ) ; ( b ) the single orbital model  one orbital per site ( henceforth we drop the orbital subscripts when discussing single orbital models ) ( c ) the extended hubbard model  the single orbital model with @xmath22 for all @xmath23 ; and ( d ) the hubbard model  the extended hubbard model with the additional constraint that @xmath24 .    note that the hole doped sector of each of these models ( @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of electrons and @xmath27 is the number of orbitals on the entire lattice ) is equivalent to the electron sector of that model ( @xmath28 ) with the signs of all @xmath13 reversed .",
    "a particle - hole transformation maps between the hamiltonians , up to constants , even in the absence of particle - hole symmetry .",
    "henceforth we will only discuss the hole doped problem ; however it is implicit throughout that all results hold for the electron doped problem if the signs of all @xmath13 reversed .",
    "nagaoka showed @xcite that in the nagaoka limit ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) the ground state of the hubbard model on certain lattices is a fully polarized ferromagnet ",
    "i.e. , the magnetization , @xmath31 .",
    "nagaoka showed that for nearest neighbor hopping only ( @xmath32 for nearest neighbors , @xmath33 otherwise ) and @xmath34 @xcite this result holds for simple cubic , body centered cubic , face centered cubic and hexagonal close packed lattices .",
    "however , for @xmath35 nagaoka found that the theorem holds on the simple cubic and body centered cubic lattices , but not for the face centered cubic or hexagonal close packed lattices .",
    "the former lattices are bipartite , while the latter are not .    in 1989",
    "tasaki gave a more general proof of nagaoka s theorem @xcite .",
    "specifically , tasaki proved that nagaoka s theorem holds for the extended hubbard model on all lattices where @xmath36 for all @xmath37 .",
    "as nagaoka had already given two examples of lattices with all @xmath38 where his theorem holds it is obvious that tasaki s condition is sufficient but not necessary .",
    "thus , one is moved to ask which other hamiltonians with some or all @xmath39 have ferromagnetic ground states ?",
    "this is particularly important as for a simple covalent bonds one expects that @xmath39 @xcite .    in 1996",
    "kollar , strack and vollhardt @xcite extend nagaoka s theorem in a different direction .",
    "they showed that it held for the single orbital model on periodic lattices if the hopping and all interactions are constrained to be between nearest neighbors only , exchange is ferromagnetic ( or zero ) , and either @xmath34 or the lattice is bipartite .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask what other ( e.g. , longer range ) two - orbital interactions admit that a proof of nagaoka s theorem ?",
    "furthermore , given that ferromagnetism is observed in many materials where multiple orbitals are relevant to the low - energy physics it is natural to ask whether multiple orbital models exhibit nagaoka - like ferromagnetism .",
    "below , we give partial answers to the above questions by proving the following :    _ theorem 1 _ : consider the multiorbital model ( [ eq : full ] ) with @xmath0 infinite , @xmath40 and @xmath41 arbitrary , @xmath42 for all @xmath23 and @xmath30 . if the signed graph @xmath43 defined by the set of renormalized hopping integrals @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , is balanced ( defined below ) then among the ground states there exist at least @xmath27 states with @xmath46 .    _ theorem 2 _ : consider the multiorbital model ( [ eq : full ] ) with @xmath0 infinite , @xmath40 and @xmath41 arbitrary , @xmath42 for all @xmath23 and @xmath30 . if the signed graph @xmath43 defined by the set of renormalized hopping integrals @xmath44 is balanced and @xmath47 satisfies the connectivity condition ( defined below ) then the ground state has @xmath46 and is unique up to the trivial @xmath26-fold degeneracy .",
    "the remainder of the paper is laid out as follows .",
    "having introduced balanced and unbalanced lattices in section [ sect : balance ] , we prove that balance is a sufficient condition for the proof of nagaoka s theorem in the nagaoka limit ( section [ sect : sufficient ] ) .",
    "all of the lattices for which nagaoka , tasaki or kollar _",
    "et al_.proved nagaoka s theorem previously are balanced .",
    "in section [ sect : necessary ] , we give a simple example that demonstrates that balance is not necessary for the ground state of the hubbard model in the nagaoka limit to be a fully polarized ferromagnet .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : orbital ] we provide a simple recipe for obtaining the orbital part of the wavefunction .",
    "the sign of the hopping between a pair of orbitals , @xmath48 , is always ill defined .",
    "the gauge transformation @xmath49 takes @xmath50 .",
    "nevertheless information is contained in the signs of the set @xmath44 associated with a particular hamiltonian .",
    "this is a topological problem  the magnitudes of the @xmath48 are unimportant ; only their signs matter .",
    "thus , rather than considering every @xmath44 separately , it is sufficient to instead study a related ` signed graph ' .",
    "we define this signed graph as follows : we introduce a vertex of the graph corresponding to each orbital in the physical hamiltonian , @xmath51 ( throughout this paper we use latin characters for sites in the hamiltonian , greek for orbitals , and hebrew for vertices in the signed graph ) .",
    "furthermore , we introduce a set of edges defined by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 if and only if @xmath54 .",
    "we now ask whether there exists a series of gauge transformations that make all the @xmath55 ?",
    "if so , the gauge transformation makes all of the @xmath56     [ @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 and dashed lines indicate @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "( a ) a balanced lattice .",
    "( b ) as ( a ) with a choice of the subsets @xmath62 and @xmath63 indicated by the shading of the vertices .",
    "( c ) an unbalanced lattice : the path @xmath64 is negative ( @xmath65).,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 and dashed lines indicate @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",

    "a walk in which all the sites that are visited are distinct ( i.e. , a self avoiding walk ) is called a _ path_. a path that visits at least three sites and is closed ( e.g. , @xmath67 , in the example above ) is called a _ cycle_. the sign of a path or cycle on a signed graph is defined as the product of signs @xmath68 ) of the edges forming the path / cycle .",
    "thus every positive cycle has an even number ( including zero ) of negative edges .",
    "a signed graph is _ balanced _ if all cycles in the corresponding signed graph are positive , cf .",
    ". we will call a hamiltonian balanced if it maps onto a balanced signed graph .    the fundamental theorem of signed graphs @xcite states that for a signed graph , @xmath69",
    ", the following three conditions are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath69 is balanced , i.e. , all cycles within @xmath69 are positive .",
    "2 .   for any pair of vertices @xmath70 and @xmath71 in @xmath69",
    "all paths joining @xmath70 and @xmath71 have the same sign .",
    "3 .   there exists a partition of @xmath72 into two subsets , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , ( one of which may be empty ) such that @xmath73 for all @xmath70 and @xmath71 within the same subset , but @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "[ 2sets ]    thus , for example , all bipartite lattices with only nearest neighbor hopping are balanced .",
    "in the nagaoka limit all states with finite energy can be written as a superposition of ` single hole states ' of the form @xmath77 is a binary vector describing the spins of all of the electrons , @xmath78 is the vacuum state defined by @xmath79 for all @xmath7 , @xmath6 , @xmath5 , and @xmath80 $ ] is an arbitrary ordering of the orbitals . @xmath81",
    "need have no correlation to the physical patten of the lattice , but is required to enforce the correct antisymmetrization of the hole states  the operators in the product are to be ordered by @xmath81 with lower values to the left .",
    "we describe two states as ` directly connected ' if @xmath82 .",
    "we will denote direct connection by @xmath83 .",
    "for directly connected states @xmath84    a hamiltonian is said to satisfy the connectivity condition if there exists an integer @xmath85 for which @xmath86 for every pair of states with the same @xmath87 .",
    "notably , one dimensional single orbital models with only nearest neighbor hopping are not connected in this sense @xcite",
    ".      we will compare the arbitrary superposition of states of single hole states @xmath88 indicates that all the electrons are up and @xmath89 .",
    "we have    @xmath90    that is , the infinite-@xmath0 and the fact that @xmath91 only depends on the site occupation numbers mean that @xmath92 is independent of the spin degrees of freedom for single hole states .",
    "now note that @xmath93 for all @xmath94 .",
    "thus , if @xmath42 for all @xmath23 then @xmath95 for all @xmath96 . therefore , @xmath97 where the second inequality follows from the cauchy - schwartz inequality .    because double occupancy is forbidden in the infinite-@xmath0 limit @xmath98 .",
    "finally , we specialize to the case of a balanced lattice .",
    "property [ 2sets ] of the fundamental theorem of signed graphs implies that we can construct a gauge transformation that maps the hamiltonian onto one where all @xmath56 .",
    "an explicit example of such a gauge transformation is @xmath99    furthermore , @xmath100 where we have again made use of the cauchy - schwartz inequality and @xmath101 indicates that the sum is restricted to run only over @xmath102 and @xmath103 such that @xmath83 , as the overlap integral vanished otherwise .",
    "thus , there are no states with energy lower than @xmath104 .",
    "theorem 1 follows immediately from the so(3 ) symmetry of the model .",
    "@xmath105      the perron",
    " frobenius theorem @xcite states ( among other things ) that if all the elements of an irreducible real square matrix are non - negative then it has a unique largest real eigenvalue and that the corresponding eigenvector has strictly positive components .",
    "a hermitian matrix is reducible if and only if it can be block diagonalized by a permutation matrix .",
    "let use write the hamiltonian ( [ eq : full ] ) in the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 labels the @xmath108-component of the total spin of the system .",
    "each of the @xmath26 matrices @xmath109 is irreducible provided the hamiltonian satisfies the connectivity condition .",
    "furthermore , we have seen above that all of the matrix elements of @xmath110 .",
    "therefore each of the @xmath111 satisfy the perron  frobenius theorem .",
    "the so(3 ) symmetry of the hamiltonian means that @xmath104 must be @xmath26-fold degenerate . as no states have lower energy than @xmath104 this means that the lowest energy states of the @xmath112-sectors are necessarily degenerate and that , up to this required @xmath26-fold degeneracy",
    ", @xmath104 is unique .",
    "here we require only an example .",
    "one is provided by the hubbard model on a square cluster with both nearest neighbor and next - nearest neighbor hopping : @xmath113 where addition in the subscripts is defined modulo four .",
    "this hamiltonian is only balanced if @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "for infinite-@xmath0 this model is straightforward to solve by direct means . for @xmath116 and @xmath117 the nagaoka state , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gs - holes ] ) with all @xmath118 in the gauge in which the hamiltonian is written above , remains the unique ground state ( up to the trivial four - fold spin degeneracy ) for @xmath119 .",
    "it is not entirely surprising that such examples should exist : it is known that their exist some matrices with some negative elements for which the dominant eigenvector is non - negative and corresponds to a positive eigenvector @xcite .",
    "this model also provides examples of fully polarized states that are not unique ( away from level crossings ) . for @xmath120 ,",
    "the ground state again has @xmath121 , but it has an additional two - fold orbital degeneracy .",
    "the wavefunctions of the @xmath122 members of these quadruplets are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gs - holes ] ) .",
    "all of the @xmath123 can be made positive by a gauge transformation of @xmath124 on two adjacent sites , which renders @xmath125 ( and hence makes a pair opposite sides of the square have negative hopping integrals , i.e. , @xmath126 ) .",
    "however , the degeneracy of the states means that one can choose some of the @xmath127 for each degenerate wavefunction .",
    "although the perron  frobenius theorem implies that all of the @xmath118 , one would like to have a general form of the ground state wavefunction . of course one could simply take eq .",
    "( [ eq : gs - holes ] ) as a variational wavefunction and minimize all of the @xmath123 .",
    "however , for @xmath128 for all @xmath23 a more elegant approach is to introduce an ancillary model of non - interacting spinless fermions on the same lattice : @xmath129 and then make a particle - hole transformation @xmath130 , which yields @xmath131 as this is a single particle hamiltonian the ground state can be written in the form @xmath132 , is the state for which @xmath133 for all @xmath134 .",
    "we now note that @xmath135 and @xmath136 , where the ordering of the operators in the products is as as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : holes ] ) .",
    "for the single hole states @xmath137 and we have seen above that @xmath138 does not affect the ground state wavefunction as it just results in a constant energy offset for single hole states .",
    "recalling eqs .",
    "( [ eq : expect_tx ] ) and ( [ eq : gs - holes ] ) one finds that @xmath139 for all @xmath7 , which means that we can calculate the ground state wavefunction of the multiorbital model without exchange from the ancillary non - interaction model .",
    "often , directly minimizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : non - int ] ) is not the most efficient approach , for example , if the lattice is periodic a fourier transformation leads directly to the solution .",
    "finally , we note that if the connectivity condition holds the perron - frobenius theorem guarantees the existence of a gauge for which all @xmath123 are strictly positive . note that",
    ", in a periodic system , it always possible to construct a wavefunction that is strictly positive at high symmetry points with wavevectors , @xmath140 , satisfying @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the set of all such high symmetry points always includes the @xmath143-point ( origin of the unit cell ) .",
    "we have shown that structural balance and the absence of antiferromagnetic exchange are sufficient to prove that the ground state of infinite-@xmath0 multiorbital model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : full ] ) , with arbitrary pairwise interactions in ferromagnetic .",
    "nevertheless balance is not necessary for a ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "structural balance implies the absence of topological frustration ",
    "therefore , for itinerant electrons , balance is the natural definition of an unfrustrated lattice . while bipartite lattices ( with no hopping within the sublattices ) are always balanced , many non - bipartite lattices are also balanced , e.g. , the triangular and kagaome lattices with @xmath34 . an interesting question , beyond the scope of this paper , is the role of structural balance to other problems involving frustration and itinerant electrons .",
    "we also demonstrated that , in the absence of exchange interactions , the orbital part of the ground state can be calculated by mapping the problem onto a model of non - interacting spinless fermions .",
    "this is consistent with the general insight that nagaoka s theorem arises from the minimization of the hole s kinetic energy .",
