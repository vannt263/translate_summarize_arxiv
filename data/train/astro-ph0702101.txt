    "quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are thought to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "the accretion flow onto the black hole is thought to proceed via an equatorial accretion disk , which provides a mechanism for removing the angular momentum of the infalling matter .",
    "outflows ( winds ) from such disks appear to be an inseparable part of this process .",
    "more specifically , hydromagnetic winds ( e.g. , blandford & payne 1982 ; emmering , blandford & shlosman 1992 ; konigl & kartje 1994 ; everett 2005 ) provide a potential mechanism for extracting angular momentum from the accreting material , thus allowing accretion to proceed .",
    "accretion disk winds are likely to be responsible for the broad absorption lines ( bals ) observed in the spectra of a fraction of quasars ( e.g. , murray et al .",
    "1995 ; arav , li , & begelman 1994 , proga , stone , & kallman 2000 ) and may even be the source of the broad emission lines that are the hallmark of all quasars and agns ( e.g. , chiang & murray 1996 ; murray & chiang 1997 ) . understanding the quasar outflow mechanisms by testing and refining theoretical models is therefore an essential part of our quest to understand the central engines of agns and quasars .",
    "quasar outflows also have quite important consequences for cosmology and galaxy formation and evolution because they provide energy and momentum feedback to the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy and to the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "simulations of galaxy evolution through mergers ( springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ) show that agn feedback heats the ism and inhibits star formation .",
    "thus the colors of the resulting galaxies evolve very quickly to the red , in agreement with the observed color distribution of nearby galaxies . in semi - analytic models of galaxy assembly",
    "( granato et al . 2004 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ) agn feedback expells dense gas from the centers of the host galaxies , heating up the igm ( which it also enriches with metals ) .",
    "because of its low density , the igm does not cool efficiently and as a result it can not fall back onto the galaxy and fuel star formation . thus feedback brings about an early termination of the assembly of the host galaxy . in this context",
    "it is quite important to know the fraction of quasars driving energetic outflows , as well as the energy content of the outflow .",
    "the latter quantity can be determined from the velocity , column density , and global covering factor of the outflowing gas .",
    "all of these parameters are intimately connected to dynamical models of accretion disk winds and constraining them observationally can hardly be overemphasized . moreover",
    ", the outflowing material may provide a mechanism for enriching the igm with metals .",
    "this idea is made more attractive by recent results that suggest high metallicities in quasar outflows ( e.g. , hamann et al .",
    "1997 ; gabel et al . 2006 ; petitjean et al . 1994 ; tripp et al . 1996 ; dodorico et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this question is closely connected to the issues above since the outflow rates and metallicities of quasar winds are at the heart of the matter .    in the models cited above",
    ", the outflow is accelerated by either magnetocentrifugal forces , or by radiation pressure in lines and continuum , or by a combination of the two processes .",
    "the flow originates deep inside the potential well of the black hole and can reach terminal speeds of order @xmath1 or higher .",
    "the geometry of the flow differs between a purely radiation - driven and a purely magnetocentrifugal wind . in the former case , ( and especially at high luminosities ) the flow is largely confined to low latitudes and effectively `` hugs '' the accretion disk . in addition , the numerical simulations of proga et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that the region above the fast , low - latitude stream develops transient filaments and streams which are denser than the ambient medium .",
    "in contrast , in the latter case the flow is nearly cylindrical ( or u - shaped ) and appears somewhat collimated at large radii from the black hole ( see , for example , the illustrations in blandford & payne 1982 and konigl & kartje 1994 ) .",
    "however , the density of the flow drops sharply once the gas has traveled a distance of a few launch radii , with the consequence that the dense part of the flow is concentrated near the equatorial plane ( e.g. , everett 2005 ) .",
    "a hybrid model , in which radiation pressure and magnetocentrifugal forces are combined , also leads to a similar geometry ( everett 2005 ) .",
    "one may expect by analogy with radiation pressure - driven winds that the higher - latitude , lower - density regions of these winds would also contain transient , dense filaments or streams .",
    "thus the _ apparent _ geometry and kinematics of the flows resulting from these two acceleration mechanisms are fairly similar .",
    "a different family of outflow models includes pressure - driven winds ( e.g. , balsara & krolik 1993 ; krolik & kriss 1995 , 2001 ; chelouche & netzer 2005 ) .",
    "these are made up of gas that is photo - evaporated from the cool , dense torus that is invoked in agn unification schemes .",
    "thus , the flow originates not very deep inside the black hole potential well and the outflow speed is of order @xmath2 .",
    "the outflow is expected to have a multi - temperature and multi - density structure and indeed it would be clumpy .",
    "the primary difference between this type of model and the accretion - disk wind models described above is the terminal speed of the flow .",
    "blueshifted ( or `` p - cygni '' ) absorption lines provide a direct probe of quasar accretion disk winds .",
    "bals ( widths @xmath3  , by definition ) have been the traditional means of studying such winds because they can be readily associated with them .",
    "this association is motivated by their large widths ( often corresponding to velocity spreads of 30,000  ) and their smooth profiles . however",
    ", intrinsic narrow absorption lines ( intrinsic nals ; widths up to 500  ; see review by hamman & sabra 2004 ) that are physically related to the quasars are an alternative and very useful means of studying such outflows . intrinsic ( most often blueshifted ) nals are detected in a significant fraction ( 2550% ) of quasar spectra .",
    "these correspond to uv resonance transitions in highly ionized ions , such as and ( e.g. , foltz et al 1986 , hereafter f86 ; sargent , steidel , & boksenberg 1989 ; anderson et al .",
    "1987 ; young , sargent , & boksenberg 1982 ; steidel & sargent 1991 ; ganguly et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter g01 ; vestergaard 2003 ) .",
    "quasar spectra also host an intermediate class of absorption lines , mini - bals ( widths between 500 and 2,000  , see hamann & sabra 2004 ) , whose widths and smooth profiles also suggest an origin in outflows .",
    "such absorption lines are also found in seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. , crenshaw , maran , & mushotzky 1998 ; crenshaw et al .",
    "2004 ; scott et al .",
    "studies of intrinsic nals and mini - bals are more promising than studies of bals for two important reasons : first these lines do not suffer from self - blending , and second , they are found in a wider variety of active galactic nuclei , and with greater ubiquity . in the context of the models described above , intrinsic nal may probe the dense , cool filaments embedded in a hotter outflow .",
    "thus they may give us access to a different portion , a different phase , or a different line of sight through the outflow than the bals .",
    "in spite of their potential importance , nals have not received as much attention as bals .",
    "thus , we know surprisingly little about the relation between intrinsic nals , mini - bals , and bals , and their connection , if any to the properties of the broad emission - lines .",
    "this is because it is difficult to distinguish intrinsic nals from nals that are not physically related to the quasars ( intervening nals ) , produced in intervening galaxies , intergalactic clouds , milky way gas or gas in the host galaxies of the quasars .",
    "it has been traditionally thought that nals that fall within 5,000  of quasar emission redshifts ( termed _ associated _ absorption lines or aals ) are physically associated with the quasars , because their frequency per unit velocity increases with decreasing velocity offset from the quasar ( e.g. , weymann et al .",
    "aals are common in all types of quasars , although the strongest ones appear preferentially in radio - loud quasar spectra ( f86 ; anderson et al . 1987 ) .",
    "the statistical analysis of richards et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and richards ( 2001 ) suggested that a fraction of 36% of the nals with blueshifts from 5,000 to 65,000  from a quasar may also be physically associated with it .    over the past decade , with the advent of high - dispersion spectroscopy of faint objects , it has become possible to identify individual intrinsic nals , based primarily on one or both of the following indicators : ( a ) the dilution of absorption troughs by unocculted light ( e.g. , hamann et al .",

    "these data allow us to construct a large , and relatively unbiased , sample of intrinsic nals . using this sample",

    "the quasars in our sample were originally selected and observed in a survey aimed at measuring the deuterium - to - hydrogen abundance ratio ( d / h ) in the ly@xmath9  forest .",
    "the typical value of d / h is so small , 2@xmath10 ( omeara et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) , that we can detect only lines corresponding to h  i  lines with large column densities , @xmath11(@xmath12/@xmath13 ) @xmath14 .",
    "therefore the survey included 40 quasars , in which either damped ly@xmath9(dla ) systems or strong lyman limit systems ( llss ) were detected .",

    "we use the spectra of 37 of these quasars , listed in table  [ tab : quasars ] , which cover the rest - frame wavelength range between the ly@xmath9  and lines .",
    "this target selection method does not directly bias our sample with respect to the properties of any _ intrinsic _ absorption - line systems that these spectra may contain .",
    "however , an indirect bias could result since the sample contains only quasars bright enough to allow high @xmath16 , high resolution observations .",
    "although , optical brightness does not appear to be the most significant factor in determining whether a quasar hosts a nal , it is likely to have some effect ( g01 ) . also , there is a somewhat enhanced probability of finding associated nals in quasars that host bals ( g01 ) , thus the avoidance of bal quasars in our sample may bias against intrinsic nals .",

    "quasar emission redshifts were obtained from a variety of sources in the literature and they are based primarily on measurements of the peaks of their strong , broad uv emission lines , namely ly@xmath9 , and .",
    "it is well known that the redshift determined from these particular lines is systematically different from the redshift of the low - ionization lines ( i.e. , and the balmer lines ) and the systemic redshift , as given by the narrow , forbidden lines ( see , for example , corbin 1990 ; tytler & fan 1992 ; brotherton et al .",
    "1994 ; sulentic et al . 1995 ; marziani et al .",
    "even though redshift differences can reach @xmath17 , in most cases they are within @xmath18 . in radio - quiet quasars , there is a systematic tendency for the line to be _ blueshifted _ relative to the systemic redshift .",
    "most relevant to this work are the results of tytler & fan ( 1992 ) who study the redshift discrepancies of the uv lines in quasars of comparable redshifts and luminosities to those of our sample .",
    "they find a mean blueshift of the uv lines relative to the systemic redshift of 260  and that 90% of the blueshifts are between 0 and 650  ( see their figure  13 ) .",
    "we also list in table  [ tab : quasars ] a measure of the radio - loudness of the quasars in our sample , the ratio of the flux densities at 5  ghz and 4400   , i.e. , @xmath19 ( following kellermann et al .",

    "the optical depth ratio of doublet lines , such as , , or , , sometimes deviates from the value of 2:1 expected from atomic physics .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained if the absorber covers the background flux source only partially , and the unabsorbed flux changes the relative depth of the lines ( e.g. , wampler et al .",
    "1995 ; barlow & sargent 1997 ; hamann et al .",
    "1997a ; g99 ) . however , there are other possible explanations , such as local emission by the absorbers ( wampler , chugai , & petitjean 1995 ) and scattering of background photons into our line of sight ( g99 ) .",
    "we assume the simplest model , in which the absorber has a constant optical depth across the projected area ( i.e. , a homogeneous model ) .",
    "then , the observed intensity as a function of velocity from the line center in the _ normalized _ spectrum is given by @xmath68\\ ; ,    \\label{eqn : normint}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the fraction of background light occulted by the absorber ( hereafter , the `` coverage fraction '' ) , and @xmath70 is the optical depth at velocity @xmath71 . if a nal system consists of many kinematic components ( the most common case ) , these are combined by multiplying the individual voigt profiles after making the appropriate adjustments for partial coverage , following equation  ( [ eqn : normint ] ) .",
    "thus we describe the final _ normalized _ residual intensity by the product @xmath72 ,    \\label{eqn : product}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath73 labels different kinematic components .",
    "this assumption is quite safe if the components do not overlap significantly in velocity , and is still a good approximation if one component dominates at each wavelength .",
    "if we measure the optical depth ratio of doublet lines with oscillator strength values of 2:1 ( e.g. , , , and ) by fitting their profiles , we can evaluate the coverage fraction as a function of velocity across the line profile as @xmath74^{2}}{1+r_b(v)-2r_r(v ) } ,    \\label{eqn : cf}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the continuum normalized intensities of the weaker ( redder ) and stronger ( bluer ) members of the doublet ( see , for example , barlow & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "g99 refined this technique by considering two background sources : the continuum source and the broad emission line region ( hereafter belr ) . in this composite picture",
    "the total coverage fraction can be expressed as a weighted average of the coverage fractions of the two regions , namely , @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the coverage fractions of the continuum source and the broad emission line region , and @xmath80 is the ratio of the broad line flux to the continuum flux at a given pixel in the absorption - line profile .",
    "it is quite possible for the absorber to have different optical depths along different paths ( i.e. , an inhomogeneous model ; dekool , korista , & arav 2002 ) .",
    "nonetheless , by exploring this inhomogeneous model , sabra & hamann ( 2005 ) found that the average optical depths derived from homogeneous and inhomogeneous models are consistent with each other within a factor of @xmath811.5 , unless a small fraction of the projected area of the absorber has a very large optical depth .",
    "moreover , in most cases , one can find acceptable fits to the absorption profile using a simple combination of just a few voigt components .",
    "therefore , we adopt the homogeneous optical depth model , as described by equation  ( [ eqn : cf ] ) , with the understanding that @xmath82 describes the fraction of _ all _ background photons that pass through the absorber .",
    "we consider the composite picture described by equation  ( [ eqn : wcf ] ) , only if it critically affects our conclusions .",
    "we use two methods to evaluate ; ( i ) the _ pixel - by - pixel _ method ( e.g. , g99 ) , in which we apply equation  ( [ eqn : cf ] ) to each pixel in the normalized spectrum , and ( ii ) the _ fitting method _ ( e.g. , ganguly et al . 2003 ) in which we fit the absorption profiles using minfit , treating @xmath83 as well as @xmath84 , @xmath54 , and @xmath66 as a free parameter . in the former case we obtain a value of  for each pixel in the line profile , while in the latter case we obtain a value of  for each kinematic ( voigt ) component .",
    "our derived  values are subject to a number of additional uncertainties resulting from line blending , uncertainties in the continuum fit , the convolution of the spectrum with the line spread function ( lsf ) of the spectrograph ( g99 ; only applies to the pixel - by - pixel method ) , and poisson errors in regions with weak lines ( only applies to the fitting method ) .",
    "the methodology for assessing these uncertainties was developed in m05 with the help of extensive simulations .",
    "we do not use spectral regions that are strongly affected by these uncertainties , and we consider these sources of error when evaluating whether  deviates from unity , as described below .",
    "the  values evaluated by both of the above methods are overplotted on the observed spectrum of each doublet shown in figure  [ fig : pcovplots ] of the appendix .",
    "the minfit routine sometimes gives unphysical coverage fractions such as @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "tests by m05 showed that coverage fractions produced by minfit are very sensitive to continuum level errors , especially for very weak components whose  values are close to 1 , which suggests a cause for these unphysical results . in such cases , other fit parameters , such as the column density and doppler parameter ,",
    "have no physical meaning .",
    "therefore we re - evaluate them assuming @xmath87 ( with no error bar ) for those components , and by refitting the rest of the line .",
    "based on the results of the coverage fraction analysis , we separate all nals into three classes based on the reliability of the conclusion that they are intrinsic : classes a and b respectively contain `` reliable '' and `` possible '' partially covered nals ( i.e. , intrinsic nal candidates ) , and class c consists of nals with no evidence for partial coverage ( i.e. , intervening or unclassified nals ) .",
    "we may regard classes a  c as including progressively smaller fractions of intrinsic nals and we will treat them as such in our subsequent statistical analysis .",
    "we classified four mini - bals as class a systems .",
    "we also classified three nals into class b , although they did not exhibit partial coverage , because they show line - locking , which is often seen in intrinsic nals at @xmath88 . in the list below and in the flow chart of figure  [ fig : flow ] ,",
    "we give the criteria and method that we used to classify nals into reliability classes .",

    "class c : : :    lines without partial coverage and unclassifiable lines :    +    c1 : ; ;      minfit gives      @xmath90      for all components .",
    "c2 : ; ;      no components can be used for classification because they suffer      from systematic errors as described in the next paragraph .",
    "c3 : ; ;      the system is not acceptable for classification because of problems      due to model fit , continuum fit , or critical data defect .    during line classification ,",
    "we ignore components that satisfy the following criteria .",
    "these were established by following the same procedure to fit strong doublets identified in the same spectra .",
    "for the strong lines we would expect full coverage for all components , but we find  to be inconsistent with unity if these criteria apply :    1 .   weak components at the edge of a system .",
    "2 .   weak components between much stronger components . 3 .   components in a heavily blended region ( except for regions with extremely high s / n ) .",
    "components for which we obtained unphysical values of  in the first fitting trial .",
    "as we noted above , we set @xmath87 for such components and repeat the fit for the other components in the system .",
    "if at least one component of a nal satisfies one of the criteria for class a or b , we would classify the nal as an intrinsic nal candidate , even if the other components are consistent with full coverage .",
    "this applies even for a poisson system for which only one component in one of the separate lines satisfies the class a or b criteria .",
    "also , if a poisson system has more than one doublet transition detected and one or more of the transitions ( , , or ) belongs in class a , it is considered a class a intrinsic system .",
    "similarly , such a system will be considered a class b system if one or more transitions fall in class b ( and none is class a ) .    placing a poisson system in class a or b if only one component satisfies the classification criteria involves the following caveat : the class a or b nal may be superposed on an intervening system by chance .",
    "we have thus evaluated the probability of this chance superposition , using the information in table  [ tab : stats ] .",
    "for example , we have searched for _ associated _ nals in a velocity range @xmath91 and found 3 class a+b and 6 class c nals .",
    "since each nal typically spans a velocity window of 200  or less , the class c nals cover 2.4% of this velocity window .",
    "therefore , the probability that any one of the 3 class a+b nals would be blended with a class c nal ( i.e. , the expected number of blends ) is 0.07 .",
    "similarly , we estimate the number of blends to be 0.25 in the _ non - associated _ velocity range , 0.03 in the velocity range ( associated only ) , and 0.07 in the velocity range ( non - associated only ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the danger of a blend is negligible .    in our final sample of 150 poisson nal systems ,",

    "[ tab : census ] , we give a census of the resulting poisson systems , nals and kinematic components .",
    "using the complete nal sample constructed in the previous section , we first investigate the density of nals per unit redshift interval and per unit velocity interval ( i.e. , the velocity offset distribution , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively ) .",
    "next , we examine the relative numbers of _ intrinsic _ nals in different transitions .",
    "this is of interest because these relative numbers could be indicative of the ionization structure of the absorbers and also of their locations relative to the continuum source .",
    "our analysis provides only lower limits on the intrinsic nal fractions , because intrinsic absorber need not always to show partial coverage , and because some of our sample quasar spectra cover only very small redshift windows for nal detection .",
    "we also examine the distributions of coverage fractions and line profile widths , and consider the ionization conditions of the intrinsic nals in our sample .",
    "finally , we briefly compare the properties of quasars and the properties of intrinsic nals .      in evaluating @xmath92 , we exclude segments of spectra in echelle order gaps , which affect about 8.8% , 16.0% , and 23.0%  of the spectral regions at @xmath315,500   , @xmath316,000   , and @xmath316,500   , respectively .",

    "it is noteworthy that intrinsic nal candidates ( i.e. , class a and b ) are found not only among aals but also among non - aal systems .    in previous studies using low resolution spectra ,",
    "the velocity offset distributions of nals are found to be almost uniform up to @xmath95 ( the maximum velocity at which the doublet can be detected without blending with the ly@xmath9  forest ) .",
    "however , a significant excess of aals was found within 5,000  of radio - loud and steep - spectrum quasars ( young , sargent , & boksenberg 1982 ; richards et al . 1999 , 2001 ;",
    "weymann et al .",
    "( 1979 ) presented evidence that the distribution of intrinsic nals extends up to @xmath96  .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found an excess of nals with @xmath97 in optically luminous quasars , in radio - quiet over radio - loud quasars , and in flat - radio spectrum quasars over steep - radio spectrum quasars .",
    "our results show no remarkable excess of nals in radio - loud quasars , nor any strong excess of nals near the quasars in either the radio - loud or quiet subsamples .",
    "this is not surprising , however , since our subsamples of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars are relatively small and heterogeneous .",
    "considering all nals ( from classes a , b , and c ) together , we do find ( see table  [ tab : stats ] ) that , for nals the values of @xmath92 and @xmath94 in associated regions are about twice as large as those in non - associated regions , in general agreement with the results of weymann et al ( 1979 ) . in figure  [",
    "fig : weym ] , we show the velocity offset distribution of all nals from our survey compared to that of class a@xmath30b nals .    the distribution of rest - frame equivalent widths of the poisson systems detected in our survey is shown in figure  [ fig : ewdist ] .",
    "this distribution rises sharply towards our detection limit of 0.056   .",
    "we note that the vast majority of our nals are considerably weaker than those included in previous surveys at low spectral resolution .",
    "for example , the survey of weymann et al .",
    "( 1979 ) has a rest frame equivalent width limit of about 0.6  (higher than 87% of the nals in our sample ) while the surveys of young et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and f86 have a detection limit of 0.3    ( higher than 70% of the nals in our sample ) .",
    "the more recent vestergaard ( 2003 ) study was also conducted using low spectral resolution , so it focused on absorption lines stronger than @xmath310.3   .",
    "a comparison of the equivalent width distributions between our study and these previous low resolution studies is a useful indication of possible biases due to quasar properties .",
    "however , such a comparison must focus only on our stronger systems .",
    "also , we must group together different lines that fall within 200  of each other in order to compare with systems found at low resolution ( as we did in figure  [ fig : ewdist ] ) .",
    "first we focus on systems with @xmath98 ( ) @xmath99 1.5    since we are concerned about possible biases due to rejecting bal quasars from our sample , and since vestergaard ( 2003 ) targeted the strongest systems as likely intrinsic candidates .",
    "if we take into account vestergaard s different method of measuring the equivalent width of , we find that her sample includes 6/114 quasars that have systems with @xmath98 ( ) @xmath99 1.5   .",
    "however , the vestergaard ( 2003 ) sample has approximately equal numbers of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars , unlike ours , in which only 1/3 of the quasars are radio - loud .",
    "if we consider only her radio - quiet sample , only 1/48 quasars has a nal with @xmath98 ( ) @xmath99 1.5   . in her radio - loud sample ,",
    "5/66 quasars have very strong nals .",
    "thus we would predict that in our sample of @xmath100 quasars ( with only @xmath101 radio - loud ) we would find @xmath102 very strong nals . though we did not find any , our number is certainly consistent with this estimate , and we do find a system with @xmath98 ( ) @xmath311.0   , just below that limit .",
    "we note that due to the nature of vestergaard s study , her sample has a larger than representative fraction of radio - loud quasars .",
    "our sample also has a somewhat larger fraction of radio - loud quasars ( 37% ) compared to the general population ( @xmath3110% ) , which would lead to a bias towards detecting very strong nals compared to the general population .",
    "we next consider somewhat weaker nals , down to @xmath98 ( ) = 0.3   , to facilitate another comparison with the work of vestergaard ( 2003 ) .",
    "she found that 27% of the quasars in her sample had absorption for which the sum of the equivalent widths of the two members of the doublet were @xmath103   . in our sample , we only have 13 quasars for which the most of the associated region is covered .",
    "of those 13 quasars , 9 have @xmath98 ( ) @xmath99 0.056    nals , but only 1(8% ) has @xmath98 ( ) @xmath99 0.3   .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than we would predict ( 3.5/13 = 27% ) based on vestergaard s results , however we again note the differences in the radio properties between the samples .",
    "furthermore , we do not have full coverage of the associated region in all of the 13 quasars , and only 3 of the 13 are radio - loud .",
    "it is also worth noting that typically the vestergaard ( 2003 ) quasars are 1 - 2 magnitudes less luminous than the quasars in our sample .",
    "historically , it has been very difficult to separate intrinsic nals from intervening nals without high resolution spectra because of the similarities of their line profiles . however , if intrinsic nals arise from absorbers similar to those producing bal and mini - bal systems ( widths2,000  ) , they could have larger widths compared to those of intervening nals .",
    "if a tendency for large widths is found among intrinsic nals , this may be used as an additional indicator of their nature . in figure",

    "there are , however , a number of noteworthy caveats to this apparent evolutionary trend , namely ( a ) the samples used at different redshifts have different optical and radio luminosity distributions ( the g01 sample includes a significant fraction of low - luminosity objects , for example ) , ( b ) strong aals appear to prefer steep - spectrum radio - loud quasars ( f86 ; anderson et al . 1987 ) which make up different fractions of the above samples ( the f86 sample is predominantly radio - loud ) , and ( c ) strong aals need not always be intrinsic , in particular they could come from galaxies in a cluster surrounding the quasar , which are more often found around radio - loud quasars ( e.g. , yee & green 1987 , ellison , yee , & green 1991 ; yee & ellison 1993 ; wold et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to the evolution of the fraction of quasars with _ intrinsic _ aals , including weak ones , down to a rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath132  m  ( using samples constructed on the basis of partial coverage or variability ) . at @xmath133 ,",
    "wise et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that a minimum of 27% of quasars have intrinsic aals , while at @xmath134 , narayanan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that a minimum of 25% of quasars host intrinsic aals .",
    "similarly , g99 find that at least 50% of @xmath134 quasars have intrinsic aals , and in this study , we find that a minimum of 23% of quasars at @xmath04 have intrinsic aals .",
    "these fractions are consistent with each other , especially considering that some of the samples are rather small ( only six quasars in the g99 sample ) .",
    "an important caveat here is that all of these results refer to lower limits since nals that do not show variability or partial coverage can still be intrinsic .",
    "this caveat not withstanding , the fraction of quasars hosting _ intrinsic _ aals does not show significant redshift evolution .",
    "a closely related question is the redshift evolution of the fraction of aals that are intrinsic . at @xmath135",
    "this fraction is @xmath136% ( wise et al .",
    "2004 ) , at @xmath131 it is @xmath137% ( narayanan et al .",
    "2004 ) or @xmath138% ( g99 ) , and at @xmath04 it is @xmath139% ( this work ) .",
    "thus , this quantity does not appear to evolve with redshift either , but this conclusion is also subject to the caveat noted above .        in non - associated regions ( i.e. , @xmath140 ) , we found that 1017%  of nals are intrinsic to the quasars .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and richards ( 2001 ) suggested that this fraction is as large as 36% , based on the excess of absorbers at @xmath141 in steep spectrum as compared to flat spectrum radio - loud quasars .",
    "our estimate is strictly only a lower limit , because not all intrinsic nals can be identified using partial coverage .",
    "if we take both our result that 1017% of nals are intrinsic and the richards et al . number of 36% at face value and try to reconcile them , we conclude that only 3050%  of intrinsic nals exhibit detectable partial coverage in our sample .",
    "we caution that the two samples were selected in different ways , leading to biases .",
    "for example , the sample of richards et al .",
    "( 1999 ) has a larger fraction ( @xmath132% ) of radio - loud quasars than our sample ( @xmath142% ) .",
    "however , since they found that intrinsic nals prefer radio - quiet quasars , the difference between our estimate of the fraction of quasars hosting intrinsic nals and theirs would be larger than what it appears , leading to a larger number of fully covered intrinsic nals .",
    "this conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the distribution of measured coverage fractions of intrinsic nals spans the range from 0 to nearly 1 ( within uncertainties ) .",
    "the covering factors are presumably related to the physical sizes of the absorbing structures , which could span a significant range . in this sense",
    "there is nothing special about the size corresponding to a covering factor of 1 .",
    "if there is a cutoff in size , there is no reason it would occur particularly at this value .",
    "thus we strongly expect that many intrinsic absorbers with unit coverage fraction exist",
    ".      the wide range of absorber ionization conditions presented in  [ sec : ionization ] ( e.g. , `` strong '' vs `` strong '' absorbers ) may be a result of a wide distribution of distances of the gas parcels from the continuum source and/or a wide distribution of their densities .",
    "the velocity offset of a system can serve as an indicator of its proximity to the continuum source under the assumption that parcels of gas in an outflowing wind are accelerated outwards from the continuum source .",
    "detailed photoionization modeling of selected systems can help us determine whether there is a relation between their ionization state of nal systems and their apparent outflow velocity , which will allow us to determine whether there is ionization stratification in the outflow .",
    "the same models may also provide constraints on the density of the gas .",
    "in fact , photoionization models for the associated absorber in qso j2233@xmath29606 ( gabel , arav & kim 2006 ) show that the higher - ionization kinematic components are at lower blueshifted velocities than lower - ionization components . moreover , preliminary results of photoionization models for three of the quasars in our sample ( wu et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) suggest that absorbers at different velocities in the same quasar can have a wide range of densities . an alternative way of constraining the density is through monitoring observations , which can set limits on the recombination time scale of the absorber , hence constrain the density ( see , for example , the discussion in wise et al .",
    "2004 , narayanan et al .",
    "2004 , and m05 ) .",
    "it is also important to ask whether the low ionization transitions in intrinsic nals are aligned with the high ionization transitions .",
    "an inspection of the velocity plots of individual systems in the appendix shows that the line centers and profiles of low - ionization lines in intrinsic nal systems are almost always similar to those of high - ionization lines .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the low - ionization lines arise in the intrinsic absorbers and not in the ism of the host galaxy .",
    "our finding ( supported by the independent method of richards 2001 ) that a significant fraction of nals , even at high velocity offsets from the quasar redshift , are intrinsic ( 1017%  of nals and 1520% of nals ) has implications for cosmology since it affects the estimates of the density of intervening systems per unit redshift ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "for example , at @xmath04 , @xmath92 is estimated to be 3.11 for and 1.36 for systems with a rest frame equivalent width greater than 0.15  ( misawa et al .",
    "if these values are reduced by 1530% after correction for intrinsic systems , this would require some adjustment of models for cosmological evolution of these systems .",
    "furthermore , the contamination of the ly@xmath9  forest by very high metallicity intrinsic nals could seriously bias estimations of the metallicity of the forest .",
    "the results of our survey have direct implications for models of quasar outflows , whatever the acceleration mechanism .    1 .",
    "the minimum fraction of quasars with at least one intrinsic nal ( , , or ) is 4354% .",
    "if there is an additional family of intrinsic absorbers , without corresponding or lines , the minimum fraction of quasars with intrinsic nals will increase further .",
    "this leads to a constraint on the solid angle subtended by the nal absorbers to the background source(s ) .",
    "we can interpret this result in the context of a simple ( but clearly not unique ) picture in which all quasars in our sample are similar to each other and the nal gas is located at intermediate latitudes above the streamlines of a fast , equatorial outflow ( a bal wind ) .",
    "this geometry is similar to that depicted in figure  13 of g01 , although it needs not apply specifically to an outflow launched from the accretion disk ; a pressure - driven outflow launched from a distance of an order of 1  pc from the black hole may have a similar geometry . in this picture",
    ", the above observational constraint translates directly into the opening angle of the nal zone , given the opening angle of the bal wind . for an opening angle of the bal wind of",
    "approximately 712@xmath143 ( 1020% of quasars are bal quasars ; e.g. , hamann , korista , & morris 1993 ) the angular width of the nal zone turns out to be 2527@xmath143 . in this picture the polar region , at latitudes above the nal zone may be filled with highly - ionized gas .",
    "this idea is consistent with the finding of barthel , tytler & vestergaard ( 1997 ) that strong associated nals with @xmath144 @xmath99 3   are most common at angles far from the jet axis in radio - loud qsos ( as high as @xmath145 ) .",
    "such strong nals may represent intermediate viewing angles between intrinsic nals and bals .",
    "other simple interpretations are also possible : for example , the nal gas may be distributed isotropically around the central engine , or some quasars may be more likely than others to host such absorbers ( e.g. , the width of the nal zone may depend on luminosity , as suggested by elvis 2000 ) .",
    "the density of intrinsic ( class a@xmath30b ) nals per unit velocity interval , @xmath94 , increases from 4.1 at @xmath146 to 18 at @xmath147 .",
    "this is a significant increase with a chance probability of only 5% .",
    "these results have a number of implications for outflow models .",
    "first , the high - velocity nals ( 71% of class a+b nals at @xmath146 ) are unlikely to be associated with pressure - driven outflows because these outflows can only reach velocities of order @xmath2",
    ". the distribution of @xmath94 with @xmath148 does not provide a straightforward constraint on the acceleration mechanism because the models do not predict how individual parcels of nal gas are distributed .",
    "one could take the higher value of @xmath94 at low velocities as an indication of the existence of a separate population of absorbers , which could perhaps be identified with a pressure driven wind .",
    "on the other hand , the velocity of a magnetocentrifugal or line - driven accretion disk wind increases smoothly with radius , which may lead to higher density of nals per unit velocity at low velocities ( assuming that the gas parcels are condensations that form near the base of the wind and are accelerated outwards ) .",
    "economy of means and occam s razor favor the latter explanation since it applies to both high- and low - velocity nals and invokes a single acceleration mechanism .",
    "this issue can be addressed observationally by constraining the distance of the low - velocity ( _ associated _ ) nal gas from the central engine .",
    "this can be done by combining constraints on its ionization parameter ( obtained from photionization models ) with constraints on its density ( obtained from variability studies ) .",
    "3 .   the column densities derived from fitting the line profiles , can yield a preliminary estimate of the total hydrogen column densities ( + ) in the absorbers . more specifically",
    ", we can apply the calculations of hamann ( 1997 ) to estimate an upper limit to the hydrogen column density of absorbers in our sample from our highest measured column density of @xmath149 ( in the @xmath150 nal in he0130@xmath294021 ) . if we assume an abundance of relative to c of @xmath151 \\approx -0.34 $ ] ( this limit corresponds to the optimal ionization parameter that maximizes the abundance ; see figure 2 of hamann 1997 ) and a solar abundance of c relative to h , @xmath152 ( grevese & anders 1989 ) , we obtain @xmath153  @xmath13 .",
    "if the c abundance is super - solar ( e.g. , hamann 1997 ) , this limit will become smaller , of course .",
    "higher total column densities have also been observed in nals ; for example , arav et al . ( 2001a ) find @xmath154 in qso  j2359@xmath291241 .",
    "moreover , total column densities in bals can be an order of magnitude higher ( e.g. , in pg  0946@xmath30301 ; arav et al .",
    "+ we emphasize that the column densities estimated above refer only to the gas responsible for the nals .",
    "this gas could well have the form of filaments embedded in a hotter medium , as predicted by many models ( see  [ sec : intro ] and references therein ) .",
    "if that is the case , then the total column density of the outflow can be considerably larger than what we have estimated above .",
    "in fact , x - ray spectroscopy of nearby agns does indicate a multi - phase absorber structure in which the column density of the hot medium is higher than that of the cold medium by a factor of 30 or more .",
    "( e.g. , netzer et al .",
    "2003 , kaspi et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein )    for the specific case of radiatively - accelerated outflows , we can ask whether the observed high velocities of some nals are attainable in the context of the model .",
    "hamann ( 1998 ) derives the following expression for the terminal velocity of a radiatively accelerated wind @xmath155 where @xmath156  pc is the distance of the absorber from the continuum source , @xmath157 is the quasar luminosity , @xmath158 is the black hole mass , and @xmath159 is the fraction of continuum photons absorbed or scattered by the gas , and @xmath160 is the column density of the absorbing gas . noting that @xmath161 ( where @xmath162 is the eddington luminosity ) and that @xmath163 ( @xmath164 and @xmath165 is the gravitational radius ) , we may recast equation  ( [ eqn : fred ] ) as @xmath166 as hamann ( 1998 ) argues , @xmath167 for bal quasars .",
    "the radiation - pressure dominated part of the accretion disk extends up to @xmath168 for parameters scaled as above ( see shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . according to most models for accretion disk winds ( murray et al 1995 ; proga et al .",
    "2000 ; everett 2005 ) , the inner launch radius of the wind corresponds to @xmath1690.25 .",
    "moreover , the column densities that we find observationally ( see discussion above ) indicate total hydrogen column densities in nals corresponding to @xmath170 . under these conditions , radiation pressure can accelerate the nal gas to terminal speeds well in excess of @xmath171 , and the observed blueshifts of intrinsic nals can be easily explained .",
    "there is an important caveat to the above estimate .",
    "we have assumed that the column density that we have measured from the nal profiles traces all of the matter that is being accelerated .",
    "but , as we note earlier in this section , the nal gas may be embedded in a hot medium and it may represent only a small fraction of the total gas mass .",
    "in such a case , the attainable terminal velocity will decrease accordingly . more specifically ,",
    "if the nal gas represents up to 10% of the total column density , then equation  ( [ eqn : vinf ] ) can still reproduce the observed nal velocities .",
    "but if the total column density is more than an order of magnitude higher than the nal column density , then a different acceleration mechanism must be sought .",
    "we have constructed a large , relatively unbiased , equivalent width limited sample of _ intrinsic _ narrow absorption line ( nal ) systems found in the spectra of @xmath04 quasars .",
    "this sample comprises 124 , 12 , and 50 doublets , which were separated from intervening nals on the basis of their partial coverage signature . after assessing the reliability of the determination of the intrinsic nature of these nal systems ,",
    "28 are deemed reliably intrinsic ( `` class a '' ) , 11 are deemed possibly intrinsic ( `` class b '' ) and 111 are deemed intervening ( or unreliable intrinsic candidates ; `` class c '' ) . using this sample of nal systems ,",
    "we study their demographics , the distribution of their physical properties , and any relations between them .",
    "we also consider the implications of these results for models of outflowing winds .",
    "our findings and conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "the fraction of intrinsic systems in our sample nals is 1119% .",
    "this value increases to 33%  if only associated systems , within 5,000  of the quasar emission redshift , are considered .",
    "this is roughly consistent with previous studies of associated nals at different redshifts and employing different methods .",
    "it is important to note , however , that all of the above fractions are , in fact lower limits to the true fractions .",
    "the fraction of intrinsic systems is 1418% , although all of these are found in the non - associated regions of the spectra , at offset velocities @xmath172 relative to the quasar redshifts .",
    "severe contamination by the ly@xmath9  forest allowed us to search only for associated systems .",
    "we found 75%  of such systems to be reliably intrinsic .",
    "the minimum fraction of quasars that have one or more intrinsic nals is 4354% .",
    "while intrinsic nals were detected in 2432%  of the quasars with adequate velocity coverage , intrinsic nals were detected in 19%  of the quasars , and intrinsic nals in 1924%  of the quasars .",
    "these are lower limits because our spectra do not have full offset velocity coverage for these transitions and because some intrinsic absorbers may not exhibit the signature of partial coverage .",
    "this places a constraint on the solid angle subtended by the absorber to the background source(s ) .",
    "we find that 1017% of _ non - associated _",
    "nal systems are intrinsic . in cosmological applications ,",
    "non - associated systems are typically taken to be intervening .",
    "thus , our result is important because it shows that it is necessary to correct derived cosmological quantities for a contamination by intrinsic nals .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by richards et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and richards ( 2001 ) based on a statistical study of nals in different quasar samples , although they estimated a somewhat higher contamination of @xmath3136% . taking the two estimates at face value ( i.e. , neglecting the possibility that they differ because of systematic effects and demanding that they should be reconciled ) we are led to the conclusion that only 3050%of intrinsic nals exhibit partial coverage .",
    "the coverage fractions of intrinsic nals in our sample , span almost the entire range from 0 to 1 .",
    "since there is a range of sizes for intrinsic gas parcels , this also implies that there are a significant number of intrinsic absorbers that have full coverage , and thus were not detected in our survey .",
    "there is no apparent relationship between coverage fraction and velocity offset . nor is there any relation between the nal properties or frequency of incidence and the properties of the host quasars ( such as optical or radio luminosity ) .",
    "we consider the ionization structure of the 39 class a and b intrinsic nal systems in our sample , and find two major categories , which may represent absorbers of different densities and/or at different distances from the source of the ionizing continuum .",
    "+ \\(a ) `` strong '' systems are characterized by strong , partially covered doublets , strong , usually `` black '' , ly@xmath9  lines , and relatively weak or undetectable doublets .",
    "of the 28 systems in this category , 25 also have intermediate ionization lines detected ( such as , , and/or ) and 15 systems also have low ionization absorption detected ( e.g. , , , ) . in cases where the ly@xmath9  profile is black",
    ", it is clear that it does not arise in the same gas parcel as the absorption , since the coverage fraction for ly@xmath9  is clearly 1 .",
    "these systems can not be distinguished from typical intervening systems except by partial coverage .",
    "+ \\(b ) `` strong '' systems are characterized by strong lines , and relatively weak , non - black ly@xmath9  lines ( with less than twice the equivalent width of their lines ) . and lines",
    "may also be detected in these systems , and in some cases may be stronger than .",
    "we find 11 systems in this way , 5 of which have intermediate ionization transitions detected , and only 1 of which has low ionization transitions detected .",
    "about 53%  of class a or b nal systems include low ionization lines .",
    "this fraction is much higher than that of lobal quasars among all bal quasars ( 1317% ) . in the 15 systems with detected low ionization lines , the line profiles of the and low ionization lines are similar .",
    "in particular , low ionization lines are rarely detected at velocities other than those of the partially covered components , implying that both families of lines arise in the same parcels of gas .",
    "our detection of a significant population of intrinsic , high - velocity nals ( @xmath173 ) disfavors scenarios in which the absorbing gas is associated with a pressure driven wind that does not originate very deep in the potential well of the black hole . the low - velocity nals that we have detected could still originate in pressure driven winds .",
    "however , economy of means leads us to prefer accretion disk winds because these can explain both the high- and the low - velocity nals .",
    "repeated observations of the nals in this sample at the same spectral resolution and s / n would be particularly valuable for the following reasons .",
    "first , they will allow us to search for nal variability , which can be used to confirm intrinsic nals and to probe the relation between variability and partial coverage of intrinsic nals .",
    "second , variability sampled via multi - epoch observations carries additional information that may allow us to constrain properties of the absorber ( e.g. , density and distance from the continuum source ; see applications by hamann et al . 1997a ; narayanan et al .",
    "2004 ; m05 ) .",
    "multi - epoch observations of such a large sample of nals have never been carried out , in spite of their utility in providing crucial constraints on quasar outflows .",

    "<S> we use keck / hires spectra of 37 optically bright quasars at @xmath04 to study narrow absorption lines that are intrinsic to the quasars ( intrinsic nals , produced in gas that is physically associated with the quasar central engine ) . </S>",
    "<S> we identify 150 nal systems , that contain 124 , 12 , and 50 doublets , of which 18 are associated systems ( within 5,000  of the quasar redshift ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use partial coverage analysis to separate intrinsic nals from nals produced in cosmologically intervening structures . </S>",
    "<S> we find 39 candidate intrinsic systems , ( 28 reliable determinations and 11 that are possibly intrinsic ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that 1017% of systems at blueshifts of 5,00070,000  relative to quasars are intrinsic . </S>",
    "<S> at least 32% of quasars contain one or more intrinsic nals . </S>",
    "<S> considering and doublets showing partial coverage as well , at least 50% of quasars host intrinsic nals . </S>",
    "<S> this result constrains the solid angle subtended by the absorbers to the background source(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> we identify two families of intrinsic nal systems , those with strong absorption , and those with negligible absorption in , but with partial coverage in the doublet . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the idea that these two families represent different regions or conditions in accretion disk winds . of the 26 intrinsic nal systems </S>",
    "<S> , 13 have detectable low - ionization absorption lines at similar velocities , suggesting that these are two - phase structures in the wind rather than absorbers in the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare possible models for quasar outflows , including radiatively accelerated disk - driven winds , magnetocentrifugally accelerated winds , and pressure - driven winds , and we discuss ways of distinguishing between these models observationally . </S>"
