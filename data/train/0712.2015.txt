    "the populations of small solar system bodies ( sssb ) in the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter , jovian and neptunian trojans , and in the kuiper belt beyond neptune s orbit ( often called also trans - neptunian objects  tnos ) remain the least explored members of the solar system .",
    "a majority of the mbas and kbos have their orbits distributed near the ecliptic with a fwhm of the order of 10@xmath5 in ecliptic latitude @xcite .",
    "the spatial and size distributions of these objects provides important information about the dynamical evolution of the solar system . extending our knowledge of the size distribution of these objects below current sub - kilometer size limits of optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and infrared ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) measurements would provide additional information on the accretion / collision and depletion processes that formed the populations of sssbs . in this paper",
    "we show that the cr - induced @xmath0-ray albedo of these systems may be bright enough to be detected with a @xmath0-ray telescope such as glast and/or integral and/or soft gamma - ray detector ( sgd ) aboard the next satellite @xcite ( see our estimates below ) , and can allow us to probe the size distribution of sssbs down to a few metres .",
    "additionally , the @xmath0-ray emission of these systems may comprise a `` diffuse '' @xmath0-ray foreground that should be taken into account when evaluating the flux and spectra of @xmath0-ray sources near the ecliptic .",
    "our preliminary results are presented in @xcite .",
    "the galactic center is a region crowded with @xmath0-ray sources and is one of the preferred places to look for @xmath0-ray signatures of dark matter ( dm ) . an extensive literature on the subject exists , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; also references in these papers .",
    "the ecliptic crosses the galactic equator near the galactic center almost perpendicularly with inclination @xmath1@xmath6 , and underestimation of the sssb albedo foreground may lead to errors in the analysis of weak or extended sources in this region .",
    "the galactic center region also harbors the enigmatic source of the 511 kev positron annihilation line observed by the _ oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment _ ( osse ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and integral ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of the annihilation line does not match the distribution of any positron source candidate , e.g. , pulsars , supernova remnants , binaries , radioactive isotopes , such as @xmath7al , etc .",
    "a number of excellent discussions on the origin of this emission are available in the literature , ranging from positron focusing by the regular galactic magnetic field to dm annihilation .",
    "our calculations ( detailed below ) indicate the sssb cr - induced albedo spectrum should exhibit a 511 kev line due to secondary positrons annihilating in the rock .",
    "since the target material ( rock , ice ) is solid , the line has to be very narrow .",
    "this emission produces a previously unrecognized celestial foreground to the 511 kev flux including the direction of the galactic center .    at higher energies , above @xmath130 mev ,",
    "regions at high galactic latitudes are conventionally used to derive the level of the extragalactic @xmath0-ray emission by comparing a model of the diffuse galactic emission to the point - source - subtracted skymaps and extrapolating to zero model flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the remainder is assumed to represent the level of the isotropic , presumably extragalactic emission .",
    "however , recent studies have predicted another important foreground component with a broad distribution on the sky originating from the inverse compton scattering of solar photons by cr electrons in the heliosphere @xcite , which has to be included in the analysis of the diffuse emission .",
    "a reanalysis of the egret data revealed this broad component , in agreement with the predictions @xcite . since the ecliptic passes through high galactic latitudes ,",
    "the sssb albedo flux also may need to be taken into account when analysing the weak extragalactic component .",
    "the asteroid mass and size distributions are thought to be governed by collisional evolution and accretion .",
    "collisions between asteroids give rise to a cascade of fragments , shifting mass toward smaller sizes , while slow accretion leads to the growth of the latter .",
    "the first comprehensive analytical description of such a collisional cascade is given by @xcite .",
    "under the assumptions of scaling of the collisional response parameters and an upper cutoff in mass , the relaxed size and mass distributions approach power - laws : @xmath8where @xmath9 is the asteroid mass , @xmath10 is the asteroid radius , and @xmath11 are constants .",

    "smaller sizes are very difficult to detect , and one has bear in mind the observational bias of the incompleteness of the small ( dim ) asteroid sample . though de - biasing can be attempted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we will use this distribution in our estimates of the mba albedo , below .",
    "the dynamical estimate of the total mass of the asteroid belt is about @xmath35 g @xcite or close to 5% of the mass of the moon .",
    "the total mass is dominated by large bodies , while the @xmath0-ray albedo is dominated by very small bodies .",
    "the largest mba , 1 ceres , comprises about 30% of the total mass of the asteroid belt alone .",
    "however , it does not provide a restriction on the size ( and mass ) distribution of small bodies .",
    "current estimates indicate the total number of mbas above 1 km in diameter is @xmath36 @xcite .",

    "the densities of most mbas lie in the range 1.0  3.5 g @xmath42 @xcite while the densities of particular asteroid classes can vary broadly , 1.23  1.40 g @xmath42 for carbonaceous , 2.65  2.75 g @xmath42 for silicate , and 4.75  5.82 g @xmath42 for metallic bodies @xcite .",

    "the jovian trojan populations of asteroids are collections of bodies in the same orbit as jupiter ( semimajor axis @xmath45 au ) located at the @xmath46 and @xmath47 lagrange points of the jupiter - sun system .",
    "the trojans are thus concentrated in two regions rather than distributed over the entire ecliptic as for the mbas .",
    "the total mass of the jovian trojans is estimated to be @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath49 is the mass of the earth with a differential power - law index @xmath50 in the size range 2 km to 20 km @xcite , similar to mbas , giving a number of objects @xmath51 1 km in diameter @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the combined mass of these objects is approximately the same as for the mbas . the number of objects @xmath51 1 km in diameter and the power - law index @xmath50 makes their size distribution very similar to that of mbas .",
    "the mass density of sssbs in this group varies significantly : estimates for the binary trojan 617 patroclus are less than water ice @xmath53 g @xmath42 @xcite , as are those for other trojan binaries @xmath54 g @xmath42 @xcite , while 624 hektor is somewhat denser @xmath55 g @xmath42 @xcite . in our calculations",

    "the kbos are not uniformly distributed , with at least three dynamically distinct populations identified : the classical disk , the scattered disk with large eccentricities and inclinations , and `` plutinos '' around the 3:2 mean motion resonance with neptune at 39.4 au .",

    "the kbo size distribution is much more difficult to determine because of their dimness .",
    "it is widely believed that the tnos are dynamically related to the centaurs ( planetesimals distributed between jupiter and neptune that are in crossing orbits of the giant gas planets ) , and to the jupiter - family group of ecliptic comets that may be objects that were knocked inwards from the kuiper belt .",
    "the kbo size distribution is determined by very indirect methods such as measuring the sizes of the nuclei of the ecliptic comets ( and making assumptions on how they evolve during their repeated passages through the inner solar system ) , and centaurs , as well as impact craters on the galilean satellites of jupiter .",

    "while centaurs are scattered between jupiter and neptune , the positions of neptunian trojans are well known so that the detection of a @xmath0-ray albedo signal may be simplified .",
    "we use the lunar albedo spectrum as an approximation of the sssb albedo for two main reasons : ( i ) the moon is a solid body in which the cr cascade in the rock develops similarly , and ( ii ) its proximity to the earth allows it to be easily detectable by @xmath0-ray telescopes .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0-rays from the moon has been calculated recently @xcite using the geant4  monte carlo framework to simulate the cr cascade development in a lunar rock target ( regolith ) .",
    "it has been shown that the lunar albedo spectrum is very steep with an effective cutoff around 34 gev in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "the central part of the disk of the moon has an even steeper spectrum with an effective cutoff at @xmath1600 mev .",
    "the emission above @xmath110 mev is thus dominated by the thin rim where cr particles interact close - to tangentially with the surface and the high - energy secondary @xmath0-rays shower out of the moon toward the observer .",
    "in contrast to other astrophysical sources , the albedo spectrum of the moon is well understood , including its absolute normalization ; this makes it a useful template for estimations of the cr - induced albedo of sssbs without an atmosphere . since the moon functions as a standard ( @xmath0-ray ) candle , in our estimates we use the flux of the moon as our standard and",

    "challenges to detecting diffuse emission associated with the ecliptic plane include the brightness of the galactic diffuse emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the presence of bright point sources , the limited angular resolution and photon statistics of the egret data , and potential large - scale artifacts in the exposure maps owing to ageing of the spark chamber gas .",

    "the event data , after standard cuts on zenith angle and inclination angle ( 30@xmath5 ) , were binned on a photon - by - photon basis in ecliptic coordinates .",

    "the fits included a constant term to account for galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission ; profiles of the fits are included in figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "the effective psf for egret in the 100500 mev range for the expected spectrum of the albedo emission is approximately 4@xmath5 fwhm , which would not appreciably broaden the apparent distribution of @xmath0-ray intensity . in any case",
    ", the assumption of a single gaussian profile is an approximation ; the contribution from mbas should result in an additional somewhat narrower but fainter component to the diffuse emission around the ecliptic .",
    "gamma - ray emission associated with the moon and sun also contributes to the intensity of the sky at low ecliptic latitudes .",
    "the moon is always within about 5@xmath5 of the ecliptic and the profiles shown in figure 5 undoubtedly include lunar albedo @xmath0-ray emission , at a level of @xmath190 @xmath3 s@xmath4 @xcite . as described by @xcite the solar radiation field is a fairly bright and diffuse @xmath0-ray source from inverse compton scattering of cr electrons .",
    "the solar inverse compton emission is brightest in the ecliptic plane but of course depends on solar elongation angle .",
    "the precise contribution to the diffuse intensity at low ecliptic latitudes is difficult to estimate .",
    "the sun was in the field of view of egret for only a small fraction of the observing time and the contribution to the total flux should have been less than that of the moon .    after the bright diffuse emission and identified point sources are masked from the egret data , no strong excess of diffuse emission is apparent at low ecliptic latitudes in figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "the integrated fluxes are formally significant for the case where the galactic plane and all sources identified in the 3eg catalog are masked out ( table  [ table1 ] , figure  [ fig : profiles]@xmath177 ) , but the systematic uncertainties are comparable to the measurement . this is suggested by the effect on the integrated flux from masking out several more sources that @xcite identified as blazars ( figure  [ fig : profiles]@xmath90 ) . the overall average exposure does not change appreciably as a result of the additional masking but the fit flux decreased by more than 50% ( table  [ table1 ] ) .    based on our analysis of the egret data we infer that the diffuse emission from mbas , trojans , and kbos has an integrated flux of less than @xmath1@xmath191 @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 100500 mev ) , as derived from the set of cuts @xmath172 , which corresponds to @xmath112 lunar albedo flux units .",
    "the albedo @xmath0-ray flux from mbas can be calculated using eqs .",
    "( [ eq7])([eq11 ] ) and figures  [ fig : moon1 ] , [ fig : moon ] where we assume that their surface material is regolith .",
    "we use the following parameters : @xmath43 g @xmath42 for the mba average density , @xmath129 cm for the radius of ceres , @xmath192 cm for the smallest radius of an asteroid that is still an opaque target for incident cr particles .",
    "the central grammage in this case ( @xmath192 cm ) is @xmath1400 g @xmath3 .",
    "since the composition of the mbas ( and other sssb populations ) is mainly oxygen , this corresponds to @xmath15 interaction lengths which is sufficient for the hadronic cascade to fully develop at the cr energies we consider . with these parameters ,",
    "the total mba albedo flux is @xmath193 , 0.67 , 12 for extrapolation to small sizes with indices @xmath194 , 3.0 , 3.5 ( see figure  [ fig1a ] ) , correspondingly .",
    "similarly , for the jovian trojan asteroids we can estimate the @xmath0-ray flux assuming the same size distribution as for mbas , but with @xmath45 au , and @xmath195 cm ( which gives the same central grammage for @xmath56 g @xmath42 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath196 , 0.07 , 0.8 ( averaged over their orbit ) for a similar extrapolation to small sizes with indices @xmath197 , 3.0 , 3.5 . for the closest ( 4.2 au ) and the farthest ( 6.2 au ) distances to earth , the fluxes will be 0.01 , 0.1 , 1.2 and 0.006 , 0.05 , 0.5 , correspondingly .",
    "the kbo size distribution is known very approximately .",
    "the second largest object of the kuiper belt after 136199 eris is pluto @xmath130 cm , while the majority of the kbos are icy rocks and comets with @xmath198 g @xmath42 . to keep the same central grammage of the smallest body @xmath1400 g @xmath3 we have to use a larger minimum radius , @xmath199 cm , than for the mbas .",
    "the incident spectrum of cr particles at @xmath13130 au approaches the lis spectrum which results in a factor of @xmath12 increase below @xmath11 gev of the albedo flux compared to the same body at 1 au ( figure  [ fig : moon1 ] ) . for these parameters ,",
    "the total kuiper belt albedo flux is @xmath200 , 34 , 1168 for @xmath18 , 3.5 , 3.9 , correspondingly .",
    "the removal of eris and pluto ( @xmath1@xmath201 combined ) from the kuiper belt and using charon instead , @xmath202 cm , results in the flux increase : @xmath203 , 46 , 1222 for the same values of @xmath204 . however , this change is simply the result of anchoring the power - law size distribution to a large body .",
    "our estimates show that the albedo of mbas and kbos could account for the egret upper limit of the flux from the ecliptic . for the adopted size distributions of sssbs ( @xmath18 for mbas and @xmath16 for kbos ) ,",
    "the kbo albedo is essentially brighter . however , if the mba size distribution is somewhat steeper than our adopted index of @xmath205 , e.g. , as for the distribution proposed by @xcite , it can account for the total albedo flux from the ecliptic .",
    "the sssb @xmath0-ray albedo , especially of the collectively moving trojan groups , might be responsible for some fraction of the egret unidentified point sources at low ecliptic latitudes .    a possible way to distinguish",
    "the albedo emission of mbas and kbos is to study the emission as a function of solar elongation angle . in the antisolar direction , @xmath206 , the direction in which the main belt is closest to the earth ( @xmath11.7 au ) ,",
    "the flux is predicted to be as much as @xmath15 times that in the solar direction , @xmath207 . on the other hand ,",
    "the brightness of the kuiper belt is only weakly dependent on the elongation angle because it is much further away .",
    "the positions of the trojans on the sky are known , being determined relative to their respective planet ( jupiter , neptune ) , making them easier to detect .",
    "the detection of the cr - induced @xmath0-ray albedo of mbas , trojans , and the kbos by @xmath0-ray instruments is possible . at higher energies @xmath2081 gev where the @xmath0-ray albedo flux is steady and does not depend on the solar modulation , it can serve as a normalization point to the cumulative brightness of all mbas plus kbos . at lower energies @xmath2091 gev ,",
    "the component of the albedo which is independent of elongation , the kbo albedo , will tell us directly about the lis spectrum of crs .",
    "therefore , the observations of the albedo flux can provide us with valuable information about the size distributions of sssbs in both regions , while the shape of the albedo spectrum can tell us about the lis spectra of cr protons and helium at high energies . in turn",
    ", a detection of the mba and kbo albedo at mev - gev energies will enable us to normalize properly the cumulative albedo spectrum and make a prediction for the intensity of the 511 kev line .",
    "a conservative estimate of the 511 kev line flux from sssbs can be made using the upper limit derived in section  [ egret ] .",
    "the total flux of 511 kev photons from the moon is @xmath210 photons @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( figure  [ fig : moon1 ] , @xmath155 mv ) , where @xmath211 mev is the size of the bin containing @xmath212 mev .",
    "the total flux from the sssbs @xmath213 can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq7])([eq11 ] ) .",
    "the sssb albedo contribution to the 511 kev line flux within the galactic bulge is @xmath214 , where we assumed that the fwhm of the bulge is @xmath1@xmath215 @xcite , and @xmath216 , and we used the upper limit derived in section  [ egret ] .",
    "it gives @xmath1@xmath217 photons @xmath3 s@xmath4 , which is about 2% of the total bulge emission as observed by the integral @xmath218 photons @xmath3 s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "since most of the integral observing time was spent on observations of the galactic bulge and a comparatively small fraction went into observing regions above and below the galactic plane , it is not surprising that a diffuse band near the ecliptic ( the sssb albedo ) has not been found so far .",
    "it is interesting that the osse map of the 511 kev line has a controversial feature , the so - called `` annihilation fountain , '' above the galactic bulge @xcite which , in fact , may be the asteroid albedo foreground instead .",
    "note , that the @xmath0-ray spectrometer on the near - shoemaker spacecraft made observations of the 511 kev line from 433 eros @xcite on the surface of eros itself , however , it is hard to judge the absolute intensity of the line from the published data .",
    "our estimates of the fluxes assume that the mass and radius distributions are valid for the whole range of masses , which is not necessarily true .",
    "the number of small bodies may be larger or smaller than the extrapolation from the distribution of more massive bodies .",
    "we have also assumed spherical bodies .",
    "however , the smallest bodies are distinctly non - spherical which would make them somewhat brighter than we have estimated .",
    "thus , our calculations underestimate the sssb albedo emission .",
    "the bodies that are smaller than the cutoff radius ( @xmath192 cm for mbas , 200 cm for trojans , 400 cm for kbos ) will also contribute to the albedo flux .",
    "because of their smaller size , only the initial stage of the cr cascade will develop , producing a harder albedo spectrum while its intensity will be reduced due to the partial conversion of energy of the primary cr particles into albedo @xmath0-rays .",
    "we emphasise that the detection of the @xmath0-ray albedo from mbas , kbos , and other sssb families directly probes the size distribution of these bodies below the detection limit of other methods , over considerably larger regions of the sky .",
    "the detectability of the @xmath0-ray emission by these objects has implications for studies of the evolution of the solar and exo - solar planetary systems @xcite , studies of crs , and diffuse @xmath0-rays .",
    "the glast large area telescope ( lat ) , to be launched by nasa in may 2008 , will in just one year have an essentially uniform exposure over the entire sky a factor of 40 or more deeper than egret and will be free from sensitivity variations owing to ageing of consumables",
    ". this capability will permit detection of albedo @xmath0-ray fluxes for sssbs at even the lunar flux level .",
