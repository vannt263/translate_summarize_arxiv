    "the @xmath1ray spectra and yields @xcite@xcite , produced by the atomic transitions @xmath2 in kaonic hydrogen , where @xmath3 is the _ principle quantum number _ of the energy levels , are the main experimental tool for the measurement of the energy level displacement of the ground state of kaonic hydrogen , caused by strong low  energy @xmath4 interactions",
    "it is known @xcite@xcite that the @xmath1ray yields related to the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 lines of kaonic hydrogen are very sensitive to the value of @xmath8 , the rate of hadronic decays of kaonic hydrogen from the @xmath9 state .",
    "usually @xmath8 is used as an input parameter in the theories of the atomic cascades @xcite@xcite .    recently @xcite we have calculated the rate @xmath10 of hadronic decays of kaonic hydrogen from the @xmath11 state . for the @xmath9 state",
    "we have obtained : @xmath12 .",

    "we continue the analysis of the influence of strong low ",

    "we investigate the radiative transitions @xmath14 , induced by strong low  energy interactions and enhanced by the coulomb interaction of the @xmath15 pair , in kaonic hydrogen and extend the results on kaonic deuterium .",
