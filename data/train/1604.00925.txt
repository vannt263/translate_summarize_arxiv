    "thanks to the discovery of neutrino oscillations @xcite , leptonic flavour mixing has been observed by a series of atmospheric @xcite , solar @xcite , accelerator @xcite and reactor @xcite neutrino experiments .",
    "the three mixing angles have been measured to a very good accuracy .",
    "both the atmospheric angle @xmath4 and the solar angle @xmath5 are rather large , and an order 0.1 reactor angle @xmath6 has been measured by reactor neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 ranges of mixing angles from current global analysis of solar , atmospheric , accelerator and reactor neutrino oscillation measurements @xcite are given by @xmath8 there is also a preliminary hint @xcite for a maximally cp - violating value of the dirac phase with a best - fit value @xmath9 by combining the latest t2k @xcite and daya bay @xcite data , but the statistical significance of this result is still low and at @xmath7 all possible values of @xmath10 are allowed .    motivated by these values of the mixing angles , specific mixing patterns , realised at leading order ,",
    "have been proposed in the last two decades . among them , the tri - bimaximal ( tbm ) mixing predicts @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which fit well current oscillation data and has therefore attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "however , exact tbm mixing is ruled out due to the prediction of a vanishing @xmath6 . to be compatible with current data , corrections to tbm must be introduced @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "several possibilities have been discussed in the literature , such as tbm - cabbibo mixing @xcite and trimaximal ( tm ) mixing in two forms , where the first and second columns of the pmns matrix take the same values as tbm , called tm1 @xcite and tm2 @xcite , respectively .",
    "these specific mixing patterns can arise in flavour models in which discrete flavour symmetries are satisfied @xcite .",
    "these models suggest that , at some high energy scale , there exists an underlying discrete flavour symmetry in the flavour space .",
    "new scalars called flavons are introduced and achieve non - trivial vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) at a lower energy scale , leading to the spontaneous breaking of the full symmetry . as proposed in @xcite , @xcite and later in @xcite , in order to realise mixing patterns such as tbm , without imposing ad hoc relations among parameters , the flavour symmetry should be partly preserved .",
    "the residual or remnant symmetries in the charged lepton sector and the neutrino sector are different , they constrain the structures of the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices , respectively , and eventually result in a specific leptonic mixing matrix . in order to obtain",
    "non - degenerate mass eigenvalues , these residual symmetries should be abelian",
    ". they should be subgroups of the whole flavour symmetry at the high energy scale . in the charged lepton sector ,",
    "the most economical choice is @xmath16 , and in the neutrino sector , the only choice is @xmath17 or @xmath18 , if neutrinos are majorana particles . to realise tbm ,",
    "the generators for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 are respectively given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the most popular and simplest group to realise tbm is the tetrahedral group @xmath0 , which is generated by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the residual symmetries @xmath16 generated by @xmath22 and @xmath17 generated by @xmath23 are preserved in charged lepton sector and neutrino sector after @xmath0 breaking , respectively , while the other @xmath19 generated by @xmath24 arises in the neutrino sector accidentally .",
    "many studies have been conducted on how to realise tbm and gain suitable corrections compatible with current oscillation data , for instance , see @xcite .",
    "the flavon fields play a key role in the flavour model construction .",
    "to realise different residual symmetries in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors , we need different flavons , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and require their vevs be invariant under the action of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath27 the only solution of the above equation takes the following form @xmath28 the flavon vevs are dictated by the minimisation of the potential .",
    "the latter will generally contain cross couplings between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which , although allowed by the full symmetry , would violate the residual ones .",
    "this vacuum alignment problem is a general problem of most flavour symmetry groups , not just limited to @xmath0 models .",
    "extra dimension or supersymmetry is invoked to forbid these cross couplings . in models with extra dimensions",
    ", @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be localised on different branes such that they do not significantly couple with each other @xcite . in models with supersymmetry",
    ", a continuous @xmath29 symmetry and neutral scalars called driving fields are introduced @xcite .",
    "the latter take a nontrivial charge under @xmath29 and appear linearly in the superpotential .",
    "the minimisation of the flavon potential is finally simplified to vanishing @xmath30-terms of the driving fields .",
    "these approaches can solve the flavon vev alignment problem effectively , but the price is that many degrees of freedom have to be introduced into the model .",
    "there is another solution by extending the flavour group , @xmath31 , to a larger group @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath32 should admit irreducible representations of @xmath31 such that the standard model leptons and one flavon can still transform in @xmath31 , while the other flavon transforms as a different representation that belongs to @xmath32 but not to @xmath31 .",
    "thanks to the flavon vevs and the preservation of the two discrete symmetries in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors , tbm can be generated .",
    "however , due to the measurement of the reactor angle , the residual symmetries should be broken and corrections to tbm are needed in order to render models compatible with experimental data . in most models in the literature ,",
    "this is realised by introducing higher dimensional operators , which may appear in both the flavon potential ( especially the superpotential of flavons and driving fields in supersymmetric models ) and couplings between leptons and flavons @xcite .",
    "these operators involve a certain scale @xmath33 higher than the scale of flavour symmetry characterised by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "they give rise to corrections to the mixing angles , e.g. , @xmath36 , implying that the new physics scale @xmath33 should not be far above the scale of flavour symmetries .    in this paper",
    ", we will develop a new approach . differently from above where the cross couplings are forbidden",
    ", we will allow their existence and investigate how they break the @xmath16 and @xmath17 residual symmetries .",
    "similar ideas have been mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , but a detailed discussion of how the vacuum is corrected by these terms and how the flavour mixing is affected is lacking . for definiteness , our flavour symmetry is assumed to be @xmath0 . to correct tbm in agreement with the experimentally allowed region ,",
    "cross couplings should be small , of order @xmath37 . in this case",
    ", our calculation can be carried out perturbatively .",
    "analytic relations between corrections of vevs and the flavon vev ratio @xmath38 will be derived . as a consequence , corrections of mixing angles to those in tbm",
    "are characterised by @xmath38 and the cross - coupling coefficients .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we discuss the relation between the flavon potential and flavon vevs in @xmath0 .",
    "we first point out how the size of coefficients in the flavon potential determines the @xmath16- and @xmath17-symmetric vevs , and then derive the corrections to these vevs from cross couplings .",
    "schematically , we present two flavour models in section [ sec:3 ] . in model",
    "i , we introduce only two @xmath0 pseudo - real triplet flavons @xmath39 , one @xmath0 singlet flavon @xmath40 and an @xmath0 triplet right - handed neutrino @xmath41 .",
    "this model is very economical since only 7 real degrees of freedom in the flavon sector are introduced . in model",
    "ii , we extend the flavons to complex fields and see how the mixing structure deviates from the pseudo - real flavon case . this extension is interesting since , if we wanted to draw a connection with supersymmetric and multi - higgs models , flavons must be complex .",
    "we summarise the results in section [ sec:4 ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : a ] , we list the full solutions of vevs for a single @xmath0 triplet flavon .",
    "we assume the flavour symmetry to be the tetrahedral group @xmath0 @xcite , the group of even permutations of four objects .",
    "it is generated by @xmath23 and @xmath22 with the requirement @xmath42 , and contains 12 elements : @xmath22 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath23 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and the identity element @xmath52 .",
    "it is the smallest discrete group which has a 3-dimensional ( 3d ) irreducible representation @xmath53 and in this representation , the generators @xmath23 and @xmath22 can be given as in eq .",
    ", respectively . besides , it has three 1-dimensional irreducible representations : the trivial singlet @xmath54 and non - trivial singlets @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the kronecker product of two 3d irreducible representations can be reduced : @xmath57 , where the subscripts @xmath58 and @xmath59 stand for the symmetric and anti - symmetric parts , respectively .",
    "we introduce a flavon field @xmath60 .",
    "it contains three gauge - singlet scalars and transforms as a pseudo - real triplet @xmath53 representation of @xmath0 which requires @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the renormalisable flavon potential invariant under @xmath0 is generically written as @xmath63\\ , , \\label{eq : vvarphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all the coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 are real .",
    "the conditions @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are required to achieve a nontrivial and stable vacuum .",
    "for the notation of representations and detailed expression of @xmath69 , please see eq . in appendix",
    "[ sec : a ] . to simplify our discussion , tri - linear terms such as @xmath70",
    "are not considered here .",
    "these terms can be forbidden by an additional @xmath17 symmetry ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "there are two classes of configurations that are candidates for the vacuum of @xmath25 .",
    "they are characterised by @xmath72 where @xmath73 the potential @xmath69 takes extremal values @xmath74 at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , which depend on the relative size of @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in the case",
    "@xmath79 , @xmath69 has the global minimum value at @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is just an unstable saddle point .",
    "thus , the vacuum of @xmath25 is @xmath75 . in the opposite case @xmath80",
    ", @xmath76 is the vacuum . for a detailed discussion of the determination of the vacuum of the potential @xmath69 , see appendix [ sec : a ] . from here",
    "onward , we assume @xmath79 such that the vev of @xmath25 is fixed at @xmath75 at leading order .    then , we consider another @xmath0 pseudo - real triplet scalar @xmath81 .",
    "its potential @xmath82 takes the same form as @xmath69 with coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath84 replaced by @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "all the results above for @xmath25 will apply with the substitutions @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in order to select the other vacuum alignment , we assume @xmath89 , so that @xmath82 takes the global minimum value at @xmath90 .    with the assumptions @xmath91 and @xmath89",
    ", we obtain the vevs of @xmath25 and @xmath26 at @xmath75 and @xmath90 , respectively , as in eq . .",
    "they respect the @xmath16 and @xmath17 residual symmetries , respectively , and reproduce the tbm mixing pattern .",
    "cross couplings between @xmath25 and @xmath26 would modify the vevs of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the most general lagrangian describing flavon cross couplings is given by @xmath92 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\epsilon_3 \\big ( ( \\varphi \\varphi ) _ { \\mathbf{3}_s } ( \\phi \\phi ) _ { \\mathbf{3}_s } \\big)_{\\mathbf{1 } } \\ , , \\label{eq : vmix } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 are real and @xmath94 is the only complex parameter in the flavon potential . by including these couplings , we get the full renormalisable flavon potential invariant under the flavour symmetry @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "the cross couplings will break the residual symmetries . to achieve order @xmath37 corrections to the tbm mixing , we assume the coefficients @xmath97 to be of the same order . in this case ,",

    "the @xmath94 term is the main source of the breaking of the @xmath16 symmetry in @xmath116 , since @xmath117 in this term approximates to @xmath118 , which is not invariant under the action of @xmath22 .",

    "<S> in models with discrete flavour symmetries , flavons are critical to realise specific flavour structures . </S>",
    "<S> leptonic flavour mixing originates from the misalignment of flavon vacuum expectation values which respect different residual symmetries in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors . </S>",
    "<S> flavon cross couplings are usually forbidden , in order to protect these symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to this approach , we show that cross couplings can play a key role and give raise to necessary corrections to flavour - mixing patterns , including a non - zero value for the reactor angle and cp violation . for definiteness </S>",
    "<S> , we present two models based on @xmath0 . in the first model , all flavons are assumed to be real or pseudo - real , with 7 real degrees of freedom in the flavon sector in total . </S>",
    "<S> a sizable reactor angle associated with nearly maximal cp violation is achieved , and , as both originate from the same cross coupling , a sum rule results with a precise prediction for the value of the dirac cp - violating phase . in the second model </S>",
    "<S> , the flavons are taken to be complex scalars , which can be connected with supersymmetric models and multi - higgs models . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity properties of flavons provide new sources for generating the reactor angle . </S>",
    "<S> models in this new approach introduce very few degrees of freedom beyond the standard model and can be more economical than those in the framework of extra dimension or supersymmetry .    </S>",
