    "the strategy of our proof is similar to that of dvir and gopi , except working over @xmath27 allows us to use the polynomial ham sandwich theorem ( theorem  [ thm : phs ] ) in place of design matrices .",

    "[ thm : phs ] let @xmath34 be a finite set of points in @xmath2 , and let @xmath35 .",
    "then there exists a non - trivial polynomial @xmath36 of degree @xmath37 and a decomposition of @xmath38 into at most @xmath39 cells each of which is an open set with boundary in @xmath40 , and each of which contains at most @xmath41 points of @xmath34 .",
    "this poweful tool was invented by guth and katz in @xcite to give a nearly complete solution to the erds distinct distance problem and has been applied , for instance , to give a new proof of the szemerdi - trotter theorem , the pach - sharir theorem @xcite ( see @xcite for more details ) and some variants of the joints problem @xcite .",

    "in this section we prove theorems [ thm : lines ] and [ thm : main ] .",
    "we begin with the proof of theorem [ thm : lines ] which we restate below .",
    "let @xmath0 be a set of @xmath1 points in @xmath2 , and let @xmath3 be a set of lines so that each line contains at least @xmath4 points of @xmath0 .",
    "there is a constant @xmath17 , dependent only on @xmath13 , so that if @xmath29 then there exists a hypersurface of degree at most @xmath30 containing at least @xmath31 lines of @xmath3 .",
    "assume that @xmath45 for a large constant @xmath17 ( which will be chosen in the end of the proof ) and fix a positive integer @xmath37 in the range @xmath46 ( the interesting case of the theorem is when @xmath4 is large ) .",
    "using the polynomial ham sandwich theorem ( theorem [ thm : phs ] ) , we can find a polynomial @xmath36 of degree @xmath37 partitioning @xmath2 into the zero locus of @xmath36 as well as @xmath47 open cells @xmath48 so that each cell contains at most @xmath49 points of @xmath0 and has boundary in the zero set of @xmath36 .",
    "we denote @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 since the zero locus of @xmath36 forms the boundary of the union of the cells , bzout s theorem guarantees that every line in @xmath2 intersects at most @xmath37 cells .",
    "if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 for each @xmath54 , so in particular @xmath55 by assumption , every line in @xmath3 contains @xmath4 points of @xmath0 so lines in @xmath56 must contain at least @xmath57 in the zero locus of @xmath36 .",
    "we can again invoke bzout to conclude that such a line is necessarily contained in the zero locus of @xmath36 .",
    "since what we are after is a lower bound on the number of lines in @xmath3 which are contained in the zero locus of @xmath36 , this discussion shows that it suffices to give an upper bound on the size of @xmath58 .",
    "to do so , we take advantage of the fact that every line @xmath59 has the property that @xmath60 for some @xmath54 . the total number of lines , counted with multiplicity , in @xmath2 which intersect some @xmath61 in at least two points is @xmath62 where each such line @xmath23 is counted with multiplicity @xmath63 we have already observed that a line not contained in the zero locus of @xmath36 can only intersect at most @xmath37 cells . if @xmath64 then this observation , combined with the the cauchy - schwarz inequality , gives @xmath65 therefore we get a lower bound @xmath66 if @xmath59 , then ( [ estimate1 ] ) guarantees that @xmath67 for such @xmath23 , ( [ estimate2 ] ) becomes @xmath68 since @xmath69 , it follows that @xmath70 when @xmath4 is large enough .",
    "every @xmath59 is counted with multiplicity @xmath71 in ( [ estimate0 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath72 we know that @xmath47 and @xmath73 , so we can rewrite ( [ estimate3 ] ) as @xmath74 since @xmath75 , this last equation becomes @xmath76 the set of lines in @xmath3 which are contained in the zero locus of @xmath36 has size @xmath77 and so we can choose @xmath17 large enough",
    "so as to ensure that this last quantity is bounded below by @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a set of @xmath1 points in @xmath2 , and let @xmath3 be a set of lines so that each line contains at least @xmath4 points of @xmath0 .",
    "there are constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 , dependent only on @xmath13 , so that if @xmath29 then there exists a hyperplane containing @xmath33 points of @xmath0 .",
    "we may use the previous theorem to conclude that if @xmath17 is large enough then there exists at least @xmath31 lines contained in a degree @xmath88 hypersurface .",
    "let us denote the set of these lines by @xmath89 and the set of points of @xmath0 on the lines of @xmath89 by @xmath90 .",
    "each line of @xmath89 is still @xmath4-riched , thus the total number of incidences between @xmath89 and @xmath90 satisfies @xmath91 by lemma [ lem : ave ] we may , after removing lines and points , therefore assume without loss of generality that each point of @xmath90 is incident to at least @xmath92 lines in @xmath89 .",
    "now , we call a point @xmath94 a _ joint _ if the directions of the lines in @xmath89 incident to @xmath95 span @xmath2 .",
    "if every @xmath94 is a joint , then surely the gradient of @xmath93 must vanish on all of @xmath90 .",
    "pick a component of the gradient which is non - zero on the vanishing locus of @xmath93 .",
    "this component vanishes on all the points in @xmath90 and is of degree less than @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , by bzout s theorem , this component vanishes on all the lines in @xmath89 as well , but the component is of smaller degree than of @xmath93 which is a contradiction .",
    "thus there must be a point @xmath94 which is not a joint , whence all the lines of @xmath89 going through @xmath95 lie in the same hyperplane .",
    "we know that there are @xmath96 lines going through @xmath95 , and on each such line there are @xmath97 other points , implying that there are at least @xmath98 points in one hyperplane .",
