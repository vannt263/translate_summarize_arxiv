    "given @xmath6 we consider the function dynamics defined by @xmath7    the original motivation to study ( 1.1 ) of [ 1 ] is mentioned in section 5 , but the motivation of the present paper consists in the study of ( 1.1 ) as an infinite dimensional dynamical system . for @xmath8 , @xmath9 is nothing but @xmath10-th iteration of the map @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , one might expect very much complicated and chaotic behaviors in ( 1.1 ) .",
    "however , the simulations in [ 1,2 ] for @xmath12 indicate that ( 1.1 ) can exhibit rather simple behaviors with hierarchical and self - referential structures , which we will prove in a rigorous manner in the present paper .",
    "the above dynamics can also be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is defined from @xmath15 by @xmath16 .",
    "the structure that @xmath15 gives @xmath14 and @xmath17 is evolved by @xmath14 is a key to the emergence of what we call self - referential structure .",

    "there appear finer flat parts with smaller intervals when the initial @xmath23 is larger or @xmath24 is smaller .",

    "to close the paper , we briefly discuss the original motivation in the study of ( 1.1 ) [ 1 ] and possible relevance of our result to a biological system . in a biological system",
    ", we are often amazed at its ability to change its own rule , while in a mechanical system there usually exists a rigid rule which governs the change of the state forever . moreover , the rule in a biological system is formed ` spontaneously ' , depending on the history of the state , without being prescribed externally .",
    "there a rule to drive the change of the state and the state driven by the rule are not separated initially , but through dynamics , some part of the system starts to drive other parts , and works as a rule .    when we adopt usual dynamical systems on phase spaces , however , the question how a rule is formed is not answered , since in dynamical systems , the rule for dynamics , and the variables that are driven by the rule are clearly separated .",
    "when a rule is not separated from the state , however , the rule ( that is undifferentiated from the state variables ) may operate to itself . in our function dynamics",
    ", we try to answer the problem of this self - operation of a rule by explicitly taking into account the term @xmath301 , since with this term , the function @xmath34 to change a state value @xmath48 can also be a state value to be changed by it .",
    "this @xmath302 term leads to a self - reference , since the evolution of the function @xmath20 obeys the generated map @xmath270 , which itself refers to the function @xmath303 . indeed",
    "the importance of self - reference is generally discussed in a biological problem . in our cognition , for example , external inputs are processed and are mapped to an output .",
    "the output from this process influences our cognitive process itself .",
    "if we regard this cognitive process as a function from inputs to outputs , this function changes in time following some self - reference , through development of our cognition .",
    "our study of the function dynamics ( [ eqn:1.1 ] ) was originally introduced as a toy model to study the dynamics with such self - reference @xcite , and was motivated by the search for a novel class of phenomena in a system with self - referential structure .    in the structure of section 3",
    ", we have demonstrated that evolution of some partial functions is driven by the generated map of some other intervals hierarchically .",
    "the generated map of some intervals works as a ` rule ' to drive other intervals , although they are not initially prescribed as a rule part in our model equation .",
    "these intervals to drive other parts are given by flat parts of @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , with temporal evolution of our function dynamics , the whole interval is partitioned into flat parts . in a biological system",
    ", rules are often formed first by partition of continuous inputs into discrete symbols , and these symbols provide a basis for a syntactic structure to drive other parts .",
    "this partition process is called articulation in our cognition and language ( for example , continuous spectrum of light is ` articulated ' into a discrete set of colors ) .",
    "as mentioned , this articulation process and the generation of rules over the articulated symbols are a general feature of our function dynamics .    in the function dynamics , the rule , i.e. , the generated map , can change in time , when the driving by a generated map has a hierarchical structure as in section 3 . in this sense ,",
    "the hierarchy of a rule , a rule to change the rule , the further rule to change it , ... is formed in the function dynamics .",
    "such hierarchy in the change of rules also reminds us of hierarchical structures ubiquitous in a biological system , and also in our cognitive process .",
    "furthermore , in section 4 , we have found an example in which the hierarchy structure itself can change in time , where the separation of rule and state formed through dynamics is partially destroyed .",
    "the rules and hierarchy in a biological system have stability on one hand , and plasticity on the other hand . in future",
    ", it will be important to analyze the stability of the structure we found in the paper . + the late professor masaya yamaguti stressed the importance of self - reference from early days .",
    "he often mentioned his interest in fractals in connection with the self - reference .",
    "hata and he studied function equation leading to fractal @xcite .",
    "furthermore he often discussed that mathematics dealing with self - reference is necessary to psychology , natural language , and so forth .",
    "it is to be regretted that we could not present our paper while he lived ."
