    "physics experiments at colliders have mapped production of strange hadron species over a variety of systems and energies .",
    "such measurements have commonly included production of the @xmath1 but , due to the complexities of its observation , rarely the @xmath0 .",
    "these two hyperons share the same quark content , differing only in isospin and mass , separated by a mere 77 mev / c@xmath6  @xcite . reconstructing the @xmath0",
    "requires reconstructing the @xmath1 , so comparing the ratio of yields of the two species  will be exclusive of its feed - down from @xmath0  decays , but contributions from resonance decays into both species will be included . ] provides a simple test of whether conditions are different for these two similarly - composed hyperons .",
    "are they produced similarly ?",
    "are their final state interactions the same ? without measurements , these traits may only be assumed .    above threshold energies for production of @xmath0 , the experimental data for the value of the ratio @xmath5  cluster around 1/3 , matching the ratio of isospin degeneracy factors ( @xmath7 ) of the @xmath8 and @xmath1  ground states ( @xmath9=3 , @xmath10=1 ) , as will be shown later in this paper .",
    "however there are absences in measurements for hadronic collisions at moderate to high energies , and for collisions of sizable nuclei .",
    "high energy nuclear collisions are of particular interest for the possibility of opening new channels of production via partonic degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "models often start with the production of all particles , followed by the rapid decay of resonance states .",
    "both the @xmath1  and @xmath0  receive contributions from decays of strange resonances , but those feeding the @xmath1  are much more numerous .",
    "knowledge of these contributions is pertinent to understanding the full picture , and efforts to measure these are underway  @xcite .",
    "= 5.0 in    the predictions for @xmath5  from a variety of particle production models are as follows : the event generator hijing / b@xmath11  @xcite gives 0.37 for @xmath12 gev d+au collisions ; the thermus  @xcite statistical thermal model gives 0.36 at @xmath13 mev , @xmath14 ; the  sudden hadronization \"  @xcite thermal model gives @xmath150.33 at @xmath13 mev ; and the alcor  @xcite quark coalescence model gives 0.20 .",
    "both thermal models feature little sensitivity to input parameters , as seen in figure  [ fi : ratiocont ] and elsewhere  @xcite , with nearly no dependence upon chemical potentials .    though there is some spread in the predicted values",
    ", it should be noted that the @xmath16 @xmath17 ( taken from direct production before resonance contributions ) is much higher .",
    "so the final value of @xmath5  may reflect even more upon resonance yields than the direct production of @xmath1  and @xmath0  .",
    "for example , quark coalescence treats the @xmath1  and @xmath0  equally : the entirety of their difference then results from the copious resonances  @xcite .",
    "thermal models place a penalty on production of more massive states , so they begin with a primordial value below that of quark coalescence , but have less resonance contributions to drop the final ratio .",
    "the star detector is capable of reconstructing the decay @xmath18 with excellent signal - to - noise  @xcite .",
    "reconstruction of photon conversions ( @xmath19  e@xmath3e@xmath4 ) in detector material can be accomplished similarly  @xcite , the validity of which is underscored by the ability to visualize the structure of detector material from identified conversion points as seen in figure  [ fi : svt](left ) .",
    "focusing on low transverse momentum ( @xmath20 ) photons then provides sufficient resolution to identify @xmath0  through invariant mass of @xmath21 pairs when combinatoric backgrounds are adequately low , shown in figure  [ fi : svt](right ) . to extract a yield , the shape of the background under the invariant mass peak",
    "is obtained by rotating candidate @xmath1  and @xmath2  daughters from same events to avoid mixing event classes .",
    "preliminary signals for @xmath0  have been observed via this technique in @xmath22 gev p+p collisions , as well as @xmath23 and 200 gev cu+cu collisions at rhic , but we concentrate here on minimum bias 200 gev d+au collisions .",
    "= 2.4 in = 2.3 in",
    "by using the same @xmath1  candidates in both numerator and denominator of @xmath5  , efficiencies for finding the @xmath1  cancel out and we are left with three main corrections .",
    "the first is weak decay feed - downs from doubly or triply strange hadrons , which is essentially an issue for @xmath1  only .",
    "based on preliminary analyses of @xmath1 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 in minimum bias 200 gev d+au data in star , approximately 20% of the @xmath1  candidates at all @xmath20 come from such feed - down  @xcite .",
    "= 3.1 in    the second and third correction factors are the conversion probability of photons in detector material and the reconstruction efficiency of those conversions .",
    "these are obtained via embedding simulated @xmath0  decays into real data .",
    "the conversion probability is difficult to determine accurately as it involves simulating every possible conversion volume properly , but there seems to be rather little dependence on the @xmath20 of the parent @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the reconstruction efficiency drops rapidly with decreasing parent @xmath20 , due mostly to reduced acceptance for low @xmath20 electrons ( which are found only for conversions in the gas volume of the star tpc ) .    to improve statistics , we exploit the expectation that @xmath26 and sum baryon+antibaryon counts under the assumption @xmath27 . as the number of reconstructed counts are still small and bounded by zero yield , the errors are large and asymmetric .",
    "determination of the measured ratio thus involves a monte carlo allowing values to vary appropriately within their combined statistical and systematic errors , and we report the most probable value with errors determined by the rms of outcomes above and below it .",
    "we reconstruct sufficient numbers of @xmath0  to determine @xmath5  with significance in two @xmath20 bins from minimum bias 200 gev d+au ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we find preliminary @xmath5  = @xmath29 for @xmath0  @xmath20 = 2.5 - 3.5 gev / c , and @xmath30 for @xmath0  @xmath20 = 3.5 - 4.5 gev / c .",
    "combining the two bins leads to @xmath5  = @xmath31 and this is shown along with past experiment results in figure  [ fi : pastres ] .",
    "we also find @xmath32 , which does not discount the summation of baryons+antibaryons for our ratio .",
    "the large error bars on @xmath5  prevent definitive model differentiation , but the low value suggests that strong resonance contributions are prevalent even in d+au collisions .",
