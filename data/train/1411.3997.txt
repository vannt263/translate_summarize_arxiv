    "the interaction of two point masses is probably the simplest and most fundamental dynamical problem one can conceive of in a theory of gravity .",
    "this problem is sufficiently simple in newton s theory such that it can be solved analytically . in spite of the simplifications , the newtonian two - body problem describes with high accuracy a wide class of physical systems , ranging from the planetary orbits in the solar system to the motion of the spacecraft that carried humans to the moon in 1969 . observed deviations in the motion of uranus from the newtonian predictions led to the prediction of a further planet , neptune , that was indeed identified in 1846 . for a while ,",
    "a similar explanation was considered for anomalies observed in the perihelion precession of mercury .",
    "the conjectured planet `` vulcan '' , however , has never been found and in this case the explanation came in the form of a _ modified theory of gravity _ , namely einstein s general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "gr differs from newtonian gravity not only in terms of quantitative predictions but also presents a conceptually totally different description of gravity .",
    "acceleration of objects due to gravitational interaction is no longer the result of a _ force _ but due to the curvature of spacetime itself .",
    "mathematically , the spacetime is described in terms of a manifold @xmath0 equipped with a metric @xmath1 which is determined through einstein s field equations @xmath2 here , greek indices range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the ricci tensor , @xmath6 the ricci scalar , @xmath7 the cosmological constant and @xmath8 the energy momentum tensor . unless specified otherwise , we will work in units where the gravitational constant and speed of light are unity , @xmath9 .",
    "much of this work will focus on the case of vacuum and asymptotically flat spacetimes where @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the einstein equations become @xmath12 .",
    "the ricci tensor @xmath5 is a non - linear function of the spacetime metric components @xmath1 and their first and second derivatives .",
    "the einstein equations couple space and time in a complex manner to the gravitational sources which is encapsulated in wheeler s popular phrase `` matter tells spacetime how to curve , spacetime tells matter how to move '' . as we shall discuss in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : einsteinian ] , this non - linear coupling of geometry and sources makes the two - body problem much more complicated in gr but also lends a vast richness of new physics to these seemingly simple systems .",
    "most importantly , we have the following conceptual differences between the newtonian and the general relativistic case .",
    "( i ) sources of finite mass - energy can not be point - like in gr but inevitably represent extended regions of non - vanishing curvature .",
    "the closest approximation to a point - like source in gr is a black hole ( bh ) and the two - body problem in gr therefore is a bh binary .",
    "( ii ) the interaction of the two bhs is dissipative as energy and momentum can be radiated away from the binary in the form of gravitational waves ( gw ) which are subject of large - scale efforts for direct detection . bound systems",
    "therefore eventually result in the merger of the two constituents .    in view of these special features of gr , the bh binary problem is often regarded as a three - stage process : ( i ) an extended phase of the interaction of two separate bhs , often referred to as the _ inspiral _ for bound systems , ( ii ) the _ merger _ , and ( iii ) the _ ringdown _ , a process of damped sinusoidal oscillations as the post - merger remnant sheds all structure beyond mass and angular momentum and settles down into a stationary kerr bh .",
    "unbound systems do not undergo stage ( ii ) and ( iii ) of this process but may still interact in a highly non - linear manner during stage ( i ) . the challenge to accurately model all possible stages of the dynamics of a bh binary then consists in solving einstein s vacuum equations @xmath12 , a system of 10 coupled , non - linear second - order partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "this challenge has often been referred to as the _ holy grail _ of numerical relativity ( nr ) and how it has eventually been met is the subject of this review .    for understanding the magnitude of this challenge and the particular issues arising in gr",

    "unequal mass ratios lead to asymmetric emission of gws which imparts a recoil or _ kick _ on the post - merger remnant bh of up to @xmath262 @xcite and specific spin - orientations can lead to so - called _ superkicks _ of several thousand km / s @xcite .",

    "it is well beyond the scope of this article to discuss all these features and the wide range of applications of nr simulations of bh binaries in detail .",
    "instead , we will refer the interested reader in the next section to various reviews that have appeared over the past decade and provide extended overviews of the many , exciting and sometimes unexpected developments that have been triggered by the 2005 breakthroughs in the modeling of bh binaries in gr .",
    "the 2005 breakthroughs in the modeling of binary bhs mark a phase transition in the field of nr .",
    "even though some very specific bh systems ( e.g.  head - on collisions ) had been modeled successfully before , these were few isolated and idealized examples .",
    "in 2005 , virtually the entire space of bh binary systems was opened up for accurate , quantitative modeling .",
    "the years following 2005 have sometimes been referred to as the `` goldrush years of numerical relativity '' as the community suddenly had available the tools to study a wealth of phenomena previously subject to speculations rather than precision studies .",
    "bh kicks , for example , had been known for decades to result from gw emission with potentially dramatic astrophysical consequences but the magnitude of this effect remained largely shrouded in mystery .",
    "the superkicks of thousands of km / s have been one of the most remarkable and unexpected results of post-2005 nr , a fact still in the process of digestion in the interpretation of astrophysical observations @xcite .",
    "a lot of motivation for the long - term effort of nr came from the modeling of gw sources in support of the ongoing search for direct detection with detectors such as ligo , virgo , geo600 or kagra . here",
    "the impact of the nr breakthroughs is both short and long - term .",
    "a wealth of numerical studies has been devoted to exploring the parameter space of bh binaries in the attempt to construct waveform catalogues for use in gw data analysis .",
    "the parameter space , however , has at least seven dimensions ( mass ratio and three spin parameters for each bh ) making a dense coverage in every dimension prohibitively costly from a computational point of view . instead",
    ", numerical as well as analytic studies have looked for systematic dependencies of the gw signals on some of the parameters and thus effectively reduce the parameter space to be explored numerically ; see e.g.  @xcite . at the same time , the codes have matured considerably in accuracy and efficiency and are now capable of generating large numbers of waveforms @xcite . and yet , a comprehensive modeling of the bh parameter space certainly can not be done exclusively with nr because the inspiral signal of a bh binary in the sensitivity band of ground ( or space based ) detectors typically contains many thousands of orbits rather than the @xmath263 orbits covered in numerical simulations .",
    "waveform templates are therefore constructed by stitching together post - newtonian with numerical waveforms as for example in @xcite or using _ effective one body _",
    "models @xcite and calibrating free parameters by comparison with nr predictions ; see e.g.  @xcite . furthermore , an important class of sources for space based laser interferometers of lisa type are so - called extreme - mass - ratio inspirals with mass ratios down to @xmath264 which the current nr codes can not handle ; the smallest mass ratios achieved to date is @xmath265 for a small number of orbits @xcite .",
    "these as well as intermediate mass ratio inspirals with @xmath266 require modeling through perturbative techniques ; see @xcite and references therein .    in recent years , bh binary codes have been extended to include various forms of matter with particular focus on the identification of electromagnetic counterparts to gw signals . as an example , we note the variation of the blandford - znajek effect in the inspiral of two bhs in the presence of a circumbinary disk whose magnetic field is capable of extracting rotational energy from the orbital motion of the binary giving rise to single or dual jets @xcite . other studies address accretion of matter onto bhs , the impact of a recoiling bh on the surrounding disk material , periodic oscillations in the matter due to the binary motion or the tidal disruption of white dwarfs in the field of a bh @xcite ; for an overview see also @xcite .",
    "non - vacuum spacetimes also include some classes of alternative theories of gravity .",
    "nr simulations of bh binaries have so far focused on scalar - tensor theories of gravity which are conveniently implemented in existing gr codes by merely adding a minimally coupled scalar field in the so - called _ einstein frame _ @xcite .",
    "extension of these studies to a wider class of alternative theories of gravity may be a highly non - trivial task as the hyperbolicity properties of the underlying evolution equations and , thus , their suitability for numerical treatment remain unclear for most theories ; for such an investigation into dynamical chern - simons theory see @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable developments of nr in the last @xmath267 years is the wide range of applications in areas of physics far outside the more traditional regime of gw and astrophysics .",
    "high - energy collisions of bhs may provide valuable inside into the cross section of proton - proton collisions performed at the large hadron collider to probe the possibility of bh formation as conjectured @xcite in the so - called tev gravity scenarios @xcite .",
    "the gauge - gravity duality , also often referred to as the anti de - sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite relates bh spacetimes in asymptotically ads spacetimes to physical systems in the strongly coupled regime of certain gauge theories . to name but a few examples , this duality has been used to model the thermalization of balls of deconfined plasma in heavy - ion collisions ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the optical conductivity of so - called strange metals @xcite or condensed matter systems ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "numerical studies of bhs and their formation still teaches us unexpected lessons about the fundamental properties of general relativity as for example in choptuik s critical collapse study @xcite or the surprising instability observed in the extension of choptuik s work to asymptotically ads spacetimes by bizo and rostworowski @xcite .",
    "tests of the cosmic censorship conjecture are now possible over a wide range of physical scenarios including high - energy collisions of bhs @xcite , bh strings in higher dimensions @xcite or bh collisions in asymptotically de sitter spacetimes @xcite . the numerical simulation of lattices consisting of multiple bhs are being used to model large scale structures in cosmological spacetimes @xcite and nr tools are developed for the modeling of the early universe @xcite .",
    "this short ( and incomplete ) summary demonstrates that the breakthroughs of 2005 have opened the door onto a vast garden of opportunities probably well beyond the wildest expectations the nr community has harbored during the 40 year path towards the holy grail .",
    "we conclude here with a list of suggestions for further reading on the various topics whose surfaces have been scratched on the preceding pages .",
