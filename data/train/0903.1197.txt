    "the _ cubicity _",

    "yannakakis @xcite proved that it is np - complete to determine if the cubicity of a graph is at most 3 .",
    "it was shown by cozzens @xcite that computing the boxicity of a graph is np - hard .",

    "we consider the cubicity of _ interval graphs_. graphs with boxicity at most 1 are precisely the well - studied class of interval graphs .",
    "a graph is an interval graph if and only if its vertices can be mapped to intervals on the real line such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding intervals overlap . from the definition of boxicity and cubicity , it is easy to see that any cube representation of a graph will also serve as a box representation . hence , @xmath22 .",
