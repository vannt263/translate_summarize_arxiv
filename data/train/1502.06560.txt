    "except some well - arranged periodical conformations of particle in nature , e.g. the crystal structure , lattice models are usually employed in physics to quantize the continuous space for convenient and simplified modeling@xcite . with appropriate approximation ,",
    "the lattice methodology works well to describe real systems or to investigate the physics insight , classical examples include the flory - huggins model to describe the thermodynamics of polymer solution@xcite , ising model@xcite , potts model@xcite and so on .",
    "nevertheless the balance between the lattice approximation and the space continuity of real system is always an important concern in physics modeling . among a number of sacrifices of lattice modeling ,",
    "one notable compromise is the variable angle between interacting bonds .",
    "imagine a free - arranged 2d interacting monatomic system , in which a particle interacts with four other neighbors , then a quadrilateral obtained by sampling any four neighbor particles has a random - angled conformation with variable energy , while in a regular square lattice any four neighbor particles must form a square with the angle @xmath2 .",
    "although the lattice methodology can count in the angle effect under some circumstances , for example to adjust the related bond interactions to count the effect of off-@xmath2 angle , or non - square quadrilateral with particular angles can serve as the basic unit to construct a lattice in a periodical fashion , the problem is the uniformity of lattice cells : however has the lattice been setup to fit the angle effects , the fitting must be a uniform property of all the unit cells , while ironically the angles actually exhibit the feature of randomness in real system .    according to the above concern",
    ", we developed a lattice model to handle the random angles via the unique properties of recursive lattice .",
    "recursive lattices such as the classical bethe@xcite and husimi@xcite lattice have been studied for decades and proven to be a reliable methodology to describe the real system or to approximate the regular lattice@xcite . in a recursive lattice ,",
    "the unit cells only interact to each other on the joint site and the conformation of one cell is independent , which makes individual conformation with variable angles possible .",
    "the ensemble of individually - shaped units raises a non - uniform lattice to better demonstrate the space randomness in real system . in this random lattice ,",
    "the conformation of each unit is a rhombus randomized and fixed by the program , therefore locally it has a quenched randomness , nevertheless the calculation counts and averages the statistical variables over a large number of random units to deal with the system in equilibrium at particular temperature ( details will be discussed below ) , subsequently the system can be treated as with annealed randomness in general .",
    "ferromagnetic ising model on this new lattice is chosen to investigate the thermodynamics .",
    "the first reason is that , it is a classical system that has been throughly studied for many years@xcite , we can easily compare and validate the calculation to previous studies .",
    "secondly , this is an exactly solvable thermodynamic model@xcite , and the thermal fluctuation indicated by the exact calculation imprints the point of stochasticity in an exactly - solvable deterministic system that we would like to address in this work , i.e. the thermodynamic calculation still follows a deterministic way however it gives out the randomness in the real system . and",
    "another significance of applying ising spins on this random lattice , is that we can combine the idea of spin system and structural glass model to investigate the off - crystal metastable state .",
    "since the amorphousness of glass can be presented by the random conformation of lattice , the spins can form a glassy state with their well - defined orientation , that is , a glass of spins without the concept of  spin glass \" .",
    "this model is then able to describe some particular systems , for example the metallic glass ferromagnet @xcite , in which the materials is in glassy state but the well - defined orientation of atoms gives superparamagnetism .",
    "other than the application in metallic glass ferromagnetism , we believe this methodology could be a decent contribution to this field , and has the potential to be applied in various physics problems , for example the glass thermodynamics , vibration of crystal lattice , and quasicrystal . in this paper we will explore the random - angled conformation in husimi square lattice .",
    "more specifically , the unit cell is generalized to be rhombus with only one independent angle variable for convenience .",
    "it should be easy to extend our work to be a more general quadrilateral lattice , or other polygon and 3d cases .",
    "the hamiltonian formulation and thermodynamic calculations on this lattice will be discussed in details , and we will investigate the thermal behavior , phase transitions and the effects of energy and ground state parameters setup .",
    "the conformation of a unit cell is independent in a recursive lattice , therefore a husimi square lattice can easily transform to be an recursive ensemble of random - angled rhombus units .",
    "fig.[fig : lattice]a shows the idea of the recursive rhombus lattice , the structure is still in a husimi recursive fashion but with the basic unit cells as random rhombuses . in a more general view ,",
    "the basic unit cell of this recursive lattice can be called as a conformation distribution cloud `` instead of a fixed geometry unit ( fig.[fig : lattice]b ) .",
    "the cloud '' collapses to be a particular rhombus conformation when it is visited during the calculation",
    ".     +    note that in the lattice all the edges are in the same length to represent the neighbor interactions , the different size in fig.[fig : lattice]a is for possible drawing on the plane page . with the fixed edge length",
    "only one independent angle @xmath3 is necessary to determine the structure of a rhombus . by defining @xmath4 as the lower limit",
    ", we have @xmath5 $ ] . in this paper",
    ", the angles are randomized with even probability distribution in the region @xmath6 $ ] , and @xmath4 is set to be @xmath7 .    for the angle @xmath3 between two bonds in the rhombus , we must have one or more the lowest energy angles denoted as @xmath8 at which the @xmath9 , i.e. the most stable state .",
    "for example with @xmath10 the square unit will be the most preferred configuration . in this work",
    "we will only discuss the case that @xmath8 has a single value in the range ( 0 , @xmath11 ) . however",
    "a multi - stable states system implied by many values of @xmath8 is possible .",
    "with the ground state angle @xmath8 , a higher energy @xmath12 of the angle @xmath13 $ ] rises with the deviation from @xmath8 , and then we should have @xmath14 .",
    "previous studies on husimi lattice usually consider only the interaction @xmath15 between nearest - neighbor sites , while in several works the model also counted in other interactions , e.g. the diagonal interaction @xcite . following this consideration , by safely assuming that the angle does not affect the nearest - neighbor interactions ,",
    "then if the angles would do anything on the system energy it should be either the angle bending energy itself , or effects on the diagonal interactions in the rhombus , which relates to the opposite angles with the law of cosines . since an artificial bending energy on the angle is similar to an external field applying on the lattice sites and not quite interesting , we will take the second choice to formulate the angle energy .    in homogeneous lattice",
    "the interaction energy of a pair of diagonal spins ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the diagonal energy parameter .",
    "assume the diagonal interaction is linearly proportional to the diagonal length , according to the law of cosines @xmath20 , with @xmath21 as the diagonal opposite to angle @xmath3 and the side length of rhombus @xmath22 and @xmath23 to be unit 1 , we have @xmath24 define @xmath0 as the angle energy coefficient : @xmath25 as a natural choice for the quadrilateral , in this work we take @xmath26 for the general discussion .",
    "in this way , we then have @xmath27 where @xmath28 for a random angle @xmath3 .",
    "the effect of various @xmath29 will be discussed later .",
    "it should be addressed here that the above formulation of angle energy is * counter - intuitive * because the assumption  diagonal interaction linearly proportional to the length \" implies that the farther the diagonal pairs particles are , the larger the interaction is , which is not a common case in nature .",
    "the reason of such formulation is that when we combine the energies of two diagonal pairs in one rhombus , a higher total energy ( smaller weights ) of any off - angle configuration can be guaranteed with a larger magnitude of energy change on the other term : @xmath30 . in another word",
    ", the formulation based on @xmath31 will lead any off-@xmath8 configuration corresponding to a larger energy ( lower weights ) , and the structure with @xmath32 is the most stable configuration with the largest weights .",
    "we formulate the angle energy in this way merely for convenience to preliminarily explore the nature of random - angle lattice .",
    "it should be easy to extend the methodology with other angle energy formulations for particular circumstances .",
    "adding the angle term introduced in eq.[eq : e_d ] , the energy of a lattice unit containing four magnetic energies , four neighbor and two diagonal interactions is : @xmath33 and its boltzmann weights is , @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the conformation of unit .    in this paper",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath15 will be set as @xmath36 for the ferromagnetic case .",
    "being consistent to @xmath15 , @xmath19 is always set as positive .",
    "the effect of @xmath19 variation from 0.1 to 0.6 will be discussed and @xmath37 is taken to be the reference case .",

    "the calculation principally follows the same methodology of our previous works@xcite on ising model on husimi lattice .",
    "imagine the entire lattice has an original site @xmath43 on the @xmath44th level , then the sites nearest to @xmath43 are marked as @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 to distinguish the two sites in the same unit ) , the site diagonal to @xmath43 is marked as @xmath47 , and so on .",
    "the situation of @xmath48th level is shown in the fig.[fig : calcunit ] .",
    "on one rhombus unit there are three sub - trees @xmath49 and @xmath50 contributing to the sites @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and a larger sub - tree @xmath54 is synthesized by adding the weights of the local unit . with the particular spin state of @xmath55 , define the partial partition function ( ppf ) @xmath56 on level @xmath48 to count the contribution of sub - tree to the site @xmath51 ( not included ) , then the @xmath48th level ppf is the function of ppfs on the previous level @xmath57 , @xmath58 and the weights of local unit @xmath59 :    @xmath60    @xmath61    and the partition function ( pf ) of the whole sub - tree on @xmath48th level is given by @xmath62 which summers all the weights at level @xmath48 including the spin @xmath51 .     in a rhombus unit",

    "furthermore the thermodynamics obtained from solutions also exhibit thermal fluctuation .",
    "more specifically it is possible to have a higher entropy at lower @xmath101 , which is not possible in the exact calculation on homogeneous lattices .    unless displaying several samples together on the same graph , observing the fluctuation with large temperature increment is difficult , e.g. in the fig.[fig : refsolution ] and fig.[fig : thermoref ] . in the following discussion",
