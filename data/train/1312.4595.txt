    "the exploration of the many facets of the atomic nucleus over many decades , using a large set of complementary probes , using in particular the electromagnetic ( nuclear electric and magnetic transition probabilities and moments , mapping of nuclear charge radii over large series of isotopes ) and strong forces , has unambiguously shown the appearance of the essential degrees of freedom .",
    "both , few nucleon properties ( near closed shells and doubly - closed shells ) as well as collective properties have been discovered @xcite , most often going hand in hand with the increasing technical possibilities that bring even nuclei far from the region of @xmath2 stability within reach ( see in particular chapter 1 of rowe and wood @xcite ) .",
    "a theoretical description of the atomic nucleus , viewed as a system of a nucleons ( z protons and n neutrons ) interacting through an in - medium effective nucleon force has reached important progress during the last decades @xcite .",
    "however , it looks like generic characteristics of nuclear excitations stem from the interplay of , on one side , the low multipoles of that interaction that generate nuclear mean - field properties , characterized by a nuclear shell structure and , on the other side , the high multipoles , scattering the interacting nucleons out of their independent particle orbitals , evidenced by the nuclear pairing properties characterized by an energy gap that allows nuclear superfluidity @xcite to appear along long series of isotopes and isotones .",
    "it seems that the balance between these two opposing nuclear force components , _",
    "i.e. _ , on one side the stabilizing effect of closed shells which prefers nuclei to exhibit a spherical shape , versus a redistribution of protons and/or neutrons in a more deformed shape is at the origin of the appearance of nuclear shape coexistence . by now",
    ", nuclear shape coexistence has evolved from the early interpretation of morinaga @xcite , into a phenomenon that appears all through the nuclear landscape , both in light nuclei ( near the n @xmath3 neutron closed shells ) as well as in heavy nuclei ( see @xcite and @xcite for an extensive discussion of both the experimental methods and theoretical model approaches over a period of about 3 decades ) .",
    "two naturally complementary roads can be taken in order to describe the phenomenon of nuclear shape coexistence .",
    "starting from a nuclear shell - model approach , protons and neutrons are expected to gradually fill the various shells at z , n @xmath4 ... giving rise to a number of double - closed shell nuclei that are the reference points determining shells in which valence nucleons have been allowed to interact through either a phenomenologically fitted effective interaction or a microscopic effective interaction , deduced from many - body theory from realistic nn forces @xcite . in view of the large evidence that multi - particle multi - hole excitations are observed , even at a rather low excitation energy , it is important to delineate those regions in the nuclear mass table where conditions are such that shape coexistence may show up .",
    "it turns out that it is the balance between the cost to excite such mp - nh excitations at first and the energy gain that results from the enlarged availability of protons and neutrons to interact strongly through the low nuclear multipoles such as to give rise to a `` deformed - spherical '' inversion or the presence of low - lying competing shape coexisting configurations . with the advent of a strongly increased computing power as well as of the construction of improved algorithms to determine the energy eigenvalues of very big energy matrices , a very large body of calculations mainly along series of isotones at n @xmath5 and , very recently , at n=50 has appeared in the literature .",
    "even the well - known doubly - closed shell nuclei @xmath6o , @xmath7ca , @xmath8ni , @xmath9ca , ... exhibit a number of mp - mh excitations .",
    "in these calculations , it is paramount to treat the change in the monopole part of the nuclear field ( the changing single - particle energies ) as well as the other multipoles originating from the nuclear interaction in a consistent way @xcite .    in the other approach ,",
    "the starting point is an effective nuclear force or energy - density functional which are used to derive the optimized single - particle basis in a self - consistent way , making use of hartree - fock ( hf ) , or using hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory , when also including the strong nucleon pairing forces in both cases constraining the nuclear density distribution to specific values for the quadrupole moments , octupole moments , etc @xcite . in order to confront the results of mean - field studies with the experimental data",
    ", one needs to restore the symmetries that are broken in the construction of a hf or hfb reference state .",
    "it is necessary therefore to construct states that correspond to a fixed proton ( z ) and neutron number ( n ) as well as good angular momentum j ( including k for deformed nuclei ) .",
    "these states then form the starting basis to introduce the dynamical collective correlations beyond the mean - field energy ( solving the hill - wheeler equations ) .",
    "this gives rise to energy spectra and many other properties such as b(e2 ) values , quadrupole moments , charge radii and e0 transition rates and can serve as a very good basis to be confronted with the data . besides the use of various effective forces in the hf ( hfb ) approach ( skyrme force @xcite , gogny - force @xcite ) , a relativistic mean - field approach has been formulated early on by walecka @xcite and improved over the years into a microscopic effective - field theory @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) with the gaussian overlap approximation ( goa ) reduces the problem of solving the hill - wheeler equations into solving an equivalent collective bohr hamiltonian for the full five - dimensional collective model @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used frequently with gogny forces within the framework of both standard constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( chfb ) calculations  @xcite as well as making use of relativistic mean - field methods  @xcite .",
    "a particularly well - documented example of shape coexistence shows up in the pb region . from the closed neutron shell ( n=126 ) to the very neutron - deficient nuclei , approaching and even going beyond the n=104 mid - shell nuclei , ample experimental evidence for shape coexisting bands has accumulated for the pb ( z=82 ) , the po ( z=84 ) , the hg ( z=80 ) and the pt ( z=78 ) nuclei @xcite .",
    "major steps have been taken over a period of more than 3 decades since the early work , disclosing the presence of low - lying 0@xmath10 states in the @xmath11pb nuclei @xcite .",
    "the discovery of three shape coexisting configurations in the mid - shell @xmath12pb nucleus ( at n=104 ) @xcite even accelerated the accumulation of new data since 2010 .",
    "very recent experimental campaigns have largely extended our knowledge beyond the excitation energies of intruding bands by providing information on nuclear lifetimes @xcite , nuclear charge radii @xcite , 2@xmath13 gyromagnetic factors @xcite , @xmath14-decay hindrance factors @xcite and , very recently , coulomb excitation using radioactive beams at rex - isolde ( cern ) @xcite .",
    "an important question is how these shape coexisting structures will evolve when one moves further away from the z=82 and n=126 closed shells .",
    "whereas the intruder bands are easily singled out for the pb and hg nuclei in which the excitation energies display the characteristic parabolic pattern with minimal excitation energy around the n=104 neutron mid - shell nucleus , this structure is not immediate in both the pt and the po nuclei .",
    "theoretical efforts have been carried out over the years , both exploring the mean - field behaviour , even going beyond including the collective dynamics , as well as making use of symmetry - dictated truncated shell - model calculations .",
    "early calculations started from a deformed woods - saxon potential , exploring the nuclear energy surfaces as a function of the quadrupole deformation variables @xcite and showed a consistent picture pointing to the presence of oblate and prolate energy minima when moving away from the double - closed shell @xmath15pb nucleus .",
    "more recently , hf and hfb mean - field calculations going beyond the static part , including dynamical effects through the use of the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite , either starting from skyrme functionals @xcite , or using the gogny d1s parameterization @xcite have put phenomenological calculations on a firm ground , moreover giving rise to detailed information concerning the collective bands observed in neutron - deficient nuclei around the z=82 closed proton shell . calculations in order to understand possible shape changes and shape transitions in the pb region within the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach @xcite have been improved with increasing sophistication .    from a microscopic shell - model point of view , the hope to treat on equal footing the large open neutron shell from n=126 down to and beyond the mid - shell n=104 region , jointly with the valence protons in the pt , hg , po , and rn nuclei , even including proton multi - particle multi - hole ( mp - nh ) excitations across the z=82 shell closure , is far beyond present computational possibilities .",
    "the truncation of the model space , however , by concentrating on nucleon pair modes ( mainly @xmath16 and @xmath17 coupled pairs , to be treated as bosons within the interacting boson approximation ( ibm ) @xcite ) , has made the calculations feasible , even including pair excitations across the z=82 shell closure @xcite in the pb region in a transparent way .",
    "more in particular , the pb nuclei have been extensively studied giving rise to bands with varying collectivity depending on the nature of the excitations treated in the model space @xcite .",
    "more recently , detailed studies of the pt nuclei have been carried out @xcite as an attempt to describe the larger amount of the low - lying states and their e2 decay properties explicitly including particle - hole excitations across the z=82 shell closure . however , in other studies @xcite the pt nuclei were treated without the inclusion of such particle - hole excitations .    in the present paper ,",
    "an extensive study of the even - even hg is carried explicitly including particle - hole excitations across the z=82 shell closure . more specifically , within the ibm configuration - mixing approach @xcite ( ibm - cm for short ) , early calculations were carried out for the hg nuclei in the mass region 182@xmath18a@xmath18192 , with more extensive studies extending the mass region up to a=202 @xcite .",
    "the region 194@xmath18a@xmath18202 , which exhibits no indication of intruder states was subsequently studied by druce _",
    "these studies made use of the proton - neutron formulation of the configuration mixing ibm . since in the pb ,",
    "hg , and pt nuclei , one expects the lowest - lying excited states to be described by the fully symmetric configurations , the concept of maximal f - spin @xcite can be used and allows for the possibility to no longer discriminate between proton and neutron bosons . in the present mass region , however , the intruder excitations do play a dominant role and influence to a large extent the observed structures in these isotopes ( as has been shown to be the case for the pb(@xcite ) and the pt ( @xcite ) nuclei before ) .",
    "the interacting boson model has been used and applied in the pb region , in particular concentrating on shape coexistence in the pb region making use of a totally different approach .",
    "the parameters of the ibm hamiltonian are determined from mapping the total energy surface , derived from self - consistent hfb calculations using the gogny d1s and d1 m energy functionals @xcite onto the corresponding ibm mean - field energy @xcite .",
    "in particular the pt isotopes @xcite , the hg isotopes @xcite and the pb isotopes @xcite have been studied .",

    "the even - even hg nuclei span a very large region of isotopes , starting with the lightest presently know @xmath19hg nucleus ( n=92 ) , passing through the mid - shell point at n=104 at @xmath20hg , all the way up to the n=126 neutron closed shell at @xmath21hg .",
    "many experimental complementary methods have been used to disentangle the properties over such a large interval .",

    "besides the new information on the low - spin states below e@xmath24 2 mev , lifetimes up to spin j@xmath25 = 8@xmath26(10@xmath10 ) have been measured from using recoil - decay tagged ( rdt ) @xmath27-rays , using the recoil distance doppler - shift ( rdds ) method @xcite for mass a=180 and a=182 .",

    "what is clear though is that from mass a=180 and downwards , the 2@xmath30 excitation energy is steadily increasing ( as well as the energy of the associated ( 4@xmath10 ) and ( 6@xmath10 ) states ) . the interval 180 @xmath18 a @xmath18 188(190 ) exhibits the presence of a 0@xmath10 , 2@xmath10 , 4@xmath10 , 6@xmath10 , 8@xmath10 , 10@xmath10 collective band structure with a `` parabolic''-like energy dependence on n ( with respect to the minimal energy of the 0@xmath31 state at n=102 ) .",

    "shape coexistence is a phenomenon that has become a major characteristic of atomic nuclei , all through the nuclear mass table : ranging from the light doubly - closed shell nuclei such as @xmath6o,@xmath7ca , up to heavy nuclei with a large neutron excess such as the sn ( z=50 ) and pb ( z=82 ) isotopes . in almost all cases , it was the presence of unexpectedly low - excitation energy for @xmath16 states , quite often acting as the band - head of an intrinsic structure corresponding with a much larger collectivity as compared to the regular low - lying states . in a number of cases ,",

    "this last step can seriously modify the outcome at a purely mean - field level @xcite    in the present study , we have started from a formulation which aims at reducing the huge shell - model spaces occurring in the pb region when treating proton multi - particle multi - hole excitations across the z=82 closed shell , jointly with the open neutron shell n=82 - 126 , using the interacting boson model symmetry - dictated approximation ( ibm ) .",

    "this allows us to compare with self - consistent mean - field calculations .",
    "our conclusions at this point were surprising .",

    "our ibm - cm results indicate a large difference in the value of @xmath88 for the ground state @xmath68 state ( @xmath91 e@xmath92b@xmath92 ) as compared to the value derived for the @xmath69 state ( @xmath676 @xmath93 ) , with the experimental data showing even larger values of @xmath89 for the @xmath69 state .",
    "in contrast to the experimental data concerning the @xmath89 invariant , which is a measure of the non - axial structure of the nuclear shape for a given nuclear eigenstate , and is indicative for having an oblate shape in the ground state for a @xmath94 and a=188 , our ibm - cm results are not so conclusive",
    ".    it may be appropriate to overlook the results that have been obtained in the study of shape coexistence within the context of a symmetry - dictated truncation of the shell model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ibm - cm passing from the z=82 closed shell pb nuclei , over the hg nuclei into the pt nuclei .",
    "whereas in the first two series of isotopes , shape coexistence shows up clearly at the level of energy spectra , substantiated by the large experimental efforts to disentangle finer details in the wave functions via measurements of charge radii , lifetime measurements , in - beam spectroscopy , etc , the pt nuclei are exhibiting , at first sight , a single collective structure . it looks like the coupling between different families ( 0p-0h and 2p-2h excitations across z=82 , or , spherical , oblate and prolate shapes in a mean - field approach ) in the pb nuclei",
    "is rather moderate and only shows up at the lower end of the two bands .",
    "the same mixing phenomenon appears to disturb the presence of two pure sets of configurations in the hg nuclei , this time particularly at the level of the @xmath17 states with rather moderate mixing at the level of the @xmath16 states .",
    "the behavior in the excitation energy of the two close - lying @xmath17 states , however , is changing albeit in a rather smooth way , somehow concealing the configuration mixing .",
    "this latter feature becomes dominant in the pt nuclei where the mixing occurs at the level of the @xmath16 state and results in a rather low - lying excited @xmath16 state with a particular mass dependence of its excitation energy .",
    "we are very grateful to katarzyna wrzosek - lipska , elisa rapisarda and liam gaffney for generous sharing of their most recent results on coulomb excitation ( a=182 - 188 ) , @xmath2-decay results for a=182 and a=184 and new lifetime data for a=184 and a=186 .",

    "<S> background : : :    the po , pb , hg , and pt region is known for the presence of coexisting    structures that correspond to different particle - hole configurations    in the shell model language or equivalently to nuclear shapes with    different deformation . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : : :    we intend to study the configuration mixing phenomenon in the hg    isotopes and to understand how different observables are influenced by    it . </S>",
    "<S> method : : :    we study in detail a long chain of mercury isotopes ,    @xmath0hg , using the interacting boson model with    configuration mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the hamiltonians are fixed    through a least square fit to the known energies and absolute b(e2 )    transition rates of states up to @xmath1 mev . </S>",
    "<S> results : : :    we obtained the ibm - cm hamiltonians and we calculate excitation    energies , b(e2 ) s , quadrupole shape invariants , wave functions ,    isotopic shifts , and mean field energy surfaces . conclusions : : :    we obtain a fairly good agreement with the experimental data for all    the studied observables and we conclude that the hamiltonian and the    states we obtain constitute a good approximation to the hg isotopes . </S>"
