    "in @xcite , t hooft launched the idea that confinement can be looked upon as a natural renormalization phenomenon in the infrared region of a yang - mills gauge theory .",
    "he employed the coulomb gauge , @xmath0 , in which case the kinetic ( quadratic ) part of the gauge field action becomes @xmath1 the usual ( classical ) coulomb potential is recovered as the solution of the equation of motion for @xmath2 in the presence of static charges with strength @xmath3 (= source terms ) separated from each other by a vector @xmath4 , @xmath5 he then proposed that some ( unspecified ) infrared quantum effects will alter the kinetic part into @xmath6 as a consequence , the coulomb potential in momentum space gets modified into @xmath7 which corresponds to @xmath8 which is nothing else than a confining potential of the cornell type @xcite .",
    "we made use of the well - known identity , which also allows one to define a regularized version of the fourier transform of @xmath9 , since .",
    "indeed , calling @xmath10 the fourier transform of @xmath11 , we can write @xmath12 which leads to @xmath13 of course , this is an appealing idea , at it might give a way to handle confining theories in a relatively `` simple '' way , modulo the fact that the origin of the parameter (= string tension ) @xmath14 is still rather unclear .",
    "it was argued that the coefficient @xmath15 has to be adjusted in such a way that higher order corrections converge as fast as possible @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we intent to set a modest step forward in this program .",
    "first of all , we would like to avoid the use of a non - lorentz covariant gauge fixing as the coulomb one , in fact , we should rather avoid using any preferred gauge and produce a lorentz and gauge invariant version of the t hooft mechanism .",
    "secondly , in @xcite it was assumed that the infrared effects would not reflect on the ultraviolet sector . here",
    ", we can even explicitly prove the ultraviolet renormalizability of the procedure .",
    "we also point out shall how it would be possible to dynamically realize this perturbative confinement scenario , starting from the original yang - mills action .",
    "let us also refer to @xcite , which gives a second motivation for this work .",
    "in the phenomenological paper @xcite , the issue of physical @xmath16 power corrections was discussed .",
    "such @xmath16 corrections are in principle forbidden to appear in the usual operator product expansion ( ope ) applied to physical correlators , since there is no local dimension 2 gauge invariant condensate to account for the quadratic power correction .",
    "this wisdom was however challenged in @xcite , by including nonperturbative effects beyond the ope level .",
    "next to the motivation based on ultraviolet renormalons and/or approaches in which the landau pole is removed from the running coupling , which lead to @xmath16 uncertainties when studying the correlators , it was noticed that a linear piece survives in the heavy quark potential up to short distances .",
    "this means that a cornell potential could also leave its footprints at distances smaller than might be expected . in the meantime , the notion of a short distance linear potential has also been discussed by means of the gauge / gravity duality approach ( ads / qcd ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "notice hereby that the string tension at short distances does not have to concur with the one at larger distances @xcite .",
    "we shall work in euclidean space .",
    "we shall make a small detour before arriving to our actual purpose of the note .",
    "we start from the usual yang - mills action , and we couple the nonlocal gauge invariant operator @xmath17^{ab}(x)f_{\\mu\\nu}^b(x)\\ ] ] to it by means of a global `` source '' @xmath18 , i.e. we consider @xmath19 this particular operator was first put to use in @xcite in the context of a dynamical mass generation for @xmath20 gauge theories .",

    "the covariant derivative is given by @xmath35 from now on , we can forget about the original starting point , and start our discussion from the local action , whereby @xmath36 can now also be considered to be a local source @xmath37 , coupled to the operator @xmath38 .",
    "this is however not the end of the story .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that @xmath34 must be extended in order to obtain a renormalizable action .",
    "more precisely , the complete starting action is given by @xmath39+s_{gf}\\ ; , \\label{completeactionb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we shall clarify the significance of the vacuum term @xmath40 , with @xmath41 a dimensionless parameter , after .",
    "@xmath42 is an invariant rank 4 tensor coupling , subject to the following symmetry constraints @xmath43 which can be read off from the vertex that @xmath42 multiplies @xcite .    in general ,",
    "an invariant tensor @xmath42 is defined by means of @xcite @xmath44 with @xmath45 the @xmath46 generators in a certain representation @xmath11 .",
    "is left invariant under the transformation @xmath47 which leads for infinitesimal @xmath48 to the generalized jacobi identity @xcite @xmath49 it are the radiative corrections which necessitate the introduction of the extra terms @xmath50 , as well as the quartic interaction @xmath51 @xcite .",

    "it can be easily checked that is gauge invariant , @xmath54 , w.r.t .",
    "to the infinitesimal gauge variations @xmath55 using a linear covariant gauge , @xmath56 it was shown in @xcite that the action @xmath57 , , is renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory , making use of the algebraic formalism and brst cohomological techniques @xcite .",
    "indeed , the action enjoys a nilpotent brst symmetry , generated by @xmath58 later on , the renormalizability was also confirmed in the more involved maximal abelian gauge @xcite .",
    "if we put the source @xmath59 , we expect to recover the usual yang - mills theory we started from , see .",
    "though , the action with @xmath59 , @xmath60\\ ; , \\label{completeactionc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] seems to differ from the ordinary gluodynamics action @xmath61 .",
    "this is however only apparent .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce the nilpotent `` supersymmetry '' @xmath62 , @xmath63 based on which it can be shown that the newly introduced tensor fields @xmath64 do not belong to the cohomology of @xmath65 , as they constitute pairs of @xmath62-doublets , and as such completely decouple from the physical spectrum @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath61 and @xmath66 share the same physical degrees of freedom , being 2 transverse gluon polarizations , as can be proven using the brst cohomology @xcite .",
    "in addition , the tensor coupling @xmath42 can not enter the yang - mills correlators constructed from the original yang - mills fields @xmath67 as it is coupled to a @xmath62-exact term , @xmath68 $ ] , hence @xmath42 w.r.t .",
    "yang - mills correlators plays a role akin to that of a gauge parameter w.r.t .",
    "gauge invariant correlators .    the gauge invariant action @xmath66 , , is thus perturbatively completely equivalent with the usual yang - mills action : it is renormalizable to all orders of perturbation theory , and the physical spectrum is the same .",
    "the advantage of @xmath66 is that it allows to couple a gauge invariant local composite operator to it , which is written down in .",
    "this means that we can probe yang - mills gauge theories with this particular operator , and investigate the associated effective action , to find out whether a gauge invariant condensate is dynamically favoured .",

    "it becomes clear that we need a counterterm @xmath73 to remove the divergent @xmath74-quantum corrections to @xmath70 .",
    "hence , we need a parameter @xmath41 to absorb this counterterm @xmath75 .",
    "although it seems that we are introducing a new free parameter into the action in this manner , @xmath41 can be made a unique function of the coupling constant(s ) by requiring a homogenous renormalization group equation for the effective action , see @xcite for applications to the @xmath76 and coleman - weinberg model .",
    "we now define in the usual way @xmath77 the original theory ( i.e. yang - mills ) is recovered in the physical limit @xmath59 , in which case we have @xmath78 if we construct the effective action @xmath79 , we can thus study the condensation of the gauge invariant operator @xmath69 .",
    "the functionals @xmath79 and @xmath70 are related through a legendre transformation @xmath80 the vacuum corresponds to the solution of @xmath81 with minimal energy . from now on",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to space - time independent @xmath82 and @xmath36 .    in the current situation",
    ", we shall have to perform the legendre transformation explicitly @xcite .",
    "let us give an illustrative example with a `` toy functional '' @xmath70 @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the renormalization scale .",
    "hence @xmath85 which leads to @xmath86 the trivial vacuum with @xmath87 is of course always recovered , but there is the possibility for an alternative solution @xmath88 , when solving the equation @xmath89 .    in practice , one can determine @xmath70 up to the lowest orders in perturbation theory . @xmath79 itself",
    "is obtained by substituting into to reexpress everything in terms of @xmath82 .",
    "we are now ready to have a look at the effective action in the _ condensed vacuum_. we shall find that the _ tree level _ action gets modified in the following way @xmath90\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\textrm{higher order terms}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath91 since at tree level we only have to take the lowest order term of with us",
    ".    the actual computation of the effective action for the gauge invariant local composite operator @xmath69 will be the subject of future work , as this requires a rather large amount of calculations and the knowledge of yet undetermined renormalization group functions to two - loop order @xcite .",
    "anyhow , we expect that the theory will experience a gauge invariant dimensional transmutation , leading to @xmath92 .",
    "further steps towards the effective potential calculation were set in the recent work @xcite .",
    "we did not substantiate yet the role of the extra parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we consider the case @xmath95 returning for a moment to the coulomb gauge in the static case '' . ] , it is easy to verify at lowest ( quadratic ) order that the @xmath96 sector exactly reduces to that of , by integrating out the extra fields .",
    "since we have the freedom to choose the tree level ( `` classical '' ) values for @xmath52 and @xmath53 as we want , we can always make the confining scenario work by assigning the values .",
    "the higher order quantum corrections will consequently induce perturbative corrections in the couplings @xmath97 and @xmath42 to the leading order cornell potential later on in this note . ] . at the current time we can not make more definite statements about this ,",
    "as the corresponding renormalization group functions of @xmath52 and @xmath98 have not yet been calculated explicitly , see also @xcite",
    ". the upshot would of course be to keep the expansion under control , i.e. to have a reasonably small expansion parameter .",
    "if the dynamically generated mass scale is sufficiently large , one can readily imagine to have an effective coupling constant @xmath97 which is relatively small due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "it is perhaps noteworthy to recall the possible emergence of linear piece of the potential at short distance : restricting to short distance , i.e. high momentum , might be useful in combination with asymptotic freedom .",
    "anyhow , we envisage that the essential nontrivial dynamics would be buried in the tree level mass parameter ( i.e. the nontrivial condensate @xmath82 ) , which characterizes an effective action with confining properties .",
    "one can then perform a perturbative weak coupling expansion around this nontrivial vacuum .",
    "so far , we have been looking at the coulomb gauge to get a taste of the inter quark potential . however , there is a cleaner ( gauge invariant ) way to define the static inter quark potential @xmath99 .",
    "as it is well known , @xmath99 can be related to the expectation value of a wilson loop , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "more precisely , @xmath100 with the wilson loop @xmath101 defined by @xmath102 where the symbol @xmath103 denotes path ordering , needed in the non - abelian case to ensure the gauge invariance of @xmath104 .",
    "the symbol @xmath105 is the unit matrix corresponding to the representation @xmath106 of the `` quarks '' .",
    "let @xmath45 be the corresponding generators .",
    "we shall consider a rectangular loop @xmath107 connecting 2 charges at respective positions @xmath4 and @xmath108 , with temporal extension @xmath109 .    to explicitly calculate , we shall mainly follow @xcite .",
    "first , we notice that at @xmath109 , @xmath110 , i.e. @xmath111 becomes equivalent to a pure gauge potential , @xmath112 , meaning that we can rewrite the trace of the wilson loop as @xmath113 we introduce the current , @xmath114 to reexpress the expectation value of as @xmath115 { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-\\sigma'+\\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^4x j_\\mu^a      a_\\mu^a)}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath116 the appropriate normalization factor .",
    "we are now ready to determine the potential explicitly .",
    "we limit ourselves to lowest order , in which case the path ordering is irrelevant , and we find @xmath117 with @xmath118 and with @xmath119 the gluon propagator . proceeding with , we get @xmath120 we used that @xmath121 .",
    "the first term of corresponds to the ( infinite ) self energy of the external charges @xcite , so we can neglect this term to identify the interaction energy , which yields after performing the fourier integration @xmath122 we nicely obtain a cornell potential , with the string tension in representation @xmath106 given by @xmath123 . notice that the so - called casimir scaling @xcite of @xmath124 is straightforwardly fulfilled , at least at the considered order .",
    "if we consider our model in a specific gauge , for example the landau gauge , we see the presence of a @xmath125 singularity in the ( tree level ) gluon propagator .",
    "actually , it was already argued in @xcite that such pole would induce the area law of the wilson loop , if present in _",
    "some _ gauge . in the landau gauge in particular ,",
    "lattice data have already ruled out since long such a highly singular gluon propagator , see @xcite for a recent numerical analysis .",
    "a first observation is that we presented only a lowest order calculation , based on the tree level gluon propagator .",
    "we did not consider quantum corrections , on neither the wilson loop s expectation value nor gluon propagator .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment would also have to take into account that our naive string tension @xmath14 , related to the condensate @xmath126 , will run with the scale .",
    "this would ask for a renormalization group improved treatment .",
    "we already mentioned in the introduction that the string tension at short distance ( large energy scale ) does not have to concur with the one at large distances ( small energy scale ) @xcite .",
    "we must also remind that most gauges , in particular , the landau gauge , are plagued by the gribov copy problem , which also influence the infrared dynamics of a gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the latter problem can be overcome as we are not obliged to work in the landau gauge , since we have set up a gauge invariant framework . in most other gauges ,",
    "it is not even known how to tackle e.g. the gauge copy problem in a more or less tractable way , or there are no copies at all in certain gauges . as an example of the latter gauges ,",
    "let us impose the planar gauge @xcite via a gauge fixing term @xmath127 .",
    "the gluon propagator becomes a bit complicated @xmath128 nevertheless the result is recovered , after some algebra .",
    "we already mentioned the useful supersymmetry @xmath62 , which is however broken if @xmath129 ( i.e. ) .",
    "hence , we should worry about the emergence of an extra ( undesired ) massless degree of freedom : the associated goldstone fermion transforms bosons into fermions and vice versa . ] .",
    "the situation is however more complicated than this .",
    "the starting action @xmath66 enjoys the following set of ( nilpotent ) supersymmetries @xmath130 in addition to the bosonic symmetries generated by @xmath131 it appears that a nonvanishing @xmath132 results in the dynamical breakdown of the continuous symmetries @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "though , a little more care is needed .",
    "not all the breakings are independent , as one checks that @xmath135 are clearly dynamically broken for @xmath136 , since can write @xmath137}=-\\braket{\\delta^{(2)-(4)}\\left[{\\overline{g}}_{\\mu\\nu}^af_{\\mu\\nu}^a\\right]}=\\braket{\\delta^{(1)}\\left[(b_{\\mu\\nu}^a+{\\overline{b}}_{\\mu\\nu}^a)f_{\\mu\\nu}^a\\right]}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while @xmath138 are still conserved .",
    "if a nonzero value of @xmath132 is dynamically favoured , 2 goldstone fermions and 1 goldstone boson seem to enter the physical spectrum .",
    "as this would be a serious problem , we need to find a way to remove these from the spectrum . a typical way to kill unwanted degrees of freedom is by imposing constraints on the allowed excitations .",
    "consistency is assured when this is done by using symmetry generators to restrict the physical subspace .",
    "first , we have to identify the suitable operators to create / annihilate the goldstone particles .",
    "as it is well known , these are provided by the noether currents corresponding to , which can be derived from the action @xmath66 .",
    "we obtain @xmath139 after a little algebra .",
    "let us now define what physical operators are .",
    "first of all , they are expected to be gauge invariant .",
    "secondly , based on @xmath140 we can also introduce a @xmath141-ghost charge , with @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and demand that physical operators are @xmath141-neutral .",
    "in addition , we also can request invariance w.r.t .",
    "@xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "let us mention the following useful relations @xmath146 the currents @xmath147 or @xmath148 are thus not physical operators .",
    "although gauge invariant , tells us these are not @xmath144 or @xmath145 invariant .",
    "moreover , since @xmath149 , and @xmath150 , also the @xmath141-neutrality is not met .",
    "we can assure @xmath141-neutrality by e.g. taking a product @xmath151 , but this does not ensure @xmath144 or @xmath145 invariance , which can be easily checked using .    concerning the current @xmath152 associated with @xmath134 , we find @xmath153 hence @xmath154 since the symmetries we are using are not unrelated , it is evidently no surprise that @xmath152 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 are transformed into each other .",
    "the question remains however whether we can build combinations of these which enjoy all the necessary invariances ?",
    "let us try to construct one , starting from @xmath155 .",
    "we shall use a more symbolic notation .",
    "it can be checked that e.g. @xmath156 but @xmath157 so far , we have been unable to construct suitable invariant operators .",
    "we are lead to believe that this is generally true , in return we could state that the goldstone modes can be expelled from the spectrum .",
    "an explicit proof is however lacking hitherto .",
    "in the massless case , the precise value of the tensor coupling @xmath42 is irrelevant , as it can not influence the dynamics of the ( physical ) yang - mills sector of the theory as explained above .",
    "however , when studying the effective action for @xmath158 , @xmath42 plays a role .",
    "we might see this as a drawback , as then a new independent coupling would enter the game . as our setup was to deal with confinement in usual gauge theories with a single gauge coupling @xmath97",
    ", we would like to retain solely @xmath97 as the relevant parameter .",
    "this can be nicely accommodated for by invoking the renormalization group equations to reduce the number of couplings . in the presence of multiple couplings",
    ", one can always opt to choose a primary coupling and express the others in term of this one . for consistency , no sacrifices",
    "should be made w.r.t .",
    "the renormalization group equations , therefore we shall search for a fix point @xmath159 , such that @xmath160 .",
    "we recall the result of @xcite , where it was calculated , using dimensional regularization @xmath161 and using the @xmath162 scheme , that @xmath163+\\ldots\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath164 , and we also rescaled @xmath165 .",
    "we clearly notice that @xmath166 is not a fixed point of this renormalization group equation .",
    "we must thus look out for an alternative fixed point @xmath167 .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the simplest case : we take @xmath168 as gauge group , and only consider gauge fields in the adjoint representation .",
    "doing so , we can simplify a bit by explicitly computing the completely symmetric rank 4 tensor @xmath169 @xcite , and by looking for tensor structures that can be used to construct a rank 4 tensor consistent with the constraints and .",
    "the generators of the adjoint representation of @xmath168 , are given by @xmath170 .",
    "we can compute @xmath169 , which is defined by means of a symmetrized trace @xmath171 as @xmath172_{\\mathrm{symmetrized\\,w.r.t.}\\,\\{a , b , c , d\\ } }    ~=~\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\delta^{ab}\\delta^{cd}+\\delta^{ac}\\delta^{bd}+\\delta^{ad}\\delta^{bc}\\right)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , we can also simplify the other tensor appearing in , namely ( @xmath173 ) @xmath174 using the constraints as definition of any building block of our tensor @xmath175 , one can check that the following rank 4 color tensors are suitable ( linearly independent ) candidates @xmath176 clearly , @xmath169 and the tensor are particular linear combinations of the tensors in .",
    "we now propose @xmath177 and we demand that the l.h.s . of vanishes",
    "when is substituted into it , with @xmath178 .",
    "this leads to @xmath179 we conclude that the renormalization group equation @xmath180 possesses a fixed point in @xmath181 , at least at 1-loop for the gauge group @xmath168 in the presence of only gauge fields .",
    "we end this note by briefly returning to the issue of @xmath16 power corrections . in @xcite ,",
    "these were related to ( part of ) the dimension two condensate @xmath182 .",
    "the nonlocal operator @xmath183 reduces to @xmath184 in the landau gauge , hence the interest in this gauge @xcite .",
    "although the mechanism discussed in this letter might seem to be completely different , this is however not the case .",
    "the nonperturbative mass scale , set by the condensation of the gauge invariant operator , will also fuel a nonvanishing @xmath184 condensate in the landau gauge , i.e. @xmath185 , already in a perturbative loop expansion .",
    "as such , at least part of the nonperturbative information stored in @xmath186 could be attributed to the gauge invariant condensate introduced in this work .",
