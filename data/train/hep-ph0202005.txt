    "the data of e781 experiment @xcite(fnal ) on spectra of charmed baryons as well as the asymmetries between @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and pa interactions at @xmath4 have recently amplified the results of wa89 experiment @xcite ( cern ) at @xmath9 and e791 experiment @xcite(fnal ) at @xmath10 .",
    "the data of these experiments on charmed meson spectra and asymmetries have been already considered in the recent paper @xcite from the point of view of quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) in order to understand the influence of quark composition of beam particle on the shape of production spectra of heavy flavored particles .",
    "the difference in @xmath11 spectra ( @xmath12 ) of leading and nonleading particles has been explained successfully by several theoretical models as an effect of interplay between the quark contents of the projectile and of the produced hadron .",
    "most advanced qcd models @xcite have to take into account so called `` intrinsic charm '' ( ic ) in order to decribe the high value of asymmetry between the @xmath11-spectra of charmed particles and antiparticles in the fragmentation region , @xmath131 .",
    "in qgsm @xcite and other models @xcite with elaborated concepts of fragmentation functions ( ff ) , there is no necessity of such assumption , because the specifically written ff give the asymmetries rising with @xmath11 .",
    "some amount of ic can only suppress the asymmetry , as it was shown in previous calculations @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that there is a large difference between leading effects in charmed meson spectra and those effects in charmed baryon spectra .",
    "leading @xmath0 baryon in proton - proton interaction might be produced by the `` leading '' fragmentation of proton @xmath14-diquark bringing the large fraction of proton momentum that gives an important enchancement of @xmath0 spectra over the spectra of @xmath1 .",
    "we are suggesting here to consider the spectra in full @xmath11 region : @xmath15 , so that the left side of plots always corresponds to target proton fragmentation .",
    "for example , in the case of hyperon - proton interactions the @xmath0 spectra will have two different `` wings ''",
    ": left one at the negative @xmath11 s shows the high asymmetry towards @xmath1 spectra due to the leading fragmentation of target proton , the other one in the positive @xmath11 region should have a bit lower asymmetry because the fragmentation of hyperon diquarks is supposed to have not that strongly leading character @xcite as proton @xmath14-diquark fragmentation .",
    "the asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra in pion - proton interaction should be equal zero in the region of pion fragmentation because pion can have the valent quark ( antiquark ) in common as with @xmath0 as with @xmath1 , so both spectra will provide a leading character and be equal .",
    "the inclusive production cross section of hadrons of type h is written as a sum over n - pomeron cylinder diagrams :    @xmath16    here , the function @xmath17 is a particle distribution in the configuration of n cut cylinders and @xmath18 is the probability of this process .",
    "the cross sections @xmath18 depend on parameter of the supercritical pomeron @xmath19 , which is equal in our model to 0,12 @xcite .",
    "the distribution functions of @xmath0 in case of @xmath8 collisions are given by :    @xmath20 + a_f^{\\lambda_c}f_{1qq}^{(n)}(x_{-}),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the central ( vacuum ) density parameter of charmed baryon production and @xmath5 is the fragmentation parameter of proton target diquark . in the case of @xmath0 production in proton fragmentation",
    "the diquark fragmentation plays an important role , this diquark part of distribution should be written separately .",
    "so the distribution for @xmath7 collision will include two diquark parts , as for positive @xmath11 as for negative :    @xmath22,\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the distribution at the leading fragmentation of diquarks , while @xmath24 is the ordinary part of fragmentation written with the central density parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution functions in case of @xmath6 collisions includes also the additional diquark parts :    @xmath26,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 and @xmath5 are the same density parameters as in eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the particle distribution on each side of chain can be built on the account of quark contents of beam particle ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) and of target particle ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "they are in a case of @xmath6 collisions :    @xmath30    each @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ... ) is constructed as the convolution : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a structure function of i - th quark ( diquark or antiquark ) which has a fraction of energy @xmath35 in the interacting hadron and @xmath36 is a fragmentation function of this quark into the considered type of produced hadrons h.    the structure functions of quarks in interacting proton , hyperon , or pion beams have already been described in the previous papers @xcite . in the case of hyperon beam",
    "they depend on the parameter of the regge trajectory of @xmath37-mesons ( @xmath38 ) because of s - quark contained in @xmath39 ( @xmath40(0)=0 ) .",
    "the fragmentation functions of diquark and quark chains into charmed baryons or antibaryons are based on the rules written in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14- and @xmath41-diquark fragmentation function includes the constant @xmath5 which could be interpreted as `` leading '' parameter , but the value of @xmath5 is fixed due to the baryon number sum rule and should be approximately equal to the value taken for @xmath0 spectra in our previous calculations @xcite :    @xmath42    where the term @xmath43 means the probability for initial diquark to have z close to 0 ; the intercepts of regge trajectories , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are taken of the same values as in @xcite , 0.5 , -0.5 and -2.0 correspondingly .",
    "the @xmath47 parameter is an remnant of transverse momenta dependence , it is equal to 0,5 here ( for more information see the early publications @xcite ) .",
    "it is important here to keep in mind the possibility to create the @xmath0 baryon only on the base of string junction taken from interacting proton or @xmath39 .",
    "the string junction brings the positive baryon number in baryons and the negative one in antibaryons . in the proton and hyperon reactions we have diquarks , so only positive baryon number should be transfered .",
    "the fragmentation function of string junction that can be transfered to region @xmath48 is of the similar form as diquark ff written above , eq .",
    "( 7 ) :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the intercept of string junction regge trajectory .",
    "we are not discussing here the two possible values of string junction intercept : 0,5 @xcite and 1,0 @xcite just taking it equal to 0,5 .",
    "this choice of the intercept is a reson of the target proton string junction going easier into the region of opposite z than the diquark , as it is seen from the comparison of @xmath51 asymptotics in the last formulas .",
    "it will become significant when we study the baryon spectra in pion interactions .",
    "the full list of fragmentation functions of diquarks and of string junction into charmed baryons is presented in appendix .",
    "the main difference between the concepts of asymmetry for d - meson production @xcite and for @xmath0 production is the difference between the forms of leading fragmentation functions .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 , which was taken for the leading fragmentation of valence quark into d - mesons ( see @xcite ) , is the ratio of leading d - meson density in fragmentation region , @xmath53 , to the density in the central region , @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath5 parameter is an absolute fraction of the energy of diquark that is brought by produced @xmath0 . but both parameters reflect actually the same idea of high density of leading hadrons near the fragmentation region ( @xmath55 ) of those quarks ( diquarks ) of beam particle which can go into content of this leading hadron .",
    "this phenomenon was also named a `` beam drag '' effect in some publications .",
    "the main peculiarity of qgsm is the multiple pomeron exchanges @xcite those are taken into account at the calculations of the spectra of multipartile production , eg.(1 ) . in this case",
    "the 2(n-1 ) quark - antiquark chains are connected to paired sea quark - antiquarks of the beam and target particles .",
    "the structure functions of sea quark pairs can be written in the same way as the valence quark distributions .",
    "the structure function of @xmath56-quark in hyperon , for example , is the following :    @xmath57    here , sea quarks and antiquarks have an additional power term @xmath58 corresponding to the quark distribution of two pomeron diagram that is including one sea quark pair .    the fragmentation functions of light @xmath59 sea quark fragmentation into @xmath0 as well as @xmath60 quark into @xmath1 are easily built from valence quark fragmentation functions .",
    "they are also written in the appendix .",
    "the asymmetry between the spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath1 measured in @xmath3 collisions at @xmath61= 600 gev / c @xcite is shown in fig.1 a ) .",
    "the nonzero asymmetry in the region of pion fragmentation is described on the base of baryon string junction transfer from the proton fragmentation region ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the asymmetry is defined as : @xmath62 here @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the event distributions measured in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the invariant distributions @xmath65 of charmed baryons and antibaryons obtained in pion interactions in e781 experiment are shown in fig.1 b ) with the qgsm curves calculated for pion fragmentation ( the side of positive @xmath11 ) and for proton fragmentation ( the side of negative @xmath11 ) .",
    "the ratio between the values of @xmath65(@xmath66 ) and @xmath65(@xmath67)depends on the ratio of cross sections of these two reactions .",
    "the absolute values of cross sections are not measured in the present experiment , so the left side of experimental plot in fig.1 b ) can be shifted towards the right side by the arbitrary factor , and we did it here in order to make a better description .",
    "the asymmetry between the spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath1 measured in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath61= 600 gev / c is shown in fig.2 a ) .",
    "asymmetry is high in both sides of graph because the diquark fragmentation takes place for the beam and the target particles .",
    "the invariant distributions @xmath65 of charmed baryons and antibaryons obtained in hyperon interactions in e781 experiment are shown in fig.2 b ) with the qgsm curves calculated as for hyperon fragmentation ( the side of positive @xmath11 ) as for proton fragmentation ( the side of negative @xmath11 ) .",
    "the ratio between the values of @xmath65(@xmath66 ) and @xmath65(@xmath68)depends on the ratio of cross sections of this two reactions .",
    "the left side of experimental plot is shifted toward the right side by the arbitrary factor for the better description as we did in the case of pion reaction .",
    "the complete calculations carried out with the fragmentation function written for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production give the good description of data with the value of parameter @xmath5=0,006 .",
    "in this paper we have examined the data on charm baryon production in proton , pion and hyperon beam interactions with the fixed target at @xmath69 in the e781 experiment .",
    "the following new ideas about @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra and asymmetries are to be mentioned here as the outcome of the qgsm study :    a)the features of baryon charge transfer by the string junction of the target proton are disclosed in the nonzero baryon / antibaryon asymmetry in the pion beam fragmentation region although we did not intend here to distinguish between two values of @xmath50 ;    b)@xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra in the proton and hyperon beam interactions can be described with the same leading fragmentation parameter , @xmath5=0,006 ;    c)the asymmetry is not a proper quantity to study the bechavior of baryon spectra in the region of @xmath11 close to 1 ; though the baryon / antibaryon asymmetry for @xmath70 reaction shows the good agreement with qgsm curves , the spectra of charmed baryons require more detailed description in pion fragmentation region ;    d)there is no necessity to involve the intrinsic charm into the calculations of charmed baryon spectra at the up - to - date level of experimental data .",
    "author would like to express her grattitude to prof.a.b.kaidalov , dr .",
    "m.iori , dr . f.garcia and dr.s.baranov for the numerous discussions .",
    "this work was supported by nato grant pst.clg.977021 .",
    "the concept of quark chain fragmentation function has been manifested in @xcite . the production of @xmath0 as well as @xmath1 ( @xmath71 etc . ) takes place in the central region ( @xmath72=0 ) of quark - antiquark chain with the constant density parameter @xmath21= 4,0@xmath73 .",
    "the fragmentation functions of projectile diquarks into @xmath0 ( @xmath74 and the similar ) require the specific parameter @xmath5=0,006 .",
