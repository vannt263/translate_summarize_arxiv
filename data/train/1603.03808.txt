    "pseudoknots and pseudolinks are knots and links about which we have incomplete information .",
    "this incompleteness is expressed in diagrams by the appearance of _ precrossings _ that have no over or under designation . in  @xcite , pseudoknots are defined as equivalence classes of knot or link diagrams ( called _ pseudodiagrams _ in  @xcite ) where some crossing information may be missing .",
    "we picture the precrossings that lack definitive over / under information , as undecorated self - intersections .",
    "these unknown crossings can be involved in reidemeister - like moves in predictable ways .",
    "( see figure  [ rmoves ] . )        in terms of their behavior , pseudoknots act like 4-valent rigid vertex spatial graphs ( as in  @xcite ) or singular knots ( as in  @xcite ) .",
    "the one important difference between pseduoknots and these other objects is entirely characterized by the pr1 move .",
    "the pr1 move allows us to eliminate a single unknown crossing at a curl .",
    "the reason this move is reasonable for pseudoknots is that , regardless of whether we replace the precrossing with a positive or negative classical crossing , it can be removed with an r1 move . on the other hand , vertices or singularities",
    "are not removable in rigid vertex spatial graphs or singular knots .",
    "while several new pseduoknot invariants have been introduced  @xcite , we introduce a schema for a large collection of new invariants .",
    "these invariants of pseudoknots , defined by replacing precrossings with tangles , can be adapted to serve as invariants for 4-valent rigid vertex spatial graphs and singular knots as well .",
    "in  @xcite , vassiliev showed how to extend an invariant @xmath0 of links to the class of singular links .",
    "he did so by defining the _ derivative _ of an invariant as follows :    @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4    the derivative of an invariant is an invariant of singular links with a single double - point . in general the @xmath5th derivative ,",
    "defined recursively as follows , is an invariant of a singular link with @xmath5 double - points .",
    "note that when @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the first derivative @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12@xmath4    this idea of extending invariants by taking linear combinations of invariant values for diagrams that are related by tangle replacements can be generalized ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , we could define @xmath13 recursively as follows .",
    "@xmath14@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17@xmath4    if we are careful about which invariants @xmath0 we use and how we choose our coefficients @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , this equation can be used to define an invariant of singular links , rigid vertex spatial graphs , or pseudoknots and links .",
    "note that any choice of coefficients that yields an invariant of singular links is also an invariant of pseudoknots if it satisfies the following additional relation .",
    "in general , suppose @xmath0 is a polynomial or integer , real , or complex - valued invariant of knots and links that behaves nicely under and connected sum .",
    "in particular , suppose @xmath0 obeys the following property .",
    "@xmath21    here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote arbitrary pseudoknot or link diagrams , and @xmath24 indicates a connected sum .",
    "we observe that the jones and alexander polynomials satisfy this property , among other commonly used invariants .",
    "once a suitable link invariant has been chosen , we choose a set of oriented , rational ( 2,2)-tangles , @xmath25 .",
    "recall that , since each @xmath26 is a rational tangle , @xmath27 satisfies the symmetries shown in figure  [ tangle_sym_free ] , by the flip theorem for rational tangles  @xcite .",
    "some examples of oriented rational tangles are shown in figure  [ example_t ] .",
    "+ * vertical flip * +     + * horizontal flip *     + ( a)(b)(c ) +   + ( d)(e)(f )    now that we have our desired link invariant and set of tangles , we define @xmath28 recursively as follows for an oriented pseudodiagram @xmath29 containing precrossing @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath30    in this definition , @xmath31 denotes the pseudodiagram where tangle @xmath32 is inserted at precrossing @xmath20 ( respecting the orientations of the tangles and the pseudodiagram ) , and the symbol @xmath33 is a variable .",
    "if a given pseudodiagram @xmath34 contains no precrossings , we define @xmath35 .",
    "the restrictions on our allowable invariants and tangles guarantee that @xmath36 is an invariant of singular links and 4-valent rigid vertex spatial graphs . to guarantee invariance under _ all _ pseudo - reidemeister moves , we need to further impose a relation among our coefficients .",
    "@xmath37    we take @xmath28 modulo a linear combination of the values of the link invariant of the denominator closures of each of our tangles to ensure that @xmath38 is invariant under pr1 , and hence , is an invariant of oriented pseudoknots and links . note that we are implicitly assuming that the value of our chosen invariant is nonzero on the denominator closure of at least one of our tangles @xmath39 .    to gain an understanding of why each of the restrictions imposed above is necessary , let us prove that @xmath38 is an invariant of oriented pseudolinks .",
    "we begin by acknowledging that , since @xmath0 is a link invariant , invariance of @xmath13 for classical reidemeister moves is immediate .",
    "pr1 invariance is shown in figure  [ pr1_pf ] .",
    "line 1 follows from the definition of @xmath13 , line 2 follows from our required connected sum property of the link invariant @xmath0 ( which ensures that @xmath13 behaves similarly under connected sum ) , line 3 is an algebraic distribution , and line 4 is a consequence of the relation @xmath40 .",
    "the proof of invariance under the pr2 move illustrates why our tangles @xmath26 are chosen to have the symmetries of rational tangles .",
    "a flype together with a rational tangle symmetry is required to show invariance of @xmath13 under each oriented pr2 move , pictured in figure  [ pr2_pf ] .        finally , pr3 invariance is straightforward .",
    "figure  [ pr3_pf ] illustrates how @xmath13 is invariant under pr3 since a strand that lies entirely above or entirely below a tangle can be moved freely past the tangle .",
    "this completes our proof that @xmath13 is an invariant of pseudoknots .",
    "note that we also proved that @xmath36 is a singular link and 4-valent rigid vertex spatial graph invariant . +",
    "* this tangle insertion method can be generalized beyond rational tangle insertion by asking that the tangles satisfy the symmetries shown in figure  [ tangle_sym_free ] .",
    "we shall take up this aspect of the construction in another paper .",
    "+ one obvious question to ask now that we have created a schema for creating pseudoknot invariants is : how does this schema relate to known pseudoknot invariants ? one of the simplest , yet most powerful invariants of pseudoknots is the _ weighted resolution set _ , or _",
    "were - set _ , introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the were - set of a pseudodiagram is the set @xmath41 of pairs @xmath42 of knot types @xmath43 that can be realized by some choice of crossing information for the diagram s precrossings .",
    "the number @xmath44 is the probability that knot @xmath43 will be produced if crossing information is randomly chosen , where positive and negative crossings are both equally likely .",
    "it was proven that the were - set is indeed a pseudoknot invariant .",
    "how does this invariant relate to our schema ?",
    "first , we notice that choosing crossing information for a precrossing is equivalent to inserting a basic + 1 or -1 rational tangle ( i.e. tangles ( a ) and ( b ) in figure  [ example_t ] ) , so let our tangle set @xmath45 consist of these two tangles .",
    "next , let @xmath0 be a knot invariant such that @xmath46 if @xmath47 is the unknot ( such as the jones polynomial or the alexander polynomial ) . then choosing the coefficients @xmath48 will satisfy the relation @xmath40 , since this amounts to    @xmath49!{\\hcross } ! { \\hcap[1 ] } [ l]!{\\hcap[-1 ] } } )   + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{i}(\\xygraph { ! { 0;/r1.0pc/ : } [ u(.5)]!{\\htwist }",
    "! { \\hcap[1 ] } [ l]!{\\hcap[-1 ] } } ) = \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1,\\ ] ]    so an invariant @xmath13 is determined by our ingredients , following the recipe above .",
    "the invariant we have just created with our schema is equivalent to the following composition of the were - set with @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath50    note that , if we make a different coefficient choice , we no longer recover the were - set .",
    "for instance , making the choice @xmath51 and @xmath52 would correspond to a distinct variant of the were - set where positive crossings are chosen with probability @xmath53 and negative crossings are chosen with probability @xmath54 .",
    "let us return to our original motivation for tangle insertion invariants : the derivative of an invariant . in our new framework , the tangles @xmath55 that are used to define the derivative are tangles ( a ) and ( b ) in figure  [ example_t ] , respectively .",
    "their denominator closures are both the unknot , @xmath47 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath56 is 1 and @xmath57 .",
    "notice , then , that our imposed relation @xmath40 states that @xmath58 . but clearly @xmath59 .",
    "so , oddly enough , our original motivating example is not an instance of our scheme after all .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the generalization is so valuable .",
    "it allows for the creation of many new invariants of pseudoknots just as our old singular knot invariants fail to be useful .",
    "instead , let us consider the other example we mentioned above , namely :    @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17@xmath4    here , we take tangles ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) from figure  [ example_t ] to form the tangle set @xmath45 , and we do nt yet specify values for our coefficients .",

    "we will compute @xmath61 using the bracket polynomial , @xmath62 , via the relation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the writhe of the link @xmath23 as in  @xcite , and @xmath65 is a variable .",
    "then any choice for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 satisfying @xmath66 will do , where @xmath67 is the polynomial such that @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , we could choose @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "note that this choice is equivalent to simply starting with the singleton tangle set consisting of the 0-tangle , ( c ) .",
    "let us apply this invariant to a pseudo - trefoil and its mirror image , shown in figure  [ tref ] .",
    "when we insert tangle ( c ) into both pseudodiagrams , we get the links shown in figure  [ tref_insert ] .",
    "the link on the left is l2a1@xmath71 and the link on the right is l2a1@xmath72 .",
    "both links have the same bracket polynomial value , @xmath73 , since they are the same as unoriented links .",
    "( see  @xcite , p. 151",
    "for this computation . )",
    "but the writhe of l2a1@xmath71 is 2 while the writhe of l2a1@xmath72 is -2 .",
    "hence , the jones polynomial of l2a1@xmath71 is @xmath74 while the jones polynomial of l2a1@xmath72 is @xmath75 thus , the two pseudoknots shown in figure  [ tref ] are distinct , since their @xmath13 values are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .        another interesting pair of examples , pictured in figure  [ perko ] , is derived from the famous perko pair , pictured in figure  [ perko_orig ] .",
    "let us use the alexander polynomial and take our tangle set @xmath45 to be the set consisting of tangles ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "if we insert tangle ( b ) at both precrossings in both diagrams , we recover the perko pair itself , which were shown by perko to be equivalent . on the other hand , the knot @xmath78 is obtained by inserting tangle ( a ) at one precrossing and tangle ( b ) at the other precrossing ( regardless of the order of insertion ) in both diagrams .",
    "finally , if tangle ( a ) is inserted at both precrossings in both diagrams as in figure  [ perko_pos ] , the two resulting knots are distinct .",
    "one knot is determined by the alexander polynomial to be the knot @xmath79 , while the other is knot @xmath80 .",
    "hence , the invariant @xmath13 derived from the alexander polynomial and tangle set @xmath45 ( where , say , @xmath48 ) can distinguish these two pseudoknots . +",
    "* remark . *",
    "notice that , because our pseudoknot invariant was defined using the alexander polynomial and tangles ( a ) and ( b ) with the coefficient choice @xmath48 , the were - set together with the alexander polynomial can alternatively be used to distinguish the perko pseudoknots .",
