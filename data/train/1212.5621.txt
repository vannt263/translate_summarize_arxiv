    "most of the et - based superconductors ( scs ) are strongly anisotropic quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) conductors because the conductivity is approximately isotropic within the layers of the et donor molecules but smaller by a factor of @xmath9 in the perpendicular direction .",
    "measurements of the superconducting coherence lengths @xcite within- @xmath10 and perpendicular @xmath11 to the superconducting planes in e.g. @xmath12br$ ] yield @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the latter of which is much smaller than the interlayer distance @xmath15 .",
    "this fact suggests that superconductivity in the direction perpendicular to the plane may involve josephson tunneling .",
    "low temperature properties of organic scs are known to be very sensitive to disorder @xcite .",
    "alloying with anions , @xmath16-ray irradiation , or cooling rate controlled anion reorientation introduces non - magnetic randomness into the system , however leaving unchanged , to a large extent , in - plane molecular structures .",
    "recently , the effects of non - magnetic disorder on superconductivity in organic @xmath17 have been studied experimentally in refs . @xcite .",
    "the non - magnetic disorder was introduced in these experiments via irradiation by either x - rays or protons @xcite and via partial substitution of @xmath8 molecules with deuterated @xmath8 or @xmath18 molecules @xcite .",
    "all disorder seems to affect the terminal ethylene group and anion bound structures .",
    "the measurements for samples with molecular substitutions show @xcite that the mean free path @xmath19 is longer than the in - plane coherent length @xmath10 , indicating that the superconducting planes can be considered to be in clean limit .",
    "@xmath0 was found @xcite to fall quasi - linearly with defect density , and the dependence exhibits a sharp change in slope from @xmath20 to @xmath21 around a threshold value of the interlayer residual resistivity @xmath22 .",
    "the main feature of the experiments is that the samples exhibit a superconducting ground state even at the highest defect densities , and there is not a sc - normal metal phase transition different from quasi-1d organic scs @xcite , where the randomness transforms the system into a normal metallic state . in the light of the experimental data ,",
    "the abrikosov - gorkov s theory @xcite for non - magnetic defects in non - s - wave scs seems to fail to explain the experimental data .",
    "we study in this article the effects of randomness in the josephson coupling energy on the critical temperature of weak - linked quasi-2d scs .",
    "therefore , the influence of a possible in - plane molecular disorder on the superconducting properties of the system is ignored .",
    "suppression of superconductivity in the presence of non - magnetic impurities can in general be realized by destroying either the modulus or the phase coherence of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "although strong fluctuations of the order parameter phase destroy off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) in an isolated superconducting plane @xcite , the point - like topological defects of a `` phase field '' such as `` vortex '' and `` antivortex '' of kosterlitz and thouless @xcite sets up a quasi - long range order in the system .",
