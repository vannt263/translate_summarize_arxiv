    "the scales are fixed in the present work as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we use leading order ( lo ) partonic cross sections , together with lo pdfs ( grv)@xcite and ffs ( kkp)@xcite . this ensures the consistency of the calculation .",
    "approximate nlo treatments via a @xmath1 and energy independent `` k factor '' are also possible@xcite .",
    "however , the dependence of the k factor on @xmath1 and @xmath20 can not be neglected if a wide range of these variables is to be addressed@xcite .",

    "we approximately include the modification of the pdfs inside nuclei and the isospin asymmetry of heavy nuclei into the nuclear pdfs via the average nuclear dependence and a scale independent shadowing function @xmath25 adopted from @xcite : [ shadow ] f_a",
    "/ a(x , q^2 ) = s_a / a(x ) , where @xmath26 is the pdf for the neutron .    the enhancement of the width of the transverse momentum distribution of partons due to interactions in the medium ( `` multiscattering '' )",
    "is treated in the glauber framework@xcite .",
    "we hold multiscattering accountable for the cronin effect in @xmath27 collisions , and use @xmath27 data to parameterize the width enhancement .",
    "the enhanced width is written as [ ktbroadpa ] 2av_pa = 2av_pp + c ( _ a(b)-1 )  , where @xmath11 is the width of the parton transverse momentum distribution in @xmath3 collisions , @xmath28 is the number of _ effective _ nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions at impact parameter  @xmath8 , which impart an average transverse momentum squared @xmath29 . in @xmath27 reactions , where one of the hard - colliding partons originates in a nucleon with additional nn collisions , we use the @xmath3 width from fig . 1 for one of the colliding partons and the width ( [ ktbroadpa ] ) for the other : [ pax ] e_h = d^2b t_a(b ) e_h , where @xmath30 is the nuclear thickness function normalized as @xmath31 .",
    "the thickness function determines the collision number @xmath32 as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "we obtain the best fit to the cronin data if we maximize the number of effective nn collisions at a given impact parameter at @xmath35 , and take the value of the parameter @xmath36 gev@xmath24 .",
    "in @xmath37 reactions , where both hard - colliding partons originate in nucleons with additional semi - hard collisions , we use the width ( [ ktbroadpa ] ) for both initial partons .",
    "thus , [ abx ] e_h = d^2b d^2r t_a(r ) t_b(|b - r| ) e_h , with all parameters as fixed earlier . applying this model to wa80@xcite and wa98@xcite central @xmath0 production data at sps energies",
    ", we find a reasonable agreement beyond a transverse momentum of @xmath38 2  2.5 gev , with possibly an overestimation of the data by the model in the heaviest system ( @xmath39 ) by upto 40%@xcite .",
    "this may be taken as a hint that an additional mechanism is at work in the nuclear medium , which acts to reduce the calculated cross sections . as we will see next",
    ", the discrepancy becomes more serious at rhic energies .",
    "since this effect can also be looked upon as a shift of the spectra to lower @xmath1 , i.e. jet energy loss , we study jet quenching@xcite as a potential explanation .    assuming a static gluon plasma , we use here the _",
    "average _ energy loss of gluon jets to estimate the effect on the cross sections .",
    "the fragmentation part of ( [ hadx ] ) is modified as [ jetqx ]  , where the down - shifted ( quenched ) momentum @xmath40 results in a momentum fraction @xmath41 .",
    "for the energy shift @xmath42 we use the `` thin plasma '' ( glv ) approximation@xcite , appropriate for small values of the opacity @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the average thickness of the static medium and @xmath45 denotes the gluon mean free path . one important feature distinguishing",
    "the glv energy loss from the `` thick plasma '' ( bdms ) limit@xcite is the approximately constant fractional energy loss ( @xmath46 ) of gluons as a function of jet energy @xmath47 in the range @xmath48 gev@xcite .    in fig .",
    "the results of this calculation are compared to recent @xmath0 spectra measured by phenix @xcite for values of the opacity @xmath49 .",
    "it can be seen that , while the semi - peripheral spectrum displays only a weak ( but non - vanishing ) influence of jet - quenching characterized by @xmath50 1  1.5 , in the central case a much larger effective opacity of @xmath50 3  4 is required for agreement between the data and pqcd calculations @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that fluctuations in jet energy loss reduce the suppression , but their net effect can be absorbed in a rescaling of the opacity @xmath51 .",
    "first results on an approximate treatment of fluctuations and on a dynamical calculation are reported in the next talk@xcite .",
    "the average opacity @xmath51 can be related to the density of the plasma using the expression of the transport coefficient in terms of @xmath52 @xcite . using this correspondence implies a very high initial gluon density for @xmath50 3 in a static plasma .",
    "taking into account the rapid transverse collective expansion of the plasma leads to somewhat reduced gluon densities , @xmath53 , and to results on the collective flow consistent with the preliminary data@xcite . by any reasonable estimate",
    "these gluon densities indicate that strongly - interacting matter has reached the deconfined region in the analyzed nuclear collisions .",
    "jet quenching is needed on the background of a pqcd calculation augmented by the nuclear effects of shadowing and multiscattering to bring the calculated results in agreement with the phenix data on @xmath0 spectra from @xmath4 at @xmath23 130 gev .",
    "the amount of required jet energy loss indicates a dense gluon plasma , well in the deconfined region .",
    "jet quenching is a powerful diagnostic tool to study strongly - interacting matter in nuclear collisions , which will play an important role in analyzing the 2001 rhic data at @xmath23 200 gev , and beyond .",
