    "as the principal sites of star formation in the local universe , molecular clouds demand much observational and theoretical attention .",
    "their structure is extremely complex , driven by the interaction of supersonic turbulence , gravity , and magnetic fields ( e.g. mac low & klessen 2004 ; elmegreen & scalo 2004 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ; chapman et al 2011 ; heyer & brunt 2012 ) .",
    "theoretical descriptions of molecular clouds must begin with the structure of the relevant physical fields ( density , velocity , etc ) in three dimensions ( 3d ) , while our practical information is necessarily restricted to what can be measured from the projection of these fields onto the observational axes  two spatial and , for spectral line data , one ( line - of - sight ) velocity component .",
    "it is a crucially important , yet challenging , problem to relate the projected fields to intrinsic properties of the 3d physical fields .",
    "only limited information about the 3d density field , @xmath2 , can be derived via analysis of the projected 2d column density field , @xmath3 , which is observationally obtained by extinction measurements , dust emission , or integrated spectral line intensities . for the latter",
    ", we may be aided by ( or perhaps limited by ) density - selectivity of particular molecular transitions , yet molecular line emission is the only source of information for studying the dynamics of molecular clouds .",
    "arguably the most useful property of @xmath3 is that its fourier transform , @xmath4 , is directly proportional to a 2d slice through the fourier transform of the density field , @xmath5 , where the line - of - sight wavevector , @xmath6 ; i.e. @xmath7 .",
    "this allows , under the assumption of isotropy , the density power spectrum to be derived ( e.g. stutzki et al 1998 ) , the 3d density variance to be inferred ( fischera & dopita 2004 ; brunt , federrath , & price 2010(a ) ; hereafter bfp ) , and an estimate of the 3d density pdf to be constructed ( brunt , federrath , & price 2010(b ) ) .",
    "the essence of the bfp method ( relating the 2d normalised column density variance to the 3d normalised density variance ) lies in determining the fraction of variance contained in a single 2d slice of the 3d power spectrum .",
    "while bfp focused primarily on a method to relate density and column density statistics , they also presented a brief outline of the same method applied to velocity fields , though noting that the natural observational density - weighting of the velocity field would potentially cause problems . in this paper , we present an extended development of the outline method presented in bfp , subject to two key modifications .",
    "firstly , the density - weighting of the velocity field means that the physical field suitable for bfp - like analysis is the `` momentum density '' field , @xmath0 , rather than the velocity field alone .",
    "secondly , the realisation that only transverse ( solenoidal ) modes ( for which @xmath1 ) are projected into 2d allows us to extend the bfp method to estimate the fraction of momentum density power that is held in solenoidal modes , if given an estimate of the total momentum density power ( through a spectral line imaging observation ) .",
    "the ideas underpinning the extended method are presented below , along with a demonstration of its applicability using numerical simulations of turbulent clouds .",
    "the method as presented assumes statistical isotropy , so should not be applied to clouds for which significant anisotropy is observed or suspected due to ( e.g. ) the presence of a strong magnetic field at low mach numbers ( bfp ) .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we present the method for observationally estimating the fraction of momentum power in transverse modes , after first introducing the background considerations necessary for its formulation . in section  3",
    ", we describe the numerical simulations to be used for testing purposes . in section  4 ,",
    "we test the method by applying it to the numerical simulations , followed by a discussion ( section 5 ) and summary ( section 6 ) . in the appendix",
    "we examine statistical aspects of density  velocity correlation , which has a small effect on the method .",
    "in this section we discuss geometrical properties of divergence  free ( `` transverse '' or `` solenoidal '' ) and curl  free ( `` longitudinal '' or `` compressible '' ) modes in a general vector field ( section 2.1 ) , before considering the consequences of projection of such a field from 3d to 2d ( section 2.2 ) . in the following",
    "we will use transverse / solenoidal and longitudinal / compressible to refer respectively to divergence  free and curl  free components .",
    "subsequently , we identify the momentum field as the most relevant physical field of interest for quantitative analysis and develop a method by which the fraction of power in transverse momentum modes may be estimated observationally ( section 2.3 ) .",
    "the helmholtz decomposition theorem ( helmholtz 1858 ) states that , as a function of position @xmath8 , an arbitrary 3d vector field , @xmath9 , can be represented as the sum of a purely transverse field , @xmath10 , and a purely longitudinal field , @xmath11 : @xmath12 where : @xmath13 @xmath14 in fourier space , the equivalent relations to equations  ( [ dot1 ] ) and ( [ cross1 ] ) are ( using a tilde to represent the fourier transformed fields ) : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 are wavevectors , and the fourier transformed field is defined , over a cubical spatial region of length @xmath19 on each axis , by : @xmath20    in the following , we will assume that a reference frame can be chosen in which @xmath21 , so that the spatial average , @xmath22 , is equal to the field variance , @xmath23 .",
    "it is possible , making use of parseval s theorem , to calculate the field variances via fourier space using : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 note that the _ local _ orthogonality of @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( ensuring that @xmath29 ) does not mean that the direct space fields @xmath30 and @xmath31 are also locally orthogonal . that is , at any single field point , we have : @xmath32 since in general @xmath33 _",
    "locally_. however , this dot product vanishes when averaged over the entire space containing @xmath34 .",
    "( this is required by parseval s theorem , expressed in equations  ( [ parseval1][parseval2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath35 is satisfied at each point in fourier space , so that @xmath36 , provided the averages are computed in the @xmath21 frame , as we have assumed . )",
    "the helmholtz decomposition ( equation  ( [ helmholtzdec ] ) ) is unique , up to a vector constant , provided that the field @xmath37 falls to zero on its outer boundary .",
    "more generally , @xmath37 could in principle contain a contribution from a curl  free , divergence  free component , @xmath38 , given by the gradient of a scalar harmonic field @xmath39 that satisfies the laplace equation ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "specifically , the curl  free nature of @xmath38 follows from its definition as the gradient of a scalar , while its divergence  free nature requires that @xmath39 satisfies the laplace equation . as a harmonic field",
    ", @xmath39 must obey the mean value theorem , i.e. that its value at any point @xmath41 is equal to its average on any spherical surface of arbitrary radius surrounding @xmath41 .",
    "this means that @xmath39 can contain no _ local _ maxima or minima , and therefore that any maxima / minima must occur on its outer boundary .",
    "the properties of @xmath39 are therefore determined entirely by boundary conditions : @xmath42 will quantify large - scale , smooth gradients in @xmath37 that can not be assigned to either @xmath30 or @xmath31 .    for our study here , we use numerically simulated fields ( with the momentum density @xmath0 playing the role of @xmath37 ) that obey periodic boundary conditions . for these fields , the multiplicity of choices for the `` boundary '' and the condition of no local maxima / minima ensure that @xmath39 is a constant and therefore that @xmath43 , and the helmholtz decompositon is unique . for real momentum fields encountered in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , we must rely on finding clouds that are sufficiently isolated that boundary conditions on @xmath0 are not a concern .",
    "our method is therefore best - suited to molecular clouds that are bounded in space ( i.e. by a fall  off in density @xmath44 that ensures no non - zero @xmath0 values on their boundary ) .",
    "the more widely - distributed atomic medium is less suited to application of our method , since it will be difficult to ensure the absence of large - scale gradients in any finite field .",
    "finally , it should be noted that @xmath0 will be continuous across the atomic / molecular transition and restriction to the molecular component is a necessarily limited description of the ism as a single fluid  not to mention restriction to practically - observable regions using trace molecules , and the possible influence of inter - mixed atomic / molecular zones .",
    "however , these problems are not in principle insurmountable ( with sufficient data ) though they may pose considerable challenges if a complete description of the ism fluid is desired .",
    "consider the case where we have access to only one scalar component of the vector field @xmath34 .",
    "we assume that the accessible component is oriented along the line - of - sight ( as in , for example , a spectral line observation ) , which we take as the @xmath45-direction .",
    "the observable component of @xmath34 is then @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the @xmath45 components of the transverse and longitudinal parts of @xmath34 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath49 to the fourier transformed field  @xmath50  is @xmath51 and this is oriented along the @xmath52-direction ( i.e. @xmath53 transforms into @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are unit vectors in the @xmath45 and @xmath52 directions respectively ) .        the condition @xmath57 requires that @xmath58 along the @xmath52 axis ( where @xmath59 ) . clearly we must also find that @xmath60 everywhere in the plane @xmath6 , since there the condition @xmath61 requires that @xmath62 in this plane .    in this paper , we only consider fields for which the transverse and longitudinal fields , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are statistically isotropic , i.e. that their power spectra ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) may be written as functions of @xmath65 alone , with no explicit angular dependence in fourier space . in this case",
    ", we may write : @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are scaling factors and @xmath70 and @xmath71 describe the @xmath72-dependent power distributions . note that",
    "for such isotropic fields the transverse and longitudinal power distributions for a single scalar component are not isotropic , but have predictable anisotropic structure determined by the following equations : @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 it is worth briefly mentioning here that , as can be checked in the above equations , the individual scalar components of the vector field are only fully isotropic if , at each @xmath79 , we have @xmath80  @xmath81  @xmath82  @xmath83  @xmath84 .",
    "this is the case for ( e.g. ) fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) fields - i.e. there is twice as much power in the transverse component as the longitudinal component . in general",
    ", this will not be true .    to illustrate the above power spectra , we show example 3d renderings of @xmath85 and @xmath86 in figure  [ fig : powplot0 ] .",
    "isotropic power spectra of @xmath87 , and @xmath88 have been assumed .",
    "the power spectrum of the longitudinal component of @xmath49 has a characteristic `` hourglass '' appearance , resulting from the suppression ( nulling ) of power near ( at ) @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath89 is aligned with @xmath90 , this means that @xmath91 must be zero in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "conversely , the transverse power is maximized ( at fixed @xmath72 ) in the plane @xmath6 , and diminishes as @xmath92 approaches unity .",
    "an instructive reference point can be obtained by considering the power distributions along the line ( @xmath93 ) . here , the longitudinal power is entirely contained in the @xmath45-component , while the transverse power is equally split ( assuming isotropy ) between the @xmath94-component and the @xmath95-component ( equations  ( [ fxtin3d ] ) and ( [ power2 ] ) with @xmath59 ) .",
    "the power spectra of the other ( @xmath96 ) components share the same form , but with different orientations , such that ( as we assume here ) the total transverse and longitudinal power spectra are isotropic ( functions of @xmath72 alone ) : @xmath97 @xmath98 as can be checked by equations  ( [ ftkiso][power2 ] ) . in practice , power spectra , whether observed or simulated , will not be _ precisely _ isotropic but we assume that they are statistically isotropic  i.e .",
    "that the power values fluctuate randomly around the form assumed above .",
    "note that if the isotropy is only statistical , the geometry still requires that @xmath51 has no longitudinal power in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "an important property of the above power distributions is that in the plane @xmath6 : @xmath99 it is straightforward to show that if @xmath49 is spatially averaged over the @xmath45-axis via : @xmath100 then the fourier transform of the line - of - sight averaged field , @xmath101 , is given by : @xmath102 ( see bfp ) .",
    "this means that the projected field , @xmath101 , contains only contributions from transverse structure in 3d , since its fourier transform is directly proportional to a @xmath6 cut through the 3d fourier transform of @xmath49 ( which contains only transverse contributions ) .",
    "therefore , its power spectrum is a direct measure of the @xmath6 plane of the 3d power spectrum of @xmath47 ( and , indeed , of @xmath30 ) . the power spectrum , as a representation of the variance of @xmath101 , can be used to obtain an estimate of the variance of @xmath47 in 3d , if the power spectra conform to the structures given in equations  ( [ power1][power2 ] ) .",
    "explicitly , the power spectrum of @xmath101 is , for @xmath6 : @xmath103    using parseval s theorem , and referring to equation  ( [ fztin3d ] ) , the variance of @xmath101 is given by : @xmath104 or making use of equation  ( [ projfz ] ) : @xmath105 the variance of @xmath47 in three dimensions is given by : @xmath106 so that , under the assumption of isotropy ( i.e. equation  ( [ ftkiso ] ) ) , we may then use the measured variance of @xmath101 to estimate the variance of @xmath47 in three dimensions via : @xmath107 where we note that @xmath70 can be directly measured using the power spectrum of the projected field , @xmath108 .",
    "the overall scaling of the fields ( controlled by @xmath109 in equation  ( [ ftkiso ] ) ) is unimportant in determining the _ ratio _ @xmath110 but _ is _ important if the absolute variance @xmath111 is desired .",
    "even more straightforwardly , noting that for an isotropic field , @xmath112 , we can also write : @xmath113    if , in addition , a measurement of the total variance of @xmath49 is available , then the fractional power in transverse modes can be calculated .",
    "even if only the ratio of projected - to - total variance , @xmath114 , is known , the fractional power in transverse modes can still be calculated via : @xmath115 or : @xmath116 and again under the assumption of isotropy , this should be equal to the fractional power in transverse modes for the full vector field @xmath34 , i.e. : @xmath117 note that there is no requirement that the longitudinal power spectrum to be known , nor be in any way dependent on the transverse power spectrum .",
    "a simpler version of equation  ( [ mastereq ] ) was used by bfp to estimate the variance of normalised density , @xmath118 from the observationally accessible normalised column density variance @xmath119 ( where @xmath44 and @xmath120 are density and column density , and @xmath121 and @xmath122 are their mean values , respectively ) .",
    "the appropriately modified form of equation  ( [ mastereq ] ) for this purpose is : @xmath123 where it was assumed that the density power spectrum was isotropic , described by the function @xmath124 , and the mean value of the fields ( i.e. the zero - frequency component @xmath125 ) is explicitly subtracted from the summations .",
    "above we had assumed that a frame could be chosen in which @xmath21 , whereas bfp used the positive - definite nature of @xmath44 and @xmath120 to provide a suitable normalisation . obviously , equation  ( [ mastereq2 ] ) does not include the @xmath126 factor either , since @xmath44 is a scalar and not subject to the vector projection factors that determine @xmath47 .",
    "for practical application of equations  ( [ mastereq]-[mastereq2 ] ) the sums only extend to the maximum wavevector observable in the field , the consequences of which are discussed in bfp and brunt ( 2010 ) .",
    "we now review the information provided by spectral line observations of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , with a view to determining which physical field(s ) may be analysed by the above system .",
    "the principal requirements for such a field are ( 1 ) that it is a 3d vector field , and ( 2 ) that one of its components can be projected ( or averaged ) over the line - of - sight with no weighting by other variable physical fields .",
    "it turns out , as explained below , that the momentum density field , @xmath127 , ( hereafter simply `` momentum '' ) most closely satisfies these requirements .",
    "application of the method to velocity fields is impossible except under conditions of uniform density , which are essentially never encountered in the ism .",
    "below we therefore develop a scheme whereby the fraction of momentum power in transverse modes may be estimated observationally ",
    "i.e. evaluation of equation  ( [ mastereqa ] ) .",
    "here we only consider an optically thin isothermal medium with uniform excitation , so that the infinitesimal contribution to the spectral line intensity generated by density @xmath44 along an infinitesimal path length @xmath128 at position @xmath45 is given by : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a constant and @xmath131 is the normalised profile function , which can usually be represented by a gaussian : @xmath132 where @xmath133 represents the dispersion caused by thermal and instrumental broadening . integrating along the line - of - sight , the observed spectral line intensity is then : @xmath134 where we have assumed the emitting medium lies within a region of spatial size @xmath19 . for molecular spectral line observations , @xmath133 is usually very small compared to the overall velocity dispersion , so that a reasonable approximation is @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the dirac delta function . in this case ,",
    "equation  ( [ dwvhist ] ) effectively describes the intensity as a `` density - weighted histogram '' of line - of - sight velocity , and indeed this is a standard method to represent optically - thin spectral line observations of numerical simulations ( e.g. falgarone et al 1994 ; ostriker , stone , & gammie 2001 ) .",
    "( note that the delta function may be satisfied multiple times along the line - of - sight for a turbulent medium . )    with @xmath135 , consider the observationally - accessible integral ( the first velocity - moment of the intensity ) : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the @xmath45-component of the momentum , and @xmath139 is ( c.f .",
    "equation  ( [ zproject ] ) ) : @xmath140 the momentum field therefore satisfies the spatial projection requirement ( up to constants of proportionality ) , while the velocity field does so only under conditions of uniform density .",
    "therefore in equation  ( [ mastereqa ] ) we will set @xmath141 and @xmath142 .    at this point",
    ", we identify the following ratio : @xmath143  i.e. the fraction of @xmath45-momentum power ( variance ) projected into 2d  as the most relevant quantity to estimate observationally , since measurements of @xmath143 and @xmath70 are needed for the evaluation of equation  ( [ mastereqa ] ) .",
    "we already have @xmath70 , as this can be derived from the angular average of the power spectrum of @xmath144 ( note that the overall normalisation is unimportant ) .    while @xmath130 and @xmath19 ( in equation  ( [ pzpeq ] ) ) can in principle be estimated , a better procedure is to normalise them out .",
    "the integrated intensity ( the zeroth velocity - moment of the intensity ) is : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the line - of - sight average of @xmath44 ( @xmath147 is the column density ) .    by computing spatial averages over @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( denoted by angle brackets ) the ratio : @xmath148 can be formed , where we have assumed the calculations are done in the zero - momentum frame ( @xmath149 , or equivalently , @xmath150 ) .",
    "we review now what remains to be calculated in order to form the ratio @xmath143 needed for application of equation  ( [ mastereqa ] ) .",
    "as is evident from the dimensionality of @xmath151 , it turns out that a measurement of its 3d analogue , @xmath152 , is the most useful way to proceed .",

    "it is also important to recognise that a finite - width thermal / instrumental broadening term will cause overestimation of @xmath171 .",

    "we do not recommend that the method is applied practically to subsonic media , but expect instead that it will be applied to large molecular clouds where the thermal broadening has a small influence on the dominant supersonic turbulent motions .",

    "we have made a further assumption here , which is : the use of equation  ( [ epsiloninfinity ] ) assumes the hydrodynamic limit , since the fit was made to simulations that did not include magnetic fields .",
    "there is an apparent dependence of @xmath178 on the alfvnic mach number ( see figure  [ fig : evsma ] ) but this is only important in the limit @xmath236 and low sonic mach number ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "we assume that auxiliary observations have been made to ensure that these conditions are not met , though the consequences of erroneously assuming they are not met when in fact they are ( at least within the range of conditions covered by the above analysis ) are not severe . in the low @xmath238 , low @xmath235 regime ,",

    "we have already mentioned accounting for the contribution of noise variance to @xmath249 , and it remains to deal with the role of noise in calculating @xmath250 , which is a bit more complicated .",
    "we just mention here that prescriptions for accounting for noise in centroid velocity measurements are available ( e.g. kleiner & dickman 1985 ; miesch & bally 1994 ; brunt & mac low 2004 ) and a suitable modification of these should be made .",
    "now with all three terms in equation  ( [ allofit ] ) assembled , we can construct an observationally - accessible estimate of @xmath251 ( i.e. the fraction of @xmath45-momentum power projected into 2d ) for comparison with the same `` true '' quantity directly extracted from the data with privileged access .",
    "figure  [ fig : projdata ] shows this comparison , ( a ) without and ( b ) with the correction factor @xmath175 applied . in general , equation  ( [ allofit ] ) provides an accurate observational measure of the ratio @xmath251 .",
    "note that there are two main effects that control this ratio .",
    "first , if the fraction of compressive ( longitudinal ) momentum modes is high , then the ratio @xmath251 will be low since only transverse modes are projected into 2d .",
    "this is ( partially ) why the compressively - forced simulations display small values of @xmath251 .",
    "second , a higher density variance will typically result in a lower fraction of momentum variance projected into 2d since such fields suffer more averaging / smoothing of small - scale structure ( e.g. as mentioned above in the discsussion of figure  [ fig : ndr ] ) .",
    "this means that even though the transverse momentum fractions are approximately the same at high mach numbers regardless of the forcing mechanism ( see figure  [ fig : tfrac ] ) the compressive forcing drives higher density variance ( federrath et al 2008 ) which results in a greater degree of line - of - sight averaging of small - scale structure , and therefore lower values of @xmath251 .",
    "the highest values of @xmath251 reached ( @xmath252 ) originate from the subsonic solenoidally - forced simulations which have very nearly uniform density . in this case , trivially , @xmath253  1/3 of the momentum variance is projected along one of the three spatial axes .",
    "the final step in the analysis is the de - projection via equation  ( [ allofit2 ] ) to estimate the fraction of momentum power in transverse modes in 3d ( assuming that @xmath254 ) .",
    "the input to the de - projection factor is just @xmath70 , obtained from the angular average of the power spectrum of @xmath255 . in an observational context",
    "this should be corrected for noise ( using a suitable modification of the methods in brunt & mac low 2004 or brunt 2010 ) and treatment of the effect of the telescope beam pattern should be included ( see bfp for a discussion of this ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : finalplot2 ] we compare the observationally derived values of @xmath224 to those measured exactly with privileged access to the momentum field in 3d .",
    "figure  [ fig : finalplot2](a ) shows the comparison with no statistical correction for density - velocity corrlation , while figure  [ fig : finalplot2](b ) shows the results with the @xmath175 correction applied ( we have applied the correction to all data , not just the supersonic fields ) . in the plots , the plotted points are the mean values of @xmath224 obtained by averaging the results over all 3 spatial axes ,",
    "while the error bars represent the standard deviation about the mean .",
    "this is to show the recovery of @xmath224 from the same field seen from different orientations .",
    "overall , the observational recovery of the intrinsic @xmath224 values is good , albeit with relatively large scatter for the high mach number compressively - forced simulations .",
    "though the solenoidally - forced simulations alone span a limited range in @xmath224 , the recovery is reliable , albeit with a slight overestimation for intrinsic @xmath256 ( applicable to the subsonic , @xmath253  uniform density fields ) .",
    "if the turbulence was strongly magnetized ( i.e. @xmath257 , @xmath258 ) , but assumed not to be , then the @xmath175 factors derived from @xmath239 would lead to slighty over - estimated solenoidal fractions , though for the range of mach numbers studied here , this is only at the @xmath253  10% level .",
    "this should be tested directly in future studies , where the ( probably ) more important question of anistropy should be assessed .",
    "while the simulated fields here contain a number of idealisations ( fourier - space driving , periodic boundary conditions , lack of self - gravity , strict isothermality ) the above analysis has demonstrated that , in principle , the fraction of momentum power in transverse ( solenoidal ) modes , @xmath224 , may be measureable from observations .",
    "( we have outlined practical observational considerations at appropriate points above . ) for the subsonic fields , to extend the range of intrinsic @xmath224 available , we have assumed ( unrealistically ) that the dominant thermal broadening terms have been accounted for .",
    "we envision that the above method is best - suited to the study of nearby supersonically - turbulent molecular clouds for which high sensitivity , high spatial dynamic range spectral line data are available .",
    "so , how relevant are the simulated supersonic fields to typical conditions met in molecular clouds that ( currently ) could be analysed with the above model ?",
    "we argue that the key condition that must be satisfied is that of statistical isotropy , rather than any shortcomings in the physical simulations  i.e. the simulations simply create an intrinsic ratio @xmath224 that we can set out to measure .",
    "if strong magnetic fields are present , then this could cause significant anisotropy in the density and velocity fields that we have not accounted for here .",
    "the assumption of isothermality may be slightly problematic , since the method relies ( weakly ) on applying corrections for thermal broadening and deriving the mach number ( to estimate @xmath175 ) .",
    "the assumption of a single mach number is also problematic if the method is to be applied to the atomic ism .",
    "it is also possible of course that the detailed physics may affect the statistical correction factors @xmath175 , a point to which we will return below .",
    "the next steps in the testing of the method should focus on possible complications and biases induced by anisotropies .",
    "in fact , there are suggestions that compressive modes may be suppressed in highly anistropic media ( hansen , mckee , & klein 2011 ) , which would be very interesting to test observationally once the practicalities of doing so are understood more fully . testing ( or extension ) of the method to mhd case with different compressive / solenoidal fractions is also worth pursuing .",
    "filamentary structure , by itself , poses no particular problem as long as the filament orientations are statistically isotropic . in practice , good evidence for isotropy in projected 2d",
    "is needed , as well as some confirmation that the cloud s line - of - sight depth is comparable to its projected extent . in the field selection , one must also pay attention to the boundary conditions .",
    "in our simulations , these are periodic , so there are no problems arising from edge discontinuities .",
    "fields for analysis should be selected so that no significant edge discontinuities exist , though we are aided in this selection by the @xmath44- ( or @xmath120- ) weighting of the relevant fields so that ( to the extent that any `` cloud '' is truly isolated ) a suitable region may be defined where @xmath169 , @xmath255 , and @xmath167 are sufficiently close to zero that this condition is satisfied .",
    "edge - tapering ( e.g. brunt & mac low 2004 ) or padding ( e.g. brunt 2010 ) may be applied to sufficiently large fields , with negligible quantitative consequences .",
    "ratios from figure  [ fig : finalplot2 ] , plotted against a measure of the column density variability , @xmath259.,width=317 ]      in terms of the reliability of the recovered @xmath224 , of most concern is the relatively high degree of scatter in the compressively - forced fields .",
    "the scatter is mainly a consequence of the high degree of variability in these fields , so that variances are contributed to strongly by a small number of extreme field values , perhaps magnifying any anisotropic effects . to quantify this , in figure  [ fig : rmserror ]",
    "we plot the root mean square uncertainty on the measured @xmath224 ratios against a measure of the column density variability , @xmath259 ( which would be the logarithmic variance , @xmath260 , in the case of a lognormal pdf ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rmserror ] shows that typical errors are at the @xmath253  10% level or better for @xmath261 , but then increase sharply for @xmath262 .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ fig : tfrac ] that the @xmath224 ratio does not allow observational discrimination between solenoidal and compressive forcing , since the @xmath224 ratios appear to converge to @xmath253  3/4 at high mach numbers independent of the nature of the forcing ( it is probably unlikely that these curves cross , though we can not say more at present ) .",
    "however , given that observational estimates of @xmath224 have not yet been made , it would be an interesting and important test to see if this ratio ( @xmath253  0.7 @xmath263 0.1 ) is realised in nature and whether there may be systematic variations in different environments .",
    "note that , though mathematically well - defined , the forcing scheme is somewhat idealised physically  assigning accelerations in fourier space , which generate non - local accelerations in direct space .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath224 ratios seen here may not necessarily be replicated in real molecular clouds , where large - scale driving sources could include supernovae or spiral shocks .",
    "one could also consider the initially point - like energy injections from outflows in localised regions generating different @xmath224 ratios .",
    "it may also be possible that @xmath224 could evolve with time in decaying conditions ( our simulations here are continually driven ) or due to an increasing importance of self - gravity over time .",
    "observational application of this method therefore may be more revealing and interesting than simply confirming the `` default '' @xmath264 ratio seen in the current simulations .",
    "a framework for investigating the respective roles of solenoidal and compressive forcing in determining the normalised density variance has been recently presented by konstandin et al ( 2012b ) , and it would be interesting to compare ( or combine ) that method with ours",
    ".    the inclusion of self - gravity will be particularly interesting .",
    "federrath et al ( 2011 ) have shown that gravitational collapse produces a high fraction of longitudinal modes , which are later converted to solenoidal modes .",
    "it may therefore be possible to search for this signature in molecular clouds , after we have validated the method for the self - gravitating case .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the current work , but we note that the geometrical constraints , that lead to projection of solenoidal modes only , will not be affected by inclusion of self - gravity .",
    "it is true , however , that self - gravity will have a notable effect on the density pdf , and presumably on the degree of density  velocity correlation .",
    "a number of theoretical studies have looked at the generation of @xmath253power  law tails in density pdfs ( e.g. klessen 2000 ; kritsuk , norman , & wagner 2011 ; federrath & klessen 2013 ; girichidis 2014 ) and corresponding features have been seen observationally : early - time pdfs appear @xmath253lognormal in form , while more evolved clouds have more prevalent power ",
    "law tails in their density pdfs ( e.g. kainulainen et al 2009 ; schneider et al 2013 ; schneider et al 2014 ; kainulainen et al 2014 ) .      in the further testing of this model ( in addition to the key question of anisotropy )",
    "there are two main areas that should be investigated .",
    "first , in terms of numerics , we need more information on the role of density - velocity correlations ( section  4 ) by measuring @xmath178 over a greater range of physical conditions , including the effects of self - gravity , as mentioned above , and a more detailed investigation of magnetic fields . in the analysis completed above , we have introduced the concept of @xmath178 and the correction factors @xmath265 and demonstrated their use in practice . admittedly , there was a degree of internal `` tuning '' of @xmath178 employed , though we did support the measured @xmath178 values with independent data , and the correction terms @xmath175 here are close enough to unity to be of not overwhelming concern .",
    "more important , perhaps , is the possible role that the statistical system presented in section  4 may play in other contexts for understanding density - velocity correlations in turbulent media .    the second main avenue for improvement will be in the investigation of more mundane observational considerations , such as excitation and opacity .",
    "the analysis presented above was completed under the assumption of uniform excitation and in the optically - thin limit , and therefore serves as a baseline for quantifying how variable excitation and finite opacity affect the method .",
    "naively , this would make the measurements of @xmath224 less reliable , and possibly biased , but may also have the advantageous affect of taming some of the field variability .",
    "finally , we have based the method around the recovery of the fraction of _ momentum _ power , @xmath266 , in transverse modes simply because the momentum field satisfies the observational requirement that it is projected into 2d unweighted by any other physical fields .",
    "one could also consider the fraction of velocity dispersion , @xmath267 , in transverse modes ( which is sensitive to the forcing mechanism ",
    "federrath et al 2011 ) or indeed the fraction of energy , @xmath268 , in transverse modes  either of which , arguably , more naturally spring to mind as relevant quantities to measure .",
    "the prospects for measuring either of the two above - named alternatives to momentum power are rather dim however , since neither field is accessible as a projected quantity observationally ( except in the case of uniform density when all three definitions are equivalent ) .    in the general case where the density is variable , neither the velocity nor energy can be isolated for independent study .",
    "for example , note that the @xmath45-component of the momentum field , which is projected unweighted into 2d , is the product of the density , @xmath44 , and @xmath45-velocity , @xmath181 .",
    "therefore the crucially - important ( projected ) power spectrum of @xmath255 involves the 3d _ convolution _ of the fourier transforms of @xmath44 and @xmath181 , of which a single plane ( @xmath6 ) is available for analysis . to isolate the velocity contribution",
    ", one could in principle imagine deconvolving the density contribution for a simply - structured density field ( e.g. a 3d gaussian or spatial power - law ) , but for the highly complex and variable density fields encountered in the ism , this appears futile . one possible way to proceed is to form an understanding of the relation between the three quantities ( @xmath267 , @xmath268 , and @xmath266 ) by a means similar to the statistical system presented in the appendix  because the different quantities are just different @xmath269-weighted velocity dispersions .",
    "the stumbling block is simply that the fourier space power distributions may be rather different , so that the deprojection factors become unreliable . in this case , an understanding of any scale - dependency of the statistical relationship between @xmath267 , @xmath268 , and @xmath266 would be required , as well as an understanding of their transverse / longitudinal mode dependence .",
    "these considerations are beyond the scope of the current paper , but may be a worthwile pursuit in future studies .",
    "in this paper we have introduced an observational method for measuring the fraction of momentum power in solenoidal modes in a turbulent cloud , and confirmed its applicability using hydrodynamic numerical simulations .",
    "the method is best - suited to application in nearby molecular clouds for which high sensitivity , high spatial dynamic range spectral line observations are available .",
    "the principal limitation of the method at present is its reliance on the assumption of isotropy .",
    "further work is needed to examine the impact of anisotropy imposed by ( e.g. ) magnetic fields ( bfp ) or anisotropic driving of turbulence ( hansen et al 2011 ) .",
    "isotropy aside , the main limiting factor in the accuracy of the model is variability in the physical fields ( density , momentum ) .",
    "we have also introduced a statistical framework for describing density - velocity correlations in turbulent media that should be of relevance beyond its application here .",

    "for isothermal turbulence , a lognormal pdf for @xmath276 is a reasonable approximation ( vzquez - semadeni 1994 ; padoan , nordlund , & jones 1997 ; federrath et al 2008 ; kainulainen et al 2009 ) , for which : @xmath298 .\\ ] ] the normalisation of the field to @xmath299 requires that @xmath300 , so that @xmath301 = \\langle \\xi^{2 } \\rangle^{\\frac{1}{2}(q^{2 } - q)},\\ ] ] where we have made use of @xmath302 in the last step .",
    "the predicted form for @xmath303 ( in the case of a lognormal density pdf ) agrees well with the moment spectra shown in figure  [ fig : epicplot ] : i.e. @xmath304 is parabolic against @xmath293 , equal to unity at @xmath288 and @xmath305 , and reaches a minimum at @xmath306 .    inserting this result into equation  ( [ eq : sigvxc ] )",
    "then gives : @xmath307 and equation  ( [ eq : sigvxb ] ) becomes : @xmath308 we define velocity dispersion ratios , @xmath265 , as follows : @xmath309 in the next section we will make use of the following ratio : @xmath310 note that if the density field is uniform ( @xmath311 ) then @xmath271 . in general , the assumption @xmath291 requires that there be no statistical correlation between density and velocity . to apply this correction observationally ,",
    "a measurement of @xmath312 is required .",
    "this is can be done , since the 3d normalised density dispersion , @xmath313 , and therefore @xmath314 can be estimated by the bfp method .",
    "the applicability of equation  ( [ eq : sigvxc ] ) to the numerical density and velocity fields can be tested by calculating and comparing @xmath295 and @xmath296 . from the simulated data ,",
    "moments between @xmath288 and @xmath315 in steps of 0.05 were calculated in the zero momentum frame , using the full 3d velocity field .",
    "to ensure that the resulting values of @xmath178 are not simply `` tuned '' to the numerical simulations analysed in this paper , we use a much larger sample of density and velocity fields by including the simulations from bfp .",
    "these include both hydrodynamic simulations ( using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) and mhd simulations ( using grid calculations )  see section  3 and bfp for more details .",
    "we only consider supersonic fields in this analysis , since the influence of density fluctuations in subsonic fields is minimal  we will return to this point at the end of this section .",
    "after calculation of the moments , a 6@xmath316-order polynomial in @xmath293 ( @xmath317 ) was fitted to @xmath304 . following this , the same polynomial with the same ( fixed ) @xmath318",

    "it is clear that the proposed form @xmath327 results in a good representation of the moment spectrum @xmath295 .",
    "it is also apparent from the plots in figure  [ fig : epicplot ] that @xmath178 ( i.e. the horizontal shift of the @xmath328 moment spectrum relative to the @xmath303 moment spectrum ) decreases with increasing rms mach number . to quantify this further , the fitted values of @xmath178 for all hydrodynamic data are shown in figure  [ fig : epichydro ] , plotted versus the measured 3d density - weighted mach number , @xmath329 , where @xmath192 is the sound speed .",
    "a power law relation is seen , represented by the fitted line , which is : @xmath330 where we have used the subscript @xmath331 to denote that the fit was obtained in the hydrodynamic limit where the alfvnic mach number @xmath332 .",
    "the values of @xmath178 obtained from the mhd simulations are shown in figure  [ fig : epicmhd ] , where they are plotted versus @xmath235 .",
    "relative to the hydrodynamic results , represented by the straight line ( @xmath239 ) , the mhd fields tend to give lower values of @xmath178 at the lower mach numbers .",
    "we find that in the low @xmath225 regime , @xmath178 appears to decrease with decreasing alfvnic mach number , @xmath238 , as shown in figure  [ fig : evsma ] , where we have plotted @xmath333 versus @xmath238 .",
    "however , an @xmath238-dependency ( if any ) is less clear at higher @xmath235 . in the analysis below",
    ", we will adopt @xmath239 , obtained in the hydrodynamic limit , as the basis for deriving correction factors ( @xmath175 ) .    for a given @xmath312",
    ", a smaller @xmath178 leads to a correction factor ( @xmath175 ) closer to unity .",
    "in fact , at fixed sonic mach number , numerical simulations suggest that @xmath312 should be closer to unity for strongly magnetized turbulence than for hydrodynamic turbulence ( molina et al 2012 ) . together with lower @xmath178",
    ", this would predict that @xmath175 should be closer to unity for strongly magnetized turbulence than for the hydrodynamic case .",
    "finally , as mentioned previously , we have only considered supersonic fields in the above analysis . since the velocity dispersion ratios ( equation  ( [ eq : vdisprat ] ) ) depend on @xmath303 to the power @xmath334 , fields for which @xmath335 ( i.e. uniform or weakly varying density fields ) require large values of @xmath178 for small corrections .",
    "we find that measurement of @xmath178 in this regime ( by the method given above ) is rather unstable , with @xmath178 increasing strongly , with large scatter , as @xmath336 . in the analysis in section  4",
    ", we will nevertheless investigate values of the correction factor @xmath175 extrapolated into the subsonic regime .      in the preceding analysis",
    ", we made the assumption that the velocity dispersion decreases with the density at which it is measured ( i.e. equations  ( [ vdispeq1 ] )  and  ( [ vdispeq2 ] ) ) , and explored the consequences on velocity dispersions calculated with a @xmath269weight . to do this , priveleged access to the density and velocity fields in 3d is required , so this is not possible to do observationally by exactly the same method .",
    "an alternative means of constraining the effect of such density  velocity correlations is to interpret equations  ( [ vdispeq1 ] )  and  ( [ vdispeq2 ] ) literally and examine velocity dispersions measured observationally in different density regimes .",
    "larson s ( 1981 ) relations between velocity dispersion ( or linewidth ) and cloud size ( @xmath337 ) and between density and cloud size ( @xmath338 ) can provide a very crude measure of @xmath178 in molecular clouds .",
    "combining the two relations gives a measure of @xmath339 , though with some major caveats .",
    "the original @xmath340 and @xmath341 derived by larson ( 1981 ) give @xmath342 , while values of @xmath343 and @xmath344 ( assuming virial equilibrium ) give @xmath345 from solomon et al ( 1987 ) .",
    "scale co surveys use size , linewidth , and mean density measured in distinct clouds rather than probing the density  dependence of velocity dispersion internal to individual clouds . extending such cloud / clump  based analyses to `` sub  cloud '' scales are highly questionable ( e.g. ballesteros  paredes & mac low 2002 ; schneider & brooks 2004 ) , but nevertheless tend to yield values of @xmath346 and @xmath347 roughly in accord with the large  scale values , though in the presence of significant scatter . using the analysis of simon et al ( 2001 ) on 4 inner galaxy clouds ( in solomon et al 1987 s survey region ) , we find values of @xmath178 between 0.17 and 0.39 ( the lower values being mostly due to shallower linewidth  size relations than that found by solomon et al 1987 ) .",
    "criticisms have been levelled at the density  size relation as being a consequence of limited dynamic range in cloud surface density ( e.g. vzquez - semadeni , ballesteros - paredes , & rodriguez 1997 ) . using the solomon et al ( 1987 ) cloud sample , heyer et al ( 2009 )",
    "found that , over the limited surface density range available , velocity dispersions rose with surface density as @xmath348 at fixed cloud size .",
    "if we make the reasonable assumption that higher surface density indicates higher volume density , then @xmath349 should provide an upper limit to @xmath178 .",
    "the @xmath178 values derived here by larson s relations are quoted for reference , and should be compared to the better  motivated ( and notably lower ) values derived below , using density  selective tracers .",
    "a better  motivated idea than using larson s relations is to compare velocity dispersions of trace molecules that are excited in different density regimes in the same cloud .",
    "we expect that high  density tracers should have smaller velocity dispersions than low  density tracers , if their spectral lines are averaged over the same ( large ) volume .",
    "a rough estimate of @xmath178 may be arrived at by assuming that spectral line emission from a given trace molecule is dominated by contributions from material near the molecule s critical density . with this assumption ,",
    "if tracer @xmath320 has critical density @xmath350 and velocity dispersion @xmath351 and tracer @xmath190 has critical density @xmath352 and velocity dispersion @xmath353 , then equations  ( [ vdispeq1 ] )  and  ( [ vdispeq2 ] ) predict that : @xmath354 from this , @xmath178 may be estimated via : @xmath355    in reality , the tracers will sample a range of densities above their effective critical densities .",
    "a better motivation for equations  ( [ obsepsilon ] )  and  ( [ obsepsilon2 ] ) can be arrived at by more carefully considering such a system .",
    "if we restrict the analysis to two tracers whose effective critical densities lie on the positive tail of the density pdf and assume that in this regime , self - gravity will push the pdf into a power  law form ( @xmath279  @xmath356  @xmath357 ) , then we can calculate velocity dispersions via equation  ( [ eq : sigvxa ] ) as : @xmath358 ( and similarly for tracer @xmath190 ) and where we have taken the lower limit of the integral as @xmath359 and assumed that @xmath360 so that the integrals converge .",
    "note that the velocity dispersion is calculated with a @xmath44weight ( @xmath305 ) .",
    "taking the velocity dispersion ratio of the two tracers , we find : @xmath361 which is exactly the same as equation  ( [ obsepsilon ] ) .",
    "if not a power  law pdf , a sufficiently steeply  falling pdf ( lognormal , exponential ) will give similar results , as the dispersions are heavily influenced by densities at the lower threshold ( see e.g. ballesteros  paredes , dalessio , & hartmann 2012 for examination of a mathematically  equivalent system ) .",
    "mcquinn et al ( 2002 ) examined cs ( j=21 ) and @xmath362co ( j=10 ) emission in the inner galaxy observed as part of the galatic ring survey ( jackson et al 2006 ) and found no significant difference between cs ( j=21 ) and @xmath362co ( j=10 ) velocity dispersions , as evidenced by roughly constant brightness temperature ratios for composite spectra averaged over large clouds ( many parsecs scale )",
    ". the critical densities of cs ( j=21 ) and @xmath362co ( j=10 ) are @xmath253  10@xmath363  @xmath364 and @xmath253  5  @xmath365",

    "however , mcquinn et al ( 2002 ) ultimately concluded that subthermal excitation was a probable factor in the line excitation ( especially for cs ) so that the effective critical densities would be lower than nominal .    to examine this more closely",

    "they found small differences in clump internal velocity dispersion in the ( j=32 ) and ( j=10 ) @xmath362co lines : slightly broader 32 lines in the rosette , relative to 10 ( implying @xmath370 in this case , since the critical density of the 32 line is @xmath253  10 times that of the 10 line ) ; slightly narrower lines are found for 32 in g216 , relative to 10 .",

    "can not be maintained over all densities ( over all space ) , though one could potentially imagine high  density clumps moving through a relatively static low density substrate as a possible configuration for this .",
    "the negative value of @xmath178 for the rosette more likely comes instead from ( e.g. ) outflows injecting energy locally in a characteristic density regime near the j=32 critical density .",

    "second , in a turbulent medium , the velocity dispersion increases with spatial scale , and the lower density structures are necessarily more spatially  extended than the higher density structures . for molecules with the same ( nominal ) critical density , the more abundant molecule will have a lower effective critical density , and therefore be more spatially  extended and have a higher velocity dispersion .",
    "( in principle , the first of these two factors may be reversed ( i.e. higher velocity dispersion in denser gas at fixed spatial scale ) and still yield a positive @xmath178 as long as the second factor dominates . )    if a targeted , single ",
    "point measurement is made towards an atypical position ( e.g. a core ) within a larger medium , as was done for some of the observations reported above , this may not provide a reliable measure of the density  dependence of velocity dispersion in the medium as a whole . instead",
    ", if a velocity dispersion measurement is made using a high  density tracer averaged over sufficiently large scales , then it will sample many density enhancements that are spatially distributed , and therefore result in a larger overall velocity dispersion ( more comparable to the extended medium seen by a lower  density tracer ) .",
    "though the @xmath362co ( j=32 ) and ( j=10 ) results above raise some questions , the observationally  estimated values of @xmath178 over large critical density baselines are in reasonable accord with those found in our numerical simulations .",
