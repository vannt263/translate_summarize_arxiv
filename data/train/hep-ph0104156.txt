    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , there arise many new cp violating ( cpv ) phases beyond the km phase in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "these susy cpv phases generically lead to too large electron / neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) and @xmath2 .",
    "there are basically three different ways to evade this susy cp problem : @xcite ( i ) vanishing ( or very small ) susy cp phases , ( ii ) decoupling scenario ( effective or more minimal mssm @xmath3 mmssm ) , and ( iii ) cancellation mechanism.@xcite in each case , these new susy cp phases could affect @xmath0 and @xmath1 physics in vastly different manners .",
    "in this talk , we report our three recent works related with this subject.@xcite the topics covered here are divided into two parts . in the first part , we consider a possibility of observing effects of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 phases which are flavor conserving at @xmath0 factories in the mmssm ( including the electroweak baryogenesis scenario therein @xcite ) . in the second part of the talk ,",
    "i demonstrate that fully supersymmetric cp violations in the kaon system are possible , on the contrary to the conventional folklore .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath6 can be accounted for in terms of a _ single _ cp violating complex number @xmath7 ( to be defined below ) within the double mass insertion approximation ( mia ) .",
    "in the mmssm ( decoupling sceario ) , the 1st and the 2nd family squarks are assumed to be very heavy and almost degenerate in order to solve the susy",
    "fcnc / cp problems.@xcite only the third family squarks can be light enough to affect @xmath8 and @xmath9 mixing .",
    "we also ignore possible flavor changing squark mass matrix elements that could generate gluino - mediated flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process in addition to those effects we consider below .",
    "recently , such effects were studied in the @xmath9 mixing,@xcite the branching ratio of @xmath8 @xcite and cp violations therein,@xcite and @xmath10,@xcite respectively . ignoring such contributions ,",
    "the only source of the fcnc in our model is the ckm matrix , whereas there are new cpv phases coming from the phases of @xmath4 and @xmath5 parameters in the flavor preserving sector in addition to the km phase @xmath11 in the flavor changing sector .",
    "( we choose to work in the basis where the wino mass parameter @xmath12 is real . ) in this sense , this paper is complementary to the ealier works.@xcite    even if the 1st/2nd generation squarks are very heavy and degenerate , there is another important edm constraints considered by chang , keung and pilaftsis ( ckp ) for large @xmath13.@xcite this constraint comes from the two loop diagrams involving stop / sbottom loops , and is independent of the masses of the 1st/2nd generation squarks . therefore , this ckp edm constraints can not be simply evaded by making the 1st/2nd generation squarks very heavy , and it turns out that this puts a very strong constraint on the possible new phase shift in the @xmath9 mixing",
    ".    the @xmath9 mixing is generated by the box diagrams with @xmath14 and @xmath15 running around the loops in addition to the sm contribution.@xcite the gluino and neutralino contributions are negligible in our model .",
    "it turns out that the chargino exchange contributions to @xmath9 mixing can be generically complex relative to the sm contributions , and can generate a new phase shift in the @xmath9 mixing relative to the sm value .",
    "this effect can be in fact significant for large @xmath16 , since the chargino contribution is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite however , the ckp edm constraint puts a strong constraint for large @xmath13 case . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , we plot @xmath18 as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the open squares ( the crosses ) denote those which ( do not ) satisfy the ckp edm constraints .",
    "it is clear that the ckp edm constraint on @xmath19 is in fact very important for large @xmath13 , and we have @xmath20 .",
    "this observation is important for the ckm phenomenology , since time - dependent cp asymmetries in neutral @xmath0 decays into @xmath21 etc .",
    "would still measure directly three angles of the unitarity triangle even in the presence of new cp violating phases , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the above @xmath9 mixing is also related with the dilepton asymmetry which is proportional to @xmath24 . neglecting the small sm contribution which is about @xmath25 , we found that @xmath26 in our mode , which is well below the current data , @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , if any appreciable amount of the dilepton asymmetry is observed , it would indicate some new cpv phases in the off - diagonal down - squark mass matrix elements,@xcite assuming the mssm is realized in nature .",
    "= 10.3 cm    unlike the @xmath28 and @xmath29 discussed in the previous paragraphs , the magnitude of @xmath30 can be affected a lot by the @xmath4 and @xmath5 phases , and it will affect the determination of @xmath31 from @xmath32 . the deviation from the sm can be as large as @xmath33,@xcite and the correlation behaves differently from the minimal supergravity case.@xcite    the radiative decay of @xmath0 mesons , @xmath8 , is described by the effective hamiltonian including ( chromo)magnetic dipole operators .",
    "interference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( where the strong phase is generated by the charm loop via @xmath36 vertex ) can induce direct cp violation in @xmath8.@xcite in our model , @xmath37 can be as large as @xmath38 if chargino is light enough , even if we impose all the relevant edm constraints @xcite ( see fig .  1 ( b ) ) .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 phases can also affect @xmath10 , whose branching ratio can be enhanced upto @xmath39 compared to the sm prediction in our model,@xcite and the correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath41 is distinctly different from the minimal supergravity scenario ( cmssm ) ( even with new cp violating phases ) @xcite in the presence of new cp violating phases in @xmath42 as demonstared in model - independent analysis by kim , ko and",
    "lee.@xcite it is crucial to consider the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath8 in the model independent determination of @xmath43 , since these wilson coefficients may be complex in general .",
    "one can also consider the @xmath44 mixing in this model , and we find @xmath45 can be as large as 1.4 for @xmath46.@xcite this is a factor 2 larger deviation from the sm compared to the minimal supergravity case.@xcite the dependence on the lighter stop is close to the case of the minimal supergravity case , but we can have a larger deviations .",
    "such deviation is reasonably close to the experimental value , and will affect the ckm phenomenology at a certain level .",
    "this is the extent to which the new phases in @xmath4 and @xmath5 can affect the construction of the unitarity triangle through @xmath2 .",
    "in the mssm with many new cpv phases , there is an intriguing possibility that the observed cp violation in @xmath47 is fully supersymmetric due to the complex parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the soft susy breaking terms which also break cp softly , or cp violating @xmath48 .",
    "our study indicates that the supersymmetric @xmath2 ( namely , for @xmath49 ) is less than @xmath50 , which is too small compared to the observed value : @xmath51 .",
    "details for this discussions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although one can not generate enough cp violations in the kaon system through flavor preserving @xmath4 and @xmath5 phases in the mssm , it is possible if one considers the flavor changing susy cpv phases .",
    "let us work in the mass insertion approximation ( mia ) and consider the flavor changing @xmath52 in order to study these pheomena in a model independent manner .",
    "the folklore was that if one saturates the @xmath2 with @xmath53 , the corresponding @xmath54 is far less than the observed value . on the other hand ,",
    "if one saturates @xmath54 with @xmath55 , the resulting @xmath2 is again too small compared to the data .",
    "therefore one would need both @xmath56 phase .",
    "masiero and murayama argued that such a large value of @xmath57 is not implausible in general mssm , e.g. , if the fundamental theory is a string theory.@xcite in their model , the large @xmath55 is intimately related with the large @xmath58 , so that their prediction on the neutron edm is very close to the current experimental limit .",
    "subsequently , we pointed out that a single complex number @xmath59 with an order @xmath60 phase in fact can generate both @xmath2 and @xmath54 , if one goes beyond the single mass insertion approximation as often done in this field.@xcite in our model , @xmath2 is generated by @xmath53 , whereas @xmath54 is generated by a flavor preserving @xmath61 transition followed by flavor changing @xmath62 transition .",
    "( 500,130 )    the former is proportinal to @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the common squark mass in the mia .",
    "this kind of the induced @xmath65 mixing is always present generically in any susy models .",
    "if the km phase were not zero , the ckmology should differ significantly from the sm case .",
    "for example , we can not use the constraints coming from @xmath2 or @xmath66 , since new physics would contribute to both @xmath67 and @xmath68 amplitudes .",
    "more detailed discussions on these points will be presented elsewhere.@xcite finally let us note that the recent observation on cp asymmetry in @xmath69 depends on different cp violating parameter @xmath70 where @xmath71 or @xmath72 , and @xmath73 or @xmath74 , and is independent of the kaon sector we considered here in the mass insertion approximation .",
    "( 700,230 )    = 8.3 cm",
    "in conclusion , we first discussed the effects of @xmath5 and @xmath4 phases in the mmssm on several observables in the @xmath0 meson system and on @xmath2 .",
    "our study includes the ew baryogenesis scenario in the mssm .",
    "we demonstrated that the susy cp violating phases in @xmath4 and @xmath5 can affect the @xmath0 and @xmath1 physics a lot ( especially direct cp asymmetry in @xmath8 ) , even if they are flavor conserving .",
    "we also argued that if we consider susy phases with flavor violation such as a flavor changing squark mixing @xmath7 , fully supersymmetric cp violation is possible for relatively large @xmath13 ( more specifically , @xmath75 tev ) in the double mass insertion approximation .",
    "the ongoing @xmath0 and @xmath1 factory experiements will test the km paradigm for cp violation , and will shed light on the possible new sources of cp violations ( which is necessary in the electroweak baryogenesis scenario ) , especially if the mssm is the correct effective theory for nature at the electroweak scale .",
