    "experiments based on liquid xenon are leading the search of neutrinoless double beta decay of @xmath0xe due to the fast development of this detection technique in the last decade  @xcite .",
    "more recently , experiments based on high pressure xenon time projection chambers ( hpxe - tpcs )  @xcite have been proposed due to their better intrinsic energy resolution ( @xmath21%  fwhm ) and the access to topological features , which may provide extra discrimination from background events , keeping good signal efficiency . in this context , the use of micromegas charge readout planes  @xcite in a hpxe - tpc has been studied by t - rex project , leading to the following results : micromegas readouts show extremely low levels of radioactivity ( below 0.1  @xmath3bq/@xmath4 for both @xmath5bi and @xmath6tl )  @xcite ; they have been operated in xenon - trimethylamine ( xe - tma ) at 10 bar in realistic experimental conditions ( 30  cm diameter readout , 1200  channels , 38  cm drift ) , proving an energy resolution of 3%  fwhm at the range of interest ( roi )  @xcite ; and the combination of high granularity readout planes and low diffusion ( as measured in xe - tma ) can reduce the background level by two - three orders of magnitude keeping a signal efficiency of 40%  @xcite .",
    "micromegas readout planes will be used in the first module of pandax - iii experiment  @xcite , to be installed at the china jinping underground laboratory ( cjpl )  @xcite by 2017 .",
    "a half - life sensitivity of @xmath7  y ( at 90% cl ) is expected after 3 years of live - time , supposing a  3%  fwhm energy resolution at q - value ( 2458 kev ) , a background level of @xmath8 counts kev@xmath9kg@xmath9y@xmath9 at the roi and a signal efficiency of  35% .",
    "the potential of discrimination methods in this detection technique , which combines a low diffusion gas like xe - tma and readout planes with pixel sizes of @xmath21  mm , is the aim of this paper and will be further developed in a future publication .",
    "a 200  kg hpxetpc filled with xe+1%tma at 10 bar has been simulated by geant4 and rest codes  @xcite , fixing a pixel size of 2  mm and an energy resolution of 1%  fwhm at the roi . in the analysis , tracks and blobs",
    "are found by two well - known algorithms of graph theory : the identification of connections ( or tracks ) and the search for the longest path .",
    "signal events are then selected by three discrimination criteria : a fiducial area ; a single - track condition , with some possible bremsstrahlung photons ( energy below 40  kev ) situated near the main track ( 12  cm maximum ) ; and some limits in the blob charge and density .",
    "the distribution of these two last observables are shown in in fig .  [",
    "fig : toprejection ] to illustrate their discrimination power .",
    "the little blob charge distribution ( black line ) is quite separated from background distributions , as already shown by the gotthard experiment  @xcite .",

    "the background level of these components in the roi is reduced by two and three orders of magnitude respectively , down to @xmath10 and @xmath11 counts kev@xmath9kg@xmath9y@xmath9 .",
    "the blob criteria reject a factor @xmath12 of background events for the vessel , a value better than gotthard experiment  @xcite , and a factor @xmath13 for the readouts .",
    "the absence of a trigger signal ( or @xmath1 ) by registering the primary scintillation only gives a factor @xmath14 more background events in the roi : this indicates that the implementation of a @xmath1 -unwanted due to the technological and radiopurity cost of a light readout- is not imperative .",

    "these motivating results can not be directly translated to a background model of a hpxetpc because the electronics and the readout planes must be included in the simulation , as done in  @xcite .",

    "this second option has been extensively studied by liquid argon detectors , like icarus  @xcite and dune  @xcite . however , its application to @xmath16 is a challenging task as mev electron tracks are relatively short compared to their complex topology and there are only two 2d views for each event .",
