    "charge balance function ( bf ) has been widely used as an effective exploring for the hadronization scheme in hadron - hadron collisions at the isr energies  @xcite and @xmath0 annihilations at petra energies  @xcite .",
    "recently , the charge bf gains special attentions in clocking hadronization at relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "a narrowing of the bf is suggested as a signature for delayed hadronization  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the bf on centrality and system size has been reported by several relativistic heavy - ion experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , most of the current heavy - ion experiments are limited by the pseudorapidity range  @xcite , it is impossible to quantitatively compare the results from the experiments with the coverage at different pseudorapidity ranges .",
    "the dependence of the bf on the pseudorapidity window is essential for understanding the physics of the bf  @xcite , and has been carefully studied by na22  @xcite and star experiments for hadron - hadron and relativistic heavy ion collisions , respectively .",
    "the na22 experiment has full 4@xmath1 acceptance and excellent momentum resolution  @xcite .",
    "it is found in the experiment that the bf in @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions at 22 gev is invariant under longitudinal boost over the whole rapidity range of produced particles , in spite of the non - boost - invariance of the single - particle density .",
    "moreover , the bf of the whole rapidity range can be deduced from the bf properly scaled by the width of rapidity windows  @xcite .",
    "the star experiment covers a finite but relative wide pseudorapidity range .",
    "the scaling property of the bf in au + au collisions at 200 gev is further observed in the experiment  @xcite .",
    "this scaling property of the balance function is also found in different @xmath4 ranges of final state particles .",
    "these results from both hadron - hadron and nuclear collisions indicate that charge balance of produced particles in strong interactions is boost - invariance in longitudinal phase - space , in contrary with the single particle density .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see if those properties are taken into account in the models which are successfully described hadron - hadron and nuclear collisions , and how they associate with the mechanisms of particle production in the models .",
    "charge balance function measures how the conserved electric charge compensate in the phase space , i.e. , how the surrounding net charge are rearranged if the charge of a selected point changes@xcite . in high energy collisions ,",
    "the production of charged particles are constrained by charge balance in the phase space .",
    "the bf therefore provides a direct access to collision dynamics .",
    "the bf has been originally defined in terms of a combination of four kinds of charge - related conditional densities in pseudorapidity  @xcite @xmath5 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath6 represents the ratio @xmath7 with @xmath8 standing for @xmath9 or @xmath10 charged particles .",
    "projecting to pseudorapidity difference @xmath11 in an pseudorapidity window @xmath12 , it becomes  @xcite @xmath13\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the total number of pairs of opposite charged particles with pseudorapidity difference @xmath15 in the pseudorapidity window @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the number of positively and negatively charged particles in the window @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is the average over the whole event sample .    from the findings of the bf at na22  @xcite and star experiments  @xcite , the bf is boost - invariant in the whole rapidity range in hadron - hadron collisions and may be in nuclear collisions as well . in the case ,",
    "the properly scaled bf is corresponding to the bf of the whole pseudorapidity range and is deduced by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the width of pseudorapidity window .",
    "the pythia 5.720  @xcite is well set up for _ p_+_p _ collisions .",
    "it is a standard monte carlo generator with string fragmentation as hadronization scheme .",
    "two versions of a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model  @xcite are used to study au+au collisions .",
    "one is the ampt default and the other one is the ampt with string melting . in both versions ,",
    "the initial conditions are obtained from the hijing model , and then the scattering among partons are given by zpc . in the ampt default model , the partons recombined with their parent strings when they stop interacting , and",
    "the resulting strings are converted to hadrons using the lund string fragmentation model , while in the ampt model with string melting , quark coalescence is used in combining partons into hadrons .",
    "the dynamics of the hadronic matter is described by art model .",
    "it is commonly believed that in relativistic heavy ion collisions , the charge ordering during the string fragmentation in elementary collisions is no longer valid , and it should be replaced by the quark - coalescence mechanism in hadronization  @xcite .",
    "so it is interesting to see whether the boost - invariance of the bf is sensitive to the mechanisms of hadronization .    in this paper",
    ", we firstly study the boost - invariance of the bf for _",
    "p_+_p _ collisions at @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 gev using the pythia , and for au+au collisions at @xmath23 gev using two versions of the ampt . the transverse momentum dependence of longitudinal scaling property of the bf is then examined in the models .",
    "the obtained results are compared with corresponding experimental data and discussed .",

    "the solid down triangle is the bf of the whole @xmath29 range . ]    in order to demonstrate directly whether the bf is invariant under a longitudinal lorentz transformation over the whole rapidity in hadron - hadron collisions , we choose four equal size ( @xmath30 ) pseudorapidity windows locating at different positions ( @xmath31 ) , ( @xmath32 ) , ( @xmath33 ) and ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the results for _ p_+_p _ collisions at @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 gev are shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "the statistic errors are smaller than the markers .",
    "it is clear that the bf measured in four windows are approximately identical to each other at two incident energies .",
    "this indicates that the charge compensation is essentially the same in any longitudinally - lorentz - transformed frame for _",
    "p_+_p _ collisions in the pythia model , consistent with the data from na22 experiment .",
    "these results show that the string fragmentation mechanism implemented in pythia well describes the production mechanisms of charge particles and their charge balance in longitudinal phase space .",
    "1(c ) and ( d ) are the scaled balance function @xmath28 at two incident energies .",
    "they are deduced from directly measured @xmath24 at six different pseudorapidity windows , ( @xmath35 ) ( open circles ) , ( @xmath36 ) ( open triangles ) , ( @xmath37 ) ( open squares ) , ( @xmath38 ) ( open diamonds ) , ( @xmath34 ) ( open crosses ) , and ( @xmath39 ) ( open stars ) . from the figures we can see that all the @xmath28 deduced from different windows are coincide with each other within errors , as expected from boost - invariance of the bf  @xcite .",
    "the solid down triangles in the same figures are the bf of the whole pseudorapidity range , @xmath40 .",
    "it is close to the scaled balance function @xmath28 .",
    "these results indicate that the scaled bf is in fact corresponding to the bf of the whole pseudorapidity range @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "upper panel : the @xmath24 in five pseudorapidity windows with equal size @xmath42 at the different positions for au+au collisions at @xmath27 gev by ( a ) the ampt default and ( b ) the ampt with string melting .",

    "it is then interesting to see whether the boost - invariance of the bf is held in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "star experiment only observe the boost - invariance of bf in cental pseudorapidity range @xmath43  @xcite , where the single particle distribution is almost flat , or boost - invariance . now in model investigation , we can carefully examine the property in the whole pseudorapidity range .    the upper panel of fig .",
    "2 is the bf in five pseudorapidity windows with equal size @xmath44 at different positions ( @xmath45 ) , ( @xmath46 ) , ( @xmath47 ) , ( @xmath48 ) and ( @xmath36 )",
    ". where the fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) are the results from the ampt default ( v1.11 ) and the ampt with string melting ( v2.11 ) , respectively .",
    "both figures show that the bf is boost - invariance in pseudorapidity range ( -3 , 3 ) in two versions of the ampt .    the lower panel of fig .  2 is the scaled balance functions , which are obtained from directly measured bf at six different windows as indicated at legend of the figure , where the solid down triangles are the bf in pseudorapidity range ( -4 , 4 ) .",
    "it shows that the scaled bf does not depend on the size and position of the windows , and corresponds to the bf of the whole pseudorapidity in two versions of the ampt , consistent with the results of _",
    "p_+_p _ collisions in the pythia model .",
    "the longitudinal property of boost invariance of bf comes from the special longitudinal interaction of charged particles under the constraint of global electric charge balance .",
    "global electric charge conservation not only applies to all final - state charged particles , but also constrains particles which are produced at the same proper time of evolution .",
    "it is argued that the transverse - momentum of final - state particles may be roughly used as a scale of the proper time of their production in the expansion of nuclear collisions  @xcite .",
    "examining the @xmath49 dependence of longitudinal property of the bf will provide direct access on whether particles in specified @xmath49 range are consistent to be produced simultaneously with well balanced electric charge .",
    "so we turn to check whether the boost - invariant of bf holds for particles in different @xmath4 ranges .",
    "3 shows the bf for _",
    "p_+_p _ collisions at @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 gev from pythia in three transverse momentum bins ( @xmath50 ) , ( @xmath51 ) , and ( @xmath52 ) gev/@xmath53 , respectively .",
    "these @xmath4 bins are selected to make the multiplicity in each bin comparable .",
    "the result shows that the points at a given @xmath54 in a restricted @xmath49 interval are approximately coincide with each other , i.e. , the boost - invariance of the bf hold in small @xmath55 ranges .",
    "it indicates that particles produced at different @xmath4 ranges are also boost - invariant for hadron - hadron collisions in the pythia model .            the same study for au+au 200 gev collisions from the two versions of the ampt are presented in the upper and lower panels of fig .  4 , respectively",
    "where four @xmath4 bins are , ( @xmath56 ) , ( @xmath57 ) , ( @xmath58 ) and ( @xmath59 ) gev/@xmath53 . from the upper panel of the figure",
    ", we can see that the bf of different pseudorapidity windows in each @xmath4 bin are close to each other , in consistent with the data from star experiment  @xcite . however , in the ampt with string melting , as shown in the lower panel of the figure , where the bf of different pseudorapidity windows are not as close to each other as those in the upper panel .",
    "this is because in the ampt with string melting , each parton in the evolution of nuclear collision has its own freeze - out time , which last a very long period after the interaction of two nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the particles in the same transverse - momentum range are not freezed - out simultaneously with well balanced charge , and therefore the longitudinal boost - invariance of the bf in small @xmath4 ranges is violated . in the ampt default , the partons recombined with their parent strings immediately after they stop interacting , and converted to hadrons .",
    "so the charge balance of the produced particles in the same @xmath4 ranges is preserved and boost - invariance of the bf keeps .",
    "in the paper , we systematically study the longitudinal boost - invariance of charge balance function and its @xmath49 dependence for _ p_+_p _ and au+au collisions using pythia the ampt models .",
    "it shows that charge balance function is boost - invariance in both hadron - hadron and nuclear interactions , in contrary to the single particle density . as expected , this boost - invariance of the bf make the bf properly scaled by window size is independent of window and corresponds to the bf of the whole ( pseudo)rapidity range .",
    "therefore , the bf is a good measure free from the restriction of finite longitudinal acceptance .",
    "it is further show that the boost invariance of the bf in specified @xmath49 range is valid in pythia for hadron - hadron collisions and the ampt default for au+au collisions . while the ampt with string melting fails to reproduce this property due to the different schemes at hadronization .",
    "so the @xmath4 dependence of the longitudinal property of the bf may be served as a sensitive probe for charge balance in hadronization mechanism .",
