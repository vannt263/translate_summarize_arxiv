    "non - perturbatively the in - medium modification of inter - quark forces , e.g. screening of fundamental charges at finite temperature , is usually studied in terms of the free energy of static ( anti)quarks @xcite .",
    "more precisely one calculates the difference in the free energy of the system with static quarks and the same system without quarks at fixed temperature . the free energy of static quark anti - quark for different color channels ( singlet , octet and averaged ) has been studied in great detail in quenched qcd ( pure su(3 ) gauge theory ) @xcite as well as in su(2 ) gauge theory @xcite .",
    "in the case of full qcd only the color averaged free energy was extensively studied ; the first results for singlet and octet free energy for two flavor qcd have appeared only very recently @xcite . in this paper",

    "the study of the static free energy is interesting as it can be used to define the renormalized polyakov loop .",
    "although the polyakov loop is not an order parameter in the presence of dynamical quarks it shows rapid variation in the transition region and therefore is widely used to describe the transition ( crossover ) in full qcd . in particular",
    ", they are useful for constructing effective mean - field theories @xcite and studying the interplay between the chiral and deconfining aspects of the transition @xcite .",
    "we will study the temperature dependence of the renormalized polyakov loop which shares most of the properties of the usual polyakov loop but has a meaningful continuum limit .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the lattice setup , parameters of simulations and the zero temperature potential which turns out to be crucial for the analysis of the finite temperature free energies presented in section iii .",
    "conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "in this section we are going to describe the lattice parameters for which our analysis have been performed . in our study",
    "we use staggered fermions with asqtad action @xcite .",
    "our analysis to a large extent is based on the gauge configurations generated by the milc collaboration using the asqtad action .",
    "therefore we adopt their strategy for fixing the parameters which is described in refs .",

    "we use the most recent value of @xmath5 extrapolated to continuum and to the physical value of the light quark masses @xmath7 fm @xcite to convert the lattice units to physical units . in table [ par_tab ]",
    "we summarize the lattices , quark masses and the corresponding temperature range used in our analysis .",
    "the free energy of a static quark anti - quark pair contains a lattice spacing dependent divergent piece and thus needs to be renormalized .",
    "this can be done by normalizing it to the zero temperature potential at short distances where the temperature dependence of the free energy can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the static quark potential has been studied by the milc collaboration at three different lattice spacings and various quark masses @xcite .",
    "the zero temperature potential is also defined only up to some constant which needs to be fixed . as temperature",
    "is varied by varying the lattice spacing we need to specify the form of the zero temperature potential which is valid for the whole range of lattice spacing relevant in this study , i.e. @xmath8 .",

    "[ ztp_fig ] we show this parametrization of the potential against lattice data at three different lattice spacing , and different quark masses .",
    "although in the present paper we discuss the case of three degenerate flavors , we show the zero temperature potential also for @xmath10 flavor case as here more detailed data are available . because of the very weak quark mass dependence the case of @xmath10 flavors can be used as a good reference .",

    "we use the coulomb gauge as for this gauge a transfer matrix can be constructed and in the zero temperature limit the usual static potential will be recovered .",
    "alternatively one can replace the wilson line @xmath22 by a dressed gauge invariant wilson line @xmath25 using the eigenvectors of covariant spatial laplacian @xcite .",
    "the dressed wilson line , however , is a non - local operator .",
    "both definitions turned out to equivalent @xcite ( at least numerically ) .",
    "one can also consider the color averaged free energy defined as @xmath26 which can be written as a thermal average of the singlet and octet free energies @xmath27 this quantity is expressed in terms of local explicitly gauge invariant operators and for this reason was extensively studied in the past also in full qcd @xcite .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath28 needs to be fixed using some physical normalization condition .",
    "as we expect that at very short distances the free energy of static quark anti - quark pair is only given by their interaction energy in the vacuum we fix @xmath28 by requiring that the singlet free energy coincides with the zero temperature potential given by eq .",
    "( [ pot_ansatz ] ) .",
    "we start the discussion of our numerical results with the case of the quark of mass @xmath29 on the @xmath30 lattice .",
    "the corresponding numerical results for the singlet and octet free energy are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_f04ms_124 ] .",
    "the singlet free energy approaches a finite value at large distances which is usually interpreted as string breaking at low temperature and screening at high ones .",
    "note that the distance where the free energy effectively flattens is temperature dependent ; it becomes smaller at higher temperatures . at small distances",
    "the singlet free energy is temperature independent and coincides with the zero temperature potential .",
    "this is intuitively expected as at small distances medium effects are not important . similar observation has been made for quenched qcd @xcite .",
    "the octet free energy shows much stronger temperature dependence . at short distances",
    "it is expected to have a repulsive tail , which is clearly visible at high temperatures . at low temperatures",
    "the presence of such a repulsive tail is less obvious .",
    "the reason for this is the following . at low temperatures",
    "no data is available at really short distances ( @xmath31 ) and the ( large distance ) asymptotic value of the octet free energy is large compared to the value of the repulsive tail ( which naively is @xmath32 ) . also the statistical accuracy is lowest at low temperatures .",
    "as the temperature increases both the value of the free energy at large distances is smaller and the statistical accuracy is higher ; in addition more data at shorter distances become accessible .",

    "as one can see , there is no sizeable lattice spacing dependence even at the lowest temperatures where the lattice spacing is the largest .",

    "we also investigate the temperature dependence of the color averaged free energy . in general",
    "due to the presence of color octet contribution the temperature dependence of the color averaged free energy is stronger than that of the singlet free energy @xcite . at small distances , however , it is expected to be dominated by color singlet contribution and the approximate relation @xmath36 should hold @xcite . therefore in fig .",

    "nevertheless , both the chiral condensate and the unrenormalized polyakov loop show a rapid change at approximately the same temperature @xcite referred to as the transition temperature @xmath52 . therefore we can define the transition temperature as the temperature where @xmath53 has a maximum , or equivalently @xmath54 has a minimum .",
    "we have determined @xmath52 in this way and have found it to be consistent with the value of @xmath52 defined from the peak of the chiral susceptibility @xcite . in the following discussion we will find instructive to plot different quantities as function of @xmath55 , especially when comparing with calculations done in su(3 ) gauge theory .    to characterize the range of interaction in the medium it is convenient to introduce the effective screening radius @xmath56 .",

    "now we are going to investigate the temperature and quark mass dependence of the asymptotic value of the free energy and identify the entropy contribution to it .",
