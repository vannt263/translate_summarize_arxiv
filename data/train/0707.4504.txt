    "when studying the physics of systems from the natural world , it is not surprising that one finds many problems which lie outside the realm of equilibrium physics .",
    "rather , we are more likely to find systems which reach some sort of nonequilibrium steady state , characterised by non zero energy flow or other currents . for studying such systems ,",
    "a vibrant collection of models has emerged .",
    "many of the models have been studied extensively , not only for their applications but also for their intrinsically interesting behaviour @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is a paradigmatic model for simple nonequilibrium driven diffusive systems @xcite .",
    "it comprises a one dimensional lattice along which hard - core particles hop , with some bias in direction . despite its simplicity , this model is capable of showing a range of interesting phenomena including boundary induced phase transitions , shock formation and spontaneous symmetry breaking . over the years",
    "the application of the asep has been wide and varied , but it particularly lends itself to the modelling of transport problems @xcite , for example the motion of molecular motors along microtubule filaments in biophysical systems @xcite . indeed the asep was originally introduced as a lattice model of ribosome motion along mrna @xcite .",
    "recently , a particular case of the asep ; the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) , was generalised to incorporate a dynamically extending lattice @xcite .",
    "the new variation allows a particle reaching the end of a lattice to extend it by converting into a single new site . in this way",
    ", a connection is made between the microscopic constituents of the model and the dynamics of the system size .",
    "we also note that very recently an asymmetric exclusion process with langmuir kinetics and a dynamic boundary has also been studied @xcite .",
    "the model of @xcite was motivated by a problem in mycology : the process of filamentous fungal growth , where continuous growth of the filament tip is maintained by a supply of mass transported from behind the tip to the site of growth . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that one could model the transport of vesicles by molecular motors along the network of microtubule fragments by an ensemble of continuous effective microtubules acting as dynamically extending asymmetric exclusion processes .",
    "preliminary mean - field and simulation results showed that various growth regimes occurred , in particular regimes exhibiting a high density of motors near the tip .    in this work ,",
    "the extending tasep of @xcite is discussed in its own right , as a nontrivial addition to the existing class of exclusion process models .",
    "we discuss how steady states may arise in this growing system , and extend the well established tasep phase diagram into a 3-dimensional parameter space . as with the tasep",
    ", we may derive the phase diagram through a phenomenological approach which considers the dynamics of a _ shock _ that travels between the boundaries of the lattice . through this approach ,",
    "we arrive at a new subregion in the phase diagram in which a shock is moving away from both boundaries and thus persists in the system .",
    "we develop a series of mean - field approximations for our analysis . the simplest scheme , which for the asep actually predicts the correct phase diagram @xcite , only predicts the phases qualitatively . however a refined mean - field approximation predicts phase boundaries which are rather close to those we determine by monte carlo simulations . a heuristic argument which considers the symmetry between particles entering one end of the lattice and ` holes ' entering the opposite end provides a further prediction for the phase diagram which is very close indeed to that predicted by the refined mean - field theory .",
    "we find that this prediction is in fact the best fit to the simulation data .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : tasep ] , we review the tasep and introduce the dynamically extending model . in section [ sec : deep ] the model is formally defined and in section [ sec : mf ] a simple mean - field approximation is used to analytically approximate the steady states . in section [ sec : impmf ] the mean - field approximation is extended to include correlations between sites 1 and 2 , resulting in a refined prediction of the model s phase boundaries . in section [ sec :",
    "heur ] , we discuss the heuristic argument and the resulting phase diagram which appears to be in closest agreement with simulation .",
    "the monte carlo simulation results are discussed in section [ sec : pd ] , where phase diagrams for the model are also presented .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] .",

    "we begin by reviewing the well - known tasep , upon which the dynamically extending exclusion process we study is based .",
    "it comprises particles that hop along a one - dimensional lattice in a single direction .",
    "no more than one particle may occupy each lattice site at any given time .",
    "particles are injected at one end of the lattice and removed from the other end with rates @xmath0 and @xmath2 , which are the only control parameters for the model . in the bulk of the lattice",
    ", the hops occur with rate 1 .",
    "figure  [ tasep ] illustrates the tasep schematically .",
    "the behaviour of this system is categorised in terms of its _ steady state phases_. a steady state is reached when the density of each site , that is the time - averaged occupancy , no longer changes with time .",
    "equivalently , when the system is in a steady state , the current of particles along the lattice is the same everywhere .",
    "the phases are defined by the system s macroscopic properties in the large system limit i.e. the particle density _ profile _ across the lattice and the particle current between any two neighbouring lattice sites .",
    "phase transitions are induced by varying the boundary conditions , controlled by parameters @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the exact phase behaviour of the tasep is well understood from the exact solution @xcite as well as mean - field @xcite and other approaches @xcite .",
    "three distinct steady state phases exist . for low input , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ,",
    "the system is in a low density phase , where the bulk of the lattice is at a low density equal to @xmath0 and the current is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "when at @xmath11 , there is a discontinuous phase transition and the system enters a high density phase , now limited by a low output rate @xmath3 .",
    "the bulk of the lattice in this phase is at a high density equal to @xmath12 and the current is equal to @xmath13 . when @xmath0 and @xmath2 are both @xmath14 , the system enters a phase of maximal current .",
    "the system is no longer controlled by the input and output rates , instead the bulk density is @xmath15 and the current is @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the density profile decays algebraically from the boundaries towards the bulk value @xmath15 .",
    "the results are summarised in the phase diagram of figure  [ taseppd ] .",
    "the model discussed in the following work has an additional third parameter , @xmath7 , which is the rate at which a particle reaching the ultimate lattice site may convert into a new lattice site , thus extending the length of the lattice by 1 .",
    "we shall explore the resultant phase structure in the three dimensional parameter space of @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamically extending exclusion process ( deep ) is defined by the rates at which the following processes occur : particles in the bulk hop to the left with rate 1 ; particles enter the lattice from the right with rate @xmath0 ; at site 1 two processes may occur , particles detach from site @xmath17 with rate @xmath2 and particles may transform into a new lattice site with rate @xmath7 .",
    "these processes are illustrated schematically in figure  [ model ] .",
    "thus @xmath7 is the parameter controlling the lattice growth , @xmath2 allows particles to leave the end of the lattice without extending it and ratio @xmath18 controls the efficiency with which the lattice extends .    indicating the presence of a particle by 1 and an empty lattice site by 0 the stochastic dynamics is @xmath19",
    "note the direction of particle hopping is to the _ left _ ( as opposed to most studies of the tasep where the direction is to the right ) for reasons which will soon become apparent .",
    "this choice is of course immaterial .    also note that under the simultaneous reversal of the direction of particle hopping and interchange of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , the tasep enjoys an exact particle - hole symmetry at the microscopic level , while the deep does not",
    "this is due to ` growth ' rule [ growth ] , which has no counterpart at the right boundary .      in the deep model",
    "the system size is not conserved and continually increases , therefore care must be taken to define what is meant by a steady state .",
    "for example , the density at site @xmath20 will generally only become stationary with respect to a particular frame of reference .",
    "two natural frames to consider are the frame moving with the tip , in which case the tip is always at site 1 and the site label @xmath20 measures the distance from tip , and the stationary frame where the right boundary is always at site 1 and the tip is at site @xmath21 where @xmath21 increases as the lattice extends .",
    "a phase of the system is specified by stationary values of the densities and the frame of reference .",
    "moreover we shall encounter one phase , the maximal current phase , that does not satisfy this criterion and instead is only quasi - stationary .    to begin with",
    ", we choose to work in the reference frame of the growing lattice tip , so that the leftmost site is always labelled site 1",
    ". the input end of the lattice is site @xmath22 and process ( [ alpha ] ) may be formulated as there being a reservoir of particles of density @xmath0 at site @xmath23 . as time",
    "@xmath24 the system size @xmath25 , therefore we may write a boundary condition at the input end of the lattice as @xmath26    we now construct the equations for the steady state dynamics . note that when a growth event occurs , via process ( [ growth ] ) , all the previous lattice sites are relabelled @xmath27 .",
    "the exact equations for correlations functions in the steady state are : @xmath28\\tau_{2}\\rangle-(\\gamma+\\beta)\\langle\\tau_1\\rangle\\;,\\\\ \\label{tau2 } \\frac{d\\langle\\tau_2\\rangle}{dt}=0=\\langle[1-\\tau_2]\\tau_{3}\\rangle-\\langle[1-\\tau_{1}]\\tau_2\\rangle-\\gamma\\langle\\tau_1\\tau_2\\rangle\\;,\\\\ \\label{taui } \\frac{d\\langle\\tau_i\\rangle}{dt}=0=\\langle[1-\\tau_i]\\tau_{i+1}\\rangle-\\langle[1-\\tau_{i-1}]\\tau_i\\rangle+\\gamma\\langle\\tau_1[\\tau_{i-1}-\\tau_i]\\rangle\\quad i\\geq 3\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the occupancy at site i and can take on a value 1 or 0 .",
    "the angle brackets denote an average in the steady state .",
    "thus @xmath30 is the average occupancy in the steady state or particle _ density _ at site i. these equations may be understood in terms of a particle _ current _ along the lattice .",
    "the positive terms represent the current of particles entering the site from the right and the negative terms represent the current leaving to the left .",
    "the dynamics at sites 1 and 2 differ from those of the rest of the system due to the transition from particle to lattice site . in the steady state ,",
    "the current ` in ' balances the current ` out ' everywhere .",

    "however , although the qualitative results of this simple mean - field theory appear to be correct , the predicted phase boundaries do not all agree with simulation ( as we shall discuss in section [ sec : pd ] ) .",
    "thus in order to more accurately predict the phase boundaries , we develop a refined mean - field theory .",
    "in the approximation of the previous section , we ignored correlations between all pairs of sites in this system . in this section",

    "we can repeat this mean - field improvement scheme by taking into account more correlations and correspondingly beginning the iteration of ( [ rr ] ) further from the tip .",

    "an important feature which allows us to understand the phase behaviour of the tasep ( see figure [ taseppd ] ) is the presence of a symmetry between particles hopping in one direction and ` holes ' hopping in the opposite direction .",
    "the high density particle phase can therefore be understood as a low density hole phase and vice versa .    due to the moving boundary condition and the transition ( [ growth ] )",
    ", there is no exact microscopic symmetry between particles and holes in the deep dynamics .",
    "however , it is true that particles leave / holes enter at the tip whereas particles enter / holes leave at the right end .",
    "it is plausible then that there exists some symmetry between the high density phase ( low density of holes ) and the low density phase ( high density of holes ) .",
    "indeed , the phase boundaries between the high , low and maximal current phases predicted by the refined mean - field theory in the limit of @xmath92 display a symmetry under the interchange @xmath128 .",
    "but while the the velocities in the two phases , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , are also symmetric under the interchange @xmath128 , the bulk densities in these phases , @xmath0 and @xmath131 , are not symmetric .    in the case of @xmath132 ,",
    "the refined mean - field approximation no longer displays a particle hole symmetry . a heuristic argument however , does lead to a 3d phase transition between the high and low density phases which maintains a symmetry between input rate @xmath0 and output rate @xmath133 .",
    "if we ignore the density structure near the tip and assume that in the high density phase there exists a single high density value associated with the tip : @xmath134 , in the same way that in the low density phase , we have a single density @xmath0 associated with the input end of the lattice , then from ( [ vi]-[jv ] ) we have the following : @xmath135 this is solved to give the bulk density : @xmath136 and associated high density velocity : @xmath137    as before we appeal to the concept of a shock discontinuity in the system .",
    "the low density phase is reached when the shock velocity @xmath138 is greater than the tip velocity ( [ v_heur ] ) , which corresponds to a phase transition at : @xmath139 suggesting an exact correspondence between the balancing of input and output rates and the transition between high and low density phases .",

    "left : low density , shock profile , high density and maximal current phase .",
    "note that since the high density profile is calculated in the reference frame of the input , the sites are labelled from right to left , site 0 being where particles are injected . ]",
    "one property which may be used to locate the exact positions of the phase transitions is the lattice tip velocity , which is given by a simple function of the parameters and changes form across the phase boundaries ( see equations ( [ vld],[vhd],[maxv ] ) ) .",
    "we find from the velocity of the simulated lattices , that the first refined mean - field theory appears to predict the correct form for the tip velocity and the correct phase transitions .",
    "figure  [ montecarlov ] shows the velocity of a simulated lattice plotted for different values of @xmath7 , against the refined mean - field expression for the velocity .",
    "the velocities closely follow the predicted curve ( [ vldb0 ] ) and as expected , a phase transition takes place at @xmath143 , where the velocity becomes independent of @xmath0 . the maximum velocity is reached when @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the tip velocity plotted against @xmath0 for @xmath146 and @xmath92 . for @xmath147 , a clear phase transition occurs when @xmath148 .",
    "this transition is from the _ low density _ phase where @xmath149 to the _ high density phase _",
    ", where the velocity is @xmath0 independent . for clarity ,",
    "dotted lines are used to indicate @xmath143 .",
    "when @xmath150 , the maximum velocity occurs as predicted at @xmath144 .",
    "]    further evidence in support of the refined mean - field theory can be found by exploring the density profiles of the low density region , where the three theories predict different transitions between profiles which decay at the tip from below and above @xmath0 . in figure",
    "[ peak_decay ] , we see that the transition appears to agree with that predicted by the first refined theory , while being at odds with both the further refined and the simple approximations .    in the left - hand plot , the simple ( solid line ) , refined ( dashed line ) and further refined ( dotted line ) phase boundaries are shown .",
    "simulations were carried out in the low density phase , across the predicted boundary between profiles with a decay from above and below @xmath0 ( parameter values indicated with symbols ) .",
    "the resulting profiles , shown in the right - hand plot , display a transition that is in best agreement with the refined mean - field transition line . ]    for completeness , we consider now the case of non zero @xmath2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : withbeta ] the simulated growth velocities are compared to the refined mean - field theory velocity functions for the high and low density phases for @xmath132 .",
    "the high density velocity obtained from the heuristic argument is also shown and one may see that this coincides rather closely with the refined mean - field result . due to the nature of equations [ quadratic ] and inequality @xmath119 which must be solved simultaneously , in this case it is simpler to work with the velocity as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , simulations were carried out with fixed values @xmath151 and @xmath152 , in the range close to the phase transition @xmath153 .",
    "we see a good agreement of the simulation data points with the high density and the low density velocity functions predicted by the refined mean field theory .",
    "note however , that in the high density phase the simulation results appear after all to be in best agreement with the heuristic result for the velocity ( [ v_heur ] ) .",
    "the phase transition occurs as expected where the high and low velocity functions meet .",
    "theoretical and simulation results for the tip velocity as a function of @xmath7 , given for fixed values of @xmath0 and @xmath154 .",
    "the data points show simulation results , fitted to the heuristic and refined mean - field functions for the tip velocity in the high and low density phases .",
    "the low density velocity is the same for heuristic and mean - field approaches and is given by ( [ vld ] ) .",
    "the high density velocity function is found in the refined mean - field theory by solving equation ( [ quadratic ] ) and inequality @xmath119 ( explicit expression for the high density velocity is not presented here ) .",
    "the heuristic high density velocity is given by ( [ v_heur ] ) .",
    "the phase transition occurs at approximately @xmath155    finally , we present the detailed 2-d phase diagram of the first refined mean - field theory in the limit @xmath92 , shown in figure  [ imppd ] . the diagram is split into the three distinct phases : high , low and maximal current .",
    "the low density phase is split into two subregions i and ii , where the tip decays to the bulk density from above and below respectively .",
    "the shock region , where the shock recedes from both boundaries , is indicated within the high density phase .",
    "we believe this to be at least an accurate approximation to the exact phase structure as we discuss in the next section .    the phase diagram obtained from the refined mean - field approximation in the limit @xmath92 .",
    "three phases are shown . the low density phase is split into subregions i and ii , indicating regions where the density profile decays from above and below the bulk density respectively .",
    "the shock region is indicated within the high density phase . ]",
    "in this work we have studied a generalisation of the open boundary tasep to a dynamically extending lattice and characterised a generalised phase diagram in the @xmath156 parameter space .",
    "the model provides an example of a system where the dynamics of the microscopic constituents couple to and determine the dynamics of the containing structure .",
    "we conclude that steady states can exist in this system , where the lattice is continuously extending from one end while being supplied with particles from the other end .",
    "the well - known phases of the open boundary tasep are reflected in the phase diagram of this model ( figure  [ imppd ] ) .",
    "the low density phase has structure in the density profile near the tip and the bulk density is controlled by the low input rate at the opposite boundary . in the high density phase the bulk density is controlled by the tip dynamics and there is structure in the density profile near the opposite boundary . in between we have a shock region where a high density and a low density region are separated by a moving shock which in fact recedes from both boundaries .",
    "the shock region of the phase diagram extends the known phases and adds to the variety of shock formation phenomena which have been observed in the tasep and related models@xcite .",
    "finally , the maximal current phase is present but with bulk density @xmath157 .",
    "however , in this model the maximal current phase is not strictly a steady state as the current and the density profile continue to evolve as the system grows .",
    "we have used several mean - field approximations and find that while the simplest mean - field approach successfully predicts the qualitative behaviour of the phases , the phase boundaries are not accurately predicted . however , a refined mean - field approximation which takes into account the correlation between sites one and two predicts a phase diagram which appears to coincide very closely with simulation results and is very close to that deduced by the heuristic argument of section  [ sec : heur ] .",
    "it would be of interest to know whether in fact the predictions , summarised for the @xmath92 case in figure  [ imppd ] , could be exact .",
    "interestingly , taking into account a further correlation appeared to worsen the predicted phase diagram .",
    "this sort of negative result has been encountered in mean - field approximation schemes in the past @xcite .",
    "for example it was found in the zgb surface reaction model that a pair mean - field approximation successfully locates a discontinuous phase transition , while a four - site approximation seems to do worse @xcite .",
    "the deep was initially formulated as a model derived from the tasep of a biophysical growth process , namely fungal hyphal growth @xcite and provides a simple framework which may find application in a broader context .",
    "the tasep has been successfully developed to describe various biophysical transport problems by incorporating additional biological detail such as dynamic instabilities and heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "it could prove fruitful to study the effects of such features in the present model .",
    "we would like to thank wilson poon , nick read and graham wright for their encouragement and discussions on fungal biology , and graeme ackland for helpful comments .",
