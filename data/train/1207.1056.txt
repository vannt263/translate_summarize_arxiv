    "thereby , it is very unlikely to have values outside the interval @xmath151 $ ] and we loose little by assuming compact support .",
    "the same kind of assumption was made in the context of wavelet density estimation by  @xcite . in order to simplify the presentation of the results , one can simply rescale the data such that they fall into @xmath147 $ ] ( which covered the full range of all observed data ) .",

    "let us first consider a parallel system with @xmath145 identical independent components .",
    "then , the corresponding weighted function is and the goal is to estimate @xmath4 in from @xmath34 sample simulated from one of the test densities .",
    "a typical example of estimation for the kurtotic density ( for @xmath8 ) , with @xmath164 is given in figure  [ fig : single ] .",
    "the mean @xmath6 risk of @xmath104 i.e. , @xmath165 , is obtained with 10 samples for @xmath164 , and it is plotted as a function of @xmath162 in figure  [ fig : lprisk ] . as predicted by theorem  [ danzig2 ] , the larger @xmath162 , the smaller @xmath6 risk of @xmath104 .",
    "we can see that our estimation procedure provides better results than the term - by - term thresholding ( @xmath163 ) in all cases .",
    "in particular , the risk improvement achieved by the block estimators upon the term - by - term estimator is significant for the non - smooth uniform density .",
    "this is in agreement with the predictions of our theoretical findings .    to conclude this first example",
    ", we illustrate from a single simulation , the fact that the parameters dictated by the theory yield the expected performance .",
    "we display in figure  [ fig : univ ] the empirical @xmath166 risk as a function of the threshold level @xmath101 , where the vertical dashed line represents the universal threshold .",
    "one can see that the minimum of the @xmath166 risk is close to the universal threshold for all test densities , thus supporting the choice dictated by our theoretical procedure , although derived in an asymptotic setting .    in our second example",
    ", the adaptive estimator described in section [ applications1 ] is tested when @xmath5 follows a geometric distribution , so that the weight function is that given by .",
    "this example is devoted to a simulation study comparing the performance of the block hard thresholding estimator with that of the traditional kernel defined as follows @xmath167 where the positive kernel @xmath92 satisfies @xmath168 and the smoothing parameter @xmath169 is known as the bandwidth .    many procedures of bandwidth selection for kernel density estimation have been developed in the literature ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",

    "one frequently used cross - validation ( cv ) procedure is the k - fold cv ( as described e.g. in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.10 ) ) in which the data set @xmath174 is randomly partitioned into k approximately equal - sized and non - overlapping subsets @xmath175 . to obtain the bandwidths @xmath176 , we have performed a @xmath177-fold cv , using a gaussian kernel , with a simple `` rule - of - thumb '' pilot bandwidth @xmath178 .",
