    "for a given 1 - d potential @xmath11 with eigenfunctions @xmath12 and eigenvalues @xmath13 @xmath14 , we can generate a new family of potentials @xmath15 , isospectral to @xmath11 .",

    "we can write the superpotential as , @xmath20 the original potential @xmath11 can be expressed in terms of @xmath21 as , @xmath22 its isospectral partner @xmath15 is given by @xmath23 let @xmath24 be the eigenfunctions of @xmath15 @xmath25 .",

    "thus , @xmath15 is isospectral to @xmath11 , except that its spectrum does not contain @xmath29 .",
    "hence , to introduce the ground state into its spectrum and form a complete set of eigenstates , we need to find the most general superpotential @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 we can now show that @xmath33 where @xmath34 thus , in this process of reinstating the ground state , we obtain the expression for the potential @xmath15 in terms of @xmath35 as , @xmath36^{\\prime\\prime } \\,\\,=\\,\\,v(x)-\\frac{4u_0u^{\\prime}_0}{i_0+\\lambda } + \\frac{2u^{4}_0}{(i_0+\\lambda)^2}.     \\label{e7}\\ ] ] note that @xmath15 is @xmath11 plus a perturbative term and @xmath16 can be take as the perturbative parameter .",

    "note that the original potential @xmath11 had no integrable solutions but the new potential has one square - integrable solution @xmath29 , with the rest being non - integrable .",

[ lam2 ] and [ lam1 ] , we give the plots of the deformed wave functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 , for two different values of @xmath16 and @xmath49 .",

    "the perturbative parameters can be used to adjust the overlap of these trapped atoms and also to control the deformation of the periodic potential . moreover , these localized states are in the band and hence , protected from the external influences . since optical lattices are easy to create and manipulate in the laboratory , this can be a useful model for quantum networking [ [ palmer ] , [ jak ] , [ shloma ] ] .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to deform a periodic potential to accommodate localized states at the band edges .",
    "it is proposed that by trapping atoms in these states we can construct qubits and an array of @xmath83 such qubits can be used as a quantum network .      1 .",
