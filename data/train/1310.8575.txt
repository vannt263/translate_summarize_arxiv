    "primitive meteorites ( chondrites ) are the remnants of the first planetary bodies to accrete in the solar system .",
    "variations in the relative abundances of an element s isotopes in meteorites provide important information about the pre - solar chemical environment and the physical processes governing the formation and evolution of the solar system .",
    "the large majority of mass - independent isotopic variations ( i.e. isotopic variations after correction for traditional thermodynamic isotopic fractionation , in which the amount of fractionation scales in proportion to the mass difference between isotopes ) at the bulk - meteorite scale have been attributed to incomplete mixing of two ( or more ) isotopically distinct nucleosynthetic reservoirs within the solar nebula @xcite ; however , some variations have also been attributed to chemical fractionation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a lack of isotopic anomalies in bulk meteorites would suggest the complete homogenization of any distinct nucleosynthetic components , which resulted in a uniform early reservoir prior to planetesimal accretion .",
    "such homogenization has previously been suggested by analysis of several elements at the bulk - rock scale , including fe and zn @xcite .    of the light elements , o ,",
    "s , and ca show mass - independent fractionation in bulk meteorites @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of o isotope anomalies is debated ; variations may not reflect initial heterogeneity in the solar nebula since other mechanisms for mass - independent o isotope fractionation have been identified @xcite . after o and mg , si is the third lightest element with the three stable isotopes needed to determine mass - independent effects , and si is a major element in the terrestrial planets .",
    "silicon is composed of three stable isotopes : ^28^si ( 92.23% ) , ^29^si ( 4.68% ) , and ^30^si ( 3.09% ) .",
    "the most abundant isotope , ^28^si , is a principle product of oxygen burning in massive stars , and is produced in core - collapse supernovae and , to a lesser extent , type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "the two heavier stable isotopes of si , ^29^si and ^30^si , are secondary nucleosynthesis products and are mainly produced during carbon burning through the reaction of an @xmath0 particle with ^25^mg and ^26^mg , respectively .",
    "another production source of ^29^si and ^30^si is s - process neutron capture during he burning in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "large si isotopic anomalies are found in various types of presolar grains @xcite , and in fact the presence of si isotope abundances that are significantly different than solar si ratios is one identifying characteristic of a presolar grain .",
    "these anomalies have been attributed to distinct nucleosynthetic sources of si that condensed prior to the collapse of the solar nebula and therefore retained their individual isotopic signatures @xcite .",
    "however , the extent to which such reservoirs were mixed during nebular collapse remains open for debate .",
    "the isotopic analysis of bulk meteorites can provide information about the level of homogenization of material within the solar nebula .",
    "early searches for si isotopic anomalies in bulk meteorites found only mass - dependent isotope fractionation @xcite , but advances in multi - collector inductively - coupled - plasma mass - spectrometery ( mc - icp - ms ) have improved analytical precision by a factor of three .",
    "the current level of precision of 15 ppm ( 2@xmath1 ) has made it possible to refine the search for inherited presolar nucleosynthetic heterogeneities that were preserved during accretion in the solar nebula .",
    "this study presents high - precision si isotopic measurements on a wide range of terrestrial and meteorite samples in order to quantify possible heterogeneities in si isotope composition at the bulk - rock scale . at the current level of precision ,",
    "si isotopes display widespread homogeneity across bulk solar system materials , suggesting that inherited si isotopic anomalies were erased through mixing in the solar nebula prior to planetary accretion .",
    "a possible exception is the angrites , which may exhibit small excesses of ^29^si .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results on the distribution of mg isotopes .",
    "this study reports the si isotopic composition of a wide range of bulk solar system materials , including chondritic meteorites ( 5 ordinary chondrites , 8 carbonaceous chondrites , 6 enstatite h chondrites , and 7 enstatite l chondrites ) , achondritic meteorites ( 6 martian meteorites , 2 howardites , 9 eucrites , 3 diogenites , 5 angrites ) , and 16 terrestrial basalts .",
    "achondrites represent the differentiated silicate fraction of planetary bodies .",
    "the achondrite samples reported here are believed to represent mars , the asteroid 4-vesta ( in the case of the howardites , eucrites , and diogenites ) , and the angrite parent body .",

    "the lack of any resolvable si isotopic anomalies within the current level of precision at the bulk - rock scale in either primitive chondrites or meteorites derived from differentiated parent bodies ( with the exception of angrites , see below ) suggests that any inherited nucleosynthetic variations in si isotopes were erased through mixing in the solar nebula prior to the formation of planetesimals .",

    "furthermore , the single allende cai analyzed here has a si isotopic composition that is indistinguishable from bulk chondrites and terrestrial samples , suggesting that the homogenization of si isotopes occurred at the mineral scale as early as the age of the cais ( 4.567 - 4.568 ga ; * ? ? ?",

    "the homogeneous distribution of si isotopes has important implications for the distribution of mg isotopes in the solar nebula .",
    "the presence of anomalies in mg isotope abundances would have consequences for the ^26^al-^26^mg short - lived isotope system ( t@xmath7 = 0.73 myr ) , which is a principal chronometer for dating accretion and differentiation events in the early solar system @xcite .",
    "a heterogeneous distribution of mg isotopes in the pre - solar disk that was preserved in solar system materials during planetary accretion could lead to erroneous ^26^al-^26^mg model ages . @xcite",
    "found heterogeneities in the ^26^mg excesses ( @xmath8 ^ 26^mg ) present in planetary samples with near - solar al / mg ratios .",
    "however , this heterogeneity can have two possible origins : ( 1 ) heterogeneous distribution of mg isotopes or ( 2 ) variations in the ^26^al/^27^al ratio within the solar nebula .",
    "the determination of mg isotope anomalies attributable to incomplete nucleosynthetic source mixing is hindered by the input of ^26^mg from ^26^al radioactive decay , since the contribution of radiogenic ^26^mg obscures the interpretation of nucleosynthetic isotope effects .",
    "the investigation of correlations in isotopic patterns in elements with related nucleosynthetic sources has been used to quantify possible heterogeneities in the early solar system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the chance of this thermal decoupling is minimized in elements with similar volatilities in the solar nebula , characterized by the 50% condensation temperature ( denoted t@xmath9 ) .",
    "therefore , the comparable volatilities of si and mg ( t@xmath9 si = 1310 k ; t@xmath9 mg = 1336 k ; * ? ? ?",

    "figure 2 shows si and mg isotope mass fractions as a function of interior mass in a 25 solar mass supernova ejecta of the stellar model s25a37j of @xcite .",
    "explosive carbon burning occurring in the outer layers of the supernova produces large excesses in ^29^si and ^30^si , while ^28^si is mainly produced by oxygen burning in more interior regions .",
    "the pattern of mg isotope production is different ; ^24^mg , ^25^mg , and ^26^mg are all co - produced during carbon burning .",
    "the outer regions of the supernova are only slightly enriched in the neutron - rich isotopes ^25^mg and ^26^mg , and , as a result , the magnitude of the heavy - isotope overabundance is smaller for mg than for si .",
    "consequently , any excess in neutron - rich mg isotopes would be associated with a much larger effect on neutron - rich si isotopes . following this logic",
    ", @xcite suggested that the calculated si isotopic effect would be 75 times larger than the mg isotopic effect .",
    "the si isotopic homogeneity of solar system material as indicated by this study ( at @xmath5 15 ppm ) implies that mg isotopes were also well mixed ( at least at a 15 ppm level ) .",
    "therefore , the heterogeneous distribution of ^26^mg excesses across solar system materials ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) must reflect heterogeneous distribution of the al isotope ratio .",
    "the case of the small anomalies ( @xmath4 ^ 29^si = 0.18 @xmath5 0.10 , 2 se , n = 5 ) found in the angrites is puzzling .",
    "the mechanism by which a group of differentiated meteorites could preserve isotopic anomalies while all chondritic meteorites are isotopically homogenized is unclear .",
    "use of the wrong power law for data normalization could introduce artificial isotopic effects in samples for which large mass dependent isotopic fractionation occurred due to a non - equilibrium ( kinetic ) process ( e.g. evaporation ) . in this case , the fractionation would follow a rayleigh distillation , and the generalized power law with exponent n = -@xmath10 would be the appropriate normalization scheme instead of the exponential case ( generalized power law with exponent n = 0 ) used here @xcite .",
    "in other words , the si isotopic fractionation between state a and state b can be expressed in terms of two fractionation factors @xmath0 @xcite such that @xmath11 where x = 29 or 30 , which are related by the expression @xmath12 where the exponent is expressed as @xmath13 in the case of equilibrium fractionation and @xmath14 in the case of kinetic fractionation , and m@xmath15 , m@xmath16 , and m@xmath17 are the masses of ^28^si , ^29^si , and ^30^si , respectively .",
    "numerically , the difference between equilibrium fractionation and kinetic fractionation changes the value of the exponent @xmath18 in equation ( 3 ) from 0.5178 ( equilibrium fractionation , equation ( 4 ) ) to 0.5092 ( kinetic fractionation , equation ( 5 ) ) .",
    "the magnitude of the error introduced on @xmath4 ^ 29^si through the use of an inappropriate normalization correction can be calculated from equation ( 6 ) , adapted from the example given for ^60^ni by @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the power law exponents for rayleigh or exponential isotopic fractionation , respectively ( i.e. , @xmath20 = - , @xmath21 = 0 ) , and @xmath22 is the isotopic fractionation in permil / amu . to account for the observed @xmath4 ^ 29^si for the angrite average , a si isotopic fractionation between 1 and 2 permil / amu ( i.e. , 10 - 20 @xmath4-units on the ^29^si/^28^si ratio ) would be required .",
    "this exceeds by more than an order of magnitude the mass - dependent fractionation measured to date in bulk meteorite materials ( which is currently less than 0.1 permil / amu , or 1 @xmath4-unit on ^29^si/^28^si ) .",
    "therefore , the use of an inappropriate normalization scheme is an unlikely explanation to fully account for the si isotopic anomalies in the angrite data .",
    "this suggests that angrites have preserved some small si isotopic heterogeneity , the reasons for which are still unknown .",
    "these ^29^si excesses may have implications for the distribution of mg isotopes .",
    "unfortunately , there is only one sample ( dorbigny ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for which both si isotopic data and the initial @xmath8 ^ 26^mg value are available , so it is impossible to interpret both isotopic systems at this stage .",
    "however , it has been noted that angrites have high initial @xmath8 ^ 26^mg compared to other differentiated meteorites @xcite , which could suggest some possible mg isotope heterogeneity in line with ^29^si excesses .",
    "after correction for mass - dependent isotopic fractionation , the si isotopic composition of most meteorite groups is not resolvable from terrestrial composition within the current level of analytical precision .",
    "the lack of si isotopic anomalies at the bulk - rock scale in solar system materials indicates homogenization of material in the solar nebula prior to planetary accretion .",

    "<S> the presence or absence of variations in the mass - independent abundances of si isotopes in bulk meteorites provides important clues concerning the evolution of the early solar system . </S>",
    "<S> no si isotopic anomalies have been found within the level of analytical precision of 15 ppm in ^29^si/^28^si across a wide range of inner solar system materials , including terrestrial basalts , chondrites , and achondrites . </S>",
    "<S> a possible exception is the angrites , which may exhibit small excesses of ^29^si . </S>",
    "<S> however , the general absence of anomalies suggests that primitive meteorites and differentiated planetesimals formed in a reservoir that was isotopically homogenous with respect to si . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the lack of resolvable anomalies in the calcium - aluminum - rich inclusion measured here suggests that any nucleosynthetic anomalies in si isotopes were erased through mixing in the solar nebula prior to the formation of refractory solids . </S>",
    "<S> the homogeneity exhibited by si isotopes may have implications for the distribution of mg isotopes in the solar nebula . based on supernova nucleosynthetic yield calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the expected magnitude of heavy - isotope overabundance is larger for si than for mg , suggesting that any potential mg heterogeneity , if present , exists below the 15 ppm level . </S>"
