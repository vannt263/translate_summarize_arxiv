    "in classical physics information is represented as a binary sequence , i.e a sequence of bit values , each of which can be either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "when we read out information that is carried by a classical system we reveal a certain bit value that exists even before the reading of information is performed .",
    "for example , when we read out a bit value encoded as a pit on a compact disk , we reveal a property of the disk existing before the reading process .",
    "this means that in a classical measurement the particular sequence of bit values obtained can be considered to be physically defined by the properties of the classical system measured even in these cases where classical physics instead of definite measurement results predicts these results with certain probabilities , it is still possible at least in principle , to consider an ensemble of statistically distributed measurement results as revealing corresponding statistically distributed properties of the ensemble of classical systems . ] .",
    "the information read is then measured by the shannon measure of information @xcite which can operationally be defined as the number of binary questions ( questions with ",
    " no  answers only ) needed to determine the actual sequence of 0 s and 1 s .    in quantum physics information",
    "is represented by a sequence of qubits , each of which is defined in a two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "if we read out the information carried by the qubit , we have to project the state of the qubit onto the measurement basis @xmath2 which will give us a bit value of either 0 or 1 . only in the exceptional case of the qubit in an eigenstate of the measurement apparatus",
    "the bit value observed reveals a property already carried by the qubit . yet in general the value obtained by the measurement has an element of irreducible randomness and therefore can not be assumed to reveal the bit value or even a hidden property of the system existing before the measurement is performed .",
    "this implies that in a sequence of measurements on qubits in a superposition state @xmath3 @xmath4 the particular sequence of bit values 0 and 1 obtained can not , not even in principle projection operators which represent the yes - no questions about an individual system , such that none of the @xmath5 possible sets of answers is compatible with the sum rule of quantum mechanics for orthogonal decomposition of identity @xcite ( i.e. if the sum of a subset of mutually commuting projection operators is the identity one and only one of the corresponding answers ought to be  yes  ) .",
    "this means that it is not possible to assign a definite unique answer to every single yes - no question represented by a projection operator independent of which subset of mutually commuting projection operators one might consider it with together .",
    "if there are no definite ( context - independent ) answers to all possible yes - no questions that can be asked about the system then the operational concept of the shannon measure of information itself , defined as the number of yes - no questions needed to determine the particular answers the system gives , becomes highly problematic .",
    "] , be considered in any way to be defined before the measurements are performed .",
    "the non - existence of well - defined bit values prior to and independent of observation suggests that the shannon measure , as defined by the number of binary questions needed to determine the particular _ observed _ sequence 0 s and 1 s , becomes problematic and even untenable in defining our uncertainty as given _ before _ the measurements are performed .    here",
    "we will critically analyze the applicability of the axiomatic derivation of the shannon measure for the case of quantum measurement .",
    "we will also show that shannon information is not useful in defining the information content in a quantum system .",
    "in fact we will see that when we try to apply shannon s postulate in quantum measurements or when we try to define the information content by the shannon information a certain element emerges that escapes complete and full description in quantum mechanics .",
    "this element is always associated with the objective randomness of individual quantum events and with quantum complementarity . in the end",
    "we will briefly discuss a novel and more suitable measure of information @xcite . yet",
    "at first we will return to a discussion in more detail of the operational definition of shannon information to quantum measurements .",
    "for classical observations shannon s measure of information can conceptually be motivated through an operational approach to the question .",
    "we will follow the introduction of shannon s measure of information as given by uffink @xcite .",
    "consider an urn filled with n colored balls .",
    "there are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , ... , @xmath8 balls with various different colors : black , white , ... , red .",
    "now the urn is shaken , and we draw one after the other all balls from the urn .",
    "to what extent can we predict the particular color sequence drawn ?",
    "certainly , if all the balls in the urn are of the same color , we can completely predict the color sequence . on the other hand ,",
    "if the various colors are present in equal proportions and if we have no knowledge about the arrangement of the balls after shaking the urn , we are maximally uncertain about the color sequence drawn .",
    "as noticed in @xcite one can think of these situations as extreme cases on a varying scale of predictability .",
    "for example , for n=4 , there is only one color sequence @xmath9@xmath9@xmath9@xmath9 if all balls are white , 4 possible color sequences @xmath10@xmath9@xmath9@xmath9 , @xmath9@xmath10@xmath9@xmath9 , @xmath9@xmath9@xmath10@xmath9 , @xmath9@xmath9@xmath9@xmath10 , if there are three black and one white ball in the urn , yet 6 possible color sequences @xmath10@xmath10@xmath9@xmath9 , @xmath10@xmath9@xmath10@xmath9 , @xmath10@xmath9@xmath9@xmath10 , @xmath9@xmath10@xmath10@xmath9 , @xmath9@xmath10@xmath9@xmath10 and @xmath9@xmath9@xmath10@xmath10 if there are two black and two white balls in the urn .",
    "this suggest that the uncertainty we have before drawing about the particular color sequence that will be drawn is defined by the total number of different possible color sequences that are in accordance with the given number of balls with their respective colors in the urn .",
    "consider now a situation where a long sequence of n balls are drawn from an infinite `` sea '' of balls with proportions @xmath11 , @xmath12 , ... , @xmath13 for the different colours in the sea .",
    "then a long sequence contains with high probability about @xmath14 balls of the first colour , @xmath15 balls of the second colour etc .",
    "( such a sequence is called typical sequence ) . the probability to obtain a particular typical sequence ( particular colour sequence ) is given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the shannon information expressed in bits with the logarithm taken to base 2 .",
    "consequently , the total number of distinct typical sequences is given by @xmath18    suppose now that one wishes to identify a specific color sequence of the drawn balls from the complete set of possible color sequences by asking questions to which only  yes  or  no  can be given as an answer .",
    "of course , the number of questions needed will depend on the questioning strategy adopted . in order to make this strategy the most optimal , that is , in order that we can expect to gain maximal information from each yes - or - no question , we evidently have to ask questions whose answers will strike out always half of the possibilities .",
    "since there are @xmath19 possible different ( typical ) color sequences ( all of them have equal probability to be drawn ) , the minimal number of yes - no questions needed is just @xmath20 . or equivalently , the shannon information expressed in bits is the minimal number of yes - no questions necessary to determine which particular sequence of outcomes occurs , divided by @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "a particular color sequence is specified by writing down , in order , the yes s and no s encountered in traveling from the root to the specific leaf of the tree as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ generalbaum ] for an explicit example with an urn containing black and white balls only .",
    "if instead of balls with pre - assigned colors we consider quantum systems whose individual properties are not defined before the measurements are performed , does the shannon measure of information still define the information gain in the measurements appropriately ?",
    "more precisely , we ask here the question whether the total number @xmath19 of different possible ( typical ) sequences of outcomes is suitable as a measure of our uncertainty before the sequence of quantum measurements is performed .    in classical physics the behavior of",
    "the whole ensemble follows from the behavior of its intrinsic different individual constituents which can be thought of as being defined to any precision .",
    "this is not the case in quantum mechanics .",
    "the principal indefiniteness , in the sense of fundamental nonexistence of a detailed description of and prediction for the individual quantum event resulting in the particular measurement result , implies that the particular sequence of outcomes specified by writing down , in order , the yes s and no s encountered in a row of yes / no questions asked is not defined before the measurements are performed .",
    "no definite outcomes exists before measurements are performed and therefore the number of different possible sequence of outcomes does not characterize our uncertainty about the individual system given before measurements are performed .    however , once the sequence of quantum measurements is performed and the measurement results are obtained , the measure of information needed to specify the particular sequence of outcomes realized is defined appropriately by the shannon measure . in the sense that an individual quantum event manifests itself only in the measurement process and is not precisely defined before measurement is performed , we may speak of  generation  of that specific information in the measurement .",
    "as observed by uffink @xcite , an important reason for preferring the shannon measure of information lies in the fact that it is uniquely characterized by shannon s intuitively reasonable postulates .",
    "this has been expressed strongly by jaynes @xcite : ",
    "one ... important reason for preferring the shannon measure is that it is the only one that satisfies ... [ shannon s postulates ] .",
    "therefore one expects that any deduction made from other information measures , if carried far enough , will eventually lead to contradiction .  a good way to continue our discussion is by reviewing how shannon , using his postulates , arrived at his famous expression .",
    "he writes @xcite :     suppose we have a set of possible events whose probabilities of occurrence are @xmath22 .",
    "these probabilities are known but that is all we know concerning which event will occur .",
    "can we find a measure of how much ",
    "choice  is involved in the selection of the event or how uncertain we are of the outcome ?    if there is such a measure , say @xmath23 , it is reasonable to require of it the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath24 should be continuous in the @xmath25 .",
    "if all the @xmath25 are equal , @xmath26 , then @xmath24 should be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath27 . with equally likely events",
    "there is more choice , or uncertainty , when there are more possible events .",
    "if a choice be broken down into two successive choices , the original @xmath24 should be the weighted sum of the individual values of @xmath24 .",
    "the meaning of this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ choicefig ] . at the left we have three possibilities",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . on the right we first choose between two possibilities each with probability @xmath31 , and",
    "if the second occurs make another choice with probabilities @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the final results have the same probabilities as before .",
    "we require , in this special case , that @xmath34 the coefficient @xmath31 is the weighing factor introduced because this second choice occurs half the time . ",
    "shannon then shows that only the function ( [ who ] ) satisfies all three postulates .",
    "it is the third postulate which determines the logarithm form of the function and , as we will argue , it is this postulate which leads to problems when quantum measurements are involved .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of shannon s postulates .",
    "while the first two postulates are natural for every meaningful measure of information , the last postulate might deserve more justification the third shannon postulate originally formulated as an example was reformulated as an exact rule by faddeev @xcite : for every @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 .    without physical interpretation the recursion postulate ( the name was suggested in @xcite ) ( [ popmilo ] ) is merely a mathematical expression which is certainly necessary for the uniqueness of the function ( [ who ] ) but has no further physical significance .",
    "we adopt the following well - known interpretation @xcite .",
    "assume the possible outcomes of the experiment to be @xmath38 and @xmath39 to represent the amount of information that is gained by the performance of the experiment .",
    "now , decompose event @xmath40 into two distinct events @xmath41 and @xmath42 (  @xmath43  denotes  and  , thus @xmath44 denotes a joint event ) .",
    "denote the probabilities of outcomes @xmath41 and @xmath42 by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "then the left - hand side @xmath47 of eq .",
    "( [ popmilo ] ) represents the amount of information that is gained by the performance of the experiment with outcomes @xmath48 .",
    "when the outcome @xmath40 occurs , the conditional probabilities for @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively and the amount of information gained by the performance of the conditional experiment is @xmath53 .",
    "hence the recursion requirement states that the information gained in the experiment with outcomes @xmath54 equals the _ sum _ of the information gained in the experiment with outcomes @xmath38 and the information gained in the conditional experiment with outcomes @xmath49 or @xmath55 , given that the outcome @xmath40 occurred with probability @xmath56 .",
    "this interpretation implies that the third postulate can be rewritten as @xmath57 where @xmath58 here @xmath59 @xmath60 denotes the conditional probability for outcome @xmath40 given the outcome @xmath61 occurred and @xmath62 denotes the joint probability that outcome @xmath63 occurs .",
    "if we analyze the generalized situation with @xmath27 outcomes @xmath64 of the first experiment @xmath65 , @xmath66 outcomes @xmath67 of the conditional experiment @xmath68 and @xmath69 outcomes @xmath70 of the joint experiment @xmath71 , we may then rewrite the recursion postulate in a short form as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the average information gained by observation @xmath68 given that the conditional outcome @xmath74 occurred weighted by probability @xmath75 for @xmath74 to occur .    it is essential to note that the recursion postulate is inevitably related to the manner in which we gain information in a classical measurement .",
    "in fact , in classical measurements it is always possible to assign to a system simultaneously attributes corresponding to all possible measurements , here @xmath64 , @xmath67 and @xmath70 .",
    "also , the interaction between measuring apparatus and classical system can be thought to be made arbitrarily small so that the experimental determination of @xmath65 has no influence on our possibility to predict the outcomes of the possible future experiment @xmath68 . in conclusion ,",
    "the information expected in a classical experiment from the joint experiment @xmath76 is simply the sum of the information expected from the first experiment @xmath65 and the conditional information of the second experiment @xmath68 with respect to the first , as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ hannah ] ) .",
    "therefore , only for the special case of commuting , i.e. simultaneously definite observables , the axiomatic derivation of the shannon measure of information is applicable and the use of the shannon information is justified to define the uncertainty given before quantum measurements are performed .",
    "however , in general , if @xmath65 and @xmath68 are noncommuting observables , the joint probabilities on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ popciro ] ) can not in principle be assigned to a system simultaneously , and consequently shannon s crucial third postulate which is necessary for the uniqueness of shannon s measure of information ceases to be well - defined .",
    "having seen that the third shannon postulate in general is not applicable in quantum measurements we next introduce two requirements that are immediate consequences of shannon s postulates and in which all the probabilities that appear are well - defined in quantum mechanics .",
    "we will show that the two requirements are violated by the information gained in quantum measurements implying that the shannon measure loses its preferential status with respect to alternative expressions when applied to define information gain in quantum measurements .    1 .",
    "_ every new observation reduces our ignorance and increases our knowledge . _ in his work shannon @xcite offers a list of properties to substantiate that @xmath24 is a reasonable measure of information .",
    "he writes :  it is easily shown that @xmath77 with equality only if the events are independent ( i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "the uncertainty of a joint event is less than or equal to the sum of the individual uncertainties  .",
    "he continues further in the text :  ... we have @xmath79 hence , @xmath80 the uncertainty of @xmath68 is never increased by knowledge of @xmath65 .",
    "it will be decreased unless @xmath65 and @xmath68 are independent events , in which case it is not changed  ( we have changed shannon s notation to coincide with that of our work ) .",
    "information is indifferent on the order of acquisition . _",
    "the total amount of information gained in successive measurements is independent of the order in which it is acquired , so that the amount of information gained by the observation of @xmath65 followed by the observation of @xmath68 is equivalent to the amount of information gained from the observation of @xmath68 followed by the observation of @xmath65 @xmath81 this is an immediate consequence of the recursive postulate which can be obtained when we write the recursion postulate in two different ways depending on whether the observation of @xmath65 is followed by the observation of @xmath68 or vice versa .",
    "an explicit example for a sequence of classical measurements is given in fig .",

    "are these two requirements satisfied by information gained in quantum measurements ?",
    "consider a beam of randomly polarized photons .",
    "filters @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are oriented vertically , at @xmath85 , and horizontally respectively , and can be placed so as to intersect the beam of photons ( fig . [ filters ] ) .",
    "if we insert filter @xmath82 the number of photons observed at the detection plate will be approximately half of the number in the incoming beam .",
    "the outgoing photons now all have vertical polarization .",
    "notice that the function of filter @xmath82 can not be explained as a  sieve  that only lets those photons pass that are _ already _ of vertical polarization in the incoming beam .",
    "if that were the case , only a certain small number of the randomly polarized incoming photons would have vertical polarization , so we would expect a much larger attenuation of the beam of photons as they pass the filter .",
    "denote with @xmath65 and @xmath68 properties of the photon to have polarization at @xmath85 and horizontal polarization , respectively . if @xmath84 is inserted behind the filter @xmath82 we are certain that none of the photons will pass through ( fig .",
    "[ filters]a ) . for a photon with vertical polarization",
    "we have complete knowledge of the property @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "notice that a  sieve  model could explain this behaviour .",
    "if we now insert @xmath83 between @xmath82 and @xmath84 we observe an effect which can not be explained by a sieve model where the filter does not change the object . however we now observe a certain number of photons at the detection plate ( about @xmath87 of the number of photons in the beam passed through @xmath82 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ filters]b . in this case",
    "our knowledge of the property @xmath68 is not complete anymore .",
    "the acquisition of information about property @xmath65 therefore leads to a decrease of our knowledge about property @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath88 .",
    "note that on the photons absorbed by the filter @xmath83 we can not measure property @xmath68 subsequently .",
    "however already for the subensemble of the photons passing through the filter our uncertainty about property @xmath68 becomes larger than 0 implying @xmath89 which clearly violates requirement ( [ mrgo ] ) .",
    "another example of sequence of quantum measurements where requirement ( [ blondie ] ) is violated is given in fig . [ qballs ] .",
    "clearly , violation of the requirements ( [ mrgo ] ) and ( [ blondie ] ) occurs when the corresponding operators @xmath65 and @xmath68 do not commute .    what is the origin of the violation of the requirements ( [ mrgo ] ) and ( [ blondie ] ) in quantum measurements ?",
    "in contrast to a classical measurement which just adds some new knowledge to our knowledge at hand from the previous measurements , in a quantum measurement the gain of the new knowledge is always at the expense of irrecoverable loss of complementary classes of knowledge .",
    "this originates from the distinction between  total  and  complete  information in quantum physics . in classical physics the total information about a system is complete . in quantum physics the total information of a system , represented by the state vector , is never complete in the sense that all possible future measurement results are precisely defined - function is a specific representation of the catalog of our knowledge of the system .",
    "this view was assumed by schrdinger @xcite who wrote : ",
    "sie ( ( die @xmath90-funktion ) ) ist jetzt das instrument zur vorausage der wahrscheinlichkeit von mazahlen . in ihr ist die jeweils erreichte summe theoretisch begrndeter zukunfterwartungen verkrpert , gleichsam wie in einem _ katalog _ niedergelegt .",
    "translated :  it ( the @xmath90-function ) is now the means for predicting the probability of measurement results . in it",
    "is embodied the momentarily attained sum of theoretically based future expectation , somewhat as laid down in a _ catalog .  _ ] .",
    "in fact , the total information of a quantum system suffices to specify the eigenstate of one nondegenerate ( with one - dimensional eigenspaces only ) observable only .",
    "for example , the state of a photon passing through filter @xmath82 is specified by the complete knowledge about the property @xmath65 of vertical polarization . if we let a photon in this state pass through filter @xmath83 as given in fig .",
    "[ filters]b , our knowledge of the photon changes , and therefore its representation , the quantum state , also changes .",
    "the total information of a photon in the new state is completely exhausted in specifying property @xmath68 of polarization at @xmath91 and no further information is left to also specify property @xmath65 , thus implying unavoidable loss of the previous knowledge about this property .",
    "this further implies that the set of future probabilistic predictions specified by the new projected state is indifferent to the knowledge collected from the previous measurements in the whole history of the system .",
    "such a view was assumed by pauli @xcite who writes :  bei unbestimmtheit einer eigenschaft eines systems bei einer bestimmten anordnung ( bei einem bestimmten zustand des systems ) vernichtet jeder versuch , die betreffende eigenschaft zu messen , ( mindestend teilweise ) den einflu der frheren kenntnisse vom system auf die ( eventuell statistischen ) aussagen ber sptere mgliche messungsergebnisse .",
    " this clearly makes possible to violate requirements ( [ mrgo ] ) and ( [ blondie ] ) in quantum measurements .    here",
    "a certain misconception might be put forward that arises from a certain practical point of view . according to that view , for example ,",
    "complementarity between interference pattern and information about the path of the particle in the double - slit experiment is considered to arise from the fact that any attempt to observe the particle path would be associated with an uncontrollable disturbance of the particle .",
    "such a disturbance in itself would then be the reason for the loss of the interference pattern .",
    "in such of view it would be possible to define shannon s information for all attributes of the system simultaneously , and the third shannon postulate , as well as the requirements ( [ mrgo ] ) and ( [ blondie ] ) , would be violated because of the unavoidable disturbance of the system occurring whenever the subsequently measured property @xmath68 is incompatible with the previous one @xmath65 . yet , this is a misconception for two reasons .",
    "firstly , as theorems like those of bell @xcite or greenberger , horne and zeilinger @xcite show , it is not possible , not even _ in principle _ , to assign to a quantum system simultaneously observation - independent properties which in order to be in agreement with special relativity have to be local .",
    "we therefore can not speak of a  disturbance  in the measurement process if there are no objective properties to disturb .    secondly , over the last few years experiments were considered and some already performed , where the reason why no interference pattern arises is not due to any uncontrollable disturbance of the quantum system or the clumsiness of the apparatus . rather the lack of interference is due to the fact that the quantum state is prepared in such a way as to permit path _ information _ to be obtained , in principle , independent of whether the experimenter cares to read it out or not .",
    "one line of such research considers the use of micromasers in atomic beam experiments @xcite , another one concerns experiments on correlated photon states emerging from nonlinear crystals through the process of parametric - down conversion @xcite .",
    "the view that complementarity must be based on the much more fundamentally property of mutual exclusiveness of different classes of information of a quantum system was assumed by pauli @xcite in the analysis of the uncertainty relations :  ... diese relationen enthalten die aussage , da jede genaue kenntnis des teilchenortes zugleich eine prinzipielle unbestimmtheit , nicht nur unbekanntheit des impulses zur folge hat und umgekehrt .",
    "die unterscheidung zwischen ( prinzipieller ) _ unbestimmtheit _ und _ unbekanntheit _ und der zusammenhang beider begriffe sind fr die ganze quantentheorie entscheidend . ",
    "to define the information content of a physical system one might consider different measures of information . however",
    "only those measures of information have physical significance according to which the defined information content of the system possesses properties which naturally follow from the physical situation considered",
    ". these properties are , for example , invariance under changes of the modes of observation of the system and conservation in time if there is no information exchange with an environment .",
    "we show now that the information content of a quantum system , if it is assumed to be measured by the shannon measure of information , can not be defined in any way to have these properties .",
    "the classical world appears to be composed of particles and fields , and the properties of each one of these constituents could be specified quite independently of the particular phenomenon discussed or of the experimental procedure a physicist chooses to determine these properties .",
    "in other words the properties of constituents of the classical world are noncontextual .    in particular ,",
    "the total lack of information about a classical pointlike system ( with no rotational and internal degrees of freedom ) defined as shannon s information associated with the probability distribution over the phase space is independent of the specific set of variables chosen to describe the system completely ( such as position and momentum , or bijective functions of them ) and conserved in time if there is no information exchange with an environment ( i.e. if the system is dynamically independent from the environment and not exposed to a measurement ) over the phase space the total lack of information of a classical system is defined as @xcite @xmath92 where a background measure @xmath93 is an additional ingredient that has to be added to the formalism to ensure invariance under change of variables when we consider continuous probability distributions .",
    "the conservation of @xmath94 in time for a system with no information exchange with an environment is implied by the hamiltonian evolution of a point in phase space . ] .",

    "contrary to the classical concepts most quantum - mechanical concepts are limited to the description of phenomena within some well - defined experimental context , that is , always restricted to a specific experimental procedure the physicist chooses .",
    "in particular the amount of information gained in an individual quantum measurement depends strongly on the specific experimental context . in the optimal experiment when the measurement basis @xmath96 coincides with the eigenbasis of the density matrix @xmath97 of the system :",
    "@xmath98 the amount of information gained is maximal ( see for example @xcite ) . since in the basis corresponding to the optimal experiment",
    "the density operator is represented by a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath99 , the information gain defined by the shannon measure equals the von neumann entropy as given by the von neumann entropy @xmath100 is widely accepted as a suitable definition for the information content of a quantum system . for a system described in @xmath21-dimensional hilbert space this ranges from @xmath101 for a completely mixed state to 0 for a pure state .",

    "however , we observe that any function of the form @xmath102 ( the operator @xmath103 is identified by having the same eigenstates as @xmath97 and the eigenvalues @xmath104 , equal to the function values taken at the eigenvalues @xmath105 of @xmath97 . ) possesses this invariance property .",

    "the invariance under unitary transformations implies invariance under the change of the representation ( basis ) of @xmath97 and conservation in time if there is no information exchange with an environment .",

    "the optimal measurement is a classical type measurement and therefore in this particular case , and only then , shannon s measure defines the information gain in a measurement appropriately systems where each individual system is drawn from an ensemble of pure states @xmath112 , with frequency of occurrence @xmath113 respectively .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for sufficiently large @xmath21 there are @xmath114 highly distinguishable sequences of pure states which become mutually orthogonal as @xmath115 . here",
    "@xmath116 is the von neumann entropy and @xmath117 .",
    "this means that if the sender uses a sequence consisting of a choice of states that respects the a priori frequencies @xmath99 , and the receiver distinguishes whole sequences rather than individual states , then the ( shannon ) information transmitted per system can be made arbitrary close to @xmath118 . here",
    "again the total density matrix @xmath119 of @xmath21 systems can be made arbitrary close to the one as if we had a classical mixture of the @xmath120 sequences of states . ] .",
    "considering also our previous discussion it is therefore not surprising that shannon s measure is useful only when applied to measurements which can be understood as classical measurements .    which set of individual measurements should we perform and how to combine individual measures of information obtained in the set in order to arrive at the information content of a quantum system if we do not know the eigenbasis of the density matrix ?",
    "quantum complementarity implies that the total information content of the system might be partially encoded in different mutually exclusive ( complementary ) observables .",
    "these have the property that complete knowledge of the eigenvalue of any one of the observables excludes _ any _ knowledge about the eigenvalues of all other observables .",
    "such a set of observables for a spin-1/2 particle can for example be spin components along orthogonal directions .",
    "we consider now a quantum system described in @xmath27 dimensional hilbert space and we denote a complete set of @xmath66 mutually complementary observables density matrix completely one needs @xmath121 independent real numbers . any individual , complete measurement ( we consider here only complete measurements , i.e. , where operators associated to the measurements are without degeneracy ) with @xmath27 possible outcomes defines @xmath122 independent probability values ( the sum of all probabilities for all possible outcomes in an individual experiment is one ) .",
    "therefore , just on the basis of counting the number of independent variables , we expect that the number of different measurements we need in order to determine the density matrix completely is @xmath123 .",
    "ivanovic @xcite , and wootters and fields @xcite demonstrated the existence of exactly @xmath124 mutually complementary observables by an explicit construction in the cases of @xmath27 prime and @xmath125 .",
    "] by @xmath126 .",
    "the property of mutual expansiveness implies that if the system is in an eigenstate of one of the observables , for example , in the eigenstate @xmath127 of the observable @xmath128 and we measure any other observable from the set , say @xmath129 , projecting the system onto states @xmath130 , the individual outcome is completely random ( all measurement results are equally probable ) @xmath131    it was shown in @xcite that the density matrix of the system can fully be reconstructed if one performs a complete set of mutually complementary observations .",
    "this suggest that the total information content of a quantum system represented by a density matrix @xmath97 is _ all _ obtainable from a complete set of mutually complementary measurements . to obtain the total information one",
    "however can not perform the set of measurements successively because , unlike the classical case , the information obtained in successive quantum measurements depends on the order of its acquisition ( see fig .",
    "[ qballs ] and discussion above ) .",
    "instead it seems that any attempt to obtain the total information content of a quantum system has to be related to the complete set of mutually complementary experiments performed on systems that are all in the same quantum state .",
    "we suggest that it is therefore natural to require that the total information content in a system in the case of quantum systems is _ sum _ of the individual amounts of information over a complete set of @xmath66 mutually complementary observables . as already mentioned above , for a spin-1/2 particle",
    "these are three spin projections along orthogonal directions .",
    "if we define the information gain in an individual measurement by the shannon measure the total information encoded in the three spin components is given by @xmath132 here , e.g. @xmath133 is the probabilities to find the particle with spin up along direction @xmath134 .",
    "considering now an explicit example we will show that the total information @xmath94 based on the shannon measure is in general _ not _ invariant under unitary transformations .",
    "we calculate ( [ tic1 ] ) for a spin-1/2 particle in the state @xmath135 and we find that @xmath136 depends on the parameter @xmath137 , thus being not invariant under unitary transformations .",
    "this associates a number of highly counter - intuitive properties to @xmath94 : 1 ) it can be different for states of the same purity ( e.g. it takes its maximal value of 2 bits of information for @xmath138 and it takes its minimal value of 1.36 bits for @xmath139 ) ; 2 ) it changes in time even for a system completely isolated from the environment where no information can be exchanged with environment ; 3 ) it can take different values for different sets of the three orthogonal spin projections .",
    "these unnatural properties we see again as a strong indications for inadequacy of the shannon measure to define the information gain in an individual quantum measurement .",
    "we suggest that it is natural to require that the information content of the quantum system defined as a sum of individual measures over a complete set of mutually complementary measurements is invariant under unitary transformations .",
    "having shown that this can not be achieved with the shannon measure of information we now introduce a new measure of information that differs both mathematically and conceptually from shannon s measure of information and according to which the information content has invariance property .",
    "the new measure of information is a quadratic function of probabilities ) were studied in detail by hardy , littlewood and plya @xcite .",
    "they introduced a general class of mathematical expressions @xmath140 that from the point of view of information theory all can be assumed to quantify information properly .",
    "these expressions are also closely related to tsallis s @xcite nonextensive entropy @xmath141 and rnyi s @xcite entropy @xmath142 @xmath143 and it takes into account that for quantum systems the only features known before an experiment is performed are the probabilities for various events to occur ( see @xcite for discussion ; there a specific normalization factor in expression ( [ junko ] ) was used resulting in maximally @xmath144 bits for @xmath125 possible outcomes ) . the measure @xmath145 takes its maximal value of @xmath146 if one @xmath147 and it takes its minimal value of 0 when all @xmath25 are equal .",
    "the important property of the new measure of information is that the total information defined with respect to it is _ invariant _ under unitary transformations . using eq .",
    "( [ goja ] ) one obtains that the sum over individual measures of information of mutually complementary observations results in @xcite @xmath148 for a system described by the density matrix @xmath97 . here",
    "@xmath149 denotes the probability to observe the @xmath150-th outcome of the @xmath151-th observable .",
    "the total information content of the system therefore might all be encoded in one single observable or , alternatively it might be partially encoded in all @xmath66 mutually complementary observables . for a composite system in a product state",
    "the total information can all be encoded in individual systems constituting the composite system or , alternatively in the extreme case of maximally entangled states it can all be encoded in joint properties of the systems with no information left in individual systems @xcite .",
    "independent of the various possibilities to encode information the total information content of the system can not fundamentally exceed the maximal possible amount of information that can be encoded in an individual observable @xmath152 $ ] .",
    "this upper limit is reached when the system is in the pure state .",
    "when the system is in a completely mixed state the total information takes its minimal value of @xmath1 .",
    "the property of invariance under unitary transformations implies that the total information content of the system does not dependent of the particular set of mutually complementary observables ; it is a characterization of the state of the system alone , not of the specific reference set of complementary observables .",
    "furthermore , since evolution in time is described by a unitary operation the total information of the system is conserved in time if there is no information exchange with the environment .",
    "we would like to note that the total information ( [ ljubav ] ) was used in @xcite to study the transfer of entanglement and information for quantum teleportation of an unknown entangled state through noisy quantum channels . the total information ( [ ljubav ] ) belongs to the set of quantum counterparts of nonextensive entropies finding its application in increasing number of problems in quantum physics , e.g. description and controlling of laser cooling @xcite , a non - extensive approach to the decoherence problem @xcite , description and quantifying of entanglement , and deducing criterions for separability of density matrices @xcite .",
    "in this work we have stressed some conceptual difficulties arising when shannon s notion of information is applied to define information gain in a quantum measurement . in particular",
    "we find that the axiomatic derivation of shannon s measure of information is not applicable in quantum measurements in general .",
    "we also show that the information content of a quantum system defined according to shannon s measure possesses some strongly non - physical properties .",
    "we argue that these difficulties in defining the information gain in quantum measurement by the shannon measure of information arise whenever it is not possible , not even _ in principle _ , to assume that attributes observed are assigned to the quantum system before the observation is performed .    having critized shannon s measure of information as being not appropriate for identifying the information gain in quantum measurement we proposed a new measure of information in quantum mechanics that both mathematically and conceptually differs from shannon s measure of information . while shannon s information is applicable when measurement reveals a preexisting property , the new measure of information takes into account that for quantum systems the only features known before an experiment is performed are the probabilities for various events to occur . in general , which specific event occurs is objectively random .",
    "the total information content of a quantum system defined according to the new measure of information as the sum of the individual measures of information for mutually complementary observations is invariant under unitary transformations .",
    "this implies that the total information content of the system is invariant under transformation from one complete set of complementary variables to another and is conserved in time if there is no information exchange with an environment .",
