    "<S> to solve the discrepancy between the experimental data on the partial widths and lineshapes of the dipion emission of @xmath0 and the theoretical predictions , we suggest that there is an additional contribution , which was not taken into account in previous calculations . noticing that the mass of @xmath0 is above the production threshold of @xmath1 , the contribution of the sequential process @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) may be sizable , and its interference with that from the direct production would be important . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this work is to investigate if a sum of the two contributions with a relative phase indeed reproduces the data . our numerical results on the partial widths and the lineshapes @xmath4 are satisfactorily consistent with the measurements , thus the role of this mechanism is confirmed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , with the parameters obtained by fitting the data of the belle and babar collaborations , we predict the distributions @xmath5 , which have not been measured yet .    the dipion emissions of the bottomonia were observed a long while ago , and as an important channel to investigate the decay mechanism and inner structure of bottomonia , they have undergone careful studies from both theoretical and experimental sides . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the transitions stimulated a series of theoretical efforts @xcite ( see refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a review ) . before @xmath0 joined the game , the transitions occurring among only the bottomonia @xmath6 and @xmath7 were below the @xmath8 threshold @xcite . with @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> being experimentally observed , the situation becomes more intriguing because the @xmath8 channel is open . </S>",
    "<S> it is similar to the case of @xmath9 , which is a charmonium with a mass just above the @xmath10 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the cleo - c collaboration explored the dipion emission of @xmath0 , however , only upper limits for @xmath11 and @xmath12 were obtained @xcite . with the data accumulation of the two @xmath13-factories , more precise measurement on the dipion emission of @xmath0 became possible .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , a great progress on measurements of the @xmath0 dipion transitions has been made @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the belle collaboration reported their observation of @xmath11 @xcite whose partial decay width is @xmath14 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the babar collaboration also presented their measurements on @xmath0 decays into @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite , and the partial widths are respectively @xmath17 kev and @xmath18 kev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides measuring the decay rates of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the belle and babar collaborations also obtained the dipion invariant mass distribution , which is defined as @xmath4 versus @xmath19 and @xmath5 versus @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angle between @xmath0 and @xmath22 in the @xmath23 rest frame .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a comparison between the experimental data and theoretical prediction @xcite on the @xmath19 distributions for @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays was given . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath19 distribution for @xmath11 is close to that predicted in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , whereas the measured lineshape of the @xmath19 distribution for the @xmath12 fully deviates from the prediction of the kuang - yan model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering that the model is completely successful in describing heavy quarkonium transitions @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , one should conclude that there must be some mechanism , which has not been taken into account in the old calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the ratio @xmath27 was given by the babar collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generally speaking , the @xmath15 channel possesses a larger phase space than that of @xmath16 , and it should result in a ratio @xmath28 to be smaller than unity . as a good example , the rule is well satisfied for @xmath6 as the measured @xmath29 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental value of the ratio @xmath30 for @xmath0 obviously declines from the rule , which might also imply existence of some uncounted factors . </S>",
    "<S> the very recent experimental result on the ratio @xmath28 of @xmath31 is given by the belle collaboration as @xmath32 @xcite , which also contradicts to the simple argument . </S>",
    "<S> thus , motivated by these phenomena , one should conjecture that anomalous production rates and lineshapes of @xmath33 are due to the available open @xmath1 channels @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is obviously different from the lower states . </S>",
    "<S> first , the mass of @xmath0 is just above the @xmath8 threshold , so that the coupled channel effect becomes important . </S>",
    "<S> another feature is that @xmath0 predominantly decays into @xmath8 pair because the mode is not suppressed by the ozi rule . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when exploring hidden - bottom decays of @xmath0 , we can not ignore the coupled - channel effect , which may play a crucial role in fact .    in general , </S>",
    "<S> there exist two mechanisms for the dipion emission @xmath34 one is a direct process , where two gluons are successively emitted and eventually hadronized into two pions , which is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ decay ] ( a ) and can be described by the qcd multipole expansion ( qme ) model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> applications of the method have been discussed in all details , thus in this letter , we do not repeat the calculation for the direct transition , but alternatively introduce an effective lagrangian to take care of this contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the transition amplitude of the direct transition @xmath35 can be written as @xmath36_{\\mathrm{direct}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & = { \\mathcal{f}^{(n)}\\over{f_\\pi^2}}\\epsilon_{\\upsilon(5s)}\\cdot \\epsilon_{\\upsilon(ns)}\\big\\{\\big[q^2-\\kappa^{(n)}(\\delta m)^2\\big(1+\\frac{2m^2_\\pi}{q^2}\\big)\\big]_{\\mathrm{s - wave}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad+\\big[\\frac{3}{2}\\kappa^{(n)}\\big((\\delta m)^2-q^2\\big ) \\big(1-\\frac{4m_\\pi^2}{q^2}\\big ) \\big(\\cos\\theta^2-\\frac{1}{3}\\big)\\big]_{\\mathrm{d - wave}}\\big\\ } , \\nonumber\\\\\\label{direct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which was suggested by novikov and shifman in studying @xmath37 @xcite and the subscripts ( s - wave ) and ( d - wave ) denote the s - wave and d - wave contributions respectively . the mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> is expressed as @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 denotes the invariant mass of @xmath23 , while @xmath21 is the angle between @xmath0 and @xmath22 in the @xmath23 rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> the pion decay constant and mass are taken as @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 mev , respectively . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ direct ] ) , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are left as free parameters when fitting the experimental data .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 4s-1s ] , the belle data presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite indicate that a double - peak structure appears in the range of @xmath45 gev , while later measured results given in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite do not show an obvious double - peak structure . </S>",
    "<S> this difference may be caused by different bin widths of the experimental settings of the belle @xcite and babar @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this work we separately fit their different experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> further experimental measurement will test whether there exist this double - peak structure in the dipion invariant mass spectrum of @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we notice that the experimental data of @xmath47 and @xmath48 are quite apart from each other . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis indicates that considering background and intermediate @xmath49 and @xmath50 contributions to @xmath51 , both of the experimental data @xcite can be well met . for @xmath52 process , there exist both background and intermediate @xmath49 contribution , and it is different from the case of @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the interference between background and intermediate @xmath49 contributions reasonably results in a smooth line shape of the distribution of the dipion invariant mass spectrum of @xmath52 .    it is noted that with the parameters obtained by fitting the lineshapes of the belle and babar collaborations on @xmath53 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we predict the angular distribution @xmath54 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . such distributions have not been measure yet , so that the prediction will be tested by the further measurement of the belle group or even a more accurate measurement at the proposed super - b factory .    as aforementioned </S>",
    "<S> there are several puzzles for the dipion emission of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous ratio of @xmath27 ; and the lineshapes @xmath55 can not be explained by the qcd multipole expansion theory , even though the theory works well for obtaining dipion emission rates of lower @xmath56 states . </S>",
    "<S> noticing the mass of @xmath0 is just above the production threshold of @xmath1 channel , it is natural to conjecture that on - shell @xmath1 is an intermediate state and the sequential process @xmath2 may play a crucial role . </S>",
    "<S> namely this sequential process may have a sizable amplitude and interfere with the direct dipion emission from @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of the the two contributions ( the two amplitude may have a relative phase , which is fixed by fitting data in this work ) indeed results in a satisfactory explanation to the data . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , one can note that our model satisfactorily reproduce the lineshapes given by experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) , our prediction on the angular distribution @xmath54 will be testified by the further measurements of the belle - ii group and/or maybe , the proposed super - b factory .    </S>",
    "<S> this result confirms our conjecture that the long - distance effect , which can be treated as a final state interaction indeed plays a crucial role . basically the direct dipion emission occurs via the ozi suppressed process , whereas </S>",
    "<S> , the open - bottom process @xmath57 does not suffer from the suppression . </S>",
    "<S> thus even though the final state interaction is realized via hadronic loops , its amplitude may be comparable with the ozi suppressed direct dipion emission , so that the interference is important . for lower @xmath38 @xmath58 , @xmath1 can not be on - shell , the absorptive part of the hadronic loop does not exist and the contribution may be negligible .    as a conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the puzzles of the dipion emission of @xmath0 can be satisfactorily removed by taking into account the final state interactions . </S>"
