    "in paper @xcite we have proposed a method for distinguishing the charges of leptoquarks collisions is considered . ] ( lq ) produced in the reaction @xmath1 the idea is based on the radiative amplitude zero ( raz ) effect , i.e. the absence of photon emission at some directions depending on the leptoquark electric charges . in this paper we give a detailed numerical analysis of this method applying it to hera and possible lep+lhc experiments .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have derived the analytical formulas for the unpolarized cross sections of the hard subprocesses @xmath2 we have shown that they are proportional to a factor @xmath3 .",
    "so , at some photon emission angles where this factor vanishes the cross sections have exact zeros whose positions are completely determined by the electron ( positron ) and quark charges , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .    of course in reality the leptoquarks decay into two fermions .",
    "considering the electron decay channel we have got the following clear signature : the hard photon , the electron ( or positron ) and a hard ( quark ) jet with complete kinematical reconstruction of the subprocess : @xmath6    in this paper we analyse numerically the manifestations of the raz effect for the case of this three - body final state subprocess .",
    "we make some quantitative conclusions on a possibility to distinguish the charges of leptoquarks produced in @xmath0 collisions taking account of the proton structure functions .",
    "our calculations were made with the help of the comphep package @xcite created for automatic calculation of cross sections at tree level in the standard model and beyond .",
    "for the numerical integration over three - particle phase space and for event generation we have used the bases package @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of subprocess @xmath7 is represented by the feynman diagrams displayed in figs . 1 , 2 . in fig .",
    "1 the diagrams corresponding to the signal lq production process ( 2 ) are represented .",
    "the diagrams of fig . 2 correspond to the sm contribution : deep inelastic scattering associated with hard photon emission .    using the comphep package we have calculated analytically the unpolarized squared matrix elements for subprocesses ( [ eq : iiii ] ) .",
    "but in contrast to our previous paper @xcite we have introduced finite widths into the lq propagators .",
    "then we have evaluated numerically the contribution of separate ( quark ) constituents to the integrated cross sections by the convolution of the subprocess cross section with the corresponding parton distribution function : @xmath8    here @xmath9 is the element of 3-body phase space ; @xmath10 is the cross section of subprocess ( [ eq : iiii ] ) ; @xmath11 is the squared cms energy of the electron - proton system ; the squared cms energy of the hard subprocess equals @xmath12 ; the quark distribution function is denoted by @xmath13 and the 4-momentum transfer scale is taken to be @xmath14 .",
    "the photon emission angle is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "the direction @xmath16 is along the proton beam .",
    "as the lower bound @xmath17 we use the value @xmath18 to take into account the quasi - resonant peak , where @xmath19 is the lq mass .",
    "the function @xmath20 corresponds to the kinematical cuts which we impose to get a realistic distribution and values of cross sections . in particular",
    "this function has to include cuts on the photon energy and on the angles between the photon and all charged particles in ( 2 ) to remove infrared and collinear divergences .",
    "it is also necessary to apply cuts for a reliable separation of the hard jet .",
    "all the fermion masses are put equal to zero in our calculations .",
    "the numerical analysis of the corresponding cross sections is given for two cases :    * hera : @xmath21 , electron beam energy @xmath22 , integrated luminosity @xmath23 ; * lep+lhc : @xmath24 , @xmath25 gev , annual integrated luminosity @xmath26 .",
    "one of the general restrictions on the lq - fermion interaction is the chirality of the fermion - lq coupling ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore we consider only either couplings with left - handed leptons or with right - handed ones . in both cases we use in the numerical analysis",
    "an `` electroweak '' value for this constant , @xmath27 .    as to lq mass we analyse cross sections in the following ranges    * hera : @xmath28 ; * lep+lhc : @xmath29 .    for the parton densities we used the parametrizations steq2p @xcite and mrs - a @xcite , which take account of recent hera data .",
    "both parametrizations gave the same results within calculation error .",
    "let us describe in more detail the cuts which we apply in the laboratory frame .    for a proper background analysis",
    "we introduce kinematical cuts for this reaction in such a way as to suppress contributions from the standard model feynman diagrams ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . recall that for the problem under consideration the lq mass is supposed to be already known from resonant lq production .",
    "so we can introduce a narrow cut on the invariant mass of the outgoing electron ( or positron ) and the ( quark ) jet : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the lq width .",
    "we have calculated @xmath31 at tree level for each value of the lq mass .",
    "we introduce also a cut on the angle between the outgoing electron ( positron ) and the quark : @xmath32 . in the case of lq decay",
    "the products are moving back - to - back in the lq rest frame , so this cut suppresses the standard model contributions and does not change the lq signal .",
    "then we have to introduce cuts on the energies and emission angles of the outgoing electron ( positron ) and quark to exclude the forward and backward cones and various soft contributions : @xmath33    we also apply cuts on the photon energy and emission angle : @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "finally we introduce cuts on the angles between the outgoing photon and the electron ( positron ) and quark : @xmath36 . these cuts remove the collinear divergences .    for this set of cuts and with @xmath37",
    "the cross sections of reaction ( [ eq : iiii ] ) calculated in the standard model are :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "* feynman diagrams with lq signal . * feynman diagrams for subprocesses @xmath38 in sm .",
    "* distributions in @xmath39 for @xmath40 with the @xmath41 leptoquark contribution .",
    "these distributions are obtained at @xmath42 for hera ( @xmath43 ) and at @xmath44 for lep+lhc ( @xmath45 ) with kinematical cuts applied . * cross sections in dependence on the lq mass at hera . * cross sections in dependence on the lq mass at lep+lhc .",
