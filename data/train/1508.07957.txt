    "the spin physics of semiconductors has been developed for bulk materials and demonstrated a wide variety of linear and nonlinear phenomena , realized thanks to the optical orientation  @xcite .",
    "it has been reborn in semiconductor nanostructures in recent decades  @xcite .",
    "a significant part of the spin - related phenomena are underlain on the dynamic spin polarization of the nuclear spins being polarized by means of the transfer of the photon angular momentum to the nuclear - spin system via electron - nuclear hyperfine interaction  @xcite .",
    "the achievement of a high polarization of the nuclear - spin system becomes challenging for quantum dot ( qd ) systems where a single spin of an electron would be strongly localized@xcite and is under the influence of the nuclear spin fluctuations paving the way to a fast carrier - spin relaxation  @xcite . in spite of a combination of a large variety of methods tried to be used for reaching a sufficiently high degree of nuclear - spin order  @xcite , the experimental achievement of the spin polarization , close to hundred percent , is still a challenging problem , limited , in some particular cases , by the quantum nature of the spin system  @xcite . a further microscopic analysis including a combination of experimental methods like nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr )  @xcite and/or various spin noise measurements  @xcite in combination with atomistic modeling  @xcite",
    "are highly required to gain insight into such an intriguing problem .    in self - assembled qds ,",
    "@xmath0 nuclear spins interact with the localized - electron spin with different strengths because of a spread of the electron density .",
    "however , an additional spread of the interaction exists even at nuclear - spin level due to the crystal lattice deformation caused by built - in strain .",
    "this introduces a non - homogeneous nuclear quadrupole interaction , changing the usual nuclear - spin dynamics  @xcite but also modifying the nmr spectrum both in the single qds  @xcite and in the qd ensembles  @xcite .",
    "the microscopic analysis of the quadrupole interaction is a rather complex problem while any direct experimental measurement of its magnitude would hardly be realized in practice .",
    "since only scant experimental progress can be expected thereupon , an atomistic analysis would at least give some microscopic information within the framework of a chosen model  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we address the investigation of the structural properties of a  single qd with respect to the analysis of nuclear quadrupole interaction .",
    "we make use of the high - angle annular dark - field ( haadf ) imaging of an individual self - assembled qd in a scanning transmission electron microscope ( stem ) .",
    "this allows us to resolve a crystal lattice with atomic - column resolution that can be used to determine the shape and chemical composition of the qd .",
    "the investigated sample is a heterostructure grown by molecular - beam epitaxy on a gaas substrate and contains 20 layers of ( in , ga)as qds , embedded in a gaas matrix .",
    "the post - growth thermal annealing of the structure allows for activation of in - diffusion of ga atoms inside the qd that reduces the number of structure defects and , in addition , blue  shifts the ground - state excitonic transition  @xcite .",
    "the obtained stem images were post - processed with geometric phase analysis ( gpa ) , from which the cauchy - green strain tensor components are extracted .",
    "in addition , to obtain the profile of the in and ga concentrations inside the qd , the local chemical composition is determined by means of atomically resolved haadf - stem and energy - dispersive x - ray ( edx ) spectroscopy .",
    "these data were then used to reconstruct the distribution of the strain - induced electric - field gradients ( efg ) causing the nuclear quadrupole interaction .",
    "further calculations allow the interpretation of the nmr transitions that can be detected in the ensemble of such qds  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : microscopy ] , we present the details of the microscopic study",
    ". the results of the postprocessing of the microscopic images are discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quadrupole ] , we discuss the possibility of application of microscopic methods for an analysis of strain - induced nuclear quadrupole interaction and quantitative modelling of the nmr spectra .",
    "the main results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to obtain the crystal strain and , correspondingly , the quadrupole interaction , high - quality microscopic imaging is required  @xcite . in particular , the image should include the investigated qd and a region of the surrounding gaas matrix of much larger area than the size of the qd .",
    "this region is used as a bulk reference area for further analysis .",
    "selection of the appropriate microscopy method is based on the ability to resolve the atomic columns of the crystal and the ability to extract the chemical composition of the qd .",
    "such data are obtained by analysing the heterostructure with stem using haadf - detector , providing information about the concentration of the atoms of different species  @xcite .",
    "the cross - sectional specimens of the sample with an area of about @xmath1  @xmath2 are prepared by mechanical cutting of the heterostructure in the @xmath3 crystallographic plane and then glueing to a tripod holder .",
    "the specimens are then mechanically polished reducing the thickness of the sample down to @xmath41030  m. further ion etching of the qd containing region is applied using a gatan precision ion polishing system ( pips ) until a hole is etched into the sample . at the edge of this hole",
    "the sample thickness is clearly below 200  nm and thus transparent for electrons .",
    "the experiments are performed with an fei titan 80/300 microscope operated at 300  kv electron - beam acceleration voltage and equipped with an image - aberration corrector , edx , and haadf detectors . the overview image of the structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qdlayers ] , from which multiple qds placed on several wetting layers are resolvable . size and shape of the dots are found to be weakly dispersed , which is also confirmed by a relatively narrow linewidth of the ground - state photoluminescence studied previously with these qds  @xcite .",
    "a few randomly chosen single qds are analyzed .    .",
    "atomic - column resolution is demonstrated in the inset . ]",
    "consequently , the high - resolution haadf - stem images were recorded in the qd - containing region of the sample .",
    "the image size is selected to approximately @xmath5 and the spatial resolution of the microscope is around 0.12  nm in the scanning mode .",
    "each image contains one qd plus a sufficient amount of the surrounding gaas matrix , which can be used as reference material for thickness measurement .",
    "as high resolution was obtained in the haadf - stem images , they were not only suitable for atomic z - contrast evaluation  @xcite but could be also used for geometric phase analysis  @xcite .",
    "the chemically sensitive image contrast of the haadf - stem images ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qdstem ] ) is due to the used haadf - detector .",
    "this ring - shaped detector detects only electrons that are scattered into high - angles ( 36220  mrads for the camera length used in this work ) .",
    "the amount of electrons scattered into this region strongly depends on the nuclear charges of the scattering specimen atoms .",
    "the following evaluation procedure was performed for every single image in order to obtain the chemical composition .",
    "first , all atomic columns in the high - resolution image were identified . to this end",
    ", a wiener filter has been applied on the original image  @xcite .",
    "after that , the image has been divided into `` voronoi''-cells and the mean intensity has been calculated for each `` voronoi''-cell and has been assigned to the corresponding atomic column .",
    "note that in this step the intensities of the original unfiltered image were used . to allow for the quantitative comparison to simulated data ,",
    "the mean intensity values were normalized with respect to the intensity of the scanning electron probe . in the following step ,",
    "the normalized intensities were compared to reference data from multislice simulations in the frozen lattice approach using the stemsim program @xcite carried out in dependence of sample thickness and indium fraction . for more details on the simulations we refer the reader to ref .  .",
    "finally , the sample thickness was evaluated from the gaas region and interpolated over the qd to allow for the determination of the indium concentration as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qdconcentration ] .     reaching the maximum value @xmath6 in the center of the qd . ]    to verify the accuracy of haadf - stem , edx spectroscopy is used .",
    "the edx spectra were also acquired in haadf - stem mode .",
    "while the beam is centred on a small region of the sample surface , the x - ray counts were integrated over one minute .",
    "both methods of the z - contrast evaluation show very similar values for the maximum concentration of indium in the single qd , i.e. , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for edx and haadf - stem , respectively",
    ".    several methods for mapping the crystal - lattice strain can be applied  @xcite . in the electron microscope ,",
    "none of them is able to evaluate the strain - tensor component along the electron - beam propagation direction .",
    "however , the two - dimensional maps of two diagonal strain - tensor components could be extracted .",
    "for further analysis , the component of shear strain is also required . denoting the cartesian coordinate system with respect to crystallographic axes so that @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] , the cauchy - green strain - tensor components @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are obtained .",
    "while other components are experimentally unaccessible , the symmetry of the problem allows us to equalize the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions , keeping in mind that the specimen is several times thicker than the qd lateral size .",
    "we take @xmath16 and @xmath17 keeping @xmath18 . while @xmath18 is a reasonable assumption",
    "since it is large at the heteroboundary , which is unsharp in the annealed qds , other assumptions emerge as a value judgement .",
    "note , that in ( in , ga)as / gaas qds , there is a small inequivalence of @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] directions revealing in the exciton fine - structure splitting  @xcite that can be changed in strained qds , as advanced atomistic modeling shows  @xcite .",
    "the strain mapping is performed by means of two methods , the geometric - phase analysis ( gpa )  @xcite and a modified peak - pair analysis ( ppa )  @xcite for verification .",
    "the gpa allows us to extract the crystal - lattice distortions locally at each atomic column with respect to the unstrained lattice area .",
    "the basic idea of such an analysis is based on the fast fourier transform of the real - space image into the reciprocal space .",
    "local strain tensor components , symmetric and rotation parts of distortion are calculated by derivation of the displacement obtained from two non - collinear fourier components  @xcite .",
    "the phase component of this function , called the geometric phase , describes the position - dependent lattice deviation with respect to a reference .",
    "the reference area of the crystal lattice is taken in the barrier region @xmath21  nm away of the qd where the in concentration is negligibly small .",
    "the gpa strain - tensor components are extracted as @xmath22 where @xmath23 $ ] is the matrix formed by the components of two non - collinear reflexes @xmath24 and @xmath25 , each of which is connected with the position - dependent geometric phase , @xmath26 , as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 represents the periodicities corresponding to the bragg reflections .",
    "it has the following relationship with the lattices fringe spacing : @xmath29 .",
    "additionally , the same stem image with a single qd is processed using the ppa .",
    "in contrast to the gpa , the ppa is a real space procedure for strain mapping .",
    "ppa works with images having well - resolved fringe patterns , finding pairs of peaks along a preselected direction and distance in the affine transformed space defined by a pair of basis vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "when the reference vectors are chosen on the filtered image , they can be used to construct an affine transformation . the next step in the ppa",
    "is the identification of peak - pairs using the chosen basis vectors and the intensity maxima set in the image .",
    "the cauchy - green strain components can be calculated by solving the following set of linear equations    [ eq : ppastrain ] @xmath32    with coordinates of the displacements @xmath33 and @xmath34 with respect to the reference vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the methods described above are based on the same general assumption that the relation between the atomic column positions in real crystal and features in the stem image is constant inside the studied region , where the phase shift between maxima and atoms is supposed to be constant .",
    "both of these two methods , within the calculation error , gave identical results for all three tensor components @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 for the single qds under study . the ppa requires less amount of memory and calculation time , given that the two - dimensional complex fourier transform is not required .",
    "on the other hand , ppa fails when lattice peaks are not easily detected due to lower resolution of the image and appearance of sublattices due to a structure defect .",
    "in this case , filtering of the original image can be performed .",
    "summarizing , we consider that both algorithms , gpa and ppa are useful for strain mapping , each having different advantages and limitations , and should be considered in each particular case specifically . in this work ,",
    "we present the results of gpa only .",
    "in general , the strain is measured with respect to the bulk lattice parameters of the material .",
    "following this definition , the gpa(ppa ) strain is connected with the material strain , @xmath37 , as follows @xmath38 here , the position - dependent lattice constant is determined by taking into account the concentration dependence of the solid compound via vegard s law , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the position - dependent in concentration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qdconcentration ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : qdstrain ] illustrates the components of the physical strain , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 evaluated from gpa analysis .",
    "the strain - tensor components extracted from high - resolution stem images are averaged over the sample thickness , i.e. , their values in the qd would be slightly larger in magnitude .",
    "note , that an additional source of strain release arises from the sample thinning down to less than a m. in this case , the qd becomes closer to a surface than a deep - in - bulk qd .",
    "therefore , both these effects should be considered as a source of measurement error for further evaluation of the results .",
    "the negative value of @xmath11 shows that the crystal lattice is compressed in @xmath14 direction ( @xmath19 $ ] ) [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : qdstrain ] ( a ) ] . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath12 component is mostly positive in the upper left region of the qd ( see fig . [",
    "fig : qdstrain ] ( b ) ) , i.e. , there is a stretching of the lattice in the growth direction @xmath41 ( @xmath42 $ ] ) .",
    "[ fig : qdstrain](c ) shows a shear - strain @xmath13 , which is present in a relatively small area having a mostly positive value and some periodicity in its distribution . in the wetting layer ,",
    "the values of shear strain are predominantly negative , while inside the qds this deformation is positive .",
    "overall , the obtained results qualitatively well coincide with the finite - element modelling , represented previously in ref .  .    .",
    "black lines indicate the shape of the qd extracted from the ( in , ga)as alloy concentration map . ]",
    "the change of energy experienced by the nuclear spin @xmath43 can be dependent of nuclear orientation .",
    "the charge environment of the nuclei interacts with the external electric potential @xmath44 . in the equilibrium ,",
    "the nuclei experience zero average electric field but nuclei having @xmath45 have also nonzero quadrupole moment interacting with the efg denoted hereafter as @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of nonzero @xmath46 is any inhomogeneity of the electric fields .",
    "the strongest effect is caused by the substitutional atoms in the alloy .",
    "due to different electronegativity of the cation atoms , the anion as nuclei are highly affected by the efg caused by the charge environment redistribution .",
    "for example , 5% electronegativity difference between the group - iii atoms leads to the nuclear - spin splitting of several tens of mhz , as shown in ( al , ga)as bulk  @xcite .    in self - assembled qds , a weaker splitting",
    "would be obtained due to the crystal - lattice biaxial strain of several percent , leading to the quadrupole splitting of nuclear - spin states of the order of a mhz  @xcite . even in the absence of both effects",
    ", a strong electron localization would lead to the additional inhomogeneity of spin splitting caused by interaction with the applied electric field @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "our estimation shows , however , that the efg variation due to inhomogeneity of the ground - state electron density inside the model qd leads to , at least , an order of magnitude smaller variation of spin splitting than its strain - induced value .",
    "however , in electrically driven qds or in self - assembled qds with a bias - controlled charge state , the electric - field induced efg variation requires additional verification , as shown previously in a quantum well system  @xcite .",
    "considering further the strain - induced quadrupole interaction , the hamiltonian reads as @xmath47 here , the first term couples nuclear spin @xmath48 of the @xmath49th nucleus having the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath50 with the external magnetic field @xmath51 .",
    "the second term describes the nuclear quadrupole interaction with strength @xmath52 .",
    "the coordinate system @xmath53 corresponds to the major frame of the efg acting on the nucleus generally not coinciding with the @xmath54 frame of the crystal .",
    "the quadrupole frequency @xmath55 is proportional to the major efg component @xmath56 satisfying @xmath57 .",
    "the quadrupole asymmetry parameter , @xmath58 , is determined by the relative ratio of its other principal components .",
    "the microscopic analysis allows to quantitatively evaluate the efg tensor and , as a consequence , to map the quadrupole interaction over the sketch of the qd .",
    "the efg tensor relates to the elastic strain as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the fourth - rank gradient elastic tensor  @xcite . using the strain - tensor components extracted from haadf - stem analysis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qdstrain ] ) , we calculate all non - zero components of @xmath46 , and , correspondingly @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the nuclear quadrupole moment .",

    "[ fig : qdquadrupole ] .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath55 varies by the order of magnitude over the qd volume",
