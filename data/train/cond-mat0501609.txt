    "since the discovery of giant magnetoresistance in metallic multilayers there has been considerable interest in studying electronic transport in layered materials.@xcite at the same time , experimental control of the lateral scale has enabled studies of electronic transport in quantum wires of atomic dimensions.@xcite because of the small dimensions involved , the transport properties of both of these systems should be understood on the basis of their atomic structure .",
    "this perception has generated a large effort in recent years to calculate the conductance of multilayers and quantum wires from first principles .",

    "the conductance @xmath1 is expressed as a quantum mechanical scattering problem@xcite and can be simply related to the total transmission probability at the fermi energy , @xmath2 , as @xmath3 the multilayer or quantum wire is generally considered as a scattering region of finite size , sandwiched between two semi - infinite ballistic wires . aiming at a materials specific description , most current approaches treat the electronic structure within the framework of density functional theory ( dft).@xcite    frequently the conductance is calculated using a green function expression first derived by caroli _",
    "et al._@xcite an alternative technique , suitable for hamiltonians that can be represented in tight - binding form , has been formulated by ando.@xcite it is based upon directly matching the wave function in the scattering region to the bloch modes of the leads . the latter technique has been applied to conductance calculations at the empirical tight - binding level , @xcite as well as on the first - principles dft level .",
    "@xcite the relationship between the mode matching@xcite and green function @xcite approaches is not immediately obvious .",
    "indeed , it was recently stated that ando s approach is incomplete and does not yield the correct expression for the conductance .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we demonstrate that the two approaches are completely equivalent . in the green function approach , a small imaginary part must be added to or subtracted from the energy in order to distinguish between the retarded and advanced forms.@xcite in mode matching , scattering wave functions are calculated that incorporate the retarded or advanced boundary conditions directly .",
    "this makes it possible to solve the scattering problem also at real , instead of complex energies .",
