    "the advances in computational and biological techniques of protein studies have yielded enormous online databases .",
    "however , the complexity of protein structure requires adequate bioinformatics methods to mine these databases .",
    "the principles of graph theory have been adopted to investigate organic molecules @xcite and proteins @xcite .",
    "the tertiary structure captures homology between proteins that are distantly related in evolution . with the availability of more protein 3d - structures due to techniques such as x - ray crystallography ,",
    "increasing efforts have been devoted to directly deal with them .",
    "a crucial step in the computational study of protein structures is to look for a convenient representation of their spatial conformations .",
    "the pdb format @xcite represents the standard computer analyzable format that is used in online databases for representing macromolecular structures .",
    "extensions of the pdb format have been proposed in the literature mainly mmcif and pdbml / xml file formats @xcite .",
    "the pdb format and its extensions mainly consist on spatial coordinates of atoms composing the considered macromolecule besides its biological description and experimental details with which it was obtained .",
    "such representation prevent a direct use of the large repertoire of available data mining and graph theory tools to study protein structures .",
    "a possible representation of protein 3d - structure can be a graph of interconnected amino acids .",
    "figure [ fig : protein_to_graph ] shows a real world example of the human hemoglobin protein and its corresponding graph .",
    "the graph representation preserves the overall structure and its components .",
    "such representation can be considered as an alternative to existent representations , such as the pdb format @xcite .",
    "it allows to fully exploit the potential of data mining and graph theory algorithms to perform complex studies such as the discovery of important substructures in protein families which can be performed through frequent subgraph mining , pattern recognition , and functional motif discovery .",
    "figure [ fig : motif ] shows a real example of two subgraphs corresponding to two recurrent substructures in a dataset of 38 proteins from the immunoglobin c1-set domains family , and their corresponding mapping on the original 3d - structure of the hfe(human ) hemochromatosis protein .",
    "such substructures are relevant for protein classification , protein function prediction , protein folding , @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , we have previously explored the potential of graph representation in the classification of four protein 3d - structure datasets , including g - proteins , immunoglobin c1-set domains , c - type lectin domains , and protein kinases catalytic subunit @xcite .",
    "frequent subgraphs were mined and used as features for the classification of each dataset .",
    "the experimental results showed that this graph - based approach outperformed the most competitive bioinformatics approaches including structural alignment - based classification ( using dali @xcite ) and blast - based classification @xcite . in this paper , we present _ protein graph repository _ ( pgr ) , an online repository of graphs representing all protein 3d - structures of the _ protein data bank _ ( pdb)@xcite .",
    "pgr provides bioinformatics tools that facilitate the integration of graph theory techniques in the core of protein 3d - structure studies @xcite .",
    "chemical interactions are the electrostatic forces that hold atoms and residues together , stabilizing proteins and forming molecules that give them their 3 dimensional shape @xcite .",
    "these interactions are mainly :    * covalent bonds between two atoms sharing a pair of valence electrons , * ionic bonds of electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged components , * hydrogen bonds between two partially negatively charged atoms sharing a partially positively charged hydrogen , * hydrophobic interactions where hydrophobic amino acids in the protein closely associate their side chains together , * van der waals forces which represent transient and weak electrical attraction of one atom for another when electrons are fluctuating .",
    "these interactions are supposed to be , in one form or another , the chemical analogues of the graph edges .",
    "existing transformation approaches of protein 3d - structure into graph , similarly consider amino acids as graph nodes , but they differ in considering the edges in attempt to reflect the truly existing interactions . in the following , we present the main approaches in the literature that are used for building protein graphs in pgr .",
    "let @xmath1 be a graph , @xmath2 and @xmath3 two nodes of @xmath1 ( @xmath2,@xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath1 ) , @xmath5 a function that computes the distance between pairs of nodes @xmath6 , and @xmath7 a distance threshold .",

    "the main atom used in the literature is _ @xmath11 _ with usually @xmath12 _ _ on the argument that @xmath11 atoms define the overall shape of the protein conformation @xcite . * * all atoms * considers the distances between all pairs of atoms @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents all atoms of @xmath2 ( @xmath15)@xcite . two nodes representing two amino acids @xmath2 and @xmath3 are linked by an edge @xmath9 if the euclidean distance between any pair of atoms from both amino acids @xmath13 is below a distance threshold @xmath7 .",

    "regarding the graph transformation of protein 3d structures , both main atom and all atoms suffer drawbacks .",
    "since , the main atom technique abstracts amino acids into one main atom , it may omit possible edges between other atoms in the amino acids that are more close than their main atoms .",
    "moreover , in the case of considering centroids of the amino acids as the main atoms , it may also suffer from two problems . in the case of two big amino acids ,",
    "if their centroids are farther than the given distance threshold , they will be considered with no links while a real connection could be established between other close atoms ( other than the centroids ) . in the case of small amino acids , if the distance between their centroids is smaller than the given distance threshold then they will be considered as connected while they can be disconnected in reality .",
    "the all atoms technique overcomes both limitations by theoretically considering the distance between all the atoms in the amino acids , this highly increases the runtime and complexity of the technique . however , the authors proposed some heuristics to alleviate the complexity .",
    "for instance , they consider only the distance between the side chains centroids to decide whether their amino acids are connected or not , without regards to their chemical properties .",
    "this reduces the runtime but it may engender false edges .    compared to the conventional distance matrix representation @xcite _ pg - similarity _ measures the global structural and topological similarity between protein structures on a macro side , whereas distance matrix based similarity operates on a micro side and looks into every single detail in compared structures .",
    "even though both similarity methods should be highly correlated and not diverge ( as similar structures have similar topological descriptions ) , each method has its positive and negative sides .",
    "distance matrix based methods has the advantage of detecting exact superposition and local matching sites , however , they are combinatorial and thus computationally costly .",
    "pg - similarity method is based on a vector embedding of graphs of protein structures based on a set of structural and topological attributes .",
    "this makes it unable to return local matches , however , such strategy makes it able to capture structural similarity in a very fast way .",
    "moreover , some attributes , like clustering coefficient and neighborhood impurity , makes pg - similarity able to reveal hidden similarities that are undetected using existing methods .    with the growth of protein 3d - structures in online databases ,",
    "the transformation of protein 3d - structures into graphs of interconnected amino acids and the application of graph mining concepts constitute a relevant feature for the development of rapid and efficient computational techniques .",
