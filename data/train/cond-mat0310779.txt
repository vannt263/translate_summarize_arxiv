    "one remarkable feature of critical phenomena is the concept of universality , that means , the fact that critical exponents are independent of the particular type of lattice and of nature of the physical system . transitions in systems so diverse as gases , magnets or metalic alloys , can be characterized by the same critical indices . in some sense",
    "this can be explained as a consequence of the equivalence of the local simmetry of these different systems @xcite .",
    "non universal behavior is a rare event observed only in special situations and non trivial models .    in magnetic systems the critical exponents , in general ,",
    "depend only on the dimension of the space and on the dimension of the spins .",
    "the variation of critical exponents for fixed dimension of the lattice and fixed dimension of the spin is found in non trivial cases in which there is some types of competing interactions , frustration or symmetry breaking .    in this work",
    "we report results obtained for a complex model which is universal with respect to some exponents but that shows non - universality with respect to the correlation length exponent @xmath2 .",
    "we deal with percolation phenomena in a multifractal support immersed in a 2d space .",
    "it has been shown that percolation corresponds to the @xmath3 state of potts model @xcite . in this perspective",
    "we expect universal behavior for percolation in @xmath4 dimensions , for any kind of lattice .",
    "the multifractal support we have proposed has a new local lattice structure : the local connectivity and the local anisotropy vary from region to region .",
    "the strength of the anisotropy change of the multifractal support is related to a single parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 of the critical percolation cluster varies with @xmath5 showing an accentuated sensibility to the local anisotropy of the support structure . on the other side ,",
    "the percolation cluster is a fractal with a fractal dimension , @xmath1 , that is identical to the one of the standard percolation cluster .",
    "the same occurs with the critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "that means , if we take into consideration only @xmath1 and @xmath0 we could say that the universality class holds for this problem .",
    "a motivation for this work also comes from the problem of direct percolation in which the anisotropy of the model is responsible for anisotropic clusters and for different correlation lengths in parallel and perpendicular directions . in this work",
    "we observe the build up of percolation clusters that are very elongated for small values of @xmath5 , showing anisotropic structures .",
    "do these local anisotropic properties affect the critical exponents ?    in the reference",
    "@xcite an object , @xmath6 , is developed to study percolation in multifractal systems .",
    "this object is a natural generalization of the square lattice in which it is possible to estimate analytically the full spectrum of fractal dimensions .",
    "besides it exhibits a rich distribution of area among the blocks and a non - trivial topology , the number of neighbors varies along the object .",
    "moreover its geometric qualities and algorithmic simplicity , it is straightforward to study the percolating properties of @xmath6 .    in a previous work @xcite",
    "we have introduced the multifractal , analytically determined its spectrum of fractal dimensions , analyzed some properties of the histogram of percolating lattices versus occupation probability , and estimated the fractal dimension of the percolation cluster for several parameters of @xmath6 . in a further work @xcite",
    "we have performed a comprehensive study of the determination of the percolation threshold , @xmath7 .",
    "in particular we have explored the relation between @xmath7 and the topologic properties of @xmath6 . in this work",
    "we deal with the problem of the class of universality of @xmath6 and its relation with symmetry characterization .",
    "the multifractal object we develop , @xmath6 , is an intuitive generalization of the square lattice .",
    "suppose that in the construction of the square lattice we use the following algorithm : take a square of size @xmath8 and cut it symmetrically with vertical and horizontal lines .",
    "repeat this process @xmath9-times ; at the @xmath10 step we have a regular lattice with @xmath11 cells .",
    "the setup algorithm of @xmath6 is quite similar , the main difference is that we do not cut the square in a symmetric way . in the next section",
    "we explain in detail this algorithm .",
    "in this section we present the multifractal object @xmath6 in a double perspective .",
    "initially we introduce the object @xmath6 using its growing algorithm . in a second moment",
    "we show how percolation properties are studied in such a non - trivial system .",
    "we start with a square of linear size @xmath8 and a parameter @xmath12 , for integers @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the first step , @xmath15 , consists of two sections of the square : a vertical and an horizontal .",
    "initially the square is cut in two pieces of area @xmath16 and @xmath17 by a vertical line ( we use @xmath18 area units ) .",
    "this process is shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) , where we use @xmath19 .",
    "the horizontal cut is shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "note that we use the same @xmath5 .",
    "the first partition of the square generates four rectangular blocks : the largest one of area @xmath20 , two of area @xmath21 and the smallest one of area @xmath22 .",
    "the second step , @xmath23 , is shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the same process of vertical and horizontal sections is repeated as in step @xmath24 inside each block . in this way",
    "@xmath6 is a self - affine object .",
    "as observed in the figure at end of step @xmath23 there are @xmath25 blocks .",
    "generically we have after the @xmath10-step @xmath26 blocks .",
    "the partition process produces a set of blocks with a variety of areas .",
    "we call a set of all elements with the same area as a @xmath27-set . in the case @xmath23",
    "there are five @xmath27-sets .    at the @xmath10-step of the algorithm",
    ", the partition of the area @xmath28 of the square in @xmath18 units follows the binomial rule : @xmath29 the number of elements of a @xmath27-set is @xmath30 .",
    "in reference @xcite we see that as @xmath31 each @xmath27-set determines a monofractal whose dimension is @xmath32 . in the same limit @xmath31",
    "the ensemble of all @xmath27-sets engenders the actual multifractal @xmath6 .    in figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) we show @xmath6 , as in figure [ fig1 ] ( @xmath33 ) , for @xmath34 .",
    "we use the following code color : blocks of equal area ( same @xmath27-set ) share the same color .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ( b ) is a zoom of the inner square part of [ fig2 ] ( a )",
    ". we can observe in this picture that it shows a slight anisotropy compared with the square lattice .",
    "the anisotropy in the figure is not very accentuated because @xmath33 is close to the square lattice case , @xmath35 .    in the construction process of @xmath6",
    "we see that as @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) the blocks became more stretched in one direction than other . in this way",
    "@xmath5 is a measure of the stretching of the blocks .",
    "this property will reflect in the anisotropy of the percolation cluster as we shall see in the simulations .",
    "the main subject of this work is the study of the percolation properties of @xmath6 . to perform such a task we develop a percolation algorithm .",
    "the percolation algorithm of @xmath6 starts mapping this object into the square lattice .",
    "the square lattice should be large enough that each line segment of @xmath38 coincides with a line of the lattice , this condition imposes that @xmath5 is a rational number . in this way all blocks of the multifractal are composed by a finite number of cells of the square lattice . to explain the percolation algorithm we suppose that @xmath6 construction is at step @xmath9 .",
    "we proceed the percolation algorithm by choosing at random one among the @xmath26 blocks of @xmath38 independent of its size . once a block is chosen all the cells in the square lattice corresponding to this block are considered occupied . each time",
    "a block of @xmath38 is chosen the algorithm check if the occupied cells at the underlying square lattice are connected in such a way to form an @xmath39 percolation cluster .",
    "the algorithm to check percolation is similar to the one used in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the percolating cluster of @xmath6 for @xmath40 and a particular realization .",
    "others @xmath5 show a similar aspect , but the blocks became more stretched as @xmath37 . in this limit",
    "the multifractal turns more anisotropic .",
    "if we compare this percolating cluster with the percolating cluster of square lattice @xcite we observe a strong anisotropy in the present case .",
    "such anisotropy is observed also in the scaling of the correlation length , @xmath41 , as we see in the next section .",
    "following the literature @xcite we call @xmath42 the density of occupation of a lattice .",
    "@xmath43 is the probability that for a site occupation @xmath42 there exists a contiguous cluster of occupied sites which cross completely the square lattice of size @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath7 is the density of occupation at the percolation threshold .",
    "there are several ways @xcite to define @xmath43 , we use two of them : @xmath44 is the probability that there exits a cluster crossing either the horizontal or the vertical direction , and @xmath45 is the probability that there exits a cluster crossing around both directions . at the limit of infinite lattice size @xmath44 and @xmath45 converge to a common value in the case of the square lattice .",
    "in this section we deal with the estimation of critical exponents and fractal dimensions of @xmath6 . before the numerics we warn to a specific point in this process .",
    "suppose the multifractal construction is at step @xmath9 , the underlying square lattice has the number of cells @xmath11 , and the number of blocks is @xmath46 , values that are independent of @xmath5 .",
    "the size of the underlying lattice , however , is @xmath47 , a function of @xmath5 . because of this point we have to take care in the effect of finite size properties of the multifractal .",
    "a comprehensive study of the percolation threshold , @xmath7 , of @xmath6 is performed in @xcite , we resume this point in the following . the way we find",
    "the best estimative of @xmath7 is to use , for several @xmath8 , the average value of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the results for specific values of @xmath5 are summarized in table @xmath48 .",
    "the results point to a value of @xmath7 which slightly increases with @xmath5 and present a strong discontinuity at @xmath49 ( the square lattice ) .",
    "the estimation of the fractal dimension of the percolating cluster , @xmath1 , is performed using the definition : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass of the percolating cluster and @xmath8 the lattice size .",
    "we use in our simulations values of @xmath8 that correspond to @xmath52 .",
    "the results for several @xmath5 are shown in table @xmath48 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath1 in two dimensions is @xmath53 .",
    "the values obtained are close to @xmath54 of the exact value and are not correlated to @xmath5 . however , this fact is not enough to conclude that @xmath6 is in the same class of universality of two dimensional standard percolation . in the next paragraphs we shall return to this point .",
    "percolation in bidimensional spaces shows critical phenomenon close to the critical point @xmath7 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath0 is defined from the relation :    @xmath55    where @xmath7 is the exact occupation probability value in contrast to @xmath56 which is its finite size value .",
    "the power - law ( [ beta ] ) is verified for @xmath56 obtained either from @xmath44 or @xmath45 . in the first case",
    "the formation of a spanning cluster and the power - law are at @xmath57 .",
    "otherwise , if we use @xmath45 , we have to search for a power - law in the vicinity of the critical value for @xmath58 .",
    "we use in our estimation @xmath59 which shows smaller fluctuations than @xmath45 . as the numerical estimation of @xmath0",
    "is based in equation ( [ beta ] ) , @xmath43 is a key element of the analysis .",
    "for @xmath6 the probability @xmath43 is not a well behaved function of @xmath42 for low @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "actually , @xmath43 can show , depending on @xmath5 , an inflection point at @xmath7 in this regime . in the case where @xmath60 the scaling of @xmath61 recovers the power - law behavior . in this regime",
    "we find the same @xmath0 of two dimension standard spaces , @xmath62 .",
    "we check in our simulations that for @xmath63 , @xmath0 is around @xmath64 of the exact value of standard percolation .",
