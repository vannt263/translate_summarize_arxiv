    "a real or integral flow ( or `` circulation '' ) on an ordinary unsigned graph is a real- or integer - valued function on ( oriented ) edges such that the net inflow to each vertex is zero .",
    "analogously , a _ real flow _ on a signed graph is a real - valued function on ( oriented ) signed edges such that the net inflow to each vertex is zero , and an _ integral flow _ , a concept introduced by bouchet @xcite , is a flow whose values are integers .",
    "the theory of flows on ordinary graphs is the specialization of the signed - graph theory to the case in which all edges are positive .",
    "there are many reasons to be interested in integral flows on graphs ; important ones are their connection to integer programming through network optimization and their relationship to graph structure through the analysis of _ conformally indecomposable flows _ ,",
    "that is , integral flows that can not be decomposed as the sum of two integral flows whose flow values have the same sign on each edge ( both @xmath0 or both @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is well known , and an important observation in the theory of integral network flows , that the indecomposable flows are identical to the _ circuit flows _ , which are flows on circuits of the graphic matroid and which ( in a suitable orientation of the graph ) have value @xmath2 on the edges of a graph circuit ( i.e. , a connected 2-regular subgraph ) and @xmath3 elsewhere .",
    "the extension of the theory of indecomposable integral flows to signed graphs by chen and wang @xcite , carried out by an algorithmic method , led to the remarkable discovery that , besides the anticipated circuit flows , which are already more complicated in signed graphs than in ordinary graphs , there are many `` strange '' indecomposable flows with elaborate self - intersection structure not describable by circuits of the signed graph . chen and wang obtained a classification of indecomposable flows by means of their algorithm .    the present paper , by contrast , has a structural approach .",
    "we characterize indecomposable flows by the method of covering graphs , lifting each vertex and each edge of a signed graph to two vertices and two edges of a double covering graph .",
    "the strange indecomposable flows are regarded as singular phenomena , which we resolve by lifting them ( blowing up repeated vertices and overlapping edges ) to ordinary circuit flows in the covering graph . in comparison to the algorithmic approach in @xcite , the present paper hints at a connection ( at least conceptually ) between graph theory and resolution of singularities through covering spaces , as we think of lifting as a combinatorial analogue of resolution of singularities in algebraic geometry .",
    "we believe this connection may be useful for studying gain graphs @xcite , which are more complicated than signed graphs .",
    "the resolution process leads , via  sesqui - eulerian circle - trees \" ( definition [ cycle - tree - defn ] ) , to the following half - integral conformal decomposition ( see theorem [ half - integer scale decomposition](d ) ) : _ every nonzero integral flow on a signed graph can be conformally decomposed into a half - integral positive linear combination of signed - graphic circuit flows . _",
