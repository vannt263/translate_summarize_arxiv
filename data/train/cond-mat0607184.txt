    "the bogoliubov analysis was carried out by huang and gou   and by ueda  @xcite in the presence of the linear zeeman effect .",

    "the zeeman effects are restricted to those up to the linear order in the magnetic field",

    "if we take the quadratic zeeman term into account , the ground - state phase diagram becomes much richer as shown in ref .",
    "in particular , under a certain range of linear and quadratic zeeman effects , there is a special phase in which the magnetization tilts against the applied magnetic field .",
    "the investigation of some of the unique features of this phase is the primary purpose of our study .",
    "when a weak magnetic field is applied along the quantization axis , the @xmath2 or @xmath3 state is favorable for a spin-1 @xmath4rb atom due to the linear zeeman effect and the ferromagnetic interaction , where @xmath5 refers to the magnetic sublevel . on the other hand ,",
    "the quadratic zeeman effect raises the energy of the @xmath6 states relative to that of the @xmath7 state . as a consequence , if the quadratic zeeman effect is sufficiently large , the spin vector of the ferromagnetic ground state not only shrinks but also tilts against the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , even if the hamiltonian is axisymmetric with respect to the direction of the magnetic field , the ground state spontaneously breaks the axisymmetry .",

    "the formation of the domain structure costs the kinetic energy and the ferromagnetic energy at the domain walls .",
    "if the direction of the spin vector changes gradually over space , the formation of the spin texture costs little energy . one of such textures is a topological spin texture , in which the orientation of transverse magnetization has a @xmath217 winding about a central defect .",
    "when the size of the system is small , the topological spin texture becomes energetically favorable and develops spontaneously  @xcite .",
    "recently , formation of the topological spin texture has been observed by the berkeley group  @xcite , in which the state of the system is changed rapidly by a change in the magnetic field from the @xmath218 region to the shaded region in fig .",

    "we have studied a spin-1 ferromagnetic bec by taking the quadratic zeeman effect into account .",

    ", the so(2 ) symmetry is broken , in addition to the u(1 ) global phase symmetry . applying the bogoliubov theory for a bec with spin degrees of freedom ,",
    "we have found one gapful mode and two gapless goldstone modes for this phase .",
    "we have analytically shown that two gapless modes are the coupled phonon - magnon modes that restore the u(1 ) and so(2 ) symmetries simultaneously .",
    "numerical analysis has shown that one goldstone mode is the phonon - dominant mode and the other is the phonon - magnon coupled mode with roughly equal weights .",
    "the gapful mode changes the length of the spin by fluctuating the spin in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : wavealpha.eps ] ) .    when more than one continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken , multiple gapless modes emerge and they couple with each other to form goldstone modes as shown in this paper .",
    "such multiple goldstone modes may therefore be found in spin-2 becs   and higher spin becs , which merit further investigation .",
