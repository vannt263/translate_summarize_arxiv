    "the poisson s ratio , , characterizes the resultant strain in the y - direction for a material under longitudinal deformation in the x - direction .",
    "the poisson s ratio is typically a positive number , and has a value around 0.3 for many engineering materials ( e.g. steels ) .",
    "the value is positive when a material contracts in the transverse directions when stretched uniaxially . in the uniconstant elasticity",
    "theory,@xcite atoms are treated as point particles in a centrosymmetric lattice with only longitudinal interactions .",
    "the tensorial elastic constants of the anisotropic solid are related by the cauchy relations , while the cauchy relations yield a constant value of 1/4 for the poisson s ratio in isotropic solids .",
    "however , uniconstant elasticity theory has not been used for many decades , one reason being that it was subsequently found that the poisson s ratio is not a constant value of 1/4 for all materials . instead , classical elasticity theory , which accounts for both longitudinal and transverse interactions@xcite ,",
    "was found to better represent the poisson effect and poisson s ratio in solids .",
    "there are two independent parameters in the classical elasticity theory ; i.e. , the lam@xmath0 coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 , or the bulk modulus @xmath3 and the shear modulus @xmath2 . instead of a constant value ,",
    "the poisson s ratio in classical elasticity theory depends on the ratio between the bulk modulus and the shear modulus , e.g. @xmath4 for three - dimensional isotropic materials .",
    "the poisson s ratio is limited to the range @xmath5 for three - dimensional isotropic materials within classical elasticity theory .    within classical elasticity theory ,",
    "materials are thus allowed to exhibit a negative poisson s ratio ( npr ) , which are also known as auxetic materials.@xcite one way in which the impact of npr can be gleaned is to note that there exist certain physical properties that are inversely proportional to @xmath6 or @xmath7 , which implies that these properties become infinitely large in the limit of the poisson s ratio @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the is proportional to @xmath9 , and the material hardness is related to @xmath10 , with @xmath11 as a constant .",
    "hence , materials with npr typically have novel properties such as enhanced toughness and enhanced sound and vibration absorption .    in 1987",
    ", lakes performed seminal experiments to illustrate the npr in a foam structure.@xcite since then , many researchers have demonstrated that the npr phenomenon is actually quite common both as an intrinsic material property ( i.e. , npr occurs without any external engineering of the material structure or composition . ) and also in engineered structures.@xcite for example , the poisson s ratio was found to be anisotropic in some cubic elemental metals . while the poisson s ratio is positive along the axial directions in the cubic elemental metals , 69% of the cubic elemental metals have intrinsic npr along a non - axial direction.@xcite a more recent work has found that the poisson s ratio for fcc metals can be negative along some principal directions by proper control over the transverse loading.@xcite    concurrently , nanomaterials , encompassing such well - known materials like buckyballs , carbon nanotubes , graphene , nanowires , black phosphorus , mos@xmath12 and others , have drawn significant interest within the past two decades . within the last three years , the auxetic property has been found in some of these nanomaterials , with the mechanisms underlying the auxetic properties often being due to specific nanoscale physical properties .",
    "some of these new findings were mentioned in a recent review on auxeticity by huang and chen,@xcite but a comprehensive review on this emerging field of auxetic nanomaterials is still lacking . our objective in this review is to survey the novel mechanisms underpinning auxetic behavior in nanomaterials , and to discuss challenges and opportunities for future work .",
    "we do not discuss auxeticity in bulk materials , for which readers are referred to previous review articles.@xcite",
    "we now discuss the mechanisms that enable the emergence of auxeticity in nanomaterials .",
    "the mechanisms can be delineated as intrinsic , and extrinsic , with the intrinsic mechanisms discussed first .",
    "again , we emphasize that intrinsic mechanisms are those that cause npr in the material without any external engineering of the material structure or composition .        [ 1.0 ]    * black phosphorus . * black phosphorus is one of the recent entries to the 2d materials canon , which has drawn attention for its potential as an alternate electronic material to graphene@xcite .",
    "it is characterized by its puckered atomic structure , where fig .",
    "[ fig_cfg_poisson ] shows the smallest puckered cell .",
    "there are two groups of atoms , with 4 , 5 , and 6 in the top group and 1 , 2 , and 3 in the bottom group .",
    "this puckered structure can be obtained geometrically as follows : assuming both top and bottom atoms are initially in a planar honeycomb lattice in the xy plane , compression of the planar lattice in the x - direction will result in puckering of the structure into the top and bottom groups .",
    "this puckered structure is highly anisotorpic .",
    "more specifically , this puckered structure is elastically softer in the x - direction , owing to the construction of inter - group angles like @xmath13 , so the in - plane poisson s ratio @xmath14 is large . as a direct result of the anisotropic puckered structure ,",
    "the poisson s ratio in the z - direction is negative , i.e. the thickness in the z - direction increases during the deformation of the black phosphorus along the y - direction.@xcite this occurs because when the structure is stretched in the y - direction , it undergoes a large contraction along the x - direction due to the large value of @xmath14 , leading to the decrease of inter - group angles like @xmath13 .",
    "that is , the inter - group bond 1 - 4 will be aligned closer to the z - axis , which results in the expansion of the thickness in the z - direction .",
    "interestingly , the pucker can also be regarded as two coupling hinges formed by the angles @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which leads to a nanoscale version of the coupling hinge mechanism .",
    "the npr is thus closely related to the condition of @xmath17 in black phosphorus .",
    "it should be noted that the out - of - plane npr exists concurrently with a large positive value of the in - plane poisson s ratio @xmath14 .    while the npr in the z - direction of black phosphorus was discussed in detail in ref .",
    ", this effect has also been mentioned in some other works , which applied mechanical strains to black phosphorus .",
    "for example , the npr was also observed during the investigation of strain effects on the electronic properties of single - layer black phosphorus@xcite or the thermoelectric properties for bulk black phosphorus.@xcite    * other puckered nanomaterials .",
    "* orthorhombic arsenic shares the same puckered atomic configuration as black phosphorus , and thus is expected to exhibit npr .",
    "this was confirmed in recent first principles calculations by han et al . for few - layer orthorhombic arsenic.@xcite",
    "the poisson s ratio was found to be about -0.093 for single - layer orthorhombic arsenic , while becoming increasing negative with increasing numbers of layers .",
    "the saturation value for the npr , about -0.13 , is reached for the few - layer orthorhombic arsenic with layer number above four .",
    "we close this discussion by noting that the unfolding of the puckered structure is a mechanism that is operant at many length scales , from the nanoscale as seen here to the macroscale , as shown previously.@xcite      while some nanomaterials like black phosphorus exhibit npr for all strains due to their crystal structure , other nanomaterials exhibit intrinsic npr due to other mechanisms .",
    "one is related to the basic deformation mechanisms that nanomaterials undergo , which make either a positive or negative contribution to the poisson s ratio . due to this balance , nanomaterials can exhibit intrinsic npr when the mechanisms leading to npr dominate , as explained in detail below .",

    "the poisson s ratio for the hydrogenated graphene was found to be dependent on the hydrogenation percentage , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_poisson_hydrogen ] .",
    "in particular , by increasing hydrogenation percentage , the poisson s ratio reaches a minimum and negative value for half - hydrogenated graphene , which possesses the ripples with the largest amplitude .",
    "the ripples are weak in the hydrogenated graphene with hydrogenation percentages around 0 and 100% , so the poisson s ratio changes as a linear function of the hydrogenation percentage .",

    "* nanomaterials have some novel features as compared with bulk materials , and some of these novel features can induce considerable auxeticity . for example , surface and edge effects can dominate mechanical properties in nanomaterials , due to their large surface to volume ratios .",

    "while it is certainly more challenging to measure poisson s ratio at the nanoscale , the assembly of nanomaterials can result in macroscale structures , where the experimental equipment needed to measure the poisson s ratio is well established .",

    "such studies have to - date been done on an ad hoc basis for nanomaterials , as a systematic approach for the design and optimization of auxetic nanomaterials has not been developed , which is in contrast to the large literature that has emerged regarding the design and optimization of bulk auxetic materials.@xcite in a similar way , it may be possible to design auxetic structures on the nanoscale level with some specifically chosen basic nanoscale elements such as nanoscale defects , edge / surface effects etc.@xcite        while the search for more auxetic mechanisms and nanomaterials is essential , it is also important to begin investigating possible applications for auxetic nanomaterials . besides the applications commonly proposed for bulk auxetic materials , i.e. tougher materials,@xcite national security and defense , sound and vibration absorption,@xcite it is likely that new , unexpected applications may emerge for nanoscale auxetics due to their unique , nanoscale dimensionality and properties .",
    "for example , the lattice constants of some graphene allotropes are tunable , which enables the hollow lattice structure to be used as a filter.@xcite as one possible application , auxeticity can be exploited in cleaning filters by stretching , as the pore size will increase due to the npr .",
    "graphene with nanopores can be used to determine the sequence of dna molecules with high resolution , which takes advantage of its high stiffness and high in - plane electrical conductivity.@xcite theoretical studies have shown that these free edges can induce auxeticity in graphene for strain less than 1%.@xcite using the abnormal geometrical response ( expand upon stretching ) of the auxetic graphene hole , it may be possible to tune the contact between the graphene hole and the dna molecules , so that the dna sequencing process can be finely tuned through mechanical strain .",
    "these are two speculative applications of auxetic nanomaterials , though we expect that many more will emerge through the ingenious nature of the scientific community .",
    "a final , and likely intellectually rich area for future investigation from both the fundamental scientific point of view as well as the practical application point of view , is the consideration of the coupling of auxetic mechanical properties on other physical properties in nanomaterials .    for bulk materials , the auxetic effects on various physical properties have been widely examined.@xcite the auxetic effects can be obtained directly from the analytic formulas for isotropic materials within the classical elasticity theory .",
    "for example , in three - dimensional isotropic materials , the speed of sound is proportional to @xmath9 , and the hardness is related to @xmath10 with @xmath11 as a constant . hence , auxeticity with @xmath8 leads to the enhanced speed of sound and enhanced toughness .",
    "however , for nanomaterials , very few studies have examined the connection between the poisson s ratio and other physical properties.@xcite furthermore , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_nu_vffm ] ) , the poisson s ratio for graphene is in the range @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that traditional bulk auxetic applications , such as enhanced speeds of sound or toughness , may need to be re - examined for graphene and probably other nanomaterials .",
