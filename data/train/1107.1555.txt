    "in conclusion , we have studied a mixture of spinor boson and fermion in a shallow 2d optical lattice using rg and have shown that the presence of an on - site spin - spin interaction between the bosons and the fermions leads to a separation of fermi surface of the spin - up and spin - down fermions irrespective of the nature of the bare interaction between the fermions provided that the bosons are in the spinor condensate state .",
    "such a separation , depending on the density of the fermions , may give rise to a net spin polarization for the fermi superfluid .",
    "further , for attractive interaction between these fermions , we have shown that the leading instability of the metallic state of the fermions lies in the tsf channel with down spin pairing . in particular , we predict that for fermions coupled to a spinor bosonic condensate in its ferromagnetic phase via a spin - spin interactions , attractive interactions will induce a down - spin triplet pairing superfluid instability over the otherwise more common singlet pairing instability .",

    "<S> we study a mixture of ultracold spin - half fermionic and spin - one bosonic atoms in a shallow optical lattice where the bosons are coupled to the fermions via both density - density and spin - spin interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the parameter regime where the bosons are in a superfluid ground state , integrate them out , and obtain an effective action for the fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a renormalization group analysis of this effective fermionic action at low temperatures , show that the presence of the spinor bosons may lead to a separation of fermi surfaces of the spin - up and spin - down fermions , and investigate the parameter range where this phenomenon occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the susceptibilities corresponding to the possible superfluid instabilities of the fermions and obtain their possible broken - symmetry ground states at low temperatures and weak interactions . </S>"
