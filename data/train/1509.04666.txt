    "the past decade has witnessed a tremendous resurgence of interest in the physics of quantum many - body systems out of equilibrium .",
    "this growth has been partly motivated by remarkable developments in experiments , especially in experiments on cold atoms , which made the explicit observation of time evolution of many - body quantum systems possible @xcite .",
    "in addition to the experimental motivation , fundamental conceptual issues , such as thermalization in isolated systems and the nature of adiabaticity , have also played a strong role in driving the development of this field .",
    "a central paradigm in the study of non - equilibrium physics is the _ quantum quench_. a quantum quench involves a protocol starting from the ground state ( or a thermal state or another eigenstate ) of an ` initial ' hamiltonian @xmath0 , and then rapidly changing the hamiltonian so that nontrivial time evolution occurs under a different ( ` final ' ) hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "many aspects of the dynamics induced by quantum quenches have been considered in recent years ; the literature is rapidly growing and already too vast to review here .",
    "a quantum quench can lead to nontrivial dynamics as the initial state generally has overlap with many eigenstates of the final hamiltonian .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the final hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath4 , an initial state @xmath5 will lead to the following time dependence of the system wavefunction : @xmath6 if a large number of final eigenstates have non - negligible overlap @xmath7 , this sum can lead to highly nontrivial time dependence .",
    "clearly , both the overlaps @xmath8 and the corresponding eigenenergies @xmath3 are important in determining the subsequent dynamics .",
    "the object of study of the present paper is the distribution of overlaps , i.e. , the overlap magnitudes @xmath7 as a function of energy @xmath3 .",
    "we will refer to this as the `` overlap distribution '' .",
    "note that , if the squares @xmath9 were considered , this could be regarded as a discrete probability distribution , as @xmath10 and the squares @xmath9 represent probabilities .",
    "since @xmath7 and @xmath9 provide equivalent information , we will focus on @xmath7 .",
    "also note that the distribution of phases of @xmath11 may provide useful information but are not individually well - defined , since the phases of individual eigenstates @xmath2 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "this work presents an investigation of the features of the overlap distribution for various quenches in a particular system . in this introductory section ,",
    "we provide motivation for the study of the overlap distribution , by reviewing its connections to topics that have attracted widespread attention in recent years .",
    "the overlap distribution is closely related to the statistics of the work performed in a quench , which is characterized by the so - called work distribution : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the initial energy .",
    "the work distribution is thus simply a continuous version of the distribution of squared overlaps , with the zero of the energy shifted by @xmath13 .",
    "the work statistics in non - equilibrium processes in various quantum many - body systems is a topic of much recent interest @xcite .",
    "another quantity of wide current interest , closely related to the overlap distribution and work distribution , is the return probability , @xmath14 this is a special case of the loschmidt echo where the reverse time evolution occurs under the hamiltonian @xmath0 , for which the initial state @xmath5 is an eigenstate .",
    "following common practice , we will refer to this quantity simply as the loschmidt echo .",
    "the behavior of the loschmidt echo after a quantum quench has been studied in a large body of recent literature , see , e.g. , @xcite . in particular , the loschmidt echo is central to the study of so - called dynamical phase transitions @xcite . by expanding @xmath5 in terms of the eigenstates @xmath2 of the final hamiltonian @xmath1",
    ", we find @xmath15 knowledge of the overlap distribution , i.e. , the @xmath7 s and corresponding @xmath3 s , thus leads directly to the loschmidt echo .",
    "for example , the energy width of the distribution determines the coefficient of the initial quadratic decay of @xmath16 , as it can be seen by expanding @xmath17 in eq .",
    "to second order in @xmath18 @xcite .    after a quench ,",
    "a generic observable @xmath19 has the following time evolution : @xmath20 the long - time behavior of such expectation values , @xmath21 , is of fundamental interest since this is closely related to the question of whether an isolated quantum system thermalizes in some sense . as outlined above , this long - time limit is determined solely by the overlap magnitudes and the diagonal matrix elements .",
    "this is often called the `` diagonal ensemble '' value of the long - time limit @xcite .",
    "the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) , which is expected to hold for non - integrable systems , postulates that the diagonal matrix elements @xmath22 are smooth functions of eigenenergy , for large enough systems @xcite .",
    "the question of thermalization can then reduce to the question of how narrow in energy the overlap distribution is .",
    "recent work ( such as the `` quench action '' approach @xcite and an approach based on linked - cluster expansions @xcite ) has formulated calculations of long - time expectation values directly in the thermodynamic limit , thus avoiding the explicit calculation of overlaps in finite - size systems . the diagonal ensemble formulation of eq .   for finite sizes , involving the overlap distribution @xmath7 , will play an essential role in the discussion of such calculations for long - time stationary state values of observables , in particular for comparing the ordering of the limiting procedures ( limits of large sizes and large times ) .",
    "we also note that the overlaps @xmath11 appear not only in the long - time limit , but also in the arbitrary - time expression for @xmath23 ( cf .",
    "eq .  ) , although in this case the phases of @xmath11 are also important .    from the discussion above ,",
    "it is clear that the overlap distribution plays a central role in many aspects of quench dynamics .",
    "numerical data on overlap distributions have appeared in many different non - equilibrium studies for specific quenches , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite where the overlap distributions are called `` local density of states '' , in refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of thermalization , in ref .",
    "@xcite in connection with intermediate - time behaviors of the loschmidt echo , and in ref .",
    "@xcite for a spin spiral initial state .",
    "there have been , however , relatively few systematic studies of the overlap distribution so far .",
    "the present work is a step towards addressing this gap in the literature .",
    "we provide a detailed study of the overlap distribution for a well - known model system , namely the one - dimensional anisotropic spin-1/2 heisenberg model ( xxz chain ) at zero magnetization .",
    "we consider quenches of the anisotropy parameter @xmath24 , see eq .  , and provide an overview of the overlap distributions obtained in quenches from various initial @xmath25 values to various final @xmath26 values , using full numerical diagonalization .",
    "for the special case of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , i.e. , quenching from the nel state to the so - called xx point , we present a full analytical study of the overlap distribution .",
    "the xx point is mappable to a chain of free fermions , which allows this detailed analysis .",
    "we find that all nonzero overlaps are exactly equal and derive expressions for them , using the slater determinant structure of the xx eigenfunctions , as well as using the bethe ansatz .",
    "we derive the selection rules determining the eigenstates that have nonzero overlaps for this quench , both in the language of fermionic momenta and using the language of bethe roots .",
    "we show how these results on the overlap distribution can be used to derive explicit expressions for the loschmidt echo @xmath16 and for equal - time correlators after the quench . for quenches ending at small but nonzero anisotropy , @xmath29",
    ", a splitting structure appears in the overlap distribution ; we analyze the main features of this structure using perturbation theory .",
    "similarly , for quenches to the xx point starting from large but finite initial value @xmath30 , a perturbative expansion in @xmath31 explains the structure of the overlap distribution .    after introducing the model and some notation in sec .",

    "[ sec : numerical ] .",
    "section [ sec : b ] is devoted to a detailed analysis of the @xmath32 case .",
    "we also use the results for the overlap distribution to derive analytical expressions for time - dependent quantities , in particular , for the loschmidt echo and for longitudinal and transverse two - point correlators .",

    "this work focuses on the one - dimensional anisotropic spin-1/2 heisenberg model ( xxz chain ) with nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 being the usual pauli matrices , and @xmath39 .",
    "we will refer to the @xmath40 part of the hamiltonian as the xx hamiltonian : @xmath41 . throughout this manuscript",
    "we choose the number @xmath42 of lattice sites to be even .",
    "we also distinguish between two different types of boundary conditions . for an open chain we set @xmath43 , for a periodic chain @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the xxz chain is a natural generalization of the isotropic heisenberg chain  @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most widely studied models in quantum magnetism in particular , and condensed matter physics in general .",
    "it is absolutely central to the study of integrability , having a relatively simple integrable structure , yet possessing rich physics and displaying a phase transition . in the current era of non - equilibrium physics",
    ", it has been widely used as a model system to explore and exemplify non - equilibrium phenomena , including studies of the loschmidt echo ( e.g.  @xcite ) , studies of quenches of the anisotropy parameter @xmath24 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and of quenches starting from a nel state ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "dynamics starting from various non - uniform states ( such as domain wall initial states ) , leading to propagation or transmission along the xxz chain , is also a rapidly growing topic of investigation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the xxz chain is also being increasingly used to study real - time thermal transport and real - time dynamics at finite temperatures .",
    "it is a primary testbed for developments and applications of bethe ansatz techniques for addressing non - equilibrium issues ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore find the xxz chain to be an appropriate model for a systematic study of the work distribution in quantum quenches .    in this work",
    ", we restrict to positive anisotropies @xmath46 .",
    "the isotropic critical point @xmath47 separates two regimes with different behaviors ; in terms of low - energy physics , the @xmath48 regime is gapless , while the @xmath49 regime is gapped .",
    "the hamiltonian commutes with the @xmath50-component @xmath51 of the total spin operator . for",
    "the zero magnetization sector contains the ground state for all @xmath49 .",
    "our initial states are ground states of the xxz chain and , hence , lie in the zero magnetization sector .",
    "thus , we can restrict to the subspace spanned by energy eigenstates @xmath2 with @xmath52 . at @xmath40",
    "the chain can be mapped onto a gas of free fermions via the jordan - wigner mapping , and subsequently solved using free - fermion techniques . for generic values of the anisotropy parameter",
    "@xmath24 the xxz model is integrable and can be solved by means of bethe ansatz techniques  @xcite . in the fermionic language",
    "the anisotropy @xmath24 acts as the strength of nearest - neighbor interactions",
    ".    a particular focus of this work will be on quenches starting from the purely antiferromagnetic regime ( @xmath53 ) . in the limit @xmath53",
    "the initial hamiltonian effectively becomes the ising hamiltonian , @xmath54 .",
    "the ground state of @xmath55 is exactly degenerate , with both symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the nel states having the same energy .",
    "for @xmath25 large but finite this degeneracy is lifted .",
    "we denote the two nel states as @xmath56 for @xmath27 , any linear combination of @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a valid ground state and , in principle , any such linear combination could be chosen as the initial state with which to calculate overlaps .",
    "physically , we find it most reasonable to choose the symmetric combination for @xmath59 even and the antisymmetric combination for @xmath59 odd , which is adiabatically connected to the ( unique ) ground state for @xmath25 large but finite , @xmath60 for the periodic chain we set @xmath61 with @xmath62 . since @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the translation operator by one lattice site , @xmath65 is nothing but the momentum of the initial state . for the open chain , @xmath66",
    "is related to the symmetry of @xmath67 under reflection , @xmath68 maps lattice site @xmath69 to @xmath70 for all @xmath71 .",
    "recently , some progress has been made in calculating overlaps using the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "there are now exact formulas for the overlap between a nel state and any eigenstate in terms of the bethe roots describing the eigenstate @xcite . by taking the thermodynamic limit of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , it was possible to investigate the long - time limit in quenches to the antiferromagnetic gapped phase @xmath72 @xcite and also to the isotropic point @xmath73 @xcite , using the quench action approach @xcite . however , extracting all the overlaps for large but finite chains by means of the exact formulas of refs .",
    "@xcite is technically quite challenging .",
    "for this reason , in this work we will use these forumlas only in the limit @xmath74 , where the structure of bethe roots is well understood .",
    "in this section we present an overview of the features of overlap distributions for quenches from various @xmath25 to various @xmath26 , obtained using numerical exact diagonalization .",
    "we present overlaps with only those eigenstates of the post - quench hamiltonian @xmath1 that lie in the zero magnetization sector .",
    "since the initial states are always in this sector , eigenstates of @xmath1 in other magnetization sectors have zero overlap due to symmetry .    in cases where eigenstates of @xmath1 are ( nearly or exactly ) degenerate",
    ", numerical diagonalization might give overlaps with arbitrary linear combinations of the ( nearly ) degenerate eigenstates .",
    "in all cases where we discuss visible features of the overlap distribution , we have taken care to resolve such degeneracies .",
    "there are more degeneracies for periodic chains , so we show mainly open - chain data .",
    "we have checked in each case that the qualitative features are very similar for open and periodic chains .      as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , for quenches starting from @xmath27 we choose as the initial state @xmath75 the combination @xmath76 of nel states as defined in eq .  .",
    "overlap distributions for @xmath27 to @xmath28 quenches are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : infty2zero ] , for both open and periodic chains .",
    "the remarkable feature of these distributions is that the overlaps are either zero or have exactly equal nonzero value .",
    "there is no reason to expect that the ground state at @xmath77 should have any particular preference between low - energy and high - energy eigenstates of the @xmath40 hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , such a physical argument does not suffice to predict that the nonzero overlaps should all be exactly equal .",
    "this is a particular feature of the nel - to - xx quench in the xxz chain .    .",
    "data are shown for both open and periodic chains , for two different system sizes .",
    "there are @xmath78 nonzero overlaps , all exactly equal to @xmath79 which is @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 . in the periodic cases some of the nonzero overlaps are not visually distinguishable because of degeneracies , e.g. , in panel ( c )",
    "there are four degenerate nonzero overlaps at @xmath84.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    among the @xmath85 final eigenstates in the zero magnetization sector , only @xmath78 have nonzero @xmath11 s .",
    "the number of nonzero overlaps fixes the nonzero values to be @xmath86 , by virtue of normalization and the fact that they are all equal .",
    "the counting can sometimes be tricky due to degeneracies .",
    "for example , there appears to be only five instead of eight nonzero overlaps in the @xmath81 periodic case in fig .",
    "[ fig : infty2zero](c ) .",
    "this is because the symbol at the center represents four exactly degenerate eigenstates , which can not be distinguished .",
    "there are also few eigenstates with the same eigenenergy but zero overlap .",
    "of course , any linear combination of the degenerate eigenstates is also a valid eigenstate .",
    "so , there is some ambiguity in the overlaps plotted . by choosing the eigenstates to be the appropriate ` slater determinants ' in fermionic language ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : b ] ) , the overlaps turn out to be either zero or @xmath86 .    the overlap distribution for quenches from @xmath27 to @xmath28 will be analyzed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : b ] , in particular we will derive the selection rules , which determine whether or not an eigenstate has nonzero overlap .",

    "however , the pattern of distortion is rather remarkable .",
    "the @xmath78 nonzero overlaps now split into two well - defined branches ; one branch is shifted upwards and one branch is shifted downwards , see fig .",

    ".    we will refer to the difference @xmath89 of the absolute value of the nel overlap with an eigenstate of the @xmath90 hamiltonian and the nel overlap at @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath79 , as the `` shift '' of the overlap .",
    "the splitting structure is well - defined as long as the shift is much smaller than @xmath79 ; otherwise the lower branch is difficult to distinguish from the states with near - zero overlap .",
    "it is useful to normalize the shift with respect to the @xmath28 value , i.e. , for each eigenstate connected to one having nonzero overlap at @xmath28 , we define @xmath91 in fig .",

    "we see this to be linear with @xmath26 at fixed @xmath42 , and linear with @xmath42 at fixed @xmath26 , i.e. , proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "this indicates that the shift can be calculated perturbatively in @xmath26 for any finite chain .",

    "the overlap distribution has no striking pattern , and no obvious remnant of the flat distribution at @xmath28 .",
    "a slight bias toward smaller energies is visible .",

    "in addition , we will show in the subsection below that the result implies that the smallest and largest normalized shifts grow linearly with @xmath42 , so that the normalized average branch shifts grow linearly with @xmath42 , as found numerically , see fig .",

    "in this section we use a perturbative approach to explain one of the features of the overlap distribution that can be observed in the quench protocol from @xmath25 large but finite to the free fermion point @xmath28 . as it can be seen in fig .",

    ". the slope increases with decreasing @xmath25 .",
    "this behavior is in sharp contrast to the splitting structures of the @xmath33 case . in the following",
    "we will use perturbation theory in @xmath31 to show that the normalized shift is proportional to @xmath3 at first order ( for periodic chains ) , which explains the smooth behavior of the @xmath7 s as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we will also compute the quadratic correction by making use of second order perturbation theory .    for simplicity",
    "we consider a periodic chain . in the case of an open chain",
    "the main steps of the following calculation can be similarly performed , but there are complications because of the edges .",
    "the initial state @xmath75 , which is the ground state at large but finite @xmath25 , is adiabatically connected to the state @xmath76 , which we have used as the initial state for @xmath27 : @xmath351 in order to make the perturbative calculation mathematically stringent , we divide the initial hamiltonian ( and henceforth all corresponding energies ) by @xmath25 .",
    "we consider the second term in @xmath352 as a small perturbation .    in order to analyze the overlaps @xmath353 , where latexmath:[$    final hamiltonian with @xmath28 , perturbatively , we expand the ground state @xmath75 of @xmath0 in the small parameter @xmath31 , @xmath355 the zeroth - order ( unperturbed ) wavefunction is @xmath356 .",
    "the energy eigenvalue @xmath357 of @xmath76 is two - fold degenerate at zeroth order and the corresponding other state is simply @xmath358 . since the two states @xmath358 and @xmath5 ( with @xmath66 fixed ) are both eigenstates of the translation operator with opposite eigenvalues @xmath359 and @xmath66 , we deduce @xmath360 .",
    "this means that @xmath358 does not appear in any expansion of @xmath361 .",
    "we can therefore apply non - degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "using @xmath362 the higher order corrections read @xmath363 where @xmath364 is the eigenvalue of @xmath365 with eigenstate @xmath366 .",
    "we first compute the matrix elements in the numerator of eq .",

    "the energies @xmath364 are all the same , independent of the choice of @xmath370 and given by @xmath371 .",
    "therefore , @xmath372 for all @xmath373 and , henceforth , @xmath374 thus , the first - order term is obtained by application of @xmath375 on the initial state ( a similar trick was used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    using that the states @xmath316 are eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath305 with energy @xmath376 we obtain up to first order @xmath377    the second order term is a bit more involved .",
    "the first term in eq .   can be computed as @xmath378 for each fixed state @xmath379 there are of order @xmath380 many terms for which the flipped spins do not connect to each other and for which the energy difference is simply @xmath381 .",
    "in contrast , there are only of order @xmath42 many terms for which the energy difference is not given by this value .",
    "we drop these terms because they are subleading in @xmath42 . since the second and the third term in eq .",
    "are also negligible with respect to the leading contribution , we obtain @xmath382 the normalized overlap therefore reads , up to second order in @xmath31 and by neglecting the @xmath101 contributions , @xmath383 this provides a second order correction for the nontrivial part of the overlap distribution in the quench protocol from @xmath30 to @xmath28 .    note",
    "that the energy @xmath376 is extensive and bounded by @xmath384 .",
    "so , if the condition @xmath385 is fulfilled , we expect the perturbation series to converge .",
    "the data for open chains from numerical exact diagonalization , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fromlarge ] , is described reasonably well by the large-@xmath42 perturbative results derived in this section for periodic chains .",
    "motivated by the observation that the overlap distribution is important for many aspects of quench dynamics , in this work we have considered a prominent paradigm model , the xxz chain , and undertaken a systematic study of the properties of the overlap distribution for quenches of the anisotropy parameter @xmath24 . using numerical exact diagonalization ,",
    "we have provided a broad overview of the features of the overlap distribution , for quenches from various values @xmath25 to various values of @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , we have thoroughly analyzed the quench from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , i.e. , when the initial state is of the form ( combination of nel states ) and the post - quench hamiltonian is described by a free - fermion theory through jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "the overlap distribution in this case has the remarkable feature of being ` flat ' : all nonzero overlaps have the same value . using the free - fermion structure of the post - quench eigenstates , it was possible to analyze the overlap distribution analytically , to express the overlaps using determinant formulas , and to explicitly calculate their values ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : b ] ) .",
    "the states that have nonzero overlap can be chosen using certain ` selection rules ' .",
    "one rule arises from the spatial structure of the nel states , while a second rule arises from the symmetry of the initial state , in terms of translation ( periodic boundary conditions ) or reflection ( open boundary conditions ) .",
    "the ` selection rules ' for the periodic chain have been compared with results that we derived from recently obtained bethe ansatz formulas @xcite .",
    "we found that these rules can be equivalently expressed in terms of adjacent corners of rectangles in the pattern of possible xx bethe roots .",
    "we also provided two example applications of our detailed understanding of the overlap distribution for the @xmath237 quench . using the selection rules",
    ", we were able to provide concise expressions for the loschmidt echo ( return probability ) as well as equal - time two - point correlators after the quench .",
    "in particular , time - dependent transverse correlators , @xmath386 , are somewhat nontrivial due to jordan - wigner strings .",
    "we provide determinant formulas for such correlators , derived by making use of the selection rules .    for quenches from @xmath27 to small @xmath95",
    ", the overlap distribution shows a splitting structure which we analyzed perturbatively ( perturbation in @xmath26 , see sec .",
    "[ sec : a ] ) . for quenches from large @xmath387 to @xmath28 ,",
    "the overlap distribution acquires a simple dependence on energy which we analyzed using perturbation theory in @xmath31 , see sec .",
    "[ sec : c ] .",
    "the present work is related in various ways to recent advances in non - equilibrium physics .",
    "many recent publications have provided overlap distributions for specific quenches .",
    "this motivates systematic studies like the present one . using the bethe ansatz ,",
    "formulas are now available @xcite for the overlap between nel states and bethe eingestates at any @xmath24 .",
    "since the use of these results requires knowledge of the bethe roots describing all eigenstates , it is technically challenging to explore overlap distributions using this approach .",
    "our numerical overview and detailed explicit analysis of specific cases thus provides specific contexts for these general technical results .",
    "our applications to loschmidt echoes and correlators can be compared with existing calculations of the loschmidt echo @xcite and of longitudinal correlators @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to these approaches , we have used the structure of the overlap distribution to derive time - dependent quantities .",
    "this has allowed us to obtain some new expressions .",
    "finally , certain overlaps with low energy eigenstates in the gapless phase @xmath388 can be studied using field - theoretical methods . in particular , subleading terms in such overlaps @xcite allow to access universal data about the underlying conformal field theory .",
    "our focus here , in contrast , has been on the full spectrum , not just low - energy physics .",
    "this work opens up many new questions .",
    "first of all , the present study is by no means exhaustive .",
    "there are features of the overlap distribution in the xxz chain which remain to be analyzed in detail .",
    "for example , the physical nature of the eigenstates which have large overlap for @xmath102 to @xmath26 of order one quenches ( or vice versa ) , are unclear and might deserve further study .",
    "second , in addition to the applications we have provided for the cleanest case ( @xmath237 ) . it might be possible to exploit the observations on overlap distributions in other quench protocols ( other @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) to extract properties of the time dependence of loschmidt echoes and correlation functions . finally , it would certainly be interesting to analyze overlap distributions in a series of other models .",
    "one could ask , for example , whether integrability plays a general role in determining the features of the overlap distribution .",
