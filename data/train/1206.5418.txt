    "heterostructures formed by quantum dot ( qd ) sheets are widely investigated and used in different devices , such as lasers , photodetectors , and solar cells , see @xcite for review . in such heterostructures , not only the additional localized states of electrons captured into qds",
    "should be taken into account but also the continuous electronic states , which are subjected to reflections on periodically placed qd sheets , should be modified significantly .",
    "such a periodical perturbation gives rise to a superlattice ( sl ) with energy spectrum formed by gaps between allowed minibands .",
    "in contrast to the standard case , @xcite an additional damping of electronic states takes place due to scattering on inhomogeneties of qd sheets stemming from a random in - plane distribution of qds .",
    "but such a damping appears to be weak for low - energy region . as a result",
    ", sl effect should be essential near the edge of interband absorption in host material , which is proportional to the density of states of sl , or under ir transitions from doped qds into miniband states .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , these phenomena were not considered based on a simultaneous description of sl minibands and damping effects in spite of the structures under consideration are routinely used in different optoelectronic devices . at the same time the opposite case of 3d ordering of the closely spaced qds , when sl is formed as a result of the tunneling mix between intra - qd states , was analyzed @xcite and demonstrated experimentally , see @xcite and references therein . because of this , it is important and timely to develop an adequate theory of low - energy electrons interacting with the periodically - placed qd sheets and to study the optical response of sl which can be used for characterization of structures under consideration and for description of different optoelectronic devices",
    ".    in this paper we study low - energy electronic states , with energies in the vicinity of the conduction band extremum , in heterosrtuctures formed by qd sheets of period @xmath0 using the effective - mass equations for the green s function averaged over randomly placed qds in each sheet .",
    "in contrast to the standard theoretical description based on the averaging over 3d or 2d space , @xcite , here we perform the averaging over qd sheets with the identical statistical characteristics . as a result , we obtain the inhomogeneous along sl axis dyson equation where the self - energy function can be replaced by the boundary conditions at qd sheets .",
    "since the damping of the low - energy states is weak , one can consider sl which characteristics are determined by an effective potential localized at the sheet positions , @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "the strength of this potential is determined by the concentration of qds and shape of qd potential . with respect to low - energy states ,",
    "qd can be considered as a short - range defect ( which are widely investigated during past 50 years , see refs .",
    "9 ) if the low - energy interval under consideration is smaller than the qd binding energy .",
    "the density of states in sl depends on the period @xmath0 and on the parameter determined by a strength of qd s potential described within the short - range approximation .",
    "spectral dependencies of interband absorption between the heavy - hole and sl states are proportional to the density of states in @xmath3-band .",
    "in addition , the anisotropic absorption coefficient , originated due to mid - ir transitions from the doped qd ground state into the miniband states of sl , is obtained through the qd concentration and the sl parameters .",
    "we found that the efficiency of mid - ir photoexcitation is comparable to the contribution of wetting layers formed under qd sheets @xcite if doping levels are the same .",
    "but the spectral dependencies are very different for these two mechanisms .",
    "thus , it is demonstrated that the results obtained can be used for characterization of structure under consideration .",
    "it is more important that the sl parameters determine a mechanism of vertical transport for underbarrier electrons which is a key process in different optoelectronic devices exploiting multi - qd sheets .",
    "similar mechanism of transport through underbarrier states of ir photodetectors formed by gaas / algaas - based sl was considered in ref .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we describe the model of periodical sheets formed by randomly placed qds and evaluate the green s function averaged over random positions of qds .",

    "iii . list of assumptions used and concluding remarks are presented in the last section .",
    "appendix contains the justification of the effective sl approach employed in the calculations performed .",
