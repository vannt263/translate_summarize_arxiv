    "gauge coupling unification can be considered as one of the most striking successes of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "together with the understanding of the pattern of the sm fermion gauge quantum numbers within grand unified theories ( guts ) , it represents one of the most convincing and quantitatively precise hints of physics beyond the sm model .",
    "the possibility to account for gauge coupling unification translates into a prediction of the strong coupling @xmath1 in good agreement with the measured value , within the uncertainties associated to low energy and ( unknown ) high energy thresholds .",
    "the scale @xmath2 at which the couplings unify is also predicted to be @xmath3 .",
    "the mssm prediction assumes that no additional fields appear in the spectrum before the unification scale : the so - called `` desert '' .",
    "the study of the impact on gauge coupling unification of new fields with a mass between @xmath2 and the electroweak scale has a long history  @xcite and is based on at least two motivations .",
    "first , the appearance of new fields at a scale lower than @xmath2 is predicted by many theories beyond the sm . since the unified gauge group is broken below @xmath2 , such new fields will in general spoil gauge coupling unification . with enough parameters around ,",
    "the latter can often be fixed , but only at the price of loosing what in the mssm is an insightful prediction . as an example",
    ", neutrino masses are associated to lepton number violation , which can be due to right - handed neutrinos living one to five orders of magnitude below @xmath4 . when right - handed neutrino masses are associated with the breaking of the su(2)@xmath5 subgroup of so(10 ) ,",
    "unification is affected , but can be fixed with an appropriate choice of the scale of right - handed neutrinos @xcite .    the second important motivation for studying the effect of new fields on unification is raising the gut scale @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is crucial for proton decay . within the @xmath6-parity conserving mssm ,",
    "proton decay is induced by dimension five and six operators . while dimension six operators are typically harmless , the decay rate induced by dimension five operators is often close or even above the experimental limit , depending on the embedding into the unified theory .",
    "for example , the minimal embedding into su(5 ) is already excluded by the present bound on proton lifetime  @xcite for @xmath7 ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "raising the gut scale is also useful in many string theory models in which the gut scale turns out to be one order of magnitude larger than @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that fields forming complete su(5 ) multiplets do not affect the prediction of @xmath8 at the one loop level , independently of the scale at which they are added .",
    "this is useful but it does not address the above motivations .",
    "in particular , their presence does not affect @xmath4 ( at the one - loop level ) .",
    "in this short note we discuss what we call `` magic '' sets of fields .",
    "these are sets of vectorlike sm chiral superfields that do not form full su(5 ) multiplets but share their benefits regarding gauge coupling unification : i ) they exactly preserve the 1-loop mssm prediction for @xmath9 and ii ) they do it independently of the value of their ( common ) mass . in particular , they maintain the predictivity of the mssm , in the sense that their mass does not represent an additional parameter that can be tuned in order to fix @xmath9 ( at one loop ) . at the same time",
    ", magic sets do not form full su(5 ) multiplets and therefore typically do have an impact on @xmath2 , which is larger the further away they are from @xmath4 . in particular , there are several magic field sets that raise the gut scale .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secmag ] , we define the magic fields and discuss their effect on the gut scale . in section  [ sec : origin ]",
    "we show that such fields can indeed be obtained from a unified theory . in section  [ sec : ps ] we consider the case in which the unified group so(10 ) is broken in two steps , so that the gauge group below the unification scale is not the sm one . in section  [ sec : applications ] we discuss a few applications of magic fields .",
    "in particular , we consider the possibility to suppress kaluza - klein threshold effects in the context of unified theories with extra dimensions and gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models with magic messengers .",
    "in the appendix , we give systematic lists of magic fields .",
    "we consider the mssm with additional vectorlike matter superfields at a scale @xmath10 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath11 , @xmath12 the 1-loop beta function coefficients for the three sm gauge couplings . at scales",
    "@xmath13 , the mssm spectrum gives @xmath14 . at @xmath15 ,",
    "the beta coefficients include the contribution @xmath16 of the new fields , @xmath17 and the 1-loop running gives @xmath18 the mssm 1-loop prediction for @xmath9 , @xmath19 is exactly preserved independently of the scale @xmath20 if @xcite @xmath21 in this case , the unification scale becomes @xmath22 with @xmath23 and the unified gauge coupling is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the value in the mssm , @xmath26 .",
    "complete gut multiplets give the same contribution to the three beta functions and thus trivially satisfy eq .",
    "( [ magcond ] ) ; they preserve gauge coupling unification and leave the gut scale unchanged .",
    "we call `` magic '' all other vectorlike sets of fields that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ magcond ] ) and therefore preserve the 1-loop mssm prediction for @xmath9 .",
    "they fall into two categories : those with @xmath27 , which just mimic the effect of complete gut multiplets and those with @xmath28 , which change the gut scale according to eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 also determines the relative order of the three scales @xmath20 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "there are five different possibilities :    * @xmath27 @xmath30 @xmath31 : * standard unification*. + this corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "the gut scale is unchanged .",
    "the new fields can form complete gut multiplets , but not necessarily .",
    "* @xmath33 @xmath30 @xmath34 : * retarded unification*. + the new fields slow the convergence of the gauge couplings .",
    "the simplest example of magic fields leading to retarded unification is @xmath35 , ] which gives @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the running of the gauge couplings is shown in fig  [ fig : retarded ] .",
    "* @xmath38 @xmath30 @xmath39 : * fake unification*. + this case corresponds to @xmath40 .",
    "the unified group is broken at a scale @xmath41 , but the couplings run together between @xmath42 and @xmath2 , thus faking unification at the lower scale @xmath4 .",
    "note that in this case @xmath2 is undetermined , while @xmath20 is fixed .",
    "a simple example can be obtained by adding the fields @xmath43 of so(10 ) . ] , which gives @xmath44 ( see fig  [ fig : fake ] ) .",
    "this possibility was previously considered in @xcite . * @xmath45 @xmath30 @xmath46 : * hoax unification*. + in this scenario the magic set turns a convergent running into a divergent one and vice versa . therefore",
    "such a field content can not be added at a scale smaller than @xmath4 , or the gauge couplings would diverge above @xmath20 and never meet .",
    "however unification is preserved if the magic fields are heavier than @xmath4 .",
    "then the couplings , after an hoax crossing at @xmath4 , diverge between @xmath4 and @xmath20 , start to converge above @xmath20 and finally unify at @xmath2 , the scale where the unified group is broken .",
    "for example , the fields @xmath47 is contained both in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 of so(10 ) .",
    "] give @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( see fig  [ fig : hoax ] ) .",
    "* @xmath52 @xmath30 @xmath53 : * anticipated unification*. + the magic content accelerates the convergence of the gauge couplings and the unification takes place before the usual gut scale",
    ". this possibility can be useful in combination with other types of magic sets at different scales .",
    "some comments are in order :    * in the above considerations , the scale @xmath20 is arbitrary , as long as @xmath54 and the unified gauge coupling is in the perturbative regime , @xmath55 . * if we restrict our analysis to representations that can be obtained from the decomposition of su(5 ) multiplets under @xmath56 , then both @xmath57 and @xmath58 are integers . in this case",
    "the magic condition requires @xmath57 to be even and @xmath59 to be a multiple of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "therefore in the case of retarded unification the only possibility is @xmath61 , which corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "the expression for the gut scale ( [ scale ] ) becomes particularly simple : @xmath62 therefore , in this scenario , @xmath20 can not be lower than @xmath63 gev , in order to keep @xmath54 . * an important property following from eq .",
    "( @xmath64 ) is that combinations of magic sets at different scales do not spoil unification . in particular , merging two or more sets at the same scale gives again a magic set .",
    "two simple rules are : adding two retarded solutions gives a fake solution , and adding a fake to a retarded solution or to another fake gives a hoax solution can be rewritten in terms of the parameter @xmath65 used by @xcite . anticipated unification then corresponds to @xmath66 , standard unification to @xmath67 , retarded to @xmath68 , fake to @xmath69 , and hoax to @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath71 of a combination of magic fields sets is the sum of the individual @xmath71 s , from which the rules follow trivially . ] .",
    "in this section we show that magic field sets at a scale @xmath72 can indeed arise from the spontaneous breaking of a supersymmetric so(10 ) gut at the scale @xmath2 .",
    "we will illustrate this in three examples for the case of retarded , fake , and hoax unification    * 1 . *",
    "the simplest example of a magic field content leading to retarded unification is @xmath73 , which can be obtained by splitting the components of a @xmath74 of so(10 ) . as an example , such a splitting is provided by the following superpotential : @xmath75 here and below , all dimensionless couplings are supposed to be @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath78 is assumed to get a vev of order @xmath2 along the @xmath79 direction .",
    "then , the above superpotential gives a mass of order @xmath2 to all fields except @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , which are assumed to get a mass at a lower scale @xmath20 .",
    "a two - loop analysis shows that the prediction for @xmath0 does not significantly differ from the mssm one .",
    "an example of fields leading to fake unification is @xmath83 which can be embedded into a @xmath84 of so(10 ) .",
    "this magic field set can be obtained from the following superpotential @xmath85 if @xmath78 gets a vev of order @xmath86 along the @xmath87 direction .",
    "another example is @xmath88 , which can be obtained by a generalization of the superpotential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ret - sp ] )    * 3 . * as an example for hoax unification , we consider the set @xmath89 , which can be embedded into a @xmath90 .",
    "an example of superpotential is @xmath91 again with the vev of @xmath78 along the @xmath87 direction .",
    "the necessity of achieving gauge coupling unification in the presence of fields not forming full unified multiplets may arise in the context of a two - step breaking of so(10 ) : so(10 ) is broken at the scale @xmath2 to the intermediate group @xmath92 , which is then broken to the sm at a lower scale @xmath93 .",
    "in fact , the presence of an intermediate gauge group at a lower scale @xmath94 often spoils gauge unification if no further fields are added .",
    "this is because the additional gauge bosons of @xmath95 are not necessarily in full su(5 ) multiplets , as in the case of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "let us consider a set of fields at the scale @xmath20 , with @xmath98 , which consists of multiplets of the gauge group @xmath92 .",
    "the condition  ( [ magcond ] ) for preserving unification changes , since it has now to take into account the additional vector superfields and has to be expressed in terms of the beta coefficients of the gauge couplings of the group @xmath92 .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath99 .",
    "we denote a ps multiplet by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 are the quantum numbers under su(4)@xmath102 , su(2)@xmath103 , su(2)@xmath5 respectively .",
    "the three ps gauge couplings @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 are matched to the sm ones at the ps breaking scale @xmath107 as follows : @xmath108 in terms of their beta function coefficients @xmath109,@xmath110 , @xmath111 , the condition  ( [ magcond ] ) becomes @xmath112 the contribution of mssm fields and ps gauge bosons is @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the pati - salam couplings do not unify if no extra matter is added , as condition  ( [ eq : magic - ps ] ) is not satisfied .",
    "it is however possible to restore unification by adding a single @xmath114 field at the ps breaking scale , which exactly cancels the contribution of the massive ps gauge bosons to the beta function coefficients .",
    "note that extra matter is also needed in order to break pati - salam to the sm .    if the field content below the ps scale is the mssm one , the classification given in section [ secmag ] can be maintained in these models simply by replacing @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ rdef ] ) with @xmath115 the formula ( [ scale ] ) for the gut scale is then still valid . a more general expression for the new unification scale valid whatever is the ( magic ) field content below @xmath93 is @xmath116 where @xmath117 are the mssm beta coefficients just below the ps scale .",
    "there are simple examples of magic fields that get their mass from ps - breaking vevs ( the fields getting vev are also assumed to be part of a unified or magic multiplet ) .",
    "one example leading to retarded unification is @xmath118 , with masses obtained from a @xmath119 vev along the @xmath87 direction .",
    "an example for fake unification is @xmath120 , with masses obtained from a @xmath121 vev proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "an example for fake unification , which also accounts for the pati - salam breaking , can be constructed by using the fields @xmath122,\\ ] ] and the superpotential @xmath123 where all the dimensionless couplings are of order 1 and the masses are of order @xmath124 .",
    "the interactions in the first line of  ( [ eq : ps - sp ] ) break ps to sm giving non - zero vevs to @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and their conjugates , while those in the second line give mass to all the other fields .",
    "note that in this case the pati - salam breaking scale corresponds to the gauge coupling unification scale , while so(10 ) is broken at an higher scale @xmath2 that is undetermined .",
    "as for the case @xmath128 , the magic condition can be written in terms of the beta coefficients @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 as @xmath131 the contribution of the mssm and the additional @xmath132 gauge bosons to the beta coefficients is @xmath133 and the expression for @xmath29 is the same as in the mssm ( see eq .",
    "( [ rdef ] ) ) , with @xmath134 .",
    "some examples which are related to the discussion in this section can be found in @xcite .",
    "an interesting application arises in unified theories with extra dimensions compactified on an orbifold .",
    "the advantages of such orbifold guts have been widely discussed in the literature and include easy breaking of the unified group by orbifold boundary conditions , a straightforward solution of the 2 - 3 splitting problem , and the suppression of dangerous baryon number violating dimension - five operators  @xcite . in these theories , fields living in the bulk of the extra dimension",
    "correspond to `` kaluza - klein '' ( kk ) towers of fields in the effective four - dimensional theory , whose masses are multiples of the compactification scale . because of the very mechanism of gut breaking by orbifolding , the kk fields with a given mass do not form full multiplets of the unified group . as a consequence ,",
    "the kk towers associated to the bulk fields introduce new thresholds affecting the prediction of @xmath9 . while such thresholds are often used to improve the agreement with data",
    "( if they are not too large ) , it is interesting to note that it is possible to get rid of such effects if the fields corresponding to a given kk mass form magic sets .    as an example , let us consider a 5d supersymmetric so(10 ) model on @xmath135 with a pati - salam brane and a so(10 ) brane ( see  @xcite for a description of such models ) .",
    "the vector fields @xmath136 live in the bulk together with a chiral hypermultiplet @xmath137 in the adjoint of so(10 ) , while the sm matter , the higgses and other fields live on the branes .",
    "the bulk fields can be classified in terms of their two orbifold parities @xmath138 .",
    "the orbifold boundary conditions are chosen such that the so(10 ) adjoints @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 split into their ps adjoint components and the orthogonal component , with orbifold parities defined as follows        s.  p.  martin and p.  ramond , phys .",
