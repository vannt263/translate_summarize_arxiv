    "spherical truncations of the coulomb interactions present in typical molecular models such as charmm  @xcite and amber  @xcite have long been used to keep computational cost in check .",
    "this cost in the simulation of large biomolecules is compounded by the use of explicit water models containing point charges to describe the hydrogen - bonding network and dielectric behavior of the solvating water molecules . since traditional particle - mesh ewald sum treatments of coulomb interactions",
    "do not scale well in massively parallel simulations , a computationally compelling case can be made for the use of spherical truncations  @xcite .",
    "however , spherical truncations have been shown to be clearly wrong when applied _ naively _ in a variety of nonuniform environments  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the use of short - ranged truncations of @xmath0 interactions is typically viewed as an unjustified approximation .",
    "there have been many attempts to place the use of spherical truncations of @xmath0 on a more solid theoretical footing , including site - site reaction field methods  @xcite , wolf summation  @xcite , and isotropic periodic summation  @xcite . despite this work ,",
    "the virtues and defects of spherical truncations of @xmath0 in various applications remains a subject of ongoing debate in the current literature  @xcite .",
    "our approach , local molecular field ( lmf ) theory  @xcite , uses an effective single particle potential to account for the averaged effects of the long - ranged interactions neglected in typical spherical truncations .",
    "it gives a theoretical basis for the use of simple truncations in some cases , and also provides a physically suggestive path for correction when such truncations fail .",
    "moreover , recent work has established a very efficient and accurate numerical method to determine the effective field in lmf theory using a simple linear response approach  @xcite .",
    "lmf theory for general nonuniform fluids is derived from the exact statistical mechanical yvon - born - green ( ybg ) hierarchy  @xcite by making two physically - motivated and well - founded approximations .",
    "these rely on the ability of well - chosen truncated potentials to yield accurate nearest - neighbor correlations and on the corresponding slowly - varying nature of the remaining long - ranged parts of the full potential  @xcite .",
    "previous work has shown that lmf theory corrects two well known failures of spherical truncations of @xmath0 interactions :    * simulations using lmf theory yield correct charge density profiles for water confined between two walls  @xcite and for ions confined between charged plates  @xcite , and * simple analytical corrections derived via lmf theory result in accurate energies and pressures for uniform ionic and molecular systems  @xcite treated with spherical truncations .    in this paper",
    "we employ lmf theory to illustrate and explain why spherical truncations of @xmath0 can often be applied very successfully for determining the structure and thermodynamics of _ uniform _ molecular systems .",
    "when lmf theory is applied to charge - charge interactions , all @xmath0 interactions are split into short and long ranged parts @xmath1  and @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 here @xmath2  is the electrostatic potential from a unit gaussian charge distribution with width @xmath4 , and @xmath1  corresponds to the potential from a point charge surrounded by a neutralizing gaussian charge distribution  @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath1  vanishes at distances @xmath5 much greater than the `` smoothing length '' @xmath4 and at small distances the force from @xmath1   approaches that of the bare point charge , so @xmath1  can be though of as a `` coulomb core potential '' .    in the simple strong coupling approximation ( sca ) to the full lmf theory , we assume that all effects from the long - ranged interactions due to @xmath2  may be neglected .",
    "thus the sca is in essence a spherical truncation where all @xmath0 interactions are replaced by the short - ranged @xmath1 , with @xmath4 setting the scale for the truncation distance . in section  [ sxn : scaresults ] , we emphasize the accuracy of the sca for uniform molecular systems , presenting results for spc / e water and acetonitrile ( ch@xmath6cn ) , including the effect of varying the range of the short - ranged truncation of @xmath0 as represented by @xmath4 in equation ( [ eq : coulombsplit ] ) .",
    "these results can be appreciated independent of the underlying lmf theory discussed in the rest of this paper .    furthermore , we demonstrate that spherical truncations can lead to highly accurate dipole - dipole correlations in uniform molecular systems .",
    "this surprising result is in sharp contrast to findings by nezbeda , who used a different molecular - based truncation scheme  @xcite , and we shall explain our success later using the full lmf theory",
    ". then in sections  [ sxn : lmfdiscussion ] and  [ sxn : scasuccess ] , we formulate lmf theory for bulk uniform site - site molecular fluids and discuss the success of these spherical truncations and the neglect of long - ranged interactions using the lmf theory framework for the simpler bulk water system .",
    "the form of the derived lmf equation and the necessary approximations make clear why spherical truncations can often give accurate structure in uniform systems , despite their invalidity in nonuniform systems .",
    "detailed derivations of lmf equations for various molecular models are discussed in complementary appendices .",
    "here we build on previous derivations of lmf theory for simple atomic fluids , and focus in particular on the derivation of the lmf equation for a uniform system of site - site molecules , described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 here @xmath8 describes the positions of all sites within a molecule @xmath9 connected by a generalized bonding potential @xmath10 , and @xmath11 describes the general pair interaction between two sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 on two different molecules @xmath9 and @xmath14 as insured by the @xmath15 term in equation ( [ eq : uniformu ] ) . in appendix",

    "[ fig : models ] .    for the water simulations , we present results for simulations of 1728 spc / e water molecules in a cubic box of side length 37.27   using the dlpoly2.16 simulation package  @xcite .",
    "the system of water molecules was equilibrated for 500 ps at 300 k using a berendsen thermostat with a time constant of 0.5 ps and a timestep of 1 fs . data was collected over the subsequent 1.5 ns .",
    "cutoff radii for the potential ranged from 9.5   up to 13.5   for varying choices of @xmath4 in @xmath1 .",
    "the sca simulations are compared to simulations using ewald summation with @xmath16  @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we have previously shown that the sca with a @xmath4 of 4.5    gives a highly accurate o - o pair correlation function for spc / e water  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : watercorrelations](a - c ) , we show the pair correlation functions for all site - site pairs using the sca with @xmath4 ranging from 3.0 to 6.0  . in all instances ,",

    "the curves for each @xmath4 choice are displaced by 0.2 in order to emphasize that all plots contain multiple choices of @xmath1  while yielding essentially the same correlation functions on the scale of the graph .",
    "these data illustrate the important point that @xmath4 is a consistency parameter rather than an empirical fitting parameter  @xcite .",
    "thus the mean field averaging leading to lmf theory become highly accurate for any choice of @xmath4 greater than a state dependent minimum value @xmath21 , typically of order a characteristic nearest neighbor distance . for spc / e",
    "water @xmath21 is about @xmath22 , the radius of the lennard - jones ( lj ) core on the water molecule .",
    "any smaller @xmath23 would clearly yield a short - ranged system that does not accurately describe the oxygen - hydrogen charge correlations on neighboring molecules that compete with the lj core repulsions in forming hydrogen bonds , and indeed poor agreement is found at smaller @xmath4 .",
    "we also carried out molecular dynamics simulations of bulk acetonitrile at two very different states , a high density liquid very near liquid - vapor coexistence at 298  k and a lower density system at 550  k. we used a six - site model with flexible bonds developed by nikitin and lyubartsev  @xcite in which intermolecular potential parameters have been optimized for better consistency with experiments . in order to simulate at appropriate bulk densities ,",
    "an initial configuration of 864 molecules in a cubic box is equilibrated for several hundred picoseconds ( ps ) in the npt ensemble using the nose - hoover thermostat and barostat until the volume has equilibrated .",
    "the low temperature system has a simulation box length of 42.2   .",
    "the dilute system at 550  k has a density one - third that of 298  k and is further equilibrated in the nvt ensemble for several hundred picoseconds .",
    "the cutoffs of the lennard - jones interactions were set to 15   . when the sca is employed , the cutoffs for @xmath1  were 15    for @xmath24   , 21    for @xmath25   , and 30    for @xmath26   . when ewald summation was employed as a benchmark , the cutoff for the real space interactions was set to 15   , and @xmath27  @xmath17 with @xmath28 .",
    "results for acetonitrile site - site pair correlation functions are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : acetonitrilecorrelationst298 ] and  [ fig : acetonitrilecorrelationst550 ] .",
    "these figures focus on the pair correlations at both 298  k and 550  k between a nitrogen site ( yn ) and all four molecular sites on another molecule .",
    "the remaining six intermolecular site - site pair correlations are described just as accurately , and are not displayed for brevity .",
    "for the high density room temperature system , both @xmath4 shown yield quite accurate results .",
    "note that the @xmath4 values are comparable to those used for water , despite the greater size of the acetonitrile molecule .",
    "very poor results ( not shown ) were obtained with use of a too small @xmath29    as would be expected .    for the higher temperature , lower density system , @xmath24    performs poorly and is not shown , @xmath25    is markedly improved , and only the largest @xmath4 of 8.5    yields high quality agreement with the ewald simulation .",
    "this is expected from simple scaling arguments since the typical nearest neighbor distance is larger ; multiplying @xmath30  for 298  k by the requisite increase in interparticle spacing at lower densities yields 6.5   .",
    "the need for a somewhat larger @xmath31 is likely a result of the increasing relevance of more extended conformations of these molecules at lower densities and higher temperatures .",
    "both the water and acetonitrile results show that spherical truncations are quite good in bulk fluids , given a sufficiently large truncation radius .",
    "this is phenomenologically well established in the literature .",
    "the strong agreement of all the acetonitrile site - site correlation functions , given a sufficiently large @xmath4 , suggests that the angular correlations between these molecules are also accurate , for otherwise many of the unusual functional forms would not be reproduced with fidelity .",
    "thus we also examine angular correlations for both water and acetonitrile .",
    "[ fig : watercorrelations](d ) shows the excellent agreement of dipole - dipole correlations in  water simulated using the sca with those correlations in the full ewald simulations .",
    "here we plot the average @xmath32 between water dipoles as a function of separation distance @xmath5 between the centers of mass of two water molecules .",
    "such good agreement is not a consequence of the relatively compact nature of the water molecule . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acetonitrileangular ] are plots of @xmath33 for the acetonitrile system at each temperature .",
    "we again find quite good agreement between the angular correlations in the full ewald system and our short - ranged systems .",
    "this agreement follows the trends found for the simpler site - site distribution functions , with a larger @xmath4 needed for the low density higher temperature state .",
    "we believe that the excellent agreement of the dipole - dipole correlations in these spherically truncated fluids is a direct consequence of the general validity of lmf theory and the accuracy of the strong coupling approximation in uniform environments , as we describe in the following section .",
    "nezbeda has previously reported poor results for dipole - dipole correlations in short - ranged systems where the determined @xmath19 were accurate  @xcite .",
    "the crux of the difficulties with his chosen cutoff scheme was defining these cutoffs on a molecular basis , rather than a site basis .",
    "this leads to neglected potentials which actually rapidly vary near the cutoff radius , counter to one of the important assumptions of theory as discussed in the next section .",
    "takahashi and coworkers  @xcite studied the effect of cutoff radii in the isotropic periodic sum approach on various properties of water and found for @xmath34 that deviations in this property were minimal and equivalent for cutoff radii greater than 16   .",
    "this cutoff radius for ips can be compared to the cutoff radius of 13.5    used for @xmath35    in this paper .",
    "we take their observed `` saturation '' in errors beyond a given cutoff radius as an indication that their spherically - truncated potential satisfies the necessary conditions for the validity of lmf theory .",
    "lmf theory for a general nonuniform system prescribes a mapping from the system of interest where all particles interact via their full intermolecular potentials in the presence of an external field to a `` mimic system '' where particles interact via short - ranged truncations of their intermolecular potentials but in the presence of a an effective or restructured field .",
    "the restructured field accounts for the effects of the long - ranged components of the intermolecular interactions using a mean field average . far from being a simplistic mean - field ansatz",
    ", lmf theory has been shown to be strongly rooted in statistical mechanical theory , and based on physically - motivated approximations that are well - justified for dense fluid systems .",
    "lmf theory for charged systems takes a particularly simple form when charges alone are treated via  theory using a single @xmath4 , where the results can be exactly re - expressed in terms of the total charge density and a restructured electrostatic potential .",
    "based on the splitting of @xmath0 defined in equation  ( [ eq : coulombsplit ] ) , each pair potential @xmath36 in equation  ( [ eq : uniformu ] ) may be decomposed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 contains all the non - electrostatic lennard - jones - like pair interactions as well as a @xmath1  contribution appropriately scaled by charge and the dielectric constant @xmath39 .",
    "the crucial feature of these two potentials @xmath1  and @xmath2  for the validity of lmf theory is that @xmath4 is chosen so that @xmath1  contains all relevant strong coulomb forces between nearest neighbors and that @xmath2  is consequently slowly - varying over the range of strongest correlations between those neighbors . a more careful statement of the relevant approximations",
    "may be found in appendix  [ app : simpleybgandlmf ] .",
    "previous work focused on nonuniformity such as confining walls , using the coulomb lmf equation  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41  results from the convolution of the fixed charge density with @xmath1 , and @xmath42 includes both the fixed and mobile charge densities .",
    "note that @xmath43  and @xmath42 are implicitly functionals of one another , so this is a self - consistent equation .",
    "since @xmath2  is the electrostatic potential arising from a gaussian charge density with width @xmath4 , equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralcoulombnonuniform ] ) suggests that the restructured external potential @xmath43  may be understood as an electrostatic potential containing the full impact of fixed charges and the gaussian - smoothed impact of mobile charges . in appendix",
    "[ app : simpleybgandlmf ] , we present a derivation of the lmf equation for site - site molecular models as used in previous papers .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralcoulombnonuniform ] ) is identical to that for mixtures of charged species  @xcite , and a derivation for small site - site molecular models requires only one further approximation , requiring that intramolecular correlations are well represented by the mimic system , a seemingly very reasonable requirement .",
    "the solution of equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralcoulombnonuniform ] ) has been shown to yield accurate structure for both ionic solutions  @xcite and molecular water  @xcite in nonuniform systems , and a simple linear response method for solving the above equation has been derived  @xcite , leading to fast and computationally efficient solutions of the lmf equation .",
    "site - site pair correlations in bulk fluids may be simply related to those arising from fixing a given site at the origin , thus allowing us to describe structure in uniform fluids from the nonuniform perspective of lmf theory in equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralcoulombnonuniform ] ) . as such , for bulk molecular fluids with spherically symmetric site - site interactions as considered here , we would expect that the general lmf equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralcoulombnonuniform ] ) in this case could then be written as @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the site fixed at the origin as indicated by the conditional notation @xmath46 on the left side of equation ( [ eq : lmfgeneralcoulombintext ] ) . in analogy with equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralcoulombnonuniform ] )",
    ", the first term is the short - ranged potential due to the only fixed charge in the system , the charge from site @xmath45 at the origin .",
    "the charge density @xmath47 is the total charge density in the nonuniform mimic system with @xmath48 again indicating the fixed site . in the case of these small site - site molecules",
    ", this total charge density may be decomposed as    * the intramolecular charge density arranged around the molecular site @xmath45 fixed at the origin including the site @xmath45 , denoted @xmath49 , and * the intermolecular charge density from other unconstrained mobile molecules induced by @xmath45 , denoted @xmath50 .    while only @xmath45 contributes to the @xmath41  in this equation , the intramolecular sites attached to the site @xmath45 fixed at the origin contribute directly to the total charge density @xmath51 and also implicitly but strongly impact the form of the intermolecular charge density @xmath52 based on their inclusion in the simulation of the mimic system .",
    "while the discussion above should make the form of equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralcoulombintext ] ) quite plausible , two further approximations are needed in addition to the three stated in appendix  [ app : simpleybgandlmf ] to carefully separate effects of intra- and intermolecular charges in this equation and to assess its accuracy for site - site molecular models .",
    "again , we employ the exact relationship between the pair distribution functions in a uniform fluid and the conditional singlet density profile due to a site fixed at the origin .",
    "the ybg hierarchy for site - site molecular systems with one site of one molecule fixed at the origin is derived in appendix  [ app : ybg ] .",
    "the derivation is quite interesting technically , since we use an external field to localize only a particular molecular site at the origin rather than to represent an entire fixed molecule , as is usually done .",
    "moreover , we derive first the ybg hierarchy for correlation functions between specific molecules rather than the usual generic correlation functions used in standard treatments . these features allows us to more easily disentangle contributions from intra- and intermolecular correlation functions . using this new ybg hierarchy",
    ", the derivation of lmf theory for a uniform fluid of site - site molecules then follows the traditional route , while requiring two new but very plausible approximations related to intramolecular correlations , as shown in appendix  [ app : lmfbulk ] .",
    "this provides a rigorous derivation of equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralcoulombintext ] ) .    towards the goal of understanding the accuracy of sca truncations in uniform fluids , we rewrite equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralcoulombintext ] ) in a way that focuses on the _ long - ranged _ contributions to @xmath43 , which we call @xmath53 : @xmath54 if @xmath55 then simulating with spherical truncations alone as in the sca will give very accurate results .",
    "this @xmath56 defined in equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralvrlongcoulombintext ] ) is seen to be the gaussian - smoothed electrostatic potential arising from the total charge density in the fluid induced by the charge from fixed site @xmath45 .",
    "this total charge density includes the single molecule charge distribution @xmath49 as well as contributions from other fully mobile molecules . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite , the restructured electrostatic potential @xmath57 induced by a general fixed charge distribution @xmath58 satisfies the single coulomb lmf equation given by the convolution of @xmath2  with @xmath59 , including contributions from both fixed and mobile charges , so equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralvrlongcoulombintext ] ) has exactly the form that would be expected .",
    "we specifically explore the meaning and consequences of the lmf equation for spc / e water , both because it has fewer sites than acetonitrile and also because it has a fixed geometry , thereby allowing for analytical determination of @xmath49 without simulation and independent of perturbations from other mobile molecules . for either hydrogen site , @xmath60 and for the oxygen site , @xmath61 where the charge densities have been spherically averaged about the site fixed at the origin . separating out the contribution of these intramolecular charge densities , the total @xmath62 in equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralvrlongcoulombintext ] )",
    "may be decomposed into intramolecular and intermolecular contributions as @xmath63 where the first term corresponds to the long - ranged interactions due to sites within the molecule with site @xmath45 at the origin .",
    "the success of sca shown in section  [ sxn : scaresults ] suggests that @xmath55 is a well - founded approximation . before utilizing the analytical charge densities above",
    ", we first explore an alternate formulation of lmf theory for site - site molecules which might seem initially fruitful .",
    "theoretical treatments of molecular models often involve fixing a given molecular orientation and considering the fluid response to this configuration . based on the splitting of @xmath0",
    ", the majority of the strong electrostatic potential energy and force will be included in the @xmath1  used as a pair potential in sca simulations .",
    "however , for any one orientation of a water molecule , the combined forces due to the @xmath2  on other oxygen and hydrogen sites will not be negligible , even though they are slowly - varying on the scale of @xmath4  for each individual site .    as one example of this ,",
    "the long - ranged electrostatic potential arising from a fixed orientation of a water molecule with o at the origin and the @xmath0 interactions replaced by @xmath2  with @xmath24    is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1waterorient ] . based on this single snapshot of the @xmath2  contributions due to intramolecular sites , neglect of these long - ranged forces in the sca would seem an ill - conceived approximation , and we might suppose that a @xmath43  depending on both intermolecular distance and relative molecular orientations would be required .",
    "however , looking at an individual orientation of the water molecule for long - ranged interactions fixes all three intramolecular charges and would be expected to generate a very different and larger density response than the single fixed molecular charge at the origin needed to determine radially - symmetric site - site correlation functions , as the equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralintrainterintext ] ) and appendices  [ app : ybg ] and  [ app : lmfbulk ] show .",
    "the first term in equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralintrainterintext ] ) may be determined analytically for spc / e water , and this is the first crucial step in understanding why the full @xmath56 will be small to good approximation in uniform systems . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1waterspherical ] , the spherically symmetric long - ranged potential from the first term , which we shall term @xmath64 is indeed much more slowly - varying than the orientation - dependent potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1waterorient ] . in this figure",
    ", we compare @xmath65 to both the @xmath1  due to either o or h fixed at the origin as well as the @xmath2  due simply to that site @xmath45 .    from these plots , we see that @xmath66 is substantially smaller in magnitude than either the electrostatic potential arising from a specific water molecular orientation or the potential due simply to the charge at the site @xmath45 we have fixed at the origin .",
    "therefore , we infer that the spherical truncations prescribed by theory and the associated mean - field averaging of long - ranged interactions will actually be even more effective in bulk molecular simulations than in a corresponding simulation of an ionic system with charges not bound into neutral molecules .",
    "again we emphasize that this spherical averaging is not an unfounded approximation , but that it arises rigorously from the statistical mechanics of molecular models interacting via site - site potentials .    the _ total _ electrostatic potential arising from the spherically - averaged intramolecular charge density will be exactly zero for all @xmath67 if oxygen is fixed at the origin or for all @xmath68 if hydrogen is fixed at the origin .",
    "thus it might seem counterintuitive that the corresponding @xmath66 is small but non - vanishing beyond this distance .",
    "however , the distinct treatments of the short - ranged and long - ranged parts of @xmath0 using gaussian convolutions in lmf theory require just such a nonzero potential .",
    "all the short - ranged parts of @xmath0 are treated explicitly via @xmath1  positioned around each site in the water molecule in order to represent local correlations ; the capture of these local correlations in the sca simulation is crucial . in tandem ,",
    "only the long - ranged components @xmath2  are spherically averaged about the fixed site @xmath45 in lmf theory , leading to a _ non - zero _ but slowly - varying and small magnitude potential @xmath69 outside the total potential cutoff . for the correlations between molecules ,",
    "the need for non - zero short - ranged site - site @xmath70 terms seems quite natural ; the need for similar short - ranged terms also holds for the far - less intuitively - obvious splitting of the ( exactly zero ) electrostatic potential between two charged plates  @xcite .    as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1waterspherical ] , @xmath65 is quite small and slowly - varying for spc / e water .",
    "however , while this may make the approximation that the total @xmath71 in equation  ( [ eq : lmfgeneralintrainterintext ] ) plausible , it certainly does not guarantee it .",
    "therefore , we also estimate @xmath72 by directly inserting the charge density resulting from the ewald simulation into the lmf equation .",
    "the sole care we take is in enforcing overall charge neutrality at the cutoff radius for the potential , as this is also the furthest radius at which @xmath19 is calculated .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vr1ewald ] , these potentials are also quite slowly - varying , lending strong credence to the approximation @xmath73 in determining structure .     based on charge densities from the simulations conducted using ewald summation.,width=288 ]    this approach for determining @xmath72 requires a full ewald simulation , contrary to the general philosophy of lmf theory , which seeks to use simulations only in the mimic system .",
    "thus strictly speaking we should self - consistently solve for @xmath56 based on charge densities from the short - ranged mimic system using the linear - response treatment developed in ref .",
    "but previous work has shown that the full lmf theory gives excellent agreement with the results of ewald simulations for water even in nonuniform environments , so this ewald determination should be very accurate .",
    "furthermore , care should be exercised with the @xmath74 component of any charge density used in the lmf equation  @xcite . however , charge densities obtained via ewald summation exhibit exponential screening and strictly enforce overall neutrality , thus easing the need for great caution in the treatment of the @xmath74 component .",
    "this simple estimate based on the ewald charge density certainly suffices to demonstrate that @xmath72 is small and slowly - varying in this case , and provides strong justification for the accuracy of the sca . in general",
    "we expect that quick estimates of @xmath43  using ewald charge densities when such simulations are computationally practical will be very useful in obtaining an accurate initial estimate of the final self - consistent @xmath43 , and one that will be almost certainly in the linear regime where the method of ref .  @xcite will be especially easy to use .    however , for these bulk fluids an accurate @xmath53  is neither necessary for determining the structure to the accuracy shown here nor for determining the thermodynamics of the fluid as shown in ref .",
    "provided that a sufficiently large @xmath4 is chosen , simple spherical truncations in simulations coupled with thermodynamic perturbation theory yield accurate structure , energies , and pressures . in the case of spc / e water ,",
    "structure might indicate that any @xmath75    is sufficiently large , but thermodynamics via perturbation theory showed that @xmath76    is required  @xcite .    in general",
    ", the choice of a sufficiently large @xmath4 is crucial for the accuracy of lmf theory . for the acetonitrile system at the higher temperature and lower density , inclusion of a self - consistent @xmath53 with @xmath24    gives a poor description of the structure of the acetonitrile system .",
    "however , since our simple scaling analysis suggests that @xmath77   , we do not expect lmf theory with the smaller @xmath4 to be able to correct this structure .",
    "for the acetonitrile systems at low and high temperature , just as for the water system at ambient temperatures , a sufficiently large @xmath4 yielded accurate results simply via sca .",
    "furthermore , the acetonitrile results already demonstrate that @xmath4 does not need to be on the scale of the entire molecule but rather on the scale of nearest neighbor correlations , as is expected from derivations of lmf theory . in appendix",
    "[ app : charmm ] , we discuss lmf theory for charmm - like molecules in order to better state the necessary conditions for choice of @xmath4 in much larger molecules .",
    "in this paper , we have demonstrated the accurate results possible using spherical truncations of @xmath0 interactions in simulations of uniform fluids .",
    "we show that these spherical truncations yield not only highly accurate pair correlation functions but also highly accurate dipole - dipole correlation functions . this good performance in bulk simulations of pair correlation functions",
    "was known ; however , a solid theoretical justification for the use of such spherical truncations in molecular systems has been lacking . in this paper",

    "the first , third , and fifth terms with curly brackets all may be neglected by approximations 1 - 3 as detailed in appendix  [ app : simpleybgandlmf ] .",
    "we now must employ two related approximations leading to cancellation of the intramolecular correlations functions .    *",
    "* approximation 4 * the product @xmath198 will be approximately zero .",
    "the logic here is virtually identical to that of approximation 2 . given rigid or even flexible bonds between intramolecular sites @xmath191 and @xmath45 we expect the matchup between densities in the short - ranged system and the full system to be even better at short distances , leading to an even stronger cancellation .",
    "* * approximation 5 * the product @xmath199 will also be approximately zero , for reasons similar to approximation 3 .",
    "in fact , the intramolecular conditional density profiles should be less sensitive to the presence of a site on another molecule for many configurations . at small separations ,",
    "the cancellation due to the slowly - varying nature of @xmath197  will still hold .",
    "thus we see that while more intramolecular terms must cancel in the derivation of the lmf equation , exactly the same line of logic is followed as in appendix  [ app : simpleybgandlmf ] . using ( [ eq : equaldensities ] ) and setting the first five integral terms to zero",
    "as justified in the previous discussion , we arrive at the site - site lmf equations for each combination of fixed site @xmath45 and mobile site @xmath13 : @xmath200 in the above equation , there are terms due to intramolecular sites as well as sites on other molecules . the portion due to intramolecular sites",
    "does not imply an action of @xmath201  on intramolecular sites but rather includes the _ effect _ of these intramolecular sites on sites of other molecules .",
    "this set of equations for each choice of @xmath13 and @xmath45 has the simplest form possible with a general separation of the pair interactions @xmath202 into short- and long - ranged parts .",
    "however , as discussed in detail in  @xcite , lmf theory takes a particularly simple and powerful form when it is applied only to coulomb interactions and all charges are separated using the same @xmath4 , as we do in this paper .",
    "charge densities rather than individual molecular site densities can then be naturally introduced , as shown below .",
    "furthermore , these new equations based on charge densities are not only simpler , but likely lead to an even stronger overall cancellation of terms than argued for each of the individual terms previously .    we may write the long - ranged coulomb part of the specific intermolecular pair interactions as @xmath203 and as before the short - ranged core interactions will be defined as @xmath204 and will encompass all -like interactions as well as the usual coulomb core @xmath1  terms . in particular ,",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : phitilde ] ) , the induced interaction from the fixed site can be written as @xmath205,\\ ] ] where @xmath206 contains all non - electrostatic ( usually lj ) pair interactions between sites @xmath13 and @xmath45 .",
    "the relevant spherically symmetric charge distribution arising from the constrained molecule with site @xmath45 fixed at the origin is given by @xmath207 for rigid molecules like spc / e water , @xmath49 can be determined in advance and expressed solely in terms of sums of @xmath208-functions as discussed in equations ( [ eq : hsite ] ) and ( [ eq : osite ] ) .    in general ,",
    "the total induced equilibrium charge density for a site @xmath45 fixed at the origin is then @xmath209 where the second term is the contribution to the charge density from the other unconstrained mobile molecules .    using ( [ eq : coulombu1 ] ) , we see equation  ( [ eq : gensitesite ] ) can now be written in the compact form @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the restructured electrostatic potential induced by the fixed site @xmath45 and the other associated intramolecular sites .",
    "this satisfies the site - site coulomb lmf equation @xmath212    we may also define a restructured potential @xmath56 containing only the long - ranged components of the potentials as @xmath213 this is the restructured gaussian - smoothed electrostatic potential induced by the fixed charge from the site @xmath45 at the origin , where @xmath42 is the total equilibrium charge density due to the fixed charge , the intramolecular charge density , as well as the fully mobile charges on other molecules .",
    "while the use of approximation 1 in previous derivations of lmf theory might suggest that our findings are invalid for larger molecules defined by charmm- or amber - like potentials , this is not the case .",
    "far less restrictive approximations than the equivalence of the whole molecule density functions may be derived by the usual postulates of a bonding potential form where only sites separated by 1 , 2 , or 3 consecutive bonds in a molecule may experience a special local bonding interaction .",
    "pairs of intramolecular sites with larger separations interact only through spherically symmetric ( usually coulomb and lj ) pair potentials .    rather than proceeding through logic identical to that found in the previous appendices , we instead outline the approximations necessary .",
    "then we briefly describe features of the lmf equations valid for such larger molecules in a general external field and in a uniform fluid .",
    "we seek to emphasize that lmf theory is equally valid for large molecular models typically employed , based on physically reasonable approximations .",
    "a separate appendix dealing with  equations and  equations for larger site - site molecules is necessary because in most simulation potentials , such as those defined by the charmm  @xcite and amber  @xcite parameter sets , the potential energy due to `` intermolecular '' interactions (  interactions and point charge interactions ) is not written as distinct summations over molecules and their intramolecular sites .",
    "rather the  and charge interaction contribution to @xmath84  is a sum over all sites separated by at least three bonds ( _ i.e. _  excluding atoms bonded or connected via angle bending ) .",
    "the expression for the partition function @xmath214 does not change , but @xmath84  does . specifically , we decompose the general @xmath215 into a set of bonds @xmath216 , bond angles @xmath217 , and bond dihedrals @xmath218 connecting appropriate sets of neighboring sites .",
    "we also introduce a bonding matrix @xmath219 for each species @xmath78 which is 1 if sites @xmath13 and @xmath12 can be connected by two consecutive bonds and 0 otherwise . with this notation",
    "we write @xmath220 @xmath84  written in this way is virtually identical to the small site - site molecular @xmath84  other than the decomposition of the bonding potentials and the allowance for intermolecular - like interactions between sufficiently separated sites within a single molecule .",
    "the first three @xmath221 terms are for bond vibrations , angle vibrations , and dihedral rotations of two bonds around a connecting bond . technically , these usually depend on only @xmath5 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 respectively , but we include positions for generality and for ease in taking gradients in deriving the appropriate ybg and lmf equations . these sums are understood to count sets of atoms connected via bond , angular , or torsional potentials only once .",
    "one complication for the amber force field is that non - bonded interactions are scaled down for 1 - 4 ( dihedral ) pairs .",
    "interactions for 1 - 4 pairs are divided by 2.0 and coulomb interactions are divided by 1.2",
    ". we will not address this complication , but it conceivably could be included in the @xmath224 formalism by introducing matrix elements accounting for these scalings . the new all - atom force field for charmm does not scale the coulomb interactions for 1 - 4 pairs .",
    "based on the form of the potential , it is quite logical that approximation  1 presented in appendix  [ app : simpleybgandlmf ] now becomes a series of approximations related to particles connected via bonding potentials .",
    "following the same path for lmf derivation in appendix  [ app : simpleybgandlmf ] , we find that the _ weaker _ conditions for accuracy replacing approximation 1 are :",

    "\\label{eq : torsionreq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these approximations are much more easily supported by mimic systems with reasonably small @xmath4 .",
    "this @xmath4  may have to be on the order of 1 - 4 distances since 1 - 4 pairs have coulomb interactions .",
    "in general though , we expect that  theory can be applied in standard biomolecular all - atomistic simulations with reasonable success with a @xmath4 spanning only a few bond lengths rather than an entire biomolecular radius , as suggested by our results for acetonitrile in the main text .",
    "provided that these approximations hold , we find exactly the same  equation for a nonuniform system .",
    "analysis for the bulk uniform fluid becomes more challenging as we must in principle consider all three - particle combinations of the three sites  @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the fixed site @xmath45  where @xmath12 and @xmath13 interact via their pair potential .",
    "this involves a wide range of permutations across different molecules , resulting in a larger number of terms that have to cancel in the derivation of the lmf equation , but again the final equation is essentially identical with the same underlying physical intuition .",
    "in fact , for these large molecules the attractiveness of treating solely charge - charge interactions via lmf theory becomes apparent .",
