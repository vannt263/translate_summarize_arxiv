    "interesting results obtained at the cern sps @xcite have heightened theoretical interest in @xmath4 production in relativistic heavy ion collisions . a new generation of models has appeared in which both dissociation and recombination of @xmath9 pairs play a significant role .",
    "there are now model predictions for rhic central collisions ranging from the almost complete disappearance of @xmath4 @xcite , to @xmath4 enhancement @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the first results from phenix on @xmath4 production at rhic .",
    "phenix @xcite detects electrons in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath10 , and muons in the range @xmath11 . in the central arms ,",
    "electrons are identified by matching charged particle tracks to energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter and rings in the ring imaging cherenkov detector . in the muon arms ,",
    "muon candidates are found by identifying roads in the muon identifier , and matching them to tracks found in the muon tracker .    during the 2001/2002 rhic run , phenix recorded data from both @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions . only the south muon arm was operational during that run .",
    "[ [ pp ] ] pp ~~    data from @xmath3 collisions were recorded for an integrated luminosity of 150 @xmath12 .",
    "the minimum bias interaction trigger for the present analysis was the beam - beam counter ( bbc ) , with at least one hit per arm .",
    "interaction rates for @xmath3 varied from about 5 @xmath13 to 30 @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath4 events were selected using level-1 triggers @xcite in coincidence with the minimum bias interaction trigger . the @xmath14 trigger used in this analysis ( about half of our @xmath3 data sample ) required that at least 700 mev be deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the @xmath15 trigger required at least one deep muon and one shallow muon in the muon identifier .",
    "the level-1 triggers allowed all @xmath4 events to be recorded at the highest interaction rates .",
    "after vertex cuts ( @xmath16 35 cm for @xmath17 and @xmath16 38 cm for @xmath18 ) and selection of good runs , about @xmath19 events were sampled for @xmath17 and @xmath20 events were sampled for @xmath18 .",
    "the muon arm data were subdivided into two rapidity bins .",
    "detector acceptance , level-1 trigger efficiency , and detector efficiency were estimated for a typical run using simulations of single @xmath4 decays with a realistic detector response .",
    "an average correction for run - to - run variations in detector active area was then determined from the azimuthal distribution of electrons / event for all runs used in the analysis .    for the @xmath17 case , two models of the transverse momentum distribution and a range of values for the mean p@xmath21 were used to establish the systematic uncertainty in the acceptance .",
    "this was necessary because the p@xmath21 distribution is not well defined by the data due to low statistics .",
    "this systematic uncertainty was estimated to be 10% .    for both the @xmath17 and @xmath18 cases ,",
    "pythia simulations were used to estimate the bbc trigger efficiency for inelastic @xmath3 events ( needed to calculate the total number of events ) , and to estimate the fraction of events containing a @xmath4 that fired the bbc trigger ( ie . the bbc trigger efficiency for @xmath4 detection ) .    for cross section calculations ,",
    "the rhic luminosity was assumed to have a systematic uncertainty of 20% in this preliminary analysis .",
    "this uncertainty is expected to be reduced considerably with more study .",
    "systematic errors were added in quadrature to produce an overall systematic uncertainty of 35% for @xmath22 and 29% for @xmath23 cross section data .",
    "data from @xmath2 collisions were recorded for an integrated luminosity of 24 @xmath24 .",
    "the minimum bias trigger used for @xmath2 collisions was a coincidence between the bbc ( 2 hits per arm ) and the zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) . at the highest luminosities , where only a fraction of the interactions could be recorded ,",
    "level-2 triggers @xcite were used to select @xmath4 events and minimum bias triggers were allocated only @xmath25 20% of the data bandwidth .",
    "interaction rates varied from about 100 @xmath26 to 1600 @xmath26 . at the end of the @xmath2 run ,",
    "the data samples from minimum bias triggers and level-2 triggers were approximately equal .    in the present preliminary analysis of the @xmath2 data ,",
    "only the @xmath0 data have been analyzed , and only minimum bias triggers were used . after applying a vertex cut of @xmath27 cm and selecting good runs , @xmath25 26 million events were analyzed .",
    "yields were extracted using 7 different procedures for yield and background estimation , to establish the systematic errors .",
    "the acceptance and detector efficiency were estimated using simulations of single @xmath4 decays with a realistic detector response .",
    "the minimum bias trigger is estimated @xcite to have unit efficiency for the most central 90% of interactions used in this analysis .",
    "the event centrality was estimated @xcite using the combined data from the bbc and zdc detectors .",
    "the data were separated into three centrality bins .",
    "the centrality dependence of the efficiency for offline @xmath4 reconstruction was estimated by embedding simulated single electrons into measured events and then taking the square of the single electron reconstruction efficiency as the @xmath4 reconstruction efficiency due to occupancy .    combining systematic errors quadratically produced an overall systematic uncertainty per centrality bin of 26% ( 0 - 20% ) 27%(20 - 40% ) and 26%(40 - 90% ) .",
    "the dielectron invariant mass spectrum from @xmath2 ( minimum bias ) is shown in fig . 1 , and that from @xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "3 shows the @xmath3 dimuon invariant mass spectrum .",

    "the total cross section was obtained by fitting both a gaussian and the pythia prediction for the shape of the rapidity distribution , using the parton distribution function grv94lo .",
    "both gave essentially the same integral , and the average of the two results for the total cross section is 3.8 @xmath16 0.6 ( stat ) @xmath16 1.3 ( sys ) @xmath8b .",
    "this value agrees well with the prediction of the color evaporation model @xcite .",
    "branching ratio times dn / dy scaled by n@xmath28 .",
    "the flat line is the best fit binary scaling value .",

    "the flat line is the best fit binary scaling value .",
    "the curve is a normal nuclear absorption model calculation @xcite.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the @xmath0 yield versus the number of participants ( n@xmath29 ) is shown in fig . 5 for the @xmath3 data and for the @xmath2 data divided into three centrality bins .",
    "rather limited conclusions can be drawn from the data in fig . 5 because of the large statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with this preliminary analysis .",
    "we have fitted a flat line to the data to see if the data are consistent with binary scaling . the best fit , shown in fig . 5 , has a confidence level of 16% based on the statistical uncertainties alone .",
    "thus the binary scaled @xmath4 yields probably trend down with increasing n@xmath29 , but that is not a strong statement .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "5 a comparison of the n@xmath29 dependence with a calculation from a simple normal nuclear absorption model assuming a 7.1 mb absorption cross section @xcite . here the confidence level is found to be 80% .",
    "however we wish to stress that the uncertainties in the data are too large to allow discrimination between any but the most extreme scenarios .",
    "we expect to approximately double the number of measured @xmath30 when we add level-2 triggered events to this analysis .",
    "we also hope to extract a comparable sample of @xmath15 data at forward rapidity from the existing data set .",
