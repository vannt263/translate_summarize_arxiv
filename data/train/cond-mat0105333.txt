    "the interest in crossover phenomena from the asymptotic to mean - field critical behavior in fluids has been described in detail in a recent review article by anisimov and sengers @xcite , which lists many references and where different theoretical approaches and also a comparison with some experiments are presented .",
    "the subject of a recent paper@xcite was a comparison between predictions for the crossover from monte carlo calculations@xcite and experimental data of simple fluids .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath3 above @xmath0 ( or compressibility ) and the liquid and vapor densities along the coexistence curve ( cxc ) for xe and @xmath1he were studied . from a fit of the data to the predicted curves ,",
    "the corresponding ginzburg numbers g could be estimated . for the cxc",
    ", the exit of the fluid from the critical regime into a background behavior could be clearly seen by a systematic departure from the predicted curve , well before the regime of mean - field critical behavior could be reached . for @xmath3 , the behavior of xe ,",
    "classical fluid \" , agreed well with predictions , but there were systematic differences for @xmath1he , and a qualitative discussion was made in terms of the interplay between quantum and critical fluctuations for this fluid .",
    "the purpose of this progress report is to extend the same analysis to the susceptibility @xmath4 data below @xmath0 for xe and @xmath1he , and also to give a status report on this program .",
    "after a background review , the susceptibility data of several experimental groups , namely along the critical isochore ( @xmath5 ) and along the liquid and the vapor side of the cxc ( @xmath6 ) , are discussed .",
    "comparison is made with curves from monte carlo calculations @xcite , and the corresponding ginzburg numbers g(@xmath4 ) are estimated .",
    "the internal consistency for the ginzburg numbers so obtained is checked by determining @xmath7 from the fit of data to a 2-term series expansion representing part of the curve obtained from the mc calculations . from the collection of ginzburg numbers obtained so far [ @xmath8,@xmath9 and @xmath10 ,",
    "their ratios are discussed in the light of predictions . in spite of the uncertainties in the g(@xmath4 ) below @xmath0 due sparsity of data and experimental scatter , and also in the g(@xmath3 ) for @xmath1he , some preliminary conclusions can be made .",
    "this progress report is to draw attention to the interest of such results , to their present incomplete understanding and to the great need of better data .",
    "we now list the properties discussed in this paper , and introduce the definitions of reduced temperature and density , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the coexistence curve is expressed by @xmath13\\]]where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the densities in the coexisting liquid and vapor phases , and at the critical point .",
    "furthermore @xmath16 = 0.326 is the critical exponent and the bracket includes the correction - to - scaling confluent singularity terms . here",
    "the @xmath17 s are amplitudes characteristic of the fluid , and @xmath18 = 0.52 , @xmath19 = 1.04 are the exponents obtained by wegner @xcite and by newman and riedel@xcite .    the susceptibility @xmath20 of the fluid , namely the analog of the susceptibility of a magnet , is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the isothermal compressibility and @xmath23 is the chemical potential .",
    "as discussed by sengers and levelt sengers@xcite , the 3-d lattice - gas model ( which corresponds to the 3-d ising model in magnets ) has properties that adequately describe real fluids .",
    "one particular aspect is that of symmetry in the @xmath24 plane .",
    "( in this respect , @xmath1he is the fluid that best conforms to this model . see appendix ) as a consequence , the derivative @xmath20 is a symmetric function of @xmath25 along an isotherm . hence below @xmath0 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath26 , where the susceptibilities are measured on both sides of the coexistence curve , and therefore we expect consistency between the data on both liquid and the vapor sides .",
    "here we introduce the reduced quantity @xmath27 , where the critical parameters have been listed in ref.@xcite . above @xmath0 and along the critical isochore , @xmath28 .",
    "similarly to eq.1 , the expansion for the susceptibility @xmath29 from the asymptotic critical regime is given by @xmath30 along the critical isochore and @xmath31 along the coexistence curve , respectively . here again the @xmath32 s are amplitudes characteristic of the fluid and @xmath33 = 1.24 is the critical exponent .",
    "the ratio @xmath34 for a given fluid has been calculated from series expansion by liu and fisher to be@xcite @xmath35this compares with the value of 4.82 obtained from the ratio @xmath36^{\\gamma-1}$ ] predicted from the parametric representation of the equation of state@xcite , where @xmath33 = 1.24 and @xmath16 = 0.327 were used .",
    "the most recent values of this ratio ( see @xcite ) are very close to 4.77 .",
    "predictions for the ratio of the amplitudes @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 will be presented below .      the ginzburg criterion and ginzburg number have been discussed in detail in the article by anisimov , kiselev , sengers and tang@xcite on the crossover approach to global critical phenomena in fluids .",
    "the ginzburg number @xmath7 is seen as a dimensionless temperature , obtained from the criterion @xmath40 which gives an estimate for the range of @xmath41 , where the classical critical theory is valid , this is where the fluctuation contribution is small . for fluids ,",
    "an order of magnitude estimate@xcite of @xmath7 leads to @xmath42 , and furthermore for a 3-d fluid , one finds @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the normalized molecular interaction range @xcite .",
    "hence the asymptotic critical behavior takes place for @xmath45 while the classical critical behavior is expected for @xmath46 .",
    "however as pointed out in ref.@xcite , in ordinary fluids the crossover is never completed in the critical domain ( @xmath47 ) since @xmath44 is of the same order as the distance between molecules .",
    "the monte carlo algorithm developed by luijten and bloete@xcite allows the full crossover region in 3-d ising models to be covered .",
    "the calculation then gives a curve of a given singular property @xmath48 = @xmath49 covering @xmath50 8 or more decades in @xmath51 , and is clearly more complete than the expansion series expressed in correction - to scaling terms of series .",
    "a simple check for the internal consistency in determining g can be made by the expected expansion in terms of the corrections - to - scaling confluent singularities as @xmath52\\]]where the amplitude @xmath53 is non - universal but where the numerical coefficients @xmath54 , and the exponent @xmath55 are universal for all fluids and characteristic of the property ( susceptibility , cxc etc ... ) .",
    "a fit of the curves @xmath48 = latexmath:[$f_i (    ( restricted to the region of @xmath51 where higher terms are negligible ) gives @xmath57 = 0.10 , @xmath58 = 0.65 , and @xmath59 = 0.23 .    of particular interest here",
    "is the calculation of the susceptibility @xmath20 , both below and above @xmath0 , represented in a very sensitive way by the plot @xcite of the effective exponent @xmath60 , which is given by the derivative @xmath61 in fig.1 , the plots of @xmath62 versus @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath31 , as obtained from monte carlo calculations , are presented side - by - side for comparison .",
    "the various symbols denote the successively larger values of the interaction range @xmath44 that were used to generate the master curve as the distance from @xmath0 is increased .",
    "the lines labeled  bk , bb and sf \" for @xmath64 and  app \" for @xmath31 are theoretical curves described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the slope of the exponent,@xmath65 , gives information on the crossover width between the asymptotic ising value of @xmath66 and the mean - field one @xmath67 .",
    "this width is shown to be much narrower for the region @xmath31 than for @xmath64 , as was pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "we shall see that this difference in crossover width is reflected in the data for @xmath1he .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]    the relations between the g s and the first wegner terms in the correction to scaling follow from eqs , 1 , 2 and 4 .",

    "@xmath18 = 0.5 , which will be used in the discussion of the data analysis .",

    "the numerical values for @xmath76 are obtained by fitting experimental data to a simple power law over the same range of @xmath69 where the fit to eq .",

    "we briefly comment on the various measurements and their respective scatter .",
    "as will be seen below , the @xmath20 data for @xmath64 have an appreciably higher accuracy than those below @xmath0 . in the light scattering measurements",
    ", this might possibly be due to the added difficulty of sending the laser beam alternatively into the superposed liquid and vapor phases of a cell with a small height , and where the meniscus will become concave as @xmath0 is approached , because of the decreasing surface tension .",

    "the coexistence curve data were fitted to eq.1 @xcite . on the average",
    "these determinations were made with an uncertainty of @xmath96 .",
    "by contrast in the experiments with @xmath1he without optical access , the uncertainty in @xmath0 is more important .",
    "it is probably smallest in the experiments by pittman @xcite where @xmath0 was determined principally from measurements below @xmath0 ( coexistence curve ) , and where @xmath0 was obtained from a fit of eq.1 , as described in that paper . here",
    "the claimed uncertainty is @xmath97 . in the older measurements of @xmath20 from isotherms by wallace and meyer@xcite , the choice of @xmath0 was obtained by extrapolation of both coexistence curve data and compressibility data , and based on a simple power law with effective exponents .",
    "the uncertainty was claimed to be @xmath98 .",
    "the use of this power law led to a systematic error in @xmath0 which was evidenced by deviations from the compressibility data of ref.@xcite , as shown in fig.1 of @xcite . in the @xmath20 measurements by chase and zimmerman@xcite , also from isotherms ,",

    "the data fits for @xmath38 and @xmath39 in @xmath1he and for @xmath39 in xe ( with very scant data and appreciable scatter close to @xmath0 ) were made by setting the higher terms in eq . 1 to zero .",
    "to this purpose , the fitting was restricted to the range @xmath107 , where presumably the higher terms in eqs . 1 , 2 ( and therefore also in eq .",
    "4 ) can be neglected . because of the strong correlation between the amplitudes in the data fitting procedure to eqs 1 and 2 , an uncertainty of only say o(@xmath1085% ) in @xmath109 can produce a much larger one of o(@xmath8650% ) in @xmath73 . for the cxc of @xmath1he and xe , and for @xmath38 of xe , the amplitudes listed in refs@xcite were used .",
