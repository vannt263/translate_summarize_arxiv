    "in this note we ask a common psychological question and provide a physics answer :  looking into a mirror can one get entangled with one s image ? according to storybooks the answer for the evil queen q seems to be yes , a case of typical royal narcissism .",
    "we want to find out the answer from physical considerations : here entanglement refers to quantum entanglement , and _ autangle _ means self - entanglement , here referring to the entanglement of a real physical object q with its mirror image .",
    "we hasten to add that since the image is not a physical object one can not define , let alone calculate , the entanglement between a physical object and an unphysical construct . however , there exists entanglement between an oscillator and a quantum field , and we can ask how this is altered if a mirror is present .",
    "a perfectly reflecting mirror imposes dirichlet boundary conditions on the field along the mirror surface , restricting its existence to a half space .",
    "these are well - defined problems , belonging to the broader inquiry into the effects of boundaries and topology on the quantum field and on quantum entanglement of objects , oscillators and mirrors , coexisting with and/or mediated by the quantum field .",
    "in fact , they bear on issues of importance to quantum information and macroscopic quantum phenomena . amongst research problems of current interest , we mention : 1 ) entanglement between two two - level ( 2la ) atoms via a common quantum field already shows diverse quantum entanglement dynamics behavior @xcite , ranging from sudden death , touch of death , revival to staying always alive , and features such as dynamical generation , protection , and transfer of entanglement between subsystems",
    ". model studies of oscillator - field entanglement with experimental ventures have been carried out @xcite as well as oscillator - field entanglement in conjunction with measurements in ligo detectors @xcite , the latter also serving as preparatory studies for mirror - field superposition @xcite in macroscopic quantum phenomena .",
    "2 ) entanglement not only changes in time but it also depends on spatial separation as shown in model studies for 2las @xcite and harmonic oscillators @xcite interacting with a common quantum field .",
    "these results are of both theoretical interest in understanding what quantum nonlocality means , and practical value , such as for the design of quantum gates and applications to quantum teleportation .",
    "extending these findings to two and three dimensional systems would enable one to define quantum entanglement domains @xcite and geometric effects of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the former refers to the effective domain on a surface or body where entanglement is induced by the presence of an oscillator , not unlike the induced surface charge density on a conductor or dielectric plate .",
    "the latter refers to specific geometric patterns in the arrangements of oscillators where their entanglement strength can be maximized .",
    "now , returning to the problem under study , one may wonder , is it really necessary to carry out such a serious calculation in order to answer a simple query posed at the beginning : is there entanglement between the queen and her image ?",
    "the answer is yes , both to the query and to the necessity of a bona fide calculation . as we cautioned _",
    "ab initio _ , an image is not a physical object .",
    "thus we try to avoid invoking an image in this calculation so that no unphysical assumptions or intuition are brought in unnecessarily or unknowingly in the derivations .",
    "however , at the end , by inspecting the results from the oscillator - field ( under mirror reflection ) entanglement we see that one can use the notion of an image to describe the process , in fact , come up with a simple qualitative explanation of how it depends on distance .    the paper is organized as follows : in section .",
    "ii we set up the problem and derive a formal set of equations for the heisenberg operators of the oscillator s internal degrees of freedom and the quantum field .",
    "we impose the boundary conditions introduced by the presence of the mirror and explain how the commutation relations are altered .",
    "next we calculate the retarded and hadamard green functions of the altered field configurations and derive a quantum langevin equation for @xmath0 including the back - reaction of the altered field .",
    "we seek solutions to this equation at late times and calculate the covariance matrix of the oscillator s canonical variables at late times when the combined system is in a stationary state .",
    "details are contained in appendix [ latecv ] . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the linear entropy and the von - neumann entropy as measures of quantum entanglement and calculate the early - time dynamics of entanglement between the oscillator and the field in the oscillator - mirror setup described above .",
    "we obtain plots of how the entanglement between the oscillator and field in the half space with the mirror reflection evolves with time , depending on the distance between the oscillator and the mirror .",
    "finally in the discussions section we explain in what sense can one describe this situation in terms of entanglement of the oscillator with its mirror image and why it decreases as the oscillator moves closer to the mirror , a somewhat counterintuitive finding .",
    "we also compare this situation with the case of two inertial oscillators in free space ( calculations placed in appendix [ w2iho ] ) and explain their physical differences .",
    "as described in the introduction , the gist of the matter for this problem is to quantify the change in some entanglement measure between the oscillator and the field with and without the presence of a mirror .",
    "technically our calculation involves two parts : 1 ) find the back - reaction of the field configuration altered by the mirror on the oscillator .",
    "2 ) find the correlation functions of the resultant oscillator s canonical variables including the field s influences .",
    "thus our target is the covariance matrix for the oscillator which incorporates all back reactions from the quantum field .",
    "we work with the heisenberg equations of motion which efficiently provides the oscillator s field - influenced dynamics .",
    "we can then find the oscillator s late time behavior and quantify it s entanglement with the modified field .",
    "consider an oscillator located at position @xmath1 at a vertical distance of @xmath2 from the mirror plane at @xmath3 .",
    "the total action of the system describing this oscillator with internal degree of freedom @xmath4 interacting linearly with a massless scalar field confined to the half space defined by @xmath5 is given by : @xmath6=\\frac{1}{2}m_{q}\\int dt\\ ( \\dot{q}^{2}-\\omega^{2}q^{2})+\\frac{1}{2}\\int dt\\int_{x_{3}>0}d^{3}x\\ \\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi+\\lambda_{q}\\int dt\\ q(t)\\phi({\\bf x}_q^{},t).\\label{eq : action_half}\\ ] ] due to the linearity of our system the equations of motion for heisenberg operators ( carrying hats ) have the same form as the equations for the corresponding classical variables : @xmath7 equation ( [ fieldeqn ] ) specifies the dirichlet boundary ( dbc ) conditions imposed on the field where the mirror surface is located , namely , in the @xmath8 plane and @xmath9 . to obtain the back - reaction of the field on the oscillator we first solve ( [ fieldeqn ] ) and",
    "then plug the solution into ( [ atomeqn ] ) .",
    "the solution for @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the homogeneous solution to equation ( [ fieldeqn ] ) which describes the dynamics of the source - free field ( without @xmath4 ) in the presence of the mirror and @xmath13 is the retarded green s function for the field . plugging the solution for the field operator into the equation of motion for the oscillator we obtain the following equation governing the dynamics of the oscillator with the effects of the field",
    "already incorporated .",
    "this is what we mean by the ` field - influenced ' dynamics of the oscillator @xmath14    as will be explained in further detail later the term containing the retarded green s function describes how the oscillator transfers energy to the field and the right hand side acts similarly to a langevin forcing term describing how quantum field fluctuations drive the oscillator .      in order to solve the equation of motion for the oscillator ( [ fi - atomeqn ] ) we need to know the field operators defined in the half space . following this procedure we first write down the free field operator @xmath15 which satisfies the klein - gordon equation and vanishes in the @xmath8 plane , @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "notice that the normalization factor is different for field in half space .",

    "in @xcite the dynamics of the entanglement between two inertial oscillators with identical couplings to a common massless scalar field was investigated and it exhibited several interesting features .",
    "there are roughly three temporal regimes if the two oscillators are properly separated and weakly coupled to the field .",
    "the first regime is at early time , up to @xmath25 when accumulated effects of field - mediated mutual influences , which manifest themselves in the field s retarded propogators , between the oscillators are still weak and the reduced dynamics of the oscillators are dominated by influences of vacuum fluctuations of the field .",
    "as the effects of field - mediated mutual influences between the oscillators gradually gain strength , the system will enter an intermediate regime in which the oscillators reduced dynamics become quite complicated . in the late - time limit ,",
    "the oscillator approaches a time - stationary state .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it was shown that at early time , after causal contact has been established between two detectors , an oscillatory pattern of entanglement emerges which varies with the distance between the oscillators .",
    "this is not due to mutual influences since in the weak coupling limit the mutual influence effect is always weak compared to effect of vacuum fluctuation .    for our model",
    ", we expect a similar division into three temporal regimes . here in this section",
    "we study the early time behavior of our model , assuming that initially both the oscillator and the field are in their ground states and are uncorrelated .",
    "we show that the oscillator - field entanglement also develops an oscillatory pattern which varies with the distance between the oscillator and the mirror . at a given instant of time ,",
    "the oscillator - field entanglement exhibits spatial oscillations characterized by frequency @xmath26 ( we adopt the convention @xmath27 ) . additionally , we find that the growth rate at which the oscillator - field become entangled oscillates as a function of the oscillator - mirror spacing .",
    "in our setup , the oscillator and the field together form a closed quantum system which undergoes unitary evolution .",
    "since the initial state of the total system is gaussian and the action is quadratic , the reduced quantum state of the oscillator at any time will remain gaussian . for such systems the amount of bipartite entanglement between the oscillator and the field can be quantified by the linear entropy of the oscillator s reduced density matrix , which takes on values different from @xmath28 when the oscillator and field are entangled . here",
    "the linear entropy is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the purity of the oscillator s reduced quantum state . here for our general mixed gaussian state , the purity is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "mathematically we know that @xmath34 is always less than or equal to 1 .",
    "smaller purity means the reduced density matrix of the oscillator is less pure , and correspondingly the oscillator is more entangled with the field .",
    "another measure of bipartite entanglement between the oscillator and the field is von neumann entropy , which for a single - mode mixed gaussian state is @xmath35 and is a monotonically increasing function of the linear entropy .",
    "both @xmath36 and @xmath37 yield the same characterization of mixedness and are equivalent as entanglement measures in the case of a single - mode mixed gaussian state .",
    "we perform the following mode decompositions for heisenberg operators of the oscillator @xmath38 and the field @xmath39 with respect to the creation and annihilation operators of the oscillator @xmath40 and those of the field @xmath41 :    @xmath42+\\int_{k_{3}>0}\\frac{d^{3}k}{\\sqrt{2\\pi^{3}}}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}}\\left[q_{+}(t,{\\bf k})\\hat{b}_{{\\bf k}}+q_{-}(t,{\\bf k})\\hat{b}_{{\\bf k}}^{\\dagger}\\right],\\\\ \\hat{\\phi}(x ) & = & \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega_{r}}}\\left[f_{\\rm a}(x)\\hat{a}+f_{\\rm a}^{*}(x)\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\right]+\\int_{k_{3}>0}\\frac{d^{3}k}{\\sqrt{2\\pi^{3}}}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\omega}}\\left[f_{+}(x;{\\bf { \\bf",

    "ths process contributes a correction of order @xmath166 , according to @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "on the other hand , as stated in appendix [ w2iho ] , in the case of two inertial oscillators with opposite coupling constant , the lowest order correction to self - correlators corresponds to the following physical process : oscillator a emits a quanta , which interacts with oscillator b , then the back reaction from oscillator b to the field echoes back and interacts with oscillator a. the contribution of this process is of order @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , the influence of the mirror and a real image oscillator correspond to different physical processes and are of different orders in the coupling constant .",
    "we began with a rather naive question about whether quantum entanglement can exist between a physical object ( the evil queen q modeled by a harmonic oscillator ) with her mirror image .",
    "the immediate answer from a formalist could be no , because an image is not a physical object and only physical quantum objects can get entangled .",
    "what we really wanted to find out in this inquiry is the effect of boundaries on quantum entanglement , as that between an atom and its trap or cavity surface .",
    "our calculation leading to an answer to this query took on three steps 1 ) entanglement exists between an oscillator and a quantum field ; 2 ) the presence of a mirror alters the field configuration , namely , a perfectly reflecting mirror imposes a dirichlet boundary conditions on the field along the mirror surface ; 3 ) the symmetry in the expression we derived for the entanglement between the oscillator and the field in half space with dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the mirror surface suggests that it is as if the oscillator was entangled with its image located at distance @xmath2 on the other side of the mirror .",
    "we expound the meaning of these statements with the following observations : a ) this entanglement is different both from that of an oscillator with the quantum field in free space , i.e. , without a mirror , and that between two physical oscillators at distance @xmath76 apart .",
    "b ) the statement of `` entanglement between an oscillator with its image '' should always be understood as `` the entanglement of an oscillator with the quantum field in half space under dirichlet boundary conditions '' .",
    "c ) note that this substitute description works only for dirichlet conditions , it fails if a neumann condition was imposed on the boundary instead .    developing this theme further",
    ", one can see more clearly which parties are being entangled if one considers a microscopic model of a mirror such as the one considered by galley et al @xcite , where the mirror s internal degrees of freedom is modeled by an oscillator ( called mirosc ) with very light mass ( whereby the quantum fluctuations of the mirrors internal degrees of freedom will be suppressed ) . with this setup we could then consider three physical degrees of freedom : the oscillator , the field and the mirosc ( the light degrees of freedom making up the mirror ) .",
    "if one first considers the interaction between the mirosc and the field , this would yield in the zero mirosc mass or infinite reflectivity limit the modified field configuration derived here . then",
    "from the covariance matrix of the oscillator one can derive the entanglement between the oscillator and the modified field . with a microphysical model of the mirror one can calculate how the dynamics of the mirosc is altered while interacting with the field , how the field is modified , and how the oscillator is entangled with the modified field .",
    "the advantage of this is that one can see clearly how this entanglement can be interpreted as the entanglement between the oscillator and the mirosc ( for an example of the successive levels of coarse - graining , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this reminds us of a similar procedure in electrostatics , namely , how the force between a charge and the induced surface charge density on a conducting plate can be calculated using the image charge method .",
    "another observation using elementary physics of wave reflection upon a mirror is the following : since the field configuration is at the base of inquires into boundary effects on the oscillator field entanglement , the behavior of reflected waves could provide some useful guide in building up our intuition on quantum entanglement in this setting . instead of a mirror with perfect reflectivity we can think of two adjoining dielectric media 1 , 2 with dielectric coefficients @xmath170 ( the mirror situation considered above corresponds to the case where @xmath171 is the vacuum @xmath172 , much smaller than @xmath173 ) . for waves propagating from a soft medium 1 to a hard medium 2",
    ", the reflected wave is inverted .",
    "this show up in the reflected field configuration carrying an opposite sign from the original field configuration , thus partially canceling it .",
    "this cancelation effect is more severe near the mirror surface and hence we see the decrease of entanglement as the oscillator gets closer to the mirror . if this reasoning is correct then in the reverse situation , if the queen were a water nymph living in a lake ( medium 2 ) , looking up at the sky ( the air is medium 1 , where we have assumed @xmath174 ) . as waves from the heavy medium entering a light medium",
    "will be reflected at the interface with a positive amplitude , the entanglement would increase as the nymph comes up close to the water - air surface .",
    "thus we can add a fourth factor , 4 ) that of parity in reflection .",
    "fairy tales aside , when the experimental techniques improve to the extent that one can measure the quantum entanglement between an atom and the trap surface these results could be of some practical value .",
    "our next paper @xcite will treat the quantum entanglement between an atom and a dielectric medium .",
    "we will adopt the influence functional method recently used for the treatment of fluctuation forces between an atom and a dielectric medium @xcite . as a small corollary we will be able to check on the correctness of the above qualitative argument based on symmetry and parity considerations .",
    "later papers in this series will address entanglement domain and entanglement pattern , and a parallel series on quantum entanglement in topologically non - trivial spaces starting with @xmath175 @xcite , which can be applied to atoms in a toroidal trap .",
