    "<S> the reaction @xmath0 has been studied with gams-2000 spectrometer in the secondary 38 gev / c @xmath1-beam of the ihep u-70 accelerator . </S>",
    "<S> partial wave analysis of the reaction has been performed in the @xmath2 mass range up to 1200 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-meson is seen as a sharp peak in s - wave . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath3 production cross section has been studied . </S>",
    "<S> dominant production of the @xmath3 at a small transfer momentum @xmath4 confirms the hypothesis of achasov and shestakov about significant contribution of the @xmath5 exchange ( @xmath6 ) in the mechanism of @xmath3 meson production in @xmath4-channel of the reaction .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-meson is quite peculiar object in meson spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> more than two decades of extensive experimental and theoretical studies of the @xmath7 meson have been undertaken . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless its nature is still not completely clear , see for example @xcite .    in the present talk </S>",
    "<S> the results on the @xmath3-meson production in the charge exchange reaction @xmath8 at 38 gev / c are presented for @xmath9 final states of the @xmath2-system . </S>",
    "<S> the data were collected with the gams-2000 multiphoton spectrometer in the secondary @xmath1-beam of the u-70 accelerator of ihep . in total @xmath10 events of reaction ( 1 ) were collected . </S>",
    "<S> further details of the experiment as well as    the data treatment procedures can be found elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the mass spectra of the @xmath2-systems produced in reaction ( 1 ) at are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency corrected spectrum at is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency was calculated by monte - carlo method , details see elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two peaks , corresponding to the @xmath3 and @xmath11 mesons , are clearly seen in both figures , but their intensities are different . while at @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a , solid line , the @xmath11-meson dominates in the spectrum , at @xmath13 , the intensities of both peaks are actually similar , fig .  1b , i.e. the production mechanisms of these mesons in reaction ( 1 ) are different .    in the @xmath11 meson production the natural spin - parity exchanges ( mainly @xmath14-exchange ) </S>",
    "<S> dominate in the @xmath4-channel of the reaction @xcite , that leads to a suppression of the @xmath15 production at @xmath16 @xcite . as for the @xmath3 meson production </S>",
    "<S> the only unnatural exchanges are allowed in the @xmath4-channel . moreover , due to the features of reaction ( 1 ) one should expect a significant contribution of the @xmath5 exchange ( @xmath6 ) usually hidden in other reactions , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the last exchange leads to a non - vanishing differential cross section of the @xmath3 production in reaction ( 1 ) at small @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a study of the @xmath3 differential cross section is also important for understanding of the status of the @xmath5 states .    for selection of the @xmath3 events a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of the @xmath2 system </S>",
    "<S> produced in reaction ( 1 ) has been performed in 17.5 @xmath17 mass bins in the range up to 1200 mev taking into account @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 waves . </S>",
    "<S> the pwa procedure as well as a solution of the ambiguity problem are described elsewhere @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> it would be useful to mention that in the pwa model with @xmath18 and @xmath22 waves there are only two non - trivial solutions . </S>",
    "<S> both solutions at @xmath23 are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical solution can be identified as that one with the resonance peak in @xmath18-wave , solid line in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the @xmath3 resonance @xmath24    were obtained by fitting the @xmath18-wave intensity in the physical solution to the uncoherent sum of breit - wigner function and polynomial background , fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> actually the same resonance parameters were obtained if flatte s @xcite or achasov s @xcite formulae where used for parameterization of the @xmath3 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the number of events in the @xmath3 peak normalized for the cross section of the @xmath25 production in @xmath26 wave of reaction ( 1 ) was used for the cross section determination of the @xmath3-meson , see @xcite : @xmath27 to obtain the @xmath4-dependence of the @xmath3 production in reaction ( 1 ) , the similar analysis was performed in several @xmath4-intervals : @xmath28 $ ] , @xmath29 $ ] , @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath32 $ ] , @xmath33 $ ] @xmath34 , and in each @xmath4-interval the ratio of the @xmath7 event number to the total event number @xmath35 was determined for @xmath36 $ ] mev @xmath2-mass interval . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio was further approximated by an exponential function of @xmath4 . at the final stage of the analysis the pwa </S>",
    "<S> was performed in @xmath36 $ ] mev mass interval independently in 20 @xmath37 bins of the transverse momentum squared . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 event numbers in the @xmath4-bins were obtained then as the @xmath18-wave intensities corrected for corresponding @xmath35-factors , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the obtained @xmath4-distribution was fitted by functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 corresponding to @xmath40 and @xmath5 exchange respectively in the @xmath4-channel of reaction ( 1 ) @xcite , as well as by a sum of both functions . </S>",
    "<S> the fit by the first function only ( @xmath40 exchange ) is quite unsatisfactory ( @xmath41 ) due to the peak at @xmath42 in the @xmath4-distribution , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the second function ( solid line , @xmath43 ) and the sum of both functions ( dashed line , @xmath44 ) fit the measured differential distribution equally well , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude therefore that the @xmath5 exchange is quite necessary for description of the differential cross section of the @xmath3-meson production in reaction ( 1 ) in agreement with paper @xcite . </S>"
