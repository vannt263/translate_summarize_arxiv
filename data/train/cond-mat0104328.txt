    "among the anomalous normal state transport properties observed in high temperature superconductors , the temperature dependence of the hall constant is probably one of the most striking : it displays a behavior which is totally different from the one observed in simple metals .",
    "indeed , it is generally observed , in particular in reba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( re rare earth ) compounds , that the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient , @xmath13 , goes as @xmath14 over a wide temperature range and presents an ill - understood peak above @xmath12 , whereas the cotangent of the hall angle ( @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the longitudinal and hall resistivity ) varies as @xmath8 over a wide temperature range .",
    "one way to analyze the temperature dependence of the hall effect is to consider two different relaxation rates .",
    "experimental reports @xcite , showing that the cotangent of the hall angle obeys a @xmath8 law even if @xmath18 or @xmath19 are strongly nonlinear suggest that the cotangent of the hall angle is a function of a single relaxation rate , @xmath20 , whereas the resistivity @xmath16 would be related to another relaxation rate @xmath21 .",
    "other scenarios based on a temperature dependent carrier concentration@xcite or on a scattering time that depends on the fermi surface location@xcite have been proposed . when considering two relaxation rates , the hall constant @xmath11 depends on both @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath8 temperature dependence of the cotangent of the hall angle , @xmath25 , has been theoretically predicted @xcite , and observed experimentally in many systems @xcite . in the approach proposed by anderson",
    "@xcite the two scattering rates reflect spin and charge separation with the hall angle being directly related to the spinon relaxation rate . in this view",
    ", magnetic impurities bring another scattering channel for the spinons and thus directly affect the behavior of the hall angle as first observed experimentally by t. r. chien , z. z. wang and n. p. ong @xcite .",
    "recent experimental results@xcite and theoretical ideas on the nature of the pseudogap @xcite and its influence on hall measurements @xcite , the possible presence of charge inhomogeneities @xcite , or the presence of vortex like excitations in the pseudogap phase @xcite have changed our view of the normal state . in this paper , we revisit the question of the hall effect by measuring the hall constant and the hall angle in the pseudogap phase of epitaxial underdoped gdba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 films .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in the context of the recent findings mentioned above .",
    "a series of gdba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 thin films were grown by off - axis magnetron sputtering on ( 100 ) srtio@xmath1 substrates .",
    "the temperature of the substrates was typically @xmath26 , and the @xmath27 sputtering pressure @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite the oxygen content in the films was changed by varying the oxygen pressure during the cooling procedure @xcite .",
    "the structural crystalline quality of the films was checked by x - ray diffraction analysis . @xmath30 and",
    "phi scans indicate an epitaxial growth with the @xmath31 axis oriented perpendicular to the substrate surface .",
    "low angle x - ray reflectivity oscillations as well as finite size effects around the 001 peaks allow determination of the individual sample thickness , which was varied from @xmath32 to @xmath33 in this study . to prevent degradation during the lithographic processes ,",
    "the films were protected by the subsequent in - situ deposition of an amorphous insulating layer .",
    "all the samples were photolithographically patterned using ion milling with a @xmath34 bridge wide .",
    "the relatively low thickness of the films allowed us to increase the measured voltages and to reduce the noise of the measurements .",
    "the @xmath35 hall voltage was measured using a three voltage contact technique and by adjusting the hall voltage to zero in zero magnetic field . at each temperature , the hall voltage was measured by sweeping the magnetic field between @xmath36 and @xmath37 tesla . during each measurement , the temperature , measured with a cernox resistance , whose magnetoresistance is negligibly small , was stable within @xmath38 @xmath39 .",

    "[ figure1 ] the curves correspond to films with critical temperatures of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as can be seen , @xmath12 [ ref .",
    "] scales with the inverse hall coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath3 depends on the temperature , the relation between the doping level and @xmath3 is not straightforward . here , we will simply use , as others @xcite , the value of @xmath3 at 100 @xmath46 as a parameter related to the doping level .",
    "we find that the @xmath12 versus @xmath47 curve obtained is in good agreement with yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals data@xcite .",
    "this observation is consistent with a @xmath12 reduction and a change in doping in these thin films essentially related to a change in oxygen content . in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] the highest @xmath12 sample has a resistivity which is typically twice the value found in optimally doped thin films @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath47 for this same sample is slightly less than half the value found in optimally doped thin films @xcite , implying that , in this thickness range , our films are not fully oxidized @xcite .",
    "one can also notice on fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] that the maximum in @xmath11 occurs in the normal state around @xmath10 for each sample and does not seem to be related to the @xmath12 of the sample .",

    "[ figure2 ] the temperature dependence of @xmath3 is shown for four representative samples .",

    "figure [ figure3 ] shows for four selected samples @xmath49 and @xmath11 as a function of temperature . our data on the temperature dependence of @xmath7 show , over a temperature range extending from @xmath10 to @xmath5 , a perfect @xmath50 dependence for all the doping levels investigated .",
    "no anomalies at temperatures close to @xmath6 ( or at the temperature at which @xmath18 deviates from linearity ) are found in @xmath51 .",

    "[ figure3 ] , that this temperature is essentially not affected by the sensitivity criterium used to define the deviation in the @xmath50 temperature dependence of @xmath7 . as can be seen also in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , this second characteristic temperature @xmath52 , is well correlated with the temperature at which @xmath11 displays a peak and is almost independent of the doping level in the range investigated . at this temperature",
    "@xmath52 no anomaly is observed in the resistivity , the peak in @xmath53 has to be attributed to the change in @xmath51 .    since no deviation in @xmath7",
    "is observed at high temperature ( close to @xmath6 ) , we conclude in the two relaxation times picture , that the deviation in @xmath24 has to be attributed to a change in @xmath21 , a diminution of the scattering rate related to the opening of the pseudogap . since @xmath54 , a deviation from the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity should be observed at the same characteristic temperature .",
    "a detailed analysis of the resistivity is difficult however , since , as often observed in underdoped thin films , the resistivity is not linear with temperature in this temperature range .",
    "it should be noticed that the @xmath8 temperature dependence of @xmath7 is observed up to temperatures much higher than @xmath55 implying that the mechanism at the origin of the @xmath50 behavior extends at temperatures above the pseudogap phase .    in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , we present a phase diagram @xmath56 versus @xmath47 that summarizes the results of the paper .",
    "first @xmath12 versus @xmath47 is plotted ( squares ) along with single crystals data@xcite ( circles ) .",
    "the line is a guide to the eyes .",
    "as can be seen the critical temperatures of films and crystals fall on the same curve . the temperatures at which a deviation in the linear temperature dependence of @xmath18 is observed are indicated by triangles .",
    "these points follow the temperature dependence of the pseudogap temperature @xmath6 as discussed above . finally , the diamonds are the well defined temperatures @xmath52 at which a deviation in the @xmath50 behavior of @xmath7 occurs ( or at which @xmath11 is maximum ) .",
    "@xmath52 falls between @xmath12 and @xmath6 , clearly separating the pseudogap phase in two regions .    before discussing this phase diagram and in particular the temperature @xmath52",
    ", one can compare these results to very recent experiments on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath57cu@xmath58o@xmath59 films @xcite which focalize on the doping dependence of the hall response . in this system z. konstantinovi ,",
    "z. z. li and h. raffy do not observe a correlation between the peak in @xmath11 and the deviation in @xmath7 .",
    "their data , however , show that the temperature at which a deviation in @xmath51 occurs is much lower than @xmath6 , in agreement with the data presented here",
    ". we can also relate our data to other recent experimental findings .",
    "analysis of the temperature dependence of @xmath13 have suggested that the peak in @xmath13 is related to the pseudogap @xcite .",
    "it is however clear from the experimental data shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , that the temperature of the maximum in @xmath11 is well defined and does not follow the pseudogap temperature dependence , suggesting that the latter is not , at least directly , responsible for the behavior observed .",
    "there have also been reports on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath60 and la@xmath61sr@xmath62cuo@xmath63 compounds of the presence of vortex like excitations in the pseudogap phase .",
    "high frequency conductivity experiments @xcite and measurements of the nernst effect @xcite have shown that vortex like excitations are found at temperatures up to @xmath64 .",
    "although measured on different systems , these temperatures are above @xmath12 but below the pseudogap temperature @xmath6 , as the characteristic temperatures @xmath52 measured in this work .",
    "since experimentally @xcite without implying a particular scenario , the hall angle has been shown to be sensitive to magnetic impurities through @xmath20 , an interesting possibility is that vortex like excitations may affect the hall angle .",
    "these vortex like excitations could be seen as a parallel , temperature dependent channel for magnetic scattering modifying the hall angle and indirectly @xmath11 .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath7 due to this additional scattering source would be responsible , in this system for the break in the temperature dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "the nernst effect experiments , the high frequency experiments and the hall data shown here point to a new crossover in the phase diagram . from an experimental point of view , three crossover temperatures are thus observed in underdoped cuprates : from weak ( @xmath65 ) to strong pseudogap at @xmath6 and , at lower temperature , the `` new '' crossover line discussed above . the crossover from weak to strong",
    "pseudogap has been intensively discussed in the literature theoretically and experimentally@xcite .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been suggesting or calculating the existence of an additional structure in the strong pseudogap phase@xcite .",
    "in particular , phase diagrams with a new temperature @xmath66 at which charge ordering occurs@xcite have been discussed in the presence of charge inhomogeneities or stripes@xcite .",
    "experimentally , t. noda , h. eisaki and s. uchida have measured the hall effect in la@xmath67nd@xmath59sr@xmath62cuo@xmath63 [ ref . ] and have related the sharp decrease in @xmath11 to one dimensional charge transport @xcite .",
    "we note also that recently , p. devillard and j. ranninger have predicted that there should exist a new characteristic temperature @xmath68 in the pseudogap phase , between @xmath6 and @xmath12 , that corresponds to the temperature at which the electron pairs , formed at higher temperature ( @xmath6 ) , become itinerant , defining an upper limit for partial meissner screening @xcite ( and vortex like excitations ) .",
    "there are perhaps two main tentative theoretical frameworks for the pseudogap regime .",
    "in one , the pseudogap state is fluctuating superconductivity : the system is superconducting over short distances and time scales , but phase fluctuations destroy the long range superconducting order . the second main theoretical framework is related to the proximity of these systems to mott insulators , and attempts to describe these strongly correlated systems with various schemes of spin charge separation or gauge theories@xcite .",
    "the hall effect experiments presented in this paper raise in fact two related questions .",
    "firstly whether the difference between the hall and the resistivity temperature dependencies entails the existence of two different relaxation mechanisms and times , or whether it should be explained in a different way . if two different scattering times do indeed characterize the hall effect situation in high temperature superconductors , then one must somehow reconcile this fact with the existence of the lower crossover .",
    "unfortunately , the various spin charge separation theories , that provide in principle a natural explanation for the different relaxation times@xcite , have up to now , to our knowledge , not predicted a second crossover in the strong pseudogap regime .",
    "this difficulty could possibly be resolved if one assumes that the holons or chargons behave as 2d bosons : the new temperature @xmath52 could then be the critical temperature of the corresponding 3d system as recently discussed by y. j. uemura@xcite in the context of `` preformed pairs '' .",
    "on the other hand , if the lower crossover is connected with the loss of short distance phase coherence between `` preformed pairs '' , and therefore the disappearance of vortices , one is left in this phase fluctuation picture with the problem of finding a mechanism for the existence of two different relaxation times , and this , way above @xmath55 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the transport properties , resistivity and hall effect , in a series of underdoped gdba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 epitaxial thin films , grown by off - axis magnetron sputtering .",
    "we find that the inverse hall constant is linear over a temperature range that decreases as @xmath12 decreases .",
    "the temperature at which a deviation in @xmath3 occurs is close to the pseudogap temperature @xmath6 measured in this material .",
    "we also find that @xmath7 displays a perfect @xmath50 temperature dependence over a large temperature range extending from about @xmath10 to @xmath5 .",
    "we observe for all the samples that the temperature at which the temperature dependence of the hall angle deviates from the @xmath50 behavior is precisely correlated to the temperature at which @xmath11 displays a peak .",
    "this characteristic temperature , found to lie between @xmath12 and the pseudogap temperature @xmath6 , does not depend markedly on the doping level and defines a new crossover in the phase diagram .",
