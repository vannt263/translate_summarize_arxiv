    "with the constant improvement of observational techniques in the past decades , more and more detailed information about accretion disc systems could be gained .",
    "in particular , a large number of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) have been discovered ( fabbiano  1989 ) , imposing a severe problem upon the existing general idea of accretion disc systems : with a bolometric luminosity exceeding @xmath0 , at least some of them show relatively low radiation temperatures ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "these systems have been suggested to be intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) , sub - eddington accretion disc systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , large samples of ulxs from recent observational data reveal that a distinct class exists , showing higher temperatures  sometimes exceeding @xmath2  than can be explained by imbhs ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , stellar mass black holes accreting above their eddington limit can account for these sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the applicability of the classical eddington limit is an important point in this discussion : similar to the stellar case , disc accretion may be limited by radiation pressure , counteracting gravity and viscous dissipation .",
    "while in the stellar case , we are dealing with an approximately spherically symmetric , i.e. , 1-dimensional situation , discs require an  at least  2-dimensional treatment .",
    "the stellar eddington limit implies several assumptions , which do not apply for the disc case , though it is not clear _ a priori _ to what degree a proper treatment will alter the resulting numbers .    in our work",
    ", we calculate the _ local _ analog to the eddington limit for a classical thin disc model of the @xcite variety and for a slim disc model of the @xcite type ( sect .",
    "[ sec_bh_accretion ] ) . in both descriptions ,",
    "a standard @xmath3-viscosity is applied , therefore restricting the models to the non - selfgravitating case .",
    "we also investigate the spectral energy distribution of supercritical accretion flows in the stellar mass black hole case , based on the radiation hydrodynamic ( rhd ) simulations computed by @xcite ( sect .",
    "[ sec_sed ] ) .",
    "the physical reasoning for the eddington limit is an equilibrium of the attractive force @xmath4 and the repelling force @xmath5 .",
    "the original stellar eddington limit relies on several assumptions : ( 1 ) spherical symmetry of the system ; ( 2 ) isotropic radiation ; ( 3 ) homogeneous degree of ionisation ; ( 4 ) thomson scattering as the sole source of opacity ; ( 5 ) negligible gas pressure ; ( 6 ) no relativistic effects ; and ( 7 ) no time dependence ( stationarity ) . to investigate",
    "if these assumptions are an oversimplification in the disc case , we relinquish the approximations ( 1)(5 ) , but keep the approximation of non - relativistic stationarity for our calculation .",
    "we assume azimuthal symmetry in the following .",
    "therefore , one can define two different `` eddington limits '' , corresponding to the equilibria in the vertical ( @xmath6 ) and radial ( @xmath7 ) direction . with the distance @xmath8 to the origin , @xmath9 for a rotating viscous disc ,",
    "further contributions to the total force have to be included in the radial direction : @xmath10 in the following , as an example , we calculate the maximum amount of matter @xmath11 that can be accreted towards the central object in the case of a stellar mass black hole , @xmath12 , for non - selfgravitating discs with an @xmath3-parameter of @xmath13 . for both the thin and the slim disc case , we use two descriptions for the opacity : firstly , simple thomson scattering is applied : @xmath14 .",
    "secondly , we use an interpolation formula , @xmath15 ( gail , priv . comm . ) , which accounts for further contributions like bound - free and free - free absorption . for a detailed description of @xmath16",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we refer our results to the classical eddington - limit , which in the disc case with a torque - free boundary condition at the disc s inner radius @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "detailed calculations reveal that the vertical limit sets severer conditions on the critical accretion rates and corresponding luminosities than the radial limit in both the thin and the slim disc model .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the results for the vertical limit in the following .",
    "figure  [ fig_mp_edd ] shows the results for the critical accretion rates @xmath11 in the vertical eddington limit as a function of the radial distance @xmath7 from the central object . in the slim disc case , one free parameter remains to be determined by hand : the ratio of the local height @xmath20 of the disc to the local radial distance @xmath7 .",
    "since the slim disc model is valid for @xmath21 , we plot the results for the two cases @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , the critical accretion rates are no longer given by a global quantity like @xmath24 : they depend on the radius @xmath25 .",
    "while the opacity has a strong influence on the results ( @xmath26 ) for low accretion rates , it becomes more and more unimportant in the slim disc model for high accretion rates .",
    "this is due to the fact that advection dominates the energy transport in this regime .",
    "as can be seen from the results for thin discs , the inner boundary condition plays a crucial role in determining the maximum amount of matter which finally reaches the central black hole . for slim discs",
    ", the critical accretion rates may reach up to @xmath27 , while at the same time the luminosity stays close to the classical limit , @xmath28 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , highly super - eddington accretion comes along with only mildly super - eddington luminosities .",

    "this work is based on 2d rhd simulations , which are presented in detail in @xcite . in a spherical computational box of @xmath31 radius",
    ", matter is injected continuously in the disc plane @xmath32 around a @xmath33 black hole at high rates ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "again , the viscosity is parameterized by @xmath35 . for the energy transport equation , radiation and advection",
    "are taken into account , as well as photon trapping effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate the spectral energy distribution of this system for various inclination angles @xmath36 between @xmath37 ( face - on ) and @xmath30 ( edge - on ) . for details about the computation , we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "the resulting seds for inclination angles @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath30 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sed](a ) .",
    "while in the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectrum no difference between the orientations of the system can be seen , the peak intensity region around @xmath2 is shifted towards higher photon energies and higher luminosities for lower inclination angles .",
    "for all orientations , a plateau - like structure in the high - energy part of the spectrum can be observed , although this feature is more prominent for the face - on case .",
    "its origin lies in the emission of the hot gas in the vicinity of the black hole : when calculating the spectrum for @xmath39 while neglecting gas emission and absorption , this plateau disappears .    to outline the orientation effects",
    ", we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig_sed](b ) the total intensity emitted by the system for inclination angles @xmath40 . for small inclinations ,",
    "the intensity rises by a factor of up to @xmath41 for @xmath39 ; this is due to both an enhanced average photon energy and an increased total photon number .",
    "we identify this behavior with _ mild relativistic beaming_. when fitting the peak intensity region with a black body spectrum , we derive temperatures between @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath39 .",
    "the above investigations allow us to draw several conclusions on black hole accretion processes .",
    "firstly , we show that the classical eddington limit can not be applied in discs .",
    "contrary , the critical accretion rates become a local quantity , depending on the distance from the central object . thereby , the inner disc region and inner boundary hold the key position in determining the final amount of matter that can be accreted by the central object .",
    "we find that super - eddington accretion is possible with accretion rates up to @xmath27 , corresponding to slightly super - eddington luminosities up to @xmath45 .",
    "since the bottle - neck for accretion lies in the inner region of the disc , our results may also correlate to the question on the origin of outflows and jets .",
    "secondly , our work on the spectral energy distribution of such super - eddington accreting systems shows that for a proper interpretation of the spectrum , the combined system of the disc and its surroundings has to be taken into account .",
    "features like the high - energy plateau can not be reproduced by considering the accretion disc only . also , we find that mild relativistic beaming becomes important for small inclination angles , leading to higher luminosities and also higher temperatures",
    ". however , these temperatures are still too low to account for the observed ulx sources which sometimes reach temperatures up to @xmath46 .",
    "this may be due to the lack of comptonization effects in our calculations : @xcite , for example , showed that turbulent comptonization produces a significant contribution to the far - uv and x - ray emission of black hole accretion discs .",
    "thus , the inclusion of comptonization effects will be a primary goal in our future investigations .",
