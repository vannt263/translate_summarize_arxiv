    "in 1932 , heisenberg has postulated isotopic spin as a general symmetry of nature to describe systematically atomic nuclei .",
    "isospin prevails to be important in hadronic physics , both in concept @xcite and experiment @xcite .",
    "but in the fundamental hadronic theory , in the gauge theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , isospin symmetry is not manifest in any obvious way .",
    "the present work is intended to contribute yet an other facet to an old and immanent question @xcite , without addressing however to be complete or exclusive .",
    "nowadays isospin symmetry is believed to be part of the more general chiral symmetry to the extent that the symmetry is thought to be manifest at sufficiently high temperatures and broken after a chiral phase transition in which the quarks acquire mass .",
    "these ideas can be modeled by lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) @xcite .",
    "but when it comes down to calculate hadrons in their ground state ( at absolute zero ) , lgt has some difficulties to calculate with the same quality of approximations for all the hadrons , because of the enormously different mass scales in the problem .",
    "particularly , it is not easy to extrapolate reliably down to the very light and small mesons like the pions .",
    "recently , an equally non - perturbative alternative has gradually emerged as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the light - cone approach addresses to diagonalize the ( light - cone ) hamiltonian , @xmath0 , and to calculate the spectra and invariant masses ( squared ) of physical particles .",
    "in particular the method addresses to calculate the associated wave functions @xmath1 , which are the fock - space projections of the hadrons eigenstate .",
    "the total wave function for a meson is then @xmath2 , for example .",
    "i present in section  [ sec:2 ] some general aspects of the method , based on which i formulate in section  [ sec:2a ] a sufficiently simple model . in order to be as concrete and pedagogic as possible",
    ", i continue in section  [ sec:3 ] with an over - simplified model for 2 and 3 flavors which can be solved in closed form .",
    "i generalize in section  [ sec:4 ] to five flavors , and compare to experiment . in section  [ sec:5",
    "] , i draw the conclusions .",
    "[ t ]        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , consider 3 flavors .",
    "the flavor mixing matrix for the ground state becomes @xmath3 the model assumption eq.([eq : modii ] ) changes that into a matrix with elements    @xmath4    if one assumes @xmath5 , thus @xmath6 , as above , @xmath7 can be diagonalized againin closed form .",
    "the three eigenstates @xmath8 are associated with the eigenvalues @xmath9 the coherent state picks up all the strength , again .",
    "the eigenvalues of the remaining two states coincide with the unperturbated ones .",
    "state @xmath10 can again be interpreted as the eigenstate for the charge neutral @xmath11 and the mass of the coherent state @xmath12 could be fitted with the @xmath13 .",
    "but then state @xmath14 is degenerate with the @xmath11 : instead of a mass triplet one has a mass quadruplet .",
    "obviously , one can not abstract from the appreciable mass difference between the up and strange quark . a @xmath15 matrix like in eq.([eq:20 ] ) can not be diagonalized in a simple way .",
    "it was diagonalized analytically but approximately in @xcite .",

    "the five flavor mixing - matrix @xmath7 is given in eq.([eq:20 ] ) , just with @xmath28 .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath29 are obtained from table  [ tab:4 ] . diagonalizing @xmath30 numerically , produces the wavefunctions @xmath31 in table  [ tab : wav ] and the physical masses @xmath17 in table  [ tab:4 ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is used to reproduce the mass of the @xmath13 , as indicated by the star @xmath20 in the table .",
    "the corresponding results for pseudo - vector mesons are found in table  [ tab:5 ] .    by adjusting one single parameter ,",
    "one reproduces three empirical facts : ( 1 ) the mass of the @xmath11 is ( strictly ) degenerate with @xmath33 ( isospin ) ; ( 2 ) the unperturbed mass of the @xmath34 is lifted from the comparably small value of @xmath35  mev to the comparatively large value of @xmath36  mev ; ( 3 ) the unperturbed mass of the @xmath13 is lifted by roughly 50% the meet the experimental value .",
    "the wave functions have also remarkable properties , as seen from table  [ tab : wav ] .",
    "the numerical results in the table remind to the su(3 ) pattern in eq.([eq : su3 ] ) .",
    "particularly the isospin - pattern of the @xmath11 and the coherent - state pattern of the @xmath13-wavefunction should emphasized .",
    "the heavy quark admixtures are small .",
    "in the present light - cone approach to gauge theory with an effective interaction isospin is not a dynamic symmetry , but a consequence of equal up and down mass .",
    "flavor - su(3 ) is an approximate symmetry .",
    "the approach explains even the phenomenological observation that flavor - su(3 ) symmetry works better than su(4 ) or su(5 ) ; the large mass of the heavy mesons dominates the flavor - mixing matrix so strongly that the symmetry induced by the annihilation interaction is destroyed .",
    "the present work contributes to the @xmath34-@xmath13 puzzle @xcite and exposes an accuracy comparable to state - of - art lattice gauge calculations @xcite . to the best of my knowledge no other model including the phenomenological ones @xcite covers the whole range of flavored hadrons with the same set of parameters .",
    "the present approach is however in conflict with other theoretical constructs .",
    "zero modes are absent since one works with the light - cone gauge @xmath37 @xcite . in consequence",
    "there are no chiral condensates which seem to be so important otherwise .",
    "they are not needed here since the parameter @xmath32 provides the additional mass scale .",
    "it will be calculated from the theory in future work , removing then all parameter dependence beyond @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "at least one knows now that this is worth an effort .",
