    "the suggestion that gamma - ray burst ( grb ) fireballs should contain a good fraction of neutrons has attracted broad attention recently , since in essentially all progenitor scenarios the neutron component is likely an inevitable ingredient for a baryonic grb fireball ( e.g. , derishev et al .",
    "1999a ; beloborodov 2003a ; pruet et al .",
    "for instance , core - collapse of massive stars would lead to an outflow from an iron - rich core with the parameter @xmath1 , the neutron - to - proton number ratio , being @xmath2 ( e.g. , beloborodov 2003a ) . in the neutron star merger model that may be valid for short - hard grbs",
    ", one would also expect @xmath3 .",
    "photo dissociation during collapse or merger , as well as @xmath4 , @xmath5 decoupling and inelastic collisions , would both drive @xmath1 towards unity , although such an equalization process is likely to remain incomplete ( bachall & mszros 2000 ) .",
    "weak interactions induced by the intense neutrino flux from the central engine can result in significant proton - to - neutron conversion , especially if resonant neutrino flavor transformation takes place ( qian et al .",
    "1993 ; fuller et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "derishev et al .",
    "( 1999a , 1999b ) first investigated the dynamics and the possible observational signatures of a relativistic neutron - rich fireball .",
    "this was followed by many related investigations .",
    "one advantage of the neutron rich model is that the baryon - loading problem for grbs can be ameliorated if significant fraction of baryons confined in the fireball are converted to neutrons ( fuller et al .",
    "the existence of the neutron component likely leaves various observational signatures .",
    "for example , the decoupling between the neutron and the proton components during the early fireball acceleration phase would give rise to a distinct multi - gev neutrino emission signature because of the inelastic neutron - ion collisions in the fireball ( bachall & mszros 2000 ; mszros & rees 2000 ) .",
    "such a gev neutrino signature is however not easy to detect in the near future . lately",
    "fan & wei ( 2004 ) suggested that there should be a bright ultraviolet ( uv ) flash accompanying a grb from neutron - rich internal shocks , as long as the burst is long enoughray photons ( beloborodov 2005 ) , so that the uv flash may be dimmer by 5 mag , but it is still bright enough to be detected by the _ swift _ uvot . the predicted such low energy photon flash accompanying the prompt @xmath0ray emission may have already been detected in grb 041219a ( blake et al .",
    "2005 ; vestrand et al .",
    "2005 ) , for which it is found the optical emission during the burst is variable and correlated with the prompt @xmath0rays , indicating a common origin for the optical light and the @xmath0rays ( vestrand et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this viewpoint has also been supported by the ir band observation ( blake et al . 2005 ) . ] .",
    "such a uv flash is in principle detectable by the ultraviolet - optical telescope ( uvot ) on board the _ swift _ observatory .",
    "however , since such signals happen early ( typically @xmath6s after the burst trigger ) , given the nominal uvot on - target time ( 60 - 100 s ) , testing this signature requires an optimized detector configuration . the most promising approach to test the neutron component would be the signatures in the early afterglow phase , typically tens to hundreds of seconds after the burst trigger , when uvot is likely on - target .",
    "such early afterglow neutron signatures have been suggested earlier ( derishev et al . 1999b",
    "; beloborodov 2003b , hereafter b03 ) .",
    "however , there has been no detailed calculations so far , and this is the main focus of the current paper .",
    "our work differs from b03 in three main aspects : ( i ) in b03 , the neutron shell ( n - ejecta ) always keeps ahead of the ion - ejecta ( i - ejecta ) , so almost all the decayed products from the n - ejecta are deposited onto the external medium and are used to accelerate the medium .",
    "such an approximation is only valid when the burst duration is short enough ( e.g. for short bursts ) . in this work",
    "we show that for typical long grbs , the separation between the n - ejecta and the i - ejecta is not clean . the n - ejecta would partially overlap the i - ejecta until a long distance @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mean @xmath9decay ( @xmath10 ) radius of the n - ejecta , @xmath11 is the bulk lorentz factor ( lf ) of the n - ejecta , and the convention @xmath12 is adopted in cgs units here and throughout the text .",
    "consequently , a significant fraction of the @xmath9decay products are deposited in the i - ejecta rather than in the external medium .",
    "so the neutron - decay trail ( i.e. , the external medium mixed with the @xmath9decay products ) is less energetic than that suggested in b03 .",
    "nonetheless , we confirmed the conclusion of b03 that the presence of the neutron ejecta qualitatively changes the afterglow emission properties .",
    "( ii ) b03 mainly discussed the dynamical evolution of a neutron - fed fireball .",
    "the energy dissipation rates in the neutron front and in the shock front have been calculated .",
    "although they can delineate the main characteristics of a neutron - fed fireball , these results are not easy to be directly compared with the observations . in this work ,",
    "we extend b03 s investigations to calculate synchrotron radiation both from the shocks and from the neutron decay trail .",
    "we calculated in detail some sample early optical lightcurves , which can be directly compared with the future observations by _ swift _ uvot or similar telescopes .",
    "( iii ) b03 mainly discussed the influence of neutrons on the forward shock ( fs ) emission . in this work besides the fs component , we also explicitly discuss the emission from the reverse shock ( rs ) region , which has been widely accepted to play an important role in shaping early afterglow lightcurves .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in  [ physicsmodel ] , we present the physical picture , including the neutron - rich internal shocks , the formation of the i - ejecta , the neutron decay trail and the dynamics of the neutron - fed fireball . in  [ numexap ] ( for long grbs ) and  [ numexap : short ] ( for short grbs ) , we model the dynamics of neutron - rich systems numerically and calculate the synchrotron radiation of various emission components . sample early optical afterglows for typical parameters are calculated and presented . for long grbs (  [ numexap ] ) , the cases for both a constant - density medium ( ism ) and for a stellar - wind medium ( wind ) are presented .",
    "our results are summarized in  [ dis ] with some discussions .",
    "in the standard grb model , a fireball made up of @xmath13,@xmath14 and an admixture of baryons is generated by the release of a large amount of energy @xmath15 in a region of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total energy of the burst assuming isotropic energy distribution .",
    "data from the bursts with known redshifts indicate that a typical fireball is characterized by a wind luminosity @xmath18 @xmath19 and a duration @xmath20 , measured in the observer frame . above the fireball injection radius @xmath21",
    "the bulk lorentz factor ( hereafter lf ) @xmath22 varies as @xmath23 initially and saturates when it reaches an asymptotic value @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 ( e.g. mszros et al .",
    "1993 ; piran et al .",
    "1993 ) .    for an @xmath4 , @xmath5 fireball ,",
    "the picture becomes more complicated .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 components are cold in the co - moving frame , and remain well coupled until the co - moving nuclear elastic scattering time @xmath27 becomes longer than the co - moving expansion time @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the pion production cross section above the threshold @xmath30 mev , @xmath31 is the co - moving proton density which according to mass conservation reads @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "therefore the @xmath4 , @xmath5 decoupling occurs in the coasting or accelerating regimes depending on whether the dimensionless entropy @xmath25 is below or above the critical value @xmath33^{-1/4}$ ] ( bachall & mszros 2000 ; beloborodov 2003a ) .    for @xmath34 , both @xmath4 and @xmath5 coast with @xmath35 . for @xmath36",
    ", the condition @xmath37 is achieved at a radius @xmath38 . while protons are still being accelerated as @xmath39 , the neutrons are no longer accelerated and they coast at a lf of @xmath40^{-1/3}\\eta_{\\rm 3 } ^{-1/3}$ ] ( derishev et al .",
    "1999a ) . from energy conservation ,",
    "one gets the asymptotic proton lorentz factor @xmath41)(6/7)(\\eta_{\\rm \\pi}/\\eta)^{4/3}]$ ] ( bachall & mszros 2000 ) .      in the standard fireball model , the long",
    ", complex grbs are powered by the interaction of proton shells with different lfs .",
    "the practical lf distribution of these shells could be very complicated , and detailed simulations of these interactions is beyond the scope of this work . as a simple toy model , here we follow fan & wei ( 2004 ) to assume that lfs of the shells follow an approximate bimodal distribution ( guetta et al .",
    "2001 ) with the typical values taken as @xmath42 ( fast shells ) or @xmath43 ( slow shells ) with equal probability .",
    "this simple model is favored for its ability to produce a relatively high radiation efficiency and a narrow peak energy distribution within a same burst .",
    "the new ingredient we consider here includes the @xmath4-component for both the fast and the slow shells .    comparing the prompt emission energy and",
    "the afterglow kinetic energy derived from multi - wavelength data fits ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) , it is found that a significant fraction of the initial kinetic energy is converted into internal energy and radiated as gamma - rays ( panaitescu @xmath44 kumar 2002 ; lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 ) . within the internal shock model",
    ", this requires that the velocity difference between the shells is significant , i.e. @xmath45 , and that the two masses are comparable , i.e. @xmath46 ( piran 1999 ) . generally , @xmath43 is in the order of tens , and @xmath42 is in the order of hundreds .",
    "thus , for slow shells the @xmath4 , @xmath5 components likely coast with a same lf , i.e. @xmath47 , while for fast shells the @xmath4 , @xmath5 components may have different lfs , which are denoted as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , respectively .    when an inner faster shell catches up with an outer slower shell , the ion component merges into a single ion shell .",
    "for simplicity this process is approximated as a relativistic inelastic collision .",
    "energy and momentum conservations result in @xmath50^{1/2}$ ] ( paczyski & xu 1994 ; piran 1999 ) , where @xmath51 is the lf of the merged ion shell .",
    "as shown in fan & wei ( 2004 ) , the merged ion shells are further decelerated by the decay products of the slow neutron shells . given a small lf of the slow neutron shells , the mean neutron decay radius is smaller , i.e. @xmath52 cm .",
    "the decay products would be collected by the merged ion shells at the radii in the range of @xmath53 .",
    "shocks are formed , and the ion shells further merge with the decay products of the slow neutron shell .",
    "the resulted typical lf of the ion shells would be @xmath54 which will be regarded as the initial lf of the ion shell ( hereafter called the i - ejecta ) whose dynamical evolution we will discuss below .",
    "the thermal lf of the protons in the shocked region reads @xmath55 and the electron synchrotron emission in the region gives rise to a bright uv flash ( fan & wei 2004 ) .",
    "notice that the presence of the neutron component does not help to increase the @xmath13-ray emission efficiency . given a same amount of baryon loading and a same total energy ,",
    "the lf of the fast ion shells is larger than that in the neutron - free model , while the lf of the slow ion shells ( @xmath56 ) remains the same .",
    "although the collision of the fast  slow ion shells is more efficient than in the neutron free model , a significant part of the total energy is carried by the fast neutrons shell ( i.e. the n - ejecta ) most of which is not translated into the prompt @xmath0ray emission . as a result , the grb efficiency in the neutron  fed model may be even lower than that in the neutron free model .",
    "rossi et al . (",
    "2004 ) gave another argument on the low radiation efficiency of neutron - rich internal shocks .",
    "it is worth noticing that the internal shock efficiency is also lowered in a magnetized flow , even magnetic dissipation plays an essential role ( fan et al .",
    "2004c ) .      while the fast ion shells are decelerated by the slower ions ( including both the slow ion shells and the decay products of the slow neutrons ) , the fast neutron shells ( which will be denoted as the `` n - ejecta '' ) are not .",
    "as long as they move fast enough , say , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the lf of the i - ejecta , considering the dynamical evolution ) , the n - ejecta would freely penetrate through all the ion shells in front of them and would separate from the i - ejecta more and more . as the result of @xmath59-decay , the mass of the fast neutrons gradually decreases as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the original mass of the total fast neutrons",
    ", @xmath62 is the characteristic neutron decay radius , and @xmath63 s is the rest - frame neutron decay time scale .",
    "if neutrons decay in the circumburst medium , the @xmath9decay products @xmath5 and @xmath64 would immediately share their momenta with the ambient particles through two - stream instability ( b03 ) . here",
    "we take the number density of the external medium ( in unit of @xmath65 ) as @xmath66 where `` ism '' and `` wind '' represent the uniform interstellar medium and stellar wind , respectively , @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the mass loss rate of the progenitor , and @xmath69 is the wind velocity ( dai & lu 1998 ; mszros et al . 1998 ; chevalier & li 2000 ) .",
    "b03 discussed a neutron decay `` trail '' , which is a mixture of the ambient particles with the decay products left behind the neutron front .",
    "he then discussed the interaction of the follow - up i - ejecta with this trail and suggested that the trail would modify the dynamical evolution of the i - ejecta and hence the afterglow lightcurves .",
    "such a clean picture is strictly valid for very short bursts , for which the n - i ejecta separation radius @xmath70 ( eq.[[rs ] ] ) is shorter than @xmath71 . for most of the long grbs for which the majority of the afterglow data are available ,",
    "not all the decayed mass @xmath72 is deposited onto the circumburst medium .",
    "part of it is deposited onto the i - ejecta itself .",
    "the neutron decay products therefore influence the dynamical evolutions of both the medium and the ejecta . in this paper",
    ", we will define the `` neutron trail '' only as those decay products that are deposited onto the circumburst medium .",
    "those deposited onto the i - ejecta itself will be treated separately .      with the presence of neutrons ,",
    "the dynamics of the whole system is far more complex than the neutron - free case .",
    "the physical pictures for both the ism and the wind environment are considerably different .",
    "below is a qualitative discussion , and more detailed formulation is presented in  [ numexap ] .    for the wind case",
    ", the medium is very dense , so the decay products are immediately decelerated significantly , and the resulting bulk lf of the trail is in the order of tens .",
    "the trail is picked up by the i - ejecta quickly .",
    "a fs propagates into the trail and a rs propagates into the i - ejecta .",
    "since the lf of the fs @xmath73 is smaller than @xmath74 , the fs never propagates into the wind medium directly , although at later times the neutron decay rate becomes so low that the neutron trail essentially does not alter the wind medium . besides the emission from both the fs and the rs , for @xmath75 the unshocked neutron trail may also give non - negligible emission contribution in the optical band .",
    "the thermal lf in the trail is several for typical parameters .",
    "given a reasonable estimate of the local magnetic fields , the typical synchrotron radiation frequency is around the optical band , so that it could give an interesting contribution to the optical afterglow emission .",
    "this is discussed in  [ wind ] in detail .    for the ism case and for @xmath76 , unless @xmath4 is very large , the inertia of the swept medium is too small to decelerate the decayed fast neutrons significantly .",
    "if the i - ejecta moves slower than the n - ejecta ( which is our nominal case ) , the neutron trail most likely moves faster than the i - ejecta , i.e. @xmath77 , where @xmath13 is the lf of the trail .",
    "a gap forms between the trail and the i - ejecta .",
    "since the neutron decay rate drops with radius , the trail lf also decreases with radius .",
    "this leads to pile - up of the neutron trail materials with higher lfs .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of the dynamical evolution of the trail is complicated . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "it is adequate to treat the fast trail as a global t - ejecta , which in many aspects are analogous to the i - ejecta . in front of the t - ejecta , there are still some newly decayed products ( we still call these the neutron trail ) behind the n - ejecta front .",
    "even further ahead the n - ejecta is the unperturbed ism .",
    "the fast moving t - ejecta shocks into the trail and further into the ism and gets decelerated .",
    "the lorentz factor of this forward shock @xmath73 is sometimes larger than the lorentz factor of the n - ejecta @xmath11 , so that the shock front is directly in the ism . in any case , the very early afterglow emission is from this `` t - ejecta '' forward shock .",
    "the i - ejecta , which lags behind without significant interaction with the ism , is not noticeable in the beginning .",
    "later , the i - ejecta catches up with the decelerated t - ejecta , giving rise to a pair of refreshed shocks that power strong ir / optical emission .",
    "an energy - injection bump is expected , which has direct observational consequence .",
    "the whole process is discussed in ",
    "[ ism ] in detail .",
    "below we calculate the r - band early afterglow lightcurves , focusing on the novel properties introduced by the neutron component . in this section we deal with the traditional long grbs , those with @xmath78s and believed to be produced during core collapses of massive stars .",
    "short bursts are discussed in  [ numexap : short ] .",
    "two widely discussed circumburst medium types are ism and wind , and we discuss the lightcurves for both cases in turn .",
    "it is widely believed that synchrotron radiation of the shocked electrons powers the observed afterglow emission .",
    "the detailed formulae for synchrotron radiation are summarized in appendix [ app - a ] . in the text we mainly focus on the dynamical evolution of the entire system .",
    "one novel feature of the neutron - fed early afterglow is the emission from the neutron decay trail , especially in the wind case .",
    "the detailed particle acceleration mechanism as well as the radiation mechanism in the trail is poorly known . in this paper , we adopt two extreme models to treat the trail emission ( see appendix [ app - b ] for details ) .",
    "the first treatment is similar to the shock case , i.e. , assuming a power - law distribution of the electrons .",
    "the second treatment is to simply assume a mono - energetic distribution of the electron energy .",
    "we believe that a more realistic situation lies in between these two cases . in both cases",
    "we introduce the equipartition parameters of electrons and magnetic fields .",
    "similar to fan & wei ( 2004 ) , we take @xmath79 ( including the total energy of the fast / slow neutrons and protons at the end of the prompt @xmath0ray emission phase ) , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 . in the ism and the wind cases ,",
    "the number density is taken as @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( i.e. @xmath86 ) , respectively .",
    "the width of the n - ejecta in the observer frame is taken as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the width of the ion - ejecta in the rest frame of the central engine and the observer ( correspondingly , @xmath89 ) . in order to find out how the neutron emission signature depends on the neutron fraction , in each model",
    "we calculate four lightcurves that correspond to the neutron - to - proton number ratio , @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "besides the neutron signature , another important ingredient in the early afterglow phase is the rs emission .",
    "the early dynamical evolution of a neutron - free shell and its interaction with the circumburst medium has been investigated in great detail both analytically ( e.g. , sari & piran 1995 ; kobayashi 2000 ; chevalier & li 2000 ; wu et al . 2003 ; z. li et al .",

    "the early afterglows of several grbs ( including grb 990123 , grb 021211 and possibly grb 021004 ) have been modeled within the rs emission model ( e.g. , sari & piran 1999 ; mszros & rees 1999 ; wang et al .",

    "2004 ) . with the presence of neutrons , the dynamical evolution of the ejecta and the rs emission becomes more complicated .",
    "below we will formulate the entire process in detail .",
    "the results are reduced to the conventional results when @xmath91 , but become more complicated as @xmath1 gets larger .    in this work",
    "we assume that the medium contains electrons and protons only . in reality , at radii smaller than @xmath92 cm , the medium may be enriched by @xmath93 pairs created by the interaction of the prompt @xmath0rays with the back - scattered @xmath13-rays by the medium ( e.g. beloborodov 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the influence of pairs on the early afterglow lightcurves is neglected in this work and will be considered elsewhere .",
    "we will first consider the wind model in which no gap is formed between the i - ejecta and the trail so that the dynamics is simpler ( see  [ ism ] for a detailed treatment for the gap case ) .",
    "the ejecta - trail interaction can be divided into two phases .",
    "( i ) before the rs crosses the ejecta , @xmath94 ( where @xmath95 is the radius at which rs crosses the ejecta ) , there exist two shocks , i.e. a fs expanding into the trail , and a rs penetrating into the i - ejecta .",
    "( ii ) after the rs crosses the ejecta , @xmath96 , only the fs exists .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sch1 ] , there are five regions : ( 1 ) the rest wind medium ; ( 2 ) the unshocked neutron trail , moving with a lf @xmath13 ; ( 3 ) the shocked neutron trail , moving with a lf @xmath22 ; ( 4 ) the shocked i - ejecta , moving with the lf @xmath22 ; and ( 5 ) the unshocked i - ejecta , moving with a lf @xmath58 .",

    "following b03 , we take @xmath100 , @xmath72 as the mass of the ambient medium overtaken by the n - ejecta and the mass of the decayed fast neutrons , respectively . for the long bursts we are discussing ,",
    "only a fraction of @xmath72 is deposited onto the medium ( the rest is deposited onto the i - ejecta ) .",
    "a shock propagates into the trail , and in the problem what is relevant is the fraction of the decay products that are deposited onto the unshocked trail ( region 2 in figure [ fig : sch1 ] ) .",
    "we denote this fraction as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the width of the n - ejecta , which is the same as that of the i - ejecta , and @xmath103 is the separation between the front of the n - ejecta and the front of the fs that propagates into the neutron decay trail .",
    "this is valid for the wind case , in which @xmath104 is always satisfied . for the ism case (  [ ism ] ) , under certain conditions the fs front leads the n - ejecta front , and we take @xmath105 following the same definition here .",
    "if this happens , nothing is deposited onto the unshocked medium , and in our treatment we will define @xmath106 whenever @xmath105 is satisfied . notice that by defining @xmath107 , we have assumed that neutrons in the n - ejecta decay uniformly within the length @xmath102 , which is justified by the fact @xmath108 .",

    "the dynamical evolution of the shocks presented here [ e.g. fig.[fig : wind](a ) ] look different from the one presented in fig.1 of b03 , which shows that the dynamics of a neutron - fed fireball is very different from the neutron - free one .",

    "a more realistic model should lie in between these two models .",
    "figure [ fig : trail ] indicates a fortunate fact that the differences between the two extreme models are far from large , although the mono - energetic model predicts a stronger r - band trail emission .",

    "we now turn to discuss the ism - interaction for long grbs .",
    "the main characteristic of the ism case is that the trail typically moves faster than the i - ejecta , so that a gap forms between the i - ejecta and the t - ejecta ( the trail ejecta ) .",

    ", we approximately divide the trail materials into two parts .",
    "the fast trail ( including forward shocked trail ) is denoted as the t - ejecta , while the upstream unshocked part is still called the trail .",
    "the location of the shock is roughly defined by requiring the bulk lf of the t - ejecta ( which is calculated through energy and momentum conservation ) is larger than @xmath233 , so that the relative lf between the two parts exceeds 1.25 .",

    "the dynamical evolution of the system ( lf of the t - ejecta ) and the r - band lightcurve in the ism - interaction case are calculated for @xmath2780 , 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 , respectively ( see figure [ fig : ism ] ) . in the cases of @xmath279 and @xmath214 , there is a gap between the i - ejecta and the t - ejecta , and a bump is evident in both the @xmath280 and @xmath281 diagrams .",
    "this bump is the signature for the i - ejecta and t - ejecta collision . when @xmath282 , this signature is not significant , mainly because the gap is not well - developed .",

    "the early r - band flux for @xmath279 and @xmath214 is also different from the case of @xmath91 .",
    "this is because the early afterglow for a high-@xmath1 case is powered by the t - ejecta , which has a smaller mass in the beginning than the i - ejecta .",

    "the rising behavior of the early afterglow is because the typical synchrotron frequency is above the band . for the high-@xmath1 case ,",

    "an interesting question is to explore how to use the lightcurve to diagnose the existence of the neutron component for the ism case .",
    "for example , the initial rising lightcurve of a neutron - free fireball is steep , while for a neutron - fed fireball it is much milder because of the contribution of the shocked trail emission .",
    "the sharp bump in the early afterglow stage is a prominent signature .",
    "however , it suggests that an energy injection event happens , not necessarily a proof of the existence of the neutron component .",
    "nonetheless , the neutron - fed model gives a natural mechanism for post energy injection , and it suggests that an early bump is common for long grbs with ism - interaction as long as @xmath1 is reasonably large , say @xmath286 . if future swift observations reveal that an early bump is common , it may suggest that the grb fireballs are baryonic with a large fraction of neutrons .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for the neutron - free model , an early afterglow bump is also expected due to the transition from the rs emission to the fs emission ( e.g. kobayashi & zhang 2003a ; zhang et al .",
    "nonetheless , the bump due to energy injection ( presumably powered by the collision between the i - ejecta and the t - ejecta ) could be well - differentiated .",
    "for example , the injection bump is achromatic , while the fs peak is chromatic , caused by crossing of the typical frequency into the band .",
    "finally , the rs emission for @xmath91 is weaker than the rrs emission in the high-@xmath1 case ( figure [ fig : ism](b ) ) .",
    "this is because the ejecta is assumed to be cold for the neutron - free case , while for the neutron - rich case , it is hot ( see equation ( [ gamma_ith ] ) ) . at the rrs front",
    ", the original thermal energy of the protons would be also shared by the electrons , leading to stronger emission .",
    "the neutron - fed signatures last only for a few 100 seconds .",
    "rapid and frequent monitoring ( e.g. with @xmath287 5 s exposure interval ) of early optical afterglow is needed to catch these signatures .",
    "swift uvot , with an on - target time 60 - 100 s , has the capability to detect such signals .",
    "bursts with durations shorter than 2 s may have different physical origin .",
    "the leading model for short grbs invokes mergers of two compact objects ( e.g. , ns - ns merger or bh - ns merger , see e.g. eichler et al .",
    "although there are other suggestions about the origin of short grbs , the merger model was found suitable to interpret many short grb properties ( e.g. ruffert et al . 1997 ) .",
    "a pre - concept of such a merger model is that the burst site is expected to have a large offset from the host galaxy due to asymmetric kicks during the births of the nss , and that the number density of the external medium is low , typically @xmath288 .",
    "such a suggestion seems to receive support from the afterglow data of the recent short , soft grb 040924 ( fan et al .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , in the compact object merger model ( especially the ns - ns merger model ) , the outflow is very likely to be neutron - rich ( @xmath289 ) .",
    "here we calculate the early optical afterglow lightcurve of a neutron - rich short grb ( @xmath214 ) and compare it with the neutron - free case .",
    "we take the following typical parameters for a short grb .",
    "the burst duration is taken @xmath290 , so that the width of the n - ejecta is @xmath291 .",
    "the total ( include both protons and neutrons ) isotropic energy is @xmath292 .",
    "the initial lf of the merged ion shell and the neutron shell are @xmath82 , @xmath80 , respectively . the i - eject and the n - ejecta separate at a radius @xmath293 , which is much smaller than the typical decay radius @xmath294 . as a result , for short bursts most of the neutron decay products",
    "are deposited onto the ism ( i.e. @xmath295 ) .",
    "this is the `` clean '' scenario discussed by b03 .",
    "the resulting @xmath220 in the trail is very large for @xmath296 , and a gap still forms between the trail ( t - ejecta ) and the i - ejecta .",
    "the calculation is therefore the same as the ism - model for long grbs ( see  [ ism ] for detail ) . for @xmath297 and @xmath298 ,",
    "the i - ejecta starts to spread at @xmath299 ( e.g. , piran 1999 ) .",
    "this radius is much smaller than the deceleration radius , which is @xmath300 for @xmath91 . in our calculation , we take the spreaded width @xmath301 when calculating the rs emission . also here",
    "we perform numerical calculations as compared with the analytical treatment presented in fan et al .",
    "( 2005b ) .",
    "we found that the relative lf between the unshocked i - ejecta and the shocked i - ejecta is smaller than the one estimated in fan et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , so that the rs emission is further suppressed .",
    "the lightcurves are plotted in figure [ fig : short ] for @xmath91 and @xmath214 .",
    "similar to figure [ fig : ism](b ) , the main difference between the two cases is that for the latter the very early lightcurve increases more slowly with time .",
    "this is due to the contribution from the shocked trail .",
    "a collision also happens as the i - ejecta catches up with the decelerated t - ejecta .",
    "the signature , which is manifested as a steeper increasing lightcurve around 20 s , is however not as prominent as the long grb case .",
    "there are two reasons .",
    "one is that the t - ejecta and the i - ejecta now have a comparable mass , since essentially all the neutron decay products are stored in the t - ejecta ( for comparison , for long bursts , a good fraction is deposited onto the i - ejecta so that the i - ejecta is much more energetic than the t - ejecta ) .",
    "second , the rrs is very weak , and the main contribution to the lightcurve is the fs component ( for comparison , for long bursts , the rrs component dominates the bump emission ) .",
    "nonetheless , we identify some novel features of a neutron - rich short grb .",
    "the signature occurs too early , however , and the global afterglow level is very dim due to the small @xmath302 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is still a challenging task to diagnose the neutron component in short grbs .",
    "the composition of the outflow that powers grbs is still far from clear .",
    "the well - collected late afterglow data are unfortunately not suitable to study the grb fireball composition , since the afterglow radiation comes from the shocked medium rather than the fireball materials .",
    "understanding the fireball composition and hence the nature of the explosion requires detailed early afterglow data . in general a grb fireball is composed of two distinct components , a baryonic component and a poynting flux component .",
    "current early afterglow data suggest that grb ejecta seem to be magnetized ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang et al . 2003 ; kumar & panaitescu 2003 ) .",
    "closer modeling suggests that for grb 990123 and grb 021211 in which the reverse shock magnetic field is stronger than that in the forward shock region , the @xmath303 parameter , i.e. the poynting flux to baryonic flux ratio , is moderate ( zhang & kobayashi 2004 ; fan et al .",
    "in other two cases of early afterglow ( grb 021004 and grb 030418 ) , detailed modeling is needed to reveal whether poynting flux is important . in any case , it is likely that the baryonic component is at least non - negligible .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the neutron component is an inevitable composition within the baryonic component , and the diagnosis of the neutron component is a handle to reveal the significance of the baryonic component in grb fireballs . in the literature ,",
    "the possible neutron signatures discussed include the multi - gev neutrino emission ( e.g. derishev et al .",
    "1999a ; bachall & mszros 2000 ; mszros & rees 2000 ) and the uv flash accompanying the @xmath0ray emission phase ( fan & wei 2004).ray emission ) during grb 041219a ( blake et al . 2005",
    "; vestrand et al . 2005 ) . ] the detection of these signals are difficult due to the limitation of the current detector capability .",
    "the most prominent neutron signature is likely imprinted in the early afterglow .",
    "this suggestion has been proposed ( e.g. derishev et al .",
    "1999b ; b03 ) , but no detailed calculations have been performed .",
    "in this paper , we present a first detailed calculation of early optical afterglow lightcurves for a neutron - fed fireball .",
    "we considered both long and short grbs , and for long grbs we consider both a ism medium and a wind medium . for each model",
    ", we calculate the lightcurves for different @xmath1 ( the neutron - to - proton number density ratio ) values , aiming to study how the neutron component progressively change the lightcurve behavior as @xmath1 increases .",
    "we confirmed the previous suggestions that the presence of neutrons changes the fireball dynamics and the lightcurves ( derishev et al .",
    "1999b ; b03 ) .",
    "our findings are summarized as follows .",
    "\\1 . for short grbs , the neutron decay products deposit onto the ism medium",
    "mostly , and the neutron decay trail clearly separates from the ion ejecta ( i - ejecta ) . this is the clean picture delineated in b03 . for long grbs ,",
    "the picture is more complicated .",
    "only part of the decay products are deposited onto the medium .",
    "the rest are deposited onto the i - ejecta itself or onto the shocked region .",
    "the neutron signatures in long grbs therefore require more complicated treatments .",
    "if the medium is a pre - stellar wind ( for long grbs ) , the neutron trail moves slowly ( mainly because the medium inertia is too large ) .",
    "the trail and the i - ejecta do not separate from each other , and a forward shock propagates into the trail directly .",
    "three components contribute to the final emission , i.e. the forward shock , the reverse shock propagates into the i - ejecta , and the unshocked trail emission .",
    "the latter is significant when @xmath1 is large , since the internal energy of the unshocked trail is large when the medium density is high .",
    "a typical neutron - rich wind - interaction lightcurve is a characterized by a prominent early plateau lasting for @xmath215 s followed by a normal power - law decay ( fig.[fig : wind ] ) .",
    "we also show that in the wind case , the ic cooling effect due to the overlapping of the initial prompt @xmath0ray with the shocks and the trail ( e.g. beloborodov 2005 ; fan et al .",
    "2005a ) suppresses the very early r - band afterglow significantly , and the neutron - fed signature is also dimmed ( see fig.[fig : wind](b ) and fig.[fig : wind](c ) for a comparison ) .",
    "if the medium is a constant density ism ( for long grbs ) , part of the neutron decay products fall onto the medium , and the trail moves faster than the i - ejecta . a gap likely forms between the leading trail and the i - ejecta .",
    "the former forms a distinct trail ejecta ( t - ejecta ) which interacts with the out trail or ism .",
    "the latter catches up later and gives rise to a rebrigtening signature . before collision , the radiation is dominated by the forward shock emission . during the collision , both the forward shock emission and the refreshed shocks ( especially the refreshed reverse shock )",
    "are important .",
    "the unshocked trail emission is not important in this case .",
    "a typical neutron - rich ism - interaction lightcurve is characterized by a slow initial rising lightcurve followed by a prominent bump signature around tens to hundreds of seconds ( fig.[fig : ism ] ) .",
    "the picture for short grbs is similar to the case of long grbs with ism - interaction .",
    "the injection bump is less prominent and the refreshed reverse shock is not important .",
    "a typical neutron - rich short grb lightcurve is characterized by a slow initial rising lightcurve followed by a step - like injection signature ( fig.[fig : short ] ) .",
    "for all the cases , the predicted signatures can be detected by the uvot on board the _ swift _ observatory .",
    "however , most of these signatures ( such as the plateau and the bump signature ) are not exclusively for neutron decay .",
    "more detailed modeling and case study are needed to verify the existence of the neutron component .",
    "a neutron - fed fireball involves very complicated processes and some not well - studied physical problems ( e.g. particle acceleration and emission in the trail ) . in principle a complicated numerical model is needed to delineate the problem . in this paper",
    ", we made some approximations to simplify the problem and eventually come up with a semi - analytical model .",
    "such a treatment nonetheless catches the main novel features of the model .",
    "further studies are needed to build up a more realistic model of neutron - fed fireballs .",
    "so far there are four grbs whose early afterglows are detected ( akerlof et al .",
    "1999 ; fox et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b ; w. li et al .",
    "2003 ; rykoff et al .",
    "2004 , see zhang & mszros 2004 for a recent review ) , i.e. grb 990123 , grb 021004 , grb 021211 and grb 030418 .",
    "modeling grb 990123 and grb 021211 suggests that these two bursts are born in an ism medium ( e.g. panaitescu & kumar 2002 ; kumar & panaitescu 2003 ) .",
    "the early afterglow of these two bursts are dominated by fast - decaying optical flash , usually interpreted as the reverse shock emission component .",
    "no neutron - signature discussed in this paper has been discovered .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this .",
    "first , the ejecta of these two bursts are likely magnetized ( fan et al .",
    "2002 , 2004b ; zhang et al .",
    "2003 ; zhang & kobayashi 2004 ; kumar & panaitescu 2003 ; panaitescu & kumar 2004 ; mcmahon et al .",
    "this would dilute the neutron signature discussed in this paper ( in which @xmath304 has been assumed throughout ) .",
    "second , modeling suggests that the initial lf of the i - ejecta of these two bursts are large , around 1000 ( e.g. wang et al .",
    "2000 ; soderberg & ramirez - ruiz 2002 ; wei 2003 ; kumar & panaitescu 2003 ) . since the n - ejecta could not be accelerated to a very high lf ( bahcall & mszros 2000 ) , the n - ejecta likely lags behind the i - ejecta , and its influence on the fireball dynamics is minimized .",
    "the early afterglows of other two bursts grb 021004 and grb 030418 are not easy to interpret within the standard reverse shock picture .",
    "one suggestion is that both bursts are born in a wind environment ( e.g. li & chevalier 2003 ; rykoff et al .",
    "if this is the case , the available earliest detection at @xmath305 is too late to catch the trail emission predicted in this paper .",
    "alternatively , they are potentially interpreted in an ism model with the neutron signature discussed in this paper . with the combination of the injection bump and the forward shock bump ( e.g. kobayashi & zhang 2003a )",
    ", one might be able to achieve a broad early bump to interpret the early afterglow behavior of grb 021004 and grb 030418 .",
    "finally , these two bursts may be modeled by a high-@xmath303 flow ( e.g. zhang & kobayashi 2004 for more discussions ) .",
    "more detailed modeling is needed to verify these suggestions .    with the presence of magnetic fields , the acceleration and interaction of the neutron component may have some novel features . in the magnetization scenario ,",
    "a two component jet is likely , with the wide less collimated jet being due to the mildly relativistic neutrons ( vlahakis et al .",
    "2003 ; peng et al .",
    "peng et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that the decay products in the wider neutron component would give rise to an injection bump in the afterglow for an observer on - beam the narrow core jet .",
    "in such a picture , for an observer off - beam of the narrow jet but on - beam the wide jet , the observer would see an orphan - afterglow - type event .",
    "since the lf of the wide component is about 15 , the neutrons would decay at a typical distance of @xmath306 cm . the decay products shock into the ambient medium and get decelerated at a further distance ( the deceleration distance ) . for somewhat optimistic parameters ( @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath309 , @xmath84 and @xmath86 ) , the forward shock typical synchrotron frequency at the typical neutron decay radius is @xmath310 for an ism medium , or @xmath311 for a wind - medium . in the ism case ,",
    "the optical lightcurve increases rapidly with time and reaches a peak at the deceleration time ( typically hours after the burst trigger ) . in the wind case ,",
    "since the soft x - ray band is above both @xmath217 and @xmath218 , the lightcurve between the typical decay time and the deceleration time is essentially flat ( @xmath312 ) , giving rise to a flat soft x - ray plateau lasting for hours .",
    "this would be an interesting signature for the neutron - rich two - component jet model in the wind environment .",
    "however , without a @xmath13-ray or hard x - ray precursor , detecting such a signature is challenging .",

    "one novel feature of the neutron - fed grb afterglow , in particular in the wind - medium case , is the emission from the neutron decay trail itself ( without being shocked ) .",

    "<S> the neutron component is likely an inevitable ingredient of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) baryonic fireball , in essentially all progenitor scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the suggestion that the neutron composition may alter the early afterglow behavior has been proposed , but there is no detailed calculation so far . in this paper , within the popular internal shock scenario of grbs , we calculate the early optical afterglow lightcurves of a neutron - fed grb fireball for different assumed neutron fractions in the fireball and for both ism- and wind - interaction models . </S>",
    "<S> the cases for both long and short grbs are considered . </S>",
    "<S> we show that as long as the neutron fraction is significant ( e.g. the number of neutrons is comparable to that of protons ) , rich afterglow signatures would show up . for a constant density ( ism ) model , a neutron - rich early afterglow is characterized by a slowly rising lightcurve followed by a sharp re - brightening bump caused by collision between the leading neutron decay trail ejecta and the trailing ion ejecta . for a massive star stellar - wind model </S>",
    "<S> , the neutron - rich early afterglow shows an extended plateau lasting for about 100 seconds before the lightcurve starts to decay . </S>",
    "<S> the plateau is mainly attributed to the emission from the unshocked neutron decay trail . when the overlapping of the initial prompt @xmath0rays with the shocks and the trail is important , as is common for the wind model and is also possible in the ism model under some conditions , the ic cooling effect suppresses the very early optical afterglow significantly , making the neutron - fed signature dimmer . for short grbs powered by compact star mergers , a neutron - decay - induced step - like re - brightening is predicted , although the amplitude is not large . </S>",
    "<S> all these neutron - fed signatures are likely detectable by the ultraviolet optical telescope ( uvot ) on board the _ swift _ observatory if grb fireballs are indeed baryonic and neutron - rich . </S>",
    "<S> close monitoring of early afterglows from 10s to 1000s of seconds , when combined with detailed theoretical modeling , could be used to potentially diagnose the existence of the neutron component in grb fireballs . </S>"
