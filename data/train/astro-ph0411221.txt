    "recent observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating at the present time . these results ,",
    "when combined with the observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite , strongly suggest that the universe is spatially flat and dominated by an exotic component with large negative pressure , referred to as dark energy @xcite .",
    "the first year result of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) shows that dark energy occupies about @xmath4 of the energy of our universe , and dark matter about @xmath5 .",
    "the usual baryon matter which can be described by our known particle theory occupies only about @xmath6 of the total energy of the universe .",
    "although we can affirm that the ultimate fate of the universe is determined by the feature of dark energy , the nature of dark energy as well as its cosmological origin remain enigmatic at present .",
    "so far the confirmed information about dark energy is still limited and can be roughly summarized as the following several items : it is a kind of exotic energy form with sufficiently large negative pressure such that drives the universe to undergo a period of accelerating expansion currently ; it is spatially homogeneous and non - clustering ; and it is in small part at the early times while dominates the universe very recently .",
    "the investigation of the nature of dark energy is an important mission in the modern cosmology .",
    "much work has been done on this issue , and there is still a long way to go . currently , the preferred candidates of dark energy are vacuum energy ( or cosmological constant ) and dynamical fields .",
    "the simplest form of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath7 .",
    "a tiny positive cosmological constant which can naturally explain the current acceleration would encounter many theoretical problems , such as the `` fine - tuning '' problem and the `` coincidence '' problem .",
    "another possible form of dark energy is provided by scalar fields .",
    "dark energy can be attributed to the dynamics of a scalar field @xmath8 , called quintessence @xcite , which convincingly realize the present accelerated expansion of the universe by evolving slowly down its potential @xmath9 .",
    "the tracker version quintessence is to some extent likely to resolve the coincidence problem .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the coupled quintessence models @xcite provide this problem with a more natural solution . however , for quintessence models with flat potentials , the quintessence field has to be nearly massless and one thus expects radiative corrections to destabilize the ratio between this mass and the other known scales of physics . in addition , for the cosmological constant and many quintessence models , the event horizon would lead to a potential incompatibility with the string theory .",
    "other designs on dark energy roughly include k - essence @xcite , quiessence ( or `` x - matter '' ) @xcite , brane world @xcite , tachyon @xcite , generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite , holographic dark energy @xcite , and so forth .",
    "the quiessence or x - matter component is simply characterized by a constant , non - positive equation of state @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is a necessary condition to make the universe accelerate ) . in general , in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background with the presence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , an arbitrary but constant @xmath10 for dark energy from the range @xmath12 can be achieved by using a scalar field with a hyperbolic sine potential @xcite . it may be noted that in principle the value of @xmath10 may be even less than @xmath13 . in fact , by fitting the sne ia data in the framework of xcdm ( x - matter with cdm ) , the hint for @xmath14 has been found .",
    "indeed , a study of high-@xmath15 sne ia @xcite finds that the equation of state of dark energy has a @xmath16 probability of being @xmath17 if no priors are placed on @xmath18 .",
    "when these sne results are combined with cmb and 2dfgrs the @xmath19 confidence limits on an unevolving equation of state are @xmath20 @xcite which is consistent with estimates made by other groups @xcite .",
    "the possibility of @xmath14 has provoked lots of investigations on the phantom dark energy @xcite .",
    "the remarkable feature of the phantom model is that the universe will end its life with a `` big rip '' ( future singularity ) within a finite time @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we concern here another interesting proposal on dark energy , i.e. the dark energy component might be explained by a background fluid with an exotic equation of state , the generalized chaplygin gas model @xcite .",
    "the striking feature of this model is that it allows for a unification of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "this point can be easily seen from the fact that the gcg behaves as a dust - like matter at early times and behaves like a cosmological constant at late stage .",
    "this dual role is at the heart of the surprising properties of the gcg model .",
    "moreover , the gcg model has been successfully confronted with various phenomenological tests involving sne ia data , cmb peak locations , gravitational lensing and other observational data @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the gcg equation of state has a well defined connection with string and brane theories @xcite , and this gas is the only gas known to admit a supersymmetric generalization @xcite .",
    "in addition , it should be pointed out that the gcg model can be portrayed as a picture that cosmological constant type dark energy interacts with cold dark matter . however , since the equation of state of dark energy still can not be determined exactly , the observational data show @xmath10 is in the range of @xmath21 , the gcg model should naturally be generalized to accommodate any possible x - type dark energy with constant @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we propose here a new generalized chaplygin gas ( ngcg ) scenario as a scheme for unification of x - type dark energy and dark matter .",
    "the feature of this new model should also be exhibited in that dark sectors are uniformly described by an exotic background fluid and this new gas behaves as a dust - like matter at early times and as a x - type dark energy at late times .",
    "we will show in this paper that this model is a kind of interacting xcdm model , and constrain the parameters of this model by using observational data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the extension version of the generalized chaplygin gas , namely the ngcg model , to describe the unification of dark energy and dark matter , and demonstrate that the ngcg actually is a kind of interacting xcdm system . in section 3 , we analyze the ngcg model by means of the statefinder parameters . in section 4 , we constrain the parameters of the ngcg model using the sne ia , cmb , and lss data .",
    "we give concluding remarks in the final section .",
    "in this section we introduce the ngcg model . in the framework of frw cosmology , considering an exotic background fluid ,",
    "the ngcg , described by the equation of state @xmath22 where @xmath3 is a real number and @xmath23 is a function depends upon the scale factor of the universe , @xmath1 .",
    "we might expect that this exotic background fluid smoothly interpolates between a dust dominated phase @xmath24 and a dark energy dominated phase @xmath25 where @xmath10 is a constant and should be taken as any possible value in the range @xmath26 .",
    "it can be expected that the energy density of the ngcg should be elegantly expressed as @xmath27^{1 \\over 1 + \\alpha}~.\\label{chrho}\\ ] ] the derivation of the eq .",
    "( [ chrho ] ) should be the consequence of substituting the equation of state eq .",
    "( [ eqstate ] ) into the energy conservation equation of the ngcg for an homogeneous and isotropic spacetime , this requires the function @xmath23 to be of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a positive constant , and the other positive constant @xmath30 appears in eq .",
    "( [ chrho ] ) an integration constant .",
    "one can see explicitly that this model recovers the gcg model as the equation - of - state parameter @xmath10 taken to be @xmath13 , and an ordinary @xmath31cdm model can be reproduced by taking the parameter @xmath3 to be zero .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is called _ interaction parameter _ of the model as will be shown below .",
    "the ngcg scenario involves an interacting xcdm picture . for showing this ,",
    "we first decompose the ngcg fluid into two components , one is the dark energy component , and the other is the dark matter component , @xmath32 note that the pressure of the ngcg fluid is provided only by the dark energy component , namely @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the energy density of the dark energy ingredient can be given @xmath34^{\\alpha\\over 1+\\alpha}}~~,\\label{rhox}\\ ] ] and then the energy density of the dark matter component can also be obtained @xmath35^{\\alpha\\over 1+\\alpha}}~~.\\label{rhodm}\\ ] ] from these expressions one obtains the scaling behavior of the energy densities @xmath36 we see explicitly from it that there must exist an energy flow between dark matter and dark energy provided that @xmath37 . when @xmath38 , the transfer direction of the energy flow is from dark matter to dark energy ; when @xmath39 , just the reverse .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the parameter @xmath3 characterizes the interaction between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "this is the reason for that we call @xmath3 the interaction parameter .    the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be expressed in terms of current cosmological observables . from eq.([chrho ] )",
    ", it is easy to get @xmath40 where @xmath41 is used to characterize the interaction for simplicity , thus we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a dimensionless parameter . using eqs .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) and ( [ as ] ) , one gets @xmath44 where the second equality stands for the cosmological model involving the baryon matter component .",

    "we depict this interaction through an energy exchange term @xmath48 .",

    "( [ de ] ) and ( [ dm ] ) , one can obtain @xmath57 @xmath58    now we switch to discuss the cosmological evolution . consider a spatially flat frw universe with baryon matter component @xmath59 and ngcg fluid @xmath60 , the friedmann equation reads @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the friedmann equation can also be expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath64^{1/\\eta}+\\omega_b^0 a^{-3}\\right\\}^{1/2}~.\\ ] ] then , the fractional energy densities of various components can be easily obtained @xmath65^{{1\\over\\eta}-1}~,\\label{omegax}\\ ] ] @xmath66^{{1\\over\\eta}-1}~,\\ ] ] @xmath67    so far we see clearly that the ngcg model is totally dual to a coupled dark energy scenario @xcite , namely an interacting xcdm parametrization .",
    "it is remarkable that the interaction between dark energy and dark matter can be interpreted as arising from the time variation of the mass of dark matter particles .",
    "the gcg model is a special case in the ngcg model corresponding to @xmath68 , thus the gcg model is actually an interacting @xmath7cdm model . fig.1 and fig.2 illustrate examples of the density evolution in the ngcg model .",

    "note that the @xmath76 case corresponds to a normal phantom model with constant @xmath10 . in this example",
    "we see the role the interaction parameter @xmath3 plays in the model .",
    "the transfer energy flows from dark matter to dark energy when @xmath38 ; the larger @xmath3 leads to the stronger energy flow ; density of baryon component is also affected evidently by the interaction between dark energy and dark matter . in fig.2 , we depict the cases with common interaction parameter @xmath77 , and the equation - of - state parameters @xmath10 are taken to be @xmath13 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , respectively . here",

    "let us now discuss the cosmological consequences led by the ngcg model and compare the cosmological quantities in the ngcg cosmology with those of some special cases such as @xmath7cdm and gcg .",
    "firstly , we regard the hubble parameter @xmath80 which evaluates the expansion rate of the universe . in fig.3",
    "we plot the hubble parameter of the ngcg model in units of @xmath81 as a function of redshift @xmath15 range from 0 to 5 .",
    "the current density parameters used in the plot of fig.3 are the same as used in figs.1 and 2 .",
    "the model parameters are divided into two groups , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , both including @xmath68 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "it can be seen from fig.3 that the ngcg model degenerates to the xcdm when the parameter @xmath3 takes 0 ; the cases of @xmath82 and @xmath14 make @xmath80 larger than and less than @xmath83 , respectively , during the cosmological evolution .",
    "the introducing of the interaction parameter @xmath3 makes @xmath80 be larger than @xmath84 evidently at early times ; while it is interesting to see that the value of @xmath85 can cross 1 in the case of @xmath14 in recent period .",
    "the acceleration of the universe is evaluated by the deceleration parameter @xmath86 . omitting the radiation component ,",
    "the deceleration parameter can be expressed as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is given by ( [ omegax ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the deceleration parameter @xmath89 is depicted in fig.3 for selected parameter sets .",
    "the current density parameters are taken to be the same as above figures .",
    "the influence coming from the interaction @xmath3 and equation of state of dark energy @xmath10 can be seen clearly in this figure .",
    "we notice that a positive @xmath3 makes the redshift of acceleration / deceleration transition ( @xmath90 ) shift to a smaller value ; while the values of @xmath91 are nearly degenerate under the same @xmath3 as shown in this example .",

    "since more and more dark energy models have been constructed for interpreting or describing the cosmic acceleration , the problem of discriminating between the various contenders becomes very important . in order to be able to differentiate between those competing cosmological scenarios involving dark energy , a sensitive and robust diagnostic for dark energy models",
    "is a must . for this purpose",
    "a diagnostic proposal that makes use of parameter pair @xmath92 , the so - called `` statefinder '' , was introduced by sahni et al . @xcite .",
    "the statefinder probes the expansion dynamics of the universe through higher derivatives of the scale factor @xmath93 and is a natural companion to the deceleration parameter @xmath89 which depends upon @xmath94 .",
    "the statefinder pair @xmath92 is defined as follows @xmath95 the statefinder is a `` geometrical '' diagnostic in the sense that it depends upon the scale factor and hence upon the metric describing space - time .",
    "trajectories in the @xmath96 plane corresponding to different cosmological models exhibit qualitatively different behaviors .",
    "the spatially flat @xmath7cdm scenario corresponds to a fixed point in the diagram @xmath97 departure of a given dark energy model from this fixed point provides a good way of establishing the `` distance '' of this model from @xmath7cdm @xcite . as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite the statefinder can successfully differentiate between a wide variety of dark energy models including the cosmological constant , quintessence , quintom , the chaplygin gas , braneworld models , holographic dark energy and interacting dark energy models .",
    "we can clearly identify the `` distance '' from a given dark energy model to the @xmath7cdm scenario by using the @xmath98 evolution diagram .",
    "the current location of the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 in these diagrams can be calculated in models , and on the other hand it can also be extracted from data coming from snap ( supernovae acceleration probe ) type experiments @xcite .",

    "we apply the statefinder diagnostic to the ngcg model .    in what follows",
    "we will calculate the rangefinder parameters for the ngcg model and plot the evolution trajectories of the model in the statefinder parameter - plane .",
    "the statefinder parameters can be expressed in terms of the total energy density @xmath102 and the total pressure @xmath103 in the universe : @xmath104 the total energy of the universe is conserved , so we have @xmath105 since the dust matter does not have pressure , the total pressure of the cosmic fluids is provided only by dark energy component , @xmath106 . then making use of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , we can get the concrete expression of the statefinder parameters @xmath109 here @xmath110 and @xmath88 are given by ( [ wxeff ] ) and ( [ omegax ] ) , respectively .",

    "it is very clear that the original chaplygin gas model , @xmath187 ( or @xmath188 ) and @xmath68 , is totally ruled out by the observational data at @xmath173 confidence level .",
    "in addition , it should be pointed out that when we fix @xmath188 and let @xmath10 free , the ngcg model will be identified as the so - called variable chaplygin gas ( vcg ) model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "the joint analysis of sne+cmb+lss also rules out this probability .",
    "it is hopeful that the future precise data will provide more strong evidences to judge whether the dark energy is the cosmological constant and whether dark energy and dark matter are in unification .",
    ".8 cm    .8 cm    .8 cm",
    "the chaplygin gas model is a proposal to describe dark energy and dark matter as a unified fluid , the chaplygin gas , characterized by an exotic equation of state @xmath189 , where @xmath29 is a positive constant .",
    "since this original chaplygin gas has been ruled out by the observations , a generalization of the chaplygin equation of state @xmath190 was considered , by introducing a free parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas model is also regarded as a unification of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "the reason is that the gcg behaves as a dust - like matter at early stage and as a cosmological constant at late stage .",
    "that is to say that the gcg model admits that the universe will be dominated by a cosmological constant and thus enter into a de sitter phase in the future .",
    "however , we can not hitherto affirm whether the dark energy is a tiny positive cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , the scheme for unification of dark energy and dark matter should accommodate other forms of dark energy such as quintessence - like and phantom - like dark energy .",
    "this is the motivation for us to further generalize the gcg model .",
    "we propose in this paper a new model as a scheme for the unification of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "this new model is a further extension version of the gcg model , thus dubbed new generalized chaplygin gas model .",
    "this further generalization is implemented by introducing another free parameter @xmath10 to make the constant @xmath29 in the gcg equation of state become a scale factor dependent function @xmath23 . in order to implement the interpolation between a dust dominated universe and an x - matter dominated universe ,",
    "the unique choice of @xmath23 is @xmath2 . through a two - fluid decomposition ,",
    "we show that the ngcg model is totally equivalent to an interacting xcdm parametrization scenario , in which the interaction between dark energy and dark matter is characterized by the constant @xmath3 .",
    "we discuss the cosmological consequences led by such an unified dark sectors model .",
    "furthermore , a statefinder diagnostic is performed on this scenario and the discrimination between this scenario and other dark energy models is shown .",
    "finally , a combined analysis of the data of sne ia , cmb , and lss is used to constrain the parameters of the ngcg model .",
    "the fit result shows that the joint analysis can provide a considerably tight constraint on the ngcg model .",
    "according to the observational test , the best fit happens at the vicinity of the @xmath7cdm .",
    "we hope that the future precise data will provide more strong evidences to judge whether the dark energy is the cosmological constant and whether dark energy and dark matter can be unified into one component .",
    "also , it would be interesting to investigate the evolution of density perturbations and the structure formation in the ngcg scenario .",
