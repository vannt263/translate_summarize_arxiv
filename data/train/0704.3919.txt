    "it is well - known that the most advanced stellar models , taking into account rotation - induced hydrodynamic processes of meridional circulation and shear mixing , are quite adequately describing the structure of massive stars @xcite . for solar - type stars with relatively wide convective regions ,",
    "however , these models predict _ large _ rotation gradients and are in a notable contradiction with recent observational helioseismology data @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the insufficiently high efficiency of the common hydrodynamic instabilities that are characteristic to these models : these instabilities can redistribute the angular momentum between the different layers of the radiative region , but they are _ not _ strong enough to ensure the onset of a uniform rotation regime .",
    "while the radiative interiors of solar - type stars rotate quite uniformly , their convective zones rotate differentially .",
    "mounting observational evidence indicates that the radiative interior of the sun , for instance , rotates almost as a solid body , with a quasi - flat seismic rotation profile @xcite .",
    "but the solar convective zone exhibits a strong shearing in the latitudinal direction , with its equatorial layers rotating about 1/3 faster than the polar regions @xcite .",
    "the transition between the differential and the uniform rotation regimes takes place in a relatively thin layer ( with thickness @xmath0 ) , called the _ tachocline _ , where the radial shearing of the rotation is particularly significant @xcite .",
    "it is often argued that some kind of shear instability must be the source of gravity waves at the base of the solar convection zone @xcite , either in the immediate vicinity or just inside the tachocline .",
    "this instability can hardly be of a purely hydrodynamical nature , because from various numerical studies of the buoyant rise of magnetic flux from the bottom of the convection zone to the surface of the sun it follows that the tachocline is strongly magnetized with its poloidal magnetic field about @xmath1 g @xcite .    from this perspective",
    "it seems quite plausible to surmise that on the time - scale of the order of the solar age or less not only purely hydrodynamic internal gravity waves ( igws ) participate in the process of the angular momentum redistribution within the solar interior , but also , or rather , gravito - mhd waves .",
    "this idea is _ not _ new . in the literature",
    "it has been argued @xcite that gravito - mhd waves could be one of the most promising candidates for the onset of the redistribution processes .",
    "it was argued that a self - consistent model should comprise a large - scale magnetic field in the sun s interior , and an accurate consideration of the coriolis effects in the convection zone and in the tachocline @xcite .",
    "it was also argued that turbulent stresses in the convection zone , via the agency of coriolis effects , induce a meridional circulation , causing the gas from the convection zone to burrow downwards and generate both horizontal and vertical velocity shear characterizing the tachocline .",
    "however , the interior magnetic field confines the burrowing and , hence , smooths and diminishes the shear , as demanded by the observed structure of the tachocline . according to @xcite , a decisive test of this _ qualitative _ scenario , after numerical refinements",
    ", would be its _ quantitative _ consistency with the observed interior angular velocity structure .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present the results of a detailed study of the linear dynamics of perturbations in gravitationally stratified magnetized shear flows .",
    "bearing in mind the highly probable importance of the gravito - mhd waves for the structure of the sun and solar - type stars , we decided to pose and study the following three interrelated issues : 1 )  how the presence of the nonuniform velocity field affects the propagation of the waves through the stellar plasma ; 2 )  what kind of energy exchange processes between the different collective modes and between the modes and the ambient flow may happen ; and 3 )  what other astrophysical consequences these processes could have .",
    "originally , we develop the three - dimensional ( 3d ) model , allowing the ambient flow to have velocity shearing in both transversal ( prior to the gravity field ) directions . further on ,",
    "the study is focused by a number of simplifying assumptions , enabling the solution of the equations .",
    "first of all , we consider only two spatial dimensions ( 2d ) bearing in mind that it is quite straightforward to extend the analysis to the fully three - dimensional case .",
    "second , we assume a constant steady - state ( or stationary ) shear flow , an assumption that allows us to use the _ shearing sheet approximation _ @xcite . and third , we use the _ boussinesq approximation _ , and hence we study the dynamics of relatively small - scale , much smaller then stratification length scale @xmath2 . ]",
    "perturbations of the low - frequency modes , viz .",
    "the gravito - alfvn waves ( gaw ) and the entropy mode ( em ) perturbations .",
    "our study leads to the conclusion that for _ arbitrary _ shear in the flow , there exists a finite interval of time in which the evolution of the modes is highly non - adiabatic . outside this interval ,",
    "the evolution is adiabatic and can be accurately described by a wkb approximation .",
    "therefore , we have an asymptotic problem , quite common for various quantum - mechanical applications , where one needs to obtain connection formulae in _ turning point problems _ @xcite . the relevant analysis is done in this paper and it is found that the non - adiabatic behavior of the considered modes manifests itself in the form of two phenomena , viz .  the _ over - reflection _ of the gaw and the _ generation _ of the gaw by the em perturbations .",
    "we show that for flows with moderate and high shearing rates both these processes are very effective converters of the equilibrium flow energy into the energy of the waves .    in the context of above - discussed astrophysical problems",
    "our results imply that efficient generation of the gaw by the em perturbations takes place for shearing rates of about an order of magnitude smaller then necessary for development of shear instability .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized in the following way : the general mathematical and heuristic formalism is presented in the sec .  2 .",
    "the over - reflection of gaw is studied in the sec .  3 ; and the second non - adiabatic process , viz .",
    "the generation of the gaw by the em perturbations , is studied in the sec .",
    "4 . finally , in sec .  5",
    "we conclude with a summary and a brief discussion of our results in the context of their possible importance for the angular momentum redistribution within solar - type stars and the solution of the problem of the uniform rotation of their radiative zones .",
    "for the sake of generality , we derive the basic set of equations for the case of 3d perturbations in a compressible , gravitationally stratified mhd fluid .",
    "this formalism will be presented in the next ( 2.1 ) subsection .",
    "later on ( subsection 2.2 ) , we will restrict the consideration to the somewhat simpler case of 2d perturbations in an incompressible medium . besides",

    "in order to explain the near uniformity of the rotation profile in the radiative region of the sun and similar regions in solar - type stars usually two different mechanisms are being proposed .",

    "it seems reasonable to assume that the above - mentioned two mechanisms are not necessarily alternatives , but could be envisaged as complementary ones . in particular , we may argue that if magnetic fields are indeed present inside the radiative zone and the gravito - mhd waves do pass through the zone , it leads to intense energy exchange processes between the waves and the stellar plasma .",
    "this circumstance , in its turn , might lead to the more efficient redistribution of the angular momentum within these stars , establishing quasi - flat rotation profiles .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field implies that it is more reasonable to speak not about purely hydrodynamical igws , but about gravito - mhd waves in general , and gravito - alfvn waves in particular .",
    "the evolution of the latter mode , present only in the magnetized case and absent in a purely hydrodynamic medium , is studied in the present paper . the theoretical background for studying of the evolution of the full set of gravito - mhd waves",

    "our study shows that the generation of the gaw by the em perturbations could provide an efficient mechanism for creating the required flux of the gaw , even for relatively low shearing rates , when the discrete eigenmodes are stable .",
    "note , in this context , that for the case presented in fig .  2 , for instance , the richardson number was about @xmath144 .    in the magnetized case , we studied the dependence of the generation coefficient @xmath145 on the richardson number @xmath146 for the relatively weak external magnetic field ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "the results of this study are presented in fig .",
    "the results clearly indicate that even though the generation coefficient falls rapidly with increasing @xmath146 , the efficient generation of the gaw by the em perturbations still takes place for @xmath148 .",
    "obviously , our study has a simplified nature and it only indicates at the possibly important role of _ non - modal _ phenomena related with gaw in the redistribution of the angular momentum and the flattening of the rotation curves in solar - type stars",
    ". for making this claim more convincing , we have to consider the compressible , three - dimensional analogue of this problem and we have to verify whether the full set of gravito - mhd waves is as efficient ( or even more efficient ) in exchanging energy with the equilibrium flow .",
    "we know from previous studies that in the absence of the gravity - induced stratification among the shear - modified mhd waves , the fast magnetosonic waves are the most efficient ones in exchanging energy with the equilibrium flow @xcite .",
    "it is of great interest to check whether the fast gravito - magnetosonic waves have the same quality and to determine what their contribution in the angular momentum redistribution could be .",
    "the study of the linear dynamics of all gravito - mhd waves is currently initiated and the results will be published in a subsequent paper .    finally , one has to remember that the non - modal approach that has been applied in the present paper , provides no information about the spatial aspects of the shear - induced processes , because the study of the spatial fourier harmonics is confined to the phase space of the wave number vectors @xmath45 . in order to have a clear idea about the spatial appearance of these processes",
    ", one has to study them numerically ( similarly to the uniform , non - stratified flow study made by @xcite ) and to check how the non - modal phenomena couple with the traditional rotational instabilities .",

    "<S> the non - adiabatic behavior manifests itself in a twofold way , viz .  by the over - reflection of the gaws and by the generation of gaws from em perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that these phenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into the energy of the perturbations for moderate and high shearing rate solar plasma flows . </S>",
    "<S> efficient generation of gaw by em takes place for shearing rates about an order of magnitude smaller than necessary for development of a shear instability . </S>",
    "<S> the latter fact could have important consequences for the problem of angular momentum redistribution within the sun and solar - type stars . </S>"
