    "compression is a fundamental part of the signal processing .",
    "since there exist a lot of redundancies when we sample a signal using nyquist rate , therefore , it needs to be compressed .",
    "it is known that two general types of redundancies exist in an   norm using log - sum penalty . since",
    "no certain guarantees have been made for algorithm s success in @xcite and the error bound is not provided , the authors in @xcite , obtained a theoretical justification of minimizing log - sum penalty .",
    "however , these methods are iterative and computationally complex than the unweighted one .",
    "therefore , the question would be how we could design the _ non - iterative _ weighting matrix for cs ?",
    "there are a few works that have attempted to design the weighting coefficients using hvs . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed foveated compressed sensing approach which utilizes hvs .",
    "this method is used for image compression and not for image acquisition since it needs foveal information .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , for two - dimensional discrete cosine transform ( dct ) the weighting coefficients for _ measurement matrix _ are derived from the standard jpeg quantization table by taking the inverse of the table entries and adjusting their amplitudes to a proper range .",
    "similarly , in @xcite , we have proposed to design the weighting coefficients for _ enhancing sparsity _ based on the standard jpeg quantization table for a video sequence .    motivated by the fact that the human eye is not much sensitive to the high frequency details , we could give an importance to each frequency in signal reconstruction , such that the high frequencies have a small effect on the performance .",
    "hence , we could expect better visuality performance from the proposed scheme compared to other conventional weighted methods .",
    "one benefit that could be expected for this approach is the weighting coefficients are independent of input images which make it non - iterative and fast . in summary ,",
    "different from the mentioned weighted approaches , here we propose to benefit from contrast sensitivity function to design weighting coefficients with the aim of enhancing sparsity .",
    "the rest of the paper will be organized as follows .",
    "section [ background ] provides a brief overview on cs and wcs .",
    "section [ proposed approach ] presents the proposed method .",
    "simulation results and discussions are given in section [ experiments ] .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper and some future directions are presented .",

    "consider a signal , @xmath0 which possesses sparse representation in a domain @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 stands fo the @xmath6 norm ) . according to cs theory ,",
    "this signal can be recovered uniquely from linear measurements @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a full - rank sensing matrix with @xmath10 .",
    "gaussian measurement matrices satisfy restricted isometry property ( rip ) constraint with high probability if the number of measurements was , at least , equal to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the signal can be uniquely recovered by solving the following minimization problem    rcl [ bp ] _ _ 0 : _ 0 + = _    although solving problem gives the exact solution , but unfortunately , it is np - hard requiring an exhaustive search over all @xmath12 possible solutions .",
    "there are some classical sparse approximation methods which find the approximate solution like matching pursuit ( mp ) @xcite and orthogonal mp ( omp ) @xcite , etc .",
    "however , these greedy algorithms are fast , but they did not have worthy performance .",
    "one alternative method to avoid np - hardness of the zero norm minimization is to replace zero norm with smallest convex @xmath13 norm which is @xmath14 norm .",
    "hence , the problem transformed into following @xmath14 minimization problem :    rcl [ f ] _ _ 1 : _ 1 + =    it is proved that this optimization problem can exactly recover the @xmath15-sparse signals and closely approximate the compressible signals with high probability @xcite .",
    "however the computational complexity of this approach is about @xmath16 and could be kind of slow for large size signals .",
    "hence there are some approaches trying to find a better function for approximating the zero norm . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have tried to directly minimize the smoothed version of zero norm which is called sl0 and is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude faster than @xmath14 minimization . in sl0 approach , the exponential smoothed version of the zero norm",
    "is considered .",
    "the authors in @xcite have tried to replace zero norm with log - sum penalty function which resulted in iterative reweighted @xmath14-minimization .",
    "it has shown that this approach reconstructs the exact @xmath15-sparse signal ( @xmath17 ) with a lower number of measurements than @xmath14-minimization algorithm , however , the computational complexity is increased because of the iterative reweighting structure .",
    "the reweighted @xmath18-minimization approach is defined as :    rcl [ rwl1 ] _ rw_1 : _",
    "i=1^nw_i| s_i | + =    where @xmath19 denotes the weights at index @xmath20 . to obtain the solution with the same sparsity structure of the original signal",
    ", @xmath21 should have small values on the nonzero locations of signal and significantly larger values elsewhere .",
    "since we havent the prior information about the location and amplitude of the non - zero elements of the sparse signal , selecting weights is done by iterative manner .",
    "common approaches for iteratively computing weights are based on recalculating weights at every iteration using the solution of ( [ rwl1 ] ) at the previous iteration .",
    "suppose @xmath22 denotes the @xmath20th element of the solution of ( [ rwl1 ] ) for a given set of weights in @xmath23th iteration .",
    "in the next iteration , the weights are updated as @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is a positive parameter in order to provide stability especially when @xmath27 is zero valued .",
    "it should be noted that the iterative reweighted @xmath14-minimization algorithm has better performance for exactly @xmath15-sparse signals .",
    "however , the improvement of this approach decreases for compressible signals .",
    "since the rwl1 approach @xcite is iterative and it has a higher computational complexity compared to unweighted cs , in this research , we try to answer this question : how we could design the _ non - iterative _ and _ image independent _ weighting matrix of cs ? motivated by the human visual system ( hvs ) which state that the sensitivity of human eye is not same for different frequencies , we could give an importance to each frequency in signal reconstruction .",
    "hence , we could expect better visuality performance from the proposed scheme compared to other state - of - the - art wcs methods .",
    "one benefit that could be expected for this approach is that the weighting coefficients are image independent which makes it non - iterative and fast .",
    "3cm(4cm,-16.5 cm )    to design a perceptual wcs scheme , first , we should know how humans see the world .",
    "there are a lot of research in this direction to provide a mathematical model of human perception .",
    "the human eye is sensitive to the _ spatial frequency _ which is defined as a number of sine or square wave gratings per visual angle .",
    "the function that model this effect is called contrast sensitivity function ( csf ) . the following model for csf is originally proposed by mannos and sakrison @xcite which is plotted in fig . [ csf_mannos ] .",

    ", this ratio normally is between 3 to 6 depending on the picture size .",
