    "the phenomenological success of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics based on the gauge group su(3)@xmath0 @xmath1 su(2)@xmath2 @xmath1 u(1)@xmath3 is moderated by a number of problems .",

    "it also offers no reason for the existence of fermion family copies and no prediction for their numbers .",
    "faced with these troubles , many theoretical ideas have been advanced beyond the sm .",
    "the minimal extension of the sm which repairs its left  right ( lr ) asymmetry is in the lr symmetric models ( lrsm ) with gauge group @xmath4 , where an interchange symmetry between the left and right sectors is assumed.@xcite the other popular choice to rectify the lr asymmetry of the sm is held by the mirror matter models based on the gauge group @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , with equal gauge coupling constants for the symmetric sectors.@xcite@xmath7@xcite however , none of these extended chiral models with lr symmetry finds the solutions to the quark ",

    "the essential results are confronted here with those related to the lrsm .",
    "the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the basis of presymmetry is an electroweak quark  lepton symmetry within the sm . for a weak hypercharge defined in terms of the electric charge and the third component of weak isospin as @xmath8",

    "lepton charge symmetry is implemented under the premise that the global piece of hypercharge has a weak topological character . since any weak topological feature can not have observable effects at the zero - temperature scale because of the smallness of the weak coupling , the charge structure reflected in eq .",
    "( [ hathyper ] ) does not apply to quarks , but to new states referred to as topological quarks .",
    "nonetheless the assignments of topological quarks to the gauge groups of the sm are the same of quarks .",
    "the electroweak presymmetry is indeed between topological quarks and preleptons having nontrivial charge structure , and between prequarks and leptons with no charge structure .    the interactions of prequarks ( topological quarks ) and leptons ( preleptons ) with the gauge and higgs fields",
    "are assumed to be described by the same lagrangian of the sm with quarks and leptons except hypercharge couplings and inclusion of dirac neutrinos .",
    "the nonstandard fermionic hypercharges generate the @xmath25 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath26 ^ 3 $ ] gauge anomalies in the couplings by fermion triangle loops of three currents associated with the chiral u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauge symmetries .",

    "vacuum states labelled by different topological numbers are then tunneled by su(2 ) instantons carrying topological charges , which are responsible for the transitions and charge shifts from the nonstandard to standard fermions .",

    "the transitions from prequarks to topological quarks and from the latter to quarks through weak su(2 ) instantons do not take place in the real world because , as argued in ref .",
    ", prequarks and topological quarks , in addition to preleptons , are not real dynamical entities .",
    "they are bare prestates of quarks and leptons seen as mathematical entities out of which the actual particle states are built up . in a sense , such transitions are truncated by the extreme smallness of the instanton transition probability .    in spite of the fact that presymmetry is a hidden electroweak symmetry within the system of quarks and leptons , the scheme defines a theoretical framework with several physical implications@xcite : it explains the fractional charge of quarks and the quark ",

    "these are strong motivations for a verifiable residual presymmetry via partial or complete duplication of standard particles , in a lr symmetric manner to have unified answers to questions left open by the sm .",

    "an alternative residual presymmetry manifested as a lr symmetry is provided by mirror matter models , put forth in ref .   and included here for completeness .",
    "other motivations to consider this possibility are to extend presymmetry from matter to forces and from the electroweak to the strong sector , doubling the particle spectrum completely .    on the one hand , it is the electroweak presymmetry relating chiral quarks and leptons within each of their three families , as explained in sec .",

    "not the two others , remains exact after the underlying charge normalization on fermions .",
    "moreover , it extends to strong interactions for equal gauge couplings of the two color groups .",
    "a residual @xmath44 symmetry then appears , which includes the strong sector , relates every particle with its partner and constrains the corresponding coupling constants to be equal , restoring parity symmetry , just as mirror symmetry in mirror matter models .",
    "consequently , mirror symmetry can be regarded as the verifiable residual presymmetry that is requested .",
    "experimentally testable predictions are obtained from the lrsm or mirror matter models with dirac neutrinos .",

    "but in the lrsm and mirror matter models , they can be both dirac and majorana types in principle , with majorana neutrinos in connection with seesaw mechanisms being the more popular choices .",

    "the charge symmetries between quarks and leptons are explained by the hidden presymmetry underlying the displayed patterns .",
    "yet , it is expanded beyond the sm in order to have an experimentally testable residual presymmetry via partial or complete duplication of standard particles  in a lr symmetric way for the purpose of restoring parity and therefore solving puzzles of the sm coherently .",
    "the doubling is implied by presymmetry apart from the ultraviolet completion of the theory , which substantiates lr symmetry .",
    "this includes the nightmare scenario with no higgs boson .    the relation between presymmetry and lr symmetry",
    "is shown to be so robust that the experimental search for possible parity restoration through lrsm@xcite or mirror matter models@xcite@xmath7@xcite with dirac neutrinos is a test of presymmetry .",
    "this type of neutrinos discriminates , phenomenologically , between the lrsm and mirror matter models supplemented with presymmetry and those without it in which majorana neutrinos are not forbidden .",
    "an experimental evidence for lr symmetry with dirac neutrinos also mean a corroboration of the answer provided by presymmetry to one of the most intricate problems of elementary particle physics : the triplication of families .",
