    "analyzing ensembles of lenses to estimate the mean mass distribution has two advantages over analyzing individual lenses .",

    "the second problem is that several systematic uncertainties have yet to be included in the comparison .",
    "these arise because the distribution of stellar velocities is not gaussian and because galaxies are not spheres , leading to systematic problems when we use the spherical jeans equations to analyze the data .",
    "the systematics are different from local stellar dynamical estimates because the profile slope ( e.g. eqn .",
    "[ eqn : vscale ] ) compares a dynamical mass to a lensing mass rather than comparing two dynamical masses .",

    "two simple examples are the effects of non - gaussian line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvds ) and deviations from spherical symmetry .",
    "while the jeans equations depend on @xmath94 , the measurement is usually the dispersion of the best - fit gaussian , and these two quantities differ by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the dimensionless coefficient of an expansion of the losvd in gauss - hermite polynomials ( e.g. van der marel & franx  @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting corrections , @xmath97 , can be comparable to the formal measurement errors .",
    "for example , romanowsky & kochanek  ( @xcite ) were able to find models of pg1115 + 080 consistent with a flat rotation curve where treu & koopmans  ( @xcite ) , who used only the jeans equations , could not .",
    "arguably the distribution functions required to produce the agreement were unusual , but unusual is a very different statement from impossible .",
    "similarly , galaxies are not spheres . from the virial theorem it is easy to show that an oblate ellipsoid of axis ratio @xmath98 has a ratio between the major and minor axis velocity dispersions that corresponds to a correction of order @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "making hst14176 + 5226 a @xmath100 galaxy viewed pole on leads to corrections large enough to make this system consistent with a nearly flat rather than a rising rotation curve , thereby eliminating the apparent disagreement between this lens and the results of the statistical analysis .",

    "gravitational lens time delays measure a combination of the hubble constant and the surface density @xmath78 in the annulus between the images for which the delay was measured , so if we know @xmath103 then time delays provide a very simple means of breaking the degeneracy in eqn .",

    "[ sec : lens ] , we will discuss only the effects of the radial density distribution .",
    " the effects of the angular distribution are well understood and are reviewed in kochanek  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the key to understanding time delays comes from gorenstein et al .",

    "a useful approximation is to assume that the surface density in the annulus can be _ locally _ approximated by a power law , @xmath105 for @xmath106 , with a mean surface density in the annulus of @xmath78 .",
    "the time delay between the images is then ( kochanek  @xcite ) @xmath107    \\label{eqn : delay1}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the time delay for a singular isothermal sphere with comoving angular diameter distances @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 between the observer , lens and source .",

    "almost all lensing calculations simplify if comoving angular diameter distances are used rather than `` normal '' angular diameter distances , because it is no longer necessary to keep track of the @xmath112 factors in many standard expressions . ]",
    "the key point is that the time delay is largely determined by the average surface density @xmath78 in the annulus with only modest corrections from the local shape of the surface density distribution even when @xmath113 .",
    "the second order expansion is exact for a singular isothermal lens ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) , and it reproduces the time delay of a point mass lens ( @xmath116 ) to better than 1% even when @xmath117 .     estimates for pg1115 + 080 .",
    "the lens galaxy is modeled as an ellipsoidal pseudo - jaffe model , @xmath118 , and the nearby group is modeled as an sis . as the break radius @xmath119 the pseudo - jaffe model becomes an sis model , and as the break radius @xmath120 it becomes a point mass .",
    "the heavy solid curve ( @xmath121 ) shows the dependence of @xmath103 on the break radius for the exact , nonlinear fits of the model to the pg1115 + 080 data .",
    "the heavy dashed curve ( @xmath122 ) is the value found using our simple theory of time delays based on the surface density .",

    "we would have @xmath126 and @xmath127 , as shown by the horizontal line .",
    "when the break radius is large compared to the einstein radius ( indicated by the vertical line ) , the surface density is slightly higher and the slope is slightly shallower than for the sis model because of the added surface density from the group . as we make the lens galaxy more compact by reducing the break radius , the surface density decreases and the slope becomes steeper , leading to a rise in @xmath103 . as the galaxy becomes very compact ,",
    "the surface density near the einstein ring is dominated by the group rather than the galaxy , so the surface density approaches a constant and the logarithmic slope approaches the value corresponding to a constant density sheet ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "[ fig : pg1115],width=384 ]        this relationship between annular surface density and time delays is the fundamental relationship to remember .",
    "a popular parametric example is the scaling of the time delay for global power law models with @xmath129 . in these models the mass density scales as @xmath130 and circular velocities or ray deflections scale as @xmath131 where @xmath115 is the singular isothermal ( sis ) profile producing a flat rotation curve or a constant deflection . in these models",
    "the time delay is @xmath132 to lowest order in @xmath34 ( witt et al .",

    "the interpretation of these delays is controversial ( e.g. williams & saha  @xcite , kochanek  @xcite , koopmans et al .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , but the problem lies mainly with the limitations of the existing data .",
    "the first problem is that several of the lenses are poorly suited to analysis because their photometric structure makes it difficult to perform the accurate astrometry of the images relative to the lens galaxy needed to interpret the delays for any mass distribution .",
    "for example , the quasar images are too bright in b0218 + 357 , the lens is too faint in pks1830211 , and the position estimates depend on accurate corrections for extinction in b1600 + 434 and b1608 + 656 .",
    "the second problem is that many of the delays are not known with sufficient accuracy because the monitoring programs were terminated after the initial delay estimate .",
    "we need time delay measurement accuracies of 5% or better in order to have uncertainties in the surface density @xmath78 that are small compared to the regime of interest ( @xmath135 , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "half of the lenses ( fbq0951 + 2635 , he11041805 , pg1115 + 080 , b1422 + 231 , pks1830211 and he21492745 ) have unacceptably high delay uncertainties .",
    "the third problem is that we have too few systems to adequately understand environmental effects . while keeton & zabludoff  ( @xcite ) somewhat exaggerate the importance of environmental effects on the interpretation of time delays ( much of the spread in their distributions is due to the uncertainties in the time delay measurement rather than the effects of the group ) , it is certainly true that environments affect the interpretation because the parent group or cluster of the lens galaxy contributes to @xmath78 .",
    "for example , b1608 + 656 has two interacting lens galaxies inside the einstein radius and the lens galaxies of rxj0911 + 0551 and q0957 + 561 are members of relatively massive clusters where the cluster potential is important to interpreting the time delays .",
    "in fact , if we assume the two time delay lenses in clusters ( q0957 + 561 and rxj0911 + 0551 ) have similar halo structures to the other lenses , then in order to obtain the same value of @xmath103 as that of the isolated lenses , the clusters must be contributing significantly to the average surface density ( @xmath136@xmath137 ) .",
    "thus , by the time the sample is narrowed to isolated , early - type lenses with good astrometry , good photometry and accurate time delays , almost nothing is left .    as a result",
    ", i find much of the recent debate in lensing circles about time delay lenses to be sterile .",
    "that one person s `` golden lens '' can match the party s value of @xmath103 with a flat rotation curve is largely meaningless when someone else s `` golden lens '' requires a constant mass - to - light ratio to do so unless you can also provide a coherent explanation of why the mass distributions of the two lenses should be different .",
    "hence the philosophy we adopt here  the party says @xmath103 is known and should not be challenged unless you want to count trees in siberia , so we should focus on why we can not produce a coherent story about the structure of lens galaxies at the party s value of @xmath103 before deciding to attempt a revolution .",
    "one possibility , that many delay measurements are less accurate than believed , is easily solved by monitoring the lenses longer .",
    "the other possibility , that the halo structures of early - type galaxies are heterogeneous rather than homogeneous , can be addressed independent of the actual value of @xmath103 .",
    "we can make some initial observations about the homogeneity of halos .",
    "if we take the four relatively isolated bulge - dominated time delay lenses ( pg1115 + 080 , sbs1520 + 530 , b1600 + 434 and he21492745 ) , then we can show that for the same value of @xmath138 , the lenses must have similar mass distributions . for @xmath139  they can have flat rotation curves , while for @xmath140their mass distributions must be nearly constant @xmath141 ( kochanek  @xcite ) . while we can not ( without knowing @xmath103 ) use the time delays to determine which mass distribution is correct , we know that their mass distributions are homogeneous . if we use our surface density formalism , they have mean surface densities of @xmath142 with an upper limit of @xmath143 on the intrinsic scatter in @xmath78 between the halos .",
    "the uncertainties are dominated by the time delay measurement uncertainties for the lenses ( kochanek  @xcite ) .",
    "this result is somewhat puzzling when we compare it to the stellar dynamical results .",
    "treu & koopmans  ( @xcite ) argue that pg1115 + 080 must have a falling rotation curve while the typical lens they have studied has a slightly rising rotation curve ( treu & koopmans  @xcite ) .",
    "but the homogeneity of the surface density estimates based on the time delays indicates that if pg1115 + 080 has a falling rotation curve then sbs1520 + 530 , b1600 + 434 and he21492745 must as well .",
    "it is odd that the typical time delay lens would have a falling rotation curve while the typical stellar dynamical lens would have a rising rotation curve ",
    "the most likely solution is a systematic bias in one of the methods .",
    "this will be easily addressed once we have a larger overlapping sample of galaxies with time delay and velocity dispersion measurements .          and second @xmath144 derivatives of the delay - corrected differential light curves for the lensed images in our monitoring sample with adequate data in mid-2004 .",

    "the solid line shows the relation expected for a point source crossing a fold caustic , and the dashed line shows the lower limit on @xmath144 for a point mass lens .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    at this point i believe the only good solution is to simply measure many more delays with significantly higher accuracies . with 25 accurate ( @xmath145 ) time delays in systems with good ancillary data ( photometry , astrometry )",
    ", it will be relatively simple to determine the heterogeneity or homogeneity of early - type galaxy halos .",
    "the delay sample will also better overlap systems with extra constraints or stellar dynamical measurements .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath103 , time delay measurements are a significantly better probe of the halo structure than either statistical studies or stellar velocity dispersion measurements because they are both more accurate and directly measure the quantity of greatest interest , the surface density in the transition region from luminous to dark matter , @xmath78 .",
    "we have started such a program using the smarts 1.3 m telescope in the south and an array of telescopes in the north ( mdm , flwo , apo @xmath146 ) to monitor roughly 25 lenses 1 - 2 times / week when they are visible . since starting in early 2004",
    "we have measured two new time delays in he04351223 and sdss1004 + 4112 .",
    "we also see an abundance of microlensing variability , whose utility we discuss in  [ sec : micro ] .",

    "[ fig : dm0435 ] shows the results of fitting a model consisting of the luminous lens galaxy and an nfw dark matter halo to he04351223 constrained by the time delay measurement with the hubble constant fixed to @xmath147 .",
    "if we start from a constant @xmath141 model and then reduce the mass of the luminous galaxy while adding the nfw halo , we see the goodness of fit improves with a minimum where the luminous galaxy has only @xmath148 of its mass in the constant @xmath141 model . as we improve the delay from its current 10% accuracy , these uncertainties will shrink more or less proportionately .    the other obvious result from our first season",
    "is that microlensing of lensed quasars is ubiquitous . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcurves ] you can see that the light curves of images a and d in he04351223 are nearly identical while those for b and c look different .",
    "images a and d have the longest delay and are the pair for which we have a time delay measurement . in the first season images b and c were both fading by @xmath149  mag / year relative to a and d due to microlensing .",
    "other light curves , like the ones for sdss0924 + 0129 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcurves ] , show only brightness variations due to microlensing .",
    "collecting and analyzing the microlensing variability is important because it provides our final probe of halo structure using lenses .",
    "microlensing variability depends on both the surface density in stars @xmath150 and the total surface density @xmath151 .",
    "the regime for a standard halo model is that the total surface density is still relatively high ( @xmath152 ) but the stars make up a small fraction of the total ( @xmath153 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : halo ] ) . in this regime , microlensing ( or substructure for that matter ) has a distinctive statistical pattern that strongly distinguishes between images that are saddle points and minima ( schechter & wambsganss  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , there is considerable phase space for significantly demagnifying saddle point images .",
    "the most dramatic example of this is the ( saddle point ) image d of sdss0924 + 0219 , which is almost ten times fainter than expected ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sdss0924 ] ) .",
    "we can already see in the sdss0924 + 0219 light curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : lcurves ] that the images are being microlensed , but if the suppression of image d is due to microlensing we should eventually see it brighten dramatically , overshooting the flux of image a.    because the statistical properties of the microlensing patterns depend on @xmath151 and @xmath75 we can constrain them by analyzing the light curves . in kochanek  ( @xcite )",
    "we developed a method for analyzing microlensing light curves and applied it to the only ( hitherto ) well - monitored lens q2237 + 0305 , focusing on the ogle light curves of wozniak et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . in this system",
    "we see four images of a quasar buried in the bulge of a low redshift spiral galaxy so we would expect to find that @xmath154 , and this is borne out when we analyze the microlensing variability as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kstar ] . even after including all the other uncertainties ( sources sizes , relative velocities @xmath146 ) we find that @xmath155 if we include no prior assumption on the mean stellar masses , and @xmath156 if we force the mean stellar mass to be in the range of @xmath157-@xmath158 .",
    "we do not yet have long enough light curves to make a similar analysis of any other lens , but we are beginning to get there .",
    "[ fig : micro ] shows a crude view of the amount of microlensing , where we estimate the first and second derivatives of the light curves due to microlensing from the data available in mid-2004 .",
    "most images have measurable first and second derivatives that can not be attributed to intrinsic variability .",
    "since we want accurate time delays rather than simply quitting once the delay is measured to 10% , we will be monitoring systems like he04351223 for many more years .",
    "the same longer time baselines are needed to obtain useful constraints on the statistical properties of the magnification pattern produced by the stars .",
    "the microlensing variability can also be used to probe the structure of quasar accretion disks .",
    "for example , even the limited data for sdss0924 + 0219 is sufficient to show that it must have an accretion disk that is significantly smaller than that in q2237 + 0305 , as we might expect from the lower luminosity of sdss0924 + 0219 .",
    "the overall summary of this review is that the future is bright , but the present is painful . on the positive side , we understand the physics of constraining mass distributions with lenses very well . in general , analyses based on image constraints , statistics , velocity dispersions , time delays and microlensing are all generally consistent and indicate that early - type galaxies have appreciable dark matter on intermediate scales ( @xmath159 ) leading to a net mass distribution that is close to isothermal for the typical lens . on the negative side ,",
    "we have not communicated our understanding of how gravitational lenses constrain mass distributions very well .",
    "arguments about methods ( parametric versus non - parametric , statistics versus time delays versus dispersions and so on ) tend to obscure rather than illuminate the underlying unity of the results .",
    "the fundamental question at this point is the degree to which early - type galaxy halos are heterogeneous in their structures on these scales .",
    "most of this is driven by a fairly familiar astronomical problem .",
    "first , there is a preferred , average , naive , straw man , or whatever mass model in which early - type galaxies follow the conspiracy of late - type galaxies and have nearly flat rotation curves with the contribution from the dark matter kicking in just as the contribution from the luminous matter fades .",
    "theoretical halos with the expected baryonic mass fraction would be expected to lie close to this model , usually with a slowly falling rather than a truly flat rotation curve .",
    "second , when we apply the available methods to the lens sample , we find that this is just about right , but there are signs that there is appreciable scatter about the mean . because of small sample sizes , measurement errors and systematic errors we can not yet be sure whether this scatter is real and the halo structure is genuinely heterogeneous or if we have simply underestimated our measurement uncertainties .",
    "this puts the field in a confused state where everyone argues for their object or method but can not produce a synthesis of all the available results to produce a convincing final answer . until we can achieve this synthesis",
    "we will continue to have a problem .",
    "fortunately the way out is straightforward  more data .",
    "no one has found a fundamental flaw in any of the methods .",
    "the problem is simply that the samples are too small and insufficiently overlapping to produce a clear result .",
    "my own feeling is that the method with the least systematic problems for addressing the homogeneity or heterogeneity of early - type galaxy halos is monitoring lenses to measure accurate time delays and comparing the structure of lens galaxies at a fixed value of @xmath103 . for fixed @xmath103 ,",
    "time delays measure the surface density of the galaxy near the lensed images essentially to the accuracy of the time delay measurement , and the surface density near the lensed images is exactly the quantity needed to understand the halo structure .",
    "moreover , the long term monitoring needed to measure accurate time delays also provides microlensing variability light curves that can be used to constrain the fraction of the surface density in the form of stars .",
    "there is a very convenient coincidence that the part of parameter space that should be occupied by the lens galaxies in a standard cdm model also has unique microlensing characteristics .",
