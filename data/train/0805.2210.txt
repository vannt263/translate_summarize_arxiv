    "vacuum fluctuations play an important role in a variety of situations in quantum physics . for instance , the static casimir effect  @xcite originates from vacuum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field and in the electronic states in matter .",
    "if the definition of the vacuum state depends on time due to a time - dependent external condition and the system can not follow the instantaneous vacuum state adiabatically , the vacuum fluctuation materializes as real particles  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is called the nonstationary or dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) .",
    "the dce has been extensively studied  @xcite , especially for photons and the massless scalar field . when the mirror of an optical cavity is rapidly moved  @xcite or the dielectric constant of the matter in a cavity is rapidly altered  @xcite , photons are created in the cavity even if the initial state of the electromagnetic field is in the vacuum state .",
    "the generated photons are in a squeezed state  @xcite , which modifies the casimir force exerted on the mirrors  @xcite . the finite temperature correction to the dce  @xcite and decoherence via the dce  @xcite",
    "have also been studied . since there is no intrinsic hamiltonian in the original formulation of the moving mirror problem  @xcite ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian approach has been developed  @xcite .",
    "we have derived an effective hamiltonian for the moving mirror problem by quantizing both the electromagnetic field and the polarization field in the mirrors  @xcite .    however , photon creation by the dce has not yet been experimentally observed .",
    "this is because the mirror of a cavity must be vibrated at a frequency of the order of ghz ( at least for a microwave cavity ) in order to resonantly amplify the photon field  @xcite .",
    "recently , the infn group  @xcite proposed a method to detect the dce using a semiconductor layer illuminated by laser pulses , which enables the rapid displacement of the position of the cavity mirror .",
    "the proposed experiment using this method , however , has not been completed to date .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose a novel system to realize the dce : a bose einstein condensate ( bec ) of an ultracold atomic gas with spin degrees of freedom . in this system",
    ", magnons are created through the dce . the time - dependent external condition that causes the dce corresponds to the time - dependent magnetic field applied to the bec . unlike in the case of photons , the typical energy of magnons in a bec for a magnetic field of @xmath0 g is @xmath1 hz ( @xmath2 : planck constant ) .",
    "magnetic field modulation at this frequency is experimentally feasible .",
    "continuous amplification of magnons by an oscillating magnetic field leads to magnetization of the system , which can be observed by _ in situ _",
    "measurements  @xcite .    in a broad sense , quasiparticle excitations in a nonstationary bec",
    "may be regarded as the dce .",
    "for example , a time dependent trapping potential  @xcite , a rapid increase in the interatomic interaction  @xcite , and collapse of a bec by an attractive interaction  @xcite generate bogoliubov quasiparticles . in these cases ,",
    "the bec itself is also excited and its shape depends on time , whose dynamics is described by the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "however , it is difficult to distinguish the quasiparticle excitation from the mean - field excitation , and therefore these systems are unsuitable for demonstrating the dce .",
    "in contrast , in our model , the time - dependent magnetic field excites only the vacuum fluctuation in the initial quasiparticle vacuum state , giving an ideal testing ground for the dce .",
