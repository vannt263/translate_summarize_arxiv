    "high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) results from the interaction of an intense laser with atoms or molecules .",
    "hhg provides a mechanism for generating coherent extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) and x - ray attosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "the three - step model was established to describe the physical processes of hhg @xcite : the strong laser field tilts the binding potential and the electron escapes from the charged core of the atom or molecule through quantum tunneling ; the electron is then accelerated in the free space by the laser field ; when the electron recollides with the charged core , a very energetic photon is emitted .",
    "recently high - order teraherz sideband generation ( hsg ) in semiconductors was predicted @xcite , which has a physical mechanism similar to hhg but occurs at a very different frequency range . in semiconductors",
    ", an electron can be excited from the valance band to the conduction band with a hole left behind .",
    "the recollisions between energetic holes and electrons accelerated by a strong thz field result in hsg .",
    "recently , hsg has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the excitonic effect has also been theoretically studied @xcite .",
    "a fundamental difference between hhg in atoms and hsg in semiconductors is that the electron - hole ( e - h ) pairs in hsg are elementary excitations caused by nir lasers . in hhg , the electrons need to overcome the binding energy by quantum tunneling and therefore the quantum trajectories that satisfy the least action condition have only complex solutions . in hsg",
    ", the laser frequency @xmath0 can be tuned from below to above the semiconductor bandedge @xmath1 , and correspondingly , the initial energy of the e - h pairs generated by the nir laser can be tuned from negative to positive relative to the bandedge . particularly , for e - h pairs with positive excess energy ( @xmath2 , corresponding to `` negative '' binding energy of atoms in hhg ) , the e - h pairs can be directly created by real excitation without quantum tunneling , and in turn the quantum trajectories may have real solutions . on the other hand ,",
    "the laser can be tuned so high above the band edge that the initial velocities of the e - h pairs are too high for the thz field to drive electrons and holes into recollision .",
    "then recombination of e - h pairs has to occur through quantum tunneling ( c.f .",
    "quantum tunneling in creation of e - h pairs for laser tuned below band edge ) .",
    "therefore , there will also be a cutoff of hsg on the excitation laser frequency .",
    "such consideration motivates us to investigate the dependence of the hsg in semiconductors , in particular , its plateau features , on the frequency of the nir laser .",
    "we calculate the hsg for various excitation laser frequencies and examine the plateau features .",
    "the hsg spectrum is explained by quantum trajectories in the three - step model .",
    "the previous studies on hsg for negative detuning ( @xmath3 ) show that the maximal and minimal orders of the sideband plateau are given by the cut - off law @xcite    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the ponderomotive energy , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the strength and frequency of the thz field , respectively .",
    "the laser detuning @xmath8 plays a role similar to the binding energy in atoms for hhg @xcite .",
    "the cut - off frequencies can be derived from a classical calculation with the assumption that the electrons tunnel to the conduction band with zero initial velocity . in this paper",
    ", we will show that for positive laser detuning ( @xmath2 ) the hsg plateau cutoffs do not satisfy the eqs .",
    "( [ e0a ] ) and ( [ e0b ] ) and depend on the detuning .",
    "this characteristic indicates that the hsg spectrum may be modified by tuning the frequency of the excitation laser .",
    "under an intense thz field , the kinetic energy acquired by the e - h pair can be much greater than the exciton binding energy in the semiconductor and the amplitude of the relative motion can be much greater than the exciton radius , so the essential physics of the hsg can be grasped by the motion of free electrons and holes without coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the equation of relative motion for the electron - hole pair without coulomb interaction is @xcite @xmath9\\psi ( \\mathbf{r},t ) + \\mathbf{d}\\cdot \\mathbf{e}(t ) \\delta(\\mathbf{r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the momentum and the interband dipole matrix element , respectively .",

    "here we have assumed that the electron and the hole are generated at the same position ( @xmath14 ) and the dipole matrix element @xmath11 is a constant independent of the momentum .",
    "the optical polarization of the e - h pair is @xmath15 .",

    "the action @xmath23 is a phase introduced by the motion of the e - h pair with canonical momentum @xmath10 . due to the inversion symmetry , only the even - order sidebands ( with even @xmath19 )",
    "can be generated  @xcite .    for a strong thz field ,",
    "the e - h pair performs relative motion with amplitude much greater than its wavepacket diffusion range .",
    "therefore the motion is well grasped by a few quantum trajectories that satisfy the stationary phase conditions .",
    "the stationary - phase points are determined by a set of saddle - point equations    @xmath24 ^ 2 = \\omega -e_g~,\\label{e7 } \\\\ \\partial_t s = 0 & \\longrightarrow & [ \\mathbf{p}-\\mathbf{a}(t)]^2 - [ \\mathbf{p}-\\mathbf{a}(t-\\tau)]^2 = n\\omega_0~.\\label{e8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the physical meanings of these equations are : eq .

    "( [ e7 ] )  energy conservation at the excitation of the e - h pair ; eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] )  energy conservation for the sideband generation through recombination of the e - h pair .",
    "the laser detuning @xmath25 determines the mechanism of the e - h generation and recombination ( with or without quantum tunneling ) . if @xmath26 , the electron enters into the continuum via quantum tunneling assisted by the strong thz field .",
    "the tunneling physics results in complex solutions of @xmath27 and @xmath22 , which in turn leads to reduced hsg intensity .",
    "when @xmath28 , real excitation of e - h pairs is possible and so are real solutions of @xmath27 and @xmath22 . without requiring quantum tunneling through a binding energy barrier , the hsg can have large amplitudes .",
    "however , if the initial energy and hence the initial relative velocity of the e - h pair are too large ( @xmath29 ) , the thz field would not be able to drive the electron and the hole back to the same position . then only through quantum tunneling",
    "can the e - h pair recombine , which means the saddle point equations would not have real solutions .",
    "so the hsg amplitude will be large when the excitation energy @xmath30 and drops rapidly outside this range  the hsg presents a plateau feature not only in the emission spectrum but also in the excitation spectrum .",
    "moreover , as we will show below , the hsg emission plateau depends on the laser excitation frequency .    substituting eq .",
