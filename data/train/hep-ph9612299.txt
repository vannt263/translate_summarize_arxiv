    "in supersymmetric theories the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking remains a fundamental open problem .",
    "its low energy manifestation is the supersymmetric spectrum .",
    "therefore , one may hope to get some insight into this problem from experiment .",
    "currently , the most popular view on supersymmetry breaking is that the parameters of the low energy effective theory have their origin in the gut ( or string ) scale physics @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in an invisible sector and this effect is transferred to our sector through supergravity interactions at the scale @xmath4 .",
    "other models have also been proposed @xcite in which the supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the electroweak sector through some other messengers at the energy scale @xmath5 . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters at the large scale are connected to their low energy values via the renormalization group equations ( rge ) which do not contain any new unknown parameters . with any simple theoretical _ ansatz _ for the pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking terms at the scale where supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the observable sector one can study superpartner spectra in the top - down approach .",
    "it is clear that any particular _ ansatz _ for parameters at high energy scale gives only a small subspace of all low energy parameter space . in order to have a broad overview of the low energy - high energy parameter mapping it is of interest to supplement the top - down approach with a bottom - up one where we can learn how certain qualitative features of the low energy spectra reflect themselves on the qualitative pattern of soft terms at different energy scales",
    "of course , eventual measurement of the superpartner and higgs boson spectra and various mixing angles in the sfermion sector will permit ( in the framework of mssm ) a complete bottom@xmath6up mapping .",
    "we shall know then the pattern of the soft parameters at any hypothetical scale @xmath7 of supersymmetry breaking and this will have major impact on our ideas on its origin .    this talk is based on results obtained in reference @xcite .",
    "we present here the main features of the bottom@xmath6up mapping for the set of parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the third generation squark mass parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . to a very good approximation",
    "this is a closed set of parameters , whose rg running decouples from the remaining parameters .",
    "regime , the dependence of the rg running of these parameters on slepton ( and the two first generation sfermion ) masses comes only through the small hypercharge d - term contributions which we neglect here .",
    "their contribution can be found in @xcite .",
    "] we shall concentrate on the region of small to moderate values of @xmath0 in which , for @xmath17 gev , the bottom quark yukawa coupling effects may be neglected . for this case",
    "we present analytic expressions ( at one loop level ) for the values of our set at @xmath18 and at any @xmath19 in terms of its values at @xmath20 scale .",
    "the equations are valid for arbitrary boundary values of the parameters at the scale @xmath7 .    in absence of direct experimental measurement of the low energy parameters ,",
    "we disscuss the mapping of the region characterized by light chargino and right handed stop with masses of the order of @xmath20 which is consistent with all existing experimental constraints and is of interest for lep2 .",
    "the bottom  up mapping is presented in section 2 .",
    "section 3 containes some general results obtained with this method and its application to the low energy region with light chargino and stop .",
    "more detailed presentation of the bottom  up mapping and more results can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "we write down first the approximate solutions to the rg equations in the low and moderate @xmath0 regime ( i.e. neglecting the effects of yukawa couplings other than the top quark one ) for the relevant parameters . for our purpose , it is useful to give the expression of the high energy parameters as a function of the low energy ones .",

    ". moreover , the functions @xmath78 and @xmath43 defined by eqs.([eqn : y],[eqn : yf ] ) are auxiliary functions defined for any scale @xmath7 .",
    "the function @xmath78 is very convenient in presenting the solutions to the rg equations .",
    "the whole dependence of the results on the large top yukawa coupling can be easily expressed in terms of @xmath79 ( see eqs .  ( [ eqn : m2ov0][eqn : mu0 ] ) ) . for @xmath25 a consistent perturbative treatment of the theory",
    "can only be performed if @xmath80 where @xmath81 defines the quasi infrared fixed point solution . for scenarios with supersymmetry broken at lower scales @xmath82 , the same values of @xmath83 and @xmath0 ( or equivalently of @xmath84 )",
    "give obviously much lower values for the auxiliary function @xmath78 , where @xmath85 is defined at the scale @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",

    "new complete @xmath88 or @xmath89 multiplets do not destroy the unification of gauge couplings but their value at the unification scale becomes larger and , correspondingly , the perturbativity bound , @xmath90 , allows for larger values of the top quark yukawa coupling ( smaller @xmath0 ) at the @xmath20 scale .",
    "we shall use the auxiliary function @xmath78 when presenting our results .",
    "we recall that our theoretical intuition about the superpartner spectrum has been to a large extent developed on the top - down approach in the minimal supergravity model ( with universal soft terms ) and on minimal models of low energy supersymmetry breaking .",

    "the exact values of the coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : mz_univ],[eqn : mq_univ ] ) depend slightly on the values of @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath18 chosen . ]",
    "@xmath94 where @xmath66 and @xmath95 are the universal gaugino and scalar mass parameters ( at the high energy scale ) respectively .",
    "the large coefficient in front of @xmath96 is the well known source of fine tuning for @xmath97 and therefore one naturally expects light neutralino and chargino both gaugino - like since , from ( [ eqn : mz_univ ] ) , @xmath98 @xcite . for moderate values of the parameters at the gut scale ,",
    "the rg evolution of the squark masses gives @xmath99 where ellipsis stand for terms proportional to @xmath100 and @xmath101 with coefficients going to zero in the limit @xmath102 .",
    "we see that the hierarchy @xmath103 can be generated provided @xmath104 , i.e. consistently with naturality criterion . for large enough values of the universal trilinear soft terms , @xmath105 , one",
    "may even obtain @xmath106 and in consequence @xmath107 , @xmath108 and gaugino - like @xcite .",
    "of course , _ anstze _ for soft terms at high energy scale such as full universality or partial universality selects only a small subset of the low energy parameter space , even if the latter is assumed to contain light chargino and stop and to be characterized by the hierarchy @xmath109 .",
    "since the sparticle spectrum with @xmath110 and @xmath109 is important for lep2 and at the same time consistent with the precision electroweak data @xcite , it is of interest to study the mapping of such a spectrum to high energies in a general way and to understand better its consistency ( or inconsistency ) with various simple patterns .",
    "we shall discuss now some general features of the behaviour of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters , which may be extracted from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : m2ov0]-[eqn : mu0 ] ) .",
    "we consider first the case @xmath25 and the limit @xmath111 as a useful reference frame .",
    "one should be aware , however , that already for @xmath112@xmath113 large qualitative departures from the results associated with this limit are possible . in the limit @xmath111 , from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : m2ov0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : at0 ] ) , we see that if the high energy parameters are of the same order of magnitude as the low energy ones , the following relations must be fulfilled : @xmath114 irrespectively of their initial values ( ir fixed point ) .",
    "this is a well known prediction , which , for @xmath115 , remains valid in the gaugino dominated supersymmetry breaking scenario in the minimal supergravity model .",
    "let us now suppose that the relations ( [ eqn : sumrule ] ) are strongly violated by experiment , namely the scalar masses ( or the soft supersymmetry breaking parameter @xmath16 ) are much different than predicted by ( [ eqn : sumrule ] ) , for the values of @xmath83 and @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath84 close to 1 .",
    "clearly , this means that @xmath116 i.e. supersymmetry breaking must be driven by very large initial scalar masses and the magnitude of the effect depends on the departure from the fixed point relations for @xmath16 and @xmath117 , eq.([eqn : sumrule ] ) , and the proximity to the top quark mass infrared fixed point solution measured by @xmath118 . moreover , for not very small values of @xmath119 and/or @xmath120 it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : m2k0 ] ) that in the limit @xmath111 , independently of the actual values of the masses at the scale @xmath20 , their initial values are correlated such that @xmath121 and @xmath122 is much smaller than the above three soft masses . in other words , the values at @xmath20 are obtained ( via rges ) by a very high degree of fine tuning between the initial values @xmath123 .",
    "we conclude that eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : sumrule ] ) are necessary ( but of course not sufficient ) conditions for large departures from the prediction ( [ eqn : fprel ] ) for the soft scalar masses in the limit @xmath124 . in particular , they are necessary conditions for the spectrum consistent with fully ( or partially ) universal initial values of the third generation squark and higgs boson soft masses .    when eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : sumrule ] ) are violated , there are essentially two ways of departing from the prediction ( [ eqn : fprel ] ) .",
    "one is to increase the value of @xmath0 ( i.e. to decrease the top quark yukawa coupling for fixed @xmath83 ) .",
    "the other way is to lower the scale at which supersymmetry breaking is transferred to the observable sector , since for @xmath125 the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters do not feel the strong rise of the top quark yukawa coupling at scales close to @xmath18 . in both cases",
    ", @xmath79 takes values smaller than one and we can depart from ( [ eqn : fprel ] ) even when ( [ eqn : sumrule ] ) are not satisfied .",
    "we shall illustrate the above general considerations by numerical bottom  up mapping of the low energy parameter space characterized as follows : @xmath126 gev , @xmath127 gev ( the pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking parameters does not depend strongly on the exact value of the light chargino and stop masses ) , @xmath128 for both signs of @xmath8 . to reduce the parameter space , in our numerical analysis",
    "we make the assumption that @xmath129 at any scale . for @xmath130 gev , @xmath131 we consider two examples : @xmath132 gev , @xmath133 ( corresponding to @xmath134 ) and @xmath135 gev , @xmath136 ( corresponding to @xmath137 ) .",
    "we scan over the remaining relevant parameters @xmath138 , @xmath139 tev , and the whole range of @xmath75 .",
    "the accepted low energy parameter space is then defined as a subspace in which @xmath140 gev , @xmath141 , and we also require that @xmath142 where @xmath143 is for the fit to the elctroweak observables which do not involve heavy flavors .    in figure 1",
    "we show the dependence of @xmath144 on the value of @xmath66 and the behaviour of the soft supersymmetry breaking higgs mass parameters in the infrared limit : @xmath145 ( masses are defined by @xmath146 ) . a clear concentration of solutions around @xmath147 and @xmath148 appears .",
    "the above ratios are governed by the size of the gaugino masses . for low values of @xmath66 , the maximum value of @xmath144 is given by @xmath149 , while for solutions with large values of @xmath150(1 tev )",
    ", @xmath151 is possible .",
    "similarly , values of @xmath152 may only appear for large values of the gaugino masses , while low values of the gaugino masses always lead to @xmath153 .",
    "for @xmath154 , a strong concentration of solutions around the boundary values is observed .",
    "such behaviour of the solutions is just a reflaction of the properties discussed above for @xmath79 close to 1 and shows the global tendency in the mapping of the low energy region selected by our criteria .",
    "_ figure 2 : same as figure 1 , but for @xmath155 gev , @xmath79=0.75 .",
    "_    figure 2 shows the solutions obtained for low supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath155 gev and for @xmath156 .",
    "the value of @xmath79 is now much smaller than 1 and the violation of the sum rules , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sumrule ] ) , does not imply an enhancement of the values of the parameters at the scale @xmath7 . from the analysis of our equations , for these low values of @xmath7 and @xmath78",
    ", it follows that the initial values of soft terms at the scale @xmath7 tend to reflect the pattern observed at the @xmath20 scale . due to",
    "the small renormalization group running effects and the fact that @xmath157 , the ratio @xmath158 is just a reflection of the chosen values of the left handed stop parameter and the gluino mass at low energies , increasing for lower values of @xmath66 .",
    "more interesting is the behaviour of @xmath144 .",
    "the concentration of solutions around @xmath159 disappears for this low values of @xmath79 and , instead , the ratio @xmath144 tends , in general , to be lower .",
    "hence , a light stop is not necessarily in conflict with models of supersymmetry breaking in which @xmath160 at the scale @xmath7 . figure 2 shows that for susy breaking scale of order @xmath161 gev , the three soft masses @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 can have similar values for many solutions , especially for light gauginos .",
    "the second soft higgs mass , @xmath165 , tends to be rather light but the full universality can also be easily obtained .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the mapping to high energies of the low energy parameters of the mssm .",
    "we investigated the specific region in low energy parameter space with light chargino and right - handed stop which can be interested for lep2 . for heavy top quark and small or moderate @xmath0 the global pattern of the mapping",
    "is determined by the proximity of the top quark yukawa coupling to its ir fixed point value and by the assumed scale at which supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the observable sector .",
    "the general pattern of this mapping is the dominance of the scalar masses ( over the gaugino mass ) in the supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we have also identified the conditions which are necessary for the spectrum to be consistent with a simple _ ansatz _ like universality ( or partial universality ) of the high energy values for the scalar masses .",
    "in particular , the @xmath166type initial conditions , with universal squark masses but with non - universal higgs masses are compatible with an interesting subregion of the considered parameter space .",
