    "most galaxies are not isolated ( tully 1987 ) but are members of groups or clusters which are gravitationally bound , though not necessarily virialised . galaxies in such systems",
    "may experience a number of types of interaction with their environment : galaxy - galaxy encounters , which may trigger starbursts and can culminate in galaxy merging ( schweizer 1982 ) , interaction with the potential of the system as a whole , which may for example , result in tidal stripping of loosely bound material from galaxy outskirts ( mamon 1987 ) , and finally hydrodynamical interaction between the interstellar medium ( ism ) in a galaxy , and any intergalactic gas trapped in the potential well of the galaxy system .",
    "it is the last of these processes which is the subject of the present study .",
    "interaction with the surrounding intracluster medium ( icm ) may have a significant impact on the gas within a galaxy whenever it sweeps through a substantial mass of hot gas in its motion within a group or cluster . in practice",
    ", the hot icm dominates the baryon content of galaxy clusters ( white & fabian 1995 ) and is also a major baryonic component within many galaxy groups ( mulchaey _ et al . _",
    "1996 , ponman _",
    "et al . _",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the interaction between galaxies and the icm should generate characteristic structures : at low galaxy velocities it will produce only a mild displacement of the outer regions of any gaseous galaxy halo , at higher velocities a bow shock should be generated ahead of the galaxy , and a wake of enhanced gas density may trail behind it .",
    "these processes are important for three main reasons : first , gas may be removed from and/or accreted by the galaxy in such interactions with its gaseous environment , with important implications for subsequent galaxy evolution .",
    "second , such processes will be responsible for some or all of the metals which are observed today within the icm in clusters and groups , and may also affect the energetics of the icm ( ponman , cannon & navarro 1999 )  as such they are important for an understanding of the structure and evolution of galaxy systems .",
    "finally , structures such as galaxy wakes provide information about the direction of motion of galaxies on the plane of the sky , which has in general been unavailable previously ( merrifield 1998 ) . given a good understanding of the astrophysics of the interaction , one may also be able to deduce the magnitude of the galaxy s total velocity ( allowing a full dynamical solution ) and also to constrain the total mass of galaxies , including any dark halo .",
    "given the velocities of galaxies in groups and clusters , the temperature of the gas in shocks and wakes will be @xmath2k , so the observational evidence of such processes is best sought at x - ray energies . to date shock and wake structures have only been observed in a few instances ( detailed below ) , due to the limited sensitivity of existing x - ray telescopes .",
    "however , the improvements available from the upcoming x - ray observatories ,  and will enable detailed studies of structures around galaxies within clusters to be conducted .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to prepare for this , by exploring the astrophysics of the galaxy - icm interaction using numerical hydrodynamic simulations , and in particular to investigate the observable properties of such interactions in the x - ray band .",
    "the astrophysics is quite complex ",
    "several different mechanisms may be at work in any particular galaxy , and these will potentially have different signatures .",
    "examples of such mechanisms include : i ) a bow - shock , if the galaxy is moving supersonically through the icm then there is the likelihood of a bow - shock preceeding the galaxy ; ii ) a gravitationally focussed wake , the mass and motion of the galaxy will tend to concentrate material behind it , in an analogous manner to bondi - hoyle accretion in binary systems ( _ c.f._hunt 1971 ) ; iii ) ram pressure stripping of gas in the galaxy by the icm will also result in a tail of enhanced density behind the galaxy .",
    "this feature , in the case of m86 , has also been referred to as an x - ray plume ( rangarajan _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) .",
    "examples of these features can be seen later in simulations of the galaxy / icm interaction . while a bow - shock will be a distinct and recognisable feature , distinguishing between wakes ( formed by gravitational focussing ) and tails formed by stripping might be difficult on morphological grounds . in this paper",
    "we identify spectral as well as morphological signatures that can be used as a diagnostic of the physical mechanisms at work .",
    "currently there is only a limited amount of evidence of bow - shocks , wakes and tails around galaxies , observed primarily in relatively local systems .",
    "some examples are :    1 .",
    "white _ et al . _  ( 1991 ) reported on  observations of the virgo galaxy m86 , finding evidence for an x - ray plume , caused by ram pressure stripping as the galaxy moves through the cluster icm .",
    "et al . _  ( 1995 ) analysed  observations of m86 , finding that the x - ray plume , which they also interpret as being due to ram - pressure stripping , has a higher metallicity than either the cluster or m86 itself .",
    "the plume temperature is @xmath3 , similar to the galaxy emission from m86 , but substantially lower than the cluster .",
    "david _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1994 ) reported on  observations of a linear structure behind the dominant galaxy in the ngc5044 group .",
    "they interpreted these results as being due to a cooling wake  behind the galaxy , caused by motion of the galaxy with respect to the hot gas which follows the potential of the galaxy group .",
    "irwin & sarazin ( 1996 ) reported on  hri observations of the virgo cluster elliptical galaxy ngc4472 , which shows a distorted x - ray morphology .",
    "irwin & sarazin ( 1996 ) suggested that this was strong evidence for a bow - shock like structure around the galaxy .",
    "sakelliou , merrifield & mchardy ( 1996 ) reported on results on observations of the wide - angled tail galaxy 4c  34.16 which lies in a poor cluster .",
    "radio maps show two tails bent into a wide c - shape , and x - ray observations show an enhancement between the tails .",
    "et al . _  ( 1996 ) interpret this as due to motion of the galaxy through the icm , and that this motion is responsible for both the jet bending and the x - ray wake trailing the galaxy .",
    "the fornax elliptical galaxy ngc1404 shows an x - ray tail pointing away from the cluster centre , indicating that galaxy is infalling ( jones _ et al . _",
    ".   observations of the coma cluster found an elongated x - ray structure around the giant elliptical galaxy ngc4839 ( dow & white 1995 ) .",
    "ngc4839 is probably the cd galaxy of a subcluster that is currently infalling into the main cluster .",
    "the x - ray tail of ngc4839 is pointing away from the main cluster centre , supporting the infall idea .",
    "h@xmath4 observations of the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc4388 by veilleux _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) have found evidence of supersonic ram - pressure stripping .",
    "ngc4388 is moving at @xmath5 with respect to the icm of the virgo cluster , with a mach number of @xmath6 .",
    "the x - ray emission from ngc4388 is extended in the plane of the galaxy ( matt _ et al . _",
    "1994 ) but there is no evidence of x - ray extensions associated with ram - pressure stripping ( though as veilleux _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) point out , the galaxy orientation is unfavourable ) .",
    "there have been a several papers considering the gas - dynamics of a galaxy moving through a cluster since the issue was considered by gunn & gott ( 1972 ) .",
    "shaviv & salpeter ( 1982 ) reported on simulations , concentrating on the role of galaxy motion in ram - pressure stripping .",
    "further simulations of the galaxy / icm interaction have been presented by takeda , nulsen & fabian ( 1984 ) , who presented results of the dynamics of a galaxy moving radially through a cluster , suffering periodic stripping in the higher density regions near the centre of a cluster .",
    "other studies of ram - pressure stripping have been presented by nulsen ( 1982 ) and portnoy , pistinner & shaviv ( 1993 ) , as well as the work of abadi , moore & bower ( 1999 ) , which concentrates on the effect of ram - pressure stripping in clusters on the truncation of disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "the two most relevant papers to this work are those by gaetz , salpeter & shaviv ( 1987 ) and balsara , livio & odea ( 1994 ) .",
    "_  ( 1987 ) presented a comprehensive study of ram - pressure stripping from galaxies , and calculated several important parameters affecting the efficiency of stripping .",
    "we shall use some of the parameters defined by gaetz _",
    "et al . _  ( 1987 ) in this paper .",
    "et al . _  ( 1994 ) present further calculations , using more sophisticated numerical techniques .",
    "importantly , they found that the stripping process was much more complicated than seen in the calculations of gaetz _",
    "et al._(1987 ) .",
    "when there was significant mass - replenishment of the ism within the galaxy the resulting dynamical structure was complex , with material being stripped from the galaxy in long streamers from the edge of the galaxy , with the stripping happening is a discontinuous , episodic manner .",
    "the calculations presented here represent an improvement over those of gaetz _ et al . _  ( 1987 ) and balsara _ et al . _  ( 1994 ) for the following reasons .",
    "the gaetz _",
    "_  ( 1987 ) paper used a rather old numerical hydrodynamics code , which has substantial numerical viscosity .",
    "this has the effect of smearing out smaller scale features found in runs using more recent numerical hydrodynamic computer codes , such as the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) .",
    "this is important as in many runs the stripping process occurs in discrete events , with material being stripped of the edges of the galaxy .",
    "it is likely that in the gaetz _",
    "et al . _  ( 1987 ) models these processes were not be resolved .",
    "_  ( 1994 ) used a more sophisticated code ( ppm - essentially the same as used in this paper ) .",
    "however , balsara _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1994 ) used a large value for the mass - replenishment rate ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "a large value of @xmath7 has the advantage of highlighting the complex dynamics of the galaxy / icm interaction , but care has to be taken not to make it unrealistically large ( see section  [ sec2p3p3 ] ) .",
    "there are two further areas where this work is a significant improvement .",
    "first , from the simulations we calculate synthetic flux and hardness maps , as well as surface brightness profiles .",
    "these synthetic results can then be compared directly to actual observations of structures around galaxies in clusters .",
    "such an approach will be necessary to fully understand the observed structures .",
    "second , we perform a broad ranging parameter study , for parameters appropriate for a range of clusters , ranging from cool clusters or groups ( with an icm temperature of @xmath8 ) , up to hot clusters ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the main purposes of this paper are twofold .",
    "first , to identify observational signatures of the galaxy / icm interaction , which can be used in future detailed studies of individual objects , and second , to identify the circumstances in which galaxy / icm interactions are most likely to be visible .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we discuss the hydrodynamical model used to investigate the phenomenon , including the model for the galaxy and the parameters used in the simulations . in section  [ sec3 ] results from the simulations are presented and compared with analytic models of the galaxy / icm interaction , in section  [ sec4 ] the observable signatures of these simulations are discussed , and in section  [ sec5 ] we discuss these results in the context of observations and conclude .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : x2 ]      in galaxies a combination of stellar mass loss and supernovae act to continuously replenish the gas within the galaxy .",
    "this mass - replenishment will affect the flow around the galaxy in several ways .",
    "first , it provides material that can be continuously stripped and second , it acts as barrier ( if dense enough ) to the icm , resulting in the formation of a bow - shock preceeding the galaxy . in these simulations the radial distribution of the mass replenishment",
    "is assumed to have basically the same form as that of the stellar distribution , that is    @xmath10    for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the outer radius for mass - replenishment .",
    "the characteristic radius @xmath13 is the mass replenishment half - radius - half of the mass - replenishment occurs inside a radius @xmath13 .",
    "this prescription is equivalent to case 1  in gaetz _",
    "et al . _  ( 1987 ) .",
    "this expression can be integrated to give an expression for the total mass - injection rate within the galaxy    @xmath14 \\ .\\ ] ]    the value of @xmath15 is determined by the assumed total rate of mass injection into the galaxy @xmath7 . assuming a galactic mass / light ratio of 20 ( in solar units ) gives @xmath16 for the model galaxy .",
    "this mass / light ratio implies a modest dark matter halo .",
    "faber & gallagher ( 1976 ) estimated that the rate of mass - replenishment into an elliptical galaxy was @xmath17 , so the expected mass - replenishment rate for a @xmath18 galaxy is @xmath19 . as discussed by gaetz _",
    "et al . _  ( 1987 ) , the relationship of faber & gallagher ( 1976 ) was estimated assuming a single coeval populations of stars , with a current main sequence turn - off mass of @xmath20 .",
    "younger populations of stars will enhance the mass - replenishment rate , and so the value of @xmath21 should be considered as a lower limit . the results of mathews ( 1989 ) suggest a value of @xmath22 as a reasonable upper limit , when there is mass - replenishment from a younger stellar population .",
    "consequently , two sets of simulations with @xmath23 and @xmath24 have been calculated .",
    "the temperature of the replenished gas is assumed to be @xmath25k , the same as in balsara _",
    "et al . _  ( 1994 ) and gaetz _ et al . _  ( 1987 ) .",
    "we note that balsara _",
    "et al . _  ( 1994 ) used a rather high value of the mass - replenishment rate ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "such a large value leads automatically to the formation of dense structures in the centre of the galaxy .",
    "however , even with lower values of @xmath7 , under some circumstances , dense and complex structures are formed within the galaxy .      in several of the simulations presented in section  [ sec3 ] a considerable amount of cold , dense gas accumulates in the centre of the galaxy .",
    "we include the possibility of star - formation in the simulations , in an identical way to balsara _",
    "_  ( 1994 ) , which is essentially as a mass - sink in the centre of the galaxy . no feedback mechanisms ( _ i.e._the formation of a young stellar population leading to an increase in the mass - replenishment rate ) is included .",
    "such refinements could be easily included in more sophisticated models .    as implemented here",
    "the action of star - formation is to remove gas from the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "material is assumed to form stars or molecular clouds and effectively drops out of the hydrodynamic equations . when star - formation does occur the rate of change of gas density is given by ;    @xmath27\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left(1+\\tanh\\left[\\frac{t_{sf}-t}{0.1t_{sf } } \\right]\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this equation @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the effective density and temperature thresholds above which and below which star - formation will occur .",
    "the star - formation time - scale @xmath30 specifies the time - scale on which the star - formation occurs . in these simulations @xmath31 , @xmath32k , and @xmath33 years .    in our simulations",
    "star - formation only occurs in a subset of the runs ( see section  [ sec3 ] ) , and when it does occur it only happens in the innermost regions of the galaxy .",
    "star - formation , as implemented here , does not have any substantial effect on the flow - properties outside of these inner regions , but it does prevent the densities in the central region of the galaxy growing , unchecked , to unphysical levels .",
    "a total of 12 simulations have been run , four each for the cool , intermediate and hot clusters , with two values for the galaxy velocity and mass - replenishment rate . details of the parameters for each model are given in table  [ tab : x3 ] .",
    "the simulations were all run on a @xmath34 2-d cylindrical grid , with an extent of @xmath35 cm by @xmath36 cm ( @xmath37kpc ) . at an assumed cluster distance of 50mpc",
    "each cell corresponds to an angular extent of 1.3  arcsec .",
    "gaetz _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1987 ) introduced some parameters and timescales that are useful to characterise these simulations .",
    "the flow - crossing timescale is defined as    @xmath38    for the range of velocities considered @xmath39 is in the range @xmath40yr .",
    "the characteristic orbital timescale within the galaxy is defined as    @xmath41    with    @xmath42    with @xmath43 the total mass - contained within a radius @xmath13 . for the model galaxy @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 , and @xmath46yr .    an important quantity in these simulations",
    "will be the fraction of mass retained by the galaxy in the gas - phase and the amount of gas ram - pressure stripped from the galaxy .",
    "et al . _  ( 1987 ) parameterised the fraction of mass ram - pressure stripped from the galaxy using two parameters , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where    @xmath49    with @xmath50 the icm density and @xmath51 the escape velocity from the galaxy at a radius @xmath13 is    @xmath52    with @xmath53 the gravitational potential .",
    "for the parameters used here @xmath54 ( table  [ tab : x2 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 is the ratio of the external to internal mass - flow rate into the galaxy , and @xmath48 a dimensionless measure of galaxy velocity . with these two parameters gaetz",
    "_  ( 1987 ) defined a dimensionless stripping parameter @xmath55 that related directly to the fraction of mass - stripped from the galaxy ( their fig .",
    "3 ) . consequently",
    ", the rate of ram - pressure stripping is @xmath56 .    from the simulations we calculate the fraction of the replenished gas that is retained by the galaxy ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we estimate the mass of gas @xmath58 within a radius @xmath13 at two times @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 chosen to lie at times where the solution has settled down to a steady state ( or at least a quasi - steady state - see section  [ sec3p2 ] ) .",
    "we then define @xmath57 as :    @xmath61 + \\left[m_{sf}(t_2)- m_{sf}(t_1)\\right ] } { ( t_2-t_1)\\dot m_{rep}}\\ , \\label{eq16}\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 is the total mass removed from the system by star - formation up to a time @xmath63 . from their models ,",

    "our results for @xmath57 will be discussed in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "other parameters from the simulations that will be useful for comparison with observations are the emission weighted temperatures of specified regions within the simulations . for all of the simulations",

    "the second is when there is a substantial build up of material in the centre of the galaxy , and the stripping is less efficient ( @xmath95 ) .",

    "we illustrate the case of the efficient stripping  mode by looking , in detail , at two representative simulations , one each for the intermediate and hot cluster models ( models 2a and 3d ) .",

    "the basic flow structure is relatively simple and the simulation quickly settles down quickly to a steady state .",
    "the main features that can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : x1 ] are as follows :    1 .   a prominent bow - shock in front of the galaxy , visible in both the density and temperature plot .",
    "there is an increase in density and temperature across the shock .",

    "3 .   there is little material accumulated at the centre of the galaxy , with a peak density of @xmath100 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : x3 ] ) .",

    "material in front of the galaxy is gravitationally accelerated , then decelerated both by the shock and by the mass - loading of replenished material , which is swept straight out of the galaxy .",
    "there are no regions where there is a region of downstream reverse flow back in the galaxy ( _ c.f._fig .",

    "the ram - pressure of the cluster is still sufficient to completely strip the galaxy . from fig .",
    "[ fig : x1 ] , for model  3d the opening angle of the bow - shock is substantially smaller .",

    "the expected observational signatures for these simulations will be discussed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "in contrast to the relatively simple dynamics for the efficient stripping  cases described above , when the mass - replenishment is sufficient or the ram - pressure low enough , complex and time - dependent flow patterns result in the vicinity of the galaxy . in these cases , material accumulates in the central region of the galaxy and dense blobs and streams of material are stripped from the galaxy .",

    "is a region of shock heated gas ( though the temperature enhancements is small given the relatively low mach number of the flow ) .",
    "however , the main difference between this simulation and model  2a shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x1 ] is the complex structure around the galaxy .",
    "there is also a dense region at the galaxy centre , with ram pressure stripping primarily occurring from the outer layers of the galaxy .",
    "complex kelvin - helmholtz type instabilities develop at the boundary where stripping is occurring .",
    "the stripping events result in long - dense filamentary structures trailing the galaxy .",

    "the density profile for model  1b is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x3 ] , and shows both shocks .",
    "the formation of this second shock is discussed in balsara _",
    "et al . _  ( 1994 ) .    in model  1b",
    "the ram - pressure stripping is sporadic , with large amounts of material being stripped over short timescales .",
    "these mass - stripping events occurs on a time scale of a few times the flow - crossing timescale , @xmath39 .    to further illustrate the complex flow dynamics for model  1b in fig .",
    "[ fig : x4 ] we show the @xmath104 component of the velocity at four different locations in the flow . in the undisturbed region",
    "ahead of the galaxy and bow - shock the gas velocity is essentially constant with time . at the galaxy centre",
    "there is sufficient build up of material to ensure that any velocities are small .",
    "there are , however , velocity excursions with both positive and negative values .",
    "the most interesting flow pattern is behind the galaxy , where the flow is complex , with periods of flow into the galaxy from the downstream region .",
    "apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : x4 ] the timescale for these events is @xmath105 years , a few times @xmath39 .",
    "this is instability behaviour noted by balsara _",
    "et al . _  ( 1994 ) .",
    "for the case of model  2c , the basic density and temperature pattern is broadly similar to that for model  1b ( fig .",
    "[ fig : x3 ] ) , in that there is a bow - shock and an enhanced density tail . however , model  2c is a less extreme case than model  1b , with the enhancement in density at the centre of the galaxy being only a factor of a few rather than several orders of magnitude .",
    "the tail is also narrower and shows less complex structure .",
    "model  2c seems to be close to the transition between the es and mr mode . at earlier times in the simulation",
    "it more closely resembles the es case , but as the simulation progressed the velocity at the centre of the galaxy dropped with progressive mass - loading .",
    "mass accumulates at the centre , making it more difficult to strip the galaxy ( and so on ) .",
    "this simulation illustrates that the distinction between the two modes of behaviour is not completely clear cut , and in particular as the environment of the galaxy changes ( as it moves closer or further from the galaxy centre ) then the dynamics will also change .",
    "so , for example , while all runs for the hot cluster in table  [ tab : x3 ] show the es mode , even with the high mass - replenishment rate , if the galaxy were at a larger radius from the cluster centre then , because the cluster ram - pressure is lower , the galaxy would be able to retain much of the replenished mass , and the dynamics would be very different ( see section  [ sec3p3 ] ) .",
    "it will also be possible for the flow pattern to undergo the opposite transition .",
    "consider a situation like model  1b , with the galaxy losing mass by discontinuous stripping events . if the incident icm ram - pressure were to increase ( either higher density or higher velocity ) , as might be expected if a galaxy was falling into the centre of a galaxy cluster , at some point the ram pressure would be sufficient to completely strip the galaxy , and the galaxy would return to the efficient continuous stripping mode .",
    "calculations by takeda _",
    "_  ( 1984 ) suggest that this transition can happen very rapidly , with the expulsion of a dense blobs of gas from the centre of the galaxy .",
    "although we have characterised the behaviour of the simulations presented here into two broad classes , the es and mr modes , in reality the distinction is not always clear cut , as illustrated by model  2c .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : x5 ] we plot the mass - retention fraction ( @xmath57 ) versus the ram - pressure stripping parameter ( @xmath66 ) as defined by gaetz _",

    "et al . _  ( 1987 ) simulations is also shown ( eqn.[eq17 ] ) .",
    "the results of our simulations are similar to those of gaetz _ et al . _  ( 1987 ) , and broadly speaking the transition from the mr mode to the es mode occurs for values of @xmath106 .    consideration of fig .",
    "[ fig : x2 ] and the simulations presented in balsara _",
    "et al . _  ( 1994 ) shows that for the mr mode material accumulates in the center of the galaxy , and ram - pressure stripping occurs from the outer edges of this denser central region .",
    "so , even while a galaxy may retain mass at its centre , beyond a certain radius it will be completely stripped . using the results of takeda",
    "_ et al . _  ( 1984 ) we can evaluate the conditions from ram - pressure stripping at different radii within the galaxy .",
    "takeda _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1984 ) found that for a spherical galaxy , the ism will be stripped from a galaxy at a projected radius @xmath107 when    @xmath108    where @xmath50 is the density of the incident icm , @xmath75 is the galaxy velocity , @xmath109 is the fraction of the stellar mass injected into the galaxy ism ( _ i.e._for @xmath110 , @xmath111 s@xmath112 ) , @xmath113 is the stellar surface density at a projected radius @xmath107 , @xmath114 the stellar velocity dispersion , and @xmath115 a constant to be empirically determined .",
    "for @xmath116 a reasonable value is @xmath117 ( _ c.f._djorgovski & davis 1987 ) .    from the stellar distribution used in the hydrodynamic model ( section  [ sec3 ] )    @xmath118    with @xmath119 the galaxy central stellar density .",
    "in these simulations a value of @xmath120 gives a reasonable representation of the depth of ram - pressure stripping in the galaxy .",
    "for example , for model  1b this corresponds to the galaxy being completely stripped beyond a radius of @xmath121 , and for model  2c for @xmath122 . as discussed by gaetz _",
    "et al . _  ( 1987 ) , this criterion implies that it is energy transfer from the incident icm that is important in the stripping process .",
    "this criterion , although having a slightly different functionality than the results from gaetz _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1987 ) , can also be used to evaluate the general behaviour of the simulations . if the equality in eqn.([eq19 ] ) is satisfied for all @xmath107 then the galaxy will be completely stripped .",
    "this defines a minimum velocity @xmath123 , so that if @xmath124 then the galaxy will be completely stripped . on the other hand ,",
    "if the equality is only satisfied for @xmath125 then the galaxy will essentially retain all of the replenished mass .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : x6 ] we show the conditions for total stripping based on the parameters used in this paper .",
    "the relationship between @xmath75 and @xmath126 is shown for the cases when @xmath127 and @xmath128 . also shown",
    "is @xmath123 as a function of @xmath126 .",
    "essentially , @xmath129 .",
    "the case when the galaxy is at a radial distance of @xmath130 from the cluster centre and @xmath23 is shown ( dashed line ) , and suggests that for a cluster with a temperature above @xmath131  the galaxy will be completely stripped ( for @xmath127 ) . for a larger mass - replenishment rate of @xmath132 the required temperature for",
    "complete stripping rises to @xmath133  ( dotted line ) . in the simulations presented here , for the @xmath134  cluster and for @xmath23",
    "the galaxy is completely ram - pressure stripped , while for @xmath132 the galaxy is stripped for the larger value of @xmath75 but not for the smaller value .",
    "moving the galaxy out to larger distances from the cluster centre increases the stripping temperature ( for large @xmath135 @xmath136 ) , and means that even galaxies in hot clusters will not necessarily be completely stripped if they are on the periphery of the cluster ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "it is worth noting that for the fornax and virgo clusters ( with @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively ) that for @xmath23 then @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively .",
    "the main point from fig .",
    "[ fig : x6 ] is that the formation of dense tails behind galaxies in clusters is most likely to occur in cool clusters , for galaxies with high mass - replenishment rates , or alternatively in the outer regions of richer clusters .",
    "we also note the following general trends from the simulations .",
    "gas directly behind the bow - shock is always hotter than ambient cluster . on the other hand , gas from ram - pressure stripping",
    "will be cooler than the ambient cluster gas ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "depending on the balance between the two sources of material the tail will be either hotter than ( or comparable to ) the cluster or cooler than the cluster if substantial stripping is occurring .",
    "this process is illustrated in the values of @xmath74 in table  [ tab : x3 ] , where for mr mode simulations @xmath142 , while for the es mode @xmath143 .",
    "one initially counter - intuitive result that follows from this is that those galaxies which retain a larger fraction of gas ( and consequently suffer less from ram - pressure stripping ) have denser tails , which in turn translates into more visible tails .",
    "correspondingly , galaxies that lose the most material into the downstream region have less dense tails .",
    "the reason is straightforward - the density ( and visibility ) of the downstream region is a sensitive function of the gas - dynamics behind the galaxy .",
    "those galaxies that have higher values of @xmath7 have more complex flow patterns behind the galaxy , with back - flow occurring and generally lower velocities in the tail .",
    "this should be contrasted with low mass - replenishment cases where the flow is simple - there is some deceleration associated with the galaxy , but the @xmath104-component of the velocity is always positive ( _ c.f._fig .",
    "[ fig : x4 ] ) .",
    "this means that material stripped from the galaxy is moved swiftly away from the galaxy and the density never builds up to significant levels .",
    "as might be expected there is a correlation between the opening angle of the bow - shock cone and the mach number . for these simulations",
    "we find that the opening angle for mach numbers of @xmath144 is around @xmath145 , decreasing to around @xmath146 for mach numbers around 2 .",
    "while in theory this would allow a method for determining the mach number of the galaxy through the icm ( and hence the actual 3-d velocity of the galaxy ) there are some complications .",
    "if there is sufficient mass - loss from the galaxy then this will alter the opening angle . in cases where the mass - replenishment is substantial",
    ", the cone opening angle is broader , which would result in an underestimate of the galaxy mach number . as discussed later",
    ", the bow - shock will usually have a faint signature and may be difficult to observe .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to investigate the expected _ observable _ properties of the theoretical simulations of the galaxy / icm interaction , with an emphasis on the x - ray waveband .",
    "as most of the current data have been taken with the  satellite ( the @xmath147  waveband ) this is the spectral region we concentrate on , though future work will look at both the  and  wavebands .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations ( figs .  [",
    "fig : x1 ] and [ fig : x2 ] ) provide values of @xmath148 and @xmath149 at all locations , and then it is straightforward to generate synthetic x - ray surface brightness maps for the simulations .",
    "the basic synthetic x - ray surface brightness maps for the four simulations in figs .",
    "[ fig : x1 ] and [ fig : x2 ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x7 ] .",
    "these images are for the @xmath147  waveband , and the background cluster emission ( appropriate for the waveband and for the cluster surface brightness - section  [ sec2p2 ] ) has been added .",
    "the cluster emission is often greater than the emission from the wake or bow - shock region and this has the effect of making the contrast between the tail or wake and background emission small .",
    "the effects of galactic absorption are not included in fig .  [ fig : x7 ] as they are likely to be of little consequence .",
    "it is necessary to carefully look at the scales in fig .",
    "[ fig : x7 ] to determine the visibility of the various structures .",
    "the images can either have a large ( _ i.e._model  1b ) or small ( the es mode simulations ) dynamic range , and the scaling has been adjusted appropriately . the important features to notice in fig .  [",
    "fig : x7 ] are as follows :    1 .   for the es mode simulations the most prominent structures are the bow - shocks , with a small deficit of emission preceding the bow shock .",
    "this is due to the lower density region caused by the gravitational acceleration of material by the galaxy .",
    "2 .   for the hotter cluster simulations ( see model  3d ) , the cluster background is very bright , and the contrast between bow - shock and background is small ( @xmath150 per cent ) .",
    "this is more apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : x8 ] , where surface brightness slices are shown for all 4 simulations .",
    "this means that interaction effects will be more likely to be seen in cooler , less luminous clusters .",
    "3 .   for the mr mode ( models  1b and 2c ) there are three main features visible in the synthetic images .",
    "first , the bow - shock , second elongated emission from the tail region and third emission from the galaxy itself .",
    "4 .   for model  1b",
    ", the galaxy is very luminous , and in order to enhance the visibility of the tail and bow - shock region we do not show the full dynamic range ( _ c.f._fig .  [",
    "fig : x8 ] ) .",
    "there is a large accumulation of material at the galaxy centre .",
    "however , this emission , essentially analogous to a cluster cooling flow , will likely be strongly absorbed in a real galaxy .",
    "5 .   for model  2c , both the bow - shock and tail are visible , but the tail is less pronounced that for model  1b .",
    "6 .   for both model  1b and model  2c the emission from the tail does stand out substantially from the cluster background . however , the contrast for the bow - shock is less .",
    "this seems to be a general characteristic - the bow - shock is always less visible than any ram - pressure stripped tail .",
    "7 .   for model  1b",
    "the synthetic image shows considerable substructure on a scale of around @xmath151 .",
    "such structures should be clearly visible with  and .    to further illustrate these points , in fig .",
    "[ fig : x8 ] surface brightness slices are shown .",
    "these slices have been generated by taking a slice of width @xmath152 cm along the @xmath104-axis .",
    "for the es cases ( models  2a and 3d as examples ) the increase in surface brightness is relatively small ( a few per cent at most ) and the surface brightness profile is relatively simple . for the mr mode case",
    "there are much greater increases in emission . taking model  1b as an example",
    ", the region associated with the galaxy is extremely bright , but the tail region also shows a substantial increase , with an excess brightness over the background of @xmath153 per cent . even the case of model  2c , which shows less in the way of enhanced emission at the position of the galaxy , has a tail",
    "for which the surface brightness is more than the @xmath154 per cent greater than the underlying cluster .    for both the mr mode simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig : x8 ] , there is substantial substructure in the surface brightness in the tail region , with regions of enhanced emission associated with blobs of gas stripped from the galaxy .",
    "the bow - shock region in the mr mode cases extends further in front of the galaxy than for the es mode cases .",
    "for our simulations we have generated hardness ratio maps , with the hardness ratio defined as @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the hard - band ( @xmath157 ) image and @xmath158 the soft - band image ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "the results in table  [ tab : x3 ] show that for the mr mode the tail region is cooler than the ambient cluster , and consequently spatial hardness variations might be expected .",
    "however , because the temperature differences are usually small and the emission from the tail region is always small compared to the background cluster emission , this means that differences in the hardness ratio are always small .",
    "in this paper we have presented some new simulations of the interaction between galaxies and the icm in clusters . for the first time we have attempted to quantify the likely observational characteristics of structures resulting from such interactions , with some promising results .",
    "galaxies which are capable of retaining some mass and have substantial tails are likely to have features that are observable",
    ". however , those that are completely ram - pressure stripped are unlikely to have observable features .",
    "the bow - shock is a more prominent feature in mr mode galaxies than in es mode galaxies ( figs .",
    "[ fig : x7 ] and [ fig : x8 ] ) .    the likely criterion for galaxies to show observable interaction effects in clusters are as follows :    1 .",
    "galaxies with younger stellar populations ( and hence more substantial mass - loss ) are more likely to show interaction effects at x - ray energies .",
    "2 .   galaxies in cooler clusters or group will be more likely to have observable stripped tails .",
    "galaxies in rich clusters will be more likely to be completely stripped .",
    "galaxies in lower surface brightness clusters - in richer , brighter clusters the contrast between tail and background emission is smaller .",
    "galaxies at the periphery of rich clusters .",
    "massive gas - rich galaxies infalling into rich clusters should show tails .",
    "this means that bluer galaxies in nearby cooler clusters are the most likely place to look for such interaction effects . for rich clusters , such as coma , most galaxies are likely to be completely stripped , except those at the periphery of the cluster , which may be in an environment where they can retain some mass .",
    "these simulations have also shown that while tails may be a feature of galaxies in clusters of all levels of richness the effects are more likely to be seen in the cooler clusters .",
    "the potential rewards of being able to exploit the galaxy / icm interactions are great ( merrifield 1998 ) , however these simulations show the dynamics are complicated and the level of emission from the tail ( for instance ) will depend on parameters that may be difficult to determine ( such as @xmath7 ) .",
    "consequently , it may take a substantial effort at modelling individual galaxies to fully determine the true velocity vector for that galaxy .",
    "the other , simple approach , to merely use the galaxies direction of motion on the plane of the sky ( as revealed by a linear trailing structure ) , may also be able to yield interesting results .",
    "the assumptions made here have been chosen to be simple and to be the most favourable .",
    "for example , we have assumed the galaxies to be spherical .",
    "in reality , the galaxies will be elliptical and the gas flow out of the galaxy will depend on the orientation of the galaxy with respect to its velocity vector through the icm .",
    "for instance , it might be anticipated that mass might be lost more easily from the galaxy through the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "we have also assumed that we are viewing the galaxy in the plane of the sky .",
    "if the galaxy is moving at a different angle then projection effects will play a role , foreshortening the tail and potentially making identification of galaxy / icm features difficult .",
    "the effect of both of these assumptions will have to be explored with more sophisticated simulations .",
    "while certain orientations of an elliptical galaxy can be dealt with by 2-d simulations , the more general case of random galaxy orientation will require 3-d simulations    for several of the suspected examples of galaxy / icm interaction ( section  [ sec1 ] ) all that can be discerned about the dynamic structures associated with the galaxy motion is an extension of the x - ray contours away from the cluster centre ( usually interpreted as due to infall of the galaxy towards the cluster centre ) .",
    "examples of this are ngc4839 in the coma cluster ( dow & white 1995 ) and ngc1404 ( jones _ et al . _",
    "it is notable that ngc4839 is located towards the edge of the coma cluster , where we might expect interactions effects to be more visible .    in the case of m86 ,",
    "in addition to an emission peak at the galaxy centre , there is also a second peak associated with the tail . these simulations and those of balsara _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1994 ) suggest that stripping will often occur in discrete events , with blobs of material being removed",
    ". these blobs will result in enhancements in the tail region , and this is what may be occurring in m86 .",
    "ngc4472 shows very complex emission , with some evidence of a bow - shock as well as a tail .",
    "this galaxy will clearly require more detailed work on it .",
    "irwin & sarazin ( 1996 ) suggest that some of the features may be related to the elliptical nature of the galaxy and its orientation with respect to its motion .",
    "this idea will clearly have to be tested with further simulations allowing for non - spherical galaxies .    in summary , we have new presented calculations of the galaxy / icm interaction in clusters , with particular emphasis on investigating the likely observable consequences of such interactions . from these simulations",
    "it is clear that many galaxies should show observable effects of the galaxy / icm interaction , the most prominent feature being linear tails , resulting from ram - pressure stripping .",
    "we have performed simulations for a wide range of cluster parameters , with the goal of trying to define the best parameter space to investigate . while massive galaxies , with young stellar populations , in cool nearby clusters such as virgo or fornax offer the best possibilities , the periphery of richer clusters also offers interesting possibilities .",
    "an important result is that it is not galaxies that are completely ram - pressure stripped that have the brightest tails , but rather those which are able to retain a substantial fraction ( but not all ) of the replenished material .",
    "in this situation , stripping occurs in discrete events and results in high density tails .",
    "bow - shocks should also be visible in some galaxies , particularly in upcoming  and  observations of nearby candidates .",
