    "the pairing properties of nuclear systems - finite nuclei and the bulk nuclear matter - play an important role in the physical manifestations of these systems . in most cases of interest",
    "the pairing occurs at finite isospin asymmetry .",
    "for example , charge neutral bulk nuclear matter with an admixture of leptons in @xmath0 equilibrium implies proton abundancies at about @xmath1 in supernova matter and @xmath2 in neutron star matter .",
    "the dominant partial - wave channel for the pairing depends on the density , temperature , and the isospin asymmetry in general . for large enough asymmetries",
    "the matter is paired in the isospin triplet channels - the @xmath3 channel at low densities @xcite and @xmath4-@xmath5 or @xmath6 channels at high densities@xcite . for weakly asymmetric systems",
    "the isospin singlet attractive @xmath7-@xmath8 and @xmath9 channels@xcite dominate the pairing interaction at low and high densities , respectively .",
    "in bulk nuclear matter of compact stars the asymmetries are most likely too large to support isospin singlet pairing .",
    "however the dilute nuclear matter in supernovas and the low - density tails of the exotic nuclei can support @xmath7-@xmath8-channel pairing , since in general the isospin asymmetry is less effective in destroying the pair correlations in dilute matter@xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the suppression of the bcs pairing of the kind found in asymmetric nuclear matter was initially studied in metallic superconductors in a spin - polarizing magnetic field . since a homogenous magnetic field",
    "is screened beyond the london penetration depth in the bulk of a superconductor , in real materials the electron spin polarization is induced by low - density paramagnetic impurities , which interact with an electron by spin nonconserving forces .",
    "the effect of collision induced polarization is commonly modeled by an average polarizing field which implies an asymmetry in the populations of spin - up and -down quasiparticles .",
    "the resulting electron pauli paramagnetism suppresses the @xmath10-wave pairing when the fermi surfaces of the electrons with spin - up and -down are apart on a scale of the order of the energy gap in the quasiparticle spectrum",
    ". a close analogy to the ordinary superconductors can be seen in the effect of the large @xmath11 fields in the neutron stars on the @xmath10-wave pairing of neutrons .",
    "our general discussion below also applies to the pairing in spin - polarized neutron matter in the @xmath3 channel , although the numerical computations are carried out for the isoscalar pairing in asymmetric matter .",
    "the understanding of the isospin singlet pairing as a function of the isospin asymmetry requires an extension of the standard bcs theory to describe phases with spontaneously broken space symmetries .",
    "larkin and ovchinnikov@xcite and fulde - ferrell@xcite ( loff ) argued , in the context of metallic superconductors , that a transition from the bcs paired to the normal state occurs via a phase where the cooper pairs carry a finite total momentum .",
    "the isospin polarization in nuclear matter with pairing in the @xmath7-@xmath8 channel leads to a nuclear loff phase for a range of isospin asymmetries@xcite . unlike the metallic superconductors where the ratio of the pairing gap to the average chemical potential is of the order 10@xmath12 , the nuclear loff phase emerges in the strong coupling regime , where this ratio is of the order 0.1 .",
    "the spatially periodic structure of the nuclear loff phase corresponding to oscillations of the condensate wave function are on the scales of the order of several fm .",
    "note that , independent of the detailed structure of the lattice , the loff phase breaks _ both _ the translational and rotational invariance of the original bcs state .",
    "the formation of the loff phase is a robust feature of the fermionic systems with broken time - reversal symmetry and has been studied in detail in the flavor asymmetric high - density qcd ( crystalline color superconductivity ) @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the condensate from the bcs to paired states with broken space symmetries , as the isospin asymmetry is increased , can take a different path if we give up the assumption that the intrinsically homogeneous matter features spherical fermi surfaces@xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for quadrupole deformed fermi surfaces ( dfs ) the bcs condensate evolves to a state with spontaneously broken rotational symmetry [ in group theory terms the @xmath13 symmetry breaks down to @xmath14 .",
    "such a state is still axially symmetric and , unlike the loff phase , preserves the translational symmetry .",
    "we shall refer to the superconducting state with deformed fermi surfaces as the dfs phase with the understanding that the expansion describing the deformation of fermi surfaces is truncated at quadrupole order ( the higher order terms in the multiple expansion have not been studied so far ) .",
    "why do the phases with broken space symmetries dominate the bcs state ?",
    "the bcs quasiparticle spectrum ( for homogeneous systems ) is isotropic ; when the polarizing field drives apart the fermi surfaces of fermions with spin / isospin up and down the phase space overlap is lost , hence the pairing is suppressed .",
    "the finite momentum of the cooper pairs of the loff phase implies an anisotropic quasiparticle spectrum ; the magnitude of the anisotropy is controlled by the value of the net momentum of the pairs which is treated as a parameter .",
    "this new degree of freedom , which can be viewed as an additional variational parameter for the minimization of the ground state of the system , ( partially ) overcomes the phase - space loss caused by the departure of the fermi surfaces from the perfectly overlapping configuration . in effect",
    "the gain in the pairing energy through increase of the pairing field dominates the increase of the kinetic energy . to motivate the dfs phase , note that formally the loff spectrum can be viewed as a dipole ( @xmath15 ) perturbation of the spherically symmetrical bcs spectrum , where @xmath16 are the legendre polynomials , and @xmath17 is the cosine of the angle between the particle momentum and the total momentum of the cooper pair .",
    "the dfs phase assumes an expansion of the quasiparticle spectrum up to the next - to - leading order , quadrupole ( @xmath18 ) deformation ; it also assumed that the total momentum of the cooper pairs is zero , i.e. , there are quadrupole deformations only . although the perturbations from the spherical symmetry cost kinetic energy , they are compensated by the gain in the potential energy . for a range of asymmetries the dfs phase becomes the ground state of the paired system@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is a combined treatment of the loff and the dfs phases in bulk isospin asymmetric nuclear matter within the same model as that in refs .",
    "the model assumes a pairing force given by a phase - shift equivalent ( i.e. , realistic ) interaction and nonrenormalized quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "the effect of the mean field in the brueckner - hartree - fock approximation is to reduce the range of isospin asymmetries where the pairing exists@xcite .",
    "we shall follow the strategy of disentangling the effects of the mean field from the pairing since already at the level of approximations of refs .",
    "@xcite the loff and dfs phases show a complicated behavior .",
    "the renormalization of the quasiparticle spectrum for the pairing interaction is a problem of its own which has not been solved to date .",
    "issues such as the consistency between the vertex and propagator renormalization and fulfillment of the spectral sum rules , etc . need further attention .    in section 2",
    "we derive the bcs equations , which include the effects of the finite momentum of the cooper pairs and fermi surface deformations , within the finite - temperature real - time green s functions formalism .",
    "the numerical solutions of these equations are presented in section 3 , where we discuss the phase diagram of the combined loff and dfs phases and their properties at finite temperatures .",
    "section 4 contains a summary of the results and an outlook .",

    "we choose to formulate the finite - temperature pairing theory in terms of nonequilibrium real - time green s functions .",

    "the hierarchy at a given level can be decoupled ( formally ) by introducing the self - energy matrix : [ dyson2 ] g_(0)^-1(x_1)g(x_1,x_2 ) = _ z(x_1-x_2 ) + ( x_1,x_3 ) ( x_3,x_2 ) , which is defined as [ sigma1 ] ( x_1,x_2 ) = - v(x_1,x_6;x_5,x_4)(x_5,x_4,x_7,x_6^+ ) g^-1(x_7,x_2 ) .",

    "the position of the true minimum of the free energy coincides with the maximum in the pairing gap in the positive @xmath60 regime .      when the system is in an isospin asymmetric state the effect of the temperature on the pairing gap and related characteristics of the superconducting state is twofold : first , at high temperatures the pairing is suppressed due to the thermal excitation of the quasiparticle states , in analogy to the classical bcs superconductors ; second , at low temperatures the    pairing is enhanced by the temperature , since the thermal excitation of the quasiparticle states at different fermi surfaces reduces the blocking effect and increases the phase - space overlap .",

    "the reentrace effect for @xmath125 is seen for both signs of @xmath60 ; the lower critical deformation corresponds to the onset of the pairing due to the restoration of the phase - space coherence via the deformation of the spherical fermi surface into quasiellipsoidal form .",

    "the @xmath126 duality is seen in the case where deformation vanishes ( asymmetric bcs state ) .",
    "the lower critical temperature corresponds to the thermal stimulation of the pair correlations due to the smearing of the fermi surfaces , while the upper critical temperature corresponds to the ordinary thermal suppression of the pairing in the bcs - normal state transition .",

    "6 . there are two minima corresponding to the oblate or prolate deformations of the fermi surfaces of neutrons / protons .",
    "the shape of @xmath107 is controlled by the interplay between the pairing potential energy and the kinetic energy ; the contribution from the entropy difference is numerically negligible .",
    "the minima correspond to large deformations of the order 0.5 which optimize the gain in the potential energy over the loss in the kinetic energy due to the deformation ; the true minimum occurs for positive @xmath60 at zero - temperature .",
    "while temperature stimulated pairing correlations are seen for small deviations from the bcs state , this effect is not essential , since the minimum of the @xmath107 surface occurs at large @xmath60 .",
    "the dfs phase is most stable in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "the fermionic condensation in nuclear matter under isospin asymmetry leads to superconducting states which spontaneously break the space symmetries .",
    "we studied two realizations of such condensates - the loff phase , where the cooper pairs carry finite momentum , and the dfs phase where the fermi surfaces of the paired nucleons are deformed , to the lowest order into ellipsoidal form .",
    "a unifying feature of these phases is the deformation of the spectrum of the quasiparticle excitations at the leading ( loff ) and next - to - leading ( dfs ) order in the expansion in legendre polynomials with respect to the angle between the particle momenta and the axis of symmetry breaking .",
    "when these deformations are treated simultaneously , we find that the pure dfs phase has lower energy than the loff phase .",
    "the combination of these phases still lower the energy of the normal system and can exists in a metastable state .",
    "in particular , the pure loff state could be realized in the case where the unpaired state features some intrinsic spatial asymmetries ( e.g. , due to the lattice in the metallic superconductors ) . of course",
    ", the axis of the symmetry breaking for the loff and dfs phases need not be the same and , more generally , the patterns of symmetry breaking could be more complicated than those studied here ( e.g. , higher order multipole deformations of the fermi surfaces ) .",
    "the phase diagrams of the loff and dfs phases in the temperature / deformation plane show a number of unusual features : ( i ) two critical temperatures for the onset of the superconducting state ( the reentrace phenomenon ) .",
    "the upper critical temperature is the analog of the bcs temperature for the superconducting - normal phase transition .",
    "the lower critical temperature is specific to asymmetric systems and results from the thermally stimulated phase - space overlap between the pairing states .",
    "( ii ) there exists duality between the temperature effects and the finite - momentum or deformation effects .",
    "for example , at low temperatures the loff phase is characterized by two critical momenta of the cooper pairs at which the superconducting phase sets in .",
    "( iii ) the free energy of the combined loff and dfs phases shows local minima corresponding to negative and positive relative deformations at zero momentum of the pairs .",
    "the lowest energy corresponds to a phase with oblate neutron and prolate proton fermi surfaces ( @xmath60 is positive ) .",
    "the realization of the @xmath78 pairing in bulk nuclear matter depends on a number of factors : ( i ) the ratio of the pairing gap to the average chemical potential , which controls the density - temperature - dependent critical asymmetries at which the pairing vanishes ; this ratio depends sensitively on the quasiparticle renormalization effects which need further study in this context .",
    "( ii ) a second factor involves the asymmetries implied by the @xmath0 equilibrium of the matter with leptons in the stellar matter ; while the asymmetries derived for the normal state may serve as order of magnitude estimates , the loff and dfs phases under @xmath0 equilibrium might require asymmetries largely different from those deduced for the unpaired system .",
    "( iii ) the matter could prefer a state where the superconducting and normal phases coexist in a mixed phase , with superconducting `` islands '' immersed in the unpaired matter ; the analogy to the type - i superconductors in the magnetic fields is a useful counterpart of this type of ordering .",
    "( iv ) the extreme low - density asymmetric nuclear matter can support pairing in the @xmath78 channel at much larger asymmetries than the matter , say , at the nuclear saturation density ; however , in this strong coupling regime one deals with a bose - einstein condensate of deuterons coexisting with a low - density neutron gas@xcite and one needs an understanding of the crossover from the loff and dfs phases to their bose - einstein condensed counterparts .",
    "we now briefly comment on possible realization of the phases with broken space symmetries in other nuclear systems .",
    "the neutron - proton pairing in finite nuclei@xcite is an obvious candidate .",
    "the odd - number projected bcs equations contain the decoherence effects in the gap equation introduced by the extra odd particle .",
    "the resulting blocking effect is quite analogous to the phase decoherence due to the imposed neutron - proton asymmetry in the bulk nuclear matter .",
    "the problem of realization of the loff phase is facilitated by the fact that the pairing instability occurs for total momenta @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the radius of the nucleus .",
    "therefore , for already medium size nuclei the influence of the surface on the condensation energy should not be large and the solutions found for the interior of the nucleus should go over to those corresponding to infinite systems .",
    "the translational symmetry is not broken by the dfs phase , therefore the finite size effects ( while being generally of the same order of magnitude as for the loff phase ) would affect the structure of the condensate to the same extent as those for the case of the pairing with undeformed fermi surfaces .    quite generally , the phases with broken space symmetries arise in the physical situations where the time - reversal symmetry between the paired fermion states is broken .",
    "this is the case , for example , in finite nuclei under rotation .",
    "the @xmath3 pairing among neutrons and/or protons in such nuclei can support the loff or dfs like states .",
    "similarly , the magnetic field breaks the time - reversal invariance due to the pauli paramagnetism of neutrons and protons . the loff and dfs phases can arise for the case of the @xmath3 pairing in strong magnetic fields , for example , in neutron star crusts .",
    "these phases will emerge when the interaction energy of a neutron spin with the magnetic field @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the anomalous magnetic moment of a neutron , is of the order of the pairing gap in the zero field limit .",
    "this condition is satisfied for the field strength of the order @xmath135-@xmath136 g ( depending on the value of the pairing gap ) which could occur in the highly magnetized subpopulation of neutron stars ( magnetars ) .",
    "as is well know , the breaking of the continuous symmetries in the infinite systems leads to collective excitations with vanishing minimal frequency ( goldstone s theorem ) .",
    "the loff phase breaks the translational and rotational symmetries ; the existence of the preferred direction in the dfs phase breaks the rotational symmetry of the system .",
    "the breaking of continuous symmetries in the ground of these phases , therefore , implies new collective bosonic modes in asymmetric nuclear matter . in finite systems",
    "the goldstone theorem implies collective modes which tend to zero as a certain power of the radius of the system .",
    "the observation of the goldstone modes associated with the loff and/or dfs phases could provide information on the true ground state structure of the condensate under laboratory conditions , for example , in finite nuclei .",
