    "numerous studies have shown a strong correlation between supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass and host galaxy mass over broad mass ranges , implying that there is a close evolutionary relationship between them @xcite .",
    "luminous quasars at high redshifts , which represent the most massive smbhs , are experiencing vigorous accretion of a significant portion of the final smbh mass .",
    "this accretion activity is believed to be triggered by global processes ( galaxy mergers , interactions or perhaps secular evolution ) that also trigger major episodes of star formation in the massive host galaxies , which are also rapidly being assembled at high redshifts .",
    "therefore , the processes of smbh formation and growth resulting in the quasar phenomenon are directly linked to the birth of massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the relationship between quasars and galaxy formation is not well understood .",
    "it is widely believed that strong interactions between gas rich galaxies can result in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , defined by l@xmath1110@xmath12 , which have star formation rates ( sfrs ) of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a fraction of ulirgs have been found to contain dust - enshrouded quasars @xcite .",
    "there is evidence at both low and high redshift that these embedded quasars are precursors to optically luminous quasars .",
    "for example , @xcite find that low redshift quasars with ir luminosities in the ulirg range fall between optically selected pg quasars and ulirgs ( starbursts ) for a variety of mid - ir spectroscopic indicators of starburst and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) contributions including : polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) luminosities , fine structure emission line strengths , silicate absorption strengths , spectral slope and mid - ir colour indices .",
    "these findings suggest that ir luminous quasars could represent an intermediate stage between a dominant starburst and a dominant agn phase .",
    "quasars with high sfrs therefore may be at an intermediate stage between an embedded quasar in a star forming galaxy and a visible quasar in a galaxy where most star formation has ceased ( see also @xcite ) . at low redshifts ,",
    "numerous star formation indicators in quasar host galaxies are seen , e.g. high ir luminosities , pah emission , strong ( sub)-mm emission and strong co emission @xcite . at high redshifts ( z  @xmath9  2 - 6 )",
    ", observations at sub - mm and mm wavelengths ( rest - frame far - infrared ( fir ) to sub - mm , depending on wavelength and redshift range ) of optically luminous quasars suggest that up to 30% of quasars also fall within the ulirg range , similar to the ir quasars studied by @xcite @xcite .",
    "@xcite compare dynamical , gas and smbh masses of ten z  @xmath14   sub - mm detected quasars and z  @xmath14   sub - mm galaxies ( smgs ) , which are high redshift counterparts to ulirgs , though less extreme with more evenly distributed star formation instead of a localised starburst @xcite .",
    "they find that the fainter half of their quasar sample could likely be ` transition objects ' between smgs and luminous quasars , based on their smg - like surface densities and their proximity to the local m@xmath15/m@xmath16 relation , since luminous quasars tend to lie above this relation and typical smgs tend to lie below .",
    "the highest redshift sub - mm - selected source currently known has also been observed to posses similar stellar and gas masses to this z  @xmath14   sample of transition objects , as well as a small agn contribution @xcite .",
    "these quasars eventually may produce enough energy from accretion to effectively blow out the surrounding gas , halting star formation and clearing the view to an optically bright quasar before halting their own growth @xcite .",
    "this regulation of star formation by the accreting smbh could naturally produce the observed black hole - galaxy mass correlation , and different stages of the process should present different sfrs , with initially high sfrs declining as the agn becomes more dominant , culminating in a phase of strong smbh accretion and little or no ongoing star formation @xcite .",
    "fir luminosities can be used to determine the star formation rates in quasar host galaxies .",
    "the fir emission is due to dust heated either by star formation or quasar emission ( see @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "@xcite find evidence that fir emission in quasar host galaxies at all redshifts is caused by dust heated by star formation and not the quasar .",
    "the strength of pah emission , which is found almost exclusively in star forming regions , tightly corresponds to the strength of fir emission in the same hosts @xcite .",
    "@xcite measure fir emission from six high redshift quasars and derive fir to radio spectral indexes consistent with local star forming galaxies without agn .",
    "the fir emission is seemingly uncontaminated by hotter dust potentially heated by the agn .",
    "these results along with others ( see for example , @xcite ) further substantiate the claim that the fir luminosity in quasars is dominated by star formation and not by the agn .",
    "fir luminosity traces ongoing star formation , but past star formation also can be observed indirectly by measuring chemical abundances .",
    "several studies have found that high - redshift quasars typically have metallicities greater than or equal to solar metallicity in the broad emission line region ( blr ) , which requires significant previous star formation in the host @xcite .",
    "these blr studies rely on emission line ratios such as /   and + /   that are sensitive to the selective enrichment of nitrogen as a secondary element and/or to the decreasing temperatures and increasing metal - line saturations that occur in metal - rich gas .",
    "the main result for typically solar or higher metallicities near quasars has been corroborated by independent studies of the narrow emission lines @xcite and narrow absorption lines @xcite in quasar spectra .",
    "the metal - rich blr result is true even for the highest redshifts studied , e.g. @xcite , with redshifts out to z  =  6.4 .",
    "there is no known change in metallicity with redshift ( see @xcite and references above ) .",
    "simple chemical evolution models for quasars and elliptical galaxies find that galactic centres tend to be more metal - rich than their halos , and a centralised starburst can enrich the galactic centre to supersolar abundances in a short time ( @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "these models , combined with the consistently super - solar gas abundances observed in quasar environments , imply that quasars tend to emerge after or near the end of ( potentially ) short centralised star formation epochs .",
    "if the quasar phase emerges when star formation is on the decline , less advanced environments might have higher sfrs and lower abundances @xcite .",
    "the absorption lines in quasar spectra provide additional information about outflows that might be related to the blowout of gas from the host galaxies , and perhaps , about the gaseous remnants of recent galaxy mergers .",
    "these absorption lines may be more common in quasars with higher sfrs if mergers and interactions trigger the star formation as in ulirgs @xcite .",
    "quasar ` associated '   absorption lines ( aals ) , near the emission redshifts with velocity widths less than 500  and broad absorption lines ( bals ) , with velocity widths greater than a few thousand , are examples of these potential merger , interaction and outflow signatures .",
    "in systems with recent mergers , remnants from the interaction may manifest as a greater incidence of low - velocity ( @xmath18  ) aals .",
    "about 25% of bright quasars contain aals with rest equivalent widths ( rews ) of @xmath190.3   , and around 10% of quasars have bals @xcite",
    ". a higher incidence of aals or bals may occur in the quasars with higher sfrs if these quasars have more recently experienced an interaction and/or there is a progression in quasar outflow characteristics with time .    in this paper , we present an exploratory observational study examining whether sfr in the host galaxies correlates with metallicity in the near - quasar environment .",
    "we measure metallicity in the quasar blr from the rest frame ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum and estimate galactic sfrs from the fir luminosities .",

    "our analysis is limited to the spectral region between ly@xmath36  1216     and  1550   .",

    "possible broadening in   is predicted if the   emission forms at a larger distance from the quasar than the   emission . @xcite and @xcite find that   forms twice as close to the quasar as , so if the line widths are controlled by virial motions ,   could be up to @xmath40 times broader than .",
    "ly@xmath36 , on the other hand , forms at about the same distance from the quasar as   and should be no broader ( and probably narrower ) than   @xcite .",
    "therefore , the   profiles we adopt , which have the same fwhm s as , may be narrower than the actual   fwhm s , while the ly@xmath36   fwhm could be slightly broader .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties in the   line strengths due to uncertainty in the continuum placement by repeating the line fits with different reasonable continuum heights .",

    "the +   emission line is weaker than the   and   emission lines in the composite spectra , however it also is isolated from other emission .",

    "we confirm the accuracy of the equivalent width measurements by comparing the previously measured fluxes from gaussian fits to   to the fluxes from   equivalent widths , and find compatible results .",
    "we measure +   and   equivalent widths to calculate the + /   line flux ratios listed in table  [ tab : abs ] . to estimate uncertainties in the +   line strengths , we vary the equivalent width measurements by using a range of continuum heights and wavelength cutoffs for the edge of the emission lines .",
    "the overall uncertainties in the +   line strengths are less than a factor of 1.2 , so that the measurement errors in the + /   ratios are also less than a factor of 1.2 .",
    "we convert the /   flux ratios into metallicities using the theoretical relationship in which nitrogen abundance increases relative to carbon as metallicity increases because of secondary enrichment ( cno nucleosynthesis ) processes , and determine the average metallicity for each l@xmath35 composite @xcite .",
    "the correlation is characterised by @xcite with recent updates to the solar abundance ratios by @xcite .",
    "we find supersolar metallicities for all three composite spectra , as listed in column 6 of table  [ tab : abs ] .",
    "similar characterisations for the + /   flux ratio - metallicity correlation are performed by @xcite , using the older solar abundances also used by @xcite .",
    "we apply the latest corrections for the solar abundance ratios for this characterisation and determine that the metallicities are also supersolar according to this ratio , as shown in column 8 of table  [ tab : abs ] .",
    "there is no significant trend among the three composites in the line ratios , based both on our measurements of these ratios and on a visual inspection of the stacked composites in figure  [ fig : comp ] , and correspondingly there is no significant trend in metallicity .",
    "the average metallicities across the three composites are z@xmath99.5  z@xmath5 for the /   ratio and 4.2  z@xmath5 for the + /   ratio .",
    "we note that the metallicities inferred from the two line ratios can differ by as much as a factor of @xmath92 in the same spectrum .",
    "this is typical of the dispersion found between different line ratios in other studies , and it might be a good indication of the theoretical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "we compare our metallicities to the metallicities in the l@xmath41 range 10@xmath42 to 10@xmath43  erg s@xmath7 sampled by a large emission line study by @xcite , who find metallicities of z  @xmath93 - 6  z@xmath5 , broadly consistent with the metallicities found in this sample .",
    "we also note that the results based on /(and /he  ii ) tend to be higher than other line ratios , and thus our best guess at the metallicity in the current sample overall would be near the lower end of the range 49 z@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the _ relative _ metallicities between the three composites , which smooth over object - to - object scatter , are robust for differences greater than a factor of 2 - 3 , based on the uncertainties in the line ratio measurements plus the theoretical uncertainties , and therefore useful for spotting strong metallicity trends among the different l@xmath35 bins .",
    "we inspect each sdss spectrum used to make the composites and count the number of   aals with rew  @xmath44     per spectrum .",
    "we find that 17/34 quasars have at least one aal and 6/34 have absorption too broad to be classified as an aal , yet too narrow to be classified as a bal , with widths more than twice the thermal width and velocity dispersion expected for unrelated gas in the line of sight , which is indicative of gas forming in an outflow @xcite .",
    "these statistics are broadly consistent with previous work , given the small numbers involved in this study @xcite .",
    "aals and outflow lines appear in each of the three l@xmath35 bins , with no significant differences in their occurrence fractions among the bins that would indicate a trend with l@xmath35 , particularly given the small number of objects in each bin .",
    "the average line flux ratios /  @xmath45 and + /  @xmath46   across the three composites , as shown in columns 5 and 7 of table  [ tab : abs ] , correspond to average metallicities of z  @xmath9  9.5 and 4.2  z@xmath5 respectively , shown in columns 6 and 8 of table  [ tab : abs ] .",
    "there is no significant trend in metallicity with l@xmath35 in this sample .",
    "we note that the fir bright bin has the most luminous average l@xmath41 , while the fir faint and intermediate bins have roughly equal , and less luminous average l@xmath41 .",
    "this difference in l@xmath41 could appear in the relative metallicities among the bins because more luminous quasars tend to be more metal - rich than less luminous quasars @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of a corresponding gradient in the metallicity is not surprising given the relatively high average of the total l@xmath41 , the range in average l@xmath41 among the composites of less than 0.4  dex ( table  [ tab : abs ] ) , which corresponds to a range in metallicity of no more than 0.2  dex in @xcite , and the sensitivity of the data to trends in metallicity greater than @xmath90.3  dex between the three l@xmath35 bins .",
    "the fact that the data show no significant metallicity evolution with changing sfr ( l@xmath35 ) could be due to the small sample sizes being affected by object - to - object scatter or by the small dynamic range in l@xmath35 , with values that are all within the luminosity / sfr range of powerful ulirgs .",
    "absorption features such as aals and bals and reddened continua may be more numerous among quasar environments that have undergone a recent merger or are participating in the blowout of gas that is revealing the visible quasar @xcite .",
    "although these are optically selected quasars chosen to be bright in the rest - frame uv and strongly reddened sources would be excluded , there could still be a more subtle trend in sub - samples by l@xmath35 .",
    "we do not find a trend in the number of aals per quasar or in the continuum slope per l@xmath35 bin .",
    "each bin appears to have roughly the same percentage of quasars with aals .",
    "the absence of a trend could be due simply to the small numbers in our sample . or ,",
    "if the consistency across bins is real , it could indicate that there is no progression in quasar outflow characteristics with changing sfrs .",
    "a larger sample size is needed to resolve this question .",
    "the overall conclusion from this and other studies is that quasars appear to be metal - rich at all redshifts , with only small variations due to smbh mass and luminosity dependencies @xcite .",
    "the consistently high metallicities suggest that the star formation producing these fir - bright quasars is not the star formation that determines the metallicity of the blr . instead",
    ", the blr gas must have been enriched prior to these fir - producing star formation episodes , possibly shortly after a merger or some other star formation trigger when the starburst first began .",
    "there are no significant differences among the l@xmath35 bins in the outflow fraction or in the amount of debris leftover from mergers in the form of absorption , which might correlate with l@xmath35 if this is indeed an evolutionary sequence .",
    "this scenario is consistent with models of galaxy and quasar evolution , which predict a lack of metallicity evolution .",
    "the models also find that quasar activity , though caused by a disruption of some sort , is significantly delayed after the disruption event and most of the star formation and enrichment in the host is complete even as the quasar phase first begins to emerge @xcite .",
    "the fir - bright quasars may be in some sense less mature than the fir - faint quasars , however , this is not manifest in significant metallicity evolution over the timescales probed by this sample , which are shorter than a quasar lifetime",
    ".    the reality of quasar - host galaxy formation could also be more complicated than any simple monotonic sequence in which high sfrs correlate cleanly with lower metallicities and an earlier stage of evolution .",
    "@xcite suggest a ` softer ' ulirg - quasar evolution paradigm with more scatter in the path of an individual galaxy s evolution from ulirg to quasar .",
    "they measure neon abundances of z@xmath92.9  z@xmath10 in the nuclear regions of ulirgs .",
    "if these high metallicities are ubiquitous in ulirgs , we will never observe metal - poor quasars , regardless of their stage of evolution .",
    "other plausible scenarios suggest that agn and star formation activity in galaxies may be episodic in nature @xcite .",
    "thus , as a quasar emerges at the tail end of a star - forming phase , there is no guarantee that its blr metallicity is linked to this recent and/or ongoing star formation phase , because several previous episodes of star formation and agn activity could already have occurred and enriched the blr gas to supersolar values .",
    "an alternative interpretation is provided by the works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they postulate a scenario where a star - forming galaxy could quickly reach an equilibrium metallicity early in its formation history .",
    "higher mass galaxies would have higher abundances , but for a given galaxy , the abundance would not change significantly after an initial balance of in - flowing metal - poor and out - flowing metal - rich gas was reached .",
    "the lack of blr metallicity evolution with star formation rate found in this study is consistent with these objects having previously reached an equilibrium metallicity , unaffected by the observed ongoing star formation .",
    "we create composite rest - frame uv spectra for a sample of 34 quasars observed in the fir and measure /   and + /   flux ratios .",
    "we convert these flux ratios into a metallicity for each of three l@xmath35 bins , which we interpret as sfr bins .",
    "we find that all three bins have supersolar metallicities of the order 4 to 9 times solar , and find no metallicity trend with l@xmath35 .",
    "we investigate the amount of outflowing gas , as manifest by both aals and somewhat broader absorption lines , in each l@xmath35 bin and find no difference in number between the l@xmath35 bins , neither do we find a change in continuum slope with changing l@xmath35 , as would be consistent with more dusty star formation in hosts with higher sfrs .",
    "together , these results suggest that the ongoing star formation in the host is not responsible for the metal enrichment of the blr gas . instead",

    "<S> the measured  @xmath81240/  @xmath81550 and  @xmath81397 +  @xmath81402/  @xmath81550 emission line ratios indicate super - solar blr metallicities in all three composites , with no evidence for a trend with the star formation rate . </S>",

    "<S> , young quasars , those more closely associated with a recent merger or a blowout of gas and dust , may exhibit tracers of these events , such as redder continuum slopes and higher incidence of narrow absorption lines . with the caveat of small sample sizes , we find no relation between l@xmath1 and the reddening or the incidence of absorption lines .    </S>",
