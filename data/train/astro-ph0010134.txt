    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and nuclear starbursts may severely disrupt the gas phase of galaxies through deposition of a large amount of mechanical energy in the centers of galaxies . as a result ,",
    "a large - scale galactic wind ( `` superwind '' ) that encompasses much of the central regions of these galaxies may be created ( e.g. , chevalier & clegg 1985 ; schiano 1985 ; tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 ; tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; maclow & mccray 1988 ; maclow , mccray , & norman 1989 ) . depending upon the extent of the halo and its density and upon the wind s mechanical luminosity and duration , the wind may ultimately blow out through the halo and into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the effects of these superwinds may be far - reaching .",
    "bregman ( 1978 ) has suggested that the hubble sequence can be understood in terms of a galaxy s greater ability to sustain winds with increasing bulge - to - disk ratio .",
    "superwinds may affect the thermal and chemical evolution of galaxies by depositing large quantities of hot , metal - enriched material on the outskirts of galaxies .",
    "this widespread circulation of matter and energy between the disks and halos of galaxies may be responsible for the metallicity - radius relation within galaxies and the mass - metallicity relation between galaxies ( e.g. , larson & dinerstein 1975 ; vader 1986 ; franx & illingworth 1990 ; carollo & danziger 1994 ; zaritsky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 ; jablonka , martin , & arimoto 1996 ; jrgensen , franx , & kjaergaard 1996 ; pahre , djorgovski , & de carvalho 1998 ; trager et al .",
    "superwinds also offer a natural way to create a cosmically evolving population of large , metal - enriched , kinematically - complex gaseous halos , in many ways resembling the sharp metal lines and lyman - limit systems observed in quasar spectra .",
    "strong evidence for spatially - resolved starburst - driven winds now exits in several galaxies ( e.g. , bland & tully 1988 ; heckman et al .",
    "1990 ; lehnert & heckman 1996 ; marlowe et al . 1995 ; meurer et al . 1992 ; veilleux et al .",

    "; veilleux , tully , & bland - hawthorn 1993 ; colbert et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b , 1998 ) although here the exact mechanism responsible for the outflow is sometimes uncertain .",
    "possible mechanisms include : ( 1 ) thermal wind from a circumnuclear starburst ( e.g. , baum et al . 1993 ) , ( 2 ) collimated radio jets ( e.g. , wilson 1981 ; taylor , dyson , & axon 1992 ) , and ( 3 ) thermal wind produced by the agn torus ( e.g. , krolik & begelman 1986 ; balsara & krolik 1993 ) or entrained along the radio ejecta ( e.g. , bicknell et al .",

    ", our group has been conducting an optical survey of nearby active and starburst galaxies combining fabry - perot imaging spectrophotometry with radio and x - ray data to track the energy flow of galactic winds through the various gas phases ( see reviews of recent results in cecil 2000 and veilleux 2000 ) .",
    "the complete spatial and kinematic sampling of the fabry - perot data is ideally suited to study the complex and extended morphology of the warm line - emitting material which is associated with the wind flow .",

    "near - infrared , extended emission embedded within the northern radio loop was recently detected by chapman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and deduced to be of non - stellar origin , adding support to the galactic outflow scenario .",
    "however , several fundamental questions remain : what is the geometry of the optical outflow ? how is it oriented with respect to the plane of the host galaxy ?",
    "what are the energetics involved in the outflow ? what is powering the outflow ?",

    "our paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we briefly describe the methods used to obtain and reduce our fabry - perot observations . the technique used to decompose the emission - line profiles of ngc  2992 into disk and outflow components",

    "we summarize our results in  6 and discuss future avenues of research .",
    "the taurus-2 fabry - perot interferometer ( taylor & atherton 1980 ) was used at the f/8 cassegrain focus of the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope to obtain in dark and photometric conditions 36 five - minute exposures of redshifted h@xmath0 in ngc 2992 .",
    "these data were obtained on 1994 march 10 using the tek 1024 x 1024 detector ( read noise , @xmath24 = 2.3 e@xmath25 , and pixel scale , 0@xmath23594  px@xmath8 ) under @xmath5 1@xmath235 seeing . a finesse 50 etalon with free spectral range 57   produced a velocity resolution of @xmath5 50 km s@xmath8 ( this etalon was borrowed from the hifi system ; bland & tully 1989 ) .",
    "an order separating filter with a flat - topped transmission profile centered at 6614   ( 55   fwhm ) passed only one etalon order so the true emission line profile of h@xmath0 could be synthesized .",
    "exposures were made of diffuse neon and flat continuum sources to wavelength calibrate and flatfield the images , respectively . finally , the photometric standard star @xmath26 hya was observed through the same setup as the object to provide an absolute flux calibration .",
    "these data were reduced using the methods described in bland & tully ( 1989 ) , veilleux et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and bland - hawthorn ( 1995 ) .",
    "the reduction procedure includes flat fielding , spatial registration of the frames , cosmic ray removal , correction for air mass variations , sky continuum and line subtraction , correction for the curvature of the isovelocity surfaces ( `` phase calibration '' ) , and flux calibration .",
    "the velocity calibration was verified using the oh sky line at 6604.13   ( osterbrock & martel 1992 ) .",
    "the data reduction produced a spectral datacube with two spatial and one spectral axes , the latter calibrated in units of wavelength .",
    "these data were spectrally smoothed using a 1/4  1/2  1/4 spectral filter ( hanning smoothing ) and then fit with gaussian emission - line profiles in a semi - autonomous fashion , using software developed by one of us ( pls ) .",
    "no attempt was made to correct for possible underlying balmer absorption .",
    "the profile of this feature is dominated by pressure broadening in the atmospheres of early - type stars , making this feature indistinguishable from a slowly varying continuum over the narrow spectral bandpass of our instrument .",
    "for the same reason , the broad h@xmath0 emission in the nucleus of ngc  2992 was not detected in our data .",
    "as a first coarse attempt , the h@xmath0 line in each spectrum was fit automatically with a single gaussian , regardless of the profile s precise shape .",
    "these fits allowed us to develop a rough understanding of both the kinematics and the morphology of the ionized gas emission .",
    "the rotation of the galaxy was clearly evident in the velocity structure of these fits , as were regions of radially expanding emission along the galaxy s minor axis . in terms of morphology",
    ", we were able to determine the spatial limits of the emission region , which eventually encompassed some 2,644 spectra .",
    "we also identified a narrow region through the center of the galaxy where the prominent dust lane substantially absorbs the h@xmath0 line emission .",
    "this region , including some 845 spectra , was not processed further , as the absorbed line profiles are too complex to allow meaningful gaussian fits with more than a single velocity component .",
    "this region has been noted on figure 2 .    following these coarse fits ,",
    "a more detailed series of gaussian fits were computed , using either one or two distinct velocity components for each spectrum . in certain cases , a third velocity component",
    "could perhaps be visually discerned , but the difficulty in constraining the larger number of degrees of freedom in such fits led us to limit ourselves to two components . in many regions , the presence of split ( i.e. , double ) line profiles is very evident , and such regions were manually fit with a pair of gaussian components , with no constraints on relative velocity or line width .",
    "these manual fits were then propagated in an automatic fashion across the emission region .",
    "manual intervention was required where regions of single- and double - component fits merged . in a few instances , the relative line widths of the two components were held constant , to provide more stable convergence of the fits .",
    "the result is a collection of 1- and 2-component fits to the h@xmath0 emission line across the galaxy , where the line velocities and fluxes are relatively smooth functions of spatial position .",
    "examples of fits to the line profiles are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the results from these fits are presented in figures 2 , 4 and 5 , and are used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the distribution of the h@xmath0-emitting gas in the disk and outflow components is shown in figure 2 along with the continuum emission near 6560   ( rest wavelength ) .",
    "these flux maps were corrected for extinction from our own galaxy [ e(b  v ) = 0.060 mag ; burstein & heiles 1982 ; schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ] but not for intrinsic reddening ( these corrections will be carried out in  5.1 ) .",

    "the redshifted component also presents a azimuthal velocity gradient indicative of residual rotational motion , which suggests that the outflowing material was lifted from the disk or that the underlying galactic disk is contributing slightly to this component .",
    "no significant gradient is detected in the blueshifted component .",
    "the widths ( fwhm ) of both components range from 50 km  s@xmath8 to more than 350 km  s@xmath8 , with flux - weighted averages of 200 and 150 km s@xmath8 for the blueshifted and redshifted components , respectively ( fig . 5 ) .    with the exception of the high - velocity ( 170  250 km @xmath8 relative to the systemic velocity ) nw cloud , more evident in figures 4 and 5 ,",
    "the outflow in the nw cone is well modeled by a single emission - line component with fwhm ranging from 75 km  s@xmath8 to about 350 km  s@xmath8 ( flux - weighted average of 200 km  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "that is to say most of the substructures detected in the emission - line profiles from the nw quadrant of ngc  2992 are due to the kinematic superposition of the disk and outflow components rather than to the presence of substructure in the outflow itself .",

    "the implied velocities in these powerful outflows typically are of order a few hundred km s@xmath8 ( although exceptions exist : e.g. , the outflow velocities in ngc  3079 exceed 1,500 km s@xmath8 ; veilleux et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the absence of line splitting on one side is sometimes due to obscuration by the disk ( e.g. , ngc  3079 ) .",
    "can the same thing be happening in ngc  2992 ?",
    "the geometry of the biconical outflow in ngc  2992 ( shown in figure 8) is such that the se outflow cone is in front of the galaxy disk and the base of the nw outflow is behind it .",
    "this may explain the large strength of the se outflow components relative to the ( undetected ? ) disk component .",
    "however , if the gas flows along the walls of the cones , one would expect to detect the blueshifted component of the nw outflow ( which is located on the near side of the cone ) more easily than the redshifted component ; the opposite is seen in ngc  2992 .",
    "high - resolution hst images of the outflows in m82 ( shopbell et al . 2000 ) and ngc  3079 ( cecil et al . 2000 ) indicate that the entrained material is not distributed uniformly on the surface of the bicones ( m82 ) or bubble ( ngc  3079 ) , but instead forms a complex network of clouds and filaments where some regions are sometimes devoid of line - emitting material .",
    "the near side of the nw cone of ngc  2992 may just be such a region .",
    "the absence of warm ( t @xmath3 10@xmath40 k ) line - emitting gas in this region does not preclude the existence of hot or molecular material which would only be detectable in the x - rays or at millimetric wavelengths , respectively .",
    "the biconical outflow model may be constrained further by comparing the velocities of the various kinematic components of the outflow . using the nomenclature and geometry of figure 8 ,",
    "we have @xmath41 = @xmath42  cos @xmath0 , @xmath43 = @xmath44  cos @xmath0 and @xmath45= @xmath46  cos @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( assuming @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 , and @xmath42 (= @xmath44 if the outflow is bi - symmetric ) and @xmath46 are the outflow velocities at the top and at the base of the bicone , respectively ( see fig . 8) . from our data , we measure @xmath51 = 25  220 ( 100 ) km  s@xmath8 , @xmath52 = 15  140 ( 40 ) km  s@xmath8 , and @xmath53 = 25  100 ( 40 ) km  s@xmath8 , where the values in parentheses are the flux - weighted ( @xmath3 mass - weighted ) averages . for this calculation ,",
    "the redshifted velocities in the se cone were corrected for residual rotational motion by subtracting the expected disk velocity field ( fig .",
    "7@xmath33 ) from our measured velocities . the results are not consistent with a constant outflow velocity : @xmath42 = 25  100 ( 40 ) km  s@xmath8 , @xmath46 = 40  150 ( 60 ) km  s@xmath8 , and @xmath44 = 25  220 ( 100 ) km  s@xmath8 .",
    "possible trends of decreasing outflow velocities with increasing distance from the nucleus may be present in the @xmath46 and @xmath44 components .    given the complexity of the velocity field in the outflow component , we do not feel that more elaborate modeling of the data is warranted at this stage .",
    "hence , there is no simple way of testing our assumption that the gas flows along the surface of the bicone .",
    "however , the large line widths of each of the three main outflow components suggest that the outflow is highly `` turbulent '' and that each of these components may in fact be the superposition of several filaments at different depths along our line sight .",
    "the broad range of velocities and general lack of line splitting in the nw cone may indicate that the line - emitting gas lies inside the biconical structure , filling in some of the velocity space between the front and back walls of the outflow . in this type of mass - loaded outflow ,",
    "the entrained gas is mixed in with the wind material . in this respect ,",
    "the nw wind of ngc  2992 may share a strong resemblance with the agn - driven winds of circinus ( e.g. , veilleux & bland - hawthorn 1997 ; elmouttie et al .",

    "moreover , we must emphasize again that the energetics derived in this section only take into account the optical ionized component of the outflow .",

    "three scenarios were mentioned in the introduction : ( 1 ) thermal wind from a circumnuclear starburst , ( 2 ) collimated radio jet , and ( 2 ) thermal wind produced by the agn .",
    "this scenario is attractive because it can readily explain the orientation of the outflow along the galaxy minor axis . in this picture , the kinetic energy from strong stellar winds of massive young stars and from type - ii supernovae is thermalized , producing a hot , overpressured cavity which bursts out along the minor axis of the galaxy disk entraining with it some of the ambient disk material ( e.g. , suchkov et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ) .",

    "the peculiar `` figure-8 '' radio structure detected on that scale ( ulvestad & wilson 1984 ; wehrle & morris 1988 ) is probably of synchrotron origin and is believed to have been produced by the agn ( wehrle & morris 1988 ) .",
    "the radio morphology is also a problem for the collimated jet - driven outflow model .",
    "ngc  2992 does not display the sub - kpc `` linear '' radio structures seen on arcsecond scale in @xmath36  30% of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , ulvestad & wilson 1989 ; pedlar et al .",
    "1993 and references therein ) .",
    "the resemblance of these linear structures to jet- and lobe - like structures in radio - loud agns has been used to argue for the existence of low - power nuclear jets in these seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , kukula et al . 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the diffuse radio structure of ngc  2992 suggests a more quiescent deposition of energy into the surrounding medium . equally damaging for the collimated jet model",

    "the absence of bright radio knots outside of the nucleus of ngc  2992 seems to rule out the possibility that the radio jet has been deflected by a dense cloud in the circumnuclear region ( as in ngc  1068 ; gallimore , baum , & odea 1996 ) .    however , the radio data of ngc  2992 do not rule out the possibility that the `` figure-8 '' structure represents radio lobes or bubbles of relativistic plasma ( `` plasmons '' ) fed on small ( @xmath22  0@xmath233 @xmath3 50 pc ) scale by collimated jets . the linear , supersonic motions of these plasmons may drive bowshocks into the ambient nuclear medium .",
    "several authors have studied the effects of a supersonic light jet or plasmon propagating into the circumnuclear medium of a galaxy ( e.g. , pedlar , dyson , & unger 1985 ; taylor et al .",
    "1989 ; taylor , dyson , & axon 1992 ; ferruit et al .",
    "1997a ; steffen et al .",
    "using classical equipartition arguments , one finds that the pressure in the relativistic plasma is inadequate to drive high - velocity shocks into the interstellar medium and produce the observed emission line flux . in all these models , the cooled shocked gas is therefore photoionized mainly by the ultraviolet nuclear continuum .",
    "these models have had significant success explaining the enlr of seyfert galaxies with linear radio structures ( e.g. , whittle et al .",

    "the lack of spatial correlation between the ridges of radio emission ( e.g. , the `` figure-8 '' structure ) and the optical line - emitting material participating in the outflow in ngc  2992 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of this model .",
    "recently , bicknell et al . (",
    "1998 ) have argued that the internal energy densities of many seyfert jets are dominated by thermal plasma rather than relativistic plasma , as it is generally believed to be the case in the more powerful radio galaxies .",
    "focussing on five well - studied seyferts including ngc  1068 , they have shown that an important fraction of the energy and momentum flux originally carried by the radio - emitting jet may be contained in entrained thermal plasma , which is not detected in synchrotron emission .",
    "veilleux et al .",

    "these `` jet - driven '' thermal winds are fundamentally different from the `` torus - driven '' wind of krolik & begelman ( 1986 ; see also balsara & krolik 1993 ) because the geometry of the former is regulated by that of the radio ejecta rather than by the opening angle of the sub - pc torus",
    ". however , these two types of winds may be difficult to differentiate on the kpc scale of the optical outflow in ngc  2992 , given the diffuse radio morphology of this object on that scale .",
    "allen et al . ( 1999 ) recently applied this jet - driven wind model to the narrow - line region of ngc  2992 and have argued based on the emission - line ratios that the enlr in ngc  2992 is powered by shocks with @xmath90 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "our analysis of the galactic outflow now provides additional constraints on this model .",
    "as discussed in  4.1 , we find the axis of the optical outflow bicone to be roughly aligned with the minor axis of the galaxy and the radio structure on large scale , but to be misaligned by @xmath5 44@xmath4 with respect to the major axis of the `` figure-8 '' radio structure on arcsecond scale . as first suggested by ulvestad & wilson ( 1984 ) , this misalignment may be caused by the differential thermal pressure across the radio structure due to static pressure gradients in the interstellar gas ( `` buoyancy effects '' , henriksen , valle , & bridle 1981 ; smith & norman 1981 ; fiedler & henriksen 1984 ) .",
    "the net buoyancy force on the radio ejecta of density @xmath91 immersed in a region of density @xmath92 will be @xmath93 @xmath94 , and will act to bend the trajectory of the radio plasma away from the major axis of the galaxy as seen in ngc  2992 .",
    "note that the large change in direction could not be explained in this fashion for the collimated - jet model (  5.2.2 ) because only the pressure difference across the jet thickness can contribute to the bending ( fiedler & henriksen 1984 ) .",
    "a potentially serious problem with the jet - fed thermal wind model is the relatively small outflow velocities detected in ngc  2992 ( recall that the flux - weighted average of the apparent outflow velocities is less than 100 km  s@xmath8 ;  4.3 ) .",
    "shock velocities of 300  500 km  s@xmath8 are needed to reproduce the line ratios in the enlr of ngc  2992 ( allen et al .",
    "although projection effects undoubtedly affect our measurements of the velocities , the corrections are probably not severe [ see fig . 8 ; the angle @xmath0 between our line of sight and the near - side ( far - side ) surface of the se ( nw ) cone is only @xmath5 3@xmath4 so our viewing angle should allow us to measure most of the actual outflow velocity if the motion is purely radial ] .",
    "however , one needs to be cautious when comparing shock velocities with gas outflow velocities : the outflow velocities derived from our fabry - perot data reflect the motion of the ( slow moving ) dense entrained material and are almost certainly smaller than the actual shock velocity .",
    "evidence for high - velocity shocks in ngc  2992 may be found at other wavelengths .",
    "shocks with velocity @xmath95 km  s@xmath8 will heat the ism to a temperature @xmath96 this gas may be responsible for some of the extended x - ray emission detected by colbert et al .",
    "rough estimates of the pressure of the x - ray emitting gas by colbert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggest that it is possibly well above the conventionally calculated non - thermal pressure  this hot gas may therefore be a dynamically important component of the outflow . given the current estimates of its density ( colbert et al .",
    "1998 ) , the x - ray emitting gas may also be an important contributor to the rate of mass ( and metal ) outflow in this object ( see  5.1 ) .",
    "definite answers to these questions will have to wait until chandra data on this object become available .",
    "these data may also be able to constrain the morphology ( jet - like or wide - angled ? ) of the x - ray gas on sufficiently small scale to help discriminate between the jet - driven wind model of bicknell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the torus - driven wind model of krolik & begelman ( 1986 ) and balsara & krolik ( 1993 ) .",
    "the optical line emission will be produced once the gas cools to @xmath97 k after @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the postshock density or four times the ambient proton density .",
    "the line - emitting gas will be displaced from the shock front by @xmath100 following dopita & sutherland ( 1996 ) , the total energy dissipated in the shock each second is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the shock surface area in pc@xmath103 , and the h@xmath0 luminosities from the shock and the precursor are @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively . using an ambient ( preshock ) ism density of @xmath51  @xmath59 and @xmath106 pc@xmath103 ( this is the area at the top of the bicones ) , we find that the expected h@xmath0 luminosity of the shock+precursor model is similar to the dereddened h@xmath0 luminosity of the outflow component . considering the large uncertainties on both the observed and predicted values , it seems physically possible to power a large fraction of the line emission across the bicone with shocks .",
    "allen et al . ( 1999 ) came to the same conclusion using line ratio arguments .",
    "the complete two - dimensional coverage of our fabry - perot data has allowed us to decompose the circumnuclear emission - line region of ngc  2992 into two distinct kinematic components : a rotational component which lies in the plane of the galactic disk and an outflowing component which traces a biconical wind along the minor axis of the galactic disk .",
    "outflow velocities ranging from 50 to 200 km  s@xmath8 are detected in the biconical region .",
    "the presence of two distinct kinematic components in one of the cones suggest that some ( but probably not all ) of the warm ionized material lies on the surface of the bicone . the mass ( @xmath5 1 @xmath9 10@xmath10 n@xmath11 m@xmath12 ) and kinematic energy ( @xmath5 4 @xmath9 10@xmath14 n@xmath11 ergs ) involved in this outflow",
    "are typical of other starburst- and agn - driven outflows .",
    "evidence for a slight rotational component in some of the entrained material located in front of the galactic disk suggests that this material has been lifted from the disk or that emission from the underlying disk is contributing to this component . the diffuse radio morphology and absence of direct evidence for a powerful nuclear starburst in this galaxy seem to rule out collimated radio jets or starburst - driven wind as the source of the outflow . by process of elimination ,",
    "the most likely scenario is that of a thermally - dominated wind diverted along the galaxy minor axis by the pressure gradient of the ism and powered on sub - kpc scale by ( yet undetected ) low - energy radio jets .",

    "<S> we report on a detailed kinematic study of the galactic - scale outflow in the seyfert galaxy ngc 2992 . </S>",
    "<S> the taurus-2 imaging fabry - perot interferometer was used on the anglo - australian 3.9-m telescope to derive the two - dimensional velocity field of the h@xmath0-emitting gas over the central arcminute of ngc 2992 . </S>",
    "<S> the complete two - dimensional coverage of the data combined with simple kinematic models of rotating axisymmetric disks allows us to differentiate the outflowing material from the line - emitting material associated with the galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of the disk component out to r = 3.0 kpc are well modeled by pure circular rotation in a plane inclined at @xmath1 from the plane of the sky and with kinematic major axis along p.a . </S>",
    "<S> = 32@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow component is distributed into two wide cones with opening angle @xmath3 125  135@xmath4 and extending @xmath5 2.8 kpc ( 18@xmath6 ) on both sides of the nucleus at nearly right angles ( @xmath7 ) to the disk kinematic major axis . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow on the se side of the nucleus is made of two distinct kinematic components interpreted as the front and back walls of a cone . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal velocity gradient in the back - wall component reflects residual rotational motion which indicates either that the outflowing material was lifted from the disk or that the underlying galactic disk is contributing slightly to this component . </S>",
    "<S> a single outflow component is detected in the nw cone . </S>",
    "<S> a biconical outflow model with velocities ranging from 50 to 200 km  s@xmath8 and oriented nearly perpendicular to the galactic disk can explain the data . </S>",
    "<S> the broad line profiles and asymmetries in the velocity fields suggest that some of the entrained line - emitting material may lie inside the biconical structure rather than only on the surface of the bicone . </S>",
    "<S> the mass involved in this outflow is of order @xmath5 1 @xmath9 10@xmath10 n@xmath11 m@xmath12 , and the bulk and `` turbulent '' kinematic energies are @xmath5 6 @xmath9 10@xmath13 n@xmath11 ergs and @xmath5 3 @xmath9 10@xmath14 n@xmath11 ergs , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely energy source is a hot bipolar thermal wind powered on sub - kpc scale by the agn and diverted along the galaxy minor axis by the pressure gradient of the ism in the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the data are not consistent with a starburst - driven wind or a collimated outflow powered by radio jets . </S>"
