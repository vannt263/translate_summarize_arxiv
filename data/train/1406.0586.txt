    "heat transfer at low reynolds numbers in turbulent / transitional channel flow is of practical importance .",
    "since the process of relaminarization is also important in the field of both engineering applications and fundamental flow physics , the transition from turbulence to laminar has been studied experimentally by a number of researchers .    in these days , the direct numerical simulation ( dns ) is a powerful tool to study the turbulent heat transfer in a channel .",
    "the first such dns was made by kim and moin @xcite with an assumption of uniform heat generation at @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is based on the friction velocity @xmath4 and the channel half width @xmath0 .",
    "lyons @xcite performed the simulation at @xmath5 with the constant temperature difference boundary condition . at the same reynolds number , kasagi @xcite executed dns under the condition of uniformly heated walls .",
    "later , the reynolds- and prandtl - number dependencies have been investigated by many research groups ( e.g. , kawamura @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "not much work has been done on dns of heat transfer in a turbulent / transitional channel flow for a lower reynolds number than @xmath5 .",
    "this might be because it would require a mcuh larger computational domain in order to capture an elongated streaky structure that is scaled in the wall units .",
    "as for the transitional channel flow without a scalar transport , iida and nagano @xcite carried out the dns at @xmath6@xmath7 to investigate the mechanisms of laminarization .",
    "the authors group @xcite showed that an isolated - turbulent structure ( termed ` puff - like structure ' in this paper ) was observed at @xmath8 by expanding the domain .",
    "the structure was found to be similar to the ` equilibrium turbulent puff ' in transitional pipe flows reported by wygnanski and champagne @xcite .",
    "since most channel flows in various engineering systems can undergo laminar - to - turbulent transition below the critical reynolds number given by the linear stability theory , the subcritical transition in a channel flow has also been studied in many works .",
    "an early experimental study on the transitional channel flow was made by davies & white @xcite .",
    "comparison of the existing experimental results indicates wide variation in the transitional reynolds numbers .",
    "patel & head @xcite obtained the transition reynolds number of about @xmath9 with high - intensity disturbance in an inlet flow .",
    "carlson @xcite made a flow - visualization study of turbulent spots with a smooth inlet in order to achieve a low - turbulence background flow .",
    "their observations indicated that natural turbulent spots appeared spontaneously , leading to a transition at @xmath10 ( defined in ) slightly above 1000 as in patel & head @xcite .",
    "these transitional reynolds numbers are less than 20% of the critical reynolds number ( @xmath11 ) by the ( two - dimensional ) linear instability analysis @xcite .",
    "later , theoretical results of orszag s group @xcite inferred a transitional reynolds number of about 1000 , when finite - amplitude three - dimensional disturbance was considered .",
    "these studies show the importance of nonlinear effects and of three - dimensional secondary instability associated with transitional structures , i.e. spatially localized turbulence such as spots and puffs .",
    "turbulent spots in a laminar channel flow have been studied extensively : turbulence characteristics inside a spot and its maintenance of turbulence were investigated in experiments by klingmann & alfredsson @xcite and dns by henningson & kim @xcite .",
    "the structure of puffs in a transitional pipe flow was studied by wygnanski s group @xcite and was found to be different from the structure of the fully - developed turbulent flow . in the transitional channel flow , the puff - like structure first observed by tsukahara @xcite , and this transitional structure must play a role in sustaining turbulence .",
    "few numerical studies had focused on the effect of the transitional structure in a channel flow at turbulent - laminar transition range .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to know a mechanism of scalar transport in the puff - like structure with respect to enhancement of heat transfer .    [",

    "one of the thermal boundary conditions is the uniform heat - flux heating over the both surfaces ( uhf ) , and the other is the constant temperature difference between the walls ( ctd ) .",

    "uniform grid mesh was used in the horizontal directions , and non - uniform mesh in the @xmath27 direction . a coarser mesh ( @xmath28 )",

    "the wall - normal grid spacings were @xmath29@xmath30 , which corresponded to @xmath31@xmath32 ( @xmath33 is referred to as a local kolmogorov scale ) .",
    "these grid spacings were finer than ones used by abe @xcite , whose grid resolutions were approximately equal to @xmath34@xmath35 .",

    "further integration for @xmath39 was necessary to obtain stable and accurate values of @xmath40 and presented here .",
    "the puff - like structure as mentioned in the introduction was observed in the present dns at even lower reynolds numbers than @xmath8 .",
    "( @xmath41 ) shows the instantaneous flow field accompanied by the turbulent puff , which is sustained and equilibrium for @xmath6@xmath42  ( xl ) .",
    "the quasi - streamwise vortices are well represented by the negative @xmath43 region , and the cluster of these fine - scale turbulent eddies is spatially isolated as seen in ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "note that the streaks elongated in the streamwise direction penetrate the computational domain in the case of lb , indicating a shortage of the box size .",

    "turning now to obtained from the present dns , it can be seen that a sustaining turbulence is obtained at as low as @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , which is consistent with the experimental results @xcite . at this reynolds number , turbulence is spatially intermittent , that is , coexistence of the turbulent puff - like structure and less turbulence in space . with decreasing @xmath36 , the intermittent flow is first observed at @xmath46 in the present dns : on the other hand , one may find in the literature that the intermittent flow in experiments occurred in the range of @xmath47 , cf .",
    "@xcite .    the isolated highly - disordered turbulent region , in which streaks are densely crowded ,",
    "is spatially distributed in both @xmath48 and @xmath49 directions , while the turbulent puff of a pipe is intermittent only in the streamwise direction @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed that this oblique structure in the channel flow was able to be captured even if an initial velocity field was a random distribution .",
    "thus one may regard the inclination of the puff - like structure as essential for a transitional channel flow . as can be seen from",
    ", we requires a large - scale domain such as xl to capture the puff in the channel flow .",
    "neither mb nor lb is large enough for the equilibrium to become established .",
    "it is interesting to note that the self - sustaining puff in xl remains dominant with decreasing @xmath3 from 64 to 60 , whereas the turbulent flow has become laminar with lb .    from the visualization of the thermal fields affected by the puff",
    ", it is observed that thermal streaks in uhf ( ( @xmath50 ) ) are not homogeneously distributed and similar to the velocity field .",
    "this is attributed to similarity of the boundary conditions . in the cases of @xmath51 and @xmath52 for uhf ,",
    "the visualized iso - surfaces of negative fluctuation show the low - speed ( low - temperature ) streaks in the wall region with an average spacing of @xmath7 wall units . they are packed together and most of them",
    "are located at downstream of the highly - disordered turbulent region .",
    "in addition , this dense clustering of negative ( also positive ) fluctuations clearly exhibits a very large - scale pattern in the uhf field .    in the case of ctd ,",
    "both high- and low - temperature regions tend to exist uniformly in the core region ( see ( @xmath53 ) ) .",
    "unlike uhf , the production of temperature variance for ctd is non - zero in the channel central region , and the location of maximum temperature variance is at the channel center .",
    "the thermal structure in the core region is dominant rather than the near - wall streak as seen from ( @xmath53 ) .",
