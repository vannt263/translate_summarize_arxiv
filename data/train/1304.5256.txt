    "kondo - heisenberg chains are simple model systems in which a ( one - dimensional ) luttinger liquid is coupled to a one - dimensional antiferromagnetic system by a kondo exchange interaction .",
    "systems of this type display a variety of non - trivial ground states with a dazzling array of unconventional behaviors.@xcite in particular , they have phases that exhibit a spin gap and have superconducting correlations with the peculiar aspect that their only viable order parameters are made of observables from the spin chain and of the luttinger liquid which separately have only short range correlations .",
    "kondo - heisenberg systems constitute an ideal testing ground in which the physics of strongly correlated electronic systems can be studied using controlled analytic approximations and powerful numerical methods .",
    "one of the phases that is well established to exist in the kondo - heisenberg chain is a state with a spin gap and long - range ( power - law ) superconducting correlations with finite momentum ( which is commensurate with the lattice of kondo - heisenberg spins ) .",
    "this state was identified in ref .",
    "[ ] as a pair - density - wave superconducting ( pdw ) state , i.e. a larkin - ovchinnikov state without an external zeeman ( magnetic ) field . in this paper we will consider the effects of next - nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange interactions in the spin chain . in the presence of such interactions",
    "the spin chain is frustrated and can be regarded as a zig - zag spin ladder .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine the phase diagram of this system as a function of the ratio of the kondo exchange interaction @xmath0 to the nearest - neighbor exchange interaction @xmath1 in the spin chain and of the ratio between the next - nearest - neighbor exchange interaction of the spin chain @xmath4 , as well as the interaction coupling constants of the luttinger liquid .",
    "one motivation for considering the role of frustration is to examine the mechanisms that determine the ordering wave - vector @xmath5 of a pair - density - wave state . in a one - dimensional fermionic system with at least two bands ( or species of fermions ) with attractive interactions it is possible to have a larkin - ovchinnikov state with any wave vector provided that the fermi points of the two species are different",
    "this is possible since in 1d there is always nesting of the fermi points .",
    "however , if the strongly correlated system has only repulsive interactions this problem is more subtle .",
    "for example , berg and coworkers @xcite found that in kondo - heisenberg chain the ordering wave - vector @xmath5 of the pdw is the same as the wave - vector of the antiferromagnetic order , which in turn is determined by the spacing of the kondo spins .",
    "this is true even though in such a spin - gap phase the magnetic order is short ranged .",
    "a similar result was obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] in the context of doped antiferromagnetic two - leg spin ladders , with the only difference that the ordering wave vector is determined by spontaneous - symmetry - breaking of translation invariance rather than the explicit breaking of translation invariance of the kondo - heisenberg chain . thus , in both cases the pdw order is commensurate .",
    "it is apparent that this commensurate state is the result of the magnetic origin of the mechanism of the pdw order , provided the su(2 ) magnetic symmetry is exact .",
    "this is true even in the case of the frustrated chain which , for @xmath2 larger than a critical value , at the classical level the frustrated heisenberg chain has a ground state with incommensurate spiral magnetic order . on the other hand , at the quantum level ,",
    "in the case of a chain of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom the ground state is dimerized and has short - ranged spin order.@xcite the short range magnetic order becomes incommensurate order for @xmath6 , the majumdar - ghosh point@xcite , where the dimerization is strongest .",
    "this behavior naturally poses the question of whether in a strictly one - dimensional system an incommensurate phase is possible at all .",
    "a ground stye with incommensurate magnetic order requires the existence of an additional gapless collective mode . in a one - dimensional system",
    "this is possible only if the effective low energy theory has an exactly marginal operator .",
    "however , the effective field theories of models with an exact su(2 ) symmetry ( and their generalizations ) are non - linear sigma models with compact target space manifolds .",
    "these target manifolds do not have flat directions and hence their ground states can only have massive ( gapped ) excitations.@xcite the only alternative to this gapped ground state is that the generalized non - linear sigma models may have a topological term . in this case",
    "the rg flows drives the system to a non - trivial finite conformally invariant fixed point .",
    "the only available fixed points with su(2 ) symmetry are wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) models with current algebras su(2)@xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is an integer ) ( or generalizations of these fixed points ) .",
    "however , fixed points of this class also do not have any exactly marginal operators .",
    "these arguments suggest that it is not possible to have a state with incommensurate magnetic order with exact su(2 ) spin invariance in one spatial dimension . the only way to circumvent this problem is either to break the magnetic symmetry explicitly , from su(2 ) down to a u(1 ) subgroup , as in the presence of magnetic anisotropy , which allows for magnetic spiral phases,@xcite or to consider a quasi - one - dimensional system in which the symmetry - breaking is spontaneous in the higher - dimensional system ( or by an explicit symmetry - breaking by an uniform magnetic field)@xcite nevertheless , although magnetic frustration in an su(2 ) invariant system does not lead to an incommensurate pdw phase in the 1d case we are discussing here , we will see that it does lead to non - trivial and interesting phases that will be discussed in some detail in this paper .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the nature of the ground state of a frustrated kondo - heisenberg model and the resulting phase diagram ( see fig . [",

    "this picture is appropriate for quasi - one - dimensional systems such as cs@xmath30cucl@xmath31.@xcite both coupling constants are taken to be antiferromagnetic .",

    "moreover , in this phase the dual field @xmath292 fluctuates wildly and vertex operators of the dual field have vanishing expectation values . therefore in this phase the field @xmath191 is massive and decouples from the low - energy physics .",

    "we will see , however , that these majorana fermions actually become massive .",
    "these considerations allow us to determine the behavior of the observables of interest .",

    "since , as we will see below , the majorana fermions @xmath192 and @xmath193 become massive , in this phase the scaling dimensions of @xmath224 and @xmath123 are the same as in the pdw phase .",
    "what is the difference between this regime and the pdw phase",
    "? so far looks almost identical to the pdw phase of the weakly frustrated kondo - heisenberg chain , albeit with different critical exponents if the majorana fermions @xmath192 and @xmath193 remain massless .",
    "microscopically , the main difference between this phase and the pdw phase of the weakly frustrated regime is that the latter phase in the symmetry of exchanging the two spin chains is broken , whereas superficially here it seems to be unbroken .",
    "let us examine this question more closely . from the structure of the effective hamiltonian , and of the observables",
    ", we see that what distinguishes this possible phase from the pdw phase is whether the product of ising twist fields @xmath297 has ( or has not ) a non - vanishing expectation value .",
    "this is achieved by combining both majorana fermions into a single dirac fermion @xmath298 and generating a dirac mass term or , equivalently , a majorana mass for both majorana fermions , i.e. the energy density operators of the two ising models . in particular , in the phase in which @xmath299 , the disorder operators have vanishing expectation value , @xmath300 , and vice versa ( by kramers - wannier duality ) . consequently across the phase transition the symmetric pdw operator , @xmath301 has short - range correlations , whereas the operator @xmath302 becomes the pdw order parameter of the weakly frustrated case .",
    "however , for the expectation value of the product of twist fields to be different from zero the the two remaining majorana fermions @xmath192 and @xmath193 must become massive .",
    "such a mass term can not be generated in the fractionalized fluid phase .",
    "however , a term of this form is generated from nominally irrelevant operators ( whose scaling dimension at the toulouse fixed point is @xmath137 and larger ) once the operator @xmath288 becomes marginally relevant and the field @xmath191 becomes massive . that this is correct can be seen form the identification of the spin currents , _",
    "e.g. _ eq .. these operators exist since at the microscopic level the symmetry of exchanging the two magnetic chains is explicitly broken .",
    "however , the operators that break this symmetry are irrelevant at the toulouse point and hence do not destabilize the gapless fractionalized spin fluid phase .",
    "irrelevant operators that break the symmetry of a system at a fixed point are known as dangerous irrelevant operators .",
    "such operators do not change the universality class of the phase transition but change the nature of the resulting stable phase .",
    "moreover , the backscattering current interactions of the spin currents of the two magnetic chains and of the 1d electronic system , eq . , contain operators that break this symmetry but which are irrelevant at the toulouse point and at the quantum phase transition out of the fractionalized gapless spin fluid phase .",
    "thus , the resulting phase is a pdw phase due to the existence of these dangerous irrelevant operators which are irrelevant at criticality but which lower the symmetry of the stable phase .",
    "in this paper we discussed the structure of the phase diagram of the frustrated kondo - heisenberg chain .",
    "in addition to the pdw phase discussed by berg , fradkin and kivelson,@xcite we find that quantum frustration of the heisenberg chain leads to the complex phase diagram shown in fig . [",

    "this phase is controlled by a stable fixed point at large @xmath0 and weak @xmath2 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath305 and @xmath0 small",
    "there is a dimerized phase of the spin chain ( with a spin gap ) coexisting with a spin-1/2 luttinger liquid in the 1d electronic system .",
    "the phase boundary between the dimerized spin chain+luttinger liquid ( d+ll ) is most likely weakly first order since the system at @xmath32 and @xmath306 is at a fixed point with two marginally relevant operators .",
    "3 .   a fractionalized spin liquid ( fsl ) phase with a gapless ( fractionalized ) spin fluid coexisting with a decoupled charge sector of the 1d electronic system .",
    "we investigated the nature of the quantum phase transition between the dimerized and the pdw phase and concluded that it most likely a first order transition .",
    "we also investigated the stability of the gapless spin fluid phase ( characterized by a stable fixed point of the toulouse form at finite @xmath0 ) and the nature of its correlation functions .",
    "we also showed that , for weak enough @xmath0 , there is a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type quantum phase transition from the gapless fractionalized spin fluid to another phase which , due to a dangerous irrelevant operator , it is physically equivalent to the pdw phase of the weakly frustrated regime .",
    "this kt transition most likely becomes a first order transition at large enough @xmath0 since in for @xmath307 the system is unstable to a flow either towards the toulouse fixed point ( tfp ) of towards the stable fixed point of the pdw phase .",
    "we have not found evidence a direct phase transition between the dimerized phase and the gapless fractionalized spin fluid .",
    "this suggests that either the pdw phase `` sneaks in '' between this phase and the dimerized phase even in the strong frustration regime or , what is far more likely , that there is a direct first order phase transition .",
    "one of our motivations for looking at the role of frustration in the spin chain was to find out if a magnetic mechanism can give rise to an incommensurate pdw phase in a system without attractive interactions .",
    "as we noted in the introduction such a mechanism appears to be forbidden in 1d systems with full su(2 ) spin rotational invariance .",
