    "in a previous paper , forshaw , kerley and shaw ( fks ) @xcite reported on a successful attempt to extract the cross - section for scattering colour dipoles of fixed transverse size off protons using both electroproduction and photoproduction @xmath3 total cross - section data , together with the constraint provided by the measured ratio of the diffraction dissociation cross - section to the total cross - section for real photons .",
    "subsequently , the same model has been applied to `` diffractive deep inelastic scatterring '' ( ddis ) @xmath4 @xcite and also to deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) @xmath5 @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the model was shown to yield predictions in agreement with the data @xcite with no adjustable parameters .",
    "the model can also be extended to diffractive vector meson production : @xmath6 where the squared centre of mass energy @xmath7 . in these processes",
    "the choice of vector meson , as well as of different photon virtualities , allows one to explore contributions from dipoles of different transverse sizes .",
    "the process also has the advantage that there is a wide range of available data .",
    "it ought also to provide important information on the poorly known light - cone wavefunctions of the the vector mesons .",
    "the aim of this paper is to confront the predictions of the dipole model with the hera data on @xmath8 and @xmath9 electroproduction .",
    "the predictions for @xmath10 production are best considered in conjunction with an analysis of open charm production , and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we shall focus on the fks model @xcite , but we also compare with the predictions of two other models : the golec - biernat - wsthoff ( gw ) saturation model @xcite ; and the recent `` colour glass condensate '' ( cgc ) model of iancu , itakura and munier @xcite . for the meson light - cone wavefunction , we shall consider three different anstze : the dosch , gousset , kulzinger and pirner ( dgkp ) @xcite model ; the nemchik , nikolaev , predazzi and zakharov ( nnpz ) @xcite model ; and a simple `` boosted gaussian '' wavefunction , which can be considered as a special case of the latter .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows . in the first two sections we summarise the dipole models used and",
    "discuss the forms chosen for the vector meson wavefunctions .",
    "we then compare their predictions with experiment before drawing our conclusions .",
    "in the colour dipole model @xcite , the eigenstates of the scattering ( diffraction ) operator are `` colour dipoles '' , i.e. quark - antiquark pairs of transverse size @xmath11 in which the quark carries a fraction @xmath12 of the photon s light - cone momentum in the convention where @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 where the momentum @xmath15 of the quark is @xmath16 . ] . in the proton s rest frame ,",
    "the formation of the dipole occurs on a timescale far longer than that of its interaction with the target proton .",
    "because of this , the forward imaginary amplitude for singly diffractive photoprocesses @xmath17 is assumed to factorise into a product of light - cone wavefunctions associated with the initial and final state particles @xmath18 and @xmath19 and a universal dipole cross - section @xmath20 , which contains all the dynamics of the interaction of the @xmath21 dipole with the target proton . in particular for reaction ( [ vmp ] ) one obtains @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the light - cone wavefunctions of the photon and vector meson respectively . the quark and antiquark helicities are labelled by @xmath25 and @xmath26 and we have suppressed reference to the meson and photon helicities .",
    "the dipole cross - section is usually assumed to be flavour independent since some flavour dependence enters indirectly at small @xmath27 through the definitions of @xmath28 ( see below ) . ] and , as implied by our notation , `` geometric '' , i.e. for a given @xmath29 , it is assumed to depend on the transverse dipole size , but not the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath12 . the light - cone wavefunctions do depend on the quark flavour , via their charges and masses .",
    "finally , the corresponding real part of the amplitude ( [ amplitude ] ) is either neglected or , as here , is estimated using analyticity .",
    "while the photon light - cone wavefunction can be calculated within perturbation theory , at least for small dipole sizes , the vector meson light - cone wavefunctions are not reliably known , and must be obtained from models .",
    "this will be discussed in the following section .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to the dipole cross - section , for which we shall consider three different models . since",
    "full details are given in the original papers , our treatment will be brief .",
    "the fks model @xcite is a two - component model @xmath30 in which each term has a regge type energy dependence on the dimensionless energy variable @xmath31 : @xmath32 @xmath33 this parametric form is chosen so that the hard term dominates at small @xmath11 and goes to zero like @xmath34 as @xmath35 in accordance with ideas of colour transparency , while the soft term dominates at larger @xmath36 fm , with a hadron - like soft pomeron behaviour .",
    "in addition , to allow for possible confinement effects in the photon wavefunction at large @xmath11 , fks modified the perturbative wavefunctions @xmath37 by multiplying them by an adjustable gaussian enhancement factor : @xmath38 where @xmath39 this behaviour is qualitatively suggested by an analysis @xcite of the scattering eigenstates in a generalised vector dominance model @xcite which provides a good description of the soft pomeron contribution to the nucleon structure function @xmath40 on both protons and nuclei @xcite .",
    "the free parameters in both the dipole cross - section and the photon wavefunction were then determined by a fit to structure function and real photoabsorption data .",
    "the resulting values are given in table 1 .",
    "having been obtained in this way , they were then used to predict successfully the cross - sections for other processes which depend solely on the dipole cross - section and the photon wavefunction , namely diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( ddis ) @xcite and deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting dipole cross - section is shown fig .",
    "[ fig : fksdipole ] . as can be seen , as @xmath29 increases the dipole cross - section grows most rapidly for small @xmath11 , where the hard term dominates , eventually exceeding the typically hadronic cross - section found for dipoles of large @xmath36 fm .",
    "this rise could well be tamed by unitarity or saturation effects @xcite .",
    "however , the authors have argued @xcite that such saturation effects are unlikely to be important until the top of the hera range and beyond , and they are not included in the fks model in its present form .",

    "we now turn back to the meson wavefunctions .",

    "the case of a simple gaussian wavefunction in the rest - frame , which we will refer to as a `` boosted gaussian wavefunction '' can be obtained by simply setting @xmath161 ( we still choose @xmath147 when considering this wavefunction ) .    at this point",
    "we comment on two issues associated with the behaviour of the coulomb part of the scalar wavefunction for small @xmath11 .",
    "the first is that ( [ nnpz - lc - wf ] ) diverges logarithmically as @xmath35 at @xmath140 .",

    "nevertheless , this singular behaviour does have a ( finite ) effect when computing the meson decay constant which depends upon the behaviour of the wavefunction at @xmath114 .",
    "the second issue is that when the scalar wavefunction ( [ nnpz - lc - wf ] ) is substituted into equations ( [ nnpz_l ] )  ( [ trandecay ] ) , the derivatives in @xmath11 give rise to inverse power divergences at @xmath114 when acting upon the running coupling ( [ running - alphas ] ) .",
    "however , these divergences occur solely in terms which are strictly higher order in @xmath153 .",
    "henceforth we discard these higher order terms , which is equivalent to omitting all derivatives of @xmath165 with respect to @xmath11 when differentiating the scalar wavefunction ( [ nnpz - lc - wf ] ) .",
    "we stress that none of these issues arise when using the boosted gaussian wavefunction .",
    "it remains to determine the various constants .",

    "here we follow a slightly modified procedure , since we want to be able to easily adjust the quark masses to those assumed in the various dipole models . specifically , we fixed @xmath160 at the value chosen by nnpz and vary the value of @xmath70 to give approximate agreement with the decay width constraints ( [ leptonic ] ) . in practice , we found it adequate to use the same @xmath70-value for both the fks and gw mass choices .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath70 and @xmath160 , with the associated values of the normalisation constants , are shown in table [ tab : nnpz - parameters ] , and are not very different from the original parameters of nnpz .",
