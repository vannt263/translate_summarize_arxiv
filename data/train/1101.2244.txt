    "the casimir force @xcite is caused by the existence of zero - point and thermal fluctuations of the quantized electromagnetic field . in the last few years physical phenomena grouped under the generic name of _ casimir effect",
    "_ have received much experimental and theoretical attention @xcite owing to numerous prospective applications in both fundamental and applied science .",
    "many theoretical results in casimir physics ( for instance , on the role of skin depth or surface roughness ) have already been experimentally confirmed ( see refs.@xcite and review@xcite ) .",
    "there is , however , one theoretical prediction made on the basis of the lifshitz theory @xcite which was unexpectedly found to be in contradiction with the experimental data .",
    "this is the large thermal effect in the casimir force at short separations caused by the relaxation properties of free charge carriers in metals,@xcite semiconductors and dielectrics.@xcite the respective experiments performed by means of micromechanical torsional oscillator,@xcite atomic force microscope @xcite and bose - einstein condensate confined in a magnetic trap @xcite excluded the predicted effect at a high confidence level .",
    "almost all experiments on measuring the casimir force between two macroscopic bodies were performed in the sphere - plate geometry.@xcite experiments exploiting the sphere - plate geometry can be separated into experiments with small spheres of micrometer - size radii @xcite and with large spherical lenses of centimeter - size curvature radii.@xcite in most of cases spherical surfaces were coated with au ( single exception is the experiment@xcite using a lens made of ge ) .",
    "small spheres ( from a few tens to hundreds of micrometer radii ) are usually made of polystyrene or sapphire .",
    "it is possible to control both global and local sphericity of small spheres microscopically by using , for instance , scanning electron microscopy .",
    "large spherical lenses from a few centimeters to more than 10 cm curvature radii are made of glass or some other material . allowed parameters of imperfections ( defects ) of their mechanically polished and ground surfaces",
    "are specified in the optical surface specification data provided by a producer ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "it should be stressed that different defects are necessarily present on the surface of each ( even of the best quality ) optical lens.@xcite the reason is that when the glass is first made it may already contain defects such as bubbles . in grinding and polishing ,",
    "a whole new set of surface defects such as scratches , digs , and chips may be introduced.@xcite in the subsequent technological operations of centering , beveling , cementing , and assembly , more defects are likely to be produced .",
    "the handling and operations involved in the numerous cleanings and inspections also add their quota of defects.@xcite because of this , such a specification as `` no bubbles or other imperfections permitted '' is impossible to fulfil.@xcite optical surface data specifying the parameters of defects permissible are obtained using scanning scattering microscopes , laser interference imaging profilometers and other techniques.@xcite the micrographs of different types of defects of optical surfaces taken with a differential interference contrast microscope can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the scanning electron microscope images of defects are contained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the most frequently present imperfections on lenses are digs , which include all hemispherical - appearing defects , and scratches whose length is usually much longer than the wavelength of the incident light.@xcite note that in the large - scale applied problem of lens design@xcite surface inperfections play a rather limited role .",
    "however , as is shown below , they are very important for such a nonstandard application of lenses as for measurements of the casimir force .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that although large thermal corrections to the casimir force at short separations were experimentally excluded , the thermal effect by itself in the configuration of two macrobodies has never been measured . in this",
    "respect experiments with lenses of large curvature radii attract much attention because they might allow measurements at separations of a few micrometers where predictions of alternative theoretical approaches ( taking into account or discarding relaxation properties of free charge carriers ) differ by up to 100% .",
    "experiments on measuring the casimir force using spherical lenses of large radius of curvature have faced serious problems .",
    "the point is that calibration of the casimir setup is usually performed by measuring electric forces between the sphere and plate from a potential difference applied to the test bodies ( some nonzero residual potential difference exists even when the test bodies are grounded ) .",
    "calibrations are performed by the comparison of the measured electric forces at different separations with the exact theoretical force - distance relation in the sphere - plate geometry , which is familiar from classical electrodynamics .",
    "problems emerged when an anomalous force - distance relation for the electric force between an au - coated spherical lens of @xmath0 cm curvature radius and a plate was observed,@xcite distinct from that predicted by classical electrodynamics ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the existence of anomalous electrostatic forces was also confirmed in the configuration of ge lens of @xmath1 cm curvature radius and ge plate,@xcite but denied @xcite for an au - coated small sphere of @xmath2 m radius interacting with an au - coated plate .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the anomalous behavior of the electrostatic force can be explained due to deviations of the mechanically polished and ground surface from a perfect spherical shape for lenses with centimeter - size curvature radii .",
    "different kinds of imperfections on such surfaces ( bubbles , pits and scretches ) can lead to significant deviations of the force - distance relation from the form predicted by classical electrodynamics under an assumption of perfectly spherical surface . later this possibility was recognized @xcite as a crucial point to be taken into account in future experiments not only in the sphere - plate geometry , but also for a cylindrical lens of centimeter - size radius of curvature near the plate .    in this paper",
    "we consider the possible imperfections on surfaces of lenses with centimeter - size radius of curvature , and calculate their impact on the casimir force .",
    "the point to note is that the casimir force is far more sensitive than the electrostatic force to the bubbles and pits that are always present on the mechanically polished and ground surfaces .",
    "the physical reason is that the casimir force falls with the increase of separation distance more rapidly than the electric force . as a result",
    ", the casimir force is determined by smaller regions near the points of closest approach of the two surfaces .",
    "if the local radius of curvature on the lens surface near the point of closest approach to the plate is significantly different from the mean radius of curvature @xmath3 , the impact of such surface imperfection on the casimir force can be tremendous .",
    "we show that the presence of bubbles and pits on a lens surface , allowed by the optical surface specification data , makes inapplicable the simplified formulation of the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) used @xcite for the comparison between experiment and theory .",
    "we also derive the expressions for the casimir force applicable in the presence of bubbles and pits on surfaces of centimeter - size lenses .",
    "it is shown that for ideal metal bodies surface imperfections may lead to both a decrease and an increase in the magnitude of the casimir force up to a few tens of percent for sphere - plate separations from 1 to @xmath4 m .    as discussed above",
    ", one might expect that experiments with large lenses will help to resolve the problem with the thermal casimir force . in this connection we consider real metal spherical lens , with surface imperfections of different types , close to a real metal plate both described either by the drude dielectric function",
    "( relaxation of free charge carriers is included ) or by the dielectric function of the plasma model where the relaxation parameter of free charge carriers is set to zero .",
    "we show , that the casimir force between a perfectly spherical lens and a plate , both described by the drude model , in the limit of experimental error , is equal to the casimir force between a lens with some specific surface imperfection and a plate , both described by the plasma model .",
    "vice versa , we demonstrate that if the metal surface of the perfectly shaped lens and a plate is described by the plasma model , this can lead to approximately the same casimir force over the separation region from 1 to @xmath4 m as for a lens with some imperfection and a plate , both described by the drude model .",
    "it has been known that experimentally it is hard to determine the position of the point of closest approach between a lens and a plate on the lens surface with sufficient precision .",
    "then it remains uncertain what kind of surface imperfection ( if any ) is located near the point of the closest approach .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that experiments with large spherical lenses are in fact unsuitable for resolving the problem of the thermal casimir force between real metals .",
    "results similar in spirit are obtained for an au - coated lens of centimeter - size radius of curvature interacting with a semiconductor or dielectric plate .",
    "we calculate the casimir force between a perfectly spherical au - coated lens and a dielectric ( high - resistivity si ) plate with the neglect of free charge carriers ( in so doing it makes almost no difference whether the drude or the plasma model is used for the description of au ) .",
    "we show then that approximately the same casimir force over the separation region from 1 to @xmath4 m is obtained for an au sphere with appropriately chosen surface imperfections and the following models of a semiconductor plate : 1 ) high - resistivity si with included dc conductivity ; 2 ) low - resistivity si with charge carriers described by the drude model ; 3 ) low - resistivity si with charge carriers described by the plasma model . here , free charge carriers of the au sphere are described by the drude model in cases 1 ) and 2 ) , and by the plasma model in the case 3 ) .",
    "thus , experiments with large spherical lenses are also not helpful for resolving the problem of dc conductivity of semiconductor or dielectric materials in the lifshitz theory .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we consider spherical lenses with surface imperfections of different types and derive the formulations of the pfa applicable for deformed spherical surfaces .",
    "demonstration of the influence of surface inperfections on the magnitude of the casimir force in the simplest case of ideal metal bodies is contained in sec .",
    "section  iv is devoted to the calculation of the casimir force between a real metal plate and a real metal lens with surface imperfections . in sec .",
    "v similar results are presented for a real metal lens interacting with a semiconductor or dielectric plate .",
    "our conclusions and discussions are contained in sec .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "i , the casimir force should be more sensitive than the electrostatic force to surface imperfections that are invariably present on the mechanically polished and ground surfaces of any lens of centimeter - size curvature radius",
    ". however , in experiments on measuring the casimir force in the lens - plate geometry , comparison between the measurement data and theory is usually performed by means of the simplified formulation of the pfa assuming perfect sphericity of the lens surface.@xcite we demonstrate first how this simplified formulation of the pfa is obtained from the most general formulation.@xcite then we apply the general formulation of the pfa to lenses with surface imperfections of different types .",
    "the most general formulation of the pfa represents the casimir force between a lens surface @xmath5 and a plate @xmath6 as an integral of the casimir pressures between pairs of plane surface elements spaced at separations @xmath5 : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the element of plate area , @xmath9 is the projection of the lens onto the plate , @xmath10 is the shortest separation between them , and @xmath11 is the pressure for two plane parallel plates at a separation @xmath5 at temperature @xmath12 .",
    "we choose the origin of a cylindrical coordinate system on the plane @xmath6 under the lens center .",
    "then for a perfectly shaped spherical lens of radius of curvature @xmath3 the coordinate @xmath13 of any point of its surface is given by @xmath14 in this case eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) leads to @xmath15 keeping in mind that the casimir pressure is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the free energy per unit area of parallel plates , and integrating by parts in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , one arrives at @xmath18 we consider centimeter - size spherical lenses satisfying conditions @xmath19 , @xmath20 . for such lenses @xmath21 .",
    "because of this , one can neglect the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) in comparison with the first.@xcite it can be also shown @xcite that the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is larger than the third by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "this allows one to neglect the third term and arrive to what is called the simplified formulation @xcite of the pfa @xmath23 widely used for both spherical lenses and for spheres [ note that for a semisphere the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is exactly equal to zero ] .",
    "the above derivation shows that the pfa in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) is applicable only at @xmath24 . for the real metal sphere ( spherical lens ) above real metal plate",
    "the analytic expressions for the casimir force in terms of scattering amplitudes are available,@xcite but due to computational difficulties numerical results were obtained only under the condition@xcite @xmath25 and under the condition@xcite @xmath26 .",
    "computations were performed for metals described by simple plasma and drude models@xcite and by the generalized plasma and drude models taking into account interband transitions of core electrons.@xcite the relative deviations between the obtained exact results for the casimir force and the approximate results calculated using the pfa in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) were found to be less than @xmath27 .",
    "it was demonstrated@xcite also that the pfa results approach the respective exact results with decreasing @xmath27 . keeping in mind that for the experiments performed to date with small spheres @xmath28% and for experiments with large spherical lenses @xmath29% , the use of the pfa for the comparison between experiment and theory is well justified .",
    "now we consider real lenses with centimeter - size radii of curvature .",
    "surfaces of such lenses are far from perfect , even excluding the rms roughness of a few nanometers from consideration . in optical technology quality of lens surfaces",
    "is characterized @xcite in terms of scratch and dig optical surface specification data .",
    "in particular , depending on the quality of the lens used , digs ( i.e. , bubbles and pits ) with a diameter varying @xcite from @xmath30 m to 1.2 mm are allowed on the surface .",
    "there may also be scratches on the surface with a width varying @xcite from 3 to @xmath31 m .",
    "the problem of bubbles on the centimeter - size lens surface should not be reduced to the fact that lens curvature radius @xmath3 is determined with some error .",
    "the thickness of each bubble or pit should of course be less than the absolute error in the measurement of lens radius of curvature ( for a lens @xcite with @xmath1 cm , for instance , @xmath32 cm ) .",
    "the crucial point is that curvature radii of bubbles and pits can be significantly different , as compared to @xmath3 .",
    "surface imperfections with these local radii of curvature , as we show below , can give a major contribution to the casimir force .",
    "as the first example we consider the lens with the curvature radius @xmath33 cm having a bubble of the radius of curvature @xmath34 cm and thickness @xmath35 m near the point of the closest approach to the plate [ see fig .",
    "the radius of the bubble is determined from @xmath36 , leading to @xmath37 mm , i.e. , less than a maximum value allowed @xcite by the optical surface specification data .",
    "the respective quantity @xmath38 defined in fig .",
    "1(a ) is equal to @xmath39 m .",
    "then the flattening of a lens surface at the point of closest approach to the plate is @xmath40 m which is much less than @xmath41 .    the general formulation of the pfa ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "should be applied taking into account that the surface of the bubble is described by the equation @xmath42 where @xmath10 is the distance between the bottom point of the bubble and the plate [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] . in this notation the surface of the lens",
    "is described by the equation @xmath43 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) one arrives , instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , at @xmath44 now we take into consideration that the quantities @xmath10 , @xmath38 , and @xmath45 are smaller than the error in the determination of large radii @xmath3 and @xmath46",
    ". then one can rearrange eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) to the form @xmath47 here , the first integral on the right - hand side is calculated similar to eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) leading to @xmath48 . calculating the second integral with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , one finally obtains @xmath49    now we consider two more examples of surface imperfection , specifically , a bubble with the curvature radius @xmath50 cm [ see fig .  1(b ) ] and a pit with the curvature radius @xmath51 cm [ see fig .",
    "1(c ) ] . in both cases",
    "the curvature radius of the lens remains the same @xmath33 cm .",
    "for the bubble we choose @xmath52 m which results in @xmath53 mm , @xmath54 m , and @xmath55 m in agreement with allowed values .",
    "equation ( [ eq11 ] ) is evidently preserved with the new values of parameters .",
    "now we deal with the pit shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) . here",
    ", the lens surface near the point of closest approach to the plate is concave up , i.e. , in the direction of the lens center .",
    "the related parameters are @xmath52 m , @xmath56 mm , @xmath57 m , and @xmath58 m .",
    "the pit surface is described by the equation @xmath59 here , @xmath10 is the separation distance between the plate and the points of the circle on the lens surface closest to it .",
    "the surface of the lens is described as @xmath60 repeating calculations that have led to eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) , we obtain @xmath61    it is evident that eqs .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) lead to significantly different results than the simplified formulation of the pfa in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that at separations @xmath62 m we get @xmath63 and all three contributions on the right - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this is confirmed by the results of numerical computations for both ideal metals ( sec .",
    "iii ) and for real materials ( secs .",
    "iv and v ) .",
    "we begin with the case of an ideal metal lens with surface imperfections shown in fig .",
    "1(a , b , c ) near the point of closest approach to an ideal metal plate .",
    "the case of ideal metal bodies , although it disregards real material properties , allows the demonstration of the entirely geometrical effect of surface imperfections on the casimir force .    to perform numerical computations by eqs .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) one needs convenient representation for the casimir free energy per unit area , @xmath17 , in the configuration of two parallel ideal metal plates . the standard expression for this quantity",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath64 here , @xmath65 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath66 is the magnitude of the projection of the wave vector on the plates , @xmath67 , @xmath68 with @xmath69 are the matsubara frequencies , and the primed summation sign means that the term with @xmath70 is multiplied by 1/2 .",
    "the most frequently used form of eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) separates it into the contribution of zero temperature and thermal correction . for our purpose , however , it is more convenient to present eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) as a sum of the high - temperature contribution to the free energy and the correction to it . for this purpose",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) in terms of a dimensionless integration variable @xmath71 and expand the logarithm in a power series @xmath72 here , the dimensionless parameter @xmath73 is defined as @xmath74 . after performing integration and then the summation with respect to @xmath75 , the following result is obtained : @xmath76 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "note that the first contribution on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) is just the high temperature limit of the free energy .",
    "this is seen if we take into account that @xmath78 , where the effective temperature is defined from @xmath79 , and , thus , @xmath80 when @xmath81 .",
    "now we are in a position to compute the casimir force between the spherical lens of large curvature radius with bubbles and pits of different types and a plane plate , both made of ideal metal . in the literature it is common to use the simplified formulation of the pfa ( [ eq6 ] ) in the sphere - plate geometry for both small spheres of about @xmath82 m radii and large spherical lenses .",
    "@xcite in doing so the role of bubbles and pits on the surface of lenses of centimeter - size curvature radii is neglected .",
    "equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , however , is not applicable for lenses with large radius of curvature because it assumes perfect spherical surface . for such lenses one should use more complicated results like those in eqs .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "to illustrate this fact , we perform calculations for three typical model imperfections on the spherical surface near the point of closest approach to the plate shown in fig .",
    "1(a , b , c ) .",
    "we begin with the surface imperfection shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , where the bottom of the spherical lens is flattened for approximately @xmath83 m ( see sec .",
    "computations of the casimir force @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , taking the bubble into account , and the force @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) for a lens with perfectly spherical surface were performed at @xmath86k with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) over the separation region from 1 to @xmath4 m .",
    "computations at larger separations would be not warranted because the experimental error quickly increases with the increase of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in the most well known measurement@xcite of the casimir force by using large lens the relative error at @xmath87 m was shown@xcite to be larger than 47% . in the experiment@xcite with ge test bodies the relative error in the measured casimir force exceeds 100% at @xmath88 m due to the error in subtracted residual electrostatic forces .",
    "the computational results for the ratio @xmath89 as a function of separation are presented in fig .  2 by the line labeled 1 .",
    "as can be seen in fig .  2 , in the presence of the bubble shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) for perfect spherical surface instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) considerably underestimates the magnitude of the casimir force .",
    "thus , at separations @xmath90 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , and @xmath91 m the quantity @xmath92 is equal to 1.458 , 1.361 , 1.287 , 1.233 , and 1.193 , respectively , i.e. , the underestimation varies from 46% at @xmath93 m to 19% at @xmath87 m .",
    "we continue with surface imperfection shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , where the thickness of an extra bulge on the spherical lens around its bottom point is approximately equal to @xmath94 m ( see sec .",

    "( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "the computed values of the quantity @xmath89 as a function of separation are shown by the line labeled 2 in fig .",
    "it can be seen that in this case the assumption of perfect sphericity of a lens surface considerably overestimates the magnitude of the casimir force .",
    "thus , at separations @xmath90 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , and @xmath91 m the values of the quantity @xmath92 are equal to 0.429 , 0.507 , 0.580 , 0.641 , and 0.689 , respectively , i.e. , overestimation varies from 57% at @xmath93 m to 36% at @xmath87 m .",
    "finally we consider the surface imperfection in the form of a pit presented in fig .",
    "1(c ) . here",
    ", the deformation of the lens surface is characterized by the parameter @xmath58 m .",
    "the computational results using eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) are shown by the line labeled 3 in fig .  2 .",
    "once again , the assumption of perfect lens sphericity significantly overestimates the magnitude of the casimir force .",
    "thus , at separations @xmath90 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , and @xmath91 m the ratio @xmath92 is equal to 0.314 , 0.409 , 0.496 , 0.570 , and 0.627 , respectively , i.e. , overestimation varies from 69% at @xmath93 m to 37% at @xmath87 m .",
    "thus , for an ideal metal lens above an ideal metal plate the use of the pfa in its simplest form ( [ eq6 ] ) can lead to the casimir force , either underestimated or overestimated by many tens of percent , depending on the character of imperfection on the lens surface near the point of closest approach to the plate .",
    "below we show that for a lens with a centimeter - size radius of curvature and a plate made of real materials the role of imperfections of the lens surface increases in importance .",
    "at separations above @xmath95 m the characteristic frequencies giving major contribution to the casimir force are sufficiently small . because of this",
    ", one can neglect the contribution of interband transitions and describe the metal of the test bodies by means of simple drude model .",
    "this leads to the dielectric permittivity depending on the frequency @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the plasma frequency and @xmath98 is the relaxation parameter .",
    "the dielectric permittivity ( [ eq18 ] ) takes into account relaxation properties of free electrons by means of the temperature - dependent relaxation parameter @xmath99 .",

    "this is explained by the fact that the use of nonlocal dielectric permittivities leads@xcite to the same equality , @xmath181 , as does the drude model ( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "thus , there is no need to consider nonlocal dielectric functions in connection with surface imperfections of lenses with centimeter - size curvature radii . for other fluctuation phenomenon , as radiative heat transfer , it was also calculated@xcite that at separations between two metallic semispaces @xmath182 nm the contribution of nonlocal effects into the heat flux is very small .",
    "similar results were obtained for an au - coated lens of centimeter - size radius of curvature above a si plate .",
    "it was shown that different models for the description of charge carriers in si ( dielectric si , high - resistivity si with account of dc conductivity , low - resistivity si described by the drude model , and low - resistivity si described by the plasma model ) lead to different theoretical predictions for the casimir force between a perfectly spherical au - coated lens and a si plate . however , by choosing an appropriate imperfection , well within the optical surface specification data , on the surface of the lens at the point of closest approach to the plate it is possible to obtain approximately the same casimir forces in all the above models over the separation region from 1 to @xmath4 m .",
    "the above results show that the presently accepted approach to the comparison of the data and theory in experiments@xcite measuring the casimir force by means of lenses with centimeter - size radii of curvature might be not sufficiently justified . in these experiments",

    "the possibility to return to the same point of closest approach in repeated measurements is all the more problematic . because of this",
    ", one can conclude that measurements of the casimir force using lenses of centimeter - size radii of curvature do not allow an unambiguous comparison to theory , and are not reproducible ( see refs.@xcite whose results are mutually contradictory ) . according to our results ,",
    "even if the measurement data for the casimir force are not consistent with any theoretical model under an assumption of perfect sphericity of the lens surface , there might be different types of surface imperfections leading to the consistency of the data with several theoretical approaches .",
    "we emphasize that only a few simple surface imperfections in the form of bubbles and pits are considered in this paper .",
    "there are many other imperfections of a more complicated shape ( including scratches ) which are allowed by the optical surface specification data and may strongly impact on the casimir force between a centimeter - size lens and a plate .",
    "such imperfections are randomly distributed on lens surfaces and some of them can be located in the immediate region of the point of closest approach to the plate .",
    "the role of au coatings used in measurements of the casimir force , should be investigated as well in the presence of surface imperfections .",
    "metallic coating of about @xmath121 m thickness @xcite might lead to a decrease of thicknesses of bubbles and depths of pits , but to an increase of their diameters .",
    "the latter , however , influences the magnitude of the casimir force most dramatically .",
