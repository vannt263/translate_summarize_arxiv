    "recent studies of the chaotic aspects of different complex systems have resulted in finding certain conditions under which the related chaos become _ ordered _ , predicted and deterministic . among these",
    "one may include the early ordered chaos found in the one - dimensional logistic maps @xcite or the optical `` chaos itinerancy '' @xcite in which the onset of chaos is done in a rather ordered manner .",
    "another known example of ordered chaos has been shown in @xcite for the one - dimensional periodic potential with constant slope in which the time series are produced by a tent map @xcite .",
    "the particle which passes through such a potential is shown @xcite to be under the influence of an ordered chaos which is effected in an unexpected drift in the opposite direction to that of the average potential gradient @xcite .",
    "it is also shown @xcite for the case of zero average gradient that the smaller becomes the widths of the potential barriers the more increased is the transition probability and the corresponding ordered chaos @xcite .",
    "we note that similar results were shown @xcite regarding the bounded one - dimensional multibarrier potential which certainly has no average gradient and in which the width of its barriers is inversely proportional to the number of them .",
    "it is found @xcite , analogously to @xcite , that the larger is the number of barriers along the same spatial length , which means that the smaller are their width , the higher becomes the transition probability of this system .",
    "thus , since the bounded multibarrier system was shown in @xcite to be chaotic then , according to the criterion in @xcite for ordered chaos , we conclude that this system belongs to the last class .",
    "we note that although the possible presence of quantum chaos is generally expected to exist in systems in which the classical limit is chaotic @xcite , there are , nevertheless , quantum systems which show chaotic signs without classical counterparts .",
    "this has been shown in @xcite for the quantum one - dimensional single barrier and in @xcite for the bounded one - dimensional multibarrier potential .",
    "also , the appearance of chaotic behaviour in these one - dimensional systems in @xcite is due to their being bounded and composed of a not large number of barriers .",
    "thus , in the limit of very large number of barriers arrayed along the whole axis as , for example , the one - dimensional kronig - penney system @xcite , one should not expect chaotic effects ( see also the discussion in @xcite of the localization - delocalization transition ) .",
    "our main goal in this work is to show that changing the number or ( and ) the width of the barriers results in the appearance of _ new _ ordered chaos which is effected in the form of periods .",
    "these are neither periods in time nor in space but periods in the number of barriers @xmath2 .",
    "we note that by the phrase new ordered chaos we do not mean that the observed wavepackets become less chaotic and complex but that the same chaotic structure is seems to be repeatedly observed as the number of barriers @xmath2 increases by specific values .",
    "we note , as mentioned , that chaoticlike effects were discussed in @xcite with respect to _",
    "one _ rectangular barrier and it was found that the chaotic appearance of the passing wavepacket as well as its correlation with the initial one critically depend upon the width of the single barrier .",
    "thus , it seems appropriate to extend the discussion to the multibarrier potential and find the conditions under which the related chaotic effects become periodically ordered .",
    "we use in our discussion the well known fact that a classical ( or semiclassical ) wavepacket spreads and becomes chaotic @xcite when it pass through a region along which a system of potential barriers ( or wells ) is arranged .",
    "the degree of the resulting chaos may be determined from the correlation @xcite between the initial and final forms of the passing particle ( wavepacket ) .",
    "thus , if this correlation turns out to be small then the initial wavepacket has been considerably changed and its chaotic effects have increased in the passage through the barriers . in the following we use the lanczos tridiagonalization method @xcite for calculating the correlation ( and , therefore , the degree of chaos ) between the initial wavepacket and the one which emerges from the potential array .",
    "we show , using the obtained data of the correlation , that the passing chaotic wavepackets are , under cetain values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( which is the ratio of total interval to total width of the potential array ) , strictly periodic and predicted .",
    "that is , suppose that a specific wavepacket which pass through a multibarrier potential with a given @xmath2 , @xmath3 and total length @xmath4 assumes some specific form .",
    "then it is shown that the same initial wavepacket assumes exactly the same form with the corresponding correlation when it pass through @xmath5 barriers arranged along the same length @xmath4 and @xmath3 where @xmath6 is the positive numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the periods .",
    "we also show that although the passing wavepackets are highly sensitive to variations of the ratio @xmath3 , there are , nevertheless , some specific values of @xmath2 for which the waveforms and the corresponding correlations are preserved for whole ranges of @xmath3 .    in section 2 we present the bounded one - dimensional multibarrier potential and the formalism of the energy level statistics @xcite used for discussing its chaotic properties .",
    "this method were used in @xcite for demonstrating that this system is chaotic .",
    "we use here numerical analysis for further discussing the mentioned periodic ordered aspect of these chaotic effects .",
    "we show the dependence of the passing wavepackets ( and their corresponding correlations with the given initial one ) upon the number of barriers @xmath2 and the ratio @xmath3 . in section 3",
    "we demonstrate the mentioned order which is effected : ( 1 ) through the remarked periods @xmath8 which turns out to be of two kinds ; one is very frequent and is effective for a large specific values of @xmath2 and the other is rare and shows up only in two specific values of @xmath2 ( from the range @xmath9 ) and ( 2 ) through the constancy of the passing wavepackets and their related correlations for certain ranges of the ratio @xmath3 . in table 1 we show the correlations for some specific values of @xmath2 and for 6 different values of the ratio @xmath3 and indicate the correlations which are periodic .",
    "we conclude in section 4 with a summary of the main points .",
    "the bounded one - dimensional multibarrier potential discussed here is supposed to be arranged along the @xmath10 axis between the points @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "assuming that the number of barriers in the system is @xmath2 one may introduce @xcite the variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 which respectively denote the total width of the @xmath2 barriers , where the potential @xmath15 satisfies @xmath16 , and the total interval among them where @xmath17 .",
    "thus , one may realize @xcite that the width of each barrier is @xmath18 and the interval between any two neighbouring ones is @xmath19 . denoting the ratio of @xmath14 to @xmath13 by @xmath3 and the total length of the system @xmath20 by @xmath4 one may express @xcite @xmath13 and @xmath14 in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath4 as    @xmath21    the possible existence of chaotic properties for any bounded one - dimensional multibarrier ( or multiwell ) potential system",
    "is usually determined by applying the energy level statistics @xcite . in this method one begins from the following two - dimensional matrix equation @xmath22=\\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } s_{11}&s_{12 } \\\\",
    "s_{21 } & s_{22 }   \\end{array } \\right]\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_{0 } \\\\",
    "b_{2n+1 }   \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the amplitudes of the transmitted and reflected parts respectively of the passing wavapacket from the @xmath2-th potential barrier .",
    "@xmath25 is the transmission coefficient of the initial wave that approach the first barrier and @xmath26 is the reflected part from this barrier .",
    "the components @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the matrix elements of the two - dimensional @xmath31 matrix which are related to the corresponding transfer matrix @xmath32 of the multibarrier potential ( see , for example , eqs ( 21 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the energy level statistics method @xcite is used by imposing boundary value conditions at the remote boundaries of the system . in @xcite periodic boundary conditions",
    "are used at the points @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is much larger than the total length @xmath35 of the system , so that one obtains @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the wavepackets at the points @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . using eqs ( [ e3 ] )",
    "one may write eq ( [ e2 ] ) as @xmath41=\\frac{f(r)}{f(-r ) } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c c } s_{11}&s_{12 } \\\\",
    "s_{21 } & s_{22 }   \\end{array } \\right]\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } a_{2n+1 } \\\\",
    "b_{0 } \\end{array }    \\right]\\ ] ] in order to obtain a nontrivial solution for the vector @xmath42 $ ] we must solve the following equation @xmath43 = 0\\ ] ] in @xcite we have used for @xmath44 the plane wave @xmath45 and have expressed the @xmath31 matrix elements in terms of the known transfer matrix elements ( see eqs ( 15 ) and ( 21 ) in @xcite ) . as a result of these substitutions one obtains from eq ( [ e5 ] ) , as in @xcite , a complex equation from which the appropriate energies which correspond to its real and imaginary parts are derived .",
    "figure ( 8) in @xcite shows the level spacing distribution of these energies in the form of a histogram which is clearly of the chaotic wigner type @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use , instead of plane waves , a semiclassical complex gaussian wavepacket since this kind of wave function tends easily to be deformed and becomes chaotic upon passing a multibarrier ( or multiwell ) potential @xcite .",
    "also , the semiclassical character of the wavepacket enables one to simultaneously discuss , as done in the following , its momentum and position .",
    "note that even in the quantum regime one may introduce the coherent state formalism @xcite which allows one @xcite to simultaneously define the expectation values of the conjugate variables @xmath32 and @xmath8 .",
    "we note that in the numerical part of this work all the wavepackets ( denoted @xmath46 ) , including the initial one , are numerically and graphically constructed from a given complex gaussian packet @xmath47 given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the initial value of the mean position of the packet in coordinate space and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the initial momentum and width in @xmath52 space .",
    "the width @xmath51 is , actually , the initial uncertainty in the momentum . for an effective numerical simulation",
    "the space and time variables were discretized @xcite with a resolution of @xmath53 and @xmath54 so that we obtain @xmath55 which is necessary for stabilizing and steadying the relevant numerical method @xcite .",
    "for the initial @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 we choose the values of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in the semiclassical discussion adopted here",
    "we assume that the wavepacket is associated with a particle of mass @xmath59 where for @xmath59 we assign the value of @xmath60 .",
    "thus , as in @xcite , the units we use for @xmath10 , @xmath61 and @xmath52 are @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "that is , one may realize in this scaling that the velocities in @xmath65 are related to the mentioned parameters @xmath10 and @xmath61 by @xmath66 . in order to maintain the condition of @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the energy of the passing wavepacket , we assign for the constant height of the barriers the value of @xmath69 .    the initial wavepacket which approach the multibarrier potential",
    "is expressed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the real and imaginary parts respectively of @xmath47 from eq ( [ e6 ] ) .",
    "the initial wavepacket of eq ( [ e7 ] ) is shown at the left hand side panel of figure 1 .",
    "we note that by its definition the initial wavepacket @xmath73 from eq ( [ e7 ] ) spreads with time without having to pass through any potential ( see eq ( [ e6 ] ) ) .",
    "we are not interested here in this kind of known spreading but , especially , want to track and follow the unknown chaotic - like deformation of the packet due to its passage through the multibarrier potential .",
    "thus , we numerically follow the time evolution of the real and imaginary parts through the multibarrier potential and obtain the passing wavepacket as @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote the real and imaginary parts of @xmath47 after passing through the multibarrier potential .",
    "we note that the number of the different chaotic wavepackets which evolve from the initial wavepacket of eq ( [ e7 ] ) is very large .",
    "for example , by slightly changing the ratio @xmath3 or by adding or removing even one barrier results in a completely different wavepacket compared to the one which corresponds to the potential before the change .",
    "since the passing wavepacket becomes chaotic there is generally no rule that controls its form or the correlation @xmath77 between it and the initial wavepacket from eq ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "as remarked , we show in the following section that for certain values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 one may predict the forms , and therefore the related correlation , of the passing wavepackets .",
    "the right hand side panel of figure 1 shows how the initial wavepacket from the left hand side expands and become deformed at time @xmath78 after passing through a ten - barrier potential whose ratio @xmath3 is unity .",
    "the influence of changing @xmath2 upon the passing wavepacket and its corresponding correlation @xmath77 is further demonstrated at the left hand side panel of figure 2 which shows the waveform obtained for the same @xmath3 and @xmath61 as those of the right hand side panel of figure 1 but for a 15 barrier potential .",
    "note that by increasing @xmath2 by 5 the wave packet becomes more chaotic and deformed compared to that at the right hand side of figure 1 .",
    "the dependence of the passing wavepacket upon @xmath3 is shown at the right hand side panel of figure 2 which is drawn for the same @xmath2 and @xmath61 as those of the left hand side but for @xmath79 . that is",
    ", decreasing @xmath3 from unity to @xmath80 causes the passing wavepacket to become much less complex and chaotic compared to the form at the left hand side .",
    "we refer in the following to table 1 which shows the correlation between the same initial wavepacket of eq ( [ e7 ] ) and the passing one for 40 values of @xmath2 and for six different values of @xmath3 : @xmath81 . the spatial length of the multibarrier was fixed to @xmath82 and the time at which all the passing wavepackets were calculated is @xmath78 which corresponds to increasing 300 times the mentioned time interval of @xmath54 .",
    "thus , at this time the initial wavepacket have passed through all the barriers arranged along the fixed length of @xmath4 .",
    "each of the tabulated values of the correlation was numerically calculated using the lanczos tridiagonalization method @xcite which yields a tridiagonal matrix the values in its principal diagonal are the sought - for correlations . in this method",
    "the better and accurate result is given by the matrix element located at the bottom of the principal diagonal .",
    "thus , the larger is the tridiagonal matrix the more accurate becomes the correlation associated with this matrix element .",
    "this is due to the large number of numerically running the program which generally yields better results .",
    "we note , however , that the exact values of the correlation is not of our main concern here but especially we concentrate our attention upon its dependence on @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "these dependencies may be established even from a small tridiagonal matrix if we use consistently the same order of it for all @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we use for all the numerical work here a third order lanczos tridiagonalization matrix .",
    "an example of such a matrix is the following one which corresponds to @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath82 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath78 and @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath85\\ ] ] the values of the correlation between the passing wavepacket at the time @xmath78 and the initial one from eq ( [ e7 ] ) are tabulated along the principal diagonal .",
    "the value of @xmath86 at the bottom of this diagonal is , as remarked , more accurate than the two other values .",
    "the tridiagonal matrix is symmetric which means that the off diagonal matrix elements which are symmetrically located about the principal diagonal are equal .",
    "these off diagonal elements are the normalizing factors of the diagonal elements @xcite .",
    "each one of the values tabulated in table 1 is obtained from the bottom value of the principal diagonal of the corresponding tridiagonal matrix .",
    "the 40 rows in table 1 correspond to the three representative ranges of @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 and the six columns to the six values of the ratio @xmath90 .",
    "as seen from the table the correlation ranges , for the specific values given here to the related parameters @xmath91 and @xmath61 , over values which greatly differ among them .",
    "thus , in order to be able to graphically plot the correlation as function of @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) one have to scale the ordinate axis in a log basis as done in figure 3 - 4 .",
    "we must remark that figures 3 - 5 are constructed not only from the tabulated values of table 1 but also from other values which are not given in this table .",
    "that is , the correlation values used for figures 3 - 5 are for all @xmath2 from @xmath92 and for @xmath90 . from table 1 and figures 3 - 4",
    "one may realize that the correlation changes in a stochastic and unexpected manner even when adding or removing only one barrier .",
    "also , one may see that the larger values of the correlation @xmath77 are found at either large or small values of the ratio @xmath3 and the smaller values of @xmath77 are found at the intermediate values of @xmath3 .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 in which we compare at the left hand side panel of it the correlation @xmath77 as function of @xmath2 for @xmath93 ( continuous curve ) , @xmath83 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath94 ( dashdot curve ) . at the right hand side panel of figure 3",
    "we compare the correlation @xmath77 , as function of @xmath2 , for @xmath93 ( continuous curve ) , @xmath95 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath96 ( dashdot curve ) .",
    "remembering that the ordinate is scaled in a log basis one may realize , for example , how large is the difference for @xmath97 between the correlation for @xmath93 and those obtained for @xmath94 , @xmath96 and @xmath95 .",
    "similar differences are demonstrated at the left hand side panel of figure 4 where the correlation @xmath77 , as function of @xmath2 , for @xmath98 ( continuous curve ) is compared to those for @xmath83 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath94 ( dashdot curve ) .",
    "note again the large differences for @xmath99 between the correlation @xmath77 obtained for @xmath94 and those for @xmath98 and @xmath83 .",
    "the similarity of the correlations for large and small @xmath3 is demonstrated at the right hand side panel of figure 4 where we compare @xmath77 for @xmath93 ( continuous curve ) to that for @xmath98 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "note , however , the large difference between these correlations for @xmath100 where the @xmath77 s for @xmath93 are much larger compared to those for @xmath98 .    from table 1 and",
    "the corresponding panels of figures 3 - 4 one finds the appropriate @xmath2 and @xmath3 for constructing a bounded one - dimensional multibarrier potential from which one may obtain a large correlation between the initial and final wavepackets .",
    "as realized from the former section the wavepacket which passes through the multibarrier potential becomes deformed and chaotic and the emerging waveforms are quite different even for neighbouring values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "that is , the resulting waveforms @xmath101 and the corresponding correlations @xmath77 depend upon @xmath3 and @xmath2 in such a manner that slightly changing either one of them results in a large change of @xmath101 and @xmath77 .",
    "we have , nevertheless , found that there exists an unexpected order among the multitude of the chaotic waveforms and the corresponding correlations .",
    "this order is reflected in periodicities which are clearly observed for specific values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "that is , we find that exactly the same identical wavepackets emerge from the potential barriers when the number of the latter increases by specific numbers @xmath8 or by any integral multiplication of them where the total spatial length of the system and the ratio @xmath3 remain fixed .",
    "the specific periods @xmath8 are found to be of two kinds : a large period of @xmath102 and a small one of @xmath103 .",
    "that is , if the relevant @xmath2 ( for a specific @xmath3 ) is periodic then exactly the same wavepacket emerge from all the potentials which have @xmath5 barriers where @xmath6 denote the whole numbers @xmath104 and @xmath8 is either the large period of 140 or the smaller one of 28 .",
    "note that since @xmath105 then any @xmath2 and @xmath3 which are characterized as being periodic with the small period of 28 are also automatically periodic with the larger period of 140 .    the large period of 140 is found to be very frequent and common for a large number of different @xmath3 and @xmath2 whereas the smaller period of 28 is rare .",
    "the criterion used here for characterizing any pair of @xmath2 and @xmath3 as periodic is that they have the same identical tridiagonal matrix for all @xmath5 where @xmath106 and @xmath8 is either 140 or 28 . in table 1",
    "we have denoted the multibarrier potentials which are periodic with the large period of 140 by the word @xmath52 attached to the numerical values of the corresponding correlations @xmath77 .",
    "all the other values in table 1 in which the word @xmath52 is absent are nonperiodic .",
    "thus , as seen from the table there exists a large number of periodic multibarrier potentials which produce the same wavepackets and the same correlations when the number of barriers are increased by 140 or by any integral multiplication of it .",
    "it is found ( see table 1 ) that the smaller is the number of barriers @xmath2 the more frequent is the number of the nonperiodic potentials and as @xmath2 increases the periodicity of the corresponding multibarrier potentials becomes more common and frequent .    in figure 5",
    "we have schematically drawn for the six values of @xmath3 the correlations @xmath77 as functions of @xmath2 from the point of view of whether they are periodic with the large period of 140 or not .",
    "that is , each periodic @xmath77 , which corresponds to some epecific @xmath2 and @xmath3 , is denoted by a point and the absence of this point for some given @xmath2 and @xmath3 signifies that the relevant @xmath77 is nonperiodic .",
    "note that , as remarked , the values of @xmath2 used in this figure are not only those of table 1 but all the values of @xmath107 . from the frequent occurence of the gaps in the horizontal lines of figure 5 for small @xmath2 and from the width of these gaps",
    "one may realize that there exists a large number of nonperiodic correlations @xmath77 at these values of @xmath2 .",
    "the larger @xmath2 becomes the more rare and narrow these gaps become which means that the number of the periodic correlations @xmath77 increases for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "for very high values of @xmath2 ( not shown in figure 5 ) the continuous linear sections become very long for all @xmath3 which means that all the wavepackets as well as their corresponding correlations are periodic with the large period of 140 .    regarding the smaller period of 28 we have found that it exists for the two pairs of ( @xmath93 , @xmath108 ) and ( @xmath98 , @xmath109 ) .",
    "that is , the same identical tridiagonal matrix , which implies the same emerging wavepacket and correlation , is obtained for the @xmath93 case for all potentials ( arranged along the same fixed length of @xmath82 ) which have @xmath110 barriers where @xmath111 .",
    "likewise , for the @xmath98 case one obtains the same tridiagonal matrix , wavepacket and correlation ( which are not the same as those of the formerly discussed @xmath93 case ) for all potentials which have @xmath112 barriers arrayed along the same fixed length of @xmath82 where @xmath111 .",
    "another kind of ordered regularity which we have found among the multitude of all the chaotic wavepackets is related to some specific tridiagonal matrices ( and , therefore , to their corresponding wavepackets and correlations ) which remain constant even when the ratio @xmath3 changes .",
    "that is , although the general behaviour is the unexpected change and deformation of the passing wavepacket when @xmath3 changes even slightly there exist , nevertheless , specific values of @xmath2 which are characterized as related to correlations and wavepackets which retain their forms even when @xmath3 is changed .",
    "for example , for @xmath113 we have found that the same tridiagonal matrix ( which means the same wavepacket and correlation ) remains constant for @xmath114 .",
    "the same situation is also encountered for @xmath115 where this time the constancy of the matrix , wavepacket and correlation are retained for the larger range of @xmath116 .",
    "the relevant tridiagonal matrix for the last case is @xmath117\\ ] ] the same situation is again encountered for other values of @xmath2 for which one finds constant different matrices .",
    "these @xmath2 s and the corresponding ranges of @xmath3 over which the emerging wavepackets ( and the appropriate correlations @xmath77 ) retain their forms are ; at @xmath118 for @xmath119 , at @xmath120 for @xmath121 and at @xmath122 , @xmath120 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 for @xmath125 .",
    "note that all these values of @xmath2 are also characterized as being periodic with the large period of 140 .",
    "thus , one may realize that the constancy of the relevant tridiagonal matrices ( and the corresponding wavepackets and correlations ) are retained not only for these specific @xmath2 but also for all the other @xmath2 s obtained by increasing them by 140 or by any integral multiplication of it . in other words , this behaviour of constant waveforms ( and correlations ) when @xmath3 changes is strongly related to the previously mentioned behaviour of periodic waveforms ( and correlations ) when the number of barriers , for these specific @xmath2 and @xmath3 , increases by 140 or by any integral multiplication of it .",
    "we have discussed the chaotic deformed wavepackets which come out of a bounded one - dimensional multibarrier potential and study the correlation of these wavepackets with the initial one .",
    "it has been shown , using the lanczos tridiagonalization method , that there exists an unexpected order and regularity among the multitude of all the possible chaotic wavepackets which come out of this system .",
    "this order is characterized by the existence of two periods through which one may obtain the same wavepackets and correlations when the number of barriers increase , for some specific @xmath2 and @xmath3 , by either 140 or 28 or by any integral multiplication of them .",
    "the more common and frequent period is that of 140 whereas the smaller one of 28 is rare .",
    "any wavepacket and its corresponding correlation which is periodic with the small period is also automatically periodic with the larger one .",
    "the correlation @xmath77 , as function of either @xmath2 or ( and ) @xmath3 , between the passing wavepackets and the initial one is stochastic and discontinuous as may be realized from table 1 and figures 3 - 4 .",
    "one may see from these figures and from table 1 that the larger values of @xmath77 are obtained for @xmath126 or @xmath127 .",
    "another ordered behaviour that we have found is related to the constancy of the wavepackets and the corresponding correlations for specific @xmath2 and for whole ranges of @xmath3 that may be as large as @xmath128 .",
    "all these @xmath2 s are also characterized as being periodic with the large period of 140 .",
    ".[table1 ] the table shows the correlations @xmath77 between the passing wavepacket at time @xmath78 and the initial one from eq ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "the rows correspond to the three ranges of @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",
    "the columns correspond to the ratio @xmath3 for @xmath132 .",
    "any @xmath2 which have correlation @xmath77 with the word @xmath52 attached to it is periodic with the large period of 140 .",
