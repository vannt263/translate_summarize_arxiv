    "given the degree sequence @xmath0 of a simple graph , the _ havel  hakimi algorithm _ is the procedure that iteratively removes a largest term @xmath1 from the sequence and subtracts 1 from the @xmath1 largest remaining terms , stopping when a list of zeroes is produced .",

    "[ cor : s and classes ] the class @xmath15 contains all matrogenic graphs ( and hence all matroidal and threshold graphs as well ) .    further motivation for studying @xmath15 comes from the connection between the havel  hakimi residue and the independence number of a graph .",
    "it follows from the definition of the strong havel ",
    "hakimi property that",

    "in particular , it is an open problem to find a nontrivial answer to the following question .",
    "[ question ]    in considering when the residue of a graph equals its independence number , it seems natural to consider procedures that generate independent sets by removing high - degree vertices .",
    "the simplest such heuristic , which has been called maxine  @xcite , begins with a graph @xmath8 and , as long as the current graph contains any edges , iteratively chooses and deletes a vertex of maximum degree .",
    "the vertices that remain at the completion of the process necessarily form an independent set in @xmath8 , and the size @xmath35 of this set is clearly a lower bound on @xmath32 .",
    "we note that different choices of a vertex of maximum degree can result in different sizes of independent sets ; performing maxine on the 5-vertex path can yield an independent set of size @xmath35 equal to either 2 ( which equals the residue ) or 3 ( which equals the independence number ) , depending on which vertex is deleted first .",
    "still , griggs and kleitman proved the following :    if @xmath35 is the size of the independent set produced by any application of the maxine heuristic , then @xmath36 .",
