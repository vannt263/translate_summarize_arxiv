    "the strong localization of few electrons in three dimensions is one of the key features of quantum dots @xcite ( qds ) .",
    "this results in a variety of properties making them potential candidates for new semiconductor applications such as laser and memory devices @xcite .",
    "one of those properties is the singular density of states , which relies on the alignment of the energy levels in the whole qd ensemble . on the one hand this requires a fairly homogeneous qd size distribution , on the other hand the statistical occupation of electronic qd levels @xcite changes the energy of levels of the same dot and all neighboring qds due to coulomb interaction .",
    "the amount of coulomb repulsion between qd electrons , especially at different qds , is expected to depend on the details of the complicated bulk charge distributions of the qd device .",
    "additionally , the microscopic charging and discharging processes of the qds depend on the energy differences between the qd levels and the non - equilibrium quasi - fermi level , resulting in a very complicated self - consistent problem .",
    "the microscopic charge distribution in the qd array is never stationary due to the statistical character of microscopic processes , but for large ensembles of qds or in a long time average a stationary mean qd sheet charge density is attained .",
    "standard approaches use quasi one - dimensional models where the charge in the qds is approximated by a homogeneous sheet charge @xcite .",
    "this is suitable to obtain the qd energy levels by a fit to experimental capacitance - voltage ( cv ) data @xcite , where a gaussian distribution of qd energy levels was assumed .",
    "nevertheless the interpretation of the fitted broadenings remains controversial , since they may result both from size fluctuations and inhomogeneous charging effects of the single qds .",
    "the model used in this work calculates self - consistently the charge distribution in an array of qds , with respect to the three - dimensional potential distribution under bias conditions . from an ensemble average of many qd",
    "charge configurations , the mean stationary qd sheet charge is calculated , to obtain macroscopic quantities like the depletion capacitance and the cv characteristics .",
    "the use of the electrostatic green s function method makes this expensive self - consistent problem solvable and charging effects in the qd array can be investigated separately from structural fluctuations .",
    "since only a small but essential part of the structure is not translationally invariant in the lateral ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) directions , but most of the device is inhomogeneous only in the growth direction ( @xmath2 ) the problem of solving the three - dimensional non - linear poisson s equation is divided up into calculating two one - dimensional potentials @xmath3 and @xmath4 and a suitable 3d green s function .",
    "the potential @xmath3 is introduced as the self - consistent solution of the non - linear one - dimensional poisson s equation @xmath5=-\\rho(\\phi , e_{\\text{fn}},e_{\\text{fp}})-\\sigma^{\\text{qd } } \\chi_{\\text{qd}}(z)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the current equations neglecting generation and recombination in the active region @xmath6=0\\\\ & \\partial_zj_p[\\phi , e_{\\text{fp}}]=0\\text { , } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the qd charge is treated as a sheet charge @xmath7 ( per unit area ) averaged over the lateral directions .",

    "the main drop of the capacitance with increasing reverse bias is due to the increasing bulk depletion region @xcite . on top of this background",
    "three peaks can clearly be observed for temperatures less than 150  k. the peak at @xmath80 - 2.2  v originates from the discharging of the excited states , which is split since piezoelectric fields break the degeneracy of the states ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ e0 ] ) . at @xmath80 - 3.6",
    "v the two ground state electrons are discharged successively leading to a double peak . here",
    ", the energy degeneracy is broken by the coulomb charging effects .",
    "the coulomb splitting has also been observed experimentally for different structures @xcite .",
    "the peak structure is broadened with rising temperature , resulting in a plateau in the cv characteristics at 300  k. our calculations use a charging energy of about 20  mev . from the ground state peak",
    "splitting in the 4  k curve of about 100  mv we can estimate a lever - arm factor of 200  mev / v which , when applied to the width of the ground state peaks , results in an energy broadening of 2.5  mev . this value coincides with the unscreened coulomb potential ( in units of energy ) of two electrons at a distance of 100  nm from a qd ( 2  @xmath81  1.25  mev ) .",
    "this means that the broadening at 4  k originates from the charge fluctuations within the four nearest neighbor qds , in particular if every second one is charged . at 300 k ,",
    "where occupation is rather insensitive to the qd level spacing , the full plateau width of about 500  mv corresponds to an energy broadening of 100  mev .",
    "this value can be attributed to the broadening in inas qds of the fermi distribution function of about @xmath82 @xmath83 at 300  k of the two ground state levels .",
    "consequently , at large temperatures , the charging energy is given by the averaged , statistically distributed charge stored in the qd array .",
    "this is the reason why the cv characteristics shows a flat plateau at 300  k and is hardly distinguishable from that of a quantum well @xcite .",
    "additionally , the ground state peaks show a shift to lower reverse bias for rising temperatures , where the excited states peaks do not show this feature . this shift can be explained as follows : when",
    "the ground states electrons are discharged , interdot charging energies become more important than for the excited states ( explained later in detail ) .",
    "the interdot interaction depends on how the free electrons can screen the interdot coulomb potential .",
    "this ability rises with lower temperatures leading to shorter screening lengths .",
    "therefore the charging energies are lower at low temperatures , and a higher reverse bias has to be applied to discharge the ground state electrons .",
    "now we investigate the impact of structural fluctuations of the qd ensemble such as position disorder and size fluctuations . at first",
    "we distribute the equally sized qds randomly instead of periodically in the lateral plane leaving the qd sheet density constant .",
    "compared to the characteristics without fluctuations ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ cv ] ) at 35  k and 70  k the ground state peaks for randomly distributed qds are only slightly smeared out ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ cv ] ) . since the electrons in the excited states can be thermally activated more easily due to fluctuations in the interdot coulomb interaction , resulting in an inhomogeneous charging of these levels ,",
    "the respective peaks are more strongly broadened .",
    "next we simulate an ensemble of periodically ordered qds with random qd diameters between 10 and 14  nm at 70  k , corresponding to a fluctuation of @xmath84 17  % . the resulting cv characteristic ( see dash - dotted line in fig .  [ cv ] ) shows a very broad ground state peak .",
    "again , the excited states are more sensitive to the fluctuations , i.e. , the respective peak disappears almost completely .",
    "the increase of the fluctuations of the diameter to @xmath8433  % ( 8 - 16  nm ) leads to a broad ground state plateau in the characteristics ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "such a plateau has been observed experimentally for similar pn structures @xcite , and a comparison with our results indicates that the size fluctuations in self - organized qds is of this order of magnitude .",
    "this size fluctuation corresponds to an energy fluctuation of the ground state of about 100  mev ( fig .",
    "[ e0 ] ) , which coincides with the typical value for the broadening of the ground state in the photoluminescence signal of inas qds @xcite . for room temperature the cv characteristics with @xmath8433",
    "% size fluctuation shows almost no deviation from the characteristics without fluctuations . here",

    "as already mentioned , the qds are discharged by applying a reverse bias . in fig .",
    "[ dens ] the mean number of electrons per qd is displayed as a function of bias for 35  k , 70  k and 300  k. at 35  k and 70  k the qds are charged with three electrons at zero bias and are discharged monotonically in a step - like manner at biases where peaks are observed in the cv characteristics ( solid lines ) .",
    "structural fluctuations lead to a broadening of these curves ( dashed , dash - dotted and dotted lines ) .",
    "additionally , with size fluctuations of @xmath8433  % some qds can store up to four electrons , leading to a higher average qd occupation . for 300  k the qds",

    "the residual ground state electrons are discharged .",
    "the continuous increase of the charging energies can be explained by considering the bulk electrons in the vicinity of the qds being depleted with reverse bias .",
