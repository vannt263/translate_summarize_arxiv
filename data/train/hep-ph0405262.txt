    "a wide variety of recent theoretical speculations , motivated in part by string - theory considerations , have raised the possibility that fundamentally new phenomena could occur at length scales below 1 mm .",

    "it has been suggested that the apparent inability of gravity to `` see '' the vacuum energy could be explained if the effective theory of gravity had a cutoff of @xmath22  mev@xcite , so that gravity would effectively `` shut off '' at length scales less than @xmath23 .",
    "experimental tests of the gravitational isl also probe certain speculations about _ non - gravitational _ physics .",
    "the standard model of particle physics can not be complete and many ideas for extending it predict very - low - mass scalar or vector bosons that could produce short - range exchange forces that would appear as violations of the isl ( see , for example , an extensive summary in ref .",

    "a surprisingly rich array of theoretical speculations suggests that fundamentally new physics could show up at length scales between 1 mm and 100 @xmath1 m .",
