    "however , as we noted in the derivation of ( [ m_inertia ] ) , this equivalence is nontrivial when @xmath197 because of the cancellation of contributions in going from ( [ m_inertia0 ] ) to ( [ m_inertia ] ) .",
    "we next consider the damping of the collective modes due to the collisions between atoms .",
    "since we are working in the collisionless regime @xmath198 , in ( [ eq_matrix2 ] ) , we can treat @xmath127 as a perturbation to @xmath121 .",
    "working to first order in @xmath125 , one has the following equation for normal mode frequencies : @xmath199 where @xmath200 is @xmath120 unit matrix and the function @xmath201 related to damping is found to be given by @xmath202 \\cr & & + ( \\tilde\\omega^2 - 2+\\delta_1)\\left\\{\\frac{2}{\\tilde\\tau_3 } [ \\tilde\\omega^2 - 2\\epsilon^2(1-\\delta_2/2)]+\\frac{1}{\\tilde\\tau_2 } [ \\tilde\\omega^2 - 2\\epsilon^2(1+\\delta_3)]\\right\\ } \\cr & & -2\\epsilon^2\\frac{\\delta_1\\delta_2}{\\tilde\\tau_3 } -2\\left[\\tilde\\omega^2 - 2\\epsilon^2(1+\\delta_3)\\right]\\frac{\\delta_2}{\\tilde\\tau_1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that the lowest order or first term in ( [ det2 ] ) can be written in terms of the undamped frequencies @xmath203 determined from ( [ eq_for_omega ] ) , namely @xmath204 we now look for the damping of these frequencies , i.e. , @xmath205 to first order in @xmath125 , we find the following expression for the damping rates : @xmath206    expanding the solution ( [ gamma ] ) in @xmath108 , one can obtain approximate expressions for the damping rate @xmath207 . the lowest - order approximation",
    "( neglecting @xmath208 and @xmath209 ) gives after some algebra @xmath210 we recall that within this approximation , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "one can show that damping for the condensate mode given in ( [ gamma_approx ] ) is precisely equivalent to that obtained by williams and griffin @xcite , where the dynamics of the noncondensate was neglected . to see this",
    ", we recall the ansatz ( [ ansatz_vc ] ) for @xmath211 and rewrite @xmath212 given in ( [ gamma_approx ] ) as [ see the definition of @xmath213 in ( [ tau1 ] ) ] @xmath214 ^ 2 } { \\displaystyle m\\int d{\\bf r}~n_{c0 } v_c^2}. \\label{gamma_c}\\ ] ] using the quantum hydrodynamic equations for the condensate in ( [ hydro_c ] ) ( neglecting @xmath215 and @xmath216 ) , one can write ( [ gamma_c ] ) in terms of the density fluctuations @xmath217 in the undamped solution .",

    "we have numerically evaluated ( [ gamma ] ) to find the damping of the collective modes . in fig .  4",

    "it turns out that the lowest - order formula for @xmath212 given in ( [ gamma_approx ] ) gives a good approximation for the full expression in ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "this means that the collisional damping of the condensate mode is almost entirely due to the @xmath0 collisional exchange with the static thermal cloud , as first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with little contribution from the @xmath63 collision term in ( [ pxy_coll ] ) .",
    "since the viscous relaxation only involves noncondensate fluctuations , they only affect the condensate motion through the hf mean field @xmath218 .",

    "in contrast , the damping of the @xmath149 modes is mainly due to the viscous relaxation associated with the @xmath103 relaxation time .",
    "the increase of @xmath219 as the temperature decreases near @xmath2 is due to the increase in the @xmath0 collision rate .",

    "the damping of the condensate mode we have found is much smaller than the magnitude observed in the oxford experiments @xcite .",
    "this is because the present moment analysis does not include landau damping of the condensate mode .",
    "landau damping is due to the mean - field coupling of the condensate oscillations to a continuum of noncondensate excitations @xcite . in our moment calculation",
    ", we truncate the hf mean field coupling using a simple ansatz for the noncondensate fluctuations , as given in ( [ ansatz_n ] ) .",
    "this simple form describes the coherent motion of the thermal cloud , but completely neglects the effect from incoherent single - particle excitations which are responsible for landau damping .",
    "recently , jackson and zaremba @xcite discussed the scissors mode at finite temperatures using a direct monte - carlo simulation of the zng semi - classical kinetic equation .",
    "they found that for the same parameters used in the present study , landau damping is the main contribution to the damping of the condensate mode at all temperatures ( see also ref .",

    "we also note that the numerical results in ref .",

    "this effect is not included in our moment calculation because of our simple ansatz for the noncondensate fluctuations , given in ( [ ansatz_n ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have used the zng kinetic theory @xcite to study the scissors mode in a trapped bose - condensed gas at finite temperatures .",
    "we derived three coupled moment equations starting from a generalized gp equation for the condensate and a semi - classical kinetic equation for the noncondensate .",
    "our coupled moment equations are the natural extension to finite temperatures of a similar calculation carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "we solved our coupled moment equations to find normal mode solutions .",
    "these solutions were used to calculate the quadrupole response function and the moment of inertia , using the exact frequency moment sum rule formulas derived by zambelli and stringari  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the moment of inertia is given by a simple expression in ( [ m_inertia ] ) , sum of the irrotational value of the condensate component and the rotational value of the noncondensate component .",
    "this result clearly shows that the linear response of an trapped bose gas at finite temperatures involves the irrotational motion of the condensate component as well as the rotational motion of the noncondensate component .",
    "we also evaluated the collisional damping for both the condensate and noncondensate oscillations .",
    "our analysis naturally led to three collision times : ( 1)@xmath98 is the relaxation time of the condensate due to @xmath0 collisions .",
    "( 2)@xmath99 is the relaxation time of the noncondensate due to @xmath0 collisions .",
    "( 3)@xmath103 is the relaxation time of the noncondensate similar to that involved in the shear viscosity transport coefficient @xcite , which has a contribution from both @xmath0 and @xmath63 collisions .",
    "we found that the noncondensate oscillations were damped mainly by a viscous - type relaxation ( @xmath223 ) , while the condensate damping was dominated by the collisional exchange due to @xmath0 collisions ( @xmath213 ) . if we neglect the dynamical mean - field coupling between the condensate and the noncondensate , one obtains an explicit expression for the condensate damping , which is identical to that given in ref .",
    "@xcite assuming a static noncondensate .",
    "we find that this simple static thermal cloud approximation provides a quantitatively good approximation for the @xmath0 collisional damping of the condensate mode .",
    "however , our present discussion does not explain the damping observed in the oxford experiments @xcite . as discussed in section v , this is because a truncated moment calculation such as ours can not easily deal with the mechanism of landau damping , which is the dominant contribution to the collective mode damping in the collisionless or mean - field regime @xcite . in order to incorporate landau damping in the moment method ,",
    "one will have to solve the exact set of moment equations ( [ xy_c ] ) - ( [ pxy_n ] ) including the incoherent motion of the thermal cloud .",
    "our simple ansatz in ( [ ansatz_n ] ) only describes the coherent thermal cloud dynamics .    in spite of the limitations mentioned above , the moment method developed in this paper",
    "is very useful in understanding the detailed dynamics of a trapped bose - condensed gas at finite temperatures .",
    "it provides an explicit physical picture of the coupled motions of the condensate and noncondensate components involved in the three scissors modes .",
    "our work was inspired by , and complements , the recent numerical work of jackson and zaremba @xcite on the scissors mode .",
    "our more analytical theory is essentially consistent with the results given in ref.@xcite , apart from missing the landau damping .",
