    "in 2002 , the analysis of @xmath5 decays performed by the e791 collaboration revealed that approximately 50% of these decays proceed through a low - mass scalar resonance with isospin @xmath6 : the @xmath7 , also called the @xmath8  @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the @xmath8 was the second elusive scalar to be firmly detected in @xmath9 decays since the scalar - isoscalar @xmath10 , or @xmath11 , had been detected by the same collaboration in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "more recently , the @xmath5 decay was revisited by e791  @xcite and two other experiments produced analyses based on larger data samples , namely focus  @xcite and cleo  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions of the pioneering e791 work have been confirmed in both cases .    in the past , many analyses of @xmath1 scattering data had already claimed the presence of the @xmath8 pole in the scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "the most precise and model independent determination of its position in the second riemann sheet was produced in ref .",

    "although the experimental results are sound and the @xmath8 pole is at present theoretically well known , a comprehensive and successful description of the reaction @xmath5 is still not available ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "experimentalists , for the want of a better framework , commonly fit their data with the isobar model which consists of a weighted sum of breit - wigner - like propagators .",
    "often , a complex constant is added to the amplitude in order to account for the non - resonant decays .",
    "it is known , nevertheless , that the adoption of breit - wigner functions to describe the effect of scalar resonances is problematic .",
    "some of the deficiencies of this approach are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where oller proposed the substitution of these functions in the @xmath2 wave by expressions based on unitarised chpt  @xcite .",
    "this model provides a good description of the data but , since the weak part of the decay was not tackled , the relative weight of the amplitudes remain arbitrary complex parameters to be determined from the fit .",
    "little progress has been achieved in the treatment of weak decays of charmed mesons since the seminal papers by bauer , stech and wirbel  @xcite .",
    "this fact stems from the mass of the @xmath15-quark that lies between the heavy and the light domains , rendering heavy - quark approaches or the use of chiral symmetry less trustworthy .",

    "they considered the contribution of two resonances , namely the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 . in the light of the present empirical data it is clear that this model can not provide a good description of the decay . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the decay is mainly driven by the @xmath16 whereas the analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite show that the decay is largely dominated by @xmath1 pairs in an @xmath2-wave state . on average ,",
    "the total scalar signal amounts to 82%  @xcite .",

    "factorisation is assumed for the weak amplitude and the @xmath18 scalar form factor , constrained by chiral dynamics and unitarity , provides the description of  fsis  @xcite . in refs .",

    "although the assumption of factorisation is less reliable for the @xmath15-quark mass scale , it has been successfully applied to @xmath24 decays in several recent papers  @xcite .",
    "however , one should consider the wilson coefficients as phenomenological parameters to compensate for the deficiencies of factorisation  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological values are close to the calculated ones  @xcite but have larger errors than in applications to @xmath25 decays .",
    "the weak amplitude thus obtained receives contributions from colour - allowed and colour - suppressed topologies . in the latter ,",
    "the @xmath1 form factors appear manifestly and the construction of the final state is straightforward .",
    "the colour - allowed topology is more involved but , assuming the decay to be mediated by resonances as suggested by the experimental results , the fsis in this case can also be written in terms of @xmath1 form factors  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our description the hadronic fsis are fully taken into account by the @xmath1 scalar and vector form factors .",
    "both form factors have received attention in recent years and are now well known in the energy regime relevant to @xmath5 decays .",
    "the scalar component was studied in a framework that incorporates all the known theoretical constraints in refs .",
    "analyticity , unitarity , chiral symmetry , the large-@xmath26 limit of qcd , and the coupling to @xmath27 and @xmath28 channels were taken into account .",
    "the results were subsequently updated and we employ in this work the state - of - the - art version given in ref .",

    "<S> we present a model for the decay @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the weak interaction part of this reaction is described using the effective weak hamiltonian in the factorisation approach . </S>",
    "<S> hadronic final state interactions are taken into account through the @xmath1 scalar and vector form factors fulfilling analyticity , unitarity and chiral symmetry constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the model has only two free parameters that are fixed from experimental branching ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the modulus and phase of the @xmath2 wave thus obtained agree nicely with experiment up to 1.55  gev . </S>",
    "<S> we perform monte carlo simulations to compare the predicted dalitz plot with experimental analyses . allowing for a global phase difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 waves of @xmath4 , the dalitz plot of the @xmath0 decay , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 invariant mass spectra and the total branching ratio due to @xmath2-wave interactions are well reproduced . </S>"
