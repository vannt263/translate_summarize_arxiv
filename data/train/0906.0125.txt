    "large - scale biological network data are increasingly becoming available due to advances in experimental biology .",
    "we analyze protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) networks , where proteins are modeled as network nodes and interactions amongst them as network edges .",
    "since it is the proteins that carry out almost all biological processes and they do so by interacting with other proteins , analyzing ppi network structure could lead to new knowledge about complex biological mechanisms and disease .",
    "additionally , we analyze network representations of protein structures , `` residue interaction graphs '' ( rigs ) , where residues are modeled as network nodes and inter - residue interactions as network edges ; an inter - residue interaction exists between residues that are in close spatial proximity .",
    "understanding rigs might provide deeper insights into protein structure , binding , and folding mechanisms , as well as into protein stability and function .    to understand these complex biological network data",
    ", one must be able to successfully reproduce them .",
    "finding an adequate network model that will generate networks that closely replicate the structure of real data is one of the first steps in this direction .",
    "thus , we focus on finding well - fitting network models for biological networks .",
    "the hope is that a good network model could provide insights into understanding of biological function , disease , and evolution .",
    "for example , the use of an adequate network model is vital for discovering network motifs , evolutionary conserved functional modules @xcite , since network motif discovery requires comparing real - world networks with randomized ones @xcite .",
    "a well - fitting network model could also be used to assign confidence levels to existing protein interactions , as well as to predict new interactions that were overlooked experimentally @xcite .",
    "additionally , it could guide biological experiments in a time- and cost - optimal way , thus minimizing the costs of interactome detection @xcite . since discovering ppi and other biological networks",
    "is in its infancy , it is expected that practical application of network models will increase and prove its value in the future .",
    "several network models have been proposed for biological networks . starting with erds - rnyi random graphs @xcite",
    ", various network models have been designed to match certain properties of real - world networks .",
    "early studies published largely incomplete yeast two - hybrid ppi data sets @xcite that were well modeled by scale - free networks @xcite . in a scale - free network",
    ", the distribution of degrees follows a power - law @xcite .",
    "modeling of the data by scale - free networks was based on the assumption that the degree distribution is one of the most important network parameters that a good network model should capture .",
    "however , networks of vastly different structures could have the same degree distributions @xcite .",
    "additionally , it has been argued that currently available ppi network data are samples of the full interactomes and thus the observed power - law degree distributions are artifacts of sampling properties of these networks @xcite . as new biological network data becomes available , we need to ensure that our models continue to fit the data well . in the light of new ppi network data ,",
    "several studies have started questioning the wellness of fit of scale - free models : an evidence has been presented that the structure of ppi networks is closer to geometric random graphs , that model spatial relationships between objects , than to scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "similarly , geometric random graph model has been identified as an optimal network model for rigs @xcite .",
    "a well - fitting network model should generate graphs that closely resemble the structure of real - world networks . to evaluate the fit of a model to the data , one needs to compare model networks with real - world networks .",
    "however , network comparisons are computationally infeasible due to np - completeness of the underlying subgraph isomorphism problem @xcite .",
    "therefore , large network comparisons rely on heuristics , commonly called `` network properties . ''",
    "these properties belong to two major classes : global and local .",
    "global properties include the degree distribution , average clustering coefficient , clustering spectrum , average diameter , and the spectrum of shortest path lengths .",
    "local properties include network motifs , small overrepresented subgraphs @xcite , and graphlets , small connected induced subgraphs of real - world networks ( figure [ fig : heur ] ( a ) ) @xcite .",
    "based on graphlets , two highly sensitive measures of network local structural similarities were designed : the relative graphlet frequency distance ( `` rgf - distance '' ) @xcite and graphlet - based generalization of the degree distribution , called graphlet degree distribution agreement ( `` gdd - agreement '' ) @xcite .",
    "the choice of a network property for evaluating the fit of a network model to the data is non - trivial , since different models might be identified as optimal with respect to different properties . in general , global properties",
    "might not be constraining enough to capture complex topological characteristics of biological networks .",
    "for example , two networks with exactly the same degree distributions can have completely different underlying topologies ( figure [ fig : heur ] ( b ) ) . on the other hand , local properties , rgf - distance and gdd - agreement ,",
    "impose a larger number of constraints , thus reducing degrees of freedom in which networks being compared can differ .",
    "the fit of model networks to real - world data can also be evaluated by using principal component analysis of the vector space whose coordinates are the statistics of network properties @xcite , as well as by counting the number of random walks of a given length in the network and feeding these counts into a probabilistic method @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      filkov _ et al .",
    "_ use seven network properties to describe a real - world network and compare it with model networks @xcite . in comparison",
    ", we use 34 properties , therefore decreasing the number of degrees of freedom in which networks being compared can vary . also , the methodology used by filkov _ et al . _",
    "is different than ours .",
    "first , they evaluate the fit of a model to the data by using principal component analysis of the vector space whose coordinates are the statistics of the seven network properties that they analyzed .",
    "second , they evaluate the fit of two scale - free network models to the data : sf and their new scale - free model of network growth via sequential attachment of linked node groups . in comparison",
    ", we use three network models that have very different network structure : er , sf , and geo .    middendorf _ et al .",
    "_ measure the topological structure of a network by counting the number of random walks of a given length @xcite and giving those counts as input into classifiers .",
    "random walks are different than graphlets in several ways .",
    "first , graphlets are induced and random walks are not .",
    "second , nodes and edges can be repeated in a random walk , while a graphlet consists of a unique set of nodes and edges .",
    "use two classifiers , svm @xcite and dt @xcite to discriminate different network models .",
    "that is , in each study , they use a single probabilistic method to predict the best fitting network model for a real - world network . in comparison ,",
    "in this study we use five different probabilistic methods , all supporting geo as the best - fitting model .",
    "we show that dt and svm are the least robust out of the five probabilistic methods that we analyzed ( see section `` robustness and validation '' and table 3 ) .",
    "moreover , the training set of middendorf _ et al .",
    "_ contains model networks of the size of the data only and thus it could be biased by the model properties that are enforced by the chosen network size . in comparison , we train our probabilistic models on random networks of different sizes ( see sections `` techniques '' and `` methods '' ) to allow for a possibility to predict the best fitting network model for any yet unseen real - world network , independent of its size .",
    "_ consider sf , er , and small - world networks and identify sf - based duplication - mutation models as the best - fitting models for biological networks .",
    "given that middendorf _",
    "_ did not consider geo in their studies , and given a low robustness of dt and svm that they used , their reported best fit of sf - based models to the data could be questioned .",
    "we further elaborate on the power of integration of different network properties as opposed to using individual ones to asses the fit of a network model to the data .",
    "we use our graphcrunch software package @xcite to evaluate the fit of er , geo , and sf models to all ppi networks described in data sets section .",
    "graphcrunch evaluates the fit of the models to the data with respect to seven local and global network properties .",
    "when we evaluate the fit of the data to the models with respect to each of the seven properties , we obtain inconclusive results , because each of the properties favors a different model .",
    "for example , as illustrated in figure [ fig : properties ] ( a ) , sf fits yh1 the best with respect to the degree distribution , but geo is the best - fitting network model with respect to the clustering spectrum ( figure [ fig : properties ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this demonstrates the need for a method that finds a consensus between models suggested by different network properties .",
    "we propose such a method in this study .",
    "since our method integrates a variety of network properties , it imposes a large number of constraints on the networks being compared and reduces the number of degrees of freedom in which they can differ , thus increasing the confidence in the fit of a network model .",
    "inclusion of additional network properties could further increase the confidence at the expense of an increased computational complexity .",
    "* ( a ) * * ( b ) * * ( c ) * * ( d ) *    although several studies proposed geo as a well - fitting null model for ppi networks @xcite , a recent study questioned this @xcite .",
    "note however , that this conclusion was based on analyzing only one eukaryotic and one prokaryotic ppi network @xcite , each from dip @xcite .",
    "thus , in the light of low quality and incompleteness of the data from large databases @xcite ( also see results section ) , no conclusions about the fit of geo should have been made .",
    "the authors argued that low - dimensional geometric random graphs might not be able to capture high abundance of dense graphlets and bipartite subgraphs observed in real - world networks , neglecting two obvious alternatives for reconciling the differences in the abundance of subgraphs in the data and in geo : ( 1 ) they based their conclusion on the observation that bipartite graphlet 20 can not exist in 2-dimensional ( 2d ) geo , even though it exists in 3d geo as well as in all higher dimensions ( figure [ fig : properties ] ( c ) ) ; and ( 2 ) geo graphs with the same number of nodes , but @xmath0 times more edges than the data have very similar abundance of all graphlets as the data ( figure [ fig : properties ] ( d ) ) .",
    "these observations are important since : ( 1 ) the optimal dimension for the space of ppi networks is unknown and finding it is a non - trivial research problem , but it is highly unlikely that ppi networks exist in a 2d space ; and ( 2 ) the density of real - world data will continue to increase @xcite , most likely in accordance with its network model . also note that over - abundance of graphlets in the currently available ppi networks could be an artefact of the `` matrix '' and `` spoke '' models used to determine ppis in affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry ( ap / ms ) pull - down experiments . in the matrix model , interactions are defined between all proteins in a purified complex , clearly resulting in over - abundance of dense graphlets . in the spoke model",
    ", interactions are defined between a bait and each of its preys , but not between the preys , clearly resulting in over - abundance of sparse graphlets ; an overlap between preys in different purifications results in over - abundance of complete bipartite graphs .    finally , it is possible that ppi networks are not completely geometric and that another random graph model would provide a better fit . additionally , it is possible that different parts of ppi networks have different structure .",
    "the two most commonly used high - throughput ppi detection methods , ap / ms and y2h , are fundamentally different : ap / ms detects mostly stable protein complexes , whereas y2h detects mostly transient signalling interactions @xcite .",
    "thus , the two methods examine different , complementary subspaces within the interactome , resulting in networks with different topological and biological properties @xcite . since proteins within a protein complex are close in the cell , it is possible that protein complexes have a geometric structure .",
    "in contrast , transient interactions in signalling pathways might have a different structure , such as that of bipartite graphs or scale - free networks .",
    "we present an integrative approach for identifying the best - fitting network model for rigs and ppi networks .",
    "we use five probabilistic methods to evaluate the fit of a network model to a real - world network with respect to a series of network properties .",
    "all five probabilistic methods confirm that geo is the best - fitting model for rigs .",
    "ppi data sets of high confidence and coverage are also fitted the best by geo , while sparser and lower - confidence ppi networks are fitted the best by sf or er . by testing the robustness of probabilistic methods to noise ,",
    "we demonstrate that our approach is unlikely to predict a real - world network as geo if it had a noisy sf structure , independent of the probabilistic method or noise level . on the other hand",
    ", it could classify a real - world network as sf or er if it had a noisy geo structure , depending on the probabilistic method and noise level .",
    "together , these results suggest that the structure of ppi networks is the most consistent with the structure of noisy geo . since networks have been used to model real - world phenomena in various domains , it would be interesting to apply our method to other types of real - world networks , such as technological or social ones .",
    "we summarize the structure of a complex network by the notion of the `` network fingerprint '' ( of just `` fingerprint , '' for brevity ) .",
    "we define the _ fingerprint _ to be a 34-dimensional vector whose coordinates contain the following network properties : the average degree , average clustering coefficient , average diameter , and frequencies of the appearance of all 31 1 - 5-node graphlets .",
    "the _ degree _ of a node is the number of edges incident to the node ; the _ average degree _ of a network is the average of degrees over all nodes in the network .",
    "the _ clustering coefficient _ of a node is defined as the probability that two neighbors of the node are themselves connected .",
    "the average of clustering coefficients over all nodes in a network is the _ average clustering coefficient _ of the network .",
    "the smallest number of links that have to be traversed in a network to get from one node to another is called the _ distance _ between the two nodes and a path through the network that achieves this distance is called the _ shortest path _ between the nodes ; the average of shortest path lengths over all pairs of nodes in a network is called the _ average network diameter_. _ graphlets _ are small connected non - isomorphic induced subgraphs of a large network @xcite ; we count the occurrences of the only 1-node graphlet , a node , the only 2-node graphlet , an edge , and all 29 3 - 5-node graphlets ( shown in figure 1(a ) ) . because different coordinates of a network fingerprint can differ by several orders of magnitude , we normalize each coordinate to avoid domination of coordinates having large values .",
    "we normalize the @xmath1 coordinate @xmath2 of the network fingerprint _ x _ as @xmath3 , for @xmath4 ; we add 1 to @xmath5 to avoid the logarithm function to go to infinity when @xmath6 .",
    "we consider three random network models : erds - rnyi ( er ) random graphs @xcite , scale - free barabsi - albert ( sf ) networks @xcite , and geometric ( geo ) random graphs @xcite . in",
    "_ erds - rnyi random graphs _",
    ", edges between pairs of nodes are distributed uniformly at random with the same probability @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "_ scale - free networks _",
    "are networks that have power - law degree distributions .",
    "the version of sf networks that we use are generated by barabsi - albert peripheral attachment method @xcite , in which newly added nodes preferentially attach to existing nodes with probabilities proportional to their degrees . in _ geometric random graphs _ , nodes correspond to uniformly distributed points in a metric space and edges are created between pairs of nodes if the corresponding points are close enough in the metric space according to some distance norm @xcite .",
    "we construct geometric random graphs by using 3-dimensional euclidean boxes and the euclidean distance norm @xcite .    for each of the three random network models , we generate 10 instances of random networks per model .",
    "we generate random networks of different sizes , both in terms of the number of nodes ( @xmath8 ) and the number of edges ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we use the following @xmath10 values for @xmath8 : 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 , 800 , 900 , 1,000 , 1,100 , 1,200 , 1,300 , 1,400 , 1,600 , 2,100 , 2,600 , 3,100 , 3,600 , 4,100 , 4,600 , 5,000 , 6,000 , 7,000 , 8,000 , 9,000 , 10,000 , and 11,000 . for each of the @xmath11 values of @xmath8 below 10,000 ,",
    "we vary @xmath12 from 1 to 10 , in increments of 1 . due to the increase in computational complexity with the increase in the number of nodes and edges , for the @xmath13 largest values of @xmath8 , @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    ", we only use @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we analyze @xmath17 different network sizes . in total , for the 3 network models , 10 random network instances per model , and 274 network sizes , we create @xmath18 model networks .",
    "we use five well - known probabilistic methods : backpropagation method ( bp ) , probabilistic neural networks ( pnn ) , decision tree ( dt ) , multinomial nave bayes classifier ( mnb ) , and support vector machine ( svm ) .",
    "both * bp * @xcite and * pnn * @xcite are based on artificial neural networks ( anns ) .",
    "anns are simplified mathematical models of biological nervous systems built of processing units called neurons .",
    "neurons in anns have many input signals and they produce one output signal .",
    "they are organized into the following layers : the input layer , one or more hidden layers , and the output layer .",
    "neurons in the input layer do not perform any processing ; instead , they only distribute the input data to all neurons in the first hidden layer .",
    "the number of hidden layers depends on implementation of an ann .",
    "we use the standard implementations of bp and pnn from neural - network toolbox in matlab . for the completeness of the manuscript ,",
    "we briefly outline them below .    in our implementation of * bp *",
    "@xcite , the input layer consists of 34 neurons corresponding to the 34 coordinates of the network fingerprint input vector . to match the length of our input vector , we implement one hidden layer with 15 neurons ;",
    "varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer between 10 and 20 had marginal effect on the results .",
    "the output layer contains three neurons , according to the `` 1-of - n encoding of the output classes '' principle @xcite : the number of neurons in the output layer matches the number of possible `` output classes , '' i.e. , random network models ( er , sf , and geo ) .",
    "thus , for a given output class , the neuron corresponding to the class is set to 1 , whereas the remaining two neurons are set to -1 .",
    "after bp computes the values on the three output neurons for an input vector , it classifies the input into an output class that corresponds to the neuron with the largest value .",
    "all neurons in the input layer are connected with all neurons in the hidden layer .",
    "similarly , all neurons in the hidden layer are connected with all neurons in the output layer .",
    "all of these connections are weighted .",
    "each neuron in the hidden and the output layer produces output by applying a non - linear `` transfer function '' to calculate a weighted sum of its inputs .",
    "we use _ logsig _ and _ tansig _ transfer functions in the hidden layer and the output layer , respectively .",
    "initially , all weights are assigned randomly .",
    "weights are adjusted gradually trough a training ( learning ) process : bp keeps adjusting the weights until the error between the value of each output neuron and its desired value ( i.e. , the value of the class that the input that we are training bp on belongs to ) is @xmath19 .",
    "we use _ trainscg _ `` training function '' and set the learning rate to 0.01 . given these parameters , bp is successfully trained on the training set ( defined in techniques section above ) in 588 epochs .    * pnn * that we use consists of the radial basis layer and the competitive layer .",
    "the radial basis layer further consists of the input and pattern sublayers .",
    "similarly , the competitive layer consists of the summation and the output sublayers .",
    "the number of neurons in the input sublayer corresponds to the 34 dimensions of the input vector .",
    "the pattern sublayer consists of three pools of `` pattern '' neurons , where each pool corresponds to one of the three output classes .",
    "the number of neurons in each pool is determined as follows . as each network fingerprint from the training set",
    "is provided as input vector into pnn during the training process , a new neuron is added to the pool that corresponds to the output class ( i.e. , network model ) of the input vector .",
    "after the training phase , when an input vector is presented to the trained pnn , the pattern sublayer computes how close the input vector is to each of the vectors from the training set in each pool .",
    "this information is sent to the summation sublayer .",
    "the summation sublayer consists of three neurons , where each neuron corresponds to one of the three output classes .",
    "input into each neuron in the summation sublayer is the collection of outputs from the corresponding pool in the pattern sublayer .",
    "the output of each summation sublayer neuron is a weighted sum of all its inputs .",
    "each of the three sums represents the probability that the input vector belongs to the corresponding class .",
    "given these probabilities , the output sublayer , consisting of a single neuron , outputs the class having the highest probability .",
    "we use a standard implementation of * dt * @xcite from statistics toolbox in matlab .",
    "interior nodes in the decision tree are queries on certain attributes ; in our case , attributes are the coordinates of the fingerprint vector .",
    "each leaf in the tree corresponds to one of the three output classes .",
    "branches in the tree represent conjunctions of attributes that lead to classification into the output classes .",
    "dt recursively splits the training set of input vectors into subsets based on the values of their coordinates ; this corresponds to branching in the tree .",
    "dt continues to do so until the training input vectors are assigned to their correct classes .",
    "we use a standard implementation of * mnb * @xcite from weka @xcite , a publicly available collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining .",
    "mnb classifies the input data based on the bayes rule by selecting a class that maximizes the posterior probability of the class , given the training set .",
    "mnb does not use the assumption of a nave bayes classifier , that all data attributes are independent of each other .",
    "we use a standard implementation of * svm * @xcite from weka .",
    "svm maps our 34-dimensional input vectors into a high dimensional space ; the space dimension is automatically determined by weka . during the training phase",
    ", svm finds an optimized data division within this space by constructing a hyperplane that optimally separates the data into two classes ; since there are many hyperplanes that might classify the data , the hyperplane is chosen so that the distance from the hyperplane to the nearest data point is maximized .",
    "we generalize this binary classification to the multiclass classification , with three classes corresponding to the three random network models .",
    "we do so by using three binary `` one - versus - all '' svms : for each of the three classes , its corresponding svm either classifies the input data as belonging to the class ( `` positive classification '' ) , or not belonging to the class ( `` negative classification '' ) @xcite . each of these three binary svms produces an output function that gives a relatively large value for a positive classification and a relatively small value for a negative classification .",
    "the input data is classified into the class with the highest value of the output function .",
