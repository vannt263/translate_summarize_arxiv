    "strained self - assembled inas / gaas quantum dots grown on subsequent layers stack spontaneously one above the other@xcite forming artificial molecules with spatially extended states due to the tunnel interdot coupling .",
    "the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum of the coupled dots consists of a number of lines which are blue or red shifted by the coupling @xcite depending on the way the single - particle electron and hole wave functions contribute to the exciton states in question.@xcite application of an electric field oriented along the growth direction offers the possibility of external control of the strength of the tunnel coupling .",
    "recent experimental results@xcite on the stark effect for vertically coupled pairs of nonidentical dots showed the effect of tunnel coupling through the appearance of avoided crossings between states localized in different dots .",
    "previously , tunnel - coupling related stark shift of the electroabsorption spectra has been observed in vertical stacks of several quantum dots.@xcite    stark effect on the exciton states in vertically coupled self - assembled quantum dots has previously been studied in refs .",
    "[ @xcite ] and [ @xcite ] .",
    "an anomaly in the ground - state stark shift was found@xcite by the @xmath0 method accounting for the strain effects and realistic shapes of the dots .",
    "this anomaly consists in deviation of the ground - state energy line from the usual quadratic dependence@xcite on the external field @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the electric field for which the overlap of the electron and the hole wave functions is the largest and for which the recombination energy is maximal , @xmath3 is the dipole moment and @xmath4  the polarizability .",
    "the shift calculated@xcite for coupled dots can only be approximated with two parabolas : one for @xmath5 and the other for @xmath6 , amounting in a cusp at @xmath2 .",
    "although this deviation was attributed@xcite to the strain distribution it was shown that such a behaviour can also be obtained in a single band model of coupled quantum disks neglecting the strain .",
    "@xcite actually , as we discuss below analyzing the stark shift of the first excited state , this deviation is due to a near degeneracy of the ground - state around @xmath2 resulting from the weakness of the hole tunnel coupling . in the present paper we report on another deviation of the stark shift from quadratic form related to the exciton dissociation via a ground - state anticrossing of a bright state with both carriers in the same dot and a dark state with separated carriers .",
    "quantitative modelling@xcite of single quantum dots requires taking into account the valence band mixing , the gradient in the indium distribution , strain effects , and confinement geometry which are very different for quantum dots fabricated at various laboratories . in this paper",
    "we present a qualitative study of the effects of the external electric field on the _ interdot _ tunnel coupling visible in the stark shifts of the bright energy levels , which should be universal for various types of coupled dots .",
    "in particular we focus on the effect of the electron - hole interaction which was neglected@xcite or treated in an approximate manner@xcite in previous work . for a single quantum dot the coulomb interaction may have a small effect on the stark shift since the interaction energy only weakly changes with the small displacement of the electron and hole wave functions inside a single dot . on the other hand",
    "the role of the interaction for the stark effect in coupled dots is essential since the effect of the external field on the exciton consists in breaking the electron - hole binding and segregation of carriers into different dots .    in the present work we use a simple model potential@xcite with a square quantum well for the vertical confinement and parabolic lateral confinement adopting the single band approximation for the hole . due to the applied idealizations",
    "the model is exactly solvable .",
    "our results fully account for the interparticle correlations due to the coulomb interaction and cover also the excited states .",
    "a recent experiment@xcite on the stark effect in a vertically coupled system of quantum dots was performed on a charge tunable structure , similar to the one used in studies of negatively charged excitons.@xcite a spectacular change in the spectrum was observed,@xcite when an electron was trapped in the dot closer to the electron reservoir .",
    "namely , a sudden drop of the recombination energy and an unexplained positive curvature of the recombination line as a function of the electric field was observed.@xcite this observation motivated us to look at the stark effect for the negatively charged trion .",
    "for the negative trion we apply the approximation that the lateral degrees of freedom are frozen . the validity of this approximation is first verified for the stark shift of the exciton energy levels . in nanostructures the trion binding energies with respect to the dissociation into an exciton and a free electron are considerably increased.@xcite however , the trion binding energy is usually substantially smaller than the exciton binding energy .",
    "we report here that for a symmetric system of vertically coupled quantum dots the trion is _ more _",
    "stable for dissociation by the external electric field than the exciton .",
    "the study of the dissociation mechanism shows , that for the pair of identical dots the trion is dissociated into a pair of electrons confined in one dot and a hole in the other . only for the asymmetric system of coupled dots a dissociation into an exciton and a free electron",
    "is obtained as an intermediate step before the final separation of the hole from the two electrons . in this case , the trion is more easily dissociated than the exciton .",
    "the positive curvature of the recombination energy as a function of the electric field is obtained for the trion ionization process into an exciton and a free electron .",
    "previously , trions in vertically coupled dots were studied in the absence of the external field@xcite and neglecting tunnel coupling between the dots.@xcite    this papers is organized as follows , the next section contains the description of the theoretical approach , the results are given in section iii , their discussion is presented in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to the summary and conclusions .",
    "we assume a parabolic lateral confinement potential with equal electron and hole confinement energy ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "vertical confinement for the electron ( @xmath8 ) and the hole ( @xmath9 ) is taken as double well potentials of depth @xmath10 for the electron and @xmath11 for the hole and of width @xmath12 nm separated by a barrier of thickness @xmath13 .",
    "isolated quantum dots may possess a built - in strain - induced electric field pushing the hole to the top of the dot as found in the photocurrent measurements of the stark effect on buried quantum dots .",
    "@xcite however , in coupled quantum dots the built - in electric field has the opposite orientation.@xcite therefore , this intrinsic electric field is neglected in the present calculations ( in fact , such a build in electric field can also be interpreted as a shift of our applied field ) . for self - assembled quantum dots",
    "the assumption of harmonic lateral confinement is not valid , however it should not essentially modify the susceptibility of the carriers to the electric field oriented vertically .    in the present model the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the position vectors of electron and the hole , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the electron hole distance , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the electron ( hole ) effective band mass , @xmath21 is the dielectric constant , and @xmath22 is the potential of the external electric field taken as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the value of the electric field assumed to be uniform between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( which can be identified as the positions of the electrodes ) . in the calculations we leave a space of 10 nm between the dots and the points @xmath25 and @xmath26 beyond which the electric field is assumed to be zero .",
    "the model of the coupled quantum dots used in this paper was previously applied@xcite to describe the exciton coupling between dots in the absence of an external electric field .",
    "the authors@xcite used the configuration interaction scheme to account for the lateral correlations between the electron and the hole .",
    "the configuration interaction approach for the electron - hole systems is computationally much more challenging than for the electron systems due to its slow convergence.@xcite therefore , in this paper we will make explicit use of the lateral separability of the center of mass .",
    "after introduction of the lateral relative @xmath27 and lateral center - of - mass @xmath28 coordinates , the hamiltonian can be expresses as a sum of the lateral center - of - mass hamiltonian ( @xmath29 ) and the hamiltonian for the relative lateral and the single - particle vertical motion ( @xmath30 ) , which are given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 stands for the laplacian in the @xmath36 plane .",

    "the spectrum with @xmath44-symmetry center - of - mass excitations is simply a replica of the spectrum corresponding to the ground state of the center of mass shifted by the energy @xmath45 .",
    "the recombination probabilities for the states corresponding to zero angular momentum center - of - mass excitations are _ exactly _ equal to the corresponding states with the ground - state center of mass , since integrals of all the @xmath44 type wave functions of a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator are equal , which is due to a property of laguerre polynomials .",
    "for potentials , in which the parity is a good quantum number , i.e. for identical quantum dots without an external field , we consider only states of even parity , the odd parity states being dark .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath38 of hamiltonian ( [ rel ] ) are calculated on a three - dimensional finite - difference mesh with the imaginary time technique.@xcite we use the material parameters for an @xmath46 quantum dot embedded in a gaas matrix with a uniform concentration of indium in the quantum dot @xmath47.@xcite we take the following parameters for the alloyed quantum dot material @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the free electron mass , @xmath52 ev , @xmath53 ev , and we take for the lateral confinement @xmath54 mev .",

    "for the assumed center - of - mass separation the hole is therefore more strongly localized than the electron by a factor of @xmath60 . in inas",
    "/ gaas quantum dots the hole confinement is stronger than the electron confinement which is due to the finite quantum well effect@xcite and the electron - hole interaction which localizes the heavy hole much more strongly than the light electron . in fig .",
    "7 we show that a change in the strength of the hole and electron lateral confinement does not influence the qualitative features of the spectra in an external electric field .",
    "it merely leads to shifts of the energy levels along the energy axis .    for the negative trion in quantum dots with a rectangular - well confinement the effect of",
    "a stronger hole localization leads to a larger electron - hole interaction energy than the electron - electron interaction energy.@xcite this produces a red - shift of the negative trion recombination line which increases with decreasing size of the dot and consequently leads to a decrease of the red - shift due to the tunnel effect in coupled quantum dots.@xcite in two - dimensional quantum wells the experimentally observed@xcite positive and trion recombination energies for zero - magnetic field are nearly equal , although in strictly@xcite two - dimensional confinement significantly lower recombination energy for the positive trion was predicted .",
    "this effect is explained@xcite by stronger hole localization .",
    "therefore , the adopted confinement potential takes into account the electron - hole interaction enhancement@xcite with respect to the electron - electron interaction .",

    "the @xmath66 level increases when the electric field is switched on . on the other hand the @xmath67 energy level decreases with field .",

    "the confinement potential of vertically stacked dots usually exhibits asymmetry , which even for identical dots can be induced by the strain effects.@xcite let us consider the effect of the asymmetry of the confinement potential on the exciton spectrum .",
    "it was established@xcite that for stacked strained truncated pyramids the ground state of the hole is completely localized in one of the dots , while the electron ( noninteracting@xcite with the hole ) still forms bonding and antibonding states .    here",

    "two bright energy levels around -563 mev and -560 mev are obtained . in the lower ( upper ) of energy levels both",
    "the carriers are localized in the deeper ( shallower ) of the dots .",
    "the lowest dark energy level decreasing linearly in energy with @xmath24 has the hole localized in the right dot [ cf .",
    "5(a ) ] so it crosses the higher bright energy level with both the carriers in the left dot .",

    "4(b ) shows the spectrum for this case .",
    "surprisingly the spectrum for the electron confinement asymmetry is just shifted by + 2.5 kv / cm with respect to the spectrum for the hole confinement asymmetry [ cf .",

    "the crossing / anticrossing mechanism is the same as for the hole confinement asymmetry .    for smaller barrier thickness",
    "the anticrossings of the dark and bright energy levels become wider and as a consequence the region near @xmath41 in which the two lowest energy levels are nearly independent of @xmath24 is narrower .",

    "the two parallel energy levels near @xmath41 observed for weak tunnel coupling in fig .",
    "4 are now ( see fig .",
    "6 ) converted into a crossing at a small negative @xmath24 .",
    "this feature results in the cusp of the ground - state energy reported previously@xcite for a thin ( 1.8 nm ) interdot barrier .",
    "for the electron asymmetry the spectra are still shifted to higher values of the field by about 2.5 kv / cm with respect to the hole asymmetry , like in the weak coupling case of fig .",
    "4 . the crossing of the bright energy levels still appears at @xmath81 .",
    "the reason of this similarity is that in the ground state at @xmath41 the dipole moment induced by the electron and hole asymmetry is the same in sign and not very different in size . for small @xmath13 the electron charge",
    "is smeared over _ both _ dots .",
    "if the right dot is deeper for the electron it binds a _ larger _",
    "part of its charge .",
    "consequently , the _ entire _ charge of the hole is pulled to the right dot . on the other hand , for the hole confinement asymmetry",
    "the dot which is deeper for the hole localizes its charge completely even for small @xmath13 since the hole tunnel coupling is negligible .",
    "the localization of the hole in the right dot results in a larger localization of the electron in the right dot . in this way",
    "the asymmetry of the confinement for one particle is translated into an asymmetry of the potential felt by the other particle via the coulomb interaction .",
    "although it is possible experimentally to determine which of the dots is deeper by looking at the electric - field dependence of the bright energy levels one can not deduce from the @xmath24-dependence of the exciton energy levels alone which of the carriers is responsible for the asymmetry .",
    "the exact separability of the center of mass used in the previous calculations was possible because of the assumption of identical lateral confinement energies for the electron and the hole .",
    "when the center of mass is not separable@xcite the exact calculations become much more complex . however , as long as the interest of calculations relies in a qualitative description of the influence of the electric field applied in the growth direction the actual form of the lateral confinement is not essential . in this case",
    "one may try to integrate out the lateral degrees of freedom.@xcite such an adiabatic approximation is valid for strong lateral confinement , as in the case of self - assembled quantum dots .",
    "thus we assume that the electron and hole lateral wave functions can be identified with the ground - state of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "this assumption allows us to integrate@xcite over the lateral degrees of freedom and arrive at the effective hamiltonian for the vertical motion @xmath84 with @xmath85 the effective potential@xcite of one - dimensional interaction given by @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "the solution to the eigenequation of the effective hamiltonian ( [ hef ] ) describes the effects appearing in the growth direction at the expense of a simplified picture of the lateral motion .",
    "4 shows the comparison of the exact results ( solid lines ) obtained with the separated center - of - mass and approximate results calculated for frozen lateral degrees of freedom ( dashed lines ) for identical quantum dots separated by a barrier of thickness @xmath74 nm , as considered above in fig .",
    "the approximate method reproduces the correct qualitative shape of the energy lines .",
    "also the recombination probability dependence on the electric field does not significantly differ .",
    "however , the approximation of the frozen lateral state eliminates the lateral excitations .",
    "the avoided crossings of the bright energy levels with the dark energy levels with lateral excitations are therefore overlooked in the present approximation [ cf .",

    "the accuracy of the approximate method is better for dark states with separated charge carriers than for the bright energy levels for which the electrons and hole wave function overlap .",
    "@xcite the discussed approximation can be applied to evaluate the qualitative dependence of the bright energy levels on the external field when lateral excitations are absent . in the following section we will use this approach to study the effect of the external field on the negatively charged trion in coupled dots .",
    "the dotted lines in fig . 7 show the results of frozen - degree - of - freedom calculations performed for the electron confinement unchanged but weakened hole confinement for which the lateral confinement radii of the electron and the hole are equal .",
    "for weakened hole confinement the electron - hole interaction energy is smaller , which leads to a blue - shift of the energy levels for @xmath41 with respect to the equal confinement energies case ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "the interaction energy of the dissociated electron - hole pair is less strongly affected by the change of the hole localization strengths .",
    "7 shows that the electric - field dependence on the electric field is essentially not altered by the strength of the hole localization , which justifies _ a posteriori _ the assumption of the adopted center - of - mass separability .",

    "the leakage of particles to the other dot seen in fig .",

    "when the hole is transferred to the right dot ( cf . the plots for @xmath98 kv / cm ) , part of the electron charge follows it , which results in a local minimum of the electron charge accumulated in the left dot for @xmath24 around 13 kv / cm [ cf .",

    "[ trionx ] ( a ) ] .",

    "note , that the observed mechanism of dissociation of the trion into an exciton and an electron does not occur in the system of symmetric quantum dots ( cf .",
    "[ trion1 ] ) . for asymmetric quantum dots",
    "the stronger confinement energy in the thinner of the dots prevents the second electron from entering it simultaneously with the first one . in the asymmetric system",

    "the recombination energy lines of the trion in the asymmetric system of coupled dots present a positive second derivative with respect to the electric field for a certain range of @xmath24 .",
    "namely , for @xmath80 nm the second derivative is positive for the electric field range @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 kv / cm for @xmath80 , 8 and 10 nm , respectively .    for symmetric dots the mechanism behind the trion dissociation into an electron pair confined in one dot and the hole in the other , without an intermediate step consisting of an exciton in one dot , and the electron occupying the other quantum dot ,",
    "is easily explained when considering large @xmath13 using a simple reasoning in which the tunnel effect and the interdot coulomb interactions are neglected . in this model",
    "the dependence of the energy of the trion on the external field can be written as @xmath108 , where @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) is the absolute value of the electron - hole interaction for the particles localized in the same dot .",
    "the trion is localized in the dot in which the electron localization is favored by the field . the lowest energy level corresponding to the exciton confined in one dot and the electron in the other is @xmath111 , and the energy level corresponding to a completely dissociated system is @xmath112 . for @xmath41",
    "the trion is bound for @xmath113 and the ground state energy equals either @xmath114 or @xmath115 .",
    "the energy splitting of @xmath114 and @xmath116 is not affected by the field which explains the absence of an exciton as an intermediate step of trion ionization .",
    "a similar simple reasoning can be used for coupled asymmetric dots where the intermediate step of trion dissociation is now found .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction previous ground - state calculations@xcite for the stark effect in vertically coupled dots detected a deviation of the energy dependence on the electric field from the expected quadratic form obtained within the second order perturbation theory.@xcite the inset to fig .",
    "1(a ) shows that for identical quantum dots this deviation , i.e. , a cusp of the recombination energy in function of the electric field , is due to a narrow avoided crossing of two lowest energy levels . in the absence of the electric field these two energy levels",
    "are nearly degenerate .",
    "this near degeneracy results from the smallness of the hole tunnel coupling between the dots . for the case presented in fig .",
    "1(a ) these two energy levels correspond to opposite parity of the hole [ cf .",
    "2(a ) for @xmath41 ] .",
    "the electric field easily mixes the two energy levels localizing the hole in the right dot ( in the ground state ) and in the left quantum dot ( in the first excited state ) . when the confinement potential is asymmetric the discussed anticrossing of the two lowest energy levels are replaced by a crossing ( cf .",
    "this is due to a nearly complete localization of the hole in left or right quantum dot in the two states .",
    "the cusp of the ground - state is produced by _ two _ energy levels crossing or nearly crossing .",
    "it is therefore clear that second order perturbation theory for a single _ nondegenerate _ energy level given@xcite for a _ single _ quantum dot is not applicable to the ground - state in coupled quantum dots .",
    "there is therefore no reason for which the ground - state should follow the quadratic formula and the deviation from parabolicity does not really deserve to be called an anomaly .    in the present paper",
    "we have found another deviation from the common quadratic stark shift , also involving two energy levels .",
    "this deviation appears for an intermediate barrier thickness and is due to an avoided crossings of a bright energy level with both carriers in the same dot and a dark energy with separated charge carriers .",
    "this unusual stark effect , shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) for a symmetric dot , should be visible in low - excitation pl spectroscopy.@xcite the observation of the excited exciton states should be facilitated by a relatively weak tunnel coupling between the quantum dots . in the corresponding pl spectrum , one of the lines should be independent of the electric field in both energy and intensity . the additional structure below and above the constant - energy line should be observed in the form of an anticrossing .",
    "the intensity of the constant - energy line should be reduced in the region , in which the anticrossing appears .",
    "real inas / gaas quantum dots exhibit a strain - induced intrinsic dipole moment at @xmath41.@xcite the intrinsic dipole moment has been neglected in the present calculations .",
    "however , the unusual stark shift for the coupled dots is predicted for quite small electric fields ( lower than 15 kv / cm ) , for which the effect of the intrinsic dipole moment is negligible . for comparison in the experiment",
    "the intrinsic dipole moment leads to a shift of the transition energy by about 5 mev for @xmath118 kv / cm.@xcite therefore , the intrinsic dipole moment should not modify the qualitative features of the effect predicted in the present paper .",
    "the second order effect of the polarizability related to the electric - field induced deformation of the electron and hole wave function for the discussed low electric field range should be even smaller .",
    "similar mechanism of the exciton dissociation via an avoided crossing has been found for asymmetric dots [ cf .",
    "5(a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "the difference between the ideally symmetric system and the more realistic asymmetric one is that the bright state which does not participate in the avoided crossing is shifted to a different energy , lower or higher depending on the direction of the electric field .",
    "the mechanism of the exciton dissociation via an avoided crossing of a dark and a bright energy level described here has been recently confirmed experimentally@xcite after the present paper has been submitted .",
    "second - order perturbation theory for a single nondegenerate energy level@xcite predicts a nonpositive curvature of the energy level as a function of the electric field . although the curvature is indeed nonpositive in the ground - state , a positive curvature is obtained for the excited bright energy levels in the presence of the avoided crossings with lower energy levels [ see figs .",
    "4(a - c ) , 9 and 11 ] .",
    "a non - degenerate perturbation theory for a single level@xcite obviously does not apply for the the energy level interaction .    in view of the present results",
    "the pronounced drop of the recombination energy for a bias voltage for which an electron is trapped in the quantum dot@xcite closer to the electron reservoir can be understood provided that the recombination signal in the observed range of wavelengths comes from this dot .",
    "otherwise , the charge of the electron trapped in the dot closer to the reservoir would have a negligible influence on the energy of exciton recombination in the other dot separated by a barrier of 12 nm [ cf .",
    "the small energy spacing between the exciton recombination lines with and without a spectator electron in the other dot for @xmath78 nm in fig .",
    "10(a ) ] . the drop would result from the electrostatics of the negative trion in which the energy of the electron - hole attraction is larger than the electron - electron repulsion due to a difference of the strength of lateral localization of the carriers ( see the discussion given in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] ) . the observed growth of the recombination energy for the smaller absolute value of the bias voltage could be related to a passage of one of the electrons to the upper dot .",
    "the presented calculations for the trion were limited to the ground - state . however , the pl line observed in the experiment which we here attribute to the trion recombination in the _ lower _ of the dots does not correspond to the ground state since the quantum dot in the upper layer are _",
    "larger_. therefore , in the experiment the dissociation of the trion localized in the lower dot could be associated with an avoided crossings with lower energy states , which as obtained for the exciton , can produce a positive curvature of the recombination line over a wide range of electric field values .",
    "we have studied the exciton and negative trion states in a simple but exactly solvable model of vertically coupled quantum dots allowing for a description of the effects related to the modification of the electron - hole interaction by an electric field applied in the growth direction . the effect of the tunnel coupling between the dots and the confinement potential asymmetry was considered .",
    "the mechanism of the electric - field induced exciton and trion dissociation was described .",
    "we have shown that the previously@xcite found deviations from the quadratic stark effect are due to energy levels crossings ( or very narrow avoided crossings ) . for weaker tunnel coupling",
    "we have found another non - quadratic feature due to an avoided crossing of bright and dark energy levels .",
    "this feature appears also in the presence of the asymmetry of the coupled dots and is due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "positive curvature of the bright excited exciton energy levels is obtained in the range of electric fields corresponding to avoided crossings with lower levels .",
    "although in the presence of asymmetry of the coupled dots the trion is dissociated into an exciton and an electron by the electric field , for symmetric dots the dissociation mechanism is different , i.e. the trion is directly separated into an electron pair in one dot and the hole in the other .",
    "the trion is more stable against this mechanism of dissociation than the exciton .",
    "the process of trion dissociation into an exciton and a free electron that we obtain for the case of asymmetric coupling leads to a positive curvature of the pl line as a function of the electric field which has never been observed for the exciton ground state .    *",
