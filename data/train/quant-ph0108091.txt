    "many situations in the recent research in quantum games @xcite appear to be based on a general idea that is quite interesting as well .",
    "it is to take a classical game exhibiting certain features , generalize it to quantum domain , and see how the situation changes in the course of this generalization .",
    "in this course noncooperative games have attracted an earlier attention with the ruling solution concept of a nash equilibrium ( ne ) .",
    "this development looks reasonable because in classical game theory as well the earlier research was focused on noncooperative games and interest in coalition formation was revived later .",
    "players in noncooperative games are not able to form binding agreements even if they may communicate . on the other hand",
    "the distinguishing feature of cooperative games is a strong incentive to work together to receive the largest total payoff .",
    "these games allow players to form coalitions , binding agreements , pay compensations , make side payments etc .",
    "in fact , von neumann and morgenstern @xcite in their pioneering work in the theory of games offered models of coalition formation where the strategy of each player consists of choosing the coalition he wishes to join . in coalition games , that are part of cooperative game theory , the possibilities of the players are described by the available resources of different groups ( coalitions ) of players . joining a group or remaining outside is part of strategy of a player affecting his / her payoff .",
    "recent work in quantum games @xcite gives rise to a natural and interesting question : what is the possible quantum mechanical role in cooperative games that are an important part of the classical game theory ? in our opinion it may be quite interesting , and fruitful as well , to investigate coalitions in quantum versions of cooperative games .",
    "our motivation in present paper is to investigate what might happen to the advantage of forming a coalition in a quantum game compared to its classical analogue .",
    "we rely on the concepts and ideas of von neumann s cooperative game theory @xcite and consider a three - player coalition game in a quantum form .",
    "we then compare it to the classical version of the game and see how the advantage of forming a coalition can be affected .    in usual classical analysis of the coalition",
    "games the notion of a strategy disappears ; the main features are those of a coalition and the value or worth of the coalition .",
    "the underlying assumption is that each coalition can guarantee its members a certain amount called the `` value of a coalition '' @xcite__. _ _ _ the value of coalition measures the worth the coalition possesses and is characterized as the payoff which the coalition can assure for itself by selecting an appropriate strategy , whereas the ` odd man ' can prevent the coalition from getting more than this amount_. using this idea we study cooperative games in quantum settings to see how advantages of making coalitions can be influenced in the new settings .",
    "the preferable scheme to us to play a quantum game has been recently proposed by marinatto and weber @xcite . in this scheme",
    "an initial quantum state is prepared by an arbiter and forwarded to the players .",
    "each player possesses two quantum unitary and hermitian operators i.e. the identity @xmath0 and the inversion or pauli spin - flip operator @xmath1 .",
    "players apply the operators with classical probabilities on the initial quantum state and send the quantum state to the ` measuring agent ' who decides the payoffs the players should get .",
    "interesting feature in this scheme is that the classical game is reproduced when the initial quantum state becomes unentangled @xcite .",
    "classical game is therefore embedded in the quantum version of the game .    in this paper using marinatto and weber s scheme @xcite we find a quantum form of a symmetric cooperative game played by three players . in classical form of this game",
    "any two players out of three get an advantage when they successfully form a coalition and play the same strategy .",
    "we find a quantum form of this game where the advantage for coalition forming is lost and players are left with no motivation to cooperate .",
    "a classical three person normal form game @xcite is given by three non - empty sets @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , the strategy sets of the players @xmath5,@xmath6 , and @xmath7 and three real valued functions @xmath8",

    "the players in @xmath18 may form a coalition so that , for all practical purposes , the coalition @xmath18 appears as a single player .",
    "it is expected that players in @xmath20 will form an opposing coalition and the game has two opposing `` coalition players '' i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "we study quantum version of an example of a classical three player cooperative game discussed in ref .",
    "each of three players @xmath21 and @xmath7 chooses one of the two strategies @xmath22 .",
    "if the three players choose the same strategy there is no payoff ; otherwise , the two players who have chosen the same strategy receive one unit of money each from the ` odd man . '",
    "payoff functions @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 for players @xmath23 and @xmath7 respectively are given as @xcite @xmath24 with similar expressions for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
