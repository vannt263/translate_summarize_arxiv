    "they are also the primary source of heavy elements , and their ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation can inject vast amounts of energy and momentum into the natal medium .",
    "however , the formation and interaction of massive stars with their surrounding environment is not yet well understood , though it is well - accepted that they are usually associated with clusters @xcite .",
    "this empirical property of massive stars requires thorough observational studies of young stellar clusters in the galaxy .",
    "more recently , with the advent of far - infrared ( fir ) and submillimetre ( sub - mm ) observations , such clusters have been often found to be associated with filamentary structures @xcite . however , a study of such young stellar clusters , along with the role of filaments in the formation and evolution of dense massive star - forming clumps , is currently a matter of active investigation .",

    "furthermore , the advent of fir and sub - mm observatories like _ herschel _ has provided opportunity to explore the large - scale structures , as well as investigate theories such as the role of filaments in the formation of stellar clusters @xcite . since star formation in a region is a sum of many components , it is helpful to carry out an overall study at various wavelengths . in this work ,",
