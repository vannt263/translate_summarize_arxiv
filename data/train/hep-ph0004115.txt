    "here we propose an alternative approach to describe the structure of lepton mixing which accounts for the atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies  @xcite based on the simplest extension of minimal supergravity with bi - linear r  parity violation @xcite .",
    "the particles underlying the mechanism of neutrino mass generation are the neutral supersymmetric partners of the standard model gauge and higgs bosons which have mass at the weak - scale and are thus accessible to accelerators .",
    "our model breaks lepton number and therefore necessarily generates non - zero majorana neutrino masses  @xcite . at tree - level only one of the neutrinos picks up a mass by mixing with neutralinos  @xcite , leaving the other two neutrinos massless  @xcite . while this can explain the atmospheric neutrino problem , to reconcile it with the solar neutrino data requires going beyond the tree - level approximation",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",

    "bilinear r - parity breaking supersymmetry has been extensively discussed in the literature  @xcite .",

    "<S> the simplest unified extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with bi - linear r  parity violation naturally predicts a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum , in which one neutrino acquires mass by mixing with neutralinos , while the other two get mass radiatively . we have performed a full one - loop calculation of the neutralino - neutrino mass matrix in the bi - linear mssm , taking special care to achieve a manifestly gauge invariant calculation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we have performed the renormalization of the heaviest neutrino , needed in order to get meaningful results . </S>",
    "<S> the atmospheric mass scale and maximal mixing angle arise from tree - level physics , while solar neutrino scale and oscillations follow from calculable one - loop corrections . </S>",
    "<S> if universal supergravity assumptions are made on the soft - supersymmetry breaking terms then the atmospheric scale is calculable as a function of a single violating parameter by the renormalization group evolution due to the non - zero bottom quark yukawa coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the solar neutrino problem must be accounted for by the small mixing angle ( sma ) msw solution . </S>",
    "<S> if these assumptions are relaxed then one can implement large mixing angle solutions , either msw or just - so . </S>",
    "<S> the theory predicts the lightest supersymmetic particle ( lsp ) decay to be observable at high - energy colliders , despite the smallness of neutrino masses indicated by experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this provides an independent way to test this solution of the atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies .    </S>",
