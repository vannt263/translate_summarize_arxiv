    "the planck surveyor is the esa space mission devoted to the study of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "planck will have an impact on a number of scientific issues , such as the physics of the early universe , structure formation theory and cosmological parameters determination ( bersanelli et al . 1996 ) . in order to reach the necessary level of sensitivity",
    "it is important to understand systematics and to keep them under control . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the behavior of the planck low frequency instrument ( lfi , mandolesi et  al .",
    "1998 ) antenna patterns . for simplicity",
    ", we will restrict our analysis to the 30 ghz lfi channel but the method we present here can be easily extended to higher frequency channels .",
    "the beam pattern is affected by optical distortions , which depend on the telescope design and on the arrangement of the various feed horns in the focal plane .",
    "these effects degrade both angular resolution and sensitivity ( e.g. , mandolesi et al .  2000a , b ) .",
    "therefore , accurate measurement of the beam pattern is a crucial input to the data analysis pipeline .    due to their small angular size external planets",
    "produce large signals only when seen in the main beam . as such",
    ", they represent a unique possibility to recover directly from the data the in - flight behavior of the main beam .",
    "this point was already addressed , in the framework of the planck mission , by bersanelli et  al .",
    "1997 for the simple case of a gaussian symmetric antenna response .",
    "we extend here this analysis to quantify our ability to reconstruct a more realistic , asymmetric beam pattern .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sect .  2 we describe our main tools and assumptions .",
    "in sect .  3",
    "we discuss the quality of the main beam reconstruction and the implications for the treatment of planck data . as a byproduct of our simulations",
    ", we also verify in sect .",
    "[ internal_straylight ] the validity of the planck optical design to strongly suppress straylight contamination from internal solar system bodies . in sect .  5",
    "we summarize our findings and draw our conclusions .",
    "in order to attack the problem of the in - flight main beam reconstruction , we have to : ( _ i _ ) describe the planck orbit and scanning strategy ; ( _ ii _ ) quantify the antenna response ; ( _ iii _ ) exploit the planet s mm emission and positions ; ( _ iv _ ) simulate the planck observations of the external planets ( basically jupiter and saturn ) . here",
    "we briefly discuss these points separately .",
    "the selected orbit for the planck satellite is a lissajous orbit around the lagrangian point l2 of the sun - earth system ( e.g. , bersanelli et  al .",
    "1996 ) . in the nominal operation scheme the spacecraft spins at 1 r.p.m . around",
    "an axis kept parallel to the ecliptic plane . every hour the spin axis is moved by @xmath0 maintaining its anti - solar direction .",
    "the telescope optical axis is at an angle @xmath1 from the spin axis direction .",
    "the spin axis might precede about the anti - solar direction , with a period of about six months and an amplitude of about @xmath2 .",
    "this spacecraft movement is of course over imposed to the lissajous orbit and to the spin axis hourly shift . in this paper",
    "we consider values of @xmath1 between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , i.e. about the value of @xmath5 recently recommended by the planck science team .",
    "we make use of the planck flight simulator described in detail by burigana et  al .",
    "1997 , 1998 and maino et  al .",
    "1999 properly modified to model the planck observations of the solar system bodies and the spacecraft motion ( see , e.g. , bersanelli et  al .",
    "1997 ) .    for what follows ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce a telescope `` reference frame '' ( hereafter rf ) @xmath6 with the @xmath7 axis coincident with the direction of the telescope line of sight ( the @xmath8 direction , say ) and with the @xmath9 plane identifying the telescope field of view plane ( we choose to orient @xmath10 towards the intersection of the @xmath9 plane with the spin axis @xmath11 or , in the case @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) . for the considered scanning strategies the spin axis and the telescope directions ( @xmath11 and @xmath8 , respectively ) are easily derived given the observation time , the spinning frequency and the boresight angle @xmath1 .",
    "so it is always possible to pass from a chosen celestial rf to the telescope rf ( and viceversa ) by a suitable eulerian rotation of the considered rf .      the planck high frequency instrument ( hfi , puget et  al .",
    "1998 ) is located at the center of the focal plane .",
    "the lfi feed horns surround hfi and are then substantially off - axis .",
    "for instance , with a telescope of @xmath14  m class , the 30  ghz beams are at about @xmath15 from @xmath8 .",
    "so , it is convenient to define a beam rf @xmath16 with the @xmath17 axis coincident with beam axis @xmath18 and with the @xmath19 plane slightly tilted with respect to the telescope field of view plane ( we keep the convention of obtaining the beam rf from the telescope rf through a rotation of the telescope rf about an axis hortogonal to the plane identified by @xmath8 and @xmath20 by the angle necessary to transport @xmath8 to @xmath20 .",
    "as we know the position of each feed horn in the focal plane , we can always pass from the telescope rf to the beam rf and viceversa .",
    "in fact , the flight simulator determines for every time step the orientations in the sky of the telescope and beam reference frames , to compute the antenna response for a given line of sight .",
    "recent improvements on the planck optical design based on aplanatic solutions ( mandolesi et  al .",
    "2000b ) show that the main beams are roughly elliptical , with an ellipticity ratio @xmath21 ( alcatel , private reference , pl - as - tn-022 ) .",
    "therefore , we approximate the antenna pattern as an off - axis bivariate gaussian beam . for simplicity , we will consider the bivariate gaussian beam projected onto the field of view plane ( i.e. we will consider this beam representation on the @xmath9 plane , and not on the @xmath19 beam plane ) . to be accurate one has to say that if the true beam shape is elliptical in the @xmath19 plane , it gets distorted by the projection on the @xmath9 plane .",
    "however , since the off - axis angle even for the 30 ghz beam is small , this distortion is negligible and , if anything , does not change the elliptical nature of the beam response .",
    "in addition , a realistic main beam distortion implies a deviation from the elliptical shape larger than that introduced by this projection .",
    "so , let @xmath22 identify the projection of the beam centre unit vector onto the @xmath9 plane .",
    "let @xmath23 be the angle between the @xmath24-axis and the principal axis of the bivariate gaussian .",
    "the ( normalized to the maximum ) beam response can be then expressed as : @xmath25\\ ] ] where @xmath26 @xmath27 contains the bivariate s beam dispersions along the ellipse principal axis and @xmath28 is the rotation matrix for an angle @xmath23 in the @xmath9 plane : @xmath29 it is then convenient to define the beam `` sigma '' @xmath30 and the ellipticity ratio @xmath31 .      a realistic description of the antenna far side lobes has to rest on the accurate optical calculations of de maagt et  al . 1998 for the planck telescope including shields .",
    "several cuts at constant azimuthal angle @xmath32 are shown in fig .  1 as a function of the colatitude angle @xmath33 from the beam axis @xmath20 .",
    "in the `` antispillover '' region [ about @xmath34 where it is mostly important to evaluate the effects of straylight from the internal bodies of the solar system ( i.e. sun , earth and moon ) the pattern response drops down to approximately @xmath35 . at such a level of rejection , according to the planck requirements , one expects that sun , earth and moon are completely harmless for the mission .",
    "we will further discuss this point in sect .",
    "[ internal_straylight ] .",
    "several authors reported measurements of the planets brightness temperature at millimeter wavelengths with typical uncertainties of @xmath36 ( see , e.g. , bersanelli et  al . 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the quite large uncertainties associated with these values prevents one from using planets for accurate temperature calibration of the planck time order data .",
    "this will be done , to better than a @xmath37 , by using the diffuse signature of the cmb dipole anisotropy ( bersanelli et  al .",
    "however , for the purpose of beam reconstruction it is not necessary to have a detailed knowledge of the planet emission .",
    "it only matters that the source is stable and sufficiently bright to be detectable even when the source is far from the beam axis .",
    "this requirement is crucial to sample the antenna beam response at different angles .",
    "for this reason we will consider here only jupiter and saturn , which are the brightest of the external planets . on the basis of the published data , we will assume hereafter that jupiter and saturn have , at 30  ghz , brightness temperatures of @xmath38  k and @xmath39  k , respectively .",
    "the amount of straylight contaminations from the inner bodies of the solar system can be easily quantified .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the sun , earth and moon , because of their high intrinsic temperatures and because of the solid angles subtended from l2 .",
    "we will use @xmath40  k , @xmath41  k and @xmath42  k as the temperatures associated with the millimetric thermal emission of sun , earth and moon , respectively .",
    "we use the planck flight simulator in order to model the transit of the planets in the planck field of view .",
    "in particular , jupiter and saturn will be observed twice in about a year .",
    "the solid angle of the external planets as seen by planck is very small compared to the beam size .",
    "thus , the planck observations of the jupiter ( saturn ) will yield @xmath43 \\simeq { t^{(b ) } \\pi ( r / d)^2 ~j[{\\hat\\gamma(t)}-\\hat b ] \\over   \\int_{4\\pi } j({\\hat \\gamma})~ d \\omega }   \\ , .\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath44 is the observed jupiter ( saturn ) brightness temperatures @ 30 ghz ; @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the intrinsic jupiter ( saturn ) brightness temperature , radius and distance , respectively ; @xmath48 is the antenna response and @xmath49 identifies the angular position of the planet as seen by planck , the time dependence being fixed by the scanning strategy .",
    "[ [ minimum ] ]    the planck time ordered data ( tod ) are affected by instrumental noise .",
    "therefore , our capability to recover the main beam pattern rests on the possibility to clearly detect a bright source ( e.g. , jupiter ) , even when significantly far from the beam axis .",
    "a proper description of the planck - lfi instrumental noise should in principle include a @xmath50 contribution ( see , e.g. , bersanelli et  al .",
    "1996 , seiffert et  al .",
    "the knee - frequency of the @xmath50 noise is expected to be comparable with the spinning frequency .",
    "however , it has been shown that destriping algorithms can very efficiently remove this low frequency noise component even under more pessimistic conditions ( see , e.g. , maino et  al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) and return a tod that we will assume , accordingly with the goals of this paper , white noise dominated .",
    "so , in what follows we will model the tod noise component as pure white noise , with the planck goal sensitivities discussed by bersanelli et  al .",
    "1999 ( private reference , planck low frequency instrument , instrument science verification review , october 1999 , lfi design report ) . in principle , the signal fluctuations introduced by cmb and foreground anisotropies behave as a noise source in this context .",
    "however , since they can be accurately subtracted from the tod by using the planck final maps , we neglect them in what follows .",
    "we adopt here a simple scanning strategy with @xmath12 . in the simulations presented in sect .  3.1 , we oversample each scan circle every @xmath51 ( i.e. roughly 6 points per fwhm @ @xmath52 ) and shift the spin axis by @xmath53 every two hours .",
    "after simulating the jupiter and saturn transits we extract from the time ordered scans a few ( @xmath54 ) chunks comprising the source transit . since the source is pointlike ,",
    "these chunks give , when displayed one after the other and having taken into account the small variations of planet distance in the different samplings , a 2-d plot of the beam profile , @xmath55 wide .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the expected signal from jupiter as seen along the scan circle which crosses the source at the maximum ( top panel ) and as seen along an arc orthogonal to this circle ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the signal to noise can be improved , wrt the case of a single receiver and transit , by considering that two lfi receivers are coupled to the same optical beam , that there are two 30  ghz beams with the same optical properties and that two ( three ) transits of both jupiter and saturn are expected for a one year ( for a @xmath56 months ) mission .",
    "this obviously increases the signal to noise ratio by a factor of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) . as a result , @ 30 ghz",
    ", the shape of the main beam can be recovered down to @xmath59  db , i.e. at about @xmath60 .",
    "we consider both a symmetric and an elliptical beam , with ellipticity ratio @xmath61 .",
    "the numerical values of the beam parameters are shown in table  1 .",
    "we use eq.(1 ) to model the antenna response .",
    "we fit the beam shape theoretical parameters to the 2d plot of the beam response obtained as mentioned at the end of the previous section .",
    "the  results  of  the  fits  are  shown  in  table  2 .",
    "we fit also an additional parameter , @xmath62 , related to the planet brightness temperature and to the average distance of the planet from the spacecraft , @xmath63 , for the points considered in the fit : @xmath64 .",
    "we recover the full set of parameters with very high accuracy ( burigana et  al .",
    "2000c ) , the @xmath65 being always very close ( to better than @xmath37 ) to the unity value .",
    "it is obviously more efficient to recover the beam pattern parameters using jupiter rather than saturn , simply because jupiter is brighter .",
    "an interesting byproduct of the beam fitting procedure is the possibility of estimating the planet s antenna temperature , or more properly the product @xmath66 relevant for the planet s emission at the considered frequency .",
    "this quantity , as previously stated , is a poorly known quantity at lfi s frequencies . by considering eq.([par_beam ] ) it is clear that the latter temperature , @xmath45 is related to the normalization of the bivariate which is in turn very well constrained by our fit .",
    "the ability to estimate @xmath45 then rests upon the overall calibration accuracy and on the knowledge of the total antenna beam integral .",
    "calibration for planck will be provided by continuous observation of the cmb dipole signature and its modulation introduced by the spacecraft motion ( bersanelli et  al .",
    "1997 ) and is expected to be accurate to within 1% .",
    "the total integral of the antenna pattern poses a more serious problem , as the contribution of the far side lobes goes undetected when using a celestial source .",
    "however , optical calculations ( de maagt 1998 ) show that the contribution to the antenna pattern coming from outside the main lobe is expected to be @xmath67 of the total .",
    "the uncertainty on the latter figure may then dominate and pratically set the accuracy on the lfi estimate of @xmath45 ; therefore , even a poor knowledge of this contribution ( e.g. , with an accuracy of @xmath68 ) allow to reach a @xmath69 level of accuracy in the measurement of @xmath45 ( burigana et  al .",
    "2000c ) .",
    "[ problems ]    so far no systematic effect has been included in the simulations .",
    "one of the main goals of the planck mission is to limit the contamination arising from systematics at few @xmath70 level .",
    "however , systematics affecting the spacecraft pointing and rotation , which are not expected to significantly degrade the sky temperature estimation , may in principle turn out to be harmful when reconstructing the beam shape . to investigate this possibility",
    "we have extended our simulation to include these effects .      a potential problem for in - flight beam reconstruction is posed by the telescope pointing uncertainty , i.e. the limited accuracy in determining the spacecraft s effective spin axis .",
    "however , it is a planck requirement that such an uncertainty be less than @xmath71 .",
    "this is why , to simulate this effect we introduce a pointing uncertainty drawn from uniform distribution of values between 0 and 1 .",
    "since the spin axis direction is not expected to significantly change within the same scan , the uncertainties only arising when the spacecraft is repointed , we keep the perturbation constant along the scan .",
    "the impact of pointing uncertainty in the elliptical beam parameter recovery for the first transit of jupiter and saturn is also shown in table  2 .",
    "clearly , the higher signal to noise ratio in case of jupiter makes the results more sensitive to this kind of systematics .",
    "this is evident from the larger degradation of the beam parameter recovery .",
    "although the degradations in the recovered parameters are well above the corresponding quoted statistical errors , we do not find a particularly critical effect on the various parameters , except for the parameter @xmath72 , affected by an error of 10% by using jupiter , for the adopted level of pointing uncertainty . on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis of the @xmath65 ( @xmath73 ) clearly flags this problem . in this circumstance , it may be then particularly safe to take advantage of the saturn transits , that , although intrinsically noisier , are significantly less affected by this kind of systematics .",
    "we can then exploit the jupiter transits to check the fit results where the signal to noise ratio from saturn transits decreases .",
    "the reported values of @xmath74 can be understood on the basis of simple considerations .",
    "the derivative of a gaussian response , @xmath75 $ ] , with respect to the angle @xmath33 from the beam center at @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 ; for jupiter ( saturn ) , the signal at @xmath76 is @xmath78  mk ( @xmath79  mk ) for a beam with a fwhm  @xmath80 .",
    "then , a pointing error @xmath81 about @xmath76 implies a signal change of @xmath82  mk ( @xmath83  mk ) .",
    "let s assume such value of error in a squared region about the beam center with a 2@xmath84 side , containing @xmath85 samplings in the current simulations .",
    "the fit uses @xmath86 samplings with a white noise sensitivity of @xmath87  mk .",
    "we find then a @xmath74 of @xmath88 for jupiter ( and analogously @xmath89 for saturn ) , in good agreement with the values reported in table  2 .",
    "we have also verified the effect the spacecraft rotation during single sample integration .",
    "strictly speaking , the signal inside each sampling time changes according to the beam response .",
    "we can take this effect into account by oversampling and then averaging the simulated data inside each sampling time and by equivalently implementing in the fit procedure the recovery of the intrinsic ( i.e. non affected by rotation ) optical beam parameter .",
    "we have here implemented the impact of the satellite rotation only in the data flow generation , in order to estimate the error introduced in the beam parameter recovery by a simple fit procedure that does not take into account this effect .",
    "the results are again reported in table  2 for the first transit of jupiter and saturn in the case of an elliptical beam . as expected ,",
    "the effect on beam position and inclination is negligible . since in the present test the minor axis",
    "is taken along the scan circle direction , the beam is reconstructed with a smaller ellipticity and a larger fwhm with respect to the input values , with no indication of a worsening of the @xmath65 . clearly ,",
    "in the general case , the final effect will depend on a combination of beam ellipticity and inclination with respect to the sky scan direction .",
    "the beam parameters recovered by neglecting the spacecraft spinning within the sampling time in the fit procedure may also be seen as characterizing the `` effective '' properties of the beam in presence of spacecraft rotation .",
    "again , the `` effective '' values of @xmath84 reported in table  2 are in agreement with simple analytical considerations .",
    "in fact , the effective resolution which takes into account the intrinsic beam optical resolution and the beam smearing introduced by the satellite rotation is well approximated by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the angle ( @xmath51 for the present simulations ) in the sky described by the beam axis during the sampling time .",

    "we simulate jupiter transits as seen by an elliptical beam with the same parameters derived from the fit of the simulated beam , but in the case of the current simple baseline scanning strategy defined by @xmath227 , spin axis shift of @xmath0 every hour and by approximately 3 samplings per fwhm ( i.e. one point every @xmath224 along a scan circle @ 30  ghz ) .",
    "as expected , the beam parameters are recovered with an accuracy essentially unchanged with respect to the results of sect .",
    "3.1 ( see the last row of table  2 ) , in spite of the less regular grid in the @xmath228 plane , less refined ( by a factor @xmath229 ) along the scan direction than along that of the spin axis repointing .",
    "a crucial point for cmb anisotropy experiments is to estimate the impact of the quality of the main beam reconstruction on the data analysis and , ultimately , on the sky maps that can be obtained and on the related science .",
    "an accurate discussion of this problem is not the aim of this work .",
    "nevertheless , we want address here this argument . by including also the galaxy emission , only at low galactic latitudes and at the lowest lfi frequencies the impact of elliptical main beam distortions significantly increases ( by a factor @xmath230 ) with respect to the case of a pure cmb fluctuation sky ( burigana et  al .",
    "1998 ) whereas only very small effects are added by the combined effect of realistic main beam distortions and extragalactic source fluctuations ( burigana et  al .",
    "in addition , the main beam distortion impact moderately increases with the fwhm ( burigana et  al .",
    "1998 ) for the lfi resolution range .",
    "therefore , we will consider here for simplicity a pure cmb fluctuation sky in a reference case of a standard cdm model approximately cobe / dmr normalized and consider for the present analysis the 30  ghz channel . in fig .",
    "8 we report the difference between the signals obtained by convolving the sky with the bivariate main beam and with the circular main beam by assuming in each case the corresponding set of parameters that fits the simulated beam ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the rms of the temperature differences is @xmath231k . a similar comparison but between the circular and the simulated beam ( see fig .",
    "9 ) gives a very similar rms value , @xmath232k .",
    "this suggests that the ellipticity is the most relevant feature of the main beam shape .",
    "in fact , the comparison between the convolutions with the bivariate gaussian beam and the simulated one ( see fig .  10 ) gives a rms temperature difference of @xmath233k , a factor @xmath230 smaller than that obtained by approximating the beam with a symmetric gaussian shape .",
    "of course , when the planck optical design will be settled and the main beam patterns computed through optical simulation codes it would be possible to search for analytical descriptions of main beam shapes that might improve the bivariate gaussian approximation . anyway , we have proved here that this representation allow to reach the @xmath234k accuracy level in the treatment of planck - lfi tod s .",
    "by using the same method described in sect .  2 and the full antenna pattern shown in fig .  1 ( de maagt et  al",
    "1998 ) , we are able to quantify the impact of the internal solar system objects to the planck - lfi observations . the moon , the earth and the sun are the only internal bodies that may introduce appreciable straylight contamination . the solid angle of these objects ,",
    "although not negligible , is very small compared to the angular scale for which significant variations of the far pattern response occur ; this make the use of eq .",
    "( 2 ) accurate enough for the present purposes .    of course , the level of straylight contamination from these bodies depends also on the effective scanning strategy .",
    "we studied a lissajous orbit around l2 for the planck surveyor ( bersanelli et  al .",
    "1996 ) by considering @xmath235 the simple scanning strategy with the spin axis always parallel to the sun  spacecraft direction and @xmath236 a precession motion of the satellite spin axis like that discussed in sect .  2.1 .",
    "[ for this straylight analysis we assume @xmath237 , the value adopted in the optical computation by de  maagt et  al .",
    "1998 ] .    by coadding the tod computed as described in sect .  2 we have produced nearly full sky maps of averaged straylight contamination ( see burigana et  al .",
    "2000b for further details ) .",
    "[ we adopt here the healpix pixelisation by grski et al .",
    "we find that in any case this effect is very small , with the maximum contamination level always below @xmath238 .",
    "although small , this effect has to be considered with caution .",
    "in fact , this straylight contamination is produced by the very low response antenna in the `` antispillover '' region , where an accurate antenna response measurement is extremely difficult .",
    "we implemented the planck flight simulator ( burigana et  al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , maino et  al .",
    "1999 ) to properly discuss the impact of the solar system main bodies on the planck observations .",
    "in particular , we focused on the problem of the in - flight reconstruction of the main beam of the planck - lfi antenna patterns .",
    "to do so , we simulate in details the transits of jupiter and saturn in the field of view of the planck - lfi , 30 ghz beam .",
    "the method can be easily extended to the other planck channels .",
    "our analysis shows that , using jupiter , we can recover in flight the main beam response down to @xmath239  db , where the signal to noise ratio approaches unity .",
    "both symmetric and non symmetric beams have been considered ; in the latter case we assumed a simple elliptical shape , as suggested by recent optical simulations ( mandolesi et  al .",
    "2000b ) , but the method can be generalized to more refined parametrizations .",
    "we have demonstrated that the key parameters of the main beam ( resolution , ellipticity , position and inclination on the plane of planck field of view ) can be simultaneously recovered with high precision by fitting the planet transit signal . of course",
    ", the larger signal to noise ratio of jupiter ( compared to that of saturn ) translates in a better parameter recovery , by a factor @xmath240 .    after having considered the idealized case of pure white noise , we discussed possible degradations to the main beam reconstruction introduced by the effects of spacecraft pointing relevant in this context .",
    "spacecraft rotation does not affect significantly the quality of the reconstruction ; on the contrary , bu neglecting the spacecraft rotation in the fit procedure we derive the effective beam parameters including rotation smearing effect . the most relevant source of contamination is represented by the spin axis pointing uncertainty which can degrade the recovery of the beam ellipticity parameter @xmath72 by @xmath241 in the case of 1@xmath242 pointing error when jupiter is used .",
    "in these circumstance , clearly recognizable through the increase of the @xmath74 , we find very advantageous to consider saturn , that produce information less sensitive to this kind of systematics .",
    "to complete the analysis , we considered also the full recovery of a simulated beam shape for an aplanatic configuration of the optical design recently studied by alcatel .",
    "the beam shape can be reconstructed with good accuracy and resolution down to @xmath243  db .",
    "of course , somewhat lower response levels at larger angles from the beam centre can be measured in flight by relaxing the requirement of recovering the beam shape with the same resolution necessary to accurately describe the more central regions of the main beam .",
    "we addressed the study of the impact of the quality of the main beam reconstruction on the treatment of lfi tod s .",
    "we shown that a bivariate gaussian approximation represents a significant improvement with respect to a symmetric representation .",
    "a rms difference of @xmath233k is found between the tod obtained by convolving a cmb fluctuation sky with a simulated beam or its bivariate gaussian approximation as derived by the in - flight reconstruction , a result better by a factor three with respect to the case of the symmetric approximation .",
    "the possibility to combine a very accurate in - flight calibration by using the cmb dipole ( bersanelli et al .",
    "1997 ) and the good accuracy in the recovery of the maximum signal ( the parameter @xmath62 in table  2 ) at the planet transit , offers a good chance of measuring the intrinsic planet temperatures at millimetric wavelengths with an accuracy at % level , the main source of error being the uncertainty on the integrated antenna pattern response .",
