    "in a recent series of papers we have developed the notion of second order freeness @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this was motivated by the need for a framework for recent work on the global fluctuations of the eigenvalues of ensembles of random matrices ; see e.g. ambjrn , jurkiewicz , and makeenko @xcite , anderson and zeitouni @xcite , bai and silverstein @xcite , brzin and zee @xcite , diaconis @xcite , johansson @xcite , khorunzhy , khoruzhenko , and pastur @xcite .",
    "free independence , or what we shall call first order freeness , was created by voiculescu @xcite as an adaptation of the usual notion of independence to the non - commutative algebra of matrix valued ( or more generally operator valued ) random variables . the central object of voiculescu s theory",
    "is called the @xmath0-transform . for a random variable @xmath1",
    ", @xmath2 is a formal power series , which in most examples is an analytic function .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath2 are called the free cumulants of @xmath1 .",
    "the salient feature of voiculescu s theory is that given the moments of freely independent random variables , there is a universal rule for calculating the moments of sums and products of these random variables .",
    "second order freeness achieves for the _ fluctuation moments _ what first order freeness does for ordinary moments .",
    "moreover for many of the standard ensembles of random matrices , independent matrices are asymptotically free of second order , so the theory is quite widely applicable .",
    "speicher @xcite developed a combinatorial approach to free cumulants based on the non - crossing partitions of kreweras @xcite .",
    "this enabled the theory to be used in many cases where analytic expressions could not be found . in particular in @xcite ,",
    "krawczyk and speicher found the free analogue of the formula of leonov and shiryaev @xcite for calculating cumulants where the entries are products . in this paper",
    "we shall extend this result to the second order cumulants introduced in @xcite .",
    "we begin by motivating the definition of second order cumulants .",
    "let @xmath3 be a unitarily invariant ensemble of random matrices . by definition",
    "this means that the joint distribution of the entries of @xmath4 is the same as the joint distribution of the entries of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a @xmath7 unitary matrix .",
    "we shall say that the ensemble @xmath8 has a _ second order limit distribution _",
    "@xcite ) if for all integers @xmath9 and @xmath10 the limit    @xmath11 exists , and for @xmath12 , the limit @xmath13 exists , and for all @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 ,  , @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath20 classical cumulant , or semi - invariant ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "elements of the sequence @xmath21 are the moments of the limiting distribution .",
    "we shall call the elements of the sequence @xmath22 the _ fluctuation moments _ of the limiting distribution .",
    "these two sequences of moments may be then used to define a _",
    "second order _ non - commutative probability space on @xmath23 $ ] , the polynomials in the variable @xmath24 . by a second order non - commutative probability space we mean a triple @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a unital algebra over @xmath27",
