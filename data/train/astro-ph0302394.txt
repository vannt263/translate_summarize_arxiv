    "studying the physical conditions of weak absorbers ( eg . , metallicity , ionization conditions , total column density , and size ) is useful for two reasons : 1 ) physical conditions provide clues as to the nature of these absorbers , whose physical origin is not known ; 2 ) weak clouds provide an opportunity to study metal ",

    "a study of weak absorbers at @xmath13 requires spectra in both the optical and in the uv in order that the several key low and high ionization transitions ( especially , , ) , as well as the lyman series , are covered . using the keck / high resolution spectrograph ( hires )",
    "@xcite at high resolution ( @xmath14 ) and the faint object spectrograph ( fos)/_hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) at low resolution ( @xmath15 ) , @xcite applied photoionization models to @xmath16 single  cloud weak absorbers .",
    "they argued that many multiple cloud weak absorbers ( which comprise @xmath17% of the weak absorbers ) are likely to be part of the same population as the strong absorbers , but that single  cloud weak systems are likely to be a different population .",
    "at least half of the weak , single  cloud systems of @xcite require a second phase of gas in order to reproduce the absorption and/or to fit the profile without exceeding the column density derived from the lyman limit break .",
    "while the clouds typically have doppler parameters of @xmath18@xmath19  , the second phase must have a larger effective doppler parameter ( @xmath20@xmath21  ) . with only the low resolution uv data available to @xcite ,",
    "it was not clear if this implies a single broad component or multiple , blended clouds . also , in the systems for which the second phase is not required ( such as when only a limit for can be derived ) , it was not clear if the phase is just less extreme in its properties or if it is absent .    by comparing the column densities to the profiles",

    ". those systems with limits on may be part of a `` continuum '' of single ",

    "for the first time , weak absorbers can be studied through simultaneous high resolution coverage of numerous transitions .",
    "this allows more direct inferences of the physical properties of the gas , such as metallicity and phase structure . in particular",
    ", it should enable a determination of the nature of the second , broad phase required for some absorbers by the large relative strength of absorption in lower resolution data .",
    "is this higher  ionization , broad phase centered on the cloud or is it offset ?",
    "is it produced by multiple clouds or by a single , smooth structure ?",
    "are systems for which was not detected at low resolution fundamentally different , or do they merely have a weaker second phase ? the kinematics and physical properties of the second phase , and its relationship to the cloud phase , are important diagnostics of the type of structure responsible for the weak absorption .    in anticipation of the release of the high resolution stis / hst spectra , we previously pursued an in  depth study of four absorbers along the pg  @xmath0 line of sight @xcite using the available low resolution fos / hst spectra and the hires / keck spectra .",
    "since only the brightest quasars can , in the near future , feasibly be studied at high resolution in the uv , we aimed to compare inferences drawn on the basis of low resolution spectra to those that would be obtained once the higher resolution spectra were released .",
    "confirmation of our conclusions would lend credibility to larger statistical studies that rely on a combination of high and low resolution spectra @xcite .",
    "the present paper focuses on three single  cloud weak absorbers along the pg  @xmath0 line of sight .",

    "the `` wings '' of the profile in the low resolution spectrum were apparently due to fos fixed pattern noise rather than to an extremely broad phase , since these features are not apparent in the high resolution stis spectrum .    from this very limited comparison",

    "we would then expect many systems to be observed for lines of sight that pass through only the higher ionization region of such structures .",
    "these `` only systems '' might typically have lower column densities than two  phase weak systems .",

    "2 ) in the second scenario the lower ionization components could be produced by parts of a shell structure surrounding a lower density , higher ionization region .",
    "the covering factors for the low ionization shell fragments would be limited ( @xmath209 ) by the lack of observation of many two  cloud weak systems .",
    "however , with such a small covering factor , we would again expect a large incidence of `` only systems '' which in this scenario would tend to have similar phases to those of two  phase weak systems .",

    "many other lines of sight need to be systematically surveyed , but there clearly will be limits on the geometry and covering factors of the two phases of gas .",
    "an alternative to the idea of embedded phases is to have separate clouds along the line of sight with different densities and sizes .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of an offset cloud in the @xmath28 system , and the spread of three clouds over @xmath180   in the @xmath35 system .",
    "these separate clouds could exist as condensations in larger structures with velocity dispersions of tens of , e.g. , dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , if the phases were all completely separate from each other then it would be hard to explain the close alignment in velocity of the lower ionization cloud with one of the higher ionization clouds .",
    "the metallicities of these absorbing structures present a clue as to their place of origin .",

    "the phase of some strong absorbers is reminiscent of what would be expected for a corona such as that observed in and absorption around the milky way disk .",
    "the single cloud weak absorbers , although they do have a second phase , do not appear to be related to such a corona .",
    "the combination of stis / hst and hires / keck high resolution spectra , covering multiple chemical transitions , provided the first opportunity to collect direct information on the metallicities and phase structure of weak absorbers .",

    "all three of these absorbers have a second , higher ionization phase , giving rise to the absorption .",
    "the broad phase in one case is consistent with a single cloud , and in the other two cases requires one or two additional clouds separated in velocity space from the one aligned with the absorption .",
    "two of the weak absorbers are constrained to have solar or greater than solar metallicity , and the other one to have a metallicity greater than @xmath214th solar .",
    "thus , in general , weak absorbers are not weak because of a low metallicity ( confirming the result of @xcite ) . as introduced in   [ sec : intro ] , it is also possible that they have weak absorption because they are more highly ionized than their strong counterparts , or because their total column densities are smaller .",
    "the likely answer is that there is some combination of these two effects , perhaps leading to different populations of weak absorbers arising in different environments .",
