    "the concept of localization of a quantum particle in a random potential was introduced by p.w .",
    "anderson [ 1 ] in his pioneering work in 1958 .",
    "although considerable progress has been made since then , the problem still resists a complete theoretical understanding . in further developing ideas by thouless [ 2 ] ,",
    "abrahams et al . [ 3 ] formulated a real space scaling theory of localization in 1979 , which is based on the assumption that the dimensionless conductance @xmath0 of a sample with finite length @xmath1 is the only relevant scaling parameter .",
    "the assumptions of the one - parameter scaling theory were supported by the work of wegner [ 4 ] and others [ 5 - 7 ] , who mapped anderson s original hamiltonian onto non - linear @xmath2 models of interacting matrices and applied perturbative renormalization group calculations in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "self- consistent theories [ 8 , 9 ] , developed at the same time , also yielded scaling [ 10 ] in agreement with these field theoretical treatments . in this way it was established",
    "that the anderson transition is a continuous phase transition characterized by a diverging length , critical exponents and an order parameter .",
    "however , in recent years the validity of the one - parameter scaling theory has been called into question by several new developments : ( 1 ) the discovery of large , universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic samples [ 11 , 12 ] has raised the question whether the distribution of conductances rather than the ensemble - averaged conductance @xmath0 would obey one - parameter scaling [ 13 , 14 ] or whether more than one scaling parameter would be required in the strong coupling regime [ 15 , 16 ] .",
    "( 2 ) recent results [ 17 , 18 ] concerning localization on a bethe lattice , which were obtained within the supersymmetric matrix model introduced by efetov [ 19 ] , show a non - power law singularity at the transition point with an exponentially vanishing diffusion coefficient at the metallic side and a diverging localization length with critical exponent @xmath4 at the insulating side .",
    "( 3 ) according to kravtsov , lerner and yudson [ 20 ] , in the non - linear @xmath2 model there exist relevant operators from higher gradients , which may indicate a violation of one - parameter scaling .",
    "furthermore , wegner [ 21 ] performed an @xmath5 expansion for the non - linear @xmath2 model and found in four - loop order a correction to the critical exponent @xmath6 in @xmath7 dimensions which violates an exact relation for @xmath6 established by chayes et al . [ 22 ] .",
    "thus , it is unclear whether the asymptotic @xmath5 expansion about @xmath8 can be extended to @xmath9 dimensions ] . in this spirit ,",
    "zirnbauer [ 23 ] has done a non - perturbative calculation in @xmath7 within efetov s model using the migdal - kadanoff approximate renormalization scheme .",
    "the question of the precise critical behavior near the anderson transition remains controversial up to now . in the present paper",
    "we want to address a different problem , namely how to connect the critical regime with the parame- ters of the hamiltonian in a quantitative way . to this end",
    ", the self - consistent theory originally devised by vollhardt and wlfle [ 8 ] is extended to the lattice and fully renormalized in the sense that the calculation of all quantities entering the self - consistency equation is extended to the strong coupling regime . as will be seen below , the self - consistent expansions in terms of small and large disorder , respectively , are equivalent at the level of maximally crossed diagrams .",
    "one - parameter scaling is an inescapable consequence of the diagrammatic expansion , unless there exist as yet undiscovered infrared - divergent contributions besides that class of diagrams .",
    "however , by comparing with independent numerical renormalization group calculations [ 24 ] for the same model one may gain some insight in how wide the critical region around the transition point is in which deviations from one - parameter scaling occur and in which other infrared singularities not contained in the present theory might become important .    in the next section , quantities which behave non - critical at the anderson transition are calculated in single - site approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "section 3 contains the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation for the density correlation function following vollhardt and wlfle [ 8 ] , which leads to a frequency dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath10 expressed in terms of the irreducible particle - hole vertex part @xmath11 . in section 4",
    ", @xmath11 is calculated by classifying all irreducible particle - hole diagrams in terms of the most important infrared - divergent contributions , and a self - consistent equation is derived in this way . from this equation ,",
    "the @xmath12 function of the length dependent conductance @xmath0 is obtained in section 5 along with a discussion of its validity in the strong coupling regime .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section 6 .",
    "the model under consideration is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath13 with random site energies @xmath14 , distributed according to probability @xmath15 and hopping amplitudes @xmath16 from site @xmath17 to site @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "later evaluations will be done for isotropic nearest neighbor hopping @xmath20 and for box , gaussian and lorentzian probability distributions @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the step function , and the width @xmath26 plays the role of the disorder parameter .",
    "the width of the gaussian distribution is scaled in such a way that the second moments of @xmath21 and @xmath22 coincide .",
    "the usual expansion with respect to small disorder @xmath27 is done in terms of bloch states repeatedly scattering off the impurity levels ( extended state expansion ) .",
    "thus , the single - particle green function is expanded as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the retarded / advanced free green function of a bloch state in momentum representation and @xmath30 is the dispersion on a @xmath31-dimensional simple cubic lattice with nearest neighbor hopping .",

    "1 ) by attaching the corresponding impurity lines to the same point and introduces irreducible diagrammatic parts in the calculation of averaged quantities . then , @xmath32 satisfies the dyson equation @xmath35 which is easily solved in momentum space : @xmath36 the self - energy @xmath37 represents the sum of all irreducible diagram parts with respect to cutting one propagator line @xmath38 .",
    "the averaging process causes a technical difficulty which is due to the discreteness of the lattice and , therefore , is present in any lattice model : in any averaged diagram , lattice sums are restricted to sites which do not occur anywhere else in the diagram , since coinciding sites would change its topological structure .",
    "this difficulty is lifted exactly by extending the sums over all lattice sites and correcting for the oversummations by subtracting `` multiple occupancy corrections '' ( mocs ) [ 25 ] .",
    "mocs are generated out of any given irreducible diagram by breaking off impurity lines from common sites in all possible ways and subtracting these terms from the original diagram .",
    "moc diagrams may , in turn , require mocs ( next generation ) if they have multiple impurity lines at any site .",
    "the construction of mocs is illustrated in fig",
    "alternatively , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) allows an expansion in powers of @xmath39 , treating the kinetic term as a perturbation ( locator expansion ) [ 25 , 26 ] .",
    "the unperturbed on - site green function , or locator at site @xmath18 , is then given by @xmath40 diagrammatically , each term in this expansion is represented by ( vertical ) locator lines @xmath41 attached to the corresponding sites and connected by ( horizontal ) hopping lines @xmath42 .",
    "similarly as in the extended state expansion , it is useful to define a self - resolvent @xmath43 as the sum of all irreducible diagrams with respect to cutting one hopping line , so that the full , averaged green function satisfies the dyson equation @xmath44    or , in momentum space , @xmath45 by comparison of eqs .",

    "this will be done in single - site or coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , which amounts to summing up all irreducible diagrams , including mocs , that do not contain any crossings of lines .",
    "the resulting self - consistency equation for the self - energy is given by @xmath47g^{r / a}_0(e ) } \\right >   = 0   \\",
    ", \\label{eq : selfenergy_avg } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the brackets denote the ensemble averaging and @xmath48 .",
    "note that in cpa the self - energy is momentum independent .",
    "the cpa can be viewed as the first order of a self - consistent cluster expansion and is known [ 28 ] to become exact in the limit of large lattice coordination numbers ( or high dimensions ) .",
    "furthermore , by employing the identity ( 11 ) it can be shown [ 29 , 27 ] that the single - site approximations for the extended state and for the locator expansion are equivalent .",
    "thus , the cpa interpolates between the exact limits of strong and weak disorder .",
    "( it can not account for a correct description of the singularities at the band edges , however . )",
