    "track finding for the predicted particle densities is one of the most challenging tasks in the alice experiment @xcite .",
    "it is still under development and here the current status is reported .",
    "track finding is based on the kalman - filtering approach .",
    "kalman - like algorithms are widely used in high - energy physics experiments and their advantages and shortcomings are well known .",
    "there are two main disadvantages of the kalman filter , which affect the tracking in the alice tpc @xcite .",
    "the first is that before applying the kalman - filter procedure , clusters have to be reconstructed .",
    "occupancies up to 40% in the inner sectors of the tpc and up to 20% in the outer sectors are expected ; clusters from different tracks may be overlapped ; therefore a certain number of the clusters are lost , and the others may be significantly displaced .",
    "these displacements are rather hard to take into account . moreover , these displacements are strongly correlated depending on the distance between two tracks .",
    "the other disadvantage of the kalman - filter tracking is that it relies essentially on the determination of good ` seeds ' to start a stable filtering procedure .",
    "unfortunately , for the tracking in the alice tpc the seeds using the tpc data themselves have to be constructed .",
    "the tpc is a key starting point for the tracking in the entire alice set - up .",
    "until now , practically none of the other detectors have been able to provide the initial information about tracks .",
    "on the other hand , there is a whole list of very attractive properties of the kalman - filter approach .",
    "* it is a method for simultaneous track recognition and fitting .",
    "* there is a possibility to reject incorrect space points ` on the fly ' , during the only tracking pass .",
    "such incorrect points can appear as a consequence of the imperfection of the cluster finder .",
    "they may be due to noise or they may be points from other tracks accidentally captured in the list of points to be associated with the track under consideration . in the other tracking methods one usually needs an additional fitting pass to get rid of incorrectly assigned points . * in the case of substantial multiple scattering ,",
    "track measurements are correlated and therefore large matrices ( of the size of the number of measured points ) need to be inverted during a global fit . in the kalman - filter procedure we only have to manipulate up to @xmath2 matrices",
    "( although many times , equal to the number of measured points ) , which is much faster . * using this approach one can handle multiple scattering and energy losses in a simpler way than in the case of global methods . *",
    "kalman filtering is a natural way to find the extrapolation of a track from one detector to another ( for example from the tpc to the its or to the trd ) .",
    "the following parametrization for the track was chosen : @xmath3 the state vector @xmath4 is given by the local track position _",
    "x _ , _ y _ and _ z _ , by a curvature _ c _ , local _ x_@xmath5 position of the helix center , and dip angle @xmath6 : @xmath7    because of high occupancy the standard kalman filter approach was modified .",
    "we tried to find maximum additional possible information which can be used during cluster finding , tracking and particle identification .",
    "because of too many degrees of freedom ( up to 220 million 10-bit samples ) we have to find a smaller number of orthogonal parameters .    to enable using the optimal combination of local and global information about the tracks and clusters , the parallel kalman filter tracking method was proposed .",
    "several hypothesis are investigated in parallel .",
    "the global tracking approach such as hough transform was considered only for seeding of track candidates . in the following",
    ", the additional information which was used will be underlined .",
    "the accuracy of the coordinate measurement is limited by a track angle which spreads ionization and by diffusion which amplifies this spread .",
    "the track direction with respect to pad plane is given by two angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see fig .  [ figtpc ] ) .",
    "for the measurement along the pad - row , the angle @xmath8 between the track projected onto the pad plane and pad - row is relevant . for the measurement of the the drift coordinate ( _ z_direction )",
    "it is the angle @xmath9 between the track and _ z _ axis ( fig .",
    "[ figtpc ] ) .",
    "the ionization electrons are randomly distributed along the particle trajectory . fixing the reference _ x _ position of an electron at the middle of pad - row , the _ y _ ( resp .",
    "_ z _ ) position of the electron is a random variable characterized by uniform distribution with the width @xmath10 , where @xmath10 is given by the pad length @xmath11 and the angle @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 ) : @xmath12    the diffusion smears out the position of the electron with gaussian probability distribution with @xmath13 .",
    "contribution of the @xmath14 and unisochronity effects for the alice tpc are negligible .",
    "the typical resolution in the case of alice tpc is on the level of @xmath15  0.8  mm and @xmath16  1.0  mm integrating over all clusters in the tpc .",
    "being collected on sense wire , electron is `` multiplied '' in strong electric field .",
    "this multiplication is subject of a large fluctuations , contributing to the cluster position resolution . because of these fluctuations",
    "the center of gravity of the electron cloud can be shifted .",
    "each electron is amplified independently . however , in the reconstruction electrons are not treated separately .",
    "the centre of gravity ( cog ) of the cluster is usually used as an estimation for the local track position .",
    "the influence of the gas gain fluctuation to the reconstructed point characteristic can be described by a simple model , introducing a weighted cog @xmath17 @xmath18 where _ n _ is the total number of electrons in the cluster and @xmath19 is a random variable equal to a gas amplification for given electron .",
    "the mean value of @xmath17 is equal to the mean value @xmath20 of the original distribution of electrons @xmath21    however , the same is not true for the dispersion of the position , @xmath22    where @xmath23    the diffusion term is effectively multiplied by gas gain factor @xmath24 . for sufficiently large number of electrons , when @xmath25 and @xmath26 are quasi independent variables , equation ( [ eqcogggfactor0 ] )",
    "can be transformed to the following    @xmath27    gas gain fluctuation of the gas detector working in proportional regime is described with the exponential distribution with the mean value @xmath28 and r.m.s . @xmath29    substituting @xmath30 into equation ( [ eqcogggfactore ] ) @xmath31    gas multiplication fluctuation in chamber deteriorates @xmath32 by a factor of about @xmath33 .",
    "the prediction of this model is in good agreement with results from the simulation .      charged particle penetrating the gas of the detector produces _",
    "n _ primary electrons .",
    "primary electron _",
    "i _ produces @xmath34 secondary electrons .",
    "each of these electrons is amplified in the electric field by a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "each primary cluster is characterized by a position @xmath36 with mean value @xmath20 and @xmath37 . the cog given by equation ( [ eqcogdefgg ] )",
    "is modified to the following form :    @xmath38    a new variable @xmath39 is introduced as the total electron gain : @xmath40    knowing the distribution of _ n _ and _ g _ and assuming that _ n _ and _ g _ are independent variables the mean value and variance of the @xmath39 can be expressed as :    @xmath41    inserting @xmath39 into equation ( [ eqcogdefggpio ] ) results in an equation similar to the equation ( [ eqcogdefgg ] ) .",
    "multiplicative factor @xmath42 is defined as an analog of @xmath24 , from the equation ( [ eqcogggfactor0 ] ) @xmath43    using the new variable @xmath39 and simply replacing gas gain _",
    "g _ by @xmath39 in the similar way as in equation ( [ eqcogggfactore ] ) does not work . for @xmath44 parametrization of secondary ionization process @xmath45",
    "goes to infinity and thus @xmath46 .",
    "moreover @xmath47 and @xmath48 are not quasi independent as the sum @xmath48 could be given by one `` exotic '' electron cluster .",
    "approximations used for deriving the equation ( [ eqcogggfactore ] ) are not valid for secondary ionization effect .    in order to estimate",
    "the impact of this effect on cog equation ( [ eqcoglfactor0 ] ) has to be solved numerically .",
    "simulation showed that @xmath42 does not depend strongly on the cut used for maximum number of electrons created in the process of secondary ionization .",
    "a change of the cut , from 1000 electrons up produces a change of about 3% in @xmath42 .",
    "equation ( [ eqcogggfactore ] ) is not applicable in this situation because of the infinity of the @xmath49 . according to the simulation , the threshold on the number of electrons in the cluster has a little influence to the resulting @xmath42 .",
    "therefore we fit simulated @xmath42 with formula ( [ eqcogggfactore ] ) where @xmath50 was a free parameter .",
    "however , this parametrization does not describe the data for wide enough range of _ n_. in further study the linear parametrization of the cog factor was used .",
    "this parametrization was validated on reasonable interval of _ n_.",
    "detected position of charged particle is a random variable given by several stochastic processes : diffusion , angular effect , gas gain fluctuation , landau fluctuation of the secondary ionization , @xmath14 effect , electronic noise and systematic effects ( like space charge , etc . ) .",
    "the relative influence of these processes to the resulting distortion of position determination depends on the detector parameters . in the big drift detectors like the alice tpc the main contribution",
    "is given by diffusion , gas gain fluctuation , angular effect and secondary ionization fluctuation .",
    "furthermore we will use following assumptions :    * @xmath51 primary electrons are produced at a random positions @xmath36 along the particle trajectory . *",
    "@xmath52 electrons are produced in the process of secondary ionization .",
    "* displacement of produced electrons due to the thermalization is neglected .",
    "each of electrons is characterized by a random vector @xmath53 @xmath54 where _ i _ is the index of primary electron cluster and _ j _ is the index of the secondary electron inside of the primary electron cluster .",
    "random variable @xmath55 is a position where the primary electron was created .",
    "the position @xmath56 is a random variable specific for each electron .",
    "it is given mainly by a diffusion .",
    "the center of gravity of the electron cloud is given : @xmath57    the mean value @xmath58 is equal to the sum of mean values @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the sigma of cog in one of the dimension of vector @xmath61 is given by following equation @xmath62    if the vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 are independent random variables the last term in the equation ( [ eqcogsigsec ] ) is equal to zero .",
    "@xmath65 r.m.s . of cog distribution",
    "is given by the sum of r.m.s of _ x _ and _ y _ components .    in order to estimate the influence of the @xmath14 and unisochronity effect to the space resolution two",
    "additional random vectors are added to the initial electron position .",
    "@xmath66    the probability distributions of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are functions of random vectors @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and they are strongly correlated .",
    "however , simulation indicates that in large drift detectors distortions , due to these effects , are negligible compared with a previous one .    combining previous equation and neglecting @xmath14 and unisochronity effects",
    ", the cog distortion parametrization appears as : + @xmath71 of cluster center in _ z _ ( time ) direction @xmath72    and @xmath73 of cluster center in _",
    "y_(pad ) direction @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the total number of electrons in the cluster , @xmath76 is the number of primary electrons in the cluster , @xmath77 is the gas gain fluctuation factor , @xmath78 is the secondary ionization fluctuation factor and @xmath79 describe the contribution of the electronic noise to the resulting sigma of the cog .",
    "we have derived parametrization using as parameters the total number of electrons @xmath75 and the number of primary electrons @xmath76 .",
    "this parametrization is in good agreement with simulated data , where the @xmath75 and @xmath76 are known .",
    "it can be used as an estimate for the limits of accuracy , if the mean values @xmath80 and @xmath81 are used instead .",
    "the @xmath75 and @xmath76 are random variables described by a landau distribution , and poisson distribution respectively .    in order to use previously derived formulas ( [ eqresz1 ] , [ eqresy1 ] )",
    ", the number of electrons can be estimated assuming their proportionality to the total measured charge @xmath82 in the cluster .",
    "however , it turns out that an empirical parametrization of the factors @xmath83 gives better results . formulas ( [ eqresz1 ] ) and ( [ eqresy1 ] ) are transformed to following form : + @xmath71 of cluster center in _ z _ ( time ) direction : @xmath84    and @xmath73 of cluster center in _",
    "y_(pad ) direction : @xmath85",
    "the shape of the cluster is given by the convolution of the responses to the electron avalanches .",
    "the time response function and the pad response function are almost gaussian , as well as the spread of electrons due to the diffusion .",
    "the spread due to the angular effect is uniform . assuming that the contribution of the angular spread does not dominate the cluster width , the cluster shape is not far from gaussian .",
    "therefore , we can use the parametrization    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the normalization factor , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are time and pad bins , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are centers of the cluster in time and pad direction and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the r.m.s . of the time and pad cluster distribution .",
    "the mean width of the cluster distribution is given by : @xmath94    @xmath95    where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the r.m.s .",
    "of the time response function and pad response function , respectively .",
    "the fluctuation of the shape depends on the contribution of the random diffusion and angular spread , and on the contribution given by a gas gain fluctuation and secondary ionization .",
    "the fluctuation of the time and pad response functions is small compared with the previous one .",
    "the measured r.m.s of the cluster is influenced by a threshold effect .",
    "@xmath98 the threshold effect can be eliminated using two dimensional gaussian fit instead of the simple cog method .",
    "however , this approach is slow and , moreover , the result is very sensitive to the gain fluctuation .    to eliminate the threshold effect in r.m.s .",
    "method , the bins bellow threshold are replaced with a virtual charge using gaussian interpolation of the cluster shape .",
    "the introduction of the virtual charge improves the precision of the cog measurement .",
    "large systematic shifts in the estimate of the cluster position ( depending on the local track position relative to pad  time ) due to the threshold are no longer observed .",
    "measuring the r.m.s .",
    "of the cluster , the local diffusion and angular spread of the electron cloud can be estimated .",
    "this provides additional information for the estimation of distortions .",
    "a simple additional correction function is used : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is calculated according formulas [ eqresy1 ] and [ eqresz1 ] , and the @xmath101 is the relative distortion of the signal shape from the expected one .",
    "the classical approach for the beginning of the tracking was chosen . before the tracking itself , two - dimensional clusters in pad - row  time planes are found .",
    "then the positions of the corresponding space points are reconstructed , which are interpreted as the crossing points of the tracks and the centers of the pad rows .",
    "we investigate the region 5@xmath1025 bins in pad - row  time plane around the central bin with maximum amplitude .",
    "the size of region , 5@xmath1025 bins , is bigger than typical size of cluster as the @xmath92 and @xmath103 are about 0.75 bins .",
    "the cog and r.m.s are used to characterize cluster .",
    "the cog and r.m.s are affected by systematic distortions induced by the threshold effect .",
    "depending on the number of time bins and pads in clusters the cog and r.m.s .",
    "are affected in different ways .",
    "unfortunately , the number of bins in cluster is the function of local track position .",
    "to get rid of this effect , two - dimensional gaussian fitting can be used .",
    "similar results can be achieved by so called r.m.s .",
    "fitting using virtual charge .",
    "the signal below threshold is replaced by the virtual charge , its expected value according a interpolation .",
    "if the virtual charge is above the threshold value , then it is replaced with amplitude equal to the threshold value .",
    "the signal r.m.s is used for later error estimation and as a criteria for cluster unfolding .",
    "this method gives comparable results as gaussian fit of the cluster but is much faster .",
    "moreover , the cog position is less sensitive to the gain fluctuations .",
    "the cluster shape depends on the track parameters . the response function contribution and diffusion contribution to the cluster r.m.s .",
    "are known during clustering .",
    "this is not true for a angular contribution to the cluster width .",
    "the cluster finder should be optimised for high momentum particle coming from the primary vertex . therefore",
    ", a conservative approach was chosen , assuming angle @xmath8 to be zero .",
    "the tangent of the angle @xmath9 is given by _",
    "z_-position and pad - row radius , which is known during clustering .",
    "the estimated width of the cluster is used as criteria for cluster unfolding . if the r.m.s . in one of the directions",
    "is greater then critical r.m.s , cluster is considered for unfolding .",
    "the fast spline method is used here .",
    "we require the charge to be conserved in this method . overlapped clusters are supposed to have the same r.m.s .",
    ", which is equivalent to the same track angles . if this assumption is not fulfilled , tracks diverge very rapidly .",
    "the unfolding algorithm has the following steps :    * six amplitudes @xmath104 are investigated ( see fig .",
    "[ figunfolding1 ] ) .",
    "first ( left ) local maxima , corresponding to the first cluster is placed at position 3 , second ( right ) local maxima corresponding to the second cluster is at position 5 .",
    "* in the first iteration , amplitude in bin 4 corresponding to the cluster on left side @xmath105 is calculated using polynomial interpolation , assuming virtual amplitude at @xmath106 and derivation at @xmath107 to be 0 .",
    "amplitudes @xmath108 and @xmath109 are considered to be not influenced by overlap ( @xmath110 and @xmath111 . *",
    "the amplitude @xmath112 is calculated in similar way . in the next iteration the amplitude @xmath105 is calculated requiring charge conservation @xmath113 .",
    "consequently @xmath114 and @xmath115    two cluster resolution depends on the distance between the two tracks .",
    "until the shape of cluster triggers unfolding , there is a systematic shifts towards to the cog of two tracks ( see fig .",
    "[ figunfoldingres ] ) , only one cluster is reconstructed . afterwards , no systematic shift is observed .",
    "the cluster is characterized by the cog in _ y _ and _ z _ directions ( fy and fz ) and by the cluster width ( fsigmay , fsigmaz ) .",
    "the deposited charge is described by the signal at maximum ( fmax ) , and total charge in cluster ( fq ) .",
    "the cluster type is characterized by the data member fctype which is defined as a ratio of the charge supposed to be deposited by the track and total charge in cluster in investigated region 5@xmath1025 .",
    "the error of the cluster position is assigned to the cluster only during tracking according formulas ( [ eqztotamp ] ) and ( [ eqytotamp ] ) , when track angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 are known with sufficient precision .    obviously , measuring the position of each electron separately the effect of the gas gain fluctuation can be removed , however this is not easy to implement in the large tpc detectors .",
    "additional information about cluster asymmetry can be used , but the resulting improvement of around 5% in precision on simulated data is negligible , and it is questionable , how successful will be such correction for the cluster asymmetry on real data .",
    "however , a cluster asymmetry can be used as additional criteria for cluster unfolding .",
    "let s denote @xmath116 the _ i_-th central momentum of the cluster , which was created by overlapping from two sub - clusters with unknown positions and deposited energy ( with momenta @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) .",
    "let @xmath119 is the ratio of two clusters amplitudes : @xmath120 and the track distance _ d _ is equal to @xmath121    assuming that the second moments for both sub - clusters are the same ( @xmath122 ) , two sub - clusters distance _ d _ and amplitude ratio @xmath119 can be estimated : @xmath123    in order to trigger unfolding using the shape information additional information about track and mean cluster shape over several pad - rows are needed .",
    "this information is available only during tracking procedure .",
    "the first and the most time - consuming step in tracking is seed finding .",
    "two different seeding strategies are used , combinatorial seeding with vertex constraint and simple track follower .",
    "combinatorial seeding starts with a search for all pairs of points in the pad - row number _ i_1 and in a pad - row _ i_2 , @xmath124 rows closer to the interaction point ( @xmath125 at present ) which can project to the primary vertex .",
    "the position of the primary vertex is reconstructed , with high precision , from hits in the its pixel layers , independently of the track determination in the tpc .",
    "algorithm of combinatorial seeding consists of following steps ;    * loop over all clusters on pad - row _ i_1 * * loop over all clusters on pad - row _ i_2 , inside a given window .",
    "the size of the window is defined by a cut on track curvature ( _ c _ ) , requiring to seed primary tracks with @xmath126 above a threshold . * * * when a reasonable pair of clusters is found , parameters of a helix going through these points and the primary vertex are calculated . parameters of this helix are taken as an initial approximation of the parameters of the potential track . the corresponding covariance matrix is evaluated using the point errors , which are given by the cluster finder , and applying an uncertainty of the primary vertex position .",
    "this is the only place where a certain ( not too strong ) vertex constraint was introduced .",
    "later on , tracks are allowed to have any impact parameters at primary vertex in both the @xmath127-direction and in @xmath128-@xmath129 plane . * * * using the calculated helix parameters and their covariance matrix the kalman filter is started from the outer point of the pair to the inner one . * * * if at least half of the potential points between the initial ones were successfully associated with the track candidate , the track is saved as a seed . * * end of loop over pad - row 2 * end of loop over pad - row 1      seeding between two pad - rows , _ i_1 and",
