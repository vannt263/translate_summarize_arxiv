    "mafia ( also called werewolf ) is a popular party game @xcite .",
    "the participants collect in a circle and a game coordinator assigns each player to one of two groups : a mafia or citizens .",
    "citizens know only their own identity , whereas mafia members know identity of their fellows . the objective is to eliminate the opponent group .",
    "the game consists of two alternating phases ( day and night ) . during the day , all players can discuss and vote who they want to lynch . during the night the mafia kills a citizen of their choice .",
    "there are many variants of the mafia game .",
    "the most common modification of the gameplay is the addition of characters with special abilities .",
    "usually there are two special citizens : detective ( who checks every night if a chosen person is in the mafia ) and nurse ( who may protect a victim from being killed , if she chooses correctly ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the simplest version of the mafia game . that is , with only mafia and citizens , and without any special players or additional rules .",
    "even if it may not be the most popular variant , it is the best one for mathematical modelling . despite the game having a complex psychological component it is possible to create a stochastic model of the mafia game .",
    "we consider a game beginning with @xmath1 players , out of which there are @xmath2 mafia members .",
    "the main questions we address are :    * what is the probability that the mafia wins @xmath0 ?",
    "* how does the dynamics of the game look like ?",
    "that is , what is the chance that after a given time there is exactly a certain number of mafia members ?    besides the direct answers ( i.e. closed form expressions ) , we study approximations , qualitative behavior and some special cases",
    ".    there are only a few previous papers on the mafia game .",
    "works @xcite and @xcite basically propose the same model as the one presented in this paper .",
    "they calculate a simple asymptotic formula for the mafia - winning chance , @xmath3 .",
    "other research projects concentrate on the psychological aspect of the mafia game , in particular  deceiving .",
    "topics analyzed include : patterns of a deceiver s interruptions and voice parameters @xcite , movement of face and hands @xcite and usage of language @xcite .",
    "also , the mafia game is applied as a test for some videoconferencing setups @xcite .",
    "the research is motivated by two goals , besides the sheer fun of calculation and writing .",
    "first , a good theoretical model may be useful for the investigation of the psychological aspect of the mafia game .",
    "experimental deviations from the idealized behavior may give a valuable insight into psychology of strategy choosing , manipulation , deceiving , following others and hiding identity .",
    "second , when a small , but well - informed and powerful group fights against the majority , the nature of the process may be similar to that of the mafia game .",
    "such real - life phenomena include actions of secret societies as in high - stake corruption , terrorism and illegal oppositions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : model ] we introduce the rules of the mafia game and propose a simple mathematical model .",
    "section  [ s : one ] contains a special case of play with only a single mafia member .",
    "the results are not only simple and didactic , but also useful for a more general case .",
    "section  [ s : qualitative ] gives simple results on the qualitative behavior of the mafia - winning chance .",
    "section  [ s : evolution ] presents the dynamical aspect of the mafia game and gives closed - form expressions for dynamics of the game .",
    "we consider both the discrete - time model and its continuous time approximation . in section",
    "[ s : general ] we provide the exact result for the mafia - winning chance , together with its asymptotic approximation .",
    "section  [ s : conclusion ] concludes the work and gives insight into possible extensions and applications .",
    "appendices [ appendixa ] and [ appendixb ] contain derivations of formulas found in sec .",
    "[ s : evolution ] .",
    "before proceeding to mathematics , we need to write down our arbitrarily chosen rules of the mafia game .",
    "some assumptions are made to simplify the model , others purely for convenience .",
    "note that this section is only a hand - waving transition from the real - life game to its mathematical model .    *",
    "the game needs @xmath1 players and one more person to coordinate it .",
    "* at the beginning players are randomly divided into ( @xmath4 ) citizens and @xmath2 mafia members .",
    "* mafia members know the identity of each other , citizens  only their own .",
    "* there are two alternating phases , day and night , which together comprise a turn . * during day , there are two consecutive subphases : * * debate .",
    "everyone still alive can say anything related to accusing or defending . * * voting .",
    "everyone has exactly one vote , who he wants to lynch .",
    "the player who gets the highest number of votes is eliminated ( in case of a tie , a random winner is eliminated ) .",
    "* during the night : * * mafia jointly decides who they want to kill ( eliminate ) . *",
    "the game continues until there is only one group ( either the citizens or the mafia ) left . that group wins",
    ".    stated briefly , during the day one player is eliminated ( either a citizen or a mafia member ) whereas during the night the mafia kills one citizen .",
    "consequently , during a single turn the possible transitions are : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "their probabilities , in principle , depend on @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the course of the play ( i.e. previous discussions and votings ) . to start with , we need to get rid of the psychological aspect , restricting ourselves only to strategic and probabilistic parts of the mafia game .",
    "it is a coarse approximation , as psychology plays an essential role in the mafia game .",
    "nevertheless , even such a bare model has interesting properties .",
    "moreover , we want to neglect the discussion phase as it is extremely difficult to formalize in a meaningful and useful way .    now , let s make a hand - waving argument why the transition probability depends only on the current state @xmath7 .",
    "consider the scenario , in which players are lynched at random , that is @xmath8 = \\frac{n - m}{n } \\quad \\hbox{and } \\quad p\\left [ ( n-2,m-1)| ( n , m ) \\right ] = \\frac{m}{n}.\\label{eq : transition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let s denote by @xmath0 the mafia - winning chance , induced by the above transition probabilities .",
    "suppose that there is a better strategy ( in the common sense of the word ) for citizens , giving it @xmath9 .",
    "then the mafia can force a random lynch , just by pretending they are citizens .",
    "it is possible as :    * each mafia member knows more than any citizen . * in such case there is no way to detect a mafia member .",
    "suppose that there is a better strategy for the mafia , @xmath10 .",
    "if the citizens are in majority , they can force a random lynching by the following procedure :    * one citizen says `` let s every of us give a number @xmath11 from @xmath12 to @xmath1 , we will kill the @xmath13-th '' . *",
    "the number @xmath13 is random , so is the chosen player . *",
    "as there are more citizens than mafia members , mafia votes do not play any role .",
    "if the citizens are in the minority ( i.e. @xmath14 ) no matter what the moves are , the mafia will win .",
    "for @xmath15 let s assume a random player is lynched .",
    "consequently , random lynch is a well - justified strategy .",
    "a more detailed argument is shown in @xcite . as a direct consequence of",
    ", the mafia winning - chance can be expressed as a recurrence equation @xmath16 the above equation is the core of our paper .",
    "we investigate it for one mafia member ( section [ s : one ] ) , its qualitative behavior ( section [ s : qualitative ] ) and closed - form solution along with its asymptotic formula ( section [ s : general ] ) .",
    "it is important to point out that we may set different boundary conditions , i.e. in which if there is the same number of citizens and mafia members , mafia wins .",
    "that is , in we may write @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 . in that case",
    "all results can be reproduced , perhaps in a slightly changed form ( i.e. different constants and even@xmath19odd ) .    .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "to start with , we want to consider a very simple case  the game with only a single mafia member .",
    "that is , in this section we analyze @xmath20 . besides the simplicity",
    ", there are two more motivations : this case gives insight into some general properties and the results will be useful in the further part of the paper .    in a game with one mafia member ,",
    "their winning probability is the chance that during every lynch a citizen is killed .",
    "bearing in mind that we start the game with the day phase , we get @xmath21 the above formula has an explicit dependence on the parity of @xmath1 .",
    "even though it is obvious that addition of @xmath22 citizens reduces mafia - winning chance @xmath23 , it is not the case for addition of a single citizen .",
    "in fact , addition of an odd player ( holding @xmath24 ) increases the mafia - winning chance . to understand this",
    "let s use an example . in a play with one citizen and one mafia member ,",
    "there is tie in voting , so lynching relies on tossing a coin and @xmath25 . in a game with two citizen , the mafia also wins after lynching a citizen ( the second one is to be killed during the night ) .",
    "this time it is more difficult to hunt mafia , and @xmath26 .",
    "one may think that we encountered an issue of boundary conditions ( i.e. killing a random player in a tie ) or that we considered too small @xmath1 .",
    "neither is the case .",
    "a careful reader may easily check that changing @xmath27 if @xmath28 to @xmath27 if @xmath29 in we get an analogous phenomena .",
    "we may simply check that adding an odd player always increases the mafia winning - chance , @xmath30 that is , @xmath31 .",
    "let s consider @xmath20 averaged over neighbouring numbers .",
    "we use the geometric mean , as it simplifies the result @xmath32 the averaging may be considered an approximation in which we get a monotonic function ( without the sawtooth pattern ) . to get some information on the dependence of @xmath20 on the parity of @xmath1 we consider the following ratio @xmath33",
    "the above expression has a limit when @xmath34 goes to infinity , which can be found with the aid of the wallis formula : @xmath35    we may develop approximate formulas for the single mafia member winning - chance , which take into account parity of the number of players @xmath36 or , bearing in mind @xmath37 , @xmath38    as we see , the recurrence equation produces results that might be counter - intuitive .",
    "imagine there are four of us and we are playing with a single mafia member .",
    "his winning - chance is @xmath39 .",
    "then we invite five more friends to play as additional citizens .",
    "consequently , the mafia winning - chance rise to @xmath40 ( contrary to a naive expectation ) .    .",
    "dots illustrate the exact result , whereas the lines represent the approximations  solid and dashed line for even and odd number of players , respectively.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "it is worth investigating the qualitative behavior of @xmath0 .",
    "some questions , which naturally arise , are :    * does the addition of two citizens increase their winning - chance , i.e. is @xmath41 ?",
    "* does the addition of one citizen and one mafia member increase the mafia winning - chance , i.e. is @xmath42 ? * does the change of one player from a mafia member to a citizen decrease the mafia winning - chance , i.e. is @xmath43 ?",
    "in fact , the above questions are equivalent , as we can see using using the recurrence relation @xmath44 for @xmath45 . after some cosmetic arithmetical operations we get @xmath46 & = m \\left [ w(n , m)-w(n , m-1 ) \\right],\\label{eq : dwie_sciezki}\\\\      n\\left [ w(n , m ) - w(n-2,m-1)\\right ] & = ( n - m ) \\left [ w(n-2,m)-w(n-2,m-1 ) \\right].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above relations can be directly translated into @xmath47    in addition to the equivalence of the obvious inequalities , we are interested whether they are fulfilled . let s utilize the third part of in the following form :    if a mafia member is changed into a citizen , the mafia winning - chance does not increase , that is @xmath48 .",
    "if additionally @xmath49 , the inequality is strong , @xmath50 .    let s introduce an agent to a game with @xmath1 players among which there are @xmath2 mafia members .",
    "the agent is an additional player who simulates either a citizen or a mafia member .",
    "we are going to show that the agent does not have to reveal its identity until the very late part of the game .",
    "as citizens are indistinguishable , let s assume that mafia kills them during night in a fixed sequence .",
    "let the agent have the last position . during the lynching",
    "there are three possibilities    * a citizen dies .",
    "* a mafia member dies .",
    "* the agent dies .    in the case of the agent s death ,",
    "his affiliation has no meaning . in the two remaining situations",
    ", the game continues with the agent .",
    "the agent s affiliation plays a decisive role in two situations :    * when all mafia members are dead .",
    "* when @xmath51@xmath12 citizens and @xmath12@xmath22 mafia members remain .    in both cases",
    "when the agent is a mafia member , the mafia winning - chance increase :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is tempting to estimate the mafia winning - chance .",
    "as @xmath52 is the probability that the citizens won , setting time for which there is only one player left gives the total citizen winning - chance : @xmath53 not surprisingly , in the continuous - time approximation , there is no explicit dependence on parity ( the discrete properties are lost ) .",
    "the result for @xmath54 is not only interesting by itself  it also gives us the solution for the mafia winning - chance .",
    "note that @xmath55 is the probability that after @xmath56 turns citizens win .",
    "when total number of players is odd , game lasts for @xmath57 days and nights , leaving 1 player alive .",
    "thus @xmath58 is the probability the citizen win the game . for an even number of players ,",
    "after @xmath59 turns there are no players alive .",
    "but now @xmath60 is the probability that there are no mafia members , so in fact  no - one was killed during the last night and citizen win .",
    "so @xmath61 .",
    "consequently , the closed form formula for the mafia winning - chance reads @xmath62    let s show what we have proven for a game with only one mafia member  the asymptotic behavior .    to get the asymptotic formula for @xmath0 it suffices to notice that in the limit @xmath63 ( taken over a selected parity ) only the first two terms of the sum contribute . for @xmath64",
    "the term is equal to @xmath12 .",
    "the terms with @xmath65 do not matter as @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , we may write @xmath67 where we used the result from game with one mafia member , that is , approximating with .",
    "the approximate formula can be formally expressed as @xmath68    it is tempting to ask for the optimal number of mafia members @xmath69 , for a given number of players .",
    "an interesting game is one in which both groups have the same chance of winning @xmath70 which are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mopt ] .",
    "for which @xmath71 is the closest to @xmath72 .",
    "lines show the approximation .",

    "in this paper we make , and solve , a mathematical model of the mafia game .",
    "the starting point of our calculations is random lynching process .",
    "the main interest of this research is analysis of the mafia winning - chance @xmath0 .",
    "we find the closed - form solution , as well as its asymptotic approximation .",
    "we prove some discrete properties of @xmath0 , namely that adding two citizens decreases the mafia winning - chance , whereas adding a citizen ( which is an odd player )  increases .",
    "the dynamics of the game is also of our interest .",
    "we calculate the probability that after @xmath56 days and nights there is exactly a certain number of mafia members alive .",
    "we obtain closed - form expressions and their convenient approximations .    in every realistic mafia game",
    ", there is a psychological part .",
    "a dry mathematical model may be a backbone of a more complex one , but certainly , is not enough to describe a real game .",
    "during course of play , citizens gain some information  either by discovering another s identity by themselves , or trying to catch messages .",
    "furthermore , voting may be subject to some kind of witch - hunt mentality .",
    "moreover , rarely are all players the same  usually there are ones with higher and lower influence on the others .",
    "all these processes may be investigated mathematically , or numerically .",
    "there is still a lot of challenge in finding an appropriate model and obtaining the results .",
    "comparison of the theory with the experiment may be crucial .    out of author s personal experience , in games when players do nt know each other ,",
    "usually a random person is killed ( e.g. a person who is always nervous , not just because of being in the mafia ) . when they know each other very well , very dim signals can be used to reveal one s identity .",
