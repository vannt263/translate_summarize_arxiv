    "an open quantum system is a certain distinguished quantum system which is coupled to another quantum system , its environment @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple way of describing an open system is obtained in the markovian approximation . in this approximation",
    "all memory effects due to system - environment correlations are neglected which usually leads to a markovian master equation , that is , to a linear first - order differential equation for the reduced density matrix @xmath2 of the open system with a time independent generator . generally , one demands that the generator is in lindblad form @xcite , which follows from the requirements of the conservation of probability and of the complete positivity of the dynamical map @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of markovian master equations in lindblad form is given by the fact that they allow a stochastic representation , also known as unraveling , by means of a stochastic schrdinger equation ( sse ) for the state vector of the open system @xcite .",
    "a sse generates the time evolution of the state vector which results from a continuous monitoring of the environment of the system @xcite .",
    "a specific realization @xmath3 of the sse is called a quantum trajectory : at each time @xmath4 the open system is known to be in a definite state @xmath5 under the condition that a specific readout of the monitoring of the system s environment is given . the reduced density matrix at time @xmath6",
    "is therefore obtained if one averages the quantity @xmath7 over all possible quantum trajectories .",
    "this means that the relation @xmath8 $ ] holds , where the symbol @xmath9 denotes the ensemble average or expectation value .    in the markovian case it is thus true that the environment acts as a quantum probe by which an indirect continuous observation of the system is carried out .",
    "the description by means of a markovian master equation in lindblad form is , however , only an approximation which uses the assumption of short correlation times . for strong couplings and low temperature environments",
    "memory effects can lead to pronounced non - markovian behavior .",
    "it is sometimes argued that the treatment of non - markovian processes by means of master equations necessarily requires solving integro - differential equations for the reduced density matrix .",
    "such equations arise , for example , in the application of the nakajima - zwanzig projection operator technique @xcite which leads to dynamic equations involving a retarded memory kernel and an integration over the past history of the system .",
    "however , the usage of another variant of the projection operator method allows in many cases the derivation of approximate or even exact non - markovian master equations for the reduced density matrix which are local in time .",
    "this method is known as the time - convolutionless ( tcl ) projection operator technique @xcite .",
    "the non - markovian character of the tcl master equation is reflected by the fact that its generator may depend explicitly on time and may not be in lindblad form .",
    "time - local equations which are of the form of the tcl master equation have also been derived by other means , e.  g. , by path integral and influence functional techniques @xcite .",
    "a well known example is provided by the exact equation of motion for a damped harmonic oscillator coupled linearly to a bosonic reservoir @xcite .",
    "the fact that the tcl generator is generally not in lindblad form leads to several important mathematical and physical consequences .",
    "in particular , a stochastic unraveling of the tcl master equation of the form indicated above does not exist : any such process will automatically produce a master equation whose generator is in lindblad form .",
    "the question is therefore as to whether one can develop a general method for the construction of stochastic schrdinger equations for non - markovian dynamics which do have a physical interpretation in terms of continuous measurements .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that this is indeed possible .",
    "our starting point is a time - local non - markovian master equation for the density matrix @xmath2 on some hilbert space @xmath0 with a time dependent and bounded generator",
    ". it will be demonstrated that the dynamics given by such a master equation can always be embedded in a markovian dynamics on an appropriate extended state space .",
    "the non - markovian dynamics thus appears as part of a markovian evolution in a larger state space .",
    "if one chooses the extended state space as the hilbert space of the total system , consisting of open system plus environment , this statement is of course trivial .",
    "however , it turns out that the embedding can be realized in a fairly simple , much smaller state space , namely in the tensor product space @xmath1 . in physical terms",
    "this is the state space of a composite quantum system which results if one combines the original open system on the state space @xmath0 with a further auxiliary three state system described by the state space @xmath10 .",
    "the open system could be , for example , a damped quantum particle interacting with a dissipative environment .",
    "the auxiliary system can then be realized through an additional internal degree of freedom of the particle which leads to a state space spanned by three basis states .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the dynamics in the extended state space follows a markovian master equation with a time dependent generator in lindblad form .",
    "the application of the standard unraveling of markovian master equations to the dynamics in the extended state space therefore yields a stochastic unraveling for the non - markovian dynamics .",
    "the resulting sse generates genuine quantum trajectories which do admit a physical interpretation in terms of a continuous observation carried out on an environment .",
    "the construction thus gives rise to a consistent measurement interpretation for non - markovian evolution in full agreement with the general setting of quantum measurement theory .",

    "the particular form of the generator derives from the requirements of complete positivity and of the conservation of the trace @xcite .",

    "the state vector then performs the jump @xmath48 thus we see that @xmath49 is an integer - valued process which counts the number of jumps of type @xmath45 .",

    "( [ sse ] ) yields a piecewise deterministic process , i.  e. , a random process whose realizations consist of deterministic evolution periods interrupted by discontinuous quantum jumps .",

    "this fact was the original motivation for the development of stochastic wave function methods in atomic physics and quantum optics ( for an example , see @xcite ) .",
    "what is important in our context is the fact that , additionally , the stochastic process given by the sse allows a physical interpretation in terms of a continuous measurement which is carried out on an environment of the system .    to explain this point we consider a microscopic model in which the open system is weakly coupled to a number of independent reservoirs @xmath54 , one reservoir for each value of the index @xmath45 .",

    "<S> a large class of non - markovian quantum processes in open systems can be formulated through time - local master equations which are not in lindblad form . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that such processes can be embedded in a markovian dynamics which involves a time dependent lindblad generator on an extended state space . if the state space of the open system is given by some hilbert space @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the extended state space is the triple hilbert space @xmath1 which is obtained by combining the open system with a three state system . </S>",
    "<S> this embedding is used to derive an unraveling for non - markovian time evolution by means of a stochastic process in the extended state space . </S>",
    "<S> the process is defined through a stochastic schrdinger equation which generates genuine quantum trajectories for the state vector conditioned on a continuous monitoring of an environment . </S>",
    "<S> the construction leads to a continuous measurement interpretation for non - markovian dynamics within the framework of the theory of quantum measurement . </S>"
