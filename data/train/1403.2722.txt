    "a number of observations , mainly at radio frequencies , have established that relativistic particles and magnetic fields are part of the intracluster medium ( icm ) of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the large ( @xmath8mpc ) scale , diffuse structures known as radio halos and relics are produced by relativistic electrons spiraling around @xmath8@xmath7 g magnetic fields .",
    "the synchrotron emission is a product of both the particle and magnetic field energy densities , the latter of which is not well constrained globally from these or other observations .",
    "however , the electron population can be independently detected through inverse compton ( ic ) scattering off of ubiquitous cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , which are up - scattered to x - ray energies and may be observable if the electron population is sufficiently intense @xcite . for single electrons or populations with power law energy distributions ,",
    "the ratio of ic to synchrotron flux gives a direct , unbiased measurement of the average magnetic field strength @xmath9 in the icm of a cluster .",
    "the magnetic field plays a potentially important role in the dynamics and structure of the icm , such as in sloshing cool cores where @xmath9 may be locally amplified so that the magnetic pressure is comparable to the thermal pressure @xcite .",
    "detections of ic emission , therefore , probe whether the non - thermal phase is energetically important or , particularly if the average magnetic field is large , it is sizable enough to affect the dynamics and structure of the thermal gas .",
    "the quest for the detection of ic emission associated with galaxy clusters began with the launch of the first x - ray sensitive sounding rockets and satellites , although the origin of extended , @xmath8  kev x - rays from clusters was soon recognized to be thermal ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "even so , in clusters with radio halos or relics , ic emission _ must _ exist at some level , since the cmb is cosmological .",
    "thermal x - ray photons are simply too numerous at @xmath10  kev for a reliable detection of the ic component ; at higher energies , however , the bremsstrahlung continuum falls off exponentially , allowing the non - thermal ic emission to eventually dominate and produce `` excess '' flux in the spectrum .",
    "while the first ic searches with yielded only upper limits , and thus lower limits on the average strength of icm magnetic fields , @xmath11 g @xcite , the next generation of hard x - ray capable satellites  and",
    " produced detections in several clusters , although mostly of marginal significance ( for a review , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the most recent observatories  and  however , have largely failed to confirm ic at similar levels @xcite .",
    "one exception is the bullet cluster ( a.k.a .",
    "1e 0657 - 56 , rx j0658 - 5557 ) , although the detection significance of the non - thermal component is marginal in both the and data alone .",
    "the observation of the bullet cluster s had x - ray emission was not very constraining , but the overall spectrum from the pca and hexte instruments , fit jointly with mos data , favored a non - thermal tail at not quite @xmath12 significance @xcite .",
    "a two - temperature model fit the data equally well , but the higher temperature component had a nearly unphysically high temperature ( @xmath13  kev ) for a large ( 10% ) fraction of the total emissivity . in a similar analysis ,",
    "the data were simultaneously fit with a spectrum from the bat all sky survey , and the non - thermal component was confirmed at the @xmath14 confidence level @xcite .",
    "a two - temperature model technically did a better job of describing the spectra , although the secondary temperature component was very low ( 1.1  kev ) , causing the authors to reject this interpretation .",
    "while this low temperature component is certainly not physical , the fact that a model can fit the data so well when an extra component is added solely at low energies indicates that the non - thermal component is not being strongly driven by the bat data .",
    "further confirmation of an ic component in the bullet cluster is clearly necessary to rule out a purely thermal description of the hard band emission and uphold the implied magnetic field strength of @xmath15 g .",
    "the intriguing evidence for a non - thermal excess at hard energies coupled with its smaller angular size makes the bullet cluster an ideal galaxy cluster target for the x - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "is the first focusing hard x - ray telescope with a bandpass between 3 and 80  kev and is the first telescope with the ability to focus x - rays in the hard x - ray band above 10  kev .",
    "it has an effective area at 30  kev of @xmath16 @xmath17 and imaging half power diameter ( hpd ) of @xmath18 .",
    "while the effective area is somewhat lower than that of previous instruments , the focusing capability vastly reduces the background level and its associated uncertainties . whereas collimators onboard , , and have quite large ,",
    "@xmath19fields of view ( fovs ) that include substantial emission from cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) sources , the equivalent region of the bullet cluster within spans @xmath20 less solid angle on the sky . also , for clusters that fit well within s @xmath21fov , simultaneous offset regions can be used to precisely characterize the background to an extent not possible with collimated instruments .",
    "we describe the two observations and their generic processing in section  [ sec : obs ] . in section  [ sec : cal ] , the modeling of the background and its systematics and the overall flux calibration are briefly described ( see appendices  [ sec : appendixbgd ] and [ sec : appendixsim ] for details ) .",
    "we examine hard band images and the character of the global spectrum in section  [ sec : analy ] .",

    "the optical axis fell near the centroid of the large - scale x - ray emission in the first observation and near the western shock driven by the bullet subcluster in the second .",
    "the first pointing was carried out over a little under 3 days , 1820 october 2012 , for a total unfiltered exposure of 231 ks .",
    "for the second pointing , the bullet cluster was observed for a slightly longer raw exposure of 287 ks from 14 november 2012 . to filter the events , standard pipeline processing ( heasoft v6.13 and nustardas v1.1.1 )",

    "these additional flags reduce the cleaned exposure time by @xmath24% from what it would otherwise be , but also reduce background uncertainties .",
    "no strong fluctuations are present in light curves culled from the cleaned events , suggesting a stable background , so no further time periods were excluded .    from the cleaned event files , we directly extract images like those shown in figure  [ fig : rawimgs ] and light curves using xselect , create exposure maps using nuexpomap , and extract spectra and associated response matrix ( rmf ) and auxiliary response ( arf ) files using nuproducts .",
    "the call to nuproducts includes extended = yes , most appropriate for extended sources , which weights the rmf and arf based on the distribution of events within the extraction region , assuming that to be equivalent to the true extent of the source .",
    "although the effective smoothing of the source due to the point spread function ( psf ) is not folded in with the weighting , the relatively narrow full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath8 18lessens the impact of this omission .",
    "the response across a given detector is largely uniform , so the rmfs of the four detectors are simply averaged by the weighted fraction each detector contributes to a region .",
    "in addition to the mirror response , the arf includes low energy absorption in the detectors ( due to a czt dead layer and platinum electrodes ) and is also `` corrected '' to a canonical power law crab spectrum of photon index 2.1 and normalization 9.7 photons s@xmath4",

    "one of s pioneering technologies , at least for an astrophysics x - ray mission , is the separation of its optics and focal plane modules by an open mast structure that was extended after launch .",
    "the telescope is thus open and subject to stray light , which dominates the background at low energies and creates a spatial gradient across the fov .",
    "the stray light must be distinguished from the instrumental background , which varies from detector to detector but is otherwise spatially uniform , in order to use local background regions for any source region .",
    "also , because the psf scatters some emission outside our extraction region , we must estimate the fraction of the emission collected within the region by convolving the cluster s true spatial distribution with the psf , which varies with off - axis angle .",
    "our solution to these challenges is outlined below .      as is typical",
    ", the background has both intrinsic and extrinsic components , which for vary in relative importance both spectrally , spatially , and somewhat temporally . for faint sources where the background is a significant fraction of the source counts , it is to some degree inappropriate to naively extract and rescale a spectrum from elsewhere in the fov to use as a background .",
    "however , because the background components are reasonably well understood and stable , we can model its instantaneous composition from source - free regions and , using what we know about the spatial variations of each component , extrapolate that model to the source region . the physical origin of the background components are briefly described below ; for details on the specific models and how the background is actually fit with them , see appendix  [ sec : appendixbgd ] .",
    "these components are all identified in the spectra shown in figure  [ fig : app : stack ] , and it may benefit the reader to refer to it and the following section simultaneously .      *",
    "internal * : the radiation environment of s orbit leads to a roughly flat background across all channels .",
    "an underlying featureless continuum is produced primarily , but probably not entirely , by high energy gamma rays that either pass through the anti - coincidence shield and compton scatter in the detector or scatter untriggered in the shield itself .",
    "the remainder of the internal background consists of various activation and fluorescence lines , which are mostly resolved and only dominate the background between 22 - 32  kev . above these energies",
    "weaker lines are still present , but the continuum dominates . more details can be found in appendix  [ sec : appendixbgd : overview ] * aperture stray light * : because the space between the optics and focal plane benches is not fully baffled , a series of aperture stops protrude from the focal plane bench to block unfocused x - rays from striking the detectors ( for a diagram of this geometry , see figure  [ fig : app : geometry ] ) . due to technical implementation limitations",
    ", the aperture stop does not exclude 100% of the stray light , leaving a few degree window centered on each mirror module .",
    "although the optics bench itself blocks much of the fov , there remain lines of sight connecting every detector pixel , through the aperture stop , to regions of open sky .",
    "the amount of sky visible to any given pixel is location - dependent . since the cxb is roughly uniform on large scales , the stray light from the cxb through the aperture stop ( hereafter called the  aperture \" background ) produces a smooth gradient across the detector plane that depends on the orientation of the detectors and the apparent position of the optics module .",
    "the cxb spectral shape is consistent with that found by previous missions , and we adopt the canonical _",
    "heao-1 a2 _ spectral model , valid from 360  kev @xcite .",
    "due to cosmic variance , the precise normalization for any given observation should be measured intrinsically ( see appendix  [ sec : appendixsim ] for details ) .",
    "* reflected and scattered stray light * : besides direct exposure to sources of stray light , the open geometry of the spacecraft is susceptible to reflected and scattered x - rays from the entire sky .",
    "one possible reflecting surface  along with many other parts of the observatory , including the mast  is the backside of the aperture stops , which are clearly visible to the detectors .",
    "there are three potential sources of reflected emission : the cxb , the earth , and the sun .",
    "because such a large fraction of the sky is visible to the backside of the aperture stops , they are capable of reflecting a contribution of 10 - 20% of the total unfocused ( i.e. ,  aperture \" ) cxb emission despite their smaller solid angle and low reflectivity . assuming the spectrum is unchanged and uniformly illuminates the detectors , this extra emission simply adds to that coming through the aperture stops .",
    "emission from the sun (  solar \" ) , and potentially the earth s albedo , is much softer and also much more variable . during episodes of high solar activity ,",
    "the background below @xmath25 56  kev will be dominated by a @xmath26  kev thermal spectrum of solar abundance , but even during less active periods this component accounts for @xmath27% of the @xmath28  kev total .",
    "the `` solar '' emission is only present when the satellite is illuminated by the sun , so there is no doubt as to its origin .",
    "there are also some weak fluorescence lines from material elsewhere on the spacecraft , such as the mast , that contribute to the background , although their origin and contribution is still under active investigation .",
    "* focused cosmic background * : unlike the above components , there always exists an inherent `` background '' from other unresolved foreground / background sources within the fov that are not of primary scientific interest . while subdominant at all energies , the focused cxb (  fcxb \" ) contributes noticeably below 15  kev  having roughly 10% the flux of the  aperture \" cxb  with a slightly softer spectrum than the  aperture \" cxb since it has been modulated by the mirror effective area , which begins to decline above 10  kev .",
    "although we directly measure the contribution of each component , we do not do so with infinite precision or accuracy .",
    "inaccurately estimated systematic offsets can easily lead to `` detections , ''",
    "especially when the associated precision of a component is overestimated .",
    "faint spectral components , such as ic emission in galaxy clusters , fall into in this category since they tend to reside in background - dominated regimes .",
    "therefore , we must have some sense of the systematic uncertainty intrinsic to the background , and as much as possible to each component of the background . for some components , like the internal background , the systematic uncertainty could in theory be arbitrarily close to 0% . in practice , of course , uncertainties of less than a few percent are difficult to achieve",
    ". components with a cosmic origin , however , have systematic uncertainty floors due to their very natures . while these uncertainties are sometimes large , they may also be well known , as in the case of the cxb .    at higher ( @xmath29  kev ) energies , where the internal background strongly dominates , performing the background fitting procedure outlined in appendix  [ sec : appendixsim ] on the first - pass ecdfs survey fields results in an accurate reconstruction of the background level with a standard deviation of @xmath30% after accounting for the effect of statistical fluctuations .",
    "although the real uncertainty may be smaller , the large statistical uncertainties due to the shorter exposure time ( @xmath27 ks / field ) make it difficult to surmise with greater precision .",
    "we adopt a conservative uncertainty of 3% for the entire energy range . because much of this regime is dominated by lines , whose normalizations have independent systematic uncertainties that are dwarfed by their statistical uncertainties , a global shift up or down maximizes this background s impact on fits to the cluster spectrum .",
    "the shape of the cxb spectrum has been well - measured by other missions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and although it may vary on small scales , the larger scales relevant to are unlikely to exhibit noticeable deviations from the average spectrum .",
    "the overall normalization , however , depends critically on the number of more rare , brighter sources , which varies from one location to another on the sky . because we have no way to exclude the brightest sources , even the variance on large scales ( 0.310 deg@xmath31/pixel over a total solid angle of 37.2 deg@xmath31 )",
    "can be high .",
    "we can eliminate much of this uncertainty by directly measuring it in the non - source regions of an observation .",
    "this technique is especially powerful thanks to the strong correlation of the cxb normalization between source and non - source regions .",
    "each cxb point source produces an aperture - shaped ( circular aperture stop opening modulated by any fraction blocked by the optics bench ) `` plateau '' of emission across the detectors , so many pixels  see \" the same sources seen by other pixels , especially those nearby",
    ". however , background and source regions will not contain all the same cxb sources , so a residual uncertainty remains .",
    "based on simulations of the @xmath32@xmath33 from @xcite , we find that for the approximate location of the cluster on the detectors the residual systematic for the aperture cxb is 8% ( @xmath34 )",
    ".    in principle , scattered and reflected x - rays ( contributing at the lowest energies ) should be nearly perfectly correlated between all pixels , even if their spatial distribution is not necessarily uniform . because we do not know exactly where the scattering is taking place , we can not predict the appearance of this emission like we can for the  aperture \" background .",
    "it does not appear to be flat ; independent fits of spectra from the various detectors give different normalizations .",
    "unfortunately , it is not yet feasible to empirically determine the shape any more finely than that at this time . based on the same exercise used to constrain the internal value ,",
    "we find a systematic uncertainty for the  solar \" component of 10% ( @xmath34 ) .    for the  fcxb \" emission , we can apply a straightforward shorthand estimate of cosmic variance , consistent with the method used for the  aperture \" component but based on an empirical estimate of the variance .",
    "we assume a conservative point source detection threshold of @xmath35 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 ( 2030  kev ) , below which individual sources would not be obvious embedded within the cluster emission ( see section  [ sec : analy : imgs ] for details ) .",
    "the variance scales as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the solid angle on the sky and @xmath38 is the flux limit for excised point sources . for our elliptical source region ,",
    "shown in figure  [ fig : imgs ] , @xmath39 arcmin@xmath31 .",
    "we can estimate the variance in our observation relative to another measurement assuming a @xmath32@xmath33 relation of @xmath40 . using the _",
    "heao-1 a2 _ estimate @xcite with @xmath41 , @xmath38(2030  kev ) @xmath42 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 , and @xmath43 ( 1@xmath44 )",
    ", we find a variance and thus systematic uncertainty of @xmath45% ( @xmath34 ) for our extraction region .",
    "since we want the total cluster flux , to first order we could simply use as large a region as possible and assume that includes all the emission .",
    "however , the psf wings cause a fraction of the flux to get redistributed far from its true origin on the sky , which results in some emission being scattered beyond the fov as defined by the detectors .",
    "detector gaps also miss flux , and one just happens to fall across the brightest part of the bullet during the second observation .",
    "these effects require careful correction so that the exposure across the field is accurate .    as mentioned in section  [ sec : obs ] , the arf for an extended source is created by averaging the vignetting function across the region , weighted by the distribution of events .",
    "extended source arfs are not additionally corrected for any source emission scattered out of the region through the wings of the psf . to get a proper total flux for the bullet cluster spectrum",
    ", we must take the psf and estimate the fraction of the total emission captured inside the region .",
    "this task is not entirely trivial since not only does the psf shape vary with off - axis angle , but the off - axis angle varies for any given position on the sky over the course of an observation",
    ". normally one could neglect the variation in shape , as it only becomes a measurable effect for large ( @xmath46 ) off - axis angles .",
    "because the placement of the cluster in the second observation results in large off - axis angles for its eastern parts , we include these minor adjustments to the psf shape .",
    "following @xcite , we can construct composite or effective psfs for our particular observations across the entire cluster , so that each position has an appropriate psf associated with it .",
    "now armed with a set of position - dependent psfs ( but not energy - dependent ) , the flux in the wings can be directly computed .",
    "note that the psf varies weakly as a function of energy ; below @xmath47  kev , the fwhm is up to 10% broader than it is at higher energies , although the encircled energy fraction within a radius of @xmath48 agrees to within a few percent at all energies .",
    "the latter behavior justifies our use of an energy - independent psf .",
    "ideally , we would like to take the true flux distribution from the cluster and convolve it with the psfs to estimate the redistributed fraction , but above @xmath8 7  kev is the only telescope capable of making a reliable image . to estimate the fraction of the total flux in the 320  kev energy range within our spectral extraction region , we generate psfs in a 25@xmath4928 grid ",
    "each position separated by 1 fwhm of 18 and roughly fit them to the a and b telescope images .",
    "the extraction region encompasses 95% of the intrinsic flux from the cluster , and a net @xmath50% of that is scattered out of the region by the psf .",
    "thus , in terms of total cluster emission , our spectrum captures @xmath51% of the total 320  kev flux . when comparing to past observations , our quoted model normalizations and fluxes",
    "would then be 10% lower ; however , the overall effective area given in the calibration used here is @xmath52% lower than that needed to match with xrt and epic fluxes , which means our fluxes should also be decreased 15% ( this adjustment is present in later caldb releases ) .",
    "since these corrections roughly cancel out , and given the uncertain nature of absolute calibration between telescopes , we do not further adjust the normalizations and fluxes derived from model fits to the spectra .",
    "although the goal of this paper is to determine the character of the hardest emission in the cluster , we must first confirm that no reasonably bright point sources contaminate that emission . unlike all previous observatories , s",
    "unprecedented spatial resolution at hard energies makes a task heretofore impossible as simple as examining the images .",
    "the pipeline - filtered event files are sufficiently processed to produce images , which can be done in arbitrary energy bands by further filtering on the pha column in , e.g. , xselect .",
    "however , calibrated images also require exposure - correction and background - subtraction ; the necessary images are generated from nuexpomap and nuskybgd , respectively .",
    "the latter is not part of the software distribution , but was developed independently as part of this work .",
    "( see appendices  [ sec : appendixbgd ] and [ sec : appendixsim ] ) .",
    "we create exposure maps at single energies for each band , which roughly correspond to the mean emission - weighted energy of the band .",
    "to mosaic the two epochs along with the data from both telescopes , we also need to correct for offsets due to the @xmath50uncertainty in the reconstructed astrometry .",
    "no obvious point sources appear within the fov , so we estimate the necessary shifts using the global distribution of the cluster emission and find slight offsets of 0 to 3 pixels relative to the first epoch s a telescope astrometry . because the 2.46pixels significantly oversample the psf , the final images are smoothed by 5 pixels , more consistent with the psf s fwhm of @xmath53 .",
    "images in four energy bands ( top : 38  kev , 815  kev ; bottom : 1530  kev , 30 - 40  kev ) are presented in figure  [ fig : imgs ] .",
    "the white ellipse shows the extraction region for spectra discussed in section  [ sec : analy : spec ] . from 38  kev ,",
    "the cluster resembles the or images blurred by the larger psf , except that the `` bullet '' to the west is relatively de - emphasized since it is composed of cooler ( @xmath54  kev ) gas than is the main subcluster ( @xmath55  kev ) and s response is more sensitive to harder emission in this band . above 8  kev ,",
    "the `` bullet '' essentially disappears , although the halo of shocked gas surrounding it is clearly visible .",
    "the cluster begins to approach the level of the background above 15  kev , and above 30  kev whatever detectable emission remains is highly background - dominated . while the overall morphology changes slightly with energy  a subject of a future paper  it does not deviate appreciably from what one would expect extrapolating a temperature map measured at energies @xmath56  kev , suggesting the origin of the @xmath57  kev emission is also mostly , if not entirely , thermal as well .    most critically , there is no indication of a background agn whose emission could masquerade as the non - thermal emission we are searching for .",
    "the bullet cluster is generally free of bright point sources ; the contribution of obvious point source emission in the 0.84  kev band from a 0.5 ms mosaic ( courtesy m. markevitch ) is @xmath58% of the total cluster emission , or a flux of roughly @xmath59 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 . of course",
    ", considering these sources alone does not protect us from contamination by absorbed or very hard sources .",
    "while there are no bright point sources in our images , s large psf makes it more difficult to distinguish point sources embedded within the diffuse cluster emission .",
    "we can estimate the approximate brightness of point sources that we would be able to identify visually by adding a fake source to the data and noting the flux above which the source becomes readily apparent .",
    "the resulting flux limit is likely higher than what might be achieved with wavdetect or some other point source identification method , but relying on simple visual inspection of images is straightforward and sufficient for these purposes . in images covering the entire relevant energy band ( 340  kev ) ,",
    "point sources would be clearly identified within a radius of @xmath26 if they are @xmath60% of the total cluster flux and @xmath19% outside this radius , corresponding to flux limits of 29 @xmath61 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 . at higher energies ,",
    "the signal - to - noise rapidly declines ; in the 2030  kev band point sources only become obvious when they have @xmath62% of the cluster emission at those energies , or @xmath63 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "these limits are roughly comparable , with the 5% limit above translating to a flux in the 2030  kev band of @xmath64 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 , assuming a power law spectrum with a typical photon index of 1.8 .",
    "note that the entire fov of is at least a factor of two smaller than the effective psf of the hxd - pin and bat instruments , further reducing the comparative chance of a point source contaminating the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : specraw ] displays the four raw spectra extracted with nuproducts from the elliptical region illustrated in figure  [ fig : imgs ]",
    ". the consistency between the four spectra demonstrate the very similar effective areas between the two telescopes , the shallow vignetting function below 20  kev ( the primary difference between the two epochs is the off - axis angle of the cluster centroid ) , and the stability of the background ( whose dominance coincides with the appearance of strong lines just above 20  kev ) .",
    "the detection of an excess above the thermal tail clearly depends critically on the reproducibility of the background . via the procedure",
    "discussed in detail in appendices  [ sec : appendixbgd ] and [ sec : appendixsim ] , we have an empirical model for what the background emission should be in this region , based on blank field observations , which has been fit to non - source regions from these observations .",
    "this is our best guess for the background spectrum of each observation and telescope , but it is only the most likely state of the background ; the actual background may be somewhat different given systematic and statistical uncertainties .",
    "a proper background should mimic the statistical impact of the actual background , having both the same area and exposure time of the source region .",
    "typical backgrounds are often taken from larger regions or longer exposures in order to minimize the impact of statistical fluctuations in background regions that could bias the background level in the source region .",
    "however , this procedure underestimates the background - subtracted error per channel since the true background suffers from larger statistical uncertainties , which is important wherever the background dominates .    one solution is to jointly fit the background and source data together , but this requires simultaneously fitting 20 spectra each with 3675 unbinnned channels , making it computationally challenging just to find a good fit let alone calculate errors on parameter values . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we separate the background and source modeling phases but attempt to retain a statistically appropriate treatment of the background .",
    "as described in appendix  [ sec : appendixsim ] , a nominal background model is found for the source region for each epoch and telescope .",
    "we then simulate , for the same exposure time , a background for the region from this model using fakeit in xspec , including poisson fluctuations .",
    "of course , the resulting background spectra fail to incorporate any systematic offsets from the nominal model , and statistical fluctuations introduced to the spectrum have the potential to bias fit parameters as well .",
    "although not the only path forward , we choose to simulate many realizations of the four backgrounds , fitting the spectra with each set .",
    "this procedure naturally allows systematic uncertainties to be incorporated as well , since the several background component model normalizations can be randomly varied to reflect those uncertainties .",
    "each background thus represents a possible version of the true background , ideally in proportion to the likelihood that it matches the true background .",
    "a similar approach was taken to incorporate background systematic uncertainties in @xcite .",

    "binned to just above the gaussian limit ( 25 - 30 counts / bin ) , the @xmath65 statistic is known to be biased , especially for fits using a large number of bins @xcite .",
    "briefly , the weights @xmath66 on bins with negative fluctuations are overestimated while bins with positive fluctuations are underestimated , since @xmath67 , so the @xmath65 statistic drives the global best - fit model below the data .",
    "the model derived from fits to the background spectra , for example , are biased by 23% when @xmath65 is used as the fit statistic . to avoid this and similar issues with fitting the bullet cluster spectra",
    ", we use the xspec command statistic cstat , which applies the w statistic , a cash - like statistic appropriate for fits with unmodeled background spectra .",
    "bins with no counts have a tendency to confuse the implementation of this statistic in xspec , so we also group the spectra such that there are at least 3 counts in each bin in _ both _ data and background spectra .",
    "armed with a reliable way to deal with the background , we can confidently evaluate the nature of the hardest detectable emission from the bullet cluster .",
    "a strong motivation for these observations was to confirm and better characterize the non - thermal component claimed in @xcite .",
    "in clusters with radio halos and relics , such as the bullet cluster , ic emission  the only diffuse interpretation for",
    "a non - thermal tail  must be present at some level .",
    "if the ic emission is bright and begins to dominate the spectrum over the thermal emission at a low enough energy , then the spectrum will be trivial to model .",
    "the characterization of a weaker ic component , however , depends much more on the model employed to discriminate it from the thermal emission .",
    "of course , our spectrum falls within the latter regime .",
    "the range of models considered is somewhat restricted , but appropriate for the data , consisting of single temperature ( 1 t ) , two temperature ( 2 t ) , and single temperature plus power law ( t+ic ) components . the thermal components are calculated using the version of the @xcite plasma code implemented in xspec .",
    "the 1 t model provides the simplest possible description of the spectrum .",
    "emission dominated by isothermal or nearly isothermal gas will be satisfactorily characterized with a single temperature component , since s 0.4  kev fwhm resolution does not allow us to easily separate the k@xmath68 line complexes near he - like and h - like fe at 6.7 and 6.9  kev , respectively .",
    "therefore , we are entirely reliant on the shape of the largely featureless continuum to discern multi - temperature gas . given our broad bandpass ( 330  kev ) , the 1 t model is unlikely to account for all the truly thermal emission . from and ,",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy clearly demonstrates that the icm contains gas spanning a large range of temperatures @xcite , which one would expect for an ongoing merger @xcite .",
    "we do not know the true temperature structure , however , only the emission - weighted line - of - sight projected temperature distribution , which is also folded through the effective area and is thus dependent on the calibration and energy band .",
    "for the global spectrum , we are not particularly concerned with describing the true temperature structure , since that is not possible .",
    "instead , we wish to accurately represent the part of the temperature distribution seen by , which is more heavily weighted toward the hotter regions and thus may not entirely agree with the projected temperature structure measured within a lower energy bandpass .",
    "because thermal continua are fairly featureless , the 2 t model will likely encompass the full range of significant gas temperatures .",
    "if the ic emission is sufficiently bright , however , then the higher temperature component of the 2 t model will be skewed to an unphysically high value . in this case",
    ", the t+ic model should provide a better description of the overall spectrum .",
    "although the thermal component would be imperfectly suited to the true thermal distribution , the harder non - thermal component would better capture the spectral shape at higher energies .",
    "note that the statistical power resides at low energies where the majority of counts are , so the non - thermal excess at high energies must be sufficiently strong to overcome the worsening of the fit quality at the low end .    for the non - thermal component of the t+ic model , we fix the power law photon index to 1.86 , the best - fit value found by @xcite .",
    "we also allowed the index to be a free parameter , but in nearly all cases the index became steeper ( @xmath69 ) , where it was most likely mimicking the lower temperature component of the 2 t model .",
    "this appropriating of the ic component directly results from the greater statistical power of the counts at the low end of the energy range driving the fit .",
    "although the radio synchrotron spectrum basically agrees with this best - fit index , implying @xmath70 for the ic index @xcite , the electrons producing the radio emission are more energetic ( for @xmath71 @xmath7 g , @xmath72 23,000 where @xmath73 is the `` relativistic gamma '' of the electron ) than the ones producing the ic ( @xmath74 at 30  kev ) , so there is no guarantee the photon index would directly follow , and there is good reason to assume the index flattens at lower energies as is seen in , e.g. , the coma cluster @xcite . for comparison purposes and for our primary result , we choose to fix @xmath75 , which is similar to the typically assumed value of @xmath76 in any case .",
    "typical fits to the four spectra , using a background spectrum generated from the nominal background model , illustrate the subtle differences between the 1 t , 2 t , and t+ic descriptions of the bullet cluster s spectrum in figures  [ fig : specallmodels ] and [ fig : specratio ] .",
    "( note : all uncertainties quoted in this subsection are purely statistical and are derived using the the nominal backgrounds displayed in the above figures . ) in each of these figures , the data , backgrounds , and models for the four spectra have been grouped together for clarity , although the models are folded through each response separately during the fit .",
    "the background is also shown to highlight where the spectrum becomes dominated by the background . to zeroth order ,",
    "the 1 t fit is quite good , with a typical @xmath77 .",
    "the global temperature of @xmath78  kev agrees quite well with the acceptable best - fit temperature range of 13.6  kev @xmath79  kev @xcite , which varies depending on the value of @xmath80 used .",
    "although higher than the best - fit global temperature of @xmath81  kev @xcite , we would expect the average temperature in the 330  kev band to be slightly higher than measured in the 110  kev band .",
    "the and temperature disagreement almost certainly comes down to their respective calibrations , e.g. , @xcite . despite the somewhat coarse spectral resolution around the fe lines ,",
    "the large effective area and exposure time allows the abundance to be well constrained at @xmath82 of solar , consistent with those determined from previous observatories , such as ( @xmath83 , * ? ? ?",
    "although a 1 t model can largely explain the detected emission , a very slight curvature in the residuals of the fit indicates that the spectrum is not of a truly isothermal plasma .",
    "because our sensitivity extends up to higher energies , we can test whether that extra curvature is more likely to come from the true multi - temperature structure of the cluster or an ic component .",
    "the 2 t model approximates what is actually a fairly smooth , somewhat bimodal , temperature distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the best fit thermal components in this model only roughly correspond to the actual temperatures .",
    "even so , the temperatures we find for the two components are reasonable , with @xmath84  kev and @xmath85  kev",
    ". figure  [ fig : specallmodels ] shows the relative importance of the fainter component , with the lower temperature accounting for only @xmath50% of the 330  kev flux .",
    "the hard spectral tail up to 30  kev is fully consistent with a thermal spectrum of @xmath86  kev , only a little higher than the ambient , non-``bullet '' icm temperature of @xmath87  kev seen with @xcite and the 14.2  kev temperature found here with the 1 t model . given that at a minimum there is recently shocked gas at much higher temperatures @xcite , a rise in @xmath88 of this magnitude is not surprising . also , the range in temperatures for @xmath89 agrees very well with temperatures common in both the `` bullet '' region and nearby @xcite .",
    "lastly , we evaluate the likelihood of an ic excess at high energies with the t+ic model .",
    "the near success of the 1 t model suggests that if a detectable ic component lies at harder energies , the thermal emission should be well accounted for by a single temperature component .",
    "we again find a very reasonable temperature of @xmath90  kev , and the resulting 50100  kev ic flux is @xmath91 ergs s@xmath4 cm@xmath31 .",
    "again , the thermal component is entirely consistent with that found with previous observatories .",
    "the ic flux , on the other hand , falls nearly a factor of 3 below the expected value of @xmath93 ergs s@xmath4 cm@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the best - fit ic component only surpasses the thermal component at @xmath94  kev , where the cluster emission becomes so faint it is lost in statistical fluctuations of the background . to first order",
    ", the spectrum appears equally well - fit by the addition of a non - thermal model as by the addition of another thermal model , and the statistical significance of the ic component is possibly high enough to warrant a detection .",
    "the inclusion of systematic uncertainties and a detailed comparison of the 2 t and t+ic fitting results outlined in the following subsection , however , preclude us from making such a claim .",
    "the mean parameter values and statistical errors were reported in section  [ sec : analy : spec : fits ] ; however , true uncertainty ranges must include the impact of both statistical and systematic fluctuations in the background on the fits .",
    "the distribution of best - fit temperatures for the three models  found using 1000 realizations of the background for our 4 spectra  are shown in figure  [ fig : ktdist ] , immediately illustrating the impact of both background uncertainties and the model we choose to use on our ability to evaluate the spectrum . when the shape of the model is determined by one parameter , as in the 1 t case , background uncertainties have only a slight effect on the temperature , creating a spread of only 0.18  kev ( compared to the statistical uncertainty of @xmath95  kev ) . adding another parameter that more finely controls the broadband shape of the model ( 2 t or t+ic cases ) allows background fluctuations to play a more significant role . for the 2 t model , the best - fit temperatures for each component  shown in green in the main panel and inset panel of figure  [ fig : ktdist ]  are much more sensitive to background fluctuations than in either the 1 t or t+ic cases , mostly owing to the greater flexibility of the model to adjust to small changes in the shape of the spectrum .",
    "background variations primarily affect the @xmath88 component , since a slightly higher / lower background will cause the spectrum to turn over at a lower / higher energy , thus pushing @xmath88 to lower / higher values .",
    "the @xmath89 component then adjusts to `` correct '' the low energy part of the spectrum ; the two temperatures are strongly correlated for a given fit , such that a higher than typical @xmath88 will have a higher than typical @xmath89 .    in the t+ic model , the temperature component dominates at all relevant energies and thus maintains the precision of the 1 t model s temperature ( despite having a larger statistical error of 0.35  kev )",
    ". the ic flux , in principle , should be much more sensitive to background systematics than to statistical uncertainties , for the simple reason that its shape more closely matches the background and any systematic shift up or down of the background will correspondingly shift the ic normalization .",
    "tellingly , the uncertainty due to the background on the ic flux ( @xmath96 ergs s@xmath4 cm@xmath31 , 50100  kev ) is slightly less than its statistical uncertainty ( @xmath97 ergs s@xmath4 cm@xmath31 ) .",
    "a true non - thermal excess at high energies should be more affected by background fluctuations .",
    "since the ic flux is not , it is likely driven more by `` correcting '' ( as in the 2 t case ) the model shape at lower energies , where the signal - to - noise is higher .",
    "the ic component is not accounting for truly non - thermal flux in these fits ; instead , it substitutes for additional thermal components missing from the single temperature model , likely at both the high _ and _ low energy ends of the spectrum . allowing the ic photon index to be",
    "a free parameter further confirms this explanation . for the nominal background , the index steepens to @xmath98 and mirrors the contribution of the @xmath89 component of the 2 t model at low energies , where its continuum shape is nearly identical to that of a @xmath50  kev plasma .",
    "as shown by the cyan histograms in figure  [ fig : ktdist ] , the temperature of the thermal component in this t+ic model is actually hotter than for the 1 t case .",
    "the hard emission is modeled entirely by the thermal component , while the ic appears to be mimicking the @xmath89 component .",
    "this argument alone does not invalidate the ic hypothesis , since in principle the gas could be sufficiently isothermal to allow ic emission to be contributing excess flux at lower energies where the component is mostly being constrained , and it is only coincidental that the spectrum runs out of counts just when the ic component begins to dominate the hard emission . assuming this viewpoint",
    ", a combination of the statistical and systematic uncertainties gives a most likely ic flux of @xmath99 ergs s@xmath4 cm@xmath31 , or a positive fluctuation of less than 2@xmath44 .",
    "considering we have strong reason to believe this component is thermal in nature , it is clear we do not detect ic emission in the global bullet cluster spectrum with .",
    "the results for each model , including statistical and systematic uncertainties , are summarized in table  [ tab : fit ] .",
    "even so , the t+ic model may fit the spectrum better than the 2 t model , in which case we might still argue that the spectrum shows evidence of an ic component .",
    "the relative quality of the t+ic versus 2 t fits depends on the background realization being used , and figure  [ fig : delcstat ] demonstrates that certain backgrounds do in fact favor the t+ic over the 2 t model . in this figure , the fits with the 1000 background realizations have been binned according to the difference in c - statistic values between these two models , with values to the right of the vertical lines favoring the 2 t model and values to their left favoring the t+ic model . the solid histogram / vertical line correspond to fits with @xmath100 fixed to a value of 1.86 and the dashed versions to fits with @xmath100 as a free parameter . in the majority of background realizations ,",
    "the 2 t model is preferred , and in only 1.2% of them can the same be said for the t+ic model where @xmath100 is fixed . the t+ic model is favored 7.6% of the time when @xmath100 is free , although in this case the ic component may simply be mimicking a second thermal component .",
    "so while it is most likely the case that the spectrum can best be characterized with a pure thermal model , we can not rule out an ic flux within the range of fluxes in the right panel of figure  [ fig : ktdist ] .",
    "based on this analysis , a fair 90% upper limit on the ic flux should correctly incorporate both the systematic and statistical uncertainties already discussed . to capture the fact that the t+ic fits prefer a non - zero ic flux , we sum the mean flux with the quadrature - summed uncertainties , yielding an upper limit of @xmath3 ergs s@xmath4 cm@xmath31 in the 50100  kev band .",

    "we therefore conclude that no significant non - thermal emission has been detected in the observations of the bullet cluster and place an upper limit on the ic flux of @xmath3 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 ( 50100  kev ) .",
    "this flux falls below that reported by and .      as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , @xcite first suggested the existence of significant ic emission at hard energies in the bullet cluster based on a joint analysis of and spectra .",
    "the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath127 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 ( 50100  kev ) is too large to justify a claim of detection .",
    "however , a more recent analysis @xcite , using a bat spectrum found a flux of @xmath128 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 ( 50100  kev ) , roughly consistent with that from @xcite .",
    "both fluxes are only barely in conflict with our conservative upper limit , but our most likely ic flux of @xmath129 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath5 ( 50100  kev ) is clearly inconsistent with these previous measurements .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy has two potential explanations : either the spectra from the various instruments disagree ; or the approach to modeling the spectra disagree .",
    "while even minor calibration differences between the characterization of the telescope responses and of the backgrounds can significantly affect results , a comparison of the , , and spectra fit to 1 t or 2 t models implies these are not responsible .",
    "none of the instruments on these satellites reliably detect emission above 30  kev from the bullet , and below this energy there is no compelling excess above a reasonable thermal - only model in figure  2 of @xcite , the lower left panel of figure  5 of @xcite , or figure  [ fig : specallmodels ] of this paper . at higher energies",
    ", the background dominates the count rate and its treatment becomes crucial , where even small fluctuations can result in a false ic signal .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to evaluate the backgrounds from the other two missions , but no causes for worry are evident in the analyses of the and data .",
    "if the spectra are all consistent with each other , we must attribute the conflicting conclusions to differences in how the spectra are modeled . in principle",
    "there should be no difference , since 1 t , 2 t , and t+ic models are each tried in all three analyses . the crucial distinction between them is the minimum energy used in the fits : 1  kev @xcite , 0.5  kev @xcite , or 3  kev ( this work ) .",
    "the lower end of the energy range matters because the thermal gas of the bullet cluster is decidedly _ not _ isothermal @xcite , and the fraction of the emission any temperature component contributes strongly varies with energy , with low temperature components dominating at soft energies but essentially disappearing from the hard band .",
    "merging clusters , especially those like the bullet where one subcluster hosts a cool core , may have components of roughly equal emission measure that span a factor of two in temperature .",
    "in particular , the emission coming from the cool core ranges from @xmath130  kev up to 7  kev , has a higher abundance , and mostly contributes at the lowest energies .",
    "the gas associated with the main subcluster is hotter , with a central @xmath131 kev and shocked regions to the w and also to the slight se with @xmath132  kev ( m. markevitch , priv .",
    "comm . ) . given the extreme range in temperatures , even a 2 t model may provide an insufficient description of the data over a broad energy range .",
    "ironically , the t@xmath125ic model might better fit the _",
    "purely thermal _ emission more successfully in this case , since a power law with free photon index is able to simultaneously account for emission from components at either extreme of the temperature distribution ( e.g. , a3112 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    by including data below 3  kev in order to better constrain the thermal component , in all likelihood",
    "the larger consequence is to bias the characterization of the thermal component , since only simple spectral models are considered . because the response of s epic instruments peaks between 12  kev and shot noise , which has a fractional error decreasing with energy , sets the signal - to - noise ratio , fit minimization routines are overly biased to find good fits at these lower energies . the second model in the multi - component fits of @xcite , from this perspective ,",
    "are focused on artificially `` fixing '' the residuals below 1 or 2  kev with either the second temperature or ic component , and the slope of the ic s photon index is determined mostly by the data alone , given that the t@xmath125ic model over - predicts almost every bat data point .",
    "this explanation is less compelling for the @xmath125analysis of @xcite . in this case , the fact that fits to both the ( over 110  kev ) and ( over 330  kev ) yield the same temperature despite the different energy bands is worrisome ; given the multi - temperature structure , one would expect the 310  kev temperature from to be hotter than this average , and the 310  kev temperature from to be cooler or unchanged .",
    "in contrast , the temperatures in our 2 t model roughly agree with the approximately bimodal temperature distribution seen with , lending credence to the still imperfect thermal model approximated with only two components .",
    "the much improved spectral resolution of over that of and undoubtedly helps the fit find physical temperatures . for the t@xmath125ic model ,",
    "when the photon index is left free , it tends toward a somewhat larger or steeper value where it only influences the lowest energy channels .",
    "the ic component , when exhibiting this behavior , mimics a lower temperature thermal component more than it tries to account for any excess emission at high energies , further refuting the existence of a significant non - thermal excess .    by combining the synchrotron spectrum at radio frequencies with an ic estimate or upper limit",
    ", we can directly constrain the volume averaged magnetic field strength . following the arguments and expression for @xmath9 in equation  14 of @xcite",
    ", we use the total radio halo flux of 78 mjy at 1300 mhz and a radio spectral index of 1.21.4 @xcite .",
    "the radio spectrum exhibits no flattening at lower frequencies as in @xcite for the coma cluster , so we assume the spectrum continues as a power law to lower frequencies where the electron population producing the synchrotron is the same as those producing the ic .",
    "the upper limit on ic emission translates to a lower limit on the magnetic field strength of @xmath6 @xmath7 g , which is comparable to values found in other clusters using and data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unlike estimates of @xmath1330.2 @xmath7 g , such lower limits are more consistent with equipartition estimates ( @xmath8 1 @xmath7 g for the bullet cluster , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and faraday rotation measure estimates in other clusters , which typically place the field strength at a few @xmath7 g ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while it is possible to reconcile these estimates with a lower volume averaged value of @xmath9 , our lower limit does not requires it .      in order to detect diffuse , faint ic emission in galaxy clusters",
    ", the ic signal must be teased from both thermal and instrumental `` backgrounds , '' both of which are likely to be brighter than the ic emission itself .",
    "while going to harder energies reduces contaminating emission from the thermal gas , it requires a large effective area at high energies and/or low and well - characterized instrumental and/or cosmic backgrounds . regarding the background , focusing optics like those onboard have clear advantages over non - focusing ones , such as collimators and coded - mask telescopes . the effective area or equivalent sensitivity , however , remains a greater challenge for reflective optics due to the large number  and thus weight  of mirror shells needed .",
    "ic photon intensity also declines rapidly with energy , making it exceedingly difficult to detect such emission at high energies given the statistical fluctuations of a realistic background level without a very large effective area .",
    "in the foreseeable future , ic emission in hot clusters will only be detectable as a subtle inflection of the thermal tail .",
    "such non - thermal inflections , however , are complicated by having plausible alternative origins , such as background agn , clumps of super hot gas , and slightly underestimated overall backgrounds .",
    "these difficulties , combined with magnetic field equipartition estimates nearly an order of magnitude larger than the field strengths inferred by ic measurements , emphasize the need for a conservative approach .",
    "the recent history of ic searches seems to justify this view .",
    "@xcite nicely summarizes some , , , and detections and upper limits in their figure  10 , which shows that clusters may exhibit an ic signal in the dataset of one observatory but not another  sometimes , but not often , contradictorily .",
    "the reasons behind these differences are not always clear , but likely include some combination of relative instrumental calibration , background treatment , and telescope capabilities .",
    "detections are only mildly statistically significant and are in danger of being compromised by the complications mentioned above .",
    "the clusters expected to host ic - producing electrons are those undergoing mergers , which produce  possibly extreme ",
    "multi - temperature distributions .",
    "such distributions should in principle be straightforward to separate from a non - thermal component , _ if _ the ic component begins to dominate the spectrum at an energy where the signal - to - noise is sufficiently high , including systematic uncertainties .",
    "for the bullet cluster , we reach this point around 2030  kev .",
    "the next mission capable of detecting ic emission associated with radio halos is _ astro - h _ , which will include a hard x - ray telescope ( hxt ) and imager ( hxi ) , with a sensitivity similar to , as well as substantial soft x - ray capabilities with the soft x - ray imager ( sxi ) and x - ray calorimeter spectrometer ( xcs ) .",
    "although the hxi alone provides for no improvement over , the sxi and especially the xcs should allow for a more detailed and complete accounting of the thermal components of target clusters through emission line diagnostics .",
    "a better understanding of the thermal continuum will make marginal non - thermal - like excesses at hard energies more significant and upper limits more constraining .",
    "if the average magnetic field strength in galaxy clusters hosting radio halos is typically closer to @xmath26 @xmath7 g than the @xmath134 @xmath7 g implied by past detections , even _",
    "astro - h _ is unlikely to be enough of a technical advance . because the ratio of synchrotron to ic flux scales with the energy density of the of the magnetic field ( @xmath135 ) , a @xmath136 stronger @xmath9 requires a @xmath137 more sensitive telescope than currently exists .",
    "ic emission at this level would only compete with the thermal emission of a bullet - like cluster between 3050  kev , and given how faint the cluster is at these energies relative to the background ( e.g. , figures  [ fig : specallmodels ] and [ fig : specsig ] ) , it is likely that most of the sensitivity gain will come from increasing the effective area .",
    "an increase in effective area over of not quite an order of magnitude would be achieved by the proposed probe class _ hex - p _ mission , so a substantial decrease in background and its systematic uncertainty would still be necessary .    in terms of past ic detections",
    ", it may be the case that what has been measured is not ic emission associated with large scale radio halos . instead of being associated with the electrons producing radio halos and relics ,",
    "the ic emission might originate from electrons accelerated by accretion shocks at the virial radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . non - imaging telescopes  unlike  would pick up this emission , which peaks in surface brightness @xmath138 mpc from cluster centers . given our restricted extraction region around the bullet cluster , we are not sensitive to these electrons .",
    "however , the fov does partially include the virial region , where we characterized the background , so in principle this ic emission could exist at very faint levels ; a cursory check for a non - thermal component was made when the background was fit , but no such signal beyond the generic background model was apparent .",
    "note that these observations are not ideally suited for searches of this emission , which would be better served by several offset pointings around the periphery of the cluster .",
    "even so , the emission would be strongest at the low energy end , where we attribute extra flux detected in the background regions to scattered thermal photons .",
    "it should be feasible to constrain these models , but only after a more detailed accounting of the bullet cluster s thermal structure has been undertaken , in order to separate local emission from scattered photons from various regions in the cluster .",

    "the benches containing the optics and detectors are separated on two ends of an unenclosed mast . pointing variations throughout a given observation cause a given detector pixel to sample several times more sky than without this wobble . because the light path is open to space , stray light from the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) is able to skirt between the optics bench and the aperture stops in front of the two focal planes ( figure  [ fig : app : geometry ] ) ; the geometry of this window produces highly non - uniform background gradients across the detectors at low energy ( @xmath139  kev ) . at the lowest energies , scattered solar x - rays reflected from other parts of the observatory structure are visible to the detectors , due to its open design .",

    ", there is a strong , soft additional component ( `` solar '' ) that is most likely due to reflected solar x - rays as evidenced by its persistence in spectra from earth observations when the satellite is illuminated by the sun and its absence when not .",
    "this component can undergo significant fluctuations due to solar activity .",
    "although thought to come primarily from reflections off the backside of the aperture stop , this conjecture has yet to be confirmed and thus we have no way to predict the spatial pattern it produces on the detectors , but it is likely non - uniform as well .",
    "the other low energy contributor to the background is from the cxb `` focused '' by the optics (  fcxb \" ) .",
    "the  fcxb \" includes both truly focused events ( photons reflected off of both mirrors ) and scattered events or ghost rays ( photons reflecting off of only one mirror ) from the many unresolved sources both within and outside the fov .",
    "its shape is roughly flat across the detector plane despite vignetting due to an increase in scattered light from sources outside the fov at larger off - axis angles .    above @xmath52@xmath141",
    "kev , the internal or instrumental background dominates .",
    "it is made up of gamma rays compton scattered by the detector and shield , lines activated by interactions between the spacecraft / detectors and the radiation environment in orbit , and a few fluorescence lines .",
    "most of the lines are driven by frequent  if glancing ",
    "passages through the saa , when protons activate material in the focal plane module near or in the detectors .",
    "unstable elements are created by proton spallation and secondary neutron capture by cadmium , which then radioactively decay with half - lives typically longer than s orbital period .",
    "the strongest of these activation lines appear in the complex from 2225  kev .",
    "while the strengths of these lines depend on the spacecraft s recent orbital history , there is as yet no evidence for spatial variations across individual detectors , and the relative strength of a given line between detectors  which depends on properties unique to each detector such as its thickness  does not vary .",
    "the strongest instrumental lines are due to k - shell fluorescence of cesium and iodine at 28  kev and 31  kev , respectively , residing in the anti - coincidence shield .",
    "the continuum , meant to represent the compton scattered component and any other featureless instrumental components , is modeled as a broken power law with a break at 124  kev .",
    "the lines and line complexes are modeled with 29 lorentzian - profile lines , _ empirically _ added to the spectra in figure  [ fig : app : stack ] until the fit can no longer be reasonably improved .",
    "initially , the line energies and widths , which are tied between the a and b spectra , are allowed some freedom during the fitting process  as is the temperature describing the `` solar '' component and the indices of the internal continuum  but at some arbitrary point the model is deigned to be `` good enough '' and those parameters fixed thereafter .",
    "the internal ( and perhaps `` solar '' ) components exhibit no detectable spatial variation within individual detectors , but they do between detectors .",
    "to first order , the cxb has a constant surface brightness across the sky .",
    "the intensity detected by a given pixel thus depends on the solid angle of visible sky , which is solely a function of the observatory s geometry .",
    "each pixel `` sees '' a solid angle of @xmath126 deg@xmath31 defined by the circular aperture stop .",
    "the view is blocked , however , by the apparent position of the optics bench , which depends on the location of the pixel in the focal plane , so the level of cxb flux smoothly varies across the detectors . despite understanding this geometry ,",
    "the absolute position of the focal plane detectors in the bench is uncertain at the 1  mm level . also , just as for the `` solar '' component , cxb emission from the entire rear hemisphere of the sky",
    " except that blocked by the earth  can be scattered by the backside of the aperture stop and other parts of the observatory into the focal plane , thus modulating its spatial distribution .",
    "using cxb focal plane maps generated by ray traces through the observatory s geometry , we can adjust the precise position of the detectors within the focal plane and the proportion of unmodulated , scattered cxb flux until we obtain a good match to stacked images from the blank sky observations .    to isolate the `` aperture '' component ,",
    "we stack 715  kev images from all the observations in detector ( det1 ) coordinates , which has a finer spatial resolution than the native pixels ( possible due to probability distribution functions relating to event grades obtained from pencil - beam ground calibrations ) ; the stacked images are shown in the left panels of figure  [ fig : app : det1im ] .",
    "the 40@xmath4940 mm detector plane is binned into cells with sides 2 to 4 mm long and fit to the ray trace model using the @xmath65 statistic and minimization package mpfit @xcite .",
    "in addition to fitting for the `` aperture '' model @xmath142 and @xmath143 positions and normalizations , we also include simple spatial models for the internal , `` solar , '' and `` fcxb '' components , the normalizations of which are allowed to vary .",
    "the relative flux assigned to each component is initially inconsistent with the expectation from figure  [ fig : app : stack ] , when the  aperture \" spectral component only includes direct emission through the aperture stop . to reconcile the spatial and spectral  aperture \" models ,",
    "the spatial model requires extra flat emission of uncertain origin .",
    "one possibility is that earth albedo or cxb photons are scattered off of the backside of the aperture stop and elsewhere and into the detector housing .",
    "spectra extracted during earth - occulted periods , for example , exhibit a component below 15  kev with the same spectral shape as the `` aperture '' component , even though the cxb is not directly visible ( see figure  [ fig : app : solar ] ) .",
    "alternatively , a contributor to the internal continuum component may rise with decreasing energy instead of following the simple power law spectrum we assume .",
    "the spectral shape of this component is hard to predict , and we make no attempt to do so , so such a rise is very plausible and would be consistent with it being spatially flat . for simplicity , the spatial model of the `` aperture '' component",
    "is modified to include this extra emission , rather than adjusting the spectral shape of internal continuum .",
    "the amount of extra emission added is increased until we achieve self - consistency between spectral and spatial fits to the data without large shifts in the position of the detectors .",
    "we also performed simultaneous spectro - spatial fits of similarly binned regions , and while they are the most comprehensive , they are too computationally intensive and fickle to arrive at best - fit detector offsets and extra `` aperture '' emission . however , these fits were useful to explore the parameter space , as were fits to the full fov spectra , informing the level to which each component should contribute to the 715  kev images .",
    "this iterative procedure results in extra ",
    "aperture \" fractions of 13% for each focal plane and position offsets of ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) and ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 ) in ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) for a and b , respectively .",
    "these exact values are irrelevant as long as the `` aperture '' shape is correct ; they only matter if one wants to extract an absolute flux for the cxb using this data . the model created with these values",
    "is shown in the right panels of figure  [ fig : app : det1im ] .      because the origin of the `` aperture '' component of the background is well understood , we were able to characterize its variation across the fov with high confidence .",
    "the spatial distribution of the two other cosmic sources  `` fcxb '' and `` solar ''  of the background have yet to be as well - constrained .",
    "although the `` fcxb '' distribution can in principle be simulated , at the time of this writing the model of the mirror modules is still being refined to account for observed ghost ray patterns .",
    "( ghost rays are photons typically scattered by the optics , usually once - reflected , from sources within @xmath148 of the optical axis . )",
    "the pre - launch model predicts a distribution somewhat following the vignetting function ; however , the blank sky fields show no evidence of such a spatial modulation . observed ghost ray patterns produced by bright sources near to but outside the fov show an additional halo farthest from the source , likely due to reflections off the back sides of the mirrors .",
    "the extra contribution due to this halo from cxb sources outside the fov may act to compensate for the drop in flux from higher off - axis sources within the fov . empirically , the spatial shape of the `` fcxb '' is consistent with a flat distribution , although due to its relative faintness it is difficult to discern otherwise .",
    "we assume a flat distribution hereafter for simplicity .",
    "the `` solar '' component has only recently been recognized as originating from the sun through reflections off the observatory structure .",
    "no study of its likely spatial distribution has been undertaken , and in any case the distribution may vary with sun angle . to allow for spatial variations ,",
    "we treat the `` solar '' continuum and associated 3.5  kev and 4.5  kev lines as if they had an instrumental origin and thus should only vary between detectors and not within them .",
    "although this treatment amounts to a very coarsely defined spatial model , this component is typically only important below 5  kev where sources are brightest .",
    "we note , however , that x - ray emission from the sun is highly variable and that during flares this component can dominate up to 10  kev ; such periods are not currently handled by the background model described here , since the spectrum itself is likely to evolve from the quiescent one we include .",
    "when data are split between the periods that the spacecraft is and is not illuminated by the sun , the correlation between the soft emission and a solar origin is clear , as shown in the examples in figure  [ fig : app : solar ] , the four panels of which also demonstrate its variability .    in contrast",
    ", the components of the background with an instrumental origin should not depend on position within the fov , as long as the detectors are all uniform and identical .",
    "consisting of single cdznte crystals , each individual detector should be very close to uniform , which agrees with the lack of spatial fluctuations across any given detector in the stacked high energy images of the blank sky fields .",
    "the detectors are not identical , however , and the variation between them in thickness and charge transport properties lead to slight differences in overall background level and line strengths . for any given observation ,",
    "the overall level and strengths depend on the orbital history through the south atlantic anomaly and other higher radiation zones .",
    "since all the detectors share this history , the _ relative _ strengths of the internal components should always be the same . to complete our empirical spectro - spatial model of the background",
    ", we simply need to determine the ratios between these components for the detectors on each of the two focal planes .",
    "we separate each full fov spectrum from figure  [ fig : app : stack ] into four spectra corresponding to each detector , which each share the same spectral model shapes . having previously determined the `` aperture '' and `` fcxb '' model spatial shapes , the relative proportion of their flux falling on each detector",
    "is fixed appropriately , but all other model normalizations are left free .",
    "the four spectra are then fit simultaneously , and independently for each telescope , and the resulting fits are shown in figure  [ fig : app4det ] .",
    "many of the lines have similar strengths on each detector , but that is not universally true .",

    "given these assumptions , one can directly measure a `` local '' background for any subset of the fov and use that to accurately predict the background for anywhere in the entire fov .",
    "the quality of the background is of course limited by the statistics available in the observation used to constrain the background model , but one advantage of separating out the different components is that separate systematic uncertainties associated with each component can be applied individually .",
    "now that we have a background model , we can use the events far from the cluster to determine the precise level of each background component , which are unique to the conditions of these observations . to apply the model defined in appendix  [ sec : appendixbgd ]",
    ", we have developed a small suite of idl routines called nuskybgd , whose purpose is to take regions defined in sky coordinates , compute the relative strengths of each background component based on their location in the detector plane , and create an xspec - readable script that sets up and fits for all observation - specific component normalizations , much in the spirit of the background treatment in the extended source analysis software package ( as introduced in * ? ? ?",
    "those normalizations correspond to a complete spectro - spatial background model from which images in any energy band or spectra for any region can be produced .    in principle",
    ", we could extract a single spectrum of the non - cluster part of the fov for each telescope and epoch and fit the model to that .",
    "the downside of this approach is that all spatial information is lost , which can cause the various components  especially the `` aperture '' component  to obtain unphysical best - fit normalizations . to incorporate this information",
    "while also keeping the computational load to a minimum , we divide the non - cluster area into four rectangular regions for each focal plane and epoch , shown in figure  [ fig : bgdreg ] .",

    "the `` fcxb '' component , being the unresolved contribution of sources in that region of the sky , will be identical for telescopes a and b as long as the regions are roughly coincident . similarly , because the roll angle is very similar between the two epochs , the part of the sky producing the `` aperture '' component for each telescope is almost entirely identical . fitting all 16 spectra simultaneously therefore permits the normalizations of these parameters to be appropriately tied together , reducing the number of free parameters and the chance that any component gets pushed to an unphysical value by preventing the fit from heading down a local minimum .",
    "we pursue this strategy because below @xmath52  kev all of the background components contribute at non - negligible levels , making it easier for the fit minimization procedure to be misled by mere statistical fluctuations .    despite having a conservative exclusion region around the cluster",

    "`` fcxb '' components turn out to be very similar , which means that if both were left free they may very well take on unphysical values . even under these circumstances , however , the overall background model should not suffer , since the scattered component is not included in it and the `` fcxb '' normalization , while on average constant across the fov , can significantly vary location - to - location due to cosmic variance . as that flux in the background regions can not be directly applied at the cluster location , we simply fix the  fcxb \" component to its average value and allow the scattered cluster emission component to be free , which may compensate for variations in the cxb flux in each region as well .",
