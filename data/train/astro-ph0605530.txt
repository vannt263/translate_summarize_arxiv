    "instead we made use of deep irac images of a very bright star in the extended chandra deep field south ( e - cdfs ) to generate a psf template that is bright enough out to a distance of @xmath47 away from the core .",
    "in fact , the template star is brighter than 3c  273 itself by a factor of @xmath48 in the @xmath46 band and by a factor of @xmath49 in the @xmath0 band , respectively . due to the saturation in both the 3c  273 and e - cdfs images , and possible contributions from the host galaxy of 3c  273",

    "note that in determining the photometric errors we have included the uncertainties imposed by background ( the wings of the core and the host galaxy ) subtraction .",
    "also , photometry is subject to systematic errors due to different spectral shapes , as the standard irac calibration is strictly valid for the specific case of @xmath82 . though we do not correct for this effect , the flux errors in this regard are less than 1% for the spectral slopes of interest .",

    "the jet emission downstream of knot b2 does not show well discernible peaks but emission features associated with knots c1 , d1 , and d2/h3 can be recognized in the x - ray image , which justifies to some extent our aperture photometry for the downstream knots .",
    "in addition to the photometry - based spectra , we have performed the more usual spectral analysis as a consistency check .",

    "interestingly , a study of multiwavelength spectra of small - scale blazar emission also gives large @xmath180 @xcite .",
    "in the theory of diffusive shock acceleration , for relativistic shocks , the factor @xmath180 corresponds roughly to the ratio of the energy density of regular magnetic fields to that of turbulent fields which resonantly scatter accelerating relativistic particles .",

    "there may be two distinct types of shocks characterized by different @xmath180 in the knots giving rise to their  double - synchrotron \" nature .",
    "alternatively , another acceleration mechanism may be operating , accounting in a natural way for a different acceleration rate for the second component .",
    "for instance , turbulent acceleration may occur in the shear of jet boundary layers @xcite , generating the second synchrotron component @xcite . in highly turbulent shear layers ,",
    "the acceleration rate can be estimated as @xmath186 , where @xmath187 denotes the alfvn velocity in units of @xmath188 .",

    "do not limit the acceleration process unless they reach ultra - high energies . instead , a condition set by @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the light - crossing timescale of the knot along the jet ( typically @xmath194 kyr ) , would give a conservative estimate of the maximum attainable energy of protons .",
    "here we use a light - crossing time rather than the  age \" of the jet , probably @xmath195 , to conservatively account for an escape loss which takes at least longer than a light - crossing time .",

    "remarkably , if @xmath199 ( close to the so - called bohm diffusion in the framework of diffusive shock acceleration ) , ultra - high - energy protons with energies @xmath200 can be accelerated in the jet of 3c  273 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "even with a large value of @xmath180 ( @xmath201 ) , the shear acceleration would still be capable of generating @xmath200 , since the turbulent acceleration in the shear layer may be available for much longer timscales .",
    "the fraction of jet power that goes to high energy protons depends on the particle content of the jet and the details of the physics of particle acceleration , both of which are not well known .",
    "it is interesting to note that if protons are indeed accelerated in the jet to very high energies , @xmath202 , the second synchrotron component can be produced directly by _ protons _ ,",
    "i.e. , proton synchrotron radiation @xcite , rather than by electrons . for the same particle energy , the characteristic frequency of proton synchrotron radiation , @xmath203 , is less than that of electron synchrotron radiation by a factor of @xmath204 .",
    "therefore , by using equation  ( [ eq : emax ] ) , the spectrum of proton synchrotron has a cutoff frequency of @xmath205 \\left ( \\frac{b}{\\rm mg}\\right )   \\left ( \\frac{e_{\\rm p , max}}{10^{18}\\ \\rm ev } \\right)^2\\   \\rm hz,\\ ] ] which is located above the x - ray domain .",

    ", @xcite obtained the acceleration power for protons of @xmath211 to explain the optical - x - ray spectrum of knot a in 3c  273 in terms of proton synchrotron radiation .",
    "previous explanations of the second , x - ray - dominated component of the sed for jet knots have emphasized the beamed ic scenario @xcite .",
    "specifically , relativistically beamed ic emission in the cmb photon field has been invoked to model the x - ray emission in 3c  273 @xcite , as well as in other quasar jets .",
    "this model requires a highly relativistic bulk velocity of the jet , with a doppler factor @xmath6 out to nearly megaparsec distances . a direct connection between the optical and x - ray fluxes in the inner knots a and b1 and also between the ultraviolet and x - ray fluxes in the outer knots ( see fig .  [ fig : sed ] ) led us to consider that the same mechanism should be responsible for the optical and x - ray emissions , forming a distinct high - energy component .",
    "if one adopts the beamed ic model for the x - rays , the optical fluxes in the inner knots and the ultraviolet fluxes in the outer knots should be explained also by the beamed ic radiation .",
    "this implies that the energy distribution of electrons has to continue down to very low energies of @xmath212 without a cutoff or break .    in this scenario ,",
    "one still should account for the optical polarization . in the case of  cold \" electrons in the jet ,",
    "compton up - scattering off the cmb by an ultrarelativistic jet ( so - called  bulk comptonization \" ) can yield in principle a high degree of polarization for the standard choice of @xmath213 @xcite .",

    "the present data of the radio and optical polarization @xcite may require a tuned set of physical conditions to reconcile with the beamed ic scenario .    in this respect",
    ", a possible caveat would be that in addition to the cmb , the synchrotron radiation of the jet itself might serve as seed photons for compton up - scattering ; if the highly relativistic jet accompanies slowly moving outer portions , the synchrotron radiation that comes from the slowing part can be relativistically enhanced in the fast moving jet , providing the effective photon fields for comptonization ( * ? ? ? * as discussed for small - scale jets ) .",
    "if the observed radio flux is largely contributed by a slow , non - relativistic layer , the energy density of the synchrotron photons ( as measured in the observer s frame ) could reach @xmath215 , being comparable to the cmb energy density . this possibility introduces a complication to the polarization argument .    within the framework of the beamed ic radiation ,",

    "compared to a typical value of @xmath216 in the previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a smaller minimum energy of the electron distributions , say @xmath212 , is required by the present data .",
    "note that this increases the estimate of the jet kinetic power by an order of magnitude if the jet power is dynamically dominated by cold protons .",
    "let us model the sed of knot a with a synchrotron plus beamed ic model of @xcite assuming @xmath217 and a knot radius of 1 kpc ( in the jet frame of reference ) .",
    "for a doppler factor of @xmath218 and magnetic field @xmath219 g as roughly corresponding to an equipartition condition , we obtain a jet kinetic power of @xmath220 , if the number of the observed electrons is balanced by the number of cold protons in the jet .",
    "however , such a large doppler factor of @xmath218 seems problematic , since relatively large contributions from the un - beamed components are observed in the core emission , such as an ultraviolet bump ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and the accretion - disk emission comparable to the jet emission in the x - ray regime @xcite .",
    "instead , if we adopt a smaller doppler factor of @xmath221 ( together with @xmath222 to account for the optical emission ) , the energy density of electrons exceeds that of magnetic fields more than three orders of magnitude , and the jet kinetic power reaches an uncomfortable level of @xmath223 . to summarize , the beamed ic model , in its simple form ,",
    "does not easily find a satisfactory set of parameters , particularly for the case of knot a.    finally , the upper limit to the infrared fluxes from the quiet portion of the jet upstream of knot a is important to constrain the structure of the jet in the context of the beamed ic model @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we need additional irac observations to derive a reliable upper limit there because of the large systematic uncertainty in psf subtraction in the region close to the quasar core .      in fig .",

    "the second component can be attributed to either synchrotron radiation by a second population of high - energy electrons ( or protons ) , or the beamed ic emission by the radio - emitting electrons . in the first case ,",

    "ultimately , the _ james webb space telescope _ , a future large infrared - optimized space telescope , will have an excellent capability to explore the jet emission in the irac band with much improved resolution and sensitivity .",
    "an interesting implication of this work is that a number of optical jets in radio - loud quasars discovered so far may be directly related to the x - ray emission rather than to the radio emission , as in the 3c  273 jet .",
    "for example , in @xcite , we have associated the optical flux of the jet knot in the quasar pks 0637@xmath4752 with the highest energy part of the synchrotron component .",

    "<S> we have performed infrared imaging of the jet of the quasar 3c  273 at wavelengths 3.6 and @xmath0 with the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the _ spitzer space telescope_. when combined with the radio , optical and x - ray measurements , the irac photometry of the x - ray - bright jet knots clearly shows that the optical emission is dominated by the high - energy emission component of the jet , not by the radio synchrotron component , as had been assumed to date . </S>",
    "<S> the high - energy component , represented by a power - law from the optical through x - ray , may be due to a second synchrotron component or to inverse compton scattering of ambient photons . in the former case , we argue that the acceleration of protons exceeding energies of @xmath1 or possibly even to @xmath2 would be taking place in the jet knots of 3c  273 assuming that the acceleration time is proportional to the particle gyroradius . in contrast , the inverse compton model , into which highly relativistic doppler beaming has to be incorporated , requires very low - energy electrons of @xmath3 in the jet knots . </S>",
    "<S> the present polarization data in the radio and optical would favor the former interpretation in the case of the 3c  273 jet . </S>",
    "<S> sensitive and detailed measurements of optical polarization are important to establish the radiation mechanism responsible for the high - energy emission . </S>",
    "<S> the present study offers new clues as to the controversial origin of the x - ray emission seen in many quasar jets . </S>"
