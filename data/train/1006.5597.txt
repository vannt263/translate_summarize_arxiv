    "flavor models based on discrete symmetries are often used to address issues like large / small mixing and mild / strong mass hierarchies in the lepton / quark sector ( for reviews , see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the permutation group @xmath0 is an attractive such candidate which was introduced in @xcite and explored further in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the exciting prospect that such flavor models can predict _ enlarged higgs sectors with non - standard couplings to fermions and gauge bosons _ , although such a nonsupersymmetric extension does not provide any additional stability to the potential .",
    "the main motivation here arises from flavor issues .",
    "its supersymmetrization would indeed bring in quantum stability , but in this work we stick to a minimal nonsupersymmetric @xmath0 flavor scenario .",
    "the motivation for choosing @xmath0 is that it is the smallest non - abelian discrete symmetry group that contains a irreducible representation which can connect two maximally mixed generations .",
    "it is the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle and has three irreducible representations : @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with multiplication rules : @xmath6 and @xmath7 . besides facilitating maximal mixing through its doublet representation ,",
    "@xmath0 provides two inequivalent singlet representations which play a crucial role in reproducing fermion masses and mixing . to accomplish the latter , three scalar @xmath1 doublets are introduced , which couple to the fermions as dictated by @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "it so happens that large mixing among up- and down - type quarks cancel each other in the cabibbo matrix .",
    "neutrino masses are separately generated by a type - ii see - saw mechanism using scalar @xmath1 triplets @xcite , so that the mismatch between the large mixing of the charged leptons and the diagonal neutrino masses translates directly into the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix . in this paper",
    "we do not deal with those triplets , but explore the following avenues : ( @xmath8 ) minimization of the scalar potential with three scalar @xmath1 doublets , two of which form an @xmath0 doublet and the third an @xmath0 singlet , ( @xmath9 ) the gauge and yukawa interactions of the neutral scalars , and ( @xmath10 ) different nonstandard production and decay modes of the neutral cp - even scalars leading to the possibility of their detection at the lhc .    for definiteness , we study the @xmath0 model pursued in @xcite to explain the leptonic flavor structure .",
    "we concentrate on the complementary aspects by exploring the scalar sector .",
    "the assignments of the fermion and scalar fields are as follows : @xmath11 where the notations are standard and self - explanatory .",
    "the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the three scalar doublets @xmath12 induce spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "the most general @xmath0 invariant scalar potential involving three scalar doublet fields is given by @xcite @xmath13 \\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] after ssb , nine degrees of freedom are left : three neutral scalars , two neutral pseudoscalars and two charged scalars with two degrees of freedom each .",
    "we denote the vevs of @xmath14 by @xmath15 and assume the @xmath16 s to be real . for the purpose of generating maximal mixing in the lepton sector , we choose the vacuum alignment @xmath17 .",
    "once we solve the tadpole equations , @xmath18 turns out to be an extremal condition if the following relations are satisfied : @xmath19 to ensure that the chosen vacuum alignment actually corresponds to a minimum of the potential , we adjust parameters to make sure that the determinant of the hessian matrix is positive .",
    "just to recall , the hessian is defined as the square matrix of second order partial derivatives of a function describing its local curvatures . in this case , the function is the scalar potential and the hessian is just the mass matrix of the scalars .",
    "the positivity of the eigenvalues  see later in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : scalarmasses ] )  guarantees that the potential is minimized .",
    "we note that after ssb , the potential turns out to be a polynomial of order four , and its global stability in the asymptotic limit ( i.e. @xmath20 ) is ensured by the following set of conditions : @xmath21    we now set out to find the spectrum of the three cp - even neutral scalars .",

    "one of the physical scalars is given by @xmath37 , i.e. there is no dependence on @xmath38 or on the vevs .",
    "this happens because @xmath0 symmetry requires the scalar mass matrix to be of the form @xmath39 which always yields @xmath40 as one eigenvector , regardless of the values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "we randomly vary the _ magnitude _ of the @xmath16 s in the range @xmath43 $ ] , although slightly larger ( but @xmath44 ) values of @xmath45 would have still kept the couplings perturbative .",
    "accept _ a given set of @xmath46 only if it satisfies the minimization conditions .",
    "the difference @xmath47 is positive , and when @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 , the splitting grows enormously .",
    "since the maximum value of @xmath50 is controlled by @xmath51 , @xmath52 becomes tachyonic when @xmath48 .",
    "it has been suggested in @xcite that with _ order one _ yukawa couplings , the ratio @xmath53 reproduces the correct cabibbo angle in the quark sector .",
    "we require @xmath54 to ensure that @xmath52 stays above the accepted limit . since @xmath55 and @xmath56 have similar gauge and yukawa properties , quite different from those of @xmath57 ( see discussions later ) , we show the mass splitting @xmath58 against @xmath59 in fig .  [ fig : scalar_massrelations](a ) , and the relation between @xmath59 and @xmath60 in fig .",

    "we observe the following : ( @xmath8 ) the coupling of @xmath55 to @xmath67 ( or , @xmath68 ) is the corresponding sm coupling multiplied by @xmath69 and the corresponding factor for @xmath56 is @xmath70 .",

    "the _ physical _ scalar couplings to the _ mass basis _",
    "fermions are given by the following yukawa matrices , displayed for the charged leptons as an example ( the structures for the quark sector are similar _ modulo _ cabibbo mixing ) : @xmath84 the position of the zeros in the matrices deserves some attention .",
    "it turns out that @xmath24 have off - diagonal fermion couplings at tree level due to the absence of any natural flavor conservation @xcite .",
    "the numerical entries of the yukawa matrices are intimately tied to the successful reproduction of the quarks and leptons masses and mixings .",

    "@xmath85   we admit that unless some @xmath0 breaking parameters are introduced a successful reproduction of @xmath86 and @xmath87 is problematic @xcite , and also domain walls will be formed .",

    "the last two points require further clarification . in a theory with more than one @xmath1 higgs doublet ,",
    "tree level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) generally exist in the scalar sector .",
    "for example , they exist in the ordinary ` two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) ' , but in the supersymmetric standard model they are avoided by the arrangement that one doublet couples only to the up - type fermions and the other to only the down - types . in nonsupersymmetric scenarios , in the absence of any natural flavor conservation , symmetry arguments have been advanced in the context of multi - higgs models to show that the off - diagonal yukawa couplings of the neutral scalars are suppressed by their relation to the off - diagonal entries of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite .    in the present case , @xmath0 symmetry , under which both scalars and fermions transform nontrivially ,",
    "is instrumental in suppressing the off - diagonal couplings . to provide intuitive understanding , we take , as an example , only the two - flavor @xmath90@xmath91 sector together with two neutral scalars @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the combination @xmath94 , which corresponds to @xmath57 , couples only off - diagonally , as mentioned earlier .",
    "but the other combination @xmath95 , which corresponds to @xmath82 following eq .",
    "( [ eqn : scalarmixing ] ) , couples only diagonally to physical @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",
    "when we consider the quark sector , @xmath90 and @xmath91 would be replaced by second and third generation quarks which will have ckm mixing .",
    "this will yield off - diagonal entries for @xmath82 couplings to quarks suppressed by the off - diagonal ckm elements .",
    "the same happens for off - diagonal couplings involving the first two generations as well .",
    "the tiny size of tree level fcnc rates in an @xmath0 flavor model has been noticed also earlier , where predictions for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 have been given @xcite . in some setups where the fermion transformations under @xmath0 are not appropriately adjusted",
    ", the off - diagonal yukawa couplings may become order one which induce sizable neutral scalar mediated rare processes , like @xmath99 or @xmath100 , at tree level .",
    "this requires those neutral scalars to lie beyond several tev @xcite .",
    "but in our case , once we adjust the @xmath101 s to reproduce the fermion masses and mixing , the off - diagonal yukawa couplings are determined too .",
    "the largest of them corresponds to @xmath102 , which is about 0.8 .",
    "the second largest off - diagonal coupling is that for @xmath103 , and is about 0.02 .",
    "the next in line is @xmath104 , whose coefficient is about 0.008 .",
    "the others are orders of magnitude smaller , and are of no numerical significance .",
    "although fcnc processes like @xmath105@xmath106 and @xmath107@xmath108 mixings proceed at tree level , the contributions are adequately suppressed even for light scalar mediators .",

    "recall that the existing limits on the higgs mass depend crucially on the gauge coupling of the higgs .",

    "the magnitude of @xmath121 depends on the choice of @xmath16 and @xmath29 .",

    "this is similar to what happens in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric models , when the lightest scalar would dominantly decay into two pseudoscalars , and each pseudoscalar would then decay into @xmath139 or @xmath140 final states . in view of these possible",
    "@xmath141 or @xmath142 higgs signals , lep data have been reanalyzed putting constraints on the higgs production cross section times the decay branching ratios @xcite .",
