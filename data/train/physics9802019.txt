    "the formation of density structures by the velocity field of highly compressible turbulence is of great interest in astrophysics .",
    "the determination of their typical amplitude , size and volume filling factor poses significant difficulties since it requires a knowledge of the full statistics . as a first step",
    ", we shall concentrate in this paper on one - point statistics and more specifically on the probability density function ( pdf ) of the density fluctuations in one - dimensional ( 1d ) turbulent flows .",
    "it is well known that the density jump in a shock depends directly on the cooling ability of the fluid .",
    "thus , for an adiabatic flow the maximum density jump is 4 , for an isothermal flow it is @xmath11 @xcite , and for nearly isobaric flows it is @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 is the mach number ahead of the shock .",
    "the net cooling ability of a flow can be conveniently parameterized by the polytropic exponent @xmath0 , so that the thermal pressure @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath4 is the fluid density @xcite .",
    "isothermal flows have @xmath16 , and isobaric flows have @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath18 corresponds to the isobaric mode of the thermal instability ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in general , the amplitude of the turbulent density fluctuations will be a function of @xmath0 .",
    "previous work with isothermal flows had suggested that the pdf is log - normal @xcite , while for burgers flows a power - law pdf has been reported @xcite .",
    "more recently , evidence that flows with effective polytropic indices @xmath19 also develop power - law tails at high densities has been presented @xcite . in order to resolve this discrepancy",
    ", we present a series of 1d numerical simulations of polytropic gas turbulence with random forcing , in which the polytropic exponent @xmath0 parameterizes the compressibility of the flow .",
    "we have chosen to use 1d simulations in order to perform a large number of experiments at a sufficiently high resolution , integrated over very long time intervals , allowing us to collect large statistical samples .",
    "the simulations have three governing parameters : the polytropic index @xmath0 , the mach number @xmath20 , and the reynolds number @xmath21 .",
    "we keep the reynolds number fixed , and explore the effects of varying @xmath0 and @xmath20 on the resulting density pdf .",
    "we find that varying these two parameters is not equivalent .",
    "variation of @xmath0 induces a clear qualitative variation of the density pdf , which , at large mach number , displays a power - law tail at high densities for @xmath19 , becomes log - normal at @xmath16 , and develops a power - law tail at low densities for @xmath7 .",
    "this suggests a symmetry about the case @xmath16 , which we also explore .",
    "variation of the mach number , on the other hand , only appears to induce a quantitative change , in such a way that increasing @xmath20 augments the width of the pdf .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] we describe the equations solved and the numerical method . in sec .",
    "[ statistics ] we describe the statistics of the various fields , in terms of their pdfs , together with a tentative model and a discussion of the burgers case . section [ conclusions ] is devoted to a discussion on the choice of the forcing , together with a summary of our results .",
    "we choose to concentrate on one - dimensional forced polytropic gas dynamics , governed by the following non - dimensionalized equations @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the velocity of the fluid in units of @xmath24 , @xmath4 the density in units of @xmath25 , @xmath0 the polytropic index and @xmath20 the mach number of the unit velocity @xmath24 at the unit density @xmath25 .",
    "the equations are driven by an acceleration @xmath26 with zero mean .",
    "the reynolds number is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the size of the domain and @xmath29 the kinematic viscosity chosen constant to ensure the conservation of the mean velocity @xmath30 .",
    "the viscous term is kept as small as possible and is only here to prevent numerical blow - up .",
    "note that the `` correct '' form of the viscous term is obtained after replacing @xmath29 by the ratio @xmath31 , where the dynamical viscosity @xmath32 is usually considered independent of the density .",
    "the equations then conserve the momentum @xmath33 if the acceleration @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : baseu ] ) is also replaced by the ratio of a force @xmath34 to the density @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics that results in this case is very different due to the dependence of the driving term with respect to the density , as discussed in the last section .    for large mach number simulations ,",
    "it was found necessary to smooth density gradients , using a mass diffusion term of the form @xmath35 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : baser ] ) .",
    "total mass is still conserved in the presence of this term , and if @xmath36 is taken sufficiently small , it has been tested that it does not affect the dynamics in a way that could modify our conclusions .",
    "we also found it convenient to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : baseu])-([eq : baser ] ) using the variable @xmath37 .",
    "the numerical code uses a standard pseudo - spectral method with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "time advance is performed using a crank - nicholson scheme for the linear terms and an adams - bashforth scheme for the nonlinear ones .",
    "for all the runs presented in this paper , the kinematic viscosity has been fixed to @xmath38 . for runs with @xmath39",
    ", we have @xmath40 .    the acceleration @xmath26 is prescribed in fourier space .",
    "its spectrum has a constant amplitude ( equal to 0.6 ) on wavenumbers @xmath41 and phases chosen randomly with a correlation time @xmath42 .",
    "resolution ranges from @xmath43 to @xmath44 grid points for the runs with @xmath45 .",
    "we perform one point statistics of the simulations , both for the density and the velocity derivative , keeping the forcing and the viscosity constant .",
    "all simulations start with zero initial velocity and constant density .    in order to obtain",
    "reasonably sampled histograms of the one - dimensional fields , which contain only @xmath46 spatial data points , we sum the histograms over time , sampling at intervals of @xmath47 time units , integrating over a total of 150 time units .",
    "however , we have found that , since the simulations start with uniform density , the first several samples must be discarded , since they bias the density histogram near @xmath48 .",
    "we typically skip the first 20 temporal samples ( 2 time units ) .",
    "the pdfs thus computed contain roughly 4 million data points .",
    "note that longer integration times are needed at larger mach number in order to reach a statistically relevant sample , the sound crossing time of the integration domain being larger as @xmath20 increases .",
    "before describing our model for the density pdf , it is instructive to rewrite the governing equations in the inviscid , unforced case , using the variable @xmath49 when @xmath50 and @xmath51 when @xmath52 .",

    "\\(i ) when @xmath16 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : su])-([eq : sr ] ) are invariant upon the change @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "indeed , the sound speed does not depend on the local density of the fluid .",
    "\\(ii ) in the general case , if we substitute @xmath0 by @xmath63 and @xmath4 by @xmath64 , we observe that the riemann invariants @xmath65 are exchanged , while their speeds @xmath66 remain unchanged",
    ". we shall now explore the implications of this remark on the statistics of the density fluctuations in the weakly compressible regime .",
    "for small values of the mach number , a reductive perturbation expansion can be performed on the viscous equations and it has been shown @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that one - dimensional compressible turbulence reduces essentially to the superposition of the solutions of two burgers equations describing nonlinear wave propagation in opposite directions . more precisely ( considering eqs .",

    "finally the functions @xmath80 ( simply related to the riemann invariants @xmath81 ) satisfy the burgers equations @xmath82 the fields @xmath80 evolve almost independently , with the same dynamical equation , except for phase shifts , a higher order effect most important during collisions of shock waves .",
    "given some initial conditions for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the substitution @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) , and @xmath85 leads to the replacement of @xmath86 and @xmath87 by @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "for a vanishingly small viscosity @xmath29 , the rescaling of the amplitudes @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be absorbed in a rescaling of the variables @xmath73 . except for this stretching of the space and time variables",
    ", this substitution will thus lead to the same fluctuations occurring at different locations . as a consequence",
    ", we can expect that the probability density functions of the cases @xmath0 and @xmath63 for small values of @xmath20 will be closely related after the change @xmath90 .",
    "the case of higher mach numbers is more delicate due to the additional problem of mass conservation , rendering impossible a symmetry between @xmath4 and @xmath64 .",
    "this question is addressed below .",
    "\\(iii ) the substitution @xmath91 can also be examined at the level of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigu])-([eq : sigr ] ) .",
    "its effect is simply to change the sign of the right - hand sides . for @xmath92 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigr ] ) shows that positive values of @xmath93 ( in this case associated with density peaks ) are mostly created by shocks ( associated with negative velocity gradients ) .",
    "looking at eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigu ] ) , we see that as @xmath56 increases , the pressure term becomes exponentially small and thus can not prevent the formation of very strong peaks .",
    "negative values of @xmath56 ( here associated with density voids ) are created by expansion waves , but in that case the pressure increases exponentially with decreasing values of @xmath56 leading to a rapid saturation of this process . as a consequence , we expect that for @xmath92 the pdf of @xmath56 will be significantly more populated at positive rather than at negative values",
    ". for @xmath0 larger than unity the pdf of @xmath56 will be similar , the formation of positive values of @xmath56 ( now associated with density voids ) being still unhindered by the pressure .",
    "it results that the pdf of @xmath94 for @xmath95 will appear similar to that for @xmath92 after we change @xmath96 .",
    "\\(iv ) when @xmath16 , the behavior is very different",
    "since the acceleration due to the pressure term is simply proportional to @xmath97 and thus never becomes negligible .",
    "we expect a symmetry in the pdf of @xmath8 , positive and negative values of @xmath8 being equally created , by shocks and expansion waves respectively .",
    "\\(v ) finally , it is also useful to discuss the shock jump relations for the polytropic equations . denoting by @xmath98 the ratio of the post - shock to the pre - shock density , we have ( see @xcite ) @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the upstream mach number in the reference frame of the shock .",
    "this equation shows that for @xmath16 , @xmath101 and that the jump @xmath98 increases more slowly than @xmath102 for @xmath7 , while it increases faster than @xmath102 for @xmath6 with , as @xmath103 , @xmath104 . for weak shocks , we get @xmath105 . in this case , the shock velocity being close to the sound speed , we can write @xmath106 , where @xmath23 is the velocity in the simulation frame , leading to @xmath107 .",
    "we thus get @xmath108 , with @xmath109 denoting the mach number in the simulation frame .",
    "note that typical pressure fluctuations created by almost incompressible turbulence scale like @xmath2 where the turbulent mach number is defined as @xmath110 ( here @xmath111 is mostly made of solenoidal motions unlike in our 1d simulations where it stands for purely compressible modes ) .",
    "this scaling corresponds to a balance between the pressure gradient and the nonlinear term . if entropy fluctuations are not allowed ( like with a polytropic state law ) , the resulting density fluctuations also have to scale as @xmath2 . in thermally forced turbulence however , a boussinesq - like balance obtains between temperature and density fluctuations , maintaining pressure fluctuations of order @xmath2 , while allowing for much larger values of density and temperature fluctuations @xcite .    in weakly nonlinear acoustics ,",
    "the pressure term is balanced by the velocity time derivative and we recover the scaling @xmath112 obtained for weak individual shocks .",
    "the main idea of our model is that density fluctuations are built up in a hierarchical process @xcite .",
    "after a shock ( respectively an expansion wave ) passes through a given region of mean density @xmath25 , the density reaches a new value @xmath113 , larger ( respectively smaller ) than @xmath25 . in this region",
    "new fluctuations can be created , changing the local value @xmath113 to @xmath114 and so on .",
    "of course the dynamical equations constrain this process .",
    "for example , due to mass conservation , arbitrarily high values of the density can only be reached in very localized and thin peaks .",
    "we thus expect this hierarchical process to saturate at some value @xmath115 .",
    "a similar saturation should occur for low densities at some value @xmath116 , with probably @xmath117 , due to the fact that larger voids can be created without violating the mass conservation constraint .",
    "the build up of these density fluctuations is a random multiplicative process which , at the level of the variable @xmath8 , becomes additive .",
    "the random variable @xmath8 is thus the sum of individual random variables ( the density fluctuations ) , each having the same probability distribution .",
    "the latter fact follows from the invariance of the equations at @xmath16 under the change @xmath118 , which furthermore implies that each individual jump has the same average magnitude , related to the mach number of the flow but independent of the local density .",
    "the sum of identical random processes is known to have a gaussian distribution , due to the central limit theorem , whatever the distribution of the individual processes .",
    "the pdf of @xmath8 is thus expected to follow a normal distribution .",
    "the variance of the random variable @xmath8 can be estimated using the size of the typical fluctuations associated both to shocks and expansion waves .",
    "the case of shock waves has been discussed above . at small values of @xmath20 , @xmath119 ( with the mach number @xmath120 ) so that @xmath121 . at high mach numbers ,",
    "the individual jumps obey @xmath122 . for expansion waves , the balance of the time derivative of @xmath8 and of the positive velocity gradient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sr ] ) , gives @xmath123 , regardless of the value of @xmath20 since the term @xmath124 is smaller than the term @xmath125 if the density decreases uniformly in space ( note that the decrease of @xmath4 is exponential in time ) .",
    "thus , with this mechanism , the density decreases in the center of the expansion waves while it increases on the edges , until pressure blocks the process . in the case",
    "@xmath16 pressure acts symmetrically in @xmath8 and we thus get positive and negative fluctuations which are of the same order of magnitude , and much larger than those due to shocks . we thus expect that @xmath126 for a large range of values of the mach number .    from the previous dicussion we can expect the pdf of the variable @xmath8 to be given by @xmath127 with @xmath128 , and @xmath129 a proportionality constant .",
    "the maximum of this distribution @xmath130 is simply related to @xmath131 due to the constraint of mass conservation . writing @xmath132 we find @xmath133 ( see below ) .",
    "note that the pdf of @xmath4 is related to that of @xmath8 by @xmath134 .",
    "the predictions of this model can be tested against results from numerical simulations .",
    "figure [ sig_vs_m_g1 ] ( top panel ) shows a plot of @xmath135 vs.   @xmath136 obtained by combining data from several simulations with @xmath137 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4.5 , 6 and 10 .",

    "fits with parabolas are shown in dashed lines and show that , to a very good approximation , the pdfs of the density are in all three cases log - normals .",

    "this distribution is found to be almost independent of the mach number .",
    "it presents a long exponential tail for negative values of @xmath147 and a strong drop off for large values , analogous to the one found in the burgers case @xcite .",
    "the difference between the case @xmath16 and the cases @xmath57 lies in the behavior of the pressure term as a function of the local density of the fluid , an effect which is most visible after comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigu ] ) with eq . ( [ eq : su ] ) . with the density - dependent rescaling @xmath149 ,",
    "the two equations identify , which only means that we expect the small - fluctuation behavior of the case @xmath57 to be identical to that of the case @xmath16 in regions where the local logarithm of the density is close to @xmath8 , when @xmath150 is substituted for @xmath20 .",
    "the argument at the origin of the pdf of @xmath8 in the isothermal case is based on the fact that the local mach number of the flow is independent of the local density . when @xmath57 this property is violated and there is no reason to expect a log - normal pdf for the density .",
    "we nevertheless propose a heuristic model , reproducing most of the features of the pdf s obtained in our simulations , which consists in taking the same functional form of the pdf as in the isothermal case , but replacing @xmath10 by @xmath151 , where @xmath151 now stands for the `` effective '' r.m.s .",

    "a clear trend is visible , indicating the change of the local mach number with the local mean density .",

    "they show that @xmath131 increases more slowly than linearly with @xmath10 for high mach numbers .",

    "this pdf has to be contrasted with the one obtained in @xcite , for which the reynolds number was low and the simulation decaying . in that case the power law at high densities was obtained but the pdf presents a sharp drop off for low densities .",
    "two - dimensional decaying simulations of the burgers equation are also presented in @xcite for moderate reynolds numbers .",
    "the plateau of the pdf at low values of the density is also obtained , while the power law for @xmath160 is not as clear . burgers simulations for the decaying infinite reynolds number case are presented in @xcite . in that case",
    "the pdf is calculated for the cumulated mass function and not for the density , which is not defined after the first shock formation .",
    "a power law is found , which extends to @xmath203 and connects to an exponential decay for @xmath204 .",
    "note that an exponential pdf for the density was predicted in @xcite on the basis of a model which treats shocks as completely inelastic particles .",
    "we can thus conclude this section by saying that the burgers case is truly a singular limit , which can not be reached as the high mach number limit of a polytropic gas , with @xmath205 .",
    "the study presented in this paper has been performed for a single choice of the forcing and of the reynolds number . while the variation with the latter parameter can be trivially extrapolated ,",
    "we can not a priori be sure that our results are independent of the type of forcing .",
    "we have performed decay runs and observed that the behavior of @xmath131 vs. @xmath10 is still the same as in the forced case .",
    "the pdfs however can not be computed on a single snapshot due to the poor statistics and can not be integrated in time since the mach number changes by roughly one or two orders of magnitude during the run .",
    "we have also performed a run at @xmath16 with a forcing of the form @xmath206 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : baseu ] ) . in that case",
    "the density pdf is not a lognormal anymore but presents a power law tail for low densities ( not shown ) .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the flow is stirred more vigorously at low densities so that the effective mach number indeed increases as @xmath4 decreases .",
    "we nevertheless think that our results can be extrapolated to an unforced situation , at a given time , and possibly also to the multi - dimensional case .",
    "note that the mach numbers we have explored in this paper would correspond to even higher mach numbers in the multi - dimensional case since in that case only a fraction of the total kinetic energy populates the compressible modes .",
    "we have presented an investigation of the density pdfs of a randomly accelerated polytropic gas for different values of the polytropic index and of the mach number . we have suggested a simple model in which the density field is everywhere constructed by a random succession of jumps @xcite . when the flow is isothermal ( @xmath16 ) , the jumps are independent of the initial density , and have always the same probability distribution .",
    "expressed with the variable @xmath207 the jumps are additive , and by the central limit theorem are expected to have a gaussian pdf , or a lognormal in @xmath4 .",
    "an analysis of the expected @xmath8 increments in the weak and strong shock cases , as well as those due to expansion waves , suggested that the variance @xmath1 should scale as the mean square turbulent mach number @xmath208 .",
    "moreover , because of mass conservation , the peak of the distribution @xmath130 is related to the variance by @xmath209 .",
    "these predictions were verified in 1d simulations of compressible turbulence .",
    "previous claims that it is the _ density _ variance @xmath210 that should scale as @xmath211 @xcite might have been misled by lower effective mach numbers than those achieved in the present simulations , in which all of the kinetic energy is in compressible modes thanks to the one - dimensionality .    when @xmath212 , the density jumps are not independent of the local density anymore , and the shape of the pdf should change . observing that a renormalization of the mach parameter ( eq .  ( [ eq : baseu ] ) )",
    "@xmath213 restores the form of the equations for the case @xmath16 , we proposed the ansatz that the pdf may still be described by the same functional form as in the case @xmath16 , but substituting @xmath20 by @xmath214 .",
    "this prediction is confirmed by the numerical simulations , giving pdfs which are qualitatively in very good agreement with the model pdf , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdfgne1 ] ) .",
    "the result is that the pdf asymptotically approaches a power law on the side where @xmath215 , while it decays faster than lognormally on the other side .    upon the replacements @xmath216 and @xmath217 we find , using the condition of mass conservation , that the slope @xmath218 of the power law for a given value of @xmath0 is related to its value at @xmath63 by eq .",
    "( [ eq : symalpha ] ) in the large mach number limit .",
    "these results are also confirmed by the numerical simulations , which exhibit a power law at @xmath160 when @xmath6 and at @xmath159 when @xmath7 , with slopes which are roughly related by eq .",
    "( [ eq : symalpha ] ) , with better accuracy at large mach numbers .",
    "finally , on the basis of these results , we suggested that the burgers case should develop a power law pdf at both large and small densities , since in this case there is no pressure on either side .",
    "this result was again confirmed by a simulation of a burgers flow .",
    "we shall conclude this paper by pointing out that the non - uniqueness of the infinite mach number limit might have important consequences for astrophysical applications , such as in cosmology .",
    "the so - called zeldovich @xcite approximation is indeed based on the burgers equation which , at the light of the present work , appears as a questionable model of highly compressible flows .",
    "this point will be addressed in future work .",
