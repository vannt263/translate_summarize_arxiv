    "in the standard electroweak model of glashow , weinberg and salam , the absence of the right - handed neutrinos and the existence of an exact accidental global @xmath1 symmetry guarantees that the neutrinos are massless to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "any experimental evidence for a non - zero neutrino mass therefore constitutes evidence for new physics beyond the standard model and will be a major step towards a deeper understanding of new forces in nature@xcite . among the many experiments that are under way at this moment searching directly or indirectly ( e.g. via neutrino oscillations ) for neutrino masses ,",
    "one of the most important ones is the search for neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "this process is allowed only if the neutrino happens to be its own antiparticle ( majorana neutrino ) as is implied by many extensions of the standard model .",
    "in fact there is a well - known theorem@xcite that states that any evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay is an evidence for nonzero majorana mass for the neutrinos .",
    "it is of course a much more versatile probe of new physics as we will discuss in this article .",
    "the point is that since @xmath0 decay changes lepton number ( @xmath2 ) by two units any theory that contains interactions that violate electron lepton number @xmath2 can in principle lead this process .",
    "this therefore reflects the tremendous versatility of @xmath0 decay as a probe of all kinds of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "indeed we will see that already very stringent constraints on new physics scenarios such as the left - right symmetric models with the see - saw mechanism@xcite and supersymmetric models with r - parity violation@xcite , scales of possible compositeness of leptons etc are implied by the existing experimental limits@xcite on this process . for",
    "a more detailed discussion of the theoretical situation than is possible here , see @xcite . for an update of the experimental situation , both ongoing and in planning stage ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this talk is organized as follows : in section 2 , i discuss the basic mechanisms for neutrinoless double beta decay ; in section 3 , the implications of the present limits on the lifetime for neutrinoless double beta decay for neutrino mixings are discussed ; in part section 4 , i go on to discuss the kind of new physics scenarios that can be probed by @xmath0 decay and the constraints on the parameters of the new physics scenarios implied by present data .",
    "as is wellknown , if the neutrino is its own antiparticle , the conventional four - fermi interaction can lead to neutrinoless double beta decay via the diagram in fig .",
    "1 . in physics scenarios beyond the standard models , if there are heavy majorana fermions interacting with the electrons , diagrams similar to fig .",
    "1 with neutrino line replaced by the majorana fermions can also lead to @xmath0 decay .",
    "examples of such particles abound in literature : right - handed neutrino , photino , gluino to mention a few popular ones .",
    "= 7.5 cm = 7.5 cm    one could therefore give an arbitrary classification of the mechanisms for @xmath0 decay into two kinds : ( a ) one class that involves the exchange of light neutrinos ; and ( b ) the second class that involves heavy fermions or bosons .",
    "furthermore , there are two distinct mechanisms for light neutrino exchange contributions : ( a ) helicity flip light neutrino mass mechanism and ( b ) helicity nonflip vector - vector or vector - scalar mechanism . in case ( a ) , one can write the amplitude @xmath3 for neutrinoless double beta decay to be : @xmath4 whereas in case ( b ) , it looks like : @xmath5 to extract neutrino mass implications for neutrinoless double beta decay , we need to note the explicit form of @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the mixing matrix elements for the electron neutrino with the other neutrinos",
    ". therefore a constraint on the @xmath6 can be converted into constraints on the neutrino mixings involving the first generation .",
    "incidentally , one can also write @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 entry of the neutrino mass matrix in the weak basis .",
    "thus any theory which has zero entry in the @xmath11 location leads to vanishing neutrinoless double beta decay even if the neutrino is a majorana particle .",
    "it is important to remark that these kind of light neutrino exchange diagrams always lead to a long range neutrino potential inside the nucleons and therefore , crudely speaking the two nucleons `` far '' from each other can contribute in the double beta decay .",
    "this has important implications for the evaluation of the nuclear matrix element@xcite , an important subject we do not discuss here .",
    "we will instead use an effective momentum to parameterize the effect of the nuclear matrix element calculations ( we will roughly choose @xmath12 mev ) .",
    "the width for double beta decay amplitude is given by @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the available energy for the two electrons . using the present most stringent limit on @xmath15 years obtained for @xmath16 by the heidelberg - moscow group ,",
    "one can obtain the upper limit on the width to be @xmath17 gev ; using eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath18 for the light neutrino contribution , @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 mev , one gets a rough upper limit of .7 ev for the neutrino mass .",
    "a more careful estimate leads to @xmath21    ( b ) : the second class of mechanisms consists of exchange of heavy particles which often arise in physics scenarios beyond the standard model . in the low energy limit , the effective hamiltonian that leads to @xmath0 decay in these cases requires point interaction between nucleons ; as a result , in general the nuclear matrix elements are expected to be smaller due to hard core repulsive nuclear potential ; nevertheless , a lot of extremely useful information have been extracted about new physics where these mechanisms operate .",
    "symbolically , such contributions can arise from effective hamiltonians of the following type ( we have suppressed all gamma matrices as well as color indices ) : @xmath22 or @xmath23    here @xmath24 represents a neutral majorana fermion such as the right - handed neutrino ( @xmath25)@xcite or gluino @xmath26 or photino @xmath27 and @xmath28 represents a doubly charged scalar or vector particle . in the above equations , the coupling @xmath29 has dimension of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is dimensionless .",
    "the possibility of the doubly charged scalar contribution to @xmath0 was first noted in @xcite and have been discussed subsequently in @xcite .",
    "the contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay due to the above interactions lead to @xmath0 amplitudes of the form : @xmath32 and @xmath33    here again we have crudely replaced all nuclear effects by the effctive momentum parameter @xmath34 . if we choose @xmath35 mev , then the present lower limit on the lifetime for @xmath16 decay leads to a crude upper limit on the effective couplings as follows : @xmath36 and @xmath37    in the second equation above , we have set @xmath38 .",
    "note that these limits are rather stringent and therefore have the potential to provide useful constraints on the new physics scenarios that lead to such particles .",
    "this conference watched the history of neutrino physics take a remarkable new turn .",
    "convincing evidence was presented by the super - kamiokande collaboration for the existence of neutrino oscillation of the atmospheric muon neutrinos to either @xmath39 or a sterile neutrino .",
    "using data both in the sub - gev and multi - gev energy range for the electron and the muon neutrinos as well as the zenith angle dependence of the muon data , the present fits at 90% confidence level seem to imply the following values for the oscillation parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 : @xmath42 ev@xmath43 with @xmath41 between .8 to 1@xcite . the possibility of @xmath44 oscillation as an explanation of the atmospheric anomaly seems to run into conflict with the recent chooz @xcite experiments .",
    "neutrino oscillation also seems to be the only way to understand the deficit of the solar neutrinos@xcite .",
    "the detailed oscillation mechanism in this case is however is unclear .",
    "the three possibilities are : a ) small - angle msw@xcite , @xmath45 ; b ) large - angle msw , @xmath46 ; c ) vacuum oscillation , @xmath47 .",
    "the data on neutrino energy distribution presented at this conference indicates a preference towards vacuum oscillation rather than msw mechanism . turning to the laboratory experiments ,",
    "the lsnd@xcite collaboration has presented evidence in favor of a possible oscillation of @xmath48 as well as @xmath49 .",
    "the preferred @xmath40 range seems to be @xmath50 ev@xmath43 with a mixing angle in the fea percent range .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath0 gives only an upper bound of @xmath51ev .",
    "another effect of neutrino mass is in the arena of cosmology , where it not only effects whether the universe keeps expanding for ever or it eventually collapses onto itself , but it also determines the detailed manner in which structure formed in the early universe .",
    "this subject is in a constant state of flux due to new cosmological data coming in at a very rapid rate .",
    "but the idea that the present structure data may need a neutrino mass contribution to the dark matter is very much alive ( see for instance ref.@xcite which seems to suggest that a total neutrino mass of 4 - 5 ev which contributes about 20% of the dark matter along with 70% cold dark matter and 10% baryon gives the best fit to the galaxy power spectrum data .",
    "this taken seriously would mean that @xmath52 ev ) .    with the above input information ,",
    "if we stay within the minimal three neutrino picture , then the solar neutrino puzzle can be resolved by @xmath53 oscillations and the atmospheric neutrino deficit by @xmath54 oscillations and the lsnd results can not be accomodated .",
    "note that these observables are controlled only by the mass square difference ; on the other hand , the required hot dark matter implies that at least one or more of the neutrinos must have mass in the few ev range .",
    "it was pointed out@xcite in 1993 that , in the minimal picture , this leads to a scenario , where all three neutrinos are nearly degenerate , with @xmath55 ev .",
    "it is then clear that , in this case , in general there will be an observable amplitude for neutrinoless double beta decay mediated by the neutrino mass . in fact , if the limit on @xmath56 is taken to be less than @xmath57 ev as is implied for a certain choice of the nuclear matrix element , then the mixing must satisfy the constraint : @xmath58 since each of the elements in the above sum is complex , the @xmath59 form the three sides of a triangle@xcite . then using the unitarity relation for the @xmath60 matrix ,",
    "it is clear that one must have @xmath61 . on the other hand ,",
    "the chooz data for a general three neutrino oscillation picture implies that @xmath62 .",
    "these two constraints then imply that @xmath63 .",
    "this is indeed an interesting constraint and rules out ( provided of course @xmath64 ev@xmath43 ) a maximal mixing scenario for degenerate neutrinos that was proposed to reconcile sub - ev double beta decay neutrino mass limit i.e.@xcite @xmath65    there is however another mixing pattern for the degenerate neutrino scenario which is consistent with both the chooz experiment and the neutrinoless double beta decay bounds : @xmath66 other more general constraints for this case have been studied in several recent papers@xcite .",
    "if we do not include the hot dark matter constraint , then there is no need to require that the neutrinos are degenerate in mass and one can live perfectly happily with a hierarchical pattern of neutrino masses as dictated by the simple type i seesaw formula . in that case",
    ", one can combine the atmospheric oscillation fits and the chooz data to set an upper limit on @xmath6 equal to @xmath67 ev@xcite .",
    "thus evidence for @xmath6 above this value would be an indication that either the neutrino mass pattern is not hierarchical or that the atmospheric neutrino puzzle involves transition between @xmath68 and a sterile neutrino .",
    "both of these are extremely valuable conclusions .",
    "the genius proposal of the heidelberg group@xcite is expected to push the double beta decay limit to this level and could therefore test this conclusion .",
    "let us now discuss the constraints implied by neutrinoless double beta decay searches on the new physics scenarios beyond the standard model .",
    "let us first consider the the neutrino mass mechanism . any theory which gives the electron neutrino a significant ( @xmath69 ev ) majorana mass or any other species ( e.g. @xmath68 or @xmath39 ) a large enough mass and mixing angle with the @xmath70 so that @xmath71 is of order of an electron volt will make itself open to testability by the @xmath0 decay experiment .",
    "there are many theories with such expectations for neutrinos .",
    "below i described two examples : ( i ) the singlet majoron model and ( ii ) the left - right symmetric model .",
    "both these models are intimately connected with ways to understand the small neutrino mass in gauge theories .",
    "this model@xcite is the simplest extension of the standard model that provides a naturally small mass for the neutrinos by employing the the see - saw mechanism@xcite .",
    "it extends the standard model by the addition of three right - handed neutrinos and the addition of a single complex higgs field @xmath72 which is an @xmath73 singlet but with a lepton number + 2 .",
    "there is now a dirac mass for the neutrinos and a majorana mass for the right handed neutrinos proportional to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath74 .",
    "this leads to a mass matrix for the neutrinos with the usual see - saw form : @xmath75        where we have ignored all mixings and @xmath77 denote the masses of the heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "it is clear that the electron neutrino mass can be in the electron - volt range if the values of @xmath78 are chosen to be of similar order of magnitude to the electron mass .",
    "in fact , for @xmath79 , and @xmath80 gev , one gets @xmath81 ev which is the range of masses being probed by the ongoing and proposed @xmath0 experiments .",
    "more importantly , this class of models leads to the new neutrinoless double beta decay process with majoron emission@xcite which has a very different electron energy distribution than either @xmath82 or @xmath83 double beta decays .",
    "the relevant feynman diagram is same that in fig .",
    "1 with a majoron line emanating from the light neutrino in the middle .",
    "the majoron coupling @xmath84 then replaces the neutrino mass in the @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "this observation has led to a considerable amount of experimental effort into searching for the majoron emitting double beta decay and limits at the level of @xmath85 are presently available .",
    "a relevant question is whether majoron couplings at the level measurable are expected in reasonable extensions of the standard model .",
    "there have been extensive studies of this question and is beyond the scope of this review .",
    "but it is of interest to note that in the simplest singlet majoron model , one expects @xmath86 . in the absence of any mixings ,",
    "this is proportional to @xmath87 which is expected to be of order @xmath88 for an ev @xmath70 and 100 gev for the @xmath1 breaking scale . however , if the @xmath39 mass is in the mev range as is allowed by lep analysis , this coupling could easilly be in the @xmath89 to @xmath90 range which is clearly in the range accessible to experiments .",
    "let us now consider the minimal left - right symmetric model with a see - saw mechanism for neutrino masses as described in @xcite .",
    "below , we provide a brief description of the structure of the model .",
    "the three generations of quark and lepton fields are denoted by @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively , where @xmath93 is the generation index . under the gauge group @xmath94 , they are assumed to transform as @xmath95 and @xmath96 and similarly for the quarks denoted by @xmath97 . in this model , there is a right - handed counterpart to the @xmath98 to be denoted by @xmath99 .",
    "their gauge interactions then lead to the following expanded structure for the charged weak currents in the model for one generation prior to symmetry breaking ( for our discussion , the quark mixings and the higher generations are not very important ; so we will ignore them in what follows . )",
    "@xmath100\\ ] ] where @xmath101      the yukawa couplings for the lepton sector which are invariant under gauge and parity symmetry can be written as : @xmath104 where @xmath105 are hermitian matrices while @xmath106 is a symmetric matrix in the generation space . @xmath107 and @xmath14 here denote the leptonic and quark doublets respectively .",
    "the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values : @xmath108 @xmath109 and @xmath110 as usual , @xmath111 gives masses to the charged fermions and dirac masses to the neutrinos whereas @xmath112 leads to the see - saw mechanism for the neutrinos in the standard way@xcite .",
    "for one generation the see - saw matrix is in the form @xmath113 and leads as before to a light and a heavy state as discussed in the previous section . for our discussion here it is important to know the structure of the light and the heavy neutrino eigenstates : @xmath114 where @xmath115 and is therefore a small number . substituting these eigenstates into the charged current lagrangian , we see that the right - handed @xmath116 interaction involves also the light neutrino with a small strength proportional to @xmath117 . to second order in the gauge coupling @xmath118 , the effective weak interaction hamiltonian involving both the light and",
    "the heavy neutrino becomes : @xmath119\\nu + \\xi\\overline{e}(1-\\gamma_5)n ] \\nonumber \\\\ + { { g_f}\\over{\\sqrt{2}}}\\left({{m^2_{w_l}}\\over{m^2_{w_r}}}\\right ) \\left(\\overline{u}\\gamma^{\\mu}(1+\\gamma_5)d\\overline{e}\\gamma_{\\mu } ( 1+\\gamma_5)n\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ + ~h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from eq .",
    "( 20 ) , we see that there are several contributions to the @xmath0 . aside from the usual neutrino mass diagram ( fig.1 )",
    ", there is a contribution due to the wrong helicity admixture with @xmath120 and there are contributions arising from the exchange of heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "this last contribution is given by : @xmath121    the present limits on neutrinoless double beta decay lifetime then imposes a correlated constraint on the parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123@xcite .",
    "if we combine the theoretical constraints of vacuum stability then , the present @xmath16 data provides a lower limit on the masses of the right handed neutrino ( @xmath124 ) and the @xmath125 of 1 tev , which is a rather stringent constraint .",
    "we have of course assumed that the leptonic mixing angles are small so that there is no cancellation between the parameters .    finally , the higgs sector of the theory generates two types of contributions to @xmath0 decay .",
    "one arises from the coupling of the doubly charged higgs boson to electrons ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the amplitude for the decay is same as in eq .",
    "( 6 ) except we have @xmath126 and @xmath127    using this expression , we find that the present @xmath16 data implies that ( assuming @xmath128 tev ) @xmath129 a second type higgs induced contribution arises from the mixing among the charged higgs fields in @xmath130 and @xmath131 which arise from the couplings in the higgs potential , such as tr@xmath132 after the full gauge symmetry is broken down to @xmath133 .",
    "let us denote this mixing term by an angle @xmath134 .",
    "this will contribute to the four - fermi interaction of the form given by the @xmath135 term with @xmath136 where we have assumed that @xmath137 is the lighter of the two higgs fields .",
    "we get @xmath138 , which is quite a stringent constraint on the parameters of the theory . to appreciate this somewhat more ,",
    "we point out that one expects @xmath139 in which case , we get an upper limit for the coupling of the higgs triplets to leptons @xmath140 ( for @xmath141 ) . taking a reasonable choice of @xmath142",
    "would correspond to a limit @xmath143 .",
    "limits on this parameters from analysis@xcite of bhabha scattering is only of order @xmath144 or so for the same value of the higgs mass .",
    "an interesting recent development is that once one supersymmetrizes the seesaw version of the left - right model just described , allowed values for the right handed scale get severely restricted by the requirement that the ground state of the tehory conserve electric charge .",
    "there are only two allowed domains for @xmath145 : ( i ) if the ground state breaks r - parity , there is an upper limit on the @xmath125 scale of about @xmath146 tev@xcite .",
    "since in this case , r - parity is spontaneously broken r - parity violating interactions conserve baryon number and the theory therefore is much improved in the sense of naturalness over the mssm .",
    "what is interesting is that the genius experiment can then completely scan the allowed range of this model . on the other hand ,",
    "if r - parity is conserved , there must be a lower limit on @xmath145 of about @xmath147 gev@xcite . in this case",
    "also there is a contribution to @xmath0 decay coming from the light doubly charged higgs boson in the same manner described above@xcite .",
    "this contribution scales like @xmath148 in the amplitude .",
    "thus as the limits on neutrinoless double beta decay improve , at some point they will not only imply that the @xmath125 mass is not only bigger than @xmath147 gev or so ; but they can also continue to improve this lower limit due to the contribution from the doubly charged higgs boson whose mass is directly proportional to the square of @xmath149 .      the next class of theories we will consider is the supersymmetric stamdard model . as is well - known",
    ", the minimal supersymmetric standard model can have explicit@xcite violation of the r - symmetry ( defined by @xmath150 ) , leading to lepton number violating interactions in the low energy lagrangian .",
    "the three possible types of couplings in the superpotential are :      here @xmath152 stand for the lepton and quark doublet superfields , @xmath153 for the lepton singlet superfield and @xmath154 for the quark singlet superfields .",
    "@xmath155 are the generation indices and we have @xmath156 , @xmath157 .",
    "the @xmath158 and color indices in eq .",
    "( 24 ) are contracted as follows : @xmath159 , etc .",
    "the simultaneous presence of all three terms in eq .",
    "( 25 ) will imply rapid proton decay , which can be avoided by setting the @xmath160 . in this case",
    ", baryon number remains an unbroken symmetry while lepton number is violated .",
    "there are two types of to @xmath0 decay in this model .",
    "one class dominantly mediated by heavy gluino exchange@xcite falls into the class of type ii contributions discussed in the previous section .",
    "the dominant diagram of this class is ahown in fig .",
    "detailed evaluation of the nuclear matrix element for this class of models has recently been carried out by hirsch et .",
    "al.@xcite and they have found that a very stringent bound on the following r - violating parameter can be given : @xmath161 it has been recently pointed out by faessler et al@xcite that if one assumes the dominance of pion exchange in these processes , the limits @xmath162 becomes more stringent by a factor of 2 .",
    "the second class of contributions fall into the light neutrino exchange vector - scalar type@xcite and the dominant diagram of this type is shown in fig.4.(where the exchanged scalar particles are the @xmath163 pair ) .",
    "this leads to a contribution to @xmath164 given by @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "here @xmath167 are supersymmetry breaking parameters , while @xmath168 is the supersymmetric mass of the higgs bosons .",
    "tan@xmath169 is the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values and lies in the range @xmath170 . for the choice of all squark masses",
    "as well as @xmath168 and the susy breaking mass parameters being of order of 100 gev , @xmath171 , tan@xmath172,the following bound on r - violating couplings is obtained : @xmath173 this bound is a more stringent limit on this parameter than the existing ones .",
    "the present limits on these parameters are @xmath174 , which shows that the bound derived here from @xmath0 is about five orders of magnitude more stringent on the product @xmath175 . if the exchanged scalar particles in fig.9 are the @xmath176 pair , one obtains a limit @xmath177      if the quarks and leptons are composite particles , it is natural to expect excited leptons which will interact with the electron via some effective interaction involving the @xmath179 boson . if the excited neutrino is a majorana particle , then there will be contributions to @xmath0 decay mediated by the excited neutrinos ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "the effctive interaction responsible for this is obtained from the primordial interaction : @xmath181    here l and r denote the left and right chirality states .",
    "this contribution falls into our type b heavy particle exchange category and has been studied in detail in two recent papers@xcite and have led to the conclusion that it leads to a lower bound @xmath182 for @xmath183 .",
    "this is a rather stringent bound on the compositeness scale .    in conclusion ,",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay provides a very versatile way to probe scenarios of physics beyond the standard model . in this review",
    ", we have focussed only on the @xmath82 mode and briefly touched on the single majoron mode .",
    "single and multi majoron modes which test for the possibility of lepton number being a spontaneously broken global symmetry have been extensively discussed in literature@xcite .",
    "the @xmath82 mode acquires special interest in view of the recent discoveries in neutrino physics as well as certain so(10 ) models predicting such spectra without contradicting the solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",
