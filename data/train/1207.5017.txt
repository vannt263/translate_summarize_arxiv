    "as one derives the _ effective locality _ property of the fermionic qcd amplitudes  @xcite , a bizarre factor of @xmath0 comes about , in an unexpected place , where @xmath1 is the impact parameter of two scattering quarks .",
    "inspection shows that this curious factor is not related to any systematic approximation scheme , such as eikonal or quenching .",
    "rather , it shows up as an unavoidable feature of any treatment , exact or approximate , and is likely to suggest the neglect of transverse fluctuations of quarks confined inside hadrons . in this respect , quite interesting perspectives offer themselves  @xcite .    both quenched and eikonal approximations will be used throughout .",
    "both seem quite in line with the context of a highly energetic scattering process : the former because one may think that the vacuum back - reaction has not enough time to influence the process , and the latter because it is constructed in a lorentz covariant way from the old bloch - nordsieck approximation  @xcite , and is appropriate for high - energy scattering at momentum transfers substantially less than the scattering energies . for such processes ,",
    "the fourier momenta @xmath2 of the interacting @xmath3- fields are typically of the same order - of - magnitude as the momentum transfer , and the conventional eikonal approximation is built around the idea that @xmath4 ( for `` hard scattering '' , there are eikonal variants of this `` soft '' scattering setting  @xcite ) .    in this article ,",
    "our aim is twofold . in the first place ,",
    "it is made clear that this @xmath0 can not be avoided , and a rigorous mathematical proof is proposed to support this claim .",
    "this is the matter of section  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec:3 ] , as a second step , in eikonal and quenched approximations , it is shown how the powerful _ random matrix _ calculus can be used to obtain the generic , closed form expression of qcd fermionic amplitudes in the strong coupling regime .",
    "eventually , in section  [ sec:4 ] , the forms so obtained will be used to revisit and improve upon a previous estimate of the quark / anti - quark binding potential and related aspects  @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the results is presented in section  [ sec:5 ] , and a short appendix concludes this article .",

    "the fradkin field variables satisfy @xmath33    and a few words of explanation may be in order . from fradkin s original representation , originally in terms of @xmath34 and here denoted by @xmath35 , this quantity has the interpretation of a particle s @xmath36-velocity or , depending on the mass - scale used , of a @xmath36-momentum . but while undergoing fluctuations at every @xmath37-value , that particle needs not be on its mass shell .",

    "eventually , it must be stressed that none of the features of effective locality is dependent upon this eikonal approximation ; rather , the latter is used to provide a simple enough way to derive an effective quark - binding potential out of the relevant eikonal amplitude , taken as a function of the quark s _ impact parameter _ , _",

    "( [ eq : s2 - 5 ] ) reads accordingly  @xcite @xmath51    where the @xmath52 and @xmath53-variables are used so as to extract the @xmath54-field dependence out of the ordered exponential of eq .",

    "given the very place where it comes about , as a multiplicative factor in an exponential , this @xmath72 is awkward . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been suggested that this factor is a remnant of the implicit existence of asymptotic quark states , an assumption which , beyond the stage of perturbation theory , can not be maintained in qcd , neither theoretically nor experimentally  @xcite .    this point of view leads to a change of @xmath72 into a modified , smeared and normalized impact parameter distribution of form  @xcite @xmath73    where @xmath74 is a typical mass term used to calibrate the transverse momenta distribution of quarks inside a given bound state . in the transverse plane ,",

    "that is , starting from quark propagation as ordinarily conceived , _  la _ @xmath81 , in the non - perturbative bound context , one could be lead to think of ( transverse ) quark propagation in terms of _ lvy - flights _ that are _ markovian _ diffusive processes ; a picture which , in view of color confinement , may look pretty sensible indeed .    whatever its interpretation , though , the latter will be ruined if eq .",

    "though , the quark confining potential associated to the scattering eikonal amplitude is then found to be identically zero  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , an elementary _ deformation _ of the random transverse quark gaussian distribution has been proposed in order to prevent such an odd result from occurring  @xcite .",
    "fortunately enough , at @xmath112 , that deformation ( which , more precisely , does nt bear on the lvy flight distribution itself , but on its _ characteristic function _ ) , falls into a stable and canonical generalization of random variable gaussian distributions that are compatible with a generalized _ central limit theorem _ of statistical physics  @xcite .    in a second place , we have made use of the most efficient _ random matrix _",
    "calculus so as to obtain the generic structure of fermionic qcd amplitudes , at least at quenched and eikonal approximations .",
    "illustrated on the simpler case of a @xmath36-point green s function , the results can be easily extended to any @xmath44-point function , and could therefore open the route to phenomenological applications .",
    "an amazing and non - trivial aspect of the resulting amplitude is that within one and the same expression , it is able to encode some hadronic non - perturbative aspect together with the perturbative partonic content of the hadronic matter .",
    "it is worth noting that such a link has been advocated recently ( and the way by which this link must come about ) within the ads / qcd approach to non - perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the amplitude s generic forms so obtained comply with a conjecture concerning the form quantum field theory s generating functionals must display in full generality  @xcite . in effect , while the latter must be expressed in terms of _ fox special functions _ , our amplitudes turn out to be written in terms of _ meijer s special functions _ that are but a particular instance of the former .",
    "however , the conclusions are here obtained on the bases of eikonal and quenched approximations to the full strong coupling fermionic scattering amplitudes .",
    "for example , this means that so long as quenched ( at least ) is not relaxed , the relevance of that @xmath79-parameter ( describing a lvy - flight _ markovian _ diffusion mode of propagation for confined quarks ) remains somewhat uncertain ; and this , in spite of its fascinating relation to confinement , to a possible transverse non - commutative geometrical aspect of non - perturbative qcd , to confined quarks lvy - flight modes of propagation , to ( spontaneous ) chiral symmetry breaking and another related aspect of non - perturbative qcd not evoked in this article .    since , on the other hand , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are not restricted to any sort of approximation , one may hope that , at least at a qualitative level , our present conclusions could be somewhat preserved while relaxing the quenched approximation .",
    "still , that remains to be checked .",
    "it is true also that the traceless character of the random matrices @xmath162 has not been implemented in our analysis : so far as could be seen , this point does nt seem to modify in a drastic way the general features put forth in this article ; still , it needs to be evaluated in a cogent way .",
    "clearly , more work is necessary to explore on firm grounds the consequences of such an intriguing , non - perturbative property as effective locality .    in these perspectives",
    ", quark propagator s full calculation and self energy effects should bring some new understanding , and shall be the matter of forthcoming analyses .",
