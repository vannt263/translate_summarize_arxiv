    "both videos ( file://anc / anim_dfd_hq.avi[high quality video ] and file://anc / anim_dfd_lq.avi[low quality video ] ) show the vorticity evolution at a counter rotating open rotor configuration acquired with stereoscopic particle image velocimetry in phase locked sense .",
    "the color coded vectors represent the convection velocity and only every fourth vector and second vector are shown in horizontal and vertical direction , respectively . for each measurement 500",
    "instantaneous piv acquisitions have been obtained .",
    "each frame is subsequently ordered in bins of 3 deg ."
