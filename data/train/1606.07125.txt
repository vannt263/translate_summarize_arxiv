    "for example , well - known properties of the classical orthogonal polynomials can be obtained from by manipulating their generating functions to produce recurrence relations satisfied by these polynomials .",

    "* , theorem 55 ) ) , along with the fact that the zeros must lie in the interval on which the family of polynomials is orthogonal . + the goal of the present paper is to describe the extent to which similar conclusions can be drawn for polynomials generated by functions of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 $ ] is a polynomial of degree @xmath14 with only positive ( real ) zeros , and @xmath2 is a positive integer .",

    "thus the techniques described above for obtaining orthogonality relations for the generated polynomials do not readily lend themselves to the solution of our problem .",
    "moreover , the set of polynomials we obtain using such functions are , in general , not simple . in light of these obstructions , we construct a proof which establishes that each @xmath5 has at least as many distinct real zeros as its degree . we accomplish this by first proving that there exists a continuous , real valued , strictly increasing function @xmath22 on @xmath23 , when viewed as a function of the argument of a non - real zero of @xmath24 ( lemma [ lem : zfunctheta ] and lemma [ lem : zonto ] ) .",
