    "graphene attracts a great deal of attention , both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite , for its exotic electronic transport .",
    "of particular interest is bilayer graphene  @xcite , which has a unique property that the ( conduction - valence ) band gap is controllable  @xcite by use of external gates or chemical doping .    a particle - hole symmetric tower of landau levels and the presence of some zero - energy levels are features specific to graphene in a magnetic field .",
    "bilayer graphene supports eight such zero - energy levels , which , as a tunable band gap develops , evolve into two nearly - degenerate quartets separated by the band gap .    in this paper",
    "we would like to report some unusual properties of such an isolated quartet of pseudo - zero - mode levels , especially , coherence and collective excitations in the presence of an in - plane electric field @xmath0 and the coulomb interaction  @xcite .",
    "we focus on revealing further controllable features in bilayer graphene and point out the following :    \\(1 ) the pseudo - zero - mode levels , especially at half filling , support , via orbital level mixing , charge carriers with a nonzero electric dipole moment . as a result , fine splitting of the pseudo - zero - mode quartet",
    "is also externally controlled by an in - plane electric field or by an injected hall current .",
    "\\(2 ) the interplay of the coulomb interaction and an external field leads to rich spectra of collective excitations , ( orbital ) pseudospin waves .",
    "monolayer graphene supports as charge carriers massless dirac fermions with a linear dispersion . in bilayer graphene interlayer coupling modifies the intralayer `` relativistic '' spectra to yield , in the low - energy branches , massive quasiparticles@xcite , which , in a magnetic field @xmath1 , lead to a tower of landau levels @xmath2 of energy @xmath3\\ , \\omega_{\\rm c}^{\\rm bi } \\sqrt{|n| ( |n| -1 ) } ,    \\label{specnonzero}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] labeled by integers @xmath4 , the center coordinate @xmath5 with the magnetic length @xmath6 and the characteristic cyclotron energy @xmath7 $ ] mev ( with @xmath1 in tesla ) .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 levels have zero energy , and , with a band gap @xmath10 , evolve into two sectors of nearly - degenerate pseudo - zero - mode levels ( separated by a band gap and in valley ) , with spectra @xmath11 where @xmath12\\ , u \\ll u$ ] denotes a fine splitting within each sector .",
    "-0.5 cm    the presence of the zero - energy levels and their double - fold degeneracy ( per spin and valley ) have a topological origin .",
    "this degeneracy is affected by a band gap @xmath13 and an external field @xmath14 .",
    "accordingly , the pseudo - zero - mode levels have an intrinsic tendency to be degenerate , but its fine structure depends sensitively on the environment .    the purpose of the present paper is to study such controllable features of the pseudo - zero - mode quartet in the presence of external fields and coulomb interactions .",
    "we are particularly interested in the properties of this quartet at half filling , where mixing of the pseudo - zero - modes may take place . for definiteness",
    "we focus on the @xmath15 sector at one valley , i.e. , around filling factor @xmath16 ( or @xmath17 when the spin is resolved ) , and ignore the presence of other levels which are separated by relatively large gaps .",
    "the pseudo - zero - mode levels of our interest contain two different landau orbitals @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( per spin ) .",
    "let us put these modes , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , into a two - component spinor @xmath22 , and define the pseudospin operators in the @xmath23 orbital space , @xmath24 with pauli matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 ; @xmath27 .",
    "the charge density @xmath28 projected to the @xmath23 sector is thereby written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the relevant part of the bilayer hamiltonian governing the electrons in the @xmath23 sector is written as @xmath34 where @xmath14 stands for an external potential and @xmath35\\ , u$ ] for the fine level splitting .",
    "one can equally write @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the in - plane electric field .",
    "for the coulomb interaction one can retain only the intralayer interaction since the pseudo - zero - modes at each valley essentially lie on the same layer , @xmath38 where @xmath39 with @xmath40 and the substrate dielectric constant @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we study the properties of the pseudo - zero - mode levels at half filling , using the projected hamiltonian @xmath42 , with focus on orbital mixing of the zero - modes .",
    "let us suppose that the half - filled state @xmath43 is given by a configuration where the pseudospin points in a fixed direction in pseudospin space , i.e. , @xmath44 and @xmath45 with the total number of electrons @xmath46 . for @xmath47",
    "we use the parametrization @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath53 corresponds to the filled @xmath18 level while @xmath54 represents the filled @xmath19 level .",
    "the direction @xmath55 would , in general , vary in response to the external field @xmath14 , and , as @xmath56 tilts from @xmath57 , the @xmath18 and @xmath19 levels start to mix . for selfconsistency",
    "we assume that @xmath14 represents a uniform in - plane electric field @xmath58 and that it leads to a homogeneous state @xmath43 of uniform density @xmath59 ( with @xmath16 for the spin - degenerate @xmath16 state ) .",
    "we thus consider all configurations with @xmath60 and single out the ground state or the associated @xmath47 by minimizing the energy @xmath61 .",
    "the calculation of the coulomb energy @xmath62 , in particular , requires the knowledge of pseudospin structure factors @xmath63 , which , for the present half - filled state with pseudospin @xmath64 , are given in ref .  [ 5 ] .",
    "the energy is conveniently written in @xmath65 space as @xmath66 with @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is an in - plane unit vector ; @xmath70 sets the scale of the coulomb exchange energy . in the present notation @xmath71 stands for energy per electron in state @xmath43 .",
    "note first that the half - filled pseudo - zero - mode state has an in - plane electric dipole moment @xmath72 of strength @xmath73 per electron , proportional to the in - plane component @xmath74 of the pseudospin .",
    "mixing of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 modes gives rise to this dipole .",
    "note also that the coulomb correlation energy @xmath75 is symmetric about the @xmath76 axis @xmath77 .",
    "it alone favors @xmath78 , the filled @xmath18 level , and varies continuously by an amount @xmath79 as @xmath56 sweeps in pseudospin space .",
    "the coulomb interaction thus significantly enhances the splitting of the pseudo - zero - mode levels .",
    "obviously the energy is lower when when @xmath80 , or @xmath81 .",
    "accordingly it is convenient , without loss of generality , to suppose that the in - plane field @xmath0 and @xmath82 lie along the @xmath83 axis , @xmath84 . with this choice",
    "the `` 1 '' , `` 2 '' and `` 3 '' axes in pseudospin space coincide with the @xmath83 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 axes in real space , respectively .",
    "we henceforth adopt this choice and set @xmath87 .",
    "let us explore stable configurations of the half - filled zero - mode state in the next section and here study collective excitations over a given ground state @xmath88 .",
    "we focus on a special class of low - energy collective excitations , pseudospin waves , that are rotations about the energy minimum @xmath88 in pseudospin space .",
    "such a collective state is represented as a texture state @xmath89 locally tilts the pseudospin from @xmath56 by small angle @xmath90 .",
    "the energy @xmath91 of the excited state is a functional of @xmath92 , and serves as an effective hamiltonian .",
    "the associated lagrangian is neatly written as @xmath93 actual calculation is made in a systematic way if one notes that the pseudospin operators @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ smup ] ) obey the su(2)@xmath95 algebra .",
    "the result is an effective lagrangian of the form  @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 go to zero for @xmath100 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath101 of pseudospin waves is in general anisotropic in @xmath102 and depends critically on the stable - state configuration @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , @xmath103 and @xmath104 . with @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    ", our @xmath101 precisely reproduces an excitation spectrum derived in ref .",
    "@xcite by assuming spatial isotropy .",
    "note here that the coulomb interaction alone yields @xmath107 .",
    "this implies that , unlike in ordinary bilayer quantum hall systems , there is no cost of interlayer capacitance energy .",
    "coherence is thus easier to form in the pseudo - zero - mode sector of bilayer graphene .",
    "let us now examine orbital configurations of the half - filled pseudo - zero - mode state and the associated pseudospin waves .",
    "note first that the coulomb correlation energy @xmath108}\\ { \\rm mev } \\label{deltaec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a typical value @xmath109 sets the basic energy scale ; here @xmath110 effectively takes account of the effect of screening coming from vacuum ( dirac - sea ) polarization  @xcite , specific to graphene . in ratio the intrinsic zero - mode level gap @xmath111 and",

    "let us begin with the case where @xmath0 is absent .",
    "( i ) for @xmath116 ( though rather unrealistic ) , one finds @xmath117 at @xmath118 , i.e. , the filled @xmath19 level is realized .",
    "the pseudospin waves have a finite energy gap @xmath119 and the spectrum is isotropic .    on the other hand , ( ii ) for @xmath120",
    ", one finds @xmath117 at @xmath121 ; @xmath122 varies from 0 to @xmath123 with increasing @xmath124 . here",
    "we encounter a somewhat strange situation : the rotational invariance ( about the applied field @xmath125 ) is spontaneously broken and the pseudospin waves are gapless .",
    "this actually signals an instability . in this @xmath124 range",
    "the assumed ground state @xmath43 , taken to be homogeneous in space , acquires spontaneous in - plane electric polarization @xmath126 . such electrically - polarized _ homogeneous _ configurations ,",
    "unless polarization is relatively weak , are unstable against local charge inhomogeneities and would decay into _ inhomogeneous _ configurations . we thus speculate that the half - filled state in the realistic @xmath120 range may form many domains about local charge excesses for stabilization .",
    "\\(iii ) the in - plane field @xmath127 tilts the pseudospin toward @xmath128 and competes with @xmath129 .",
    "the charge carriers thereby acquire a nonzero electric dipole moment @xmath130 and the pseudospin waves always have a finite excitation gap . the potential instability of the texture state , mentioned in ( ii ) , weakens and eventually disappears for large @xmath131 . in fig .  2 we plot the excitation gap @xmath132 as a function of @xmath131 for some typical values of @xmath133 $ ] and @xmath134 $ ] ; @xmath132 falls in the frequency range of microwaves .    , in units of mev and ghz , plotted as a function of the in - plane field @xmath135 for some typical values of magnetic field @xmath133 $ ] and band gap",
    "@xmath136 $ ] .",
    "dashed curves refer to the cases where the screening effect is turned off , @xmath137 . ]",
    "if @xmath0 is sufficiently strong , a sizable gap @xmath132 would arise , leading to an incompressible @xmath16 state .",
    "one could thereby observe the ( spin - degenerate ) @xmath16 hall plateau with a suitably strong injected current .",
    "@xmath0 is practically strong for @xmath138 , where @xmath139 with @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "it would be a challenge to directly detect the pseudospin - wave excitation gap by microwave absorption or reflection experimentally .",
    "one may follow ref .",
    "[ 5 ] and derive the optical conductance due to transitions within the @xmath23 sector , @xmath142 which , with disorder taken into account , is significantly peaked around @xmath143 .",
    "note that the optical conductance is spatially anisotropic , with the larger component @xmath144 perpendicular to @xmath0 ( or along an injected current ) .",
    "zero - mode landau levels , specific to graphene in a magnetic field , deserve attention in their own right . in bilayer",
    "graphene they evolve , with a tunable band gap , into two quartets of nearly - degenerate pseudo - zero - mode levels , which , unlike in monolayer graphene , involve two different orbital indices @xmath145 .",
    "one would thus expect interesting quantum phenomena of orbital level mixing .    in this paper",
    "we have studied the effects of an external field and the coulomb interaction on the pseudo - zero - mode quartet .",
    "this quartet , especially at half filling , supports , via orbital mixing , quasiparticles with charge and electric dipole , which give rise to characteristic collective excitations , pseudospin waves .",
    "the pseudospin - wave excitation gap @xmath132 is generally small , reflecting the intrinsic degeneracy of the pseudo - zero - mode levels , but turns out to depend sensitively on an in - plane field @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the gap @xmath132 is tunable by an in - plane field or by an injected current .",
    "an experimental signature of the field - induced gap is to observe the quantum hall effect with an injected current ; one would be able to resolve the @xmath146 hall plateaus ( or the spin - resolved @xmath147 plateaus ) using a suitably strong current .",
    "a direct study of the excitation gap @xmath132 and its field dependence by microwave absorption or reflection would also clarify the unique controllable features of the pseudo - zero - mode sector in bilayer graphene .",
