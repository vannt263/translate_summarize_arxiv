    "electromagnetic ( em ) form factors of the hadron are fundamental objects , for they characterize the internal structure of the composite particle .",
    "there were a lot of experimental results on em form factors of baryons @xcite and mesons @xcite in the past decades .",
    "due to the complexity of their structure , theoretical investigations on baryons received much less attention than those on mesons , and the existing studies on em form factors of baryons were mainly focused on the nucleon . in comparison with the nucleon , so far as we know , there are no experimental data for @xmath1 at present .",
    "therefore , it is instructive and necessary to study its em form factors theoretically . fortunately , there have been experimental result on the magnetic moment and other model - dependent theoretical results on em form factors to test our estimation indirectly .",
    "van cauteren @xmath4 @xmath5 have investigated the electric and magnetic form factors of strange baryons in the relativistic constituent - quark model @xcite .",
    "the chiral perturbation theory @xcite and the chiral quark / soliton model @xcite have been used to investigate the @xmath1 em form factors at low momentum transfer .",
    "the present work is devoted to investigate the @xmath1 em form factors at moderately large momentum transfer and estimate its magnetic moment theoretically .",
    "the matrix element of the em current between the initial and final @xmath1 baryon states can be parameterized in terms of the dirac and pauli form factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath8\\lambda(p),\\label{form}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the em current relevant to the baryon . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the four - momenta of the initial and final @xmath1 baryon states , @xmath12 is the @xmath1 mass , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the momentum transfer ( outgoing photon momentum ) , and @xmath15 is the @xmath1 spinor . from the experimental point of view ,",
    "dirac and pauli form factors are described equivalently by another set of form factors : electric @xmath16 and magnetic @xmath17 sachs form factors : @xmath18 the normalization of the sachs form factors at @xmath19 is given by the baryon charge @xmath20 and magnetic moment @xmath21 .",
    "in the breit frame , @xmath16 corresponds to the distribution of the electric charge and @xmath17 to the magnetic current distribution .    to give the em form factors ,",
    "qcd sum rule method from a three - point correlation function is a useful tool .",
    "however , the three - point sum rule has a deficiency which restricts its application and accuracy @xcite . instead of it , the light - cone sum rule ( lcsr )",
    "method , which has firstly been employed on the nucleon by braun @xmath4",
    "@xmath5 @xcite , is utilized to study the @xmath1 em form factors in this paper .",
    "lcsr , a hybrid of the traditional sum rule ( svz sum rule ) @xcite and the theory of hard exclusive processes , is a useful method to include both hard scattering and soft contributions in qcd .",
    "it was developed in late 1980 s by making a partial resummation of the operator product expansion ( ope ) to all orders @xcite .",
    "the main difference between svz sum rule and lcsr is that the short - distance wilson ope in increasing dimension is replaced by the light - cone expansion in terms of distribution amplitudes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) of increasing twist .",
    "the @xmath1 baryon distribution amplitudes , which are the fundamental input parameters in lcsr , have been given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we give a little correction to the nonperturbative parameter @xmath22 which has different sign compared with that in ref . @xcite . to leading order in the qcd coupling @xmath23",
    ", we give the @xmath24-dependence em form factors of @xmath1 in the range @xmath25 considering contributions up to twist @xmath0 .",
    "another aim of this manuscript is to estimate the @xmath1 magnetic moment . as important intrinsic physical values",
    ", the magnetic moments of baryons have been investigated theoretically in the past years by various models @xcite . among these models ,",
    "qcd sum rule is widely used . the conventional way to calculate the magnetic moments of hadrons in qcd sum rule",
    "is to deal with the two - point correlation function in the background of the electromagnetic field at zero momentum transfer .",
    "this is the developed qcd sum rule method proposed by balitsky @xmath4 @xmath5 @xcite and ioffe",
    "@xmath4 @xmath5 @xcite . in their method",
    ", the correlation function is expanded in a constant weak external electromagnetic field @xmath26 , and the sum rule of the term connected with the magnetic moment can be gotten directly . this method has been widely used in calculating the magnetic moments of hadrons @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", another approach is adopted to evaluate the @xmath1 magnetic moment .",
    "the basic idea of the approach is to extract the magnetic moment from the calculated em form factors indirectly .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic form factor divided by the magnetic moment can be described by the dipole formula : @xmath27 since there are no experimental data available for the form factor , the result is fitted by the above dipole formula , and the two parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 are artificial parameters to be determined simultaneously .",
    "after that , we use the fit to estimate the magnetic moment of the baryon . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have ever calculated the magnetic moment of the @xmath1 baryon with lcsr . in their calculations",
    ", the magnetic moment can be obtained directly .",
    "this comes from the fact that they use the photon distribution amplitudes , which allows for the utilization of lcsr at the point @xmath19 .",
    "however , in our case , the working region of the sum rule can not extrapolate to the zero point directly .",
    "hence , we have to estimate it with other approaches .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is devoted to derive the light - cone qcd sum rules of the form factors relevant to the momentum transfer @xmath24 , and the necessary distribution amplitudes needed in the calculation are presented in this section .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is the numerical analysis part in which the magnetic form factor is fitted by the dipole formula , and the magnetic moment is estimated from the fit .",
    "this section also presents the qcd sum rules of the nonperturbative parameters @xmath30 and @xmath22 .",
    "the summary and conclusion are given at the end of this section .",
    "the derivation of the sum rules begins with the following correlation function : @xmath31 where the interpolating current of the @xmath1 baryon field is chosen to be @xmath32 the coupling constant is defined by the matrix element of the interpolating current between the vacuum and the @xmath1 state : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a light - cone vector , @xmath35 , and @xmath30 determines the normalization of the leading twist @xmath1 distribution amplitude .    in order to get the sum rules , the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) needs to be expressed both phenomenologically and theoretically .",
    "on one side , by inserting a complete set of intermediate states with the same quantum numbers as those of @xmath1 , and using the definition of the form factors in eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) and the definition in eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) , the hadronic representation of the correlation function is expressed as follows : @xmath36\\lambda(p)+ ... \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , and the dots stand for the higher resonance and continuum contributions . here",
    "the contraction of the correlation function by @xmath38 is adopted to get rid of contributions which are subdominant on the light cone .    on the other side , the correlation function",
    "is calculated in perturbation theory at large euclidean momenta @xmath39 and @xmath40 in terms of the distribution amplitudes . to the leading order ,",
    "the theoretical side of the correlation function is @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath1 baryon distribution amplitudes are defined by the matrix element of the operator between vacuum and the @xmath1 state .",
    "the leading order distribution amplitudes are expressed as @xmath44 the invariant functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be represented explicitly : @xmath47 the integration measure is defined as follows : @xmath48    as the usual procedure in qcd sum rule , by taking into account the dispersion relation and the quark - hadron duality , the hadronic representation of the correlation function is matched with that calculated on the light cone .",
    "then after making the borel transformation to suppress higher resonance contributions , we get the following light - cone qcd sum rules : @xmath49 here @xmath50 connects with the continuum threshold @xmath51 : @xmath52      it is known that for the nucleon , the leading twist contribution is rather small , while higher twist contributions are dominant @xcite , which is different from cases of mesons .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to consider contributions of the higher twist distribution amplitudes for the calculation of the @xmath1 em form factors .",
    "the usual higher twist contributions come from two different physical origins .",
    "first , as the hard quark propagator will receive corrections when considering the background gluon field , there may come contributions from the four - particle ( and five - particle ) distribution amplitudes .",
    "second , contributions will arise from the matrix element of the three - quark operator in eq .",
    "( [ melement ] ) if we consider other lorentz structures on the light cone @xcite . as the first source",
    "does not play a significant role @xcite , we only consider the second one in this paper .    in the calculation , only axial - like vector lorentz structures contribute , so we merely present the following decomposition of the matrix element of the three - quark operator : @xmath53 as the above distributions do not have a definite twist ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , the invariant functions @xmath54 can be parameterized in terms of distribution amplitudes @xmath55 with a definite twist : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is twist-3 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are twist-4 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are twist-5 , and @xmath62 is twist-6 distribution amplitude .",
    "these distribution amplitudes are scale dependent and can be expanded into contributions of conformal operators . to the leading order conformal spin",
    "accuracy the expansion reads @xcite @xmath63 with the equation of motion , the six parameters can be expressed in terms of two independent parameters @xmath30 and @xmath22 . to the leading order",
    "conformal spin accuracy , they are expressed as @xmath64    considering the definition of eq .",
    "( [ da - def ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqexp ] ) , the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) is calculated up to twist @xmath0 and described explicitly : @xmath65 here the following notation is used for convenience : @xmath66 where the distribution amplitudes with a  tilde \" are defined as @xmath67 these results stem from the partial integration in @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , which is employed to eliminate the factors @xmath70 in the calculation .",
    "now by using the borel transformation and subtraction similarly to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , we arrive at the final sum rules : @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath22 can be determined by the qcd sum rule method .",
    "the sum rules begin with the following correlation functions : @xmath73 where the interpolating currents are @xmath74 and following the standard qcd sum rule procedure , the results are given by @xmath75e^{-\\frac{s}{m_b^2}}ds\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{b}{12}\\int_{m_s^2}^{s_0}(1-x)^2e^{-\\frac{s}{m_b^2}}ds-\\frac43a^2e^{-\\frac{m_s^2}{m_b^2}}+m_sa_s\\int_{m_s^2}^{s_0}e^{\\frac{s}{m_b^2}}ds,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 .",

    "shows that @xmath78 is positive . here",
    "@xmath30 is taken to be positive and the parameters have the following numerical values : @xmath83      before the numerical analysis , we firstly specify the input parameters used in the light - cone sum rules . the mass of the @xmath1 baryon is given by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite : @xmath84 .",
    "the mass of the strange quark is chosen to be @xmath85 , and the continuum threshold @xmath86 .",
    "for the auxiliary borel parameter @xmath87 , a working window in which the results vary mildly is required .",
    "the choice of the borel parameter should satisfy two conditions simultaneously . on the one hand ,",
    "as the higher twist contributions are proportional to terms @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , @xmath87 should be large enough to suppress the higher twist contributions",
    ". on the other hand , @xmath87 can not be too large in case that higher resonance and continuum contributions become dominant . in the calculation ,",

    "it is shown from the figure that the result deviates from @xmath95 when @xmath24 becomes large , which is due to the fact that the absolute value of @xmath17 form factor decreases with @xmath24 , and the influence of the threshold @xmath51 becomes important at large momentum transfer .",
    "[ tabel ] lists results of @xmath1 magnetic moment from various approaches . in comparison with results in tab .",

    "[ fig3](b ) is the @xmath24-dependence of the electric form factor @xmath16 .",
    "the figure shows that the electric form factor changes sign at a finite value of @xmath24 , which means that in the large momentum transfer the massive @xmath96 quark play a more important role in determining the electric density of the baryon .",
    "this is different from that of the neutron @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion has been given in ref .",
    "the difference to our calculation is that the electric form factor is negative at lower @xmath24 in their calculation , while another result from ref .",
    "@xcite within the frame - work of the chiral quark / soliton model showed that at small @xmath24 this form factor is positive , which is in contradiction to the result from ref .",

    "it can be concluded that it is twist @xmath3 but not leading twist contributions that dominate the form factor .",
    "this stems from the structure of the leading order distribution amplitude of the @xmath1 baryon , which is symmetric on the @xmath97 and @xmath96 quark if the mass of @xmath96 quark approaches zero",
    ". contributions of @xmath97 and @xmath96 quark can be canceled by the contribution of @xmath98 quark in the approach .",

    "the magnetic form factor is fitted by the dipole formula to estimate the magnetic moment of the baryon .",
    "our estimation is in accordance with the existing results .",
    "as there lack experimental data on the baryon , we only give theoretical investigations on the form factors as what have been done on nucleons .",
    "analysis on the electric form factor shows that it changes sign at a finite large momentum transfer , which is expected to be tested by the future experiments .",
