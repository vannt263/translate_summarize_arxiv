    "after the higgs boson discovery  @xcite , the precise determination of its properties is one of the mayor goals of run ii of the lhc .",
    "the expected experimental precision in the upcoming years has to be matched by theory predictions .",
    "since the dominant production mechanism for higgs boson production at the lhc is gluon fusion , qcd corrections are the most sizable ones .",
    "in fact , the combined next - to - leading order  ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order  ( nnlo ) corrections amount to the same size as the leading order ( lo ) cross section .",
    "the nnlo prediction still has to be assigned an uncertainty of about @xmath0 which is to one part due to the parton densities and to another part due to unknown higher orders in the perturbation series of the partonic quantity .",
    "therefore , our interest lies in the computation of the partonic cross section to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order  ( n@xmath1lo ) .",
    "gluon fusion is a process induced by quark loops and that is dominated by the top quark .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to work within an effective field theory  ( eft ) where the top quark has been integrated out .",
    "in addition to the ordinary five - flavor lagrangian of qcd , one has to consider the interaction term @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the higgs field , @xmath4 its vacuum expectation value and @xmath5 the matching coefficient between full and effective theory .",
    "the effective coupling operator @xmath6 is composed of the gluon field strength tensor @xmath7 .",
    "lo_eft @xmath8    the transition from the full to the effective theory can be depicted diagrammatically , see fig .",
    "[ fig : eft ] .",
    "the advantage of working within the eft setup is the smaller number of diagrams and their reduced complexity .",
    "there are less loops and less scales that have to be considered simultaneously , as the dependence on the top quark mass @xmath9 is encoded completely in @xmath5 .",
    "eft diagrams therefore depend only on a single dimensionless variable @xmath10 which is the squared ratio of the higgs boson mass @xmath11 and the partonic center - of - mass energy @xmath12 .    for higgs boson production to n@xmath1lo",
    ", the finite matching coefficient @xmath5 is needed to four - loop order , see refs .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath5 is described in ref .",
    "@xcite and can be expressed via the renormalization constant of @xmath13 which is also itself needed to three - loop order , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the computation of higher order corrections to the cross section of a process requires taking into account virtual ( additional loops ) and real ( additional final state particles ) contributions . instead of considering different phase spaces for the final states",
    ", one can employ the optical theorem which relates the total cross section to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude . symbolically : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the total cross section for an inital state @xmath16 to result in a collection of final states @xmath17 and @xmath18 stands for the matrix element for a transition between states ( which are identical for forward scattering ) .",
    "the cutkosky rules in turn relate different contributions to the imaginary part of an amplitude to specific sets of propagators which are set on - shell and thereby `` cut '' .",
    "nnlo_opt - theo @xmath19    figure  [ fig : opt - theo ] exemplifies this technique up to nnlo .",
    "the left - hand side shows the phase space integrals over squared production amplitudes for the higgs boson with up to two additional partons .",
    "the right - hand side shows the corresponding interference diagrams where the cut - line is equivalent to a phase space .",
    "note , the last two diagrams are different cuts of the same amplitude .",
    "this demonstrates the validity just to consider all relevant cuts of the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "working in forward scattering kinematics simplifies the calculation .",
    "the optical theorem allows for common treatment of loop and phase space integrals .",
    "thus , the calculation of imaginary parts has to be performed only for a relatively small set of `` master integrals '' ( the integrals remaining after application of integration - by - parts identities with laporta s algorithm ) .",
    "this approach was first used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the nnlo computation of higgs production . on the other hand , within this method more diagrams with more loops have to be computed and one has only access to a total inclusive cross section , at least in its nave application .",
    "let us give a listing of available results related to the higgs boson production cross section . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts ] we give sample diagrams for the contributions from different cuts at n@xmath1lo .",
    "* the lo cross section ( with exact dependence on @xmath9 ) was computed already in the seventies , see refs .",
    "nlo corrections ( also exact in @xmath9 ) are available for almost twenty years , see refs .",
    "* nnlo corrections were first calculated within the eft in refs .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the soft expansion @xmath20 to high orders was used where already the third order proofed to be valid within an error of @xmath211% . * in refs .",
    "@xcite the expansion in @xmath22 was performed to assess the error within the eft framework which turned out to be of @xmath211% . * combining three - loop splitting functions  @xcite with partonic cross sections to nnlo expanded to higher orders in the dimensional regulator  @xcite , convolution integrals and infrared counterterms could be presented in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the n@xmath1lo scale variation was constructed and found to be of @xmath212% - 8% . *",
    "the three - loop gluon form factor was computed in refs .",
    "@xcite which gives the vv@xmath23 and v@xmath1 contributions .",
    "* for vrv and v@xmath23r contributions ( both exact in @xmath24 ) , see refs .",

    "@xcite more than thirty terms in the soft expansion were reached for the total cross section which is sufficient for phenomenological applications . * in refs .",

    "generally , there is a steep raise in complexity when going to higher loop orders in a specific process . here",
    ", there is only @xmath27 diagram at lo , @xmath28 at nlo , @xmath29 at nnlo and @xmath30 at n@xmath1lo .",
    "the corresponding integrals are classified in `` topologies '' or feynman integral families which are then subject to a reduction algorithm resulting in a set of master integrals .",
    "for the real corrections to higgs boson production @xmath27 topology is needed at nlo , @xmath31 at nnlo and more than @xmath32 at n@xmath1lo .",
    "the number of master integrals is @xmath27 at nlo , @xmath33 at nnlo and more than @xmath32 at n@xmath1lo .",
    "our computational setup is highly automated .",
    "first , we use qgraf  @xcite to generate and a private filter  @xcite to select all relevant feynman diagrams .",
    "we perform two independent calculations , using either the program exp  @xcite or reg to map diagrams to topologies .",
    "the reduction to scalar integrals is then performed with form  @xcite . the reduction to master integrals",
    "is done with rows ( an in - house laporta algorithm ) and fire  @xcite .",
    "the reduction tables can reach a size of up to ten gigabytes .",
    "the private code topoid  @xcite is used to provide input in an automatic fashion for the aforementioned steps .",
    "based on the appearing diagrams , we define a topology as set of propagators allowing for permutations or contractions of propagators and ( linear ) transformations of loop momenta .",
    "topoid can also handle topologies with linearly dependent propagators which are needed to map all appearing diagrams . for the partial fractioning relations and the decomposition into topologies with linearly independent propagtors form code",
    "is generated .",
    "since the momentum space representation of topologies is ambiguous , we employ the feynman representation in a unique form to identify duplicate topologies and also to find a minimal basis of master integrals in the very end .",
    "this form of the feynman representation is also used to obtain all possible symmetries of topologies which is an enormous aid in the laporta reduction .",
    "moreover , topoid is able to handle cuts of feynman diagrams in the sense that all possible ways are detected to set propagators on - shell giving rise to an imaginary part . for details",
    "we refer the interesed reader to  @xcite .",
    "the master integrals are calculated using the technique of canonical differential equations  ( deqs ) , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . in general , one obtains a coupled system of linear first - order deqs for the master integrals .",
    "this system is generated by applying the derivative in a kinematic invariant or mass on the integrand of a master integral and using the reduction procedure subsequently .",
    "we refrain from giving details on the computation of the soft limit @xmath20 which is used as boundary condition and refer instead to ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the last few years",
    "henn  @xcite , advertised a specific form of deqs which can be reached via a basis transformation of the master integrals and cast in the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a vector of master integrals , @xmath36 the fundamental matrix of the deqs , @xmath24 a scaleless variable and @xmath37 the number of spacetime dimensions .",
    "the appeal of this form lies in the factorization of the dependence on the dimensional regulator @xmath38 and the kinematics . in this form",
    "the system can be solved order by order in @xmath38 and one can immediately read off the so - called `` alphabet '' , the set of integration kernels , of the iterated integrals that pose the solutions .    up to nnlo all integrals",
    "can be represented as harmonic polylogarithms  ( hpls ) , denoted @xmath39 , which are defined as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the vector of @xmath42 weights and the @xmath43 are the integration kernels .",
    "on n@xmath1lo , as we will see in section  [ sec : qp ] , hpls are not sufficient anymore and the class of functions needs to be extended .",
    "there are @xmath44 diagrams to be calculated in the @xmath26-channel which we chose to classify into @xmath45 topologies , see fig .",
    "[ fig : qp ] . some of the integrals of only one of these topologies ( the third in the first row if fig .  [",
    "fig : qp ] ) could not be solved in terms of hpls only . in that case",
    "the extended alphabet compared to eq .",
    "yields also the `` letters '' @xmath46 note that all integrals giving solutions of this kind can be traced back to the common graph in fig .  [ fig : bt3 ] .",
    "we refrain from giving any explicit results here , instead we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we described the computation of a contribution to the partonic cross section for higgs boson production via gluon fusion to n@xmath1lo .",
    "that is , the sub - process initiated by two quarks of different flavour .",
    "we obtained analytic results with exact dependence on the higgs boson mass and the partonic center - of - mass energy .",
    "new types of iterated integrals beyond harmonic polylogarithms appear in the final expression .",
    "this work represents an important step towards an exact result for all n@xmath1lo contributions to higgs boson production .",
    "to date only an expansion around the soft limit is available from the literature  @xcite which is , however , sufficient for phenomenology . performing an expansion of our result around the threshold , we find for leading logarithms agreement with the results from ref .",
