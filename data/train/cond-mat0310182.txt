    "inelastic hard sphere models are perhaps the simplest models able to capture the two salient features of granular fluids , namely the hard core repulsion between grains and the dissipation of kinetic energy due to the inelastic collisions .",
    "since many of the equilibrium properties of the 1d elastic hard rods are known in closed analytical form , such a system represents an excellent reference model even for the inelastic case .",
    "let us consider @xmath0 identical impenetrable rods , of coordinates @xmath8 , mass @xmath9 and size @xmath10 , constrained to move along a line of length @xmath1 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "the hard - core character of the repulsive forces among particles reduces the interactions to single binary , instantaneous collision events occurring whenever two consecutive rods reach a distance @xmath11 equal to their length @xmath10 .",
    "when two inelastic hard - rods collide , their post - collisional velocities ( primed symbols ) are related to pre - collisional velocities ( unprimed symbols ) through the rule : @xmath12 where @xmath13 indicates the coefficient of restitution .",
    "the interaction of each particle with the heat - bath is represented by the combination of a viscous force proportional to the velocity and a stochastic force .",
    "then each particle follows the so called kramers dynamics @xmath14 where @xmath3 is the viscous friction coefficient , @xmath15 is a gaussian white noise with zero average and correlation @xmath16 @xmath2 is the `` heat - bath temperature '' and @xmath17 indicates the average over a statistical ensemble of noise realizations .    we have developed a numerical simulation code for hard rods interacting through momentum conserving but energy dissipating collisions . in our simulations",
    "the motion between two consecutive collisions is governed by the dynamics  ( [ kramers1],[kramers2 ] ) .",
    "thus , we determine the instant when the first collision among the @xmath0 particles occurs and change their velocities and positions according to the equations of motion .",
    "the effect of the collision is taken into account by updating the velocities after each collision according to the rule  ( [ collision ] ) .",
    "we tested our code on the elastic case ( @xmath18 ) and checked that our simulations faithfully reproduced the well known properties of the equilibrium hard rod system .",
    "we begin by considering the steady state properties of the model .",
    "the aim is to derive relations connecting the microscopic parameters to the `` thermodynamic '' observables such as temperature and pressure and eventually to obtain an `` equation of state '' relating these two quantities . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we assume that the system is homogeneous , so that its density @xmath19 is constant .      collisions and the kramers dynamics entail that the time derivative of the average kinetic energy per particle is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the granular temperature and @xmath22 is the average power dissipated by collisions , given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the difference between the pre - collisional velocities of the colliding pair .",
    "the average collision time @xmath25 is estimated by assuming a mean free path @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the free volume .",
    "we obtain , in terms of the system density @xmath28 , @xmath29 thus the average power dissipated per grain reads : @xmath30 in order to estimate @xmath31 we assume that @xmath32 since the velocities of the colliding pairs are strongly correlated . thus imposing the solution of eq .",

    "the simulation data refer to @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "( [ tg ] ) , the agreement between @xmath31 extracted by simulations and its theoretical estimate is fairly good .      in a granular system the total pressure , @xmath40 , can be obtained via its mechanical or kinetic definition , i.e. as the impulse transferred across a surface in the unit of time.@xcite the pressure contains both the ideal gas and the collisional contribution ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively ) @xmath43 where the second equality stems from the virial theorem .",
    "@xcite here @xmath44 is the observation time , the sum runs over the @xmath45 collisions and @xmath46 represents the impulse variation due to the @xmath47-th collision .    an approximate formula for @xmath42 can be derived as follows .",

    "we define , even for the inelastic system , the response of the density to a uniform change of the pressure for a fixed value of the heat bath temperature : @xmath59 which is plotted in figure  [ fig_compres ] .",
    "we observe that the response of the inelastic system to a compression is much larger than the corresponding elastic system at the same density , due to the tendency to cluster .     at different densities for inelastic hard rods with coefficients of restitution @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "it is well known , on the other hand , that these system may exhibit strong spontaneous deviations from their uniform state . in this section we shall study fluctuations of the main observables in order to understand the qualitative effect of inelasticity on such a peculiar fluid .",
    "one of the signatures of the inelasticity of the collisions is represented by the shape of the velocity distribution function ( vdf ) , @xmath60 .",

    ". dashed lines indicates the corresponding gaussian fit.,width=302 ]    theoretical , numerical and experimental studies have shown that the vdf for inelastic ( @xmath66 ) gases usually displays overpopulated tails .",

    "we are interested in the quantity @xmath70 as a function of @xmath0 ( at fixed density @xmath19 ) .",

    "this scaling is fairly well verified in figure  [ tempflut ] .     for @xmath77 .",
    "the elastic case agrees with the theoretical prediction @xmath78 , whereas the inelastic case gives a value of the relative fluctuation slightly larger .",
    "the remaining parameters are the same as in figure  [ velocitydistr],width=302 ]    in the case of a granular fluid , @xmath79 is no more gaussian , exhibiting fatter tails , so one observes @xmath80",
    "( for example in the case @xmath37 we have @xmath81 ) .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the scaling @xmath82 of formula  ( [ enerflut ] ) still holds , but with a coefficient larger than @xmath83 .",
    "simulation runs for @xmath37 confirm this prediction ( fig .",
    "[ tempflut ] ) .",
    "the renormalization of the multiplicative constant occurring in the inelastic system could be interpreted also as an `` effective reduction '' of the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , the inelastic system has the tendency to cluster , as it will be shown , and therefore the effective number of independent `` particles '' appears smaller .",
    "another appealing interpretation is that the inelastic systems possesses an effective `` specific heat '' larger than that of elastic systems .",
    "a universal signature of the inelasticity is the presence of correlations between the velocities of the particles .",
    "we measured the structure function of the velocities @xmath73 , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the fourier transform of @xmath73 . in figure  [ velcor ] , we show three @xmath86 corresponding to the elastic ( @xmath87 ) and inelastic system with @xmath38 and @xmath37 .",
    ", for elastic and inelastic systems .",
    "the control parameters are the same as in figure  [ velocitydistr],width=302 ]    as mentioned above , the elastic systems is characterized by uncorrelated velocities and this reflects on a constant structure function",
    ". a certain degree of correlation is instead evident in the inelastic system .",
    "in fact , the inelasticity reduces by a factor @xmath13 the relative velocity of two colliding particles and this leads to an increasing correlation among velocities",
    ". however , the noise induced by the bath competes with these correlations , making the structure function not very steep .",
    "more specifically , @xmath86 can be fitted , in the middle range of @xmath47 values , by an inverse power @xmath88 , while at high @xmath47 values it reaches a constant plateau .",
    "this is the fingerprint of a persistent internal noise ( velocity fluctuations are not completely frozen by inelastic collisions).@xcite      , for elastic and inelastic systems , with the same parameters used before .",
    "the solid line indicates the exponential expected in the elastic case ( see text ) .",
    "the state parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ velocitydistr],width=302 ]    the probability distribution , @xmath89 , of distances between nearest neighbor particles @xmath90 , shown in figure  [ spacingsdistr ] , provides information about the spatial arrangement of the system . in the elastic case one",
    "easily finds @xmath91\\ ] ] for @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "the presence of inelasticity modifies such a simple exponential law in the way shown in figure  [ spacingsdistr ] . in this case",
    ", the probability of finding two particles at small separation increases together with that of finding large voids .",
    "such a picture is consistent with the idea of the clustering phenomenon:@xcite two particles , after the inelastic collision , have a smaller relative velocity and therefore reach smaller distances , eventually producing dense clusters and leaving larger empty regions with respect to the elastic case .    on the contrary ,",
    "the probability distribution of collision times , shown in figure  [ timesdistr ] , appears to always follow the theoretical ( elastic ) form @xmath96 .",
    "apart from a trivial rescaling due to the change of the thermal velocity with @xmath13 , it seems not to depend appreciably on the coefficient of restitution .",
    ".,width=302 ]    such a finding is in contrast with the situation observed in 2d vibrated granular systems  @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is the following : in the inelastic 1d system , there is correlation between the relative velocities and the free - paths ( or free - times ) , otherwise the distribution @xmath97 and @xmath89 would have had the same shape due to the trivial relation @xmath98 , @xmath99 being the the average velocity of the rods .",
    "in particular , the fact that the peak of @xmath89 in @xmath100 does not yield a corresponding peak in the @xmath101 region of @xmath97 suggests that the shorter the distance between particles the smaller their relative velocity .",
    "we turn , now , to the study of the structural properties of the inelastic hard - rod gas , by considering the pair correlation function or the structure factor .",
    "as mentioned in section ii , the virial equation  ( [ pressure2 ] ) relates the pressure of an elastic hard - rod system to its microscopic structure . in the presence of inelasticity",
    ", however , we expect that the tendency to cluster is mirrored by a change in the structural properties of the fluid .",
    "therefore we considered the behavior of the static ( truly speaking steady state ) structure factor @xmath102 e^{ikx}\\ ] ] for different values of @xmath103 and inelasticity .",
    "the spatial structure of the system is determined , as in ordinary fluids , by the strong repulsive forces .",
    "their role is seen in the oscillating structure of @xmath104 .",
    "the inelastic nature of the collisions provides a correction to @xmath104 , which can be better appreciated by studying the small wavelength behavior of @xmath105 which develops a peak at small @xmath47 recalling the ornstein - zernike behavior @xmath106 the coefficient @xmath107 is negative for hard rods , whereas it is positive for the inelastic system .",
    "for hard rods , @xmath105 is known  @xcite and reads : @xmath108 with @xmath109 .     for different values of the coefficients @xmath77 .",
    "notice the growth of the peak at small @xmath47 when @xmath13 decreases.,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : sk ] shows the typical behaviors of @xmath105 for elastic and inelastic systems .",
    "the numerically computed structure factor of the elastic system agrees rather well with equation  ( [ sk_elastic ] ) .",
    "the inelastic system , instead , displays a peak in the small @xmath47 region reflecting the tendency of the fluid to cluster",
    ". the peak increases with inelasticity , demonstrating that the energy dissipation in collisions is responsible for these long range correlations .",
    "incidentally , we comment that such a behavior of @xmath105 could be attributed to the presence of a long range attractive effective potential between the rods , as a result of dynamical correlations.@xcite    mackintosh and williams  @xcite found that , in the case of randomly kicked rods in the absence of viscosity , the pair correlation function decays as an inverse power law , @xmath110 with @xmath111 for @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath114 . correspondingly , one expects @xmath105 to diverge as @xmath115 as @xmath116 , for very inelastic systems .",
    "in other words , the inelasticity leads to long range spatial correlations which are revealed by the peak at small @xmath47 of @xmath105 .",
    "we remark that , in spite of the apparent similarity between the equations of state for elastic and inelastic system , their structural properties are radically different . such a phenomenon is the result of the coupling of the long - wavelength modes of the velocity field with the stochastic non - conserved driving force .",
    "in fact , due to the inelastic collisions , the velocities of the particles tend to align , thus reducing the energy dissipation . on the other hand , these modes adsorb energy from the heat bath and grow in amplitude , and",
    "only the presence of friction prevents these excitations from becoming unstable .",
    "the density field , which is coupled to the velocity field by the continuity equation , also develops long range correlations , and the structure factor displays a peak at small wave - vectors .",
    "one dimensional hard - core fluids exhibit an interesting connection between the microscopic structural properties and diffusive ones . in the present section , we present numerical results for the collective diffusion and for the diffusion of a tagged particle and show how these are connected to the structure .",
    "let us turn to analyze the perhaps simplest transport property of the hard rods system , namely the self - diffusion , i.e. the dynamics of a grain in the presence of @xmath117 partners .",
    "the problem is highly non - trivial since the single grain degrees of freedom are coupled to those of the remaining grains .",
    "such a single - filing diffusion is also relevant in the study of transport of particles in narrow pores .",
    "@xcite    the diffusing particles can never pass each other .",
    "the excluded volume effect represents a severe hindrance for the particles to diffuse .",
    "in fact , a given particle in order to move must wait for a collective rearrangement of the entire system .",
    "only when the cage of a particle expands , the tagged particle is free to diffuse further .",
    "this is a peculiar form of the so called cage effect which is enhanced by the one - dimensional geometry .",
    "in addition , the cage effect produces a negative region and a slow tail in the velocity autocorrelation function .    as an appropriate measure of the self - diffusion , we consider the average square displacement of each particle from its position at a certain time , that we assume to be @xmath101 without loss of generality @xmath118 ^ 2 \\rangle}{n } \\label{eq : msd}\\ ] ]    at an early stage ,",
    "the self - diffusion is expected to display ballistic behavior , @xmath119 , with @xmath120 , before any perturbation ( heat bath and collisions ) change the free motion of particles , i.e. when @xmath121 and @xmath122 .    a system of non - interacting ( i.e. non - colliding ) particles subjected to kramers dynamics  ( [ kramers1],[kramers2 ] ) displays , after the ballistic transient , normal self - diffusion of the form @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "this is well verified in figure  [ fig : diff ] ( circles ) .",
    "lebowitz and percus  @xcite studied the tagged particle diffusion problem for systems governed by non - dissipative dynamics without heat bath and found a diffusive behavior described by @xmath125 with @xmath95 . since @xmath126 one obtains @xmath127    on the other hand , almost in the same years , harris  @xcite studied the behavior of @xmath128 in the case of @xmath0 identical brownian particles with hard - core interactions , i.e. obeying a single - filing condition , and obtained a sub - diffusive behavior increasing as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the single ( noninteracting ) particle diffusion coefficient .    in figure  [",
    "fig : diff ] , we study the self - diffusion @xmath128 for elastic and inelastic systems in the presence of heat bath and viscosity , obtaining two different regimes separated by a typical time @xmath25 . in the first transient regime @xmath131 we we observe the ballistic motion . in the second stage , instead , we expect the sub - diffusive behavior , @xmath132 , predicted by harris and other authors .",
    "the inelastic system displays the same sub - diffusive behavior , but with a multiplicative constant larger than @xmath133 , i.e. at equal times the granular ( inelastic ) fluid has a larger absolute value of @xmath128 .",
    "it is interesting to analyze the connection between this transport property and the compressibility of the system , as remarked by kollmann .",
    "@xcite     for three different systems : one without collisions ( free particles ) , one with elastic collisions and the third with inelastic collisions ( @xmath37).,width=302 ]      we follow alexander and pincus  @xcite argument in order to derive a formula for the self - diffusion and show the connection with the compressibility of the system .",
    "let us consider the two time correlator : @xmath134 we set @xmath135 , where @xmath136 are the nodes of the 1d lattice @xmath137 , ( @xmath138 being the lattice spacing ) .",
    "expanding around @xmath136 @xmath139 hence @xmath140 we assume , now , that the density correlator varies as @xmath141 where @xmath142 ( this is demonstrated in appendix a ) is the collective diffusion coefficient , with @xmath143 .",
    "now , the mean square displacement per particle  ( [ eq : msd ] ) can be written as @xmath144 ^ 2",

    "[ aggiunta ] we find @xmath146 approximating the sum with an integral ( @xmath147 and recalling that @xmath148 we obtain @xmath149 and therefore @xmath150 notice that such a formula in the case of hard - rods is identical to formula  ( [ singlefile ] ) .",
    "we see that the tagged particle diffusion depends on the structure of the fluid . in the granular",
    "fluid the @xmath151 part of the spectrum is enhanced and thus we expect a stronger tagged particle diffusion .",
    "this is what we observe .",
    "physically there are larger voids and particles can move more freely .",
    "let us notice that as far as the collective diffusion is involved the spread of a group of particles is faster in the presence of repulsive interactions than without .",
    "in this paper we have studied a one - dimensional system of inelastic hard - rods coupled to a stochastic heat - bath with the idea that it can represent a reference system in the area of granular gases to test theories and approximations . due to the relative simplicity of the one dimensional geometry we have shown that it is possible to obtain relations between the macroscopic control parameters such as kinetic temperature , pressure and density .",
    "we tested these analytical predictions against the numerical measurements and found a fairly good agreement .",
    "it also appears that many properties of the heated one - dimensional inelastic hard rod system are similar to those of ordinary fluids .",
    "however , when we have considered how various physical observables fluctuate about their equilibrium values , many relevant differences have emerged .",
    "these range from the non - gaussian behavior of the velocity distribution , the peculiar form of the distribution of distances between particles and of the energy fluctuations to the shape of the structure factor at small wave - vectors .",
    "finally , we have found that the diffusive properties of the system are affected by the inelasticity and in particular the self - diffusion is enhanced .    to conclude , in spite of the similarity between ordinary fluids and granular fluids , which has been recognized for many years and has made possible to formulate hydrodynamical equations for granular media in rapid , dilute flow , the presence of anomalous fluctuations in the inelastic case indicates the necessity of a treatment which incorporates in a proper way both the local effects such as the excluded volume constraint and the long ranged velocity and density correlations .",
    "such a program has been partially carried out by ernst and coworkers @xcite , but needs to be completed regarding the description of the fluid structure .",
    "in the case of over - damped dynamics ( i.e. large values of @xmath3 ) one finds that the collective diffusion is given by  @xcite @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the local chemical potential .",
