    "a heat engine harvests work by manipulating energy flow between a hot energy source , a cold entropy sink and a work reservoir .",
    "the generalizations of classical heat engines to the quantum regime , i.e. , quantum heat engines ( qhes ) , have been extensively studied , recently  @xcite .",
    "the working fluid ( or the working substance ) of a qhe is a quantum object , while the heat baths can be classical or quantum .",
    "the cycle operation of a qhe can be governed by the quantum generalizations of some thermodynamical cycles , such as the otto , carnot , brayton and diesel cycles  @xcite , or an autonomous cycle  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that qhes obey the macroscopic dynamics and the classical carnot efficiency is the limit for the efficiency of the qhes when the heat baths are classical  @xcite .",
    "inclusions of the quantum features of the heat baths have lead to several advantages ; a qhe can extract work from a single heat bath and exceed the classical carnot limit by exploiting quantum coherence on the hot heat bath  @xcite .",
    "besides , there are recent statements for the universality of the carnot limit for the case of quantum heat baths  @xcite following the maximum entropy principle  @xcite . several physical systems , such as a single ion  @xcite , ultracold atoms  @xcite , optomechanical systems  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite , circuit and cavity quantum electrodynamic systems  @xcite are proposed as a test bench for qhe implementations ; while there are recent experimental assessments for the quantum thermal devices in a liquid - state nmr platform  @xcite . next to the fundamental explorations and the specific applications , qhes also provide to understand the thermodynamical interpretations of the irreversibility and dissipation in the quantum domain  @xcite .    in the present contribution , we consider an arbitrary spin interacting with a transverse time - dependent magnetic field  @xcite as the working fluid of a quantum otto engine . in the isochoric stages of the cycle ,",
    "the system with a fixed hamiltonian attains a thermal equilibrium with the heat bath , while a finite - time unitary evolution generated by a parametric time - dependent hamiltonian develops the adiabatic stages .",
    "the main consideration is to investigate the role of quantum irreversibility and dissipation in an otto cycle associated with the non - ideal , finite - time quantum transformations during the adiabatic stages .    the rapid change of the energy levels during an adiabatic stage causes , in general , non - adiabatic dissipation , termed as internal friction  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this kind effect is fully quantum mechanical , as it arises when the system hamiltonian at different times do not commute , i.e. , @xmath0\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "intuitively , friction in the adiabats can be considered as the internal resistance to the fast motion of the energy levels while compressing / expanding the working fluid .",
    "a quantum state , initially diagonal in the energy representation ( such as a thermal gibbs state ) , can not follow adiabatically the time - dependent changes in the system hamiltonian .",
    "the system state , therefore , develops coherence in the energy frame .",
    "in such a case , the energy entropy increases and an additional parasitic internal energy is stored in the working fluid .",
    "the additional energy corresponds to the waste ( excess ) heat which is dissipated to the heat baths during the proceeding stages of the cycle .",
    "it is found that the internal friction limits the performance of the thermal heat / refrigerator devices .",
    "particular examples as shown recently , internal friction gradually reduces the work output , operational efficiency and power of several quantum heat engines  @xcite , and puts a strict restriction on the minimum temperature of the cold heat bath over absolute zero that a quantum refrigerator can extract heat from  @xcite .",
    "there are possible strategies to diminish or totally eradicate the internal friction .",
    "the first way relies on the quantum adiabatic theorem and provides a frictionless adiabatic transformation .",
    "the system state follows the instantaneous energy eigenstates , which entails infinitely long times , being , however , in the expense of finite power output , and may open the system to decoherence .",
    "the strategies named as `` quantum lubrication ''  @xcite and `` shortcuts to adiabaticity ''  @xcite are the minimizing strategies for the destructive frictional effects .",
    "the former one  @xcite adds external noise on the control parameters which suppresses the frictional effects , resulting , however , imperfect control of the external parameters during the adiabatic stages .",
    "the latter one  @xcite requires a successful design of a control pulse where at the end of the adiabatic stage the frictional effects are minimized .",
    "the role of internal friction in thermal devices has been recently analyzed in an _ ad hoc _ manner , in which the source of friction is not definite and it is added to the system phenomenologically  @xcite . in our setting , its source is explicit and it is caused by the misalignment between the external transverse and internal longitudinal magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "our main interest is two - fold . on one hand ,",
    "we analyze how the work output and the thermal efficiency are effected by the internal friction . on the other hand , we quantitatively determine the internal friction and its explicit role in the cycle .",
    "we consider four different shaped control fields that generate the adiabatic transformation .",
    "since each driving pulse defines different rate for the transformation of the system hamiltonian , they are found to lead to pronounced effects on the performance characteristic of the otto cycle .",
    "our results reveal that considering different possibilities for a driving pulse allows us to improve the performance of the quantum otto engine , to explore new features of the quantum friction , and to find a solution for the almost frictionless cases in finite time adiabatic transformations .",
    "our considered scheme uses an elementary system ( an arbitrary single spin ) which is easy to implement in nmr setups  @xcite and clearly identifies and fights against the fundamental source of friction ( non - commuting free and control parts of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "we consider a single spin in a time - dependent magnetic field as the working fluid of a quantum otto engine .",
    "the adiabatic branches of the cycle are assumed to be generated by a time - dependent hamiltonian of the form @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the static magnetic field along the @xmath3-axis , while @xmath4 is the time - dependent magnetic field along the @xmath5-axis and changes the system hamiltonian in the adiabats . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the components of the spin angular momentum which obey the standard commutation @xmath8=-ii_y$ ] . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the spin-@xmath9 values , @xmath10 . throughout the paper , we set @xmath11 and the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath12 .",
    "one should remark that our choice of model hamiltonian is not arbitrary .",
    "we want to examine the simplest elementary model , containing the fundamental cause of friction , non - commuting free and control terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , the hamiltonian   is in the generic form commonly used in liquid - state nmr experiments of a single nuclei  @xcite .",
    "we will characterize the quantum otto cycle by investigating the extractable work and its thermal efficiency .",
    "quantum otto cycle consists of two quantum isochoric and two adiabatic processes . in the adiabatic stages ,",
    "the working fluid does not exchange any heat with the surroundings and performs only work , while in the isochoric stages , only heat is transferred .",
    "the work performed or the heat exchanged in the strokes of the cycle can be , therefore , formulated through the change in the internal energy . according to quantum thermodynamical version of the first law of thermodynamics  @xcite , the change in the internal energy is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the internal energy , @xmath15 is the heat added to the system and @xmath16 is the work performed by the working fluid .",

    "the unitary evolution represents a closed system , so the evolution is adiabatic in the sense of the fact that there would be no heat exchange with the surrounding during the process . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum adiabatic theorem is not expected to hold in the system due to the finite - time nature of the adiabatic evolution and the non - commutativity of the free and control terms in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ssh ] ) . as a result , a phenomenon termed as internal ( quantum ) friction arises  @xcite .",
    "as we will show , this has profound influences on the performance characteristic of the otto cycle .",

    "the amount of absorbed heat from the hot heat bath can be then calculated as @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the change of internal energy is zero in the cycle .",
    "therefore , the net extractable work can be given as @xmath50 with thermal efficiency , @xmath51 .",
    "we should stress here that our above approach relies on two presumptions .",
    "we have first assumed the perfect thermalization of the system at the heat bath temperature at the end of the isochores .",

    "it can also be shown to be realized in nmr setups  @xcite .",
    "second , our proposed smooth field - change protocols ensure non - crossings between the adiabatic energy levels . it was shown recently that if level crossing occurs , quasi - static reversible changes are not the optimal processes  @xcite .      in present study",
