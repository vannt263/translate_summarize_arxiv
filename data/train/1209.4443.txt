    "in recent years wang  landau sampling ( wls ) @xcite has became a standard tool in the area of monte carlo investigation of statistical systems and has been successfully applied to an ever increasing number of models and situations . since its introduction , a lot of studies",
    "have been carried over in order to investigate its convergence properties and to refine it @xcite .",
    "the wls finds its natural application to discrete energy models and its use for the study of continuous energy models deserves some care , since it has been found , for example , that a naive `` bin - discretization '' of a continuous energy leads to difficulties that need to be handled with care @xcite .    in a recent publication @xcite a variation on the wls theme , conceived for models with a continuous energy spectrum and based on a local linearization of the logarithm of the density of states ( dos ) ,",
    "has been proposed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate , at numerical level , that the algorithm proposed in @xcite , which will be referred to as the llr sampling , or llrs , is effective for models with a discrete energy spectrum too .",
    "there are in fact no _ a priori _ reasons the algorithm proposed in @xcite should not work for discrete energy models , at least in the infinite volume ( or thermodynamic ) limit , in which the energy density , and accordingly the dos , becomes in any case continuous .",
    "clearly , on general ground , at finite volume discrepancies with respect to a standard wls , at the level of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 depends on the specific observable and @xmath4 is the linear size of the lattice , are expected , but it will be shown that for @xmath4 large enough these finite size effects are small and do not affect a safe extrapolation of physical quantities to the infinite volume limit .",
    "the motivation for applying the llrs to discrete energy models stems from the fact that in some cases the derivative of the logarithm of the dos respect to the energy ( _ i.e. _ the inverse of the microcanonical equilibrium temperature at fixed energy ) is all is needed : in such cases the llrs gives the answer in a direct way and the overall computational cost can be dramatically decreased respect to wls .    in the following the algorithm described in @xcite",
    "will be introduced .",
    "then as a first test the ising model in @xmath1 will be addressed and the algorithm will be used to numerically extrapolate the microcanonical equilibrium temperature for a given energy to the thermodynamic limit ; the comparison with the analytically known result will show that the llrs does not produce systematic errors in the infinite volume limit",
    ". the third step will be the study of the interface free energy in the @xmath1 , @xmath0 potts model by means of the so called maxwell construction , with the help of the wls .",
    "afterwards the same computation will be repeated with the llrs , using larger lattices . at the end",
    "some conclusions will be drawn .",
    "generally speaking , the canonical partition function of a statistical system can be expressed as an integral ( or a sum , for a discrete energy model ) over all allowed energies : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the inverse temperature and @xmath7 is the dos ( the boltzmann normalisation factor is set to 1 through all this paper ) .",
    "it is observed that in general , maybe neglecting the boundaries of the domain of definition , the logarithm of the dos ( _ i.e. _ the microcanonical entropy ) is a smooth function of the energy ( equivalently of the energy density ) ; so smooth , in fact , that becomes meaningful to locally apply a linear approximation and to write @xmath8 + c(e_{0}).\\ ] ] it is understood that this approximation works only if @xmath9 is in the neighbourhood of @xmath10 ; to introduce the notation it can be written that eq .",
    "( [ eq : linapp ] ) works well for @xmath11 , with a suitable choose of @xmath12 .    the general strategy outlined in @xcite",
    "will be now briefly recalled . assuming the energy is restricted to the interval @xmath11 ,",
    "the truncated expectation value of a general observable @xmath13 can be defined : @xmath14 where the normalisation @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 if eq .",
    "( [ eq : linapp ] ) was a perfect approximation then @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : principal1 ] ) could be chosen in order to cancel exactly @xmath7 ; in this case a flat distribution would remain , so that @xmath18 assuming now that a good guess for @xmath19 ( call it @xmath20 ) is known , ignoring higher order corrections and defining @xmath21 , the truncated expectation value of @xmath22 is readily obtained : @xmath23 + { \\cal o}(x^{3}{\\delta e}),\\ ] ] where @xmath24{\\delta e}$ ] .",
    "eq ( [ eq : approx ] ) can now be solved for @xmath19 in order to obtain a better approximation @xmath25 : @xmath26 the game can in principle be iterated up to convergence .",
    "obtaining the truncated expectation value @xmath27 is quite easy : all is needed is an entropic sampling @xcite , restricted to the relevant energy range , with @xmath7 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : linapp ] ) and @xmath19 replaced by @xmath20 .",
    "as a matter of fact , as it is noted in @xcite , it is quite unuseful to obtain a really precise estimate of @xmath27 in order to increase the precision on @xmath25 . in any case the value of @xmath20 , after a suitable thermalisation period , will start to fluctuate around its mean value , but the amplitude of the fluctuations ( _ i.e. _ the variance of @xmath17 ) is of course a function of the number of entropic sampling sweeps used to compute @xmath27 .",
    "a good compromise consists in using a reasonable number of entropic sampling sweeps @xmath28 , and to average @xmath20 over @xmath29 after @xmath30 thermalisation steps .",
    "the above line of reasoning is enough to define the following algorithm to compute @xmath31 for a given value of @xmath10 and a given choice of @xmath12 :    1 .   guess a reasonable starting value for @xmath20 ( @xmath32 ) ; 2 .",
    "compute @xmath27 performing @xmath28 sweeps of entropic sampling with @xmath33 ( the sampling is restricted to the range @xmath34 $ ] ; configurations whose energy is out of this range are simply not taken into account in the averaging process ) ; 3 .",
    "compute @xmath25 by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : iteration ] ) ; 4 .",
    "@xmath35 and iterate ; 5 .",
    "discard the first @xmath30 values of @xmath20 and average the remaining @xmath36 values to obtain an estimate of @xmath19 , which can be directly interpreted as @xmath37 .",
    "the ising model in 2d is the first  choice testbed because of the existence of an analytic solution against which numerical results can be checked . in this case , however , the analytic result at finite volume @xcite are of little help , since the llr sampling as defined above will show finite size effects respect to the `` true '' finite size results for @xmath7 .",
    "this is by no means a problem , since the check will be done against results in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ising model is taken to be @xmath38,\\ ] ] where the sum is over nearest ",
    "neighbours sites and @xmath39 .",
    "the llr sampling defined in the previous section was used in order to compute @xmath19 , with @xmath40 , at several lattice size @xmath4 , in order to proceed to the infinite volume limit . in this limit",
    "@xmath19 should become @xmath41 , a quantity for which an analytic answer is of course known .",
    ".simulations parameters and results for ising model .",
    "values marked with an @xmath42 have not been used in the extrapolation to the infinite volume limit . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the procedure used is the following : the energy range from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , which is the relevant one for studying the phase transition by means of the maxwell construction , has been considered .",
    "the energy range has been divided in sub - intervals of size @xmath4 and for each sub - interval @xmath45 ( and whence @xmath31 ) has been computed .",
    "the main difference respect to the wls computation regards the fact that @xmath31 is not computed for all values of @xmath9 but is only sampled , the sampling interval being @xmath46 : the function is fully reconstructed at the end by means of the same b - spline fit procedure described above . the overall cost in terms of computer time is such that the extension of the computation of @xmath47 to larger lattice sizes is possible in a really reasonable amount of time .",
    "the function reconstruction can be judged in figure [ fig : diff128 ] ( the case @xmath48 being taken as an example ; for all other lattice sizes function reconstruction is of similar quality ) .",
    "once @xmath31 has been reconstructed , maxwell construction can be used to obtain both the critical value of the temperature at finite volume and the value of the interface free energy .",
    "note that the iterating equation for @xmath17 changes with respect to the ising case and becomes @xmath49     for @xmath48 .",
    "continuous line is a cubic b - spline fit reconstruction of the data as described in the text .",
    "dotted horizontal line is the value of @xmath50 computed via the maxwell construction .",
    "errors on data points are smaller  equal than symbols size . ]    several lattice sizes , from @xmath51 up to @xmath52 , have been considered .",
    "simulation parameters ( and results for @xmath50 and @xmath47 ) are in table [ tab : f ] . for each @xmath4 , each run and each value of @xmath9 , @xmath45 has been computed by using @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in each case",

    "the dotted green line represents the analytic known result @xmath56 . ]",
    "the first question to address is the computation of the critical temperature in the infinite volume limit .",
    "as can be seen in table [ tab : f ] and figure [ fig : betac ] is it possible to extrapolate the data to the thermodynamic limit as a linear function in @xmath57 , obtaining a value for @xmath58 very close to the analytically known value : @xmath56 .",
    ", @xmath0 potts model .",
    "data ( red squares ) have been obtained with llr sampling and the use of the maxwell construction .",
    "blue points represent data not used in the extrapolation .",
    "the dotted green line represents the analytic result from @xcite . ]    in figure [ fig : f ] the infinite volume extrapolation of the interface free energy is shown .",
    "note that @xmath59 finite size effects are much bigger with respect to the wls computation . nevertheless , discarding the two smaller lattices and fitting linearly in @xmath59 , a good @xmath60 around 1 can be obtained , and the final result is @xmath61 , which is again compatible with the analytic result of @xcite and with the multicanonical result of @xcite .",
    "in this work it has been shown that also without a fine tuning of simulation parameters ( @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath36 , starting value of @xmath17 , for example ) the algorithm presented in @xcite , which in this paper has been called llrs , can be successfully used with discrete energy models , leading to results for physical quantities which in the statistical accuracy reached do not show systematic effects in the infinite volume limit .",
    "after a short exercise with the ising model , the @xmath1 @xmath0 potts model has been considered and the critical value of the temperature and of the interface free energy have been computed with a good degree of accuracy and a modest computational effort . the main motivation for using llrs instead of wls , in the case of discrete energy models , is the following : @xmath31 , which is the key quantity entering in the maxwell construction , is directly computed and can be fully reconstructed for the whole relevant energy range by a careful sampling ( what is meant here is that @xmath31 can be computed for a sample of the discrete energy set and then safely interpolated ) .",
    "there is also to mention that in this way one can avoid all convergence problems of the energy histogram which have to be taken into account when dealing with wls .    in this work",
    "the possibility to fully reconstruct the dos , @xmath7 , starting from information extracted by llrs , has not been explored . for continuous energy model",
    "a simple integration may suffice , and is limited only by discretisation effects . for discrete energy model , however , a modest extension of the procedure can allow for it",
    ". this will be the subject of a future work .",
