    "quantum state tomography is  for obvious reasons  a procedure of great importance in a large number of experiments involving quantum systems : it amounts to reconstructing an unknown quantum state entirely based on experimental data . in many situations one",
    "indeed aims at identifying what state has actually been prepared in an experiment .",
    "this seems particularly important in the context of quantum information science , where quantum state and process tomography is now routinely applied to small , precisely controlled quantum systems @xcite . yet , needless to say , in a number of other contexts the reliable reconstruction of quantum states is an important aim as well .    for finite - dimensional quantum systems ,",
    "conventional quantum state tomography can be performed by choosing a suitable basis of @xmath1 , i.e. , the operators on the @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space of the system in question .",
    "then , the expectation values of these @xmath3 observables are being measured to some required accuracy , from which one can reconstruct the unknown density matrix @xmath4 .",
    "the same approach , however , is doomed to failure when applied to quantum many - body systems : if one has a many - body system at hand with @xmath5 lattice sites of local dimension @xmath6 , the number of necessary different measurement settings is given by @xmath7 , i.e. , it scales exponentially with the size , rendering the treatment even of reasonably large systems impossible .",
    "techniques of quantum compressed sensing @xcite allow to significantly reduce the required number of measurement settings , if the state is of rank @xmath8 , to @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 denotes asymptotic equality ) .",
    "if @xmath11 , this is an impressive reduction , and gives rise to feasible quantum state tomography in medium - sized quantum systems , but this number is still exponential in the number of sites .",
    "such a scaling can not be overcome without further restriction of the class of possible states , simply because even a pure state needs of the order of @xmath2 parameters to be described .",
    "however , if the state is not only pure but also described by a generic matrix product state ( mps ) , the necessary number of measurements only scales linearly with the system size and is even independent of it for the important special case of translationally invariant mps .",
    "what is more , in several instances the classical procedure to reconstruct the mps matrices from the measurement data is efficient @xcite .",
    "this small number of parameters ought to make tomography an easier task , but in many practical settings involving quantum many - body systems , a serious challenge arises : in most interesting systems it is very difficult if not impossible to directly measure a full operator basis . instead",
    ", merely measurements of some preferred observables might be readily available .",
    "realization of a random quantum circuit by an optical superlattice .",
    "the lattice with the larger period is switched between the two depicted situations , and the lattice depth is changed locally by @xmath12 which is uncorrelated between the lattice sites . ]    in the present work , we propose a solution to this problem .",
    "we do so by combining the action of a suitable random quantum circuit with a measurement of a very small number of different observables ( even a single one can be enough ) .",
    "such random circuits are just becoming a tool of great theoretical importance in several subfields of quantum information theory @xcite .    here ,",
    "we show that they also offer significant technological advantages , in that they allow for the natural implementation of _ complete quantum state tomography _ in systems of ultra - cold atoms using only the techniques of super - lattices and laser speckles .",
    "both techniques have already been experimentally proven to be feasible @xcite . combining these new insights with the above mentioned methods of mps tomography brings , for the first time , full tomography of many - particle systems close to experimental reach .",
    "note that once the state is estimated , one can from this knowledge of course also compute properties such as _ entanglement entropies _ of systems of cold atoms @xcite  but also all other properties that are a function of the quantum state .",
    "needless to say , it still amounts to a very difficult prescription .",
    "but while conventional measurements in ultra - cold bosonic systems amount to measuring certain correlation functions or estimates of the temperature in thermometry , say , the path described here eventually allows for the full reconstruction of an unknown state of a quantum many - body system  a very promising perspective .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : first , we introduce in section [ sec : tomtime ] tomographically complete sets of observables and a generalization of operator bases , called tight frames , and discuss their realization by means of random unitary matrices . in a next step ,",
    "we show in section [ sec : undesign ] how efficient compressed sensing is possible with families of unitary matrices which form approximate unitary @xmath0-designs @xcite . in section [ sec : rand ] , a way to efficiently realize such unitary @xmath0-designs with the help of random quantum circuits is presented , before we discuss the application of this approach to ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices in section [ sec : optlat ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : mps ] shows how , under certain assumptions on the state , tomography is possible with a number of measurements which is linear or constant in the number of lattice sites before a conclusion is given in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "before we turn to the question of how tomography is possible , we provide general conditions for sets of observables to be suitable for reconstructing quantum states . we discuss why tomographic completeness as such is not sufficient and introduce generalizations of operator bases which allow for robust tomography .",
    "we consider a quantum system consisting of @xmath5 subsystems , called ( lattice ) sites which all have local dimension @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a quantum state on the hilbert space @xmath14 with dimension @xmath15 and @xmath16 the set of corresponding normalized observables , i.e. , hermitian matrices @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "in this whole work , we denote by @xmath19 the schatten @xmath20-norm , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the frobenius norm and operator norm respectively .",
    "furthermore , we use the hilbert - schmidt scalar product defined as @xmath23 and the projection on the subspace spanned by some @xmath24 which is defined as @xmath25 noting that a measurement of the expectation value of @xmath26 corresponds to determining @xmath27 , we define the total sampling operator @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a probability measure on @xmath16 .",
    "a finite set of observables is said to be tomographically complete if any two different quantum states have distinct expectation values for some observable : this implies that one can theoretically reconstruct the state if one knows all expectation values .",
    "if @xmath30 has full rank , i.e. @xmath31 , the state @xmath4 can be obtained from @xmath32 by matrix inversion if issues of statistical errors and numerical imprecisions are neglected . for general probability measures",
    "we make use of the subsequent definition .",

    "( [ eq : defw ] ) , is full rank .    in practice ,",
    "not every tomographically complete measure on the observables is necessarily useful : the observables , viewed as vectors in @xmath33 , should not be too unevenly distributed over the sphere .",
    "that is to say , if the ratio between the largest and smallest eigenvalues of @xmath30 is large , small errors in the expectation values can lead to large errors in the reconstructed state .",
    "the ideal situation is that of a tight frame , also known as spherical @xmath34-design :    [ def : tightframe ] a probability measure @xmath29 on the set of 2-norm normalized hermitian matrices @xmath16 is called a tight frame if @xmath35 with @xmath30 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : defw ] ) .",
    "examples for tight frames include any operator basis and the rotationally invariant measure on the 2-norm sphere @xmath16 @xcite . when observables are taken from tight frames , the reconstruction problem is well conditioned and small errors in the expectation values only lead to a small error in the reconstructed state @xcite .",
    "a tomographically complete set of observables must contain at least @xmath3 observables , which might be difficult to measure directly .",
    "we introduce a way to do tomography by performing suitably random unitaries , followed by the estimation of the expectation value for a single observable .",
    "a different but related approach has been employed in ref .",
    "@xcite to perform high - fidelity quantum state reconstruction in situations where the knowledge about the state is not tomographically complete . in the present work ,",
    "the time evolution is a tool to obtain knowledge about the quantum state of the system leaving the question of determining hamiltonians aside @xcite .",
    "switching to the heisenberg picture , the outlined procedure amounts to measuring the time - evolved observables .",
    "simple as this idea is , it allows the economical reconstruction of unknown quantum states , as it turns out :    [ def : inducedobs ] to a measure @xmath36 on the special unitary group @xmath37 and an observable @xmath38 we associate the following induced measure on @xmath16 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 , and @xmath42 denotes the dirac in @xmath43 .",

    "although already a single choice of @xmath129 yields an approximate tight frame , we can use the data corresponding to all @xmath198 , as they are measured anyway , to reduce the necessary number of experiments .",
    "we now discuss how a probability measure on the nearest - neighbor unitaries that is universal can be obtained .",
    "to be as specific and simple as possible , we use the single - band bose hubbard model with hamiltonian @xcite @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 . to realize the parallel random quantum circuit , we make use of the techniques of super - lattices @xcite and speckle patterns @xcite . as the total number of atoms",
    "is conserved and super - selection rules forbid the superposition of states with different particle numbers , we restrict ourselves to particle - number conserving operations .    by using an additional lattice",
    "for which the lattice constant is twice as large , one can change the height of the wells between alternating pairs of site .",
    "this mainly affects the hopping constants @xmath202 and to much less extent the interaction parameter @xmath203 , an effect which we neglect . by choosing the depth of the super - lattice large enough , we get @xmath204 for the non - coupled pairs and @xmath205 for the coupled ones .",
    "such a double - well structure has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to probe correlation functions .",
    "a speckle pattern is created by illuminating an uneven surface with a laser and can be modelled by a spatially fluctuating @xmath12 .",
    "the situation is sketched in figure [ fig : optlat ] . for reasons of simplicity",
    ", we only consider the regime for which the strength of the speckle potential is not correlated over the lattice sites , i.e. , all @xmath12 are independently distributed .",
    "thus , we have a random circuit as in theorem [ obs : randomcircuits ] and we only need to show that the corresponding gates generate a dense set in @xmath206 .",
    "the local gates are @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the time after which the super - lattice is switched and a new realization of the laser speckle is created .",
    "we assume @xmath209 to be gaussian distributed , and we have neglected global phases .",
    "now one can adopt an argument used in ref .",
    "@xcite for showing that the gaussian operations together with a single non - gaussian one allow for continuous - variable quantum computation . for universality to hold ,",
    "one has to generate all operations where the corresponding hamiltonian is a polynomial in the creation and annihilation operators where every monomial must contain an equal number of creation and annihilation operators , i.e. , must be balanced , to ensure particle - number conservation .",
    "this is true as eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) contains all quadratic terms and a single quartic one . since one can generate the entire algebra generated from the original set of hamiltonian by commutation , one can approximate an arbitrary unitary @xcite .",
    "thus , by varying @xmath209 , we can approximate any gate to arbitrary accuracy which implies , by continuity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) universality as in definition [ def : universality ] . by appropriately choosing the distribution from which @xmath81 is chosen ,",
    "the set can be made closed under hermitian conjugation .",
    "now , we can apply theorem [ obs : randomcircuits ] which shows together with theorem [ obs : inducedtf ] that one can perform efficient compressed sensing by using a optical super - lattices , laser speckles , and time - of - flight imaging .",
    "again , no single site addressing is necessary , and still complete tomographic information is obtained .",
    "even though compressed sensing notably reduces the number of necessary measurements , it still scales exponentially with the number of lattice sites . without any further assumption on the state",
    ", this can not be overcome .",
    "however , when the state is described by a generic matrix - product state ( mps ) with a fixed bond dimension , tomography is possible with the number of measurements growing , in general , almost linearly with the system size and being constant for translationally invariant mps .",
    "ground states of gapped hamiltonians which are a sum of terms acting only on a constant number of lattice sites are , generically , of this type @xcite .",
    "the exponential reduction of the necessary number of measurements if the state is a mps is due to the fact that such states are completely determined by their reduced density matrices on all blocks of @xmath136 consecutive sites where @xmath136 only depends on the bond dimension @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an efficient algorithm is given for finding the mps matrices from these reduced density matrices .",
    "note that this procedure only works if an upper bound to the bond - dimension , or , equivalently , to the locality size of the hamiltonian is known .",
    "this is obvious as there could always be long range correlations which do not affect the @xmath136 site reduced density matrices .",
    "let @xmath210 be the dimension of the subsystem under consideration and define the operator @xmath211 be the operator acting as @xmath212 and @xmath213 denote all lattice sites but @xmath214 . as we only want to perform tomography on the lattice sites @xmath214 , we can trace out the remainder of the system . in this case , the tight - frame condition of definition [ def : tightframe ] becomes @xmath215 if additional constraints apply , the condition reads @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the dimension of the matrix block corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath68 of @xmath65 , restricted to the subsystem of @xmath136 lattice sites .",
    "we concentrate on the former case as the second follows in an analogous way and show that a random circuit with a depth which does not depend on the system size can realize such a reduced tight frame : assume @xmath38 to be a sum of traceless observables , each acting non - trivially only on some block of @xmath136 lattice sites . for compressed",
    "sensing to be possible , it is sufficient for @xmath82 to induce , for every @xmath218 , an approximate reduced tight frame with @xmath219 where @xmath87 must be chosen such that @xmath220 , c.f .",
    "( [ eq : defalmosttf ] ) .",
    "this is the case if it is an approximate reduced unitary @xmath0-design with @xmath221 where @xmath222 denotes the channel which acts as @xmath223 on a block of @xmath136 sites starting at @xmath218 and as the identity on the rest of the system . to see that this is true , we calculate @xmath224 which yields the desired result after inserting ( [ eq : wdesign ] ) and applying ( [ eq : appredtfrestricted ] ) .    to show that obtaining such a tight frame is efficiently possible , we adapt theorem [ obs : randomcircuits ] :    [ obs : reduceddesign ]",
    "let the parallel random circuit be as in theorem [ obs : randomcircuits ] .",
    "there exists some constant @xmath132 such that it forms an @xmath87-approximate reduced @xmath136-site @xmath0-design as defined in ( [ eq : appredtf ] ) after @xmath225 steps .    _",
    "proof : _ we show the fast convergence of our random circuit to a reduced unitary @xmath0-design by comparing it with another random circuit which is easier to deal with , see fig .",
    "[ fig : comparecircuits ] . in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gnuk ] ) we denote by @xmath226 the channel corresponding to an application of the parallel quantum circuit to a block consisting of @xmath136 lattice sites starting from @xmath218 . theorem [ obs : randomcircuits ] implies @xmath227 for @xmath225 where @xmath132 is a constant . using that @xmath228 ,",
    "one obtains ( [ eq : appredtfrestricted ] ) , concluding the proof .    ' '' ''    top : parallel random circuit acting on the entire system .",
    "bottom : random circuit used in the proof of theorem [ obs : reduceddesign ] which acts only on the inner sites .",
    "the above circuit randomizes the states of the inner sites not less than the above one . ]",
    "theorem [ obs : reduceddesign ] implies that a random quantum circuit of constant depth is sufficient to perform tomography on a reduced density matrix of constant size .",
    "the number of operations , i.e.  random unitary gates and measurements of expectation values of @xmath38 , does only scale polynomially with the number of lattice sites .",
    "therefore , we regard the quantum part of the protocol as efficient . however , this says nothing about the amount of post - processing needed because the reconstruction of the @xmath136-site reduced density matrices requires the knowledge of @xmath229 for all observables @xmath26 obtained by the realizations of the random quantum circuit .",
    "if one needed to keep track of the evolution of observables on the entire hilbert space this would require an exponential amount of computational resources . to see that this is not a problem in the present situation , we use the fact that @xmath38 is a sum of terms which act non - trivially only on blocks of constant size .",
    "thus , the observables induced by the constant - depth random circuit can be written as @xmath230 where @xmath231 acts non - trivially only on a block of constant size @xmath232 starting with site @xmath129 and where @xmath233 denote all lattice sites but @xmath234 , see figure [ fig : causcone ] . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tttemp1 ] ) , we get @xmath235 which means that one only needs to deal with observables on @xmath5 hilbert spaces which all have dimension @xmath236 not depending on @xmath5 making also the classical part of the protocol efficient .",
    "if the system is assume to be translationally invariant , all reduced density - matrices are equal , reducing the necessary number of measurements to a constant . roughly speaking",
    ", the random circuit transforms a local observable to a reduced tight frame on @xmath136 lattice sites with some influence on @xmath237 sites and none on the rest of the system .",
    "influence region for a local observables .",
    "only the action of the darkly colored gates influences the measured observables . ]      even though the method developed in this section is , in its present form , limited to pure states , it can be naturally extented to mixed states by using recent results on tomography for matrix - product _ operators _ ( mpo ) which are a natural generalization of mps @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that large classes of mpo states can be efficiently reconstructed from the reduced density matrices on a constant number of sites not depending on the system size . as we have presented a method of recovering these objects ,",
    "one directly obtains a way of performing tomography on states in optical lattices which are described be mpo while requiring the same experimental techniques .",
    "in this article , we have presented a new route towards efficient quantum state tomography for quantum many - body systems , specifically for bosons in optical lattices . by using random circuits , which can be implemented by means of super - lattices and laser speckles",
    ", one can avoid the use of tomographically complete local measurements on single sites ( in fact any local addressing )  still complete tomographic knowledge can be achieved .",
    "these are challenging , needless to say , but rely solely on time - of - flight imaging techniques , which are nowadays routinely implemented . without any further assumptions to the state , the number of necessary measurements is optimal up to constants and logarithmic factors in the systems dimension . restricting the set of possible states to matrix product states , both",
    "the number of measurements and the depth of the required random quantum circuit does not at all depend on the system size .",
    "this idea gives rise to the exciting perspective of actually reiably measuring out the full quantum state of a quantum many - body system in the laboratory .",
    "there are a number of questions arising from this : for example , it would be very interesting to compare the performance of the present scheme , which is based on random circuits , with one where the quantum gates are chosen in an optimal way from some set of feasible operations .",
    "while there is not much room for improvements concerning the asymptotic behavior , the performance for small systems might differ notably .",
    "this will be studied extensively by numerical means in forthcoming work .",
    "we hope that this work stimulates further work  both of theoretical and especially experimental kind  in `` quantum system identification '' , in order to innovate ways of rendering quantum state tomography feasible for large quantum systems .",
