    "spectroscopic surveys have revealed that a large fraction of nearby early - type galaxies harbor low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions , or liners ( heckman 1980 ; ho et al .",
    "1997a and references therein ) .",
    "the physical understanding of these sources remains rudimentary , but there are strong indications that at least some liners are weak versions of the seyfert or qso phenomenon , and hence powered by accretion onto a massive black hole .",
    "liners are nonetheless distinct from classical agns in terms of their characteristic ( low ) luminosity , emission - line properties , and broad - band spectral energy distribution ( ho 1999 )",
    ". these differences may follow from fundamental disparities in the accretion process operative in luminous and weak agns .",
    "the study of emission - line behavior on small spatial scales within galaxy nuclei provides one strategy for probing the energetics , dynamics , and structure of liners and related objects . here",
    "we report on observations acquired with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) for the liner ngc  4203 .",
    "the data provide dynamical constraints on a black hole , and reveal line emission that may directly trace an accretion flow in this source .",
    "these observations and future follow - up studies will provide an important framework for testing physical models for the structure of liners , and the nature of black holes in galaxy nuclei .",
    "ngc  4203 was observed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) as part of a spectroscopic survey of nearby weakly active galaxy nuclei .",
    "the full details of this program will be reported elsewhere ( rix et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "ngc  4203 is of s0 morphological type , seen nearly face - on , and its nucleus was classified spectroscopically by ho et al .",
    "( 1997b ) as a liner 1.9 source .",
    "ngc  4203 exhibits a recession velocity of 1088 km s@xmath6 , and we assume a distance for this source of 9.7 mpc ( tully 1988 ) .    _ hst _ observations were acquired on 1999 april 18 ut , with the @xmath7 slit placed across the nucleus at position angle ( pa ) = 105.6 .",
    "two exposures totaling 1630 s and three exposures totaling 2779 s were obtained with the g430l and g750 m gratings , resulting in spectra spanning 3300  5700   and 6300",
    " 6850   with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) spectral resolution for extended sources of 10.9 and 2.2  , respectively .",
    "the telescope was offset by 005 ( @xmath8 1 pixel ) along the slit direction between repeated exposures .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) spectra were bias- and dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , shifted to a common alignment , combined with repeated exposures to obtain single blue and red spectra , cleaned of residual cosmic rays and hot pixels , and corrected for geometrical distortion .",
    "the data were wavelength- and flux - calibrated via standard stsdas procedures .",
    "spectra of the nucleus of ngc  4203 , obtained by coadding the 2-d spectra over the central 025 along the slit , are shown in figure 1 .",
    "this extraction width represents approximately twice the fwhm for the stis point - spread function ( psf ; i.e. , fwhm = 012 ) .",
    "the data show strong , low - ionization forbidden line emission , consistent with the classification of this source as a liner .",
    "the red spectrum displays an additional striking feature in the form of a distinct broad component of h@xmath9 , which contributes prominent high - velocity shoulders to the line profile .",
    "ground - based observations of this source obtained with the palomar 5-m telescope in 1985 and reported by ho et al .",
    "( 1997c ) also show evidence of broad h@xmath9 emission , but in the earlier spectrum the broad component is well represented by a gaussian profile with a fwhm of 1500 km s@xmath6 , far less than the velocity difference of @xmath10 km s@xmath6 between the profile shoulders evident in figure 1_a_.    we examined the properties of the broad h@xmath9 emission in more detail by removing the narrow contributions to the blended line .",
    "a synthetic profile for the narrow emission was constructed from the [ s  ii ] @xmath116716 , 6731 lines , and used to model the lines of [ n  ii ] @xmath116548 , 6583 , and narrow h@xmath9 .",
    "the overall emission feature has a central core that strongly resembles the broad h@xmath9 line seen previously in the palomar spectrum , and we consequently included such a component of `` normal '' broad - line emission , matched to the profile parameters and redshift of the ground - based observation , while fitting the overall blend .",
    "the [ n  ii ] doublet was constrained to the flux ratio of 1:3.0 predicted by atomic parameters , and the line strengths were otherwise adjusted in order to produce the smoothest residual profile .",
    "removal of the narrow lines and central peak of broad h@xmath9 emission results in the h@xmath9 line profile shown at the bottom of figure 1_a_. the profile of the remaining broad pedestal in the 6540  6590   region is sensitive to the details of the decomposition ; however , the profile remains distinctly double - peaked , independent of the scaling for the subtracted components .",
    "the broad feature has a full - width near zero intensity of at least 12,500 km s@xmath6 , and a total flux of @xmath12 erg s@xmath6 @xmath13 .",
    "the line appears centered near the narrow - line redshift , although the profile of the broad feature is highly asymmetric , with stronger emission in the blue peak and a more extended wing on the red side .",
    "similar emission is clearly visible in the profile of the h@xmath14 feature ( fig .",
    "1_b _ ) .",
    "the scaling of the `` normal '' broad h@xmath9 component employed in the profile decomposition is 84% that seen in the earlier palomar observation , which represents reasonable agreement when allowance is made for photometric uncertainties in the ground - based data and ambiguities in the fitting procedure .",
    "the degree to which the broad wings have varied is of considerable interest , given the variability of double - peaked emission reported in some other liners ( e.g. , storchi - bergmann , baldwin , & wilson 1993 ; halpern & eracleous 1994 ; bower et al .",
    "1996 ) . to address this question ,",
    "we conducted tests of the observability of extended h@xmath9 wings in the palomar spectrum . shoulders on the h@xmath9 profile resembling those in the _ hst _ data might have eluded detection in the palomar spectrum if this component was present in 1985 , due to wavelength - dependent focus variations and the strong stellar continuum measured through the relatively large ( 2@xmath15 4 ) ground - based effective aperture .",
    "since we can not say for sure whether the broad shoulders on the balmer lines were present in 1985 , it is unclear whether the appearance of this emission in 1999 represents a transient event or a more stable attribute of ngc  4203 .",
    "the fact that the central core of emission has remained roughly constant suggests that the central source has not changed appreciably , in which case the detection of the broad pedestal of emission probably results primarily from the diminished contamination by starlight in the _ hst _ aperture , rather than intrinsic variability .",
    "_ hst _ has revealed similar behavior in ngc  4450 , observed as part of our survey ( ho et al .",
    "the fact that _ two _ sources out of a relatively small sample of objects surveyed ( 24 galaxies total , of which 8 are liners ) were discovered to have double - peaked emission lines suggests that small - aperture spectroscopy is an important complement to variability studies for uncovering this phenomenon in liners .",
    "the 2-d spectra of ngc  4203 exhibit spatially resolved narrow emission , which is most readily apparent in h@xmath9 and the [ n  ii ] lines .",
    "these features are detected out to a distance of @xmath16  ( 47 pc ) in both directions from the nucleus .",
    "line fluxes and radial velocities were measured as a function of position along the slit , by performing a simultaneous fit with @xmath17 minimization , assuming gaussian line profiles .",
    "the [ s  ii ] lines are visible interior to @xmath1805 from the nucleus , and are included in the fits for that region .",
    "the [ o  i ] @xmath116300 , 6364 lines are prominent in the nucleus but were not included in the fits ; emission in these lines is highly concentrated spatially , and the [ o  i ] profiles are also distinctly broader than those of the other forbidden lines in the red spectrum ( consistent with linewidth vs. critical density correlations reported for other liners ; e.g. , filippenko & halpern 1984 ) .",
    "the continuum underlying the emission features was represented by a straight line , and for columns near the nucleus the broad h@xmath9 emission feature was represented by the combination of three gaussian profiles , which was successful in isolating the narrow - line emission .",
    "the radial velocity of the narrow - line gas is plotted as a function of position in the top panel of figure 2 .",
    "a distinct gradient is seen through the central @xmath1805 , which is steepest in the innermost @xmath18 01 .",
    "velocities level off and show evidence of a significant decline in amplitude at larger distances , possibly due to a warp in the gas disk .",
    "the measurements illustrated in figure 2 make it possible to probe the central mass distribution in this galaxy , which is of particular interest given the activity seen in the nucleus . with only one slit position ,",
    "a number of assumptions are necessary to obtain a well - constrained kinematic model . here",
    ", we assumed ( 1 ) that the gas is orbiting the nucleus in a coplanar disk at the local circular velocity , ( 2 ) the _ stellar _ mass - to - light ratio @xmath19 is spatially constant and the stellar orbit distribution is approximately isotropic , and ( 3 ) the stars dominate the total mass inside a @xmath20 aperture ( see sarzi et al .",
    "2000 for a thorough description of the modeling ) .",
    "we then used the acquisition image taken with stis to derive the deprojected , psf - corrected light distribution : it is well described by a cusp with @xmath21 and a central , presumably nonstellar point source . using the isotropic , spherical jeans equation",
    ", we can predict from @xmath22 the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath23 over a @xmath24 aperture as a function of @xmath19 ; matching the observed @xmath25  km s@xmath6 within this aperture ( dalle ore et al . 1991 ) then dictates the value of @xmath19 , to which we assign a 30% error bar reflecting the geometrical uncertainties in this derivation . for",
    "any assumed @xmath26 one can then solve for the combination of disk inclination and disk major axis that best matches the data .",
    "the lines in the bottom panel of figure 2 represent such a model sequence in @xmath26 where the disk orientation was chosen to optimize the match to the data .",
    "while the ultra - broad h@xmath9 emission implies the presence of a black hole , the formal best fit to the extended rotation curve is for a small black - hole mass ( i.e. , @xmath17 is minimized at @xmath27 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "we thus obtain a formal upper limit of @xmath28 m@xmath1 at  99.7%  confidence .",
    "examination of an archival wfpc2 @xmath29-band image reveals asymmetric patchy absorption suggestive of an inclined ( @xmath30 ) dusty disk with a major - axis pa of @xmath310 .",
    "if this orientation applies to the nebular gas ( as suggested by _",
    "hst _ imaging studies of other liners ; pogge et al .",
    "2000 ) , our slit pa is @xmath32  from the disk minor axis . over this pa range",
    "the projection factors change dramatically , and we can not use the dust lane information directly to constrain @xmath26 .",
    "formally , the @xmath17 obtained with minor axis pa = 15  is much worse than for the best fit above .",
    "we thus must await spectra at additional pas or offsets from the nucleus in order to obtain more direct constraints on the disk orientation and black - hole mass ( e.g. , bower et al .",
    "studies of the velocity field for stars and occasionally gas in the centers of nearby bulge - dominated galaxies have generated a list of strong candidates for supermassive black holes ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; ho 1998 ) .",
    "these studies increasingly suggest that the black - hole mass is correlated with the mass of the stellar bulge in the host galaxy .",
    "we consequently examined the black - hole mass in relation to the bulge mass in the case of ngc  4203 .",
    "this galaxy has a total apparent magnitude of @xmath33 , with @xmath34 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "burstein ( 1979 ) decomposed the @xmath35-band photometric profile of ngc  4203 into an exponential disk and @xmath36-law bulge , and obtained a disk / bulge luminosity ratio of 2.0 .",
    "for a representative mass - to - light ratio of @xmath37 , the corresponding bulge mass is @xmath38 m@xmath1 ; our upper limit of @xmath39 m@xmath1 thus implies a black - hole / bulge mass ratio of @xmath40 .",
    "although this number is rather uncertain , it falls near the low end of previous estimates for normal galaxies ( @xmath310.002  0.006 ; magorrian et al . 1998 ; van der marel 1998 ) and overlaps with estimates derived from reverberation measurements of seyfert nuclei ( wandel 1999 ) . a measurement or more stringent limit on @xmath26 in ngc  4203 would be of interest for gauging whether the black - hole / bulge correlation applies in this source .",
    "the luminous output of the liner in ngc  4203 can be used as a diagnostic of accretion onto the central black hole .",
    "ho et al . (",
    "2000b ) have quantified the broad - band spectral energy distribution for this source , and estimate a total bolometric luminosity for the nucleus of @xmath41 erg s@xmath6 . for the limit on @xmath26 obtained from  the nebular rotation curve , this result implies a ratio to the eddington luminosity of @xmath42 .",
    "this result and the broad balmer profiles in the ngc  4203 nucleus have an appealing consistency in the framework of advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) models for accretion onto the central black hole .",
    "adafs are expected to occur naturally in systems with relatively low accretion rates ( e.g. , see narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1998 for a review ) . for an @xmath9-disk prescription for the accretion flow",
    ", an ion torus will form in the inner disk , and advect a significant fraction of the accretion energy into the black hole , when the accretion rate falls below a critical value , @xmath43 . here",
    "the eddington accretion rate is defined so that @xmath44 . adopting a plausible value of @xmath45",
    "implies that @xmath46 , corresponding to @xmath47 , below which the luminosity is expected to scale as @xmath48 .",
    "the limiting value of @xmath49 in ngc  4203 is in the advection - dominated regime , and corresponds to an accretion rate @xmath50 yr@xmath6 ; an improved constraint on @xmath26 is of obvious interest for testing this physical picture .",
    "adafs can account for many properties of luminous radio galaxies , which often resemble ngc  4203 in displaying broad , double - peaked balmer emission lines ( eracleous & halpern 1994 ) .",
    "these profiles have been modeled in terms of a relativistic disk ( chen & halpern 1989 ) , with predicted properties notably similar to those seen in ngc  4203  specifically , stronger emission in the blue peak than in the red , and a sharper cutoff to the blue shoulder than in the red .",
    "the line emission presumably arises from an outer part of the accretion flow that remains geometrically thin and may be irradiated by the inner ion torus that is characteristic of adafs .",
    "modeling of the emission profile can potentially yield an estimate of the radius at which the transition from thin disk to ion torus occurs , and we defer more detailed exploration of this possibility to a later paper .",
    "alternative explanations exist for the double - peaked balmer lines .",
    "possibilities include emission from bipolar outflows or anisotropically illuminated clouds , from gas surrounding binary black holes , or from a tidally disrupted star or other asymmetric circumnuclear structure ( eracleous et al . 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "studies of double - peaked emission profiles in other liners have revealed evolution in the profiles over time , and such observations can potentially be used to distinguish between these possibilities , and to probe the structure of the accretion flow if a disk is in fact responsible . in the case of ngc  1097 ,",
    "variations in the relative heights of the red and blue line peaks are suggestive of emission from an orbiting ring that is azimuthally asymmetric in its emissivity ( storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "if the elevated blue wing in ngc  4203 arises from an asymmetry of this type , we might expect the peak in emission to eventually oscillate to the red wing .",
    "if the timescale for the asymmetry to propagate matches the orbital timescale , then we can predict a rise in the red wing in @xmath51 years , based on the velocity width of the emission - line shoulders and our bound on the black - hole mass .",
    "periodic variability on other ( probably longer ) timescales may be relevant if the asymmetry propagates as a wave or via precession .",
    "follow - up observations thus may yield further important constraints on the structure and evolution of the accretion disk .",
    "ngc  4203 is the latest addition to a small set of liners that exhibit broad , double - shouldered balmer lines . the discovery of two such objects in our _ hst _ survey ( ngc  4450 being the other ; ho et al .",
    "2000a ) suggests that such emission may be common in liners , but often eludes detection in ground - based apertures for which the contrast with the stellar continuum is weak .",
    "the line profile in ngc  4203 is noteworthy for its resemblance to emission profiles seen in broad - line radio galaxies , which have been interpreted as the signature of a thin outer accretion disk irradiated by an inner ion torus , representing an advection - dominated flow onto a black hole .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  4203 also exhibits spatially resolved emission that can be used to provide kinematic information on the underlying mass distribution .",
    "the existing observations at a single pa can be used to restrict the underlying black - hole mass to @xmath39 m@xmath1 .",
    "the availability of a mass estimate for the black hole is of fundamental importance for studying the physics of the accretion process .",
    "our limiting value for @xmath26 is consistent with a sub - eddington accretion rate and formation of an adaf , although a more stringent limit could challenge this picture .",
    "follow - up observations from space , or with small apertures under good seeing conditions on the ground , will make it possible to improve the estimate of the black - hole mass and study time evolution of the  broad  h@xmath9  emission .",
