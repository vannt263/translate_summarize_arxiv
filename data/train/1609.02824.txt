    "the combinatorial problem of enumeration of dimer covers of graphs ( aka domino tilings ) has attracted interest from a diverse range of perspectives . these include statistical mechanics , combinatorics , and algorithm complexity studies . in their groundbreaking papers , p.  w.  kasteleyn , m.  e.  fisher and h. v. n.  temperley  @xcite , showed that for planar graphs the pure dimer problem admits a simple solution in terms of a pfaffian of what is now known as the kasteleyn matrix .",
    "the pure dimer partition functions is different in this sense from its monomer - dimer extension , for which its evaluation is computationally hard and thus not of simple pfaffian form @xcite .",
    "extensive research has been devoted to various facets of dimer coverings , specially in the case of planar and bipartite graphs .",
    "examples include the close relation between the partition functions of the dimer cover and of the ising model  @xcite , existence of phase transitions  @xcite , structure of the model s correlation functions , the arctic circle phenomenon  @xcite , continuum limits and their description in terms of ( conformal ) field theory .",
    "more on this may be found in the overviews  @xcite and references therein .",
    "+ our main aim here is to present a simple geometric explanation of the pfaffian nature of some of the model s correlation function , through which the model s @xmath0 correlation functions can be determined from just the corresponding two point function . the proofs given here bear close similarity to the methods which have recently been developed for planar ising spin models  @xcite . in analogy to the latter",
    ", the method relies on a combinatorial relation , which is valid for general graphs , combined with topological properties of planar graphs .",
    "it was already noted that for planar graphs the boundary monomer correlation functions , whose explicit definition is restated below , are given by pfaffians of the corresponding @xmath1-point functions  @xcite .",
    "the relation is less simple for the bulk monomer correlation functions , but it was pointed out that these can be written as products of two pfaffians  @xcite .",
    "+ we start by giving an elementary geometric proof of the pfaffian structure of the boundary monomer functions .",
    "the derivation also explains why these functions do not have the pfaffian structure in the bulk .",
    "furthermore , we formulate more explicitly than was done in the literature the model s disorder operators , and show that the expectation values of products of order - disorder operators yield correlation functions which are simultaneously pfaffian throughout the bulk and reduce to the simper monomer correlation functions for sites along a boundary line .",
    "the disorder operators can be viewed as incomplete implementations of the dimer model s @xmath2 gauge symmetry . from this perspective ,",
    "their construction and basic properties are similar to those of the corresponding concept for the ising model , as discussed by l.  p.  kadanoff and h.  ceva  @xcite .",
    "+ the combinatorial and topological arguments presented here parallel the analogous discussion of planar ising model in the introductory sections of @xcite .",
    "an essential tool is a path integral representation of a duplicated system , which is referred to as the double dimer model .",
    "the latter has been studied by r.  kenyon and d.  wilson ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and is related to the monopol - dimer model recently studied in  @xcite .",
    "given a finite graph @xmath3 of vertex set @xmath4 , a perfect matching or dimer cover is a subset of the edge set , @xmath5 , such that every vertex is covered by exactly one edge .",
    "the set of perfect matchings is denoted @xmath6 .",
    "the dimer - cover partition function counts the number of the graph s perfect matchings .",
    "perfect matchings can also be weighted through a complex - valued edge function @xmath7 .",
    "given such an edge weight , the weighted dimer - cover partition function is z _ , k  : =   _ _ _ k ( ) with @xmath8    of particular interest is the effect on the dimer - cover partition function of the removal of a collection of sites , @xmath9 , which are regarded as covered by separate monomers .",
    "the collection of perfect matchings of the remaining vertices is denoted by @xmath10 and z_,k(m )  : =   _ _ ( m ) ( ) stands for the weighted partition function of the monomer - depleted graph .",
    "it should be noted that not all graphs admit a perfect matching . in particular if @xmath11 is of odd cardinality , then at least one of the factors in @xmath12 vanishes . for simplicity",
    ", we shall concentrate in this paper on the case @xmath13 for which the _ monomer correlation function _ for an even collection of disjoint sites @xmath14 is well - defined as [ m_ratio ] s_2n(x_1 , ... , x_2n ) : = _ j=1^n _ x_j _ , k  : =   the variables @xmath15 should be thought of an operator in the functional integral representing the average @xmath16 corresponding to the dimer partition function  @xmath17 .",
    "these variables take a similar role as the spin variables in the related ising model .    in the planar set - up ,",
    "monomer correlations have been studied early on by m.  e. fisher and j.  stephenson  @xcite , who determined the fall - off of @xmath18 on the square lattice @xmath19 for @xmath20 and two monomers in the bulk to behave asymptotically as @xmath21 for large separation ( making the similarity to the ising model even more apparent  @xcite ) .",
    "the values of other special placements of momomer pairs on a square lattice are also known ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in case of the infinite half - lattice @xmath22 ,",
    "the monomer boundary correlations in case @xmath20 have been computed not long ago by v.  b. priezzhev and p.  ruelle  @xcite .",

    "the removal of a site in a finite graph , or equivalently its cover by a monomer , has a drastic effect on the graph s dimer covers : if @xmath23 then for parity reasons the modified graph has no dimer cover .",
    "the removal of an even number of sites does not automatically invalidate the existence of a cover .",
    "its effect on the distribution of the dimer covers may be localized to a collection of random paths linking pairwise the affected sites .",
    "a convenient way to arrive at such a stochastic geometric picture of correlations is to consider the overlay of two sets of dimer covers , one of the original graph and the other of its depleted version resulting in the double dimer model .",
