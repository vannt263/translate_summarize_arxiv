    "a common feature of protostellar accretion discs is their association with collimated , energetic outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these outflows are widely believed to represent centrifugally driven winds that are launched along large - scale , ordered magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such winds could in principle be efficient trasnporters of disc angular momentum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bp82 ) , and it has in fact been argued that there is already observational evidence in several protostellar systems that an outflow of this type carries the bulk of the excess angular momentum from at least some part of the associated accretion disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "protostellar discs are typically weakly ionized , and a certain minimum degree of ionization is required to attain the level of coupling between the matter and the field that enables the vertical magnetic angular - momentum transport mechanism to operate .",
    "[ a similar requirement must be satisfied also to enable radial angular - momentum transport by a small - scale , turbulent magnetic field ; such turbulence could be induced , for example , by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; e.g. @xcite ) . ]",
    "the inherent magnetic diffusivity tends to counter the effects of shearing and advection by the differentially rotating accretion flow and therefore makes it possible for the discs to attain a steady state , at least on the dynamical ( rotation ) time .",
    "the behaviour of a weakly ionized gas can be characterized according to the nature of the dominant diffusivity mechanism for the given density and ionization state : ambipolar , hall , or ohm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ambipolar regime , in which the magnetic field lines are effectively frozen into the ions and drift with them relative to the dominant neutral component , can be expected to dominate over the entire disc cross section in the outermost regions of the disc ( at radii @xmath0au ) and near the disc surfaces at smaller radii . in the hall regime",
    "the magnetic field is frozen into the electrons and drifts with them relative to the ions and neutrals ; this regime could dominate over most of the disc cross sections on scales @xmath1au .",
    "the ohm regime , in which the field lines completely decouple from the charge carriers , could potentially dominate near the disc mid - plane on scales @xmath2au .",
    "( at smaller radii the mid - plane region likely becomes collisionally ionized .",
    ") however , as wind - driving discs typically have comparatively lower column densities and mid - plane densities because of their high angular momentum transport efficiency ( which results in relatively high inflow speeds ) , the low - ionization ohm regime might be curtailed ( or even entirely eliminated ) in such systems .",
    "even if this were to happen , the hall - dominated zone would be unlikely to extend to much smaller radii than estimated above on account of the fact that , at sufficiently large densities , the dominant charge carriers become positively and negatively charged grains of equal mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that no hall current can flow .",
    "the structure of radially localized wind - driving protostellar discs in the ambipolar diffusion - dominated regime was investigated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wk93 ) .",
    "they derived exact solutions that were matched to global , radially self - similar disc - wind solutions of the type introduced by bp82 .",
    "they analysed the disc solutions by using the hydrostatic approximation , in which the vertical velocity component is neglected inside the disc , and obtained useful algebraic relations that led to a set of parameter constraints on physically viable configurations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this analysis was generalized by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) to the hall and ohm diffusivity regimes .",
    "in particular , they found that all the viable solutions correspond to four sub - regimes in the hall domain and three in the ohm domain , with the solutions in each of the identified parameter sectors having distinct physical properties .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to derive exact wind - driving disc solutions that can test these predictions and , more generally , the applicability of the hydrostatic approximation to the description of the salient features of such systems .",
    "we concentrate on the hall diffusivity domain , which , according to the discussion above , should be most relevant ( together with the ambipolar regime already discussed in wk93 ) to the study of the weakly ionized regions of wind - driving protostellar discs . in paper i we formulated the problem in terms of a conductivity tensor , specified by the values of the pedersen , hall and ohm components , and discussed its correspondence to a multifluid formulation for the case where only two charged species ( one positive and one negative ) are present .",
    "our parameter constraints were , in fact , derived in the context of the latter approach . in this paper",
    "we employ the conductivity - tensor formulation for the characterization of the solutions that we derive , but we again employ the multifluid formulation in the analysis .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : local ] summarizes the system of equations that underlies the radially localized disc model and describes the model parameters as well as the boundary conditions on the equations and the method of their numerical integration .",

    "this is a two - point boundary value problem for coupled odes .",
    "eight boundary conditions must be formulated , either at the mid - plane or at the critical ( sonic ) point of the flow , defined as the location where the vertical velocity reaches the isothermal sound speed ( or @xmath63 ) .",

    "we also adopt @xmath68 , which follows directly from the normalization of @xmath21 , and prescribe the radial inward velocity ( measured by the parameter @xmath69 ) .",
    "the six boundary conditions applied at the mid - plane are thus @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72    using these boundary conditions and equations  ( [ eq : r_motiond ] ) , ( [ eq : phi_motiond ] ) and  ( [ eq : e - e])([eq : jphi ] ) , we arrive at the following expressions for @xmath73 and @xmath74 : @xmath75 @xmath76    * at the sonic point * : the sonic point is a singular point of equation  ( [ eq : z_motiond ] ) , so an additional boundary condition is obtained by imposing the regularity condition @xmath77 furthermore , the density at @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 ( see the discussion just before equation [ eq : z_s ] ) .",
    "the density derivative at the sonic point can be obtained by differentiating the numerator and denominator of equation  ( [ eq : z_motiond ] ) ( i.e. by applying lhpital s rule ) , which yields a quadratic equation for @xmath80 . out of the two roots of this equation , we choose the negative one  corresponding to a positive velocity gradient  as expected for a physical solution .",

    "if , however , the guessed value is too low , the vertical velocity reaches a maximum and then begins to decrease with @xmath88 . but a vertically decreasing velocity corresponds to a positive density gradient , which is unphysical for an isothermal disc in which the nonthermal forces acting in the vertical direction ( namely , the vertical components of gravity and of the lorentz force ) tend to compress the gas .",
    "this behaviour of the solutions enables us to bracket the correct value of @xmath67 between two limits .",
    "we then improve on the guessed value using bisection until we are close enough to the physical solution to be able to estimate @xmath89 and hence ( by extrapolating in @xmath88 ) the values of the fluid variables at the sonic point .",
    "the boundary conditions given by equations  ( [ eq : sonic ] ) and  ( [ eq : rs ] ) can then be imposed to obtain the remainder of the disc variables at that location .    to complete the derivation of the full solution , we renormalize @xmath3 by the estimated height of the sonic point ( @xmath90 ) and integrate the equations simultaneously from the mid - plane ( @xmath91 ) and from the sonic point ( @xmath92 ) to an intermediate fitting point ( typically @xmath93 ) while adjusting the guessed values at both locations iteratively until the solution converges .",
    "this procedure is adopted because the integration from the sonic point toward the mid - plane becomes unstable at small values of @xmath94 . in carrying out this numerical scheme ,",
    "it is essential to ensure that @xmath67 attains a value of at least @xmath95 in the bisection runs before attempting to compute the location of the sonic point and the extrapolated values of the fluid variables there .",
    "if this is not done then the estimates of these quantities may not be good enough for the backward integration to the fitting point to be successful .",
    "the methodology described in section  [ sec : local ] is appropriate for determining the initial acceleration of the wind from the surfaces of the disc , but it can not be used to follow the evolution of the outflow on scales where the adopted thin - disc approximation @xmath96 breaks down .",
    "it is , however , necessary to ensure that the obtained wind solution continues to accelerate and passes through the remaining critical surfaces of the problem , which correspond to the alfvn and fast - magnetosonic critical points ( e.g. bp82 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since we can not self - consistently model this process in view of our radially localized formulation of the disc structure , we approximate a global disc  wind solution by matching the disc solution to a global , radially self - similar ( i.e. bp82-type ) wind solution . in our cold - wind approximation",

    "in this paper we continue our study of the viability and properties of weakly ionized protostellar accretion discs that transport their excess angular momentum vertically through the surfaces by means of centrifugally driven winds . in view of the suggestive evidence that this situation is realized in at least some protostellar systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and yet mindful of the fact that the total radial extent of such wind - driving disc regions is still unknown , we consider radially localized disc configurations ( which , however , are joined to a global wind model ) .",

    "wk93 assumed that the charge carriers were singly - charged ions and electrons and focussed on the ambipolar diffusivity regime . in paper",
    "i we extended this model to the hall and ohm diffusivity regimes using the conductivity - tensor formalism , although we reverted to using the multifluid approach employed by wk93 for deriving parameter constraints on physically viable solutions in these regimes .",
    "this derivation generalized the corresponding results of wk93 for the ambipolar diffusivity regime and was similarly carried out in the context of the hydrostatic approximation , in which the vertical velocity component is neglected inside the disc ( which results in several of the differential equations for the disc structure simplifying to algebraic relations ) .",
    "the hydrostatic analysis of paper  i indicated that viable wind - driving disc solutions correspond to four parameter sub - regimes in the hall diffusivity domain and three in the ohm domain .",
    "it also led to analytic estimates of the magnetically reduced ( due to magnetic pressure - gradient ` squeezing ' ) density scale height and of the location of the disc s surface ( where the inflow turns into an outflow ) , as well as of other pertinent quantities .",

    "we characterize the solutions in terms of the conductivity - tensor components ( i.e. the pedersen , hall and ohm conductivities ) . however , to facilitate the comparison with the analytic results of paper  i , which were derived in the framework of the multifluid formulation , we assume that the ratios of these terms are constant with height in the disc and , more specifically , that they scale with the density and field amplitude as @xmath235 , which implies that the matter ",
    "field coupling parameter ( the elsasser number @xmath236 ) is also constant with height . we require the derived solutions to cross the sonic critical surface but we do not continue the integration past that surface ; this is sufficient for the comparison with the analytic results and greatly simplifies the calculations . however , as recapitulated below , we also demonstrate that these solutions can be matched to wind solutions that extend to large distances ( and , in particular , cross the alfvn critical surface ) .",

    "wind - driving disc solutions can not be obtained or are unphysical .",
    "all viable solutions satisfy the constraint @xmath309 ( see equation  [ eq : eta ] ) . physically , this condition expresses the requirement that the mid - plane neutral  ion momentum exchange time be shorter than the disc orbital time .",

    "the magnetic field polarity affects both the properties of the solutions and the extent of the parameter regimes where viable solutions exist when the hall current is dynamically important , reflecting the dependence of the hall conductivity on the sign of @xmath44 . specifically , we confirmed the following dependence of the solutions on the field polarity ( with a positive polarity corresponding to @xmath44 being parallel to the disc rotation vector ) : 1 .",
    "_ hall sub - regimes ( i ) and ( iii)_. the parameter @xmath338 , which is equal to the inverse of the mid - plane ion hall parameter ( equation  [ eq : bebiq ] ) and thus scales inversely with the _ signed _ magnetic field amplitude @xmath234 , is predicted to lie in the range @xmath401 .",
    "we verified that no solutions exist for @xmath402 and that positive- and negative - polarity solutions have distinct properties .",
    "in particular , when the sign of @xmath228 is changed from @xmath403 to @xmath255 and all the other parameter values remain the same , @xmath404 and @xmath405 are increased and the wind outflow rate correspondingly goes down .",

    "furthermore , when the lower limit on the value of @xmath69 , obtained from the requirement that @xmath407 ( the third inequality in table  [ table : constraints ] ) is violated , the computed solutions are found to be unphysical ( in that @xmath81 and @xmath388 start to decrease with @xmath88 above a certain height ) .",
    "we also detail the procedure for obtaining global ( radially self - similar ) ` cold ' wind solutions following the methodology introduced by bp82 .",
    "we compute solutions of this type for a large range of values of the wind model parameters @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath224 ( the normalized mass - to - flux ratio , specific angular momentum and field - line inclination at the disc s surface , respectively ) .",

    "can not be used to follow the propagation of the outflow far from the disc , we match our disc solution to a bp82-type wind solution by adjusting one of the disc model parameters ( @xmath69 ) and iterating on the disc and wind calculations until the full solution converges .",
    "we present illustrative solutions of this type that demonstrate that matched disk / wind configurations can be obtained for parameter values that are very similar to those of the merely transonic solutions employed in our parameter - space analysis .",
    "the accretion process in protostellar discs may involve a variety of angular - momentum transport mechanisms , including , in particular , radial transport by gravitational torques and by mri - induced turbulence . in this paper",
    "we consider only vertical transport by centrifugally driven winds in an attempt to model a radially localized disc region where this mechanism may dominate .",
    "( note , however , that both vertical transport and radial transport  notably mri - induced turbulence  could in principle operate at the same disc radius ; see @xcite . )",
    "as discussed in paper  i , the large - scale , ordered magnetic field envisioned in this scenario could be either interstellar field advected by the accretion flow or dynamo - generated field produced in either the star or the disc . in view of the strong evidence for strong outflows from the inner regions of protostellar discs",
    ", we also neglect alternative modes of angular momentum transport that could be mediated by such a field , including magnetic braking , ` failed ' winds and non - steady phenomena .",
    "our treatment has been deliberately simplified to facilitate comparison with the analytic results of paper  i ; in particular , we assume that the matter is everywhere well coupled to the field ( i.e. @xmath408 ) and that the same conductivity regime applies between the mid - plane and the disc s surface . in reality",
    ", the disc may be weakly coupled between the midplane and some finite height and its diffusivity properties are expected to change with @xmath88 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our approximation should be adequate for representing the behaviour of the dominant diffusivity regime in the well - coupled region of the disc .",
    "however , if a significant fraction of the local column density is magnetically weakly coupled then the vertically averaged properties of the disc ( such as the inflow speed ) could be significantly modified ( see * ? ? ?",

    ", the results presented in this paper confirm the validity of the parameter constraints derived in paper i for physically viable configurations of hall diffusivity - dominated protostellar discs in which centrifugally driven winds dominate the local angular momentum transport .",
    "they also demonstrate that the algebraic expressions derived on the basis of the hydrostatic approximation correctly identify the generic properties of such discs and are useful for clarifying the behaviour of the full numerical solutions .",

    "<S> we analysed the disc structure in the hydrostatic approximation ( vertical motions neglected inside the disc ) and presented exact disc / wind solutions for the ambipolar diffusivity regime . in knigl , salmeron & wardle ( paper i ) we generalized the hydrostatic analysis to the hall and ohm diffusivity domains and used it to identify the disc parameter sub - regimes in which viable solutions with distinct physical properties can be expected to occur . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we test the results of paper i by deriving full numerical solutions ( integrated through the sonic critical surface ) of the disc equations in the hall domain . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm all the predictions of the hydrostatic analysis and demonstrate its usefulness for clarifying the behaviour of the derived solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the outflow solutions can be extended to larger scales ( so that , in particular , they also cross the alfvn critical surface ) by matching the localized disc solutions to global ` cold ' wind solutions of the type introduced by blandford & payne . to facilitate this matching </S>",
    "<S> , we construct a library of wind solutions for a wide range of wind model parameters ; this library is made available to the community .    </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in wardle & knigl , paper i and this work combine to form a comprehensive framework for the study of wind - driving accretion discs in protostellar and other astrophysical environments . </S>",
    "<S> this theoretical tool could be useful for interpreting observations and for guiding numerical simulations of such systems .    </S>",
