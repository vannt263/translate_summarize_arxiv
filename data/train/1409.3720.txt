    "a new signal analysis method has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the idea consists is decomposing the signal using a family of a spatially shifted and localized functions , which are given by the squared @xmath4-normalized eigenfunctions associated to the discrete spectrum of the one dimensional semi - classical schrdinger operator , where the signal is considered as a potential of this operator .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the discrete spectrum consisting of negative eigenvalues and the associated squared @xmath4-normalized eigenfunctions can be used to reconstruct , estimate and analyze the signal .",
    "this method has been denoted in @xcite scsa for * * s**emi-**c**lassical * * s**ignal * * a**nalysis . besides its interesting localization property ,",
    "the scsa method has proved its performance in some applications .",
    "for instance , interesting results have been obtained when applying the scsa method to the analysis of arterial blood pressure signals @xcite and to the analysis of the performance of turbomachinery @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in @xcite , that the scsa method can cope with noisy signals , making this method a potential tool for denoising .",
    "the filtering property of the scsa method is currently under study through in - vivo experiments with magnetic resonance spectroscopy data @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the scsa method is extended to two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "this extension is useful for image representation and denoising .",
    "the considered approach consists in using separation of variables method when writing the squared @xmath4-normalized eigenfunctions of a 2d semi - classical schrdinger operator , where the image is considered as a potential of this operator .",
    "the problem consists then in solving the spectral problem for 1d schrdinger operators and in combining the results for the reconstruction , estimation and denoising of images with an appropriate formula inspired from semi - classical analysis theory @xcite .",
    "this formula can be written as the product of the squared @xmath4-normalized eigenfunctions in both directions .",
    "the idea of using 1d transforms for 2d reconstruction is often used in image processing @xcite , the 2d fourier transform is an example @xcite . as in the 1d case ,",
    "the convergence of this formula when the semi - classical parameter converges to zero is proved for image reconstruction .",
    "we will also show that this method can be used for image denoising and we will illustrate the results through some examples .    in section [ sec2 ] , the 1d scsa method is described . then , in section [ sec3 ] , the 2d scsa formula is presented followed by the convergence analysis when the semi - classical parameter goes to @xmath5 . in section [ sec4 ] , an algorithm based on the spectral problems of 1d schrdinger operators and tensor product",
    "is introduced .",
    "the analysis of some parameters and the use of this algorithm for image representation is illustrated in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "first results on image denoising based on 2d scsa approach are presented in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "finally the last section summarizes and discusses the obtained results .",
    "in this section , we recall the idea behind the scsa method @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following one dimensional semi - classical schrdinger operator : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the semi - classical parameter @xcite , and @xmath9 is a positive real valued function belonging to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is compact . here",
    "@xmath12 denotes the sobolev space of order @xmath13 .",
    "then , the potential @xmath9 can be represented using the following proposition .",
    "@xmath14 [ prop1 ] let @xmath15 be positive real valued function , where @xmath11 is compact .",
    "then , @xmath9 can be represented using the following formula : @xmath16 where @xmath8 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the suitable universal semi - classical constant given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gamma function .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 are the negative eigenvalues of the operator @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the number of negative eigenvalues smaller than @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the associated @xmath4-normalized eigenfunctions such that : @xmath28    if a signal is interpreted as a potential @xmath29 of the schrdinger operator , then the formula @xmath30 can be used for signal analysis and reconstruction . indeed the efficiency of the proposed signal estimation method and the influence of the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 have been studied in @xcite . in particular , as it is described in @xcite and @xcite , the semi - classical parameter @xmath32 plays a key role in this approach .",
    "in fact , when @xmath32 decreases , the estimation @xmath33 improves . since the study of the schrdinger operator in the case where @xmath32 tends to @xmath5",
    "is referred to the semi - classical analysis @xcite , this justifies the name * * s**emi-**c**lassical * * s**ignal * * a**nalysis that we give to this method @xcite .",
    "let us point out that the formula given in ( [ scsahg ] ) is still valid in the case where @xmath34 and it gives good results .",
    "for exemple , the following formula : @xmath35 was successfully used in the analysis of arterial blood pressure signal in @xcite , and the analysis of the performance of turbo machines in @xcite .",
    "from now on , we consider the following @xmath13d semi - classical schrdinger operator associated to a potential @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the @xmath13d laplacien operator , @xmath8 is the semi - classical parameter @xcite , and @xmath39 is a positive real valued function belonging to @xmath40 where @xmath41 is compact .",

    "then , the image has been reconstructed using formula @xmath211 as illustrated in figures [ reconsl ] and [ errorl ] respectively .",
    "figure [ vpn2 ] shows the behavior of the number of negative eigenvalues for all rows and columns .",
    "it is clear that this number decreases when @xmath32 increases .",
    "the figures [ 1egn ] and [ 1egnz ] illustrate the localization property of the first @xmath4-normalized eigenfunctions which corresponds to the largest peak in the image .",
    "the last @xmath4-normalized eigenfunction is given in figures [ 512egn ] and [ 512egnz ] .",
    "it contains several peaks , they represent the details in the image .",
    "as described in the introduction , the novelty of this work is the way we select the set of adaptive functions for image representation and denoising .",
    "comparing to the existing methods , the proposed method uses only negative eigenvalues and associated squared @xmath4-normalized eigenfunctions of the semi - classical schrdinger operator , where the image is considered as a potential of this operator .",
    "this quantities which depend only on the image , represent the two main features which account for the performance improvement .",
    "it has been also shown in the previous section that good results are obtained with a small number of negative eigenvalues ( i.e. ; for @xmath32 large enough ) , this comes from the localization property of the eigenfunctions and the pertinent information that they contain .",
    "in fact the first eigenfunction gives a good localization of the largest peak in the image , the second for the two peaks that follow the largest peak , then as the order of the eigenfunctions increases , the oscillations become more important ( see figure @xmath212 ) so they gives information of the smaller details in the image .",
    "this is a well - known results , indeed , in @xcite we show that the eigenfunctions corresponding to less significant eigenvalues are oscillating having asymptotically a sine behavior describing the details of the signal .",
    "if the signal is noisy , these eigenfunctions will describe the noise components .",
    "so removing these components helps to reduce the noise .",
    "however , because of the nonlinearity of the method , instead of a naive truncation , which may lead to loose information about the signal ( since all the eigenfunctions contain information about the signal ) , an alternative consists in increasing the semi - classical parameter value leading to reduce the number of eigenfunctions and hence reduce the effect of the noise .",
    "we are going to show the efficiency and the stability of this method through some numerical results .",
    "the experiments have been carried out on 2d images which are standard testing images of most state - of - the - art denoising algorithms .",
    "the images are contaminated by additive gaussian white noise with zero mean and different levels of standard deviation @xmath213 ( i.e. ; different values of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) ) , the noise is added using the command matlab @xmath214 .    as a first step and by using only the visual performance , we will show through geometric image that in the denoising process , the scsa method preserves the edges even at high level of noise as illustrated in figures @xmath215 , @xmath216 and @xmath217 .    in the following ,",
    "some results obtained are presented .",

    "the ssim is defined over a local window centered at @xmath148 $ ] and an average over such windows gives a single measure for the entire image , named as mean ssim ( mssim ) @xcite .",
    "figures @xmath233 and @xmath234 show the original image of lena and the noisy one .",

    "we have shown that this approximation becomes exact when the semi - classical parameter @xmath32 converges to zero . however",
    "the number of eigenfunctions increases when @xmath32 decreases , so we have shown through some numerical results that a relatively small number of eigenfunctions ( large enough @xmath32 ) is enough to reconstruct the image which makes this method very interesting for image processing applications like coding .",
