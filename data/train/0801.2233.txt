    "like turbo codes , ldpc codes are pseudo - random codes which are well - known to be channel capacity - approaching .",
    "ldpc codes have been rediscovered by mackay under their binary form and soon after their non - binary counterpart have been studied by davey @xcite .",
    "non - binary ldpc codes have recently received a great attention because they have better performance than binary ldpc codes for short block length and/or high order modulations @xcite .",
    "however , good short length non - binary ldpc codes tend to be ultra - sparse , and have worse convergence threshold than binary ldpc codes .",
    "our main motivation in introducing and studying the new class of hybrid ldpc codes is to combine the advantages of both families of codes , binary and non - binary .",
    "hybrid codes families aim at achieving this trade - off by mixing different order for the symbols in the same codeword .",
    "our resulting codes are called non - binary hybrid ldpc codes because of the mixture of different symbol sets in the codeword .    in @xcite , we have demonstrated the interest of the hybrid ldpc codes by designing codes that compare favorably with existing codes for quite moderate code length ( a few thousands bits ) .",
    "hybrid ldpc codes appear to be especially interesting for low rate codes , @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", we study the asymptotic behavior and properties of hybrid ldpc codes under iterative belief propagation ( bp ) decoding .",
    "the section two of this paper highlights the generality of our new codes structure , and explains why we have focused the asymptotic study on the particular subclass of linear codes . in third and fourth sections , we present the context of the study , and detail symmetry and linear - invariance properties which are useful for the stability condition.this condition is then expressed and analyzed to show theoretic advantages of hybrid ldpc codes",
    "we define a non - binary hybrid ldpc code as ldpc code whose variable nodes belong to finite sets of different orders .",
    "more precisely , this class of codes is not defined in a finite field , but in finite groups .",
    "we will only consider groups whose cardinality @xmath1 is a power of @xmath2 , that says groups of the type @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "thus to each element of @xmath5 corresponds a binary map of @xmath6 bits .",
    "let us call the minimum order of codeword symbols @xmath7 , and the maximum order of codeword symbols @xmath8 .",
    "the class of hybrid ldpc codes is defined on the product group @xmath9 .",
    "let us notice that this type of ldpc codes built on product groups has already been proposed in the literature @xcite , but no optimization of the code structure has been proposed and its application was restricted to the mapping of the codeword symbols to different modulation orders .",
    "parity check codes defined on @xmath10 are particular since they are linear in @xmath11 , but could be non - linear in the product group . although it is a loss of generality , we have decided to restrict ourselves to hybrid ldpc codes that are linear in their product group , in order to bypass the encoding problem .",
    "we will therefore only consider upper - triangular parity check matrices and a specific sort of the symbol orders in the codeword , which ensures the linearity of the hybrid codes .",
    "the structure of the codeword and the associated parity check matrix is depicted in figure [ h ] .",
    "we hierarchically sort the different group orders in the rows of the parity - check matrix , and also in the codeword , such that @xmath12 . to encode a redundancy symbol",
    ", we consider each symbol that participates in the parity check as an element of the highest group , which is only possible if the groups are sorted as in figure [ h ] .",
    "this clearly shows that encoding is feasible in linear time by backward computation of the check symbols .",
    "+ in order to explain the decoding algorithm for hybrid ldpc codes , it is useful to interpret a parity check of a hybrid code as a special case of a parity check built on the highest order group of the symbols of the row , denoted @xmath13 and have a look at the binary image of the equivalent code @xcite . for codes defined over galois fields , the nonzero values of @xmath14 correspond to the companion matrices of the finite field elements and are typically rotation matrices ( because of the cyclic property of the galois fields ) .    in the case of hybrid ldpc codes , a nonzero value is a function that connects a row in @xmath13 and a column in @xmath5 , i.e. , that maps the @xmath1 symbols of @xmath5 into a subset of @xmath1 symbols that belongs to @xmath13 .",
    "such application is not necessarily linear , but in the case it is , its equivalent binary representation is a matrix of dimension @xmath15 .",
    "note that , with the above mentioned constraints , we have necessarily @xmath16 .",
    "it is possible to generalize the belief propagation decoder to hybrid codes , and it has been shown that even for those very specific structures , it is possible to derive a fast version of the decoder using ffts @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider only maps that are linear applications , and hence that have a binary representation , in order to be able to apply all known results on linear codes .",
    "we call the message passing step through @xmath17 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ) _ extension _ when it is from @xmath5 to @xmath13 and _ truncation _ when it is from @xmath13 to @xmath5 .",
    "we first clarify the nature of the non - zero elements of the parity - check matrix of a hybrid ldpc code .",
    "we consider an element @xmath18 of the set of linear _ _ extension__s from @xmath5 to @xmath13 .",

    "the _ truncation _ is defined by    @xmath31    the _ truncation _ @xmath25 of the probability vector @xmath26 by @xmath30 is denoted by @xmath32 and defined by @xmath33    given a probability - vector @xmath25 of size @xmath34 , the components of the logarithmic density ratio ( ldr ) vector @xmath35 associated with @xmath25 are defined as @xmath36 .",
    "+ at channel output , ldr messages are actually logarithmic likelihood ratio ( llr ) vectors .",
    "an edge of the tanner graph of an hybrid ldpc code has four parameters @xmath37 .",
    "a hybrid ldpc code is then represented by @xmath38 which is the proportion of edges connecting variable nodes of degree @xmath23 in @xmath5 , to check nodes of degree @xmath39 in @xmath13 .",
    "thus , hybrid ldpc codes have a very rich parameterization since the parameter space has four dimensions .",
    "let @xmath40 be a llr vector computed at the output of a discrete memoryless channel , and @xmath41 the component of the codeword sent , corresponding to the required value for the data node the edge with message @xmath40 is connected to .",

    "@xmath18 with full rank , is also symmetric .",
    "+ the same lemma holds for _ truncation_. the data pass and the check pass of belief propagation have already been shown to preserve symmetry .",
    "thus , lemma 1 ensures that the hybrid decoder preserves the symmetry property if the input messages are symmetric .",
    "+ : the error - probability of a code in a hybrid family , used on a cyclic - symmetric channel , is independent on the codeword sent .",
    "+ for lack of space , we do not give the proof of this lemma , which is a direct generalization of @xcite .",
    "now we introduce a property that is specific to the hybrid codes families .",

    "used permutation - invariance to derive a stability condition for non - binary ldpc codes , and to approximate the densities of graph messages using one - dimensional functionals , for extrinsic information transfert ( exit ) charts analysis .",
    "the difference between non - binary and hybrid ldpc codes holds in the non - zeros elements of the parity - check matrix .",
    "indeed , they do not correspond anymore to cyclic permutations , but to linear _ extensions _ or _ truncations _ , that we denote by linear applications .",

    "since we consider only cyclic - symmetric channels , we can apply lemma 4 from @xcite .",
    "it ensures that there exists an erasurized channel such that the cyclic - symmetric channel is a degraded version of it , and hence provides a lower bound on the error probability .",
