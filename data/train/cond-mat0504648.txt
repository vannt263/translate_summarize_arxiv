    "the electrons in an isotropic bulk conductor under a very strong magnetic field provides an interesting example of a quasi - one - dimensional electron system .",

    "we thus expect its transport properties to be similar to those of one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron systems .",

    "measurement of the electron transport is much easier than in 1d electron systems , since it can be performed with the use of a bulk specimen .",
    "the tunneling conductance is qualitatively similar to that of a 1d tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) @xcite , except that the parameter of electron - electron interaction is magnetic field dependent , and may be either positive or negative .    those theoretical predictions are experimentally verifiable by low - carrier - density materials such as doped semiconductors . in order to observe interaction effects clearly , in a mql",
    ", the mean free path of electrons has to be much longer than the fermi wavelength .",
    "however , for bulk - doped semiconductors , it is difficult to satisfy that condition .",
    "therefore , we consider semiconductor nanowhiskers as more realistic systems since an extremely high carrier mobility is expected in modulation doped structures .",
    "recently , high - quality semiconductor nanowhiskers with sharp heterojunctions have been realized @xcite .",
    "we study many - body effects on the tunneling conductance in nanowhiskers whose radii are much longer than the larmor radius . in such systems , both bulk and edge states",
    "may contribute to electron transport . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that the contributions of edge states to the tunneling conductance of bulk states can be neglected within the approximation which takes into account only most divergent terms at low temperatures .",
    "however , it was also shown that there can be a situation where the tunneling of electrons in edge states may not be ignored experimentally .    therefore ,",
    "in this report , we study numerically the effects of electron - electron interaction on the tunneling of electrons in edge states .",
    "it will be shown that interaction parameters of edge states are much smaller than those of bulk states .",
    "we consider the semiconductor nanowhisker whose radius is much longer than the larmor radius @xmath0 .",
    "we ignore the spin degree of freedom , assuming that spin of every electron is completely polarized in the direction of the magnetic field @xmath1 .",

    "in such a case the magnetic field is sufficiently strong that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electron density .",

    "this equation should be solved under the two boundary conditions : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , there is no analytical solution and we treat the edge states numerically .    as an example , in the case of @xmath23 nm , @xmath24 @xmath25 , and @xmath26 tesla for gaas , the energy spectrum of the lowest landau subband is shown in fig .",

    "since the fermi wave number of the edge states differs between all modes , only when the electron in the edge state is scattered on the density modulation due to its own mode does logarithmic singularity arise .",
    "therefore , in this section , we investigate the tunneling conductance in a single edge mode ( with only @xmath16 ) .",

    "the effective fermi temperature @xmath58 is very low and the perturbative treatment for the electron - electron interaction is no longer valid because of the low electron density .",
    "moreover , since fermi wave length is very long and the mean free path is short because of the weak screening , we can ignore the scattering effects due to freidel oscillation .",
