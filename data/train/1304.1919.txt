    "photoproduction of meson pairs has attracted much interest as a tool for the study of the excitation spectrum of the nucleon . in the absence of analytic or perturbative solutions of quantum chromodynamics on the energy scale typical for excited states of the nucleon , up till now the experimental results have been mainly interpreted with phenomenological quark models .",
    "although it is evident , that such models can only serve as an approximation of the complicated structure of the nucleon , a comparison to experiment should give some guidance concerning the relevant properties of the interaction .",
    "however , so far this approach has had only limited success . apart from problems with the ordering of some low lying states , already at moderate excitation energies",
    "the match in simple number counting between experiment and models is poor ; many more states are predicted than have been observed @xcite . with a few exceptions , for most combinations of quantum numbers",
    "only the lowest lying state is known experimentally @xcite , while models predict a plethora of higher lying states .",
    "theoretical developments are progressing mainly through advances in lattice gauge calculations and their combination with the methods of chiral perturbation theory for the extrapolation to physical quark masses .",
    "interestingly , first unquenched lattice results for excited nucleon states @xcite , basically ` re - discovered ' the well - known su(6)@xmath5o(3 ) excitation structure of the nucleon with a level counting consistent with the standard non - relativistic quark model .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that these calculations are still at a very early stage and are far from the quality already reached for ground - state properties @xcite .    on the experimental side",
    "the data base may be biased because it was dominated by pion - scattering so that partial wave analyses like @xcite may be insensitive to resonances weakly coupled to the @xmath6 channel .",
    "this has prompted world - wide efforts to study excited nucleon states with photon - induced meson - production reactions .",
    "photoproduction of meson pairs adds an important component to these efforts .",
    "it allows the study of resonances that have no significant direct decay mode to the nucleon ground state via single meson production .",
    "such states decay via intermediate excited states in sequential reaction chains such as @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 nucleon resonances , @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is obvious that for higher lying resonances such processes will be important . as an analogy , in nuclear physics",
    "a restriction to ground - state decays of excited states would result in a very rudimentary picture of nuclear structure",
    ".    for the photoproduction of pion pairs data covering the second resonance region , which includes the @xmath11(1440 ) , @xmath12(1535 ) , and @xmath13(1520 ) states , has been collected with photons of energies up to @xmath140.9 gev .",
    "a smaller number of measurements have been made at higher incident photon energies up to 1.5  gev .",
    "total cross sections , invariant - mass distributions of the @xmath15- and the @xmath16-pairs , and angular distributions have been measured with the daphne , taps , and crystal ball detectors at the mami accelerator in mainz @xcite , at graal in grenoble @xcite , at elsa in bonn @xcite , and with the clas detector at jlab ( with electron beams ) @xcite .",
    "recently , first polarization observables were also measured at the mami accelerator @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the data for the @xmath17 final state in terms of nucleon resonances is given in @xcite in the framework of the bonn - gatchina ( bnga ) coupled channel analysis .",
    "double @xmath3 production is particularly interesting since it has much smaller contributions from non - resonant background processes like pion - pole diagrams , or terms of the @xmath18-kroll rudermann type , than the channels with charged pions .",
    "however , the photoproduction of pseudo - scalar meson pairs off nucleons @xcite is described by eight complex amplitudes as function of five kinematic observables ( for example two lorentz invariants and three angles ) .",
    "measurements of eight independent observables are required ( the helicity asymmetry @xmath19 discussed below can be chosen as one of them ) to extract the magnitudes of those amplitudes . fixing in addition all relative phases",
    "requires in total the measurement of at least 15 observables ( single , double , and triple polarization observables among them ) , all as function of the five kinematic variables . due to finite statistical precision of the results , in practice",
    "even more observables would have to be measured , which is not realistic .",
    "therefore , reaction models are used to extract the most relevant information about nucleon resonances from the measurements .",
    "they use parametrizations for the resonance and background contributions and sometimes coupled channel techniques to combine the results from many meson production reactions , so that the fits become better constraint .",
    "however , even in such a framework results for at least some polarization observables are indispensable .",
    "the results from such model analyses for double @xmath3 production are still controversial even at low excitation energies , where only a few resonances contribute .",
    "different reaction models propose , for example , dominant contributions of the @xmath20 reaction chain @xcite , or of the @xmath21 decay @xcite .",
    "the bnga analysis @xcite finds a large contribution from the @xmath22 state , which is almost negligible in the other models .",
    "the helicity dependence of the cross sections , measured in context with the gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule , @xcite shows a dominance of the @xmath23 component .",
    "this is in line with the excitation of the @xmath13 or @xmath24 states and limits possible @xmath11 contributions .",
    "very recently , kashevarov et al .",
    "@xcite have presented a detailed analysis of the angular distributions .",
    "they argue that in the @xmath13(1520 ) range , and even below , a large contribution of @xmath25 waves is necessary to reproduce the data .",
    "however , they can not identify the nature of this contribution .",
    "possible candidates are a strong d@xmath26(1700 ) excitation ( which , however , is probably in conflict with other isospin channels ) or @xmath27 rescattering effects , which are neglected in most models but may play an important role .",
    "an observable that recently attracted much interest is the beam - helicity asymmetry @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it can be measured for three - body final states such as @xmath28 with circularly polarized photons and unpolarized targets .",
    "models @xcite predicted a large sensitivity to different reaction mechanisms .",
    "this observable is defined by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the differential cross sections for each of the two photon helicity states , and @xmath31 is the degree of circular polarization of the photons . the definition of the angle @xmath32 @xcite in the center - of - momentum ( cm ) system between the reaction plane , spanned by the incident photon and the outgoing recoil nucleon , and the production plane , spanned by the two pions , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : def ] .",
    "note that @xmath32 depends on the numbering of the two pions .",
    "parity conservation imposes on the asymmetry the condition @xmath33 and for identical mesons , like @xmath34 pairs , when the numbering of the two pions is randomized , it must obey in addition @xmath35 this relation does not apply when the two pions are ordered by some kinematic condition , for example by the invariant masses @xmath36 of the pion - nucleon pairs @xmath37 selecting the pion with the larger invariant mass as number one . for the extraction of @xmath38 in a limited region of kinematics , the differential cross sections @xmath30 can be replaced by the respective count rates @xmath39 , since all normalization factors cancel in the ratio . for integrated asymmetries , efficiency",
    "weighted count rates @xmath40 must be used .",
    "previously , this asymmetry has been measured for double pion production for the @xmath41 reaction with clas at jlab up to incident photon energies of 2.3  gev @xcite and for all three isospin states ( @xmath34 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) for the @xmath44 initial state at mami up to photon energies of 0.8  gev @xcite .",
    "these studies found that states are more likelynone of the available reaction models agreed with the asymmetries measured for the reactions involving charged meson production . only for the double @xmath3 channel , which has only small non - resonant contributions ,",
    "reasonable agreement was found @xcite for the models of fix and arenhvel @xcite and the bnga analysis @xcite ; however , the valencia model @xcite failed although it agreed very well with the total cross section and invariant mass distributions .",
    "this demonstrates the impact of such data .",
    "the present experiment concentrates on the neutral channel , extending the measured energy range for @xmath19 for @xmath45 to 1.4 gev , throughout the third resonance region . at the same time it provides the first data for @xmath19 for the @xmath46 reaction",
    "the study of photon - induced reactions off the neutron has recently moved more into focus .",
    "it can yield valuable complementary information since the photoexcitation of nucleon resonances is isospin dependent and some states are more likely excited for the neutron than for the proton ( see @xcite for an overview over this program ) .",
    "the measurements were performed at the tagged photon beam of the mainz mami accelerator @xcite .",
    "longitudinally polarized electron beams with energies of @xmath141.5 gev ( see table . [",
    "tab : beam ] for details ) were used to produce bremsstrahlung photons in a copper radiator of 10 @xmath47 m thickness .",
    "the photons were tagged with the upgraded glasgow magnetic spectrometer @xcite . the typical bin width for the photon beam energy ( 4 mev )",
    "was defined by the geometrical size of the plastic scintillators in the focal plane detector of the tagger .",
    "the polarization state of the beam was switched in a randomized way with a frequency of 1 hz .",
    "possible differences in the number of incident photons for the two helicity states have been determined to be at the 5@xmath4810@xmath49 level , i.e. they are negligible .",
    "the polarization degree of the electron beams was measured by mott and m@xmath50ller scattering .",
    "their longitudinal polarization is transferred in the bremsstrahlung process to circular polarization of the photons .",
    "the polarization degree of the photon beams follows from the polarization degree of the electrons and the energy - dependent polarization transfer factors given by olsen and maximon @xcite .",
    "the size of the tagged photon beam spot on the targets ( @xmath14 1.3 cm diameter ) was restricted by a collimator ( 4  mm diameter ) placed downstream from the radiator foil .",
    "the targets were kapton cylinders of @xmath14 4 cm diameter and different lengths filled with liquid deuterium or liquid hydrogen .",
    "contributions from the target windows ( 2@xmath48120  @xmath47 m kapton ) were determined with empty target measurements , but are negligible for the results discussed in this paper .",
    "data were taken during four different beam times .",
    "their main parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : beam ] .    .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     photons , charged pions , and recoil nucleons produced in the target were detected with an almost @xmath60 covering electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "it combined the crystal ball detector ( cb ) @xcite with the taps detector @xcite .",
    "the cb is made of 672 nai crystals and covered the full azimuthal range for polar angles from 20@xmath61 to 160@xmath61 , corresponding to 93% of the full solid angle .",
    "the taps detector , consisting of 384 baf@xmath62 crystals , was configured as a forward wall , placed 1.457 m downstream from the targets , and covered polar angles from @xmath145@xmath61 to 21@xmath61 .",
    "the crystal ball was equipped with an additional particle identification detector ( pid ) @xcite for the identification of charged particles and all modules of the taps detector had individual plastic scintillators in front for the same purpose ( taps ` veto - detector ' ) .",
    "this setup is similar to the one described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that , in the earlier setup , the taps forward wall consisted of 510 modules and was placed 1.75  m from the target .",
    "the trigger conditions used for the different beam times varied in the required multiplicity of hits in the calorimeter ( between 1 - 3 ) .",
    "this is , however , irrelevant for the present analysis since four - photon events from the @xmath34 final state always fulfilled the trigger conditions .",
    "it had only influence on the experimental dead time , limiting counting statistics for the low - multiplicity runs .",
    "the analysis of double pion production reactions , measured with this setup , is discussed in detail in @xcite . in the analysis ,",
    "events were included with five neutral hits or four neutral and one charged hit , where ` neutral ' and ` charged ' were defined by the response of the pid or the taps plastic scintillator system .",
    "they were taken as candidates for the @xmath17 and @xmath63 final states ( the second event type contributes only for the deuterium target ) .",
    "the analysis proceeded then with the identification of photons .",
    "for the taps detector , photons can be cleanly separated from charged pions and recoil nucleons with the help of the charged particle detectors , a pulse - shape analysis , and a time - of - flight - versus - energy analysis ( see @xcite for details ) . for the cb ,",
    "the separation was done with the pid .",
    "charged pions and protons were identified by a @xmath64 analysis of the signals from the pid and the cb .",
    "distinction between photons and neutrons is not possible for hits in the cb . in the next step ,",
    "identified photons ( from taps ) and photon candidates ( from the cb ) were combined into all possible disjunct pairs and their invariant masses were calculated .",
    "the ` best ' combination was chosen with a @xmath65 test minimizing the deviation of the invariant masses from the nominal rest mass of the @xmath3 . for events with five photon candidates ,",
    "the remaining bachelor was taken as a neutron candidate .",

    "[ fig : invm ] ( bottom left ) .",
    "the background level was very low already after these initial analysis steps .",
    "only events with both pion invariant masses between 110 mev and 160 mev were accepted for further analysis and the nominal mass of the pion was used to improve the resolution . since the angular resolution of the detector system is much better than the energy resolution , this was simply done by replacing the measured photon energies by @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the measured photon energies , @xmath68 the re - calculated energies , @xmath69 is the nominal @xmath3 mass , and @xmath70 the measured invariant mass .    in the next step ,",
    "the reaction kinematics in the cm - system was exploited by a selection on the co - planarity of the two pions with the recoil nucleon .",
    "the azimuthal angle between the cm three - vectors of the recoil nucleon and the combined two - pion system was required to be in the interval ( 180@xmath7120)@xmath61 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : invm ] , bottom right ) .",
    "finally , the recoil nucleons ( although detected ) were treated as missing particles and their mass was computed from the reaction kinematic defining the missing mass @xmath72 by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the nucleon mass , @xmath31 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 are the four - momenta of the incident photon , the initial - state nucleon ( which was assumed at rest , neglecting fermi motion ) , and the produced @xmath3-mesons .    typical results for double @xmath3 production off quasi - free nucleons from the deuterium target are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : missm ] .",
    "the spectra are rather clean , the small background components for recoil neutrons are presumably due to the reaction @xmath77 ; @xmath78 , where one decay photon escaped detection and another one was misidentified as a neutron .    the correct identification of recoil nucleons is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : invm ] , ( top row ) , where the time - of - flight versus energy spectra of neutron and proton candidates in taps and the @xmath64 spectra for proton candidates in the cb are summarized . due to the careful selection of the different reaction types discussed above",

    "the spectra for charged recoil nucleons show no trace of events from charged pions .",
    "the tof - versus - energy correlation for neutron candidates in taps does not show any residue from the proton band .",
    "altogether , no indication of any significant contamination of the proton sample with neutrons or vice versa has been observed .",
    "the asymmetries were constructed from these data samples using eq .",
    "[ eq : circ ] .",
    "overall normalization factors ( beam flux , target thickness , experimental deadtime ) cancel in the ratio",
    ". however , in general , the experimental detection efficiency depends on the reaction kinematics ( polar angles and kinetic energies of pions and recoil nucleons ) so that it does not cancel in ratios integrated over such observables .",
    "this is not much of a problem for the detection of the @xmath3 mesons because the detection efficiency of a @xmath60 calorimeter is rather flat for them .",
    "however , the detection probability for the recoil nucleons is sensitive to their kinetic laboratory energies and thus also to their cm polar angles ( for fixed incident photon energy recoil energy drops with increasing polar angle ) .",
    "therefore , the count rates @xmath39 were replaced by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the experimental detection efficiency .",
    "the latter was constructed by monte carlo simulations with the geant4 code @xcite and applied as function of @xmath81 ( @xmath82 of photon , participant - nucleon pair ) , @xmath32 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : def ] for definition of @xmath32 ) , and the recoil nucleon cm polar angle @xmath83 .",
    "the other kinematical observables were integrated out , using a phase - space distribution for the @xmath84 final state in the event generator .",
    "this assumption is not critical since the detection efficiency is flat as function of these observables and does not much depend on the details of the event generator ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "typical values for the detection efficiency for the reaction with recoil protons were around 20% , but dropped to a few per cent for large polar angles ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "efficiencies around 10% were reached with recoil neutrons .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of the efficiency correction is small , we estimate it below the 5% range . the only further source of systematic uncertainty are the polarization degrees of the photon beam ( see table  [ tab : beam ] ) , which were measured with uncertainties between 5% and 7% .    for the quasi - free measurements , the effects of nuclear fermi motion of nucleons bound in the deuteron must be considered .",
    "they will tend to smear out the asymmetries .",
    "however , as discussed in detail in @xcite , the kinematics of the reaction is completely determined from the measurement of the incident photon energy , the four - vectors of the mesons , and the direction of the recoil nucleon .",
    "it is not necessary to measure directly the kinetic energy of the recoil nucleon .",
    "this is important because kinetic energies of recoil neutrons detected in the cb are not available ( time - of - flight distance is too short for reasonable resolution ) .",
    "the four - vector of the participant ( and also the spectator nucleon ) can be reconstructed from this input so that the ` true ' @xmath81 and the correct cm - system of the photon - participant - nucleon pair are known . in all further analysis steps , final state four - vectors reconstructed this way were used for recoil neutrons and recoil protons .",
    "the validity of this method can be tested by a comparison of the asymmetries extracted for free protons from the hydrogen target to the results for quasi - free protons from the deuterium target .",
    "the asymmetries have been analyzed in two different ways , for a randomized numbering of the two pions and for an ordering with the condition from eq .",
    "[ eq : mmcon ] .",
    "the first analysis was only used for a comparison to the previous results from @xcite for the free proton .",

    "the agreement between the two measurements is excellent .",
    "the results from the second analysis carry more information .",

    "[ eq : sym1 ] : @xmath86 for the ordered pion pairs , eq .",
    "[ eq : sym2 ] is not valid and consequently also the coefficients with odd numbers can contribute .",
    "the coefficients with even numbers are of course identical ( within statistical fluctuations ) to the corresponding coefficients of the analysis with randomized pions .",

    "this is far from trivial since the observable @xmath19 depends in a subtle way on the correlation of the relative angles of all final state particles , which could be easily disturbed by fermi motion or final state interactions .",
    "this result is also encouraging in view of the current experimental program for the measurement of double polarization observables off bound neutrons @xcite , although for each observable and each reaction channel it will be necessary to test first the assumption of unmodified quasi - free production for the proton case .",

    "<S> beam - helicity asymmetries have been measured at the mami accelerator in mainz for the photoproduction of neutral pion pairs in the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 off free protons and off quasi - free nucleons bound in the deuteron for incident photon energies up to 1.4 gev . </S>",
    "<S> circularly polarized photons were produced from bremsstrahlung of longitudinally polarized electrons and tagged with the glasgow magnetic spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> decay photons from the @xmath3 mesons , recoil protons , and recoil neutrons were detected in the 4@xmath4 covering electromagnetic calorimeter composed of the crystal ball and taps detectors . </S>",
    "<S> after kinematic reconstruction of the final state , excellent agreement was found between the results for free and quasi - free protons . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the free - nucleon behavior of such observables can be extracted from measurements with quasi - free nucleons , which is the only possibility for the neutron . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to expectations , the measured asymmetries are very similar for reactions off protons and neutrons . the results are compared to the predictions from the two - pion - maid reaction model and ( for the proton ) also to the bonn - gatchina coupled channel analysis .    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    , </S>"
