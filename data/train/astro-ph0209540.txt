    "nuclear activity in galaxies is present over a wide range of luminosities , from the most distant and powerful quasars , to the weaker active galactic nuclei ( agn ) seen in nearby galaxies such as seyferts , liners and even the milky way ( e.g. , huchra & burg 1992 ; ho filippenko & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "the standard model of nuclear activity involves the release of gravitational potential energy from galactic material accreted by a supermassive black hole at the galaxy center and , although radiation from the central engine is detected across the electromagnetic spectrum , it was the radio emission that first led to the discovery of powerful agn ( e.g. , baum & minkowski 1960 ; hazard , mackey & shimmins 1963 ; bridle & perley 1984 ) .",
    "indeed , the presence of powerful , highly - collimated relativistic radio jets in radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies , extending well beyond their host galaxy ( e.g. , fanaroff & riley 1974 ; bridle & perley 1984 ) , provided key evidence for the exhaust material from a black - hole driven central engine ( scheuer 1974 , blandford and rees 1974 ; bridle et al .",
    "1994 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "in contrast , radio - quiet quasars and seyfert galaxies are ten times more common but 100 to 1000 times weaker at radio wavelengths than their radio - loud cousins ( e.g. , goldschmidt et al .",
    "1999 ) ; consequently nuclear starbursts have been advocated as the primary power source instead of black - hole accretion ( e.g. , fernandes & terlevich 1995 ) . however , instrumental improvements and high resolution radio imaging with the vla , merlin and the vlba over the last twenty years have shown increasing evidence for collimated radio emission in the form of small - scale radio jets that are weak analogues to jets in radio - loud agn ( e.g. ulvestad & wilson 1989 ; wilson 1991 ; nagar et al . 1999 ; kukula et al .",
    "1999 ) and indicate the presence of a central black hole and accretion disk , at least in some seyferts .",
    "similarly , measurements of high brightness temperatures in milliarcsecond resolution images of seyfert nuclei with flat radio spectra have also suggested support for accretion - powered central engines ( mundell et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "radio jets , although interesting in their own right , also provide a valuable probe of the interstellar medium close to the central engine , in particular the putative obscuring torus , which is thought to surround the central engine , providing fuel for the agn and determining the observed optical spectral differences between type 1 ( unobscured , viewed pole - on down the torus axis ) and obscured type 2 ( viewed edge - on in the torus equatorial plane ) ( e.g. , antonucci & miller 1985 ) .",
    "some of the molecular gas in the torus is expected to be dissociated and ionized by the central uv / x - ray continuum source resulting in detectable quantities of neutral and ionized gas ( e.g. , krolik & lepp 1989 ; pier & voit 1995 ) .",
    "absorption of the radio jet continuum emission by intervening torus gas can be measured to determine ionized gas densities via free - free absorption ( e.g. , ulvestad , wrobel & carilli 1999 ; ulvestad et al .",
    "1999 ) , neutral gas columns via @xmath021-cm neutral hydrogen ( ) absorption ( e.g. , mundell et al .",
    "1995 ; gallimore et al . 1999 ; peck & taylor 2002 ) and molecular gas content via oh absorption ( e.g. , hagiwara et al . 2000 ) . due to the small size scales of the radio jet and the obscuring torus ,",
    "high angular resolution imaging using the vlba is required to spatially resolve gas in the absorbing region .    in this context ,",
    "ngc  4151 , with its large quantities of neutral gas and elongated radio continuum structure , is an ideal candidate for such a study ( see ulrich 2000 for a comprehensive review of the properties of the galaxy and its agn ) .",
    "ngc  4151 is a seyfert type 1.5 ( e.g. , osterbrock & koski 1976 ) in an almost face - on ( @xmath12=21 ) , grand - design , weakly - barred spiral host galaxy , hubble type ( r)sab(rs)ab ( de vaucouleurs et al . 1991 ) , that contains significant amounts of  throughout its two optically - faint spiral arms , fat weak bar and nuclear region ( davies 1973 ; bosma , ekers & lequeux 1977 ; pedlar et al .",

    "an east - west column density gradient was observed and , in combination with uv column densities and early vlbi images , which showed c4 to consist of two components ( c4e and c4w ) separated by @xmath27  pc , led mundell et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to suggest that the weaker , western component , c4w , contains the optical / uv nucleus and thus the  absorption is taking place against the first component of the counterjet ( c4e ) , due to gas in the obscuring torus . structural and spectral index information obtained from subsequent radio continuum vlba observations of the jet at 1.6 and 5  ghz led ulvestad et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to suggest a similar model but with the agn located instead at the emission peak of c4e ( component e after ulvestad et al . 1998 ) ; requiring an absence of  absorption against the agn , this model predicted  absorption only against the start of the counterjet , i.e. the tail of emission extending eastwards of the peak in c4e ( component f after ulvestad et al . 1998 ) .    in this paper we re - open the discussion on the possible location of the agn based on new spectral line observations , but whatever the precise location of agn , ngc  4151 appears to be unusual in having neutral gas located close to the nucleus , unlike other seyferts that show  absorption associated with gas located in dust disks on scales of 100@xmath14200  pc aligned with the host galaxy disk ( e.g. , cole et al . 1998 ; gallimore et al .",
    "1999 ) ; in this respect ngc  4151 seems more similar to compact symmetric objects ( cso ) and steep spectrum core ( ssc ) objects ( e.g. , conway 1996 ; peck 1999 ; peck & taylor 2001 ) .",
    "we present sensitive new , high resolution @xmath021-cm continuum imaging , using the vlba and phased vla , of the entire 35 radio jet in ngc  4151 at an angular resolution of 40  mas ( 2.6 pc ) , along with higher resolution images of individual components with angular resolutions down to 5  mas ( 0.3 pc ) .",
    "in addition we present analysis of the first spatially - resolved images of the associated absorbing gas with an angular resolution of 10.5 mas ( 0.7 pc ) and confirm that the neutral gas , although clumpy , is located across the whole of component c4w ( e+f after ulvestad et al . 1998 ) .",
    "section [ observations ] details the observational parameters and data reduction performed ; in section [ results ] we present the results of both the sensitive , high resolution continuum imaging of the jet and the  distribution and kinematics . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we present the arguments for the location of the agn being associated with component d and discuss the relationship between the radio jet and the narrow line region .",
    "we discuss the  absorption in comparison with ly@xmath15 absorption measurements and present our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .    as discussed in mundell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) the heliocentric radial velocity of ngc  4151 is @xmath21000 km s@xmath3 , but distance estimates vary depending on the assumed value of h@xmath16 and whether the virgocentric correction and the relative velocity of the local group with respect to the virgo cluster are taken into account .",
    "distance estimates lie in the range 10@xmath7d@xmath730.5  mpc for 50@xmath7h@xmath16@xmath7100  km s@xmath3kpc@xmath3 and 1000@xmath7v@xmath71523 km s@xmath3 , but since the uncertainty in the value of h@xmath16 is as large as the virgocentric correction , for the purposes of this paper we assume a distance to ngc  4151 of 13.3  mpc , using h@xmath16=75 km s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 and the heliocentric velocity of 998 km s@xmath3 , giving a linear scale of 0.065  pc  mas@xmath3 in the galaxy .",
    "the observations were obtained with the 10 element very long baseline array ( vlba - napier et al . , 1994 ) plus the 27 antennas of the very large array ( vla - thompson et al .",
    "1980 ) used in phased - array mode at 1.4 ghz , during a 14-hour observing run on 19 march 1996 .",
    "phased - array mode involves the analog sums of the sampled and delayed intermediate frequency ( if ) signals from the vla antennas along each arm ; the combination of the amplified and filtered signals from the three vla arms is then recorded by the vlbi data acqusition system in vlba format . when used in phased - array mode to augment the vlba",
    ", the vla offers the equivalent sensitivity of a single 115-m antenna and an improvement in image sensitivity by a factor of @xmath22.4 compared with the vlba alone .",
    "although dual circular polarizations ( right and left ) were recorded , only the parallel hands ( rr and ll ) were correlated . the correlated data , using two bit sampling , consisted of two intermediate frequencies ( if ) each with an 8 mhz bandwidth , 2 polarizations and 512 channels , resulting in a maximum spectral resolution of 15.6 khz ( 3.3 km s@xmath3 ) per channel .",
    "the first if was centered near the redshifted line of ngc  4151 at 1415.19 mhz corresponding to the recession velocity 1100 km s@xmath3 ( radio convention with respect to the local standard of rest ) while the second if was shifted by 8 mhz relative to the center of if1 ( center at 1423.19 mhz ) to provide a sensitive measure of continuum emission .",
    "the simultaneous vla data , obtained with the array in c - configuration , were observed with a 25 mhz bandwidth centered at 1419.19 mhz encompassing the total 16-mhz vlba bandwidth .",
    "data editing and calibration followed standard methods and used the nrao astronomical image processing software ( van moorsel , kemball & greisen 1996 ) .",
    "vlba amplitude scales were determined from standard vlba antenna gain tables , maintained by nrao staff , and measurements of @xmath17 made throughout the run ; the integrated total flux density of ngc  4151 , as measured by the vla , was determined in the standard way from observations of 3c286 .",
    "observations of j1310 + 32 ( vlba antennas ) were used to provide a check for relative amplitude differences between antennas and ifs , while j1642 + 39 provided manual pulse and bandpass calibrations .",
    "full phase referencing was not performed thus allowing the maximum possible observing time to be spent on ngc  4151 , which is bright enough for self - calibration .",
    "however short , regular observations of j1209 + 41 were interleaved through ngc  4151 scans with a cycle time of ( 11 + 2 ) minutes to provide a check on the delay - rate corrections ; after imaging and phase / amplitude self - calibration , the amplitude - only corrections from j1209 + 41 were applied to ngc  4151 .",
    "a single - channel pseudo - continuum dataset for ngc  4151 , which was produced by averaging together the central 75% of both ifs , was then imaged and used as the input starting model for subsequent cycles of self - calibration and data editing ( e.g. walker 1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath18 range covered by the data is large , 70 k@xmath0 @xmath14 40.8 m@xmath0 at @xmath021 cm , so the data are sensitive to a wide range of spatial frequencies . using a combination of different data weightings and @xmath18 tapers ,",
    "it is therefore possible to produce a variety of images at different angular resolutions in order to show fully the complex structures present in the jet ( figures [ lowresjet ] , [ hiresjet ] , [ jetcompc ] ) .",
    "continuum images were formed with angular resolutions from 40  mas ( 2.6 pc ) to 5  mas ( 0.33 pc ) and are discussed more fully in section [ results ] . due to the lack of full phase referencing , absolute positions from j1209 + 41 were not transferred to ngc  4151 and the r.a . and",
    "dec axes are therefore provided by the pointing centre assumed correlation position , derived from earlier merlin observations ; however , measured positions for e and d that are very close to those derived from the fully phase - referenced continuum images of ulvestad et al .",

    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the additional data editing and corrections derived from the self - calibration of the continuum emission of ngc  4151 were finally applied to the ngc  4151 spectral line data and all subsequent processing concentrated on if1 .",
    "the continuum contribution in if1 ( formed from the line - free channels 32 - 182 and 350 - 450 ) was subtracted in the @xmath18 plane using aips task uvlin and the corresponding ` pure continuum ' dataset was formed from the same line - free channels in the @xmath18 plane using avspc .",
    "concentrating on the region of the source where absorption is expected ( i.e. , components d , e , f ) , the pure continuum and line datasets extracted from if 1 were then fourier transformed with uniform and natural weighting ( with 1-mas pixels ) , deconvolved and added together to form the corresponding absorption cube ( 256  @xmath4  256  @xmath4  512 ) with the correct continuum level adjacent to the line .",
    "it should be noted that although a combination of data from if1 and if2 were used to produce maximum - sensitivity continuum images of the whole jet , this continuum image is not suitable for addition to the spectral line dataset ( from if1 ) to form optical depth maps because small errors in the bandpass calibration ( @xmath75% ) between the two ifs produce significant errors in optical depth spectra ( faison et al . 1998 ) ; therefore only continuum emission from line - free channels in if1 were used to produce the optical depth maps .",
    "a full spectral - resolution cube ( spectral resolution 3.3 km s@xmath3 ) with 512 channels was produced , whilst spectral averaging was used to increase the channel sensitivity in spectral line cubes imaged with 128 and 256 channels .",
    "the intermediate spectral - resolution natural cube with 256 channels ( 6.6 km s@xmath3  per channel ) was used as a consistency check to confirm the presence of multiple narrow components detected in the 128- and 512-channel cubes ( figure [ fivespec ] ) . the more sensitive 128-channel cube ( spectral resolution 13.2 km s@xmath3 )",

    "spectra extracted from a higher angular resolution , uniformly - weighted cube indicates clumping of the gas on scales @xmath26  mas , but the signal - to - noise of the spectral was insufficient for reliable moment analysis .",
    "as discussed in section [ observations ] , the @xmath021-cm ( 1.4-ghz ) vlba+vla data are sensitive to a wide range of spatial scales , allowing a variety of images at different angular resolutions to be produced , fully probing the structures in the jet .",

    "however , as discussed previously , it is now known that c4 consists of a number of subcomponents and the precise association of the agn with one of these subcomponents is still a matter of debate . in this study",
    ", we use the characteristics of the radio continuum structure and the absorption to argue for the agn located in component d.      components c and ( e+f ) share some structural similarities having a ` banana'-like ridge on their northern half , but with the tail of ( e+f ) pointing eastwards ( i.e. counterjet ) and that of c pointing westwards ( forward jet ) ; if these opposed arc - like structures are due to interactions of the radio jet with dense clouds in the circumnuclear environment , making each component an impact site , their similar shapes and opposing directions suggest that the agn lies somewhere between the two . the greater flux density of e+f suggests that the agn is located closer e+f than to c , or that c is an older component . in addition , as described in section [ results ] , the continuum structure of component d shows a high degree of collimation ; indeed the structure resembles radio core - jet structures seen in higher power agn such as radio loud quasars .",
    "if the agn corresponds to one of the components in d ( possibly d3 ) , as originally suggested by mundell et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , this would explain the very linear , core - jet - like , structure of d and the greater brightness of e+f relative to c.    assuming that d delineates the well - collimated jet before it has suffered any interference , a jet diameter of approximately 1.4 pc is inferred .",
    "a small dense gas cloud that wanders into the path of the radio plasma flow would disrupt or deviate the jet flow .",
    "the amount of disruption depends on the impact parameter of the jet with the cloud , assuming the cloud diameter is less than that of the jet ( @xmath71.4 pc ) .",
    "component e+f can then be understood as a grazing encounter with a small dense cloud , so the ( counter-)jet is deflected at e but continues to flow over the cloud to f and outwards through g , and retaining some degree of collimation through to i.    to the west of d , the similar but more diffuse , but clearly shell - like structure of component c ( figure [ hiresjet ] ) can be explained by the jet flow to the south - west of the agn impacting a cloud more directly and so being more disrupted .",
    "with a cloud diameter smaller than the jet diameter , the jet flow is not terminated at c but continues to flow around the cloud and onwards to components b and a , but with significantly more disruption and poorer collimation than its counterpart to the north - east .",
    "indeed , the flattening of the northern half of the shell structure of c might be explained by the containment effect of a dense bounding cloud to the north of c. as shown by hst studies of ionized gas clouds in the nlr of ngc  4151 ( e.g. , wing et al .",
    "1997 ; hutchings et al . 1998 ; kaiser et al . 2000 ) , a large number of gas clouds exist in the inner regions of the galaxy , so the chance of the radio jet intercepting and being affected by gas clouds is high .",
    "in addition , the relatively flat radio spectrum of component e might be explained by re - acceleration of synchrotron - emitting electrons in the shock produced by the interaction with the cloud , rather than the agn - interpretation suggested by ulvestad et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "mundell et al . ( 1995 ) originally suggested that the discrepancy between the high column densities and systemic gas velocity inferred from merlin radio  absorption measurements ( peak @xmath26.0  @xmath410@xmath31  at @xmath2998 km s@xmath3  for  @xmath10=100 k ) and much lower columns inferred from uv observations of ly@xmath15 absorption ( kriss et al .",

    "the lower column densities of blueshifted gas seen in the uv are interpreted as outflowing ionised gas seen along the line of sight to the agn ; the higher column densities and lower gas velocity seen in the radio are interpreted as absorption through gas in the obscuring torus along the line of sight towards the first component of the counterjet .",
    "component c4w ( or d ) was then assigned as the true optical / uv nucleus with c4e ( e+f ) representing the first radio component in the counterjet against which the  absorption was occurring ( mundell et al . 1995 ) .",

    "( 1998 ) used the vlba to image , at high angular resolution , the bright components ( c , d , e , f ) at @xmath018 cm and @xmath06 cm and set upper limits for the emission at @xmath02 cm .",
    "they revised the model of mundell et al . by suggesting an alternative location for the agn in e ( as discussed above ) and predicted that  absorption would only be detected against subcomponents of f ( f3@xmath14f5 in ulvestad et al .",
    "1998 ) , with subcomponents e@xmath14f2 lying behind fully ionized gas and therefore resulting in no  absorption against these components .",
    "this prediction is easily testable with the present data and found to be inconstent ;  absorption is detected across the whole extent of e+f ( see section [ results ] and figures [ jetcompc ] , [ fivespec ] ) , ruling e out as the location for the agn .",
    "considering both the  absorption results and the radio continuum structures ( as discussed above ) , component d remains the most likely location for the agn .",
    "assuming an ionized / neutral / molecular ` onion - skin ' model for the torus , component d would then lie behind the ionized inner skin of the torus with e+f lying behind the neutral ( dissociated ) gas layer and molecular gas would be further out .",
    "the geometry of such a model is illustrated in figure [ montage ] . in this model",
    ", the weak diffuse component x , which is resolved out at higher resolutions and radio frequencies , has been placed at the centre of the torus since it also lies along the collimation axis defined by d and so could be an alternative location for the agn ; the jet can be shifted relative to the h@xmath33 image ( relative astronometry is poor ) to place whichever radio component contains the agn at the torus centre , with the condition that component e+f must lie behind the neutral gas layer .",
    "if subcomponent d3 contains the agn and ionized gas fills the inner region of the torus between d3 and the neutral gas layer starting at e , the radius ( r@xmath34 ) of the ionized gas sphere interior to the neutral layer would be approximately r@xmath34  @xmath23.3(sin@xmath3@xmath35 )  pc ( where @xmath35 is the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight ) .",
    "for an ionizing flux of 1.5@xmath410@xmath36 photons per second ( kriss et al .",
    "1995 ; ulvestad et al . 1998 ) , the electron density in strmgren radius r@xmath34  @xmath23.3(sin@xmath3@xmath35 )  pc is n@xmath37@xmath23.8@xmath410@xmath38  ( sin@xmath39@xmath35 )  @xmath40  @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the filling factor ) ; this electron density is intermediate between the densities expected for seyfert narrow - line regions ( @xmath210@xmath43  @xmath41 ) and broad - line regions ( @xmath210@xmath44  @xmath41 ) and similar to values inferred from free - free absorption in mrk  231 and mrk  348 ( ulvestad et al . 1999 ) and thermal bremsstrahlung emission upper limits in ngc  4388 ( mundell et al . 2000 ) .",
    "sensitive radio imaging over a range of wavelengths to derive radio spectra of the subcomponents in d would help to identify a flat - spectrum , high brightness temperature component indicative of an agn and characterise the quantity of ionized , free - free absorbing foreground gas .",
    "alternatively , the nucleus itself may not be visible at centimetric radio wavelengths if significant quantities of ionized gas lie along our line of sight and free - free absorb radio photons ( e.g. the absence of @xmath021-cm continuum emission between components x and c can be seen in figure [ lowresjet ] and is described in section [ results ] ) ; sensitive , high frequency radio observations , radio proper motion studies and improved hst and vlba relative astrometry will be important in determining the true location of the agn .",
    "ionized gas in the narrow line region of ngc  4151 is distributed in a clumpy , biconical structure , extending over @xmath22  north - east and south - west of the bright nucleus , and has been modelled as gas outflowing at a constant velocity of @xmath2350 km s@xmath3  along the surface of a bicone with total opening angle of 80 , viewed at 10  outside the cones ( hutchings et al .",

    "a key question in the study of the energetics and kinematics of gas in nlr regions of seyferts is the importance of the radio jet .",
    "competing models to explain optical line emission from the nlr advocate two main excitation mechanisms ; direct photoionisation by the central continuum source ( e.g. , binette et al . , 1996 ) or shock ionisation caused by the passage of the radio jet through the ism ( e.g. , dopita & sutherland , 1995 , 1996 ; bicknell et al . ,",
    "wedge - shaped morphologies observed in some nlr s ( e.g. , evans et al . , 1991 ; wilson et al . , 1993 ; wilson & tsvetanov , 1994 ; simpson et al . , 1997 ) are consistent with photoionisation by a cone of uv radiation from the central engine .",
    "alternatively , the correlation between radio power and [ oiii ] luminosity and line - width ( de bruyn & wilson 1978 ; wilson & willis 1980 ; whittle , 1985 , 1992 ) , and the approximate spatial coincidence between radio and optical structures in other nlrs suggest that the radio jets may be responsible for some of the optical line emission .",
    "radio observations of powerful quasars and radio galaxies have shown evidence for bulk relativistic ( non - thermal ) flows in the radio jets ( e.g. pohl et al .",
    "1995 ; hough , zensus & porcas 1996 ) , but it remains controversial whether ejected radio plasma in seyfert galaxies has bulk relativistic motion ( e.g. ulvestad et al . 1999",
    "; brunthaler et al . 2000 ) .",
    "bicknell et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that seyfert jets may be mildly relativistic close to the black hole and become increasingly dominated by thermal plasma on larger scales , as they entrain material from the ism .",
    "they argue that the energetic importance of seyfert radio jets has been underestimated and that jets may provide the energy input to drive the optical emission in the nlr , with jet energy fluxes ( based on a study of ngc  1068 ) being greater than previously supposed .",
    "nevertheless , a direct causal relationship between the radio jet and nlr emission has not yet been established and the relative contributions of direct photoionisation of emission line regions by the central continuum source , and strong interaction of the emission - line gas with radio plasma remains controversial .",
    "until now , the relatively small angular extent ( @xmath2 few arcsecs ) of seyfert radio jets has limited the detail visible in vla and merlin images and , radio images at even @xmath201 angular resolution , have proven insufficient to identify a clear association between nlr clouds and radio jet components ( e.g. mundell et al . 1995 ; kaiser et al 2000 ) .",
    "now however , the improved sensitivity of new radio vlbi studies is revolutionising the study of seyfert radio jets .",
    "figure [ focjet ] shows our 40-mas resolution image of the radio jet in ngc  4151 ( from figure [ lowresjet ] ) overlaid on the f501n narrow - band image taken with the faint object camera ( foc ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ( image courtesy of r. catchpole ; see also wing et al .",
    "the foc image with 00143 pixels has been resampled to match the 00175 pixel size of this radio image and , since relative astrometry between the hst and vlba images is insufficient for accurate ` blind ' alignment , the peak of the optical nuclear emission ( assumed originate from the agn ) was aligned with the peak of radio emission in component d , assumed to contain the agn .",
    "a reliable comparison of the projected location of the optical line - emitting clouds and radio jet features is now possible , although any physical association along the line of sight is still unknown .",
    "the misalignment of the radio jet and nlr supports photoionization of the nlr by the agn as the dominant excitation mechanism .",
    "a similar misalignment is present between soft x - ray emission imaged with chandra ( yang , wilson & ferruit 2001 ) and the radio jet .",
    "however , a small number of bright [ oiii]-emitting clouds appear to be closely associated with the jet , lying close to and appearing to bound the radio jet emission ; these clouds are labelled 6 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 20 in figure [ focjet ] .",
    "kaiser et al . ( 2000 ) classify all of these clouds as low velocity ( @xmath45  @xmath7  400  km s@xmath3 ) but high velocity dispersion ( @xmath46  130  km s@xmath3 ) and suggest that they may be intrinsically high - velocity clouds with smaller projected components of velocity along the line of sight .",
    "in addition , kaiser et al .",
    "( 2000 ) note that clouds 15 , 19 and 20 also have high velocity , blueshifted clouds ( @xmath45  @xmath47  1000  km s@xmath3 ) associated with them that are too faint to be visible in their labelled wfpc2 images .",
    "it is therefore likely that the radio jet might have cleared a channel through the nlr and suffered disturbance as a consequence ; remaining nlr clouds then act to gently deviate the plasma flow . alternatively , as modelled by steffen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the enhanced optical emission from the clouds bounding the radio jet might arise due to compression by a cocoon around the radio jet ; a structure of cylindrical nested shells are produced around the radio jet due to pressure stratification in the jet bow shock and the brightest compressed clouds then surround the cloud - free channel of the radio jet ( see figure 2 in steffen et al .",
    "numerical simulations , by steffen et al .",
    ", of this jet propagating through an inhomogeneous nlr - like medium show optical linewidths as high as 500  km s@xmath3 , and large variations in the cloud radial velocities , qualitatively similar to those observed for ngc  4151 .",
    "absorption by gas along the line of sight to agn is observed at a variety of wavelengths , with x - ray and uv absorption occurring predominantly in ionized gas and radio absorption in neutral and molecular gas .",
    "the nature of the `` warm '' ( or ionized ) absorbing gas detected in x - ray spectra of the nuclei of nearby agn is still unknown .",
    "as many as 50% of nearby agn show absorption by ionized gas ( e.g. george et al . 1998 ) with many also show associated uv absorption by highly ionized species such as c iv ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ; kraemer et al .",
    "2001 ) . in ngc  4151",
    "broad , saturated ly@xmath15 absorption lines are detected in the uv ( kriss et al .",
    "1995 ; espey et al . 1998 ) and , when considered along with the properties of strong absorption lines due to other species such as nv civ si iv , indicate that the absorber does not fully cover the source of background emission ( kraemer et al .",
    "the ionized gas appears to be outflowing from the nucleus with radial velocities as high as @xmath141680 km s@xmath3  ( kraemer et al . 2001 ) and can not account for the observed x - ray absorption ( e.g. george et al .",
    "1998 ; yang et al . 2001 ) .",
    "kraemer et al . ( 2001 ) suggest a model in which the uv absorber covers the blr , with the x - ray absorber closer to the central source and obscuring a smaller x - ray emitting region .",
    "the  column densities in ngc  4151 derived from ly@xmath15 absorption ( e.g. kriss et al .",
    "1992 , 1995 ; espey et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath23  @xmath410@xmath48@xmath7(ly@xmath15 )  @xmath76@xmath410@xmath9  , are significantly lower than those derived from the present @xmath021-cm observations ( see section [ results ] ) , and although the uv continuum is known to be highly variable , the uv - measured column densities remain lower than the radio values .",
    "this confirms that the neutral gas obscuring the radio continuum emission is distinct from the uv - absorbing gas and we re - propose our geometrical model ( figure [ montage ] ) in which the @xmath021-cm absorbing gas is located in a neutral , photo - dissociated layer of the obscuring torus , detected in front of the first radio component in the radio counterjet ( e+f ) , while the uv - absorbing gas is outflowing , ionized gas ( possibly blown from the torus walls ) along the line of sight to the nucleus .",
    "the total absorption spectrum across e+f is consistent with that detected in the merlin study ( mundell et al .",
    "1995 ) , but the presence of additional narrow absorption lines with higher velocities ( figure [ fivespec ] , table [ velcomps ] ) across e+f argues for dense clumps of gas within the circumnuclear disk or torus , and may indicate turbulence within the gas .",
    "clumpiness of torus gas is predicted theoretically ( e.g. krolik & begelman 1988 ) , with cloud covering factors close to or greater than unity , and recent x - ray determinations of column density variations of 20%@xmath1480% over timescales of months to years ( e.g. risalti , elvis & nicastro 2002 ) in seyfert 2 nuclei support clumping of torus material on scales less than 1 pc .",
    "clouds drifting across the background continuum source would then explain observed column density variations .",
    "sub - parsec scale radio monitoring of the  absorption across component e in ngc  4151 is required to determine if the neutral gas columns vary , and might therefore be associated with drifting cloud cores , or remain constant , suggesting  it is the primary torus volume filler in which denser clouds are embedded .",
    "a similar scenario to that suggested for ngc  4151 has been proposed for  absorption detected in the nuclear regions of the compact symmetric object 1946 + 708 ( peck , taylor & conway 1999 ) , in which complex  absorption is detected against the counterjet ( see also taylor 1996 ; taylor et al 1999 ) . indeed the higher rate of detection of  absorption in agn with two - sided , non - boosted radio jets such as compact symmetric objects ( cso ) and compact steep spectrum objects ( css ) compared with core - dominated radio sources , with doppler - dimmed counterjets , provides support for the unification scheme in which objects seem close to the plane of the sky have a more favourable geometry and orientation for the detection of hi absorption against the counterjet due to gas in a nuclear obscuring torus ( e.g. van gorkom et al .",
    "1989 ; pihlstrm 2001 ) .",
    "ngc  4151 is an unusual seyfert in having neutral gas located close to the nucleus , unlike other seyferts that show  absorption associated with gas located in dust disks on scales of 100@xmath14200  pc aligned with the host galaxy disk ( e.g. , cole et al .",
    "1998 ; gallimore et al .",
    "1999 ) ; in this respect , the  absorption , and indeed the well - collimated radio jet in ngc  4151 , closely resemble parsec - scale structures in cso and css .",
    "we have used the vlba and phased vla at @xmath021 cm to study the parsec - scale radio continuum emission and distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen in absorption in the seyfert galaxy ngc  4151 .",
    "we find :    * a faint , highly collimated radio jet , diameter @xmath11.4 pc , underlying brighter radio knots , seen in lower resolution merlin and vla images , that appear to be shock - like features associated with changes in direction as the jet interacts with small gas clouds within the central @xmath2100 pc of the galaxy . *",

    "* the location of the absorbing gas close to the agn is unusual for a seyfert galaxy and we argue that the  and continuum properties of ngc  4151 are similar to those seen in compact symmetric objects and compact steep spectrum objects .",
