    "neutrino flavor mixing and oscillation , a direct consequence of non - zero neutrino masses , are well established by experimental data  @xcite .",
    "most of the experimental data to date , including the recent discovery of @xmath5 @xcite at nuclear reactors , can be described under the 3-flavor mixing framework  @xcite .    beyond the standard 3-flavor model , sterile neutrinos",
    "are postulated as a special type of ( heavy ) neutrinos that do not interact electromagnetically , weakly , or strongly , hence the name `` sterile '' . since 90 s in the last century ,",
    "there have been several neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite which seemed to detect anomalies beyond the 3-flavor mixing .",
    "quite recently , after a re - evaluation of the nuclear reactor flux prediction  @xcite , a global deficit ( 2 - 3  @xmath6 level ) is emerging in the measured flux from all short baseline reactor neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "global fits under `` 3(active)+1(sterile ) '' ( or `` 3 + 1 '' in short ) framework favor a sizable @xmath7 and a mass splitting @xmath8 ranging from 1 ev@xmath4 and above ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although somewhat non - standard , sterile neutrinos appear to be the simplest explanation of existing experimental anomalies .",
    "they are also candidates for warm or cold dark matter under many theoretical models  @xcite .",
    "numbers of experiments are underway worldwide to search for normal - to - sterile neutrino oscillations  @xcite , including several projects at nuclear reactors . in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the feasibility of carrying out a short baseline neutrino experiment using the upcoming state - of - art china advanced research reactor ( carr ) reactor  @xcite with a thermal power of @xmath9  mw@xmath10 .",
    "as will be demonstrated below , to search for ev - scale sterile neutrinos via reactor neutrinos ( a few mev in energy ) disappearance , short baseline ( @xmath11  m ) is needed to have sufficient sensitivity . due to safety regulations , it is nearly impossible to place the detector so close to commercial reactors ( @xmath3gw@xmath10 ) .",
    "in addition , the core size ( @xmath33 meter ) introduces smearing effects to the oscillation signal  @xcite . compact research reactors ( @xmath30.1  gw@xmath10 ) , on the other hand , are more advantageous in these regards ( with a cost of lower neutrino flux from the core ) .",
    "china advanced research reactor ( carr ) , constructed at the china institute of atomic energy in beijing , china , is a tank - in - pool , inverse neutron trap type , light water cooled , heavy water reflected , multi - purpose research reactor  @xcite .",
    "the reactor body is immersed in a water pool with 16  m in depth and the core is located 12  m below the pool water surface .",
    "the reactor core is about 0.8  m in height and 0.4  m in diameter .",
    "carr takes u@xmath12si@xmath13-al as the fuel meat , with a 20% enrichment of @xmath14u in weight . with a thermal power of 60  mw ,",
    "the maximum output thermal neutron flux is about @xmath15n/@xmath16/s .",
    "carr was designed as a general - purpose thermal neutron facility for material and biological researches , as well as for isotopic production / enrichment . at present",
    ", there are 9 horizontal and 21 vertical beam lines coupled to user equipments . on the ground level of the experimental hall ( where horizontal beam lines are ) ,",
    "the center of the reactor core is 120 cm above the floor .",
    "the outer diameter of the concrete shielding structure is 5.0 m. with this geometry , the closest radial location for a neutrino detector is about 7  m from the core .",
    "nuclear reactor is a very intense source of neutrinos .",
    "pure electron antineutrinos @xmath17s are produced via @xmath18-decay of fission fragments .",
    "for a 1  gw@xmath19 reactor , there are approximately @xmath20 @xmath17s emitted per second .",
    "fission nuclei are dominated by 4 isotopes , @xmath14u , @xmath21u , @xmath22pu , and @xmath23pu , while other isotopes contribute less than 0.1% .",
    "direct theoretical calculation of the neutrino flux and energy spectrum bare large uncertainties ( at the level of 10% )  @xcite , primarily due to incomplete information from nuclear databases . on the other hand , for @xmath14u , @xmath22pu , @xmath23pu , @xmath17 energy spectra have been derived from measured electron spectra at ill , with an average uncertainties less than 2% , mainly originated from the uncertainty due to the conversion from electron to neutrino spectra  @xcite . for @xmath21u ( fast neutron - induced fissions ) , only theoretical calculations exist at present  @xcite .",
    "the isotopic concentration in fuel evolves with reactor operation time , so does the fission rate of each isotope . to predict neutrino flux at a given time , commercial reactor in particular ,",
    "detailed core simulation is needed , which carries its own uncertainty . for research reactors like carr ,",
    "however , @xmath14u enrichment is much higher than that of commercial reactors , fissions of which dominate the total fission rate . for simplicity",
    ", we shall ignore burnup effects and assume a pure @xmath14u neutrino spectrum for carr in the remainder of this work . the difference in shape between a real and a pure @xmath14u",
    "will be considered as a shape uncertainty ( bin - to - bin ) .    in this work",
    ", we adopted the simple parameterization in @xcite for @xmath14u neutrino energy spectrum , @xmath24 in units of @xmath25(mev @xmath26 fission ) , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] .",

    "neutrino - target interaction cross section is low , typically of the order of @xmath32  cm@xmath4 .",
    "background suppression is a key consideration of such experiments . on the other hand , short baseline requirement and space constraint",
    "dictate that the neutrino detector has to be placed above ground without large shielding structure . to supress background",
    ", we investigated three detection techniques , all with timing coincidence signatures .",
    "the classical method for detecting reactor @xmath17 is the so - called inverse-@xmath18 decay ( ibd ) , @xmath34 liquid scintillator ( ls ) , usually with @xmath3510% hydrogen in mass ( 11% assumed in this study ) , is commonly used both as the target and detector for this reaction .",
    "the positron loses kinetic energy immediately and annihilates into two 511 kev gammas , emitting prompt scintillation lights .",
    "the neutron will undergo thermalization collisions with hydrogen , and eventually get captured , emitting gamma rays which are converted into delayed scintillation lights .",
    "the neutrino energy can be reconstructed via @xmath36  mev , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the kinetic energy of the positron and neutrino , respectively .",
    "the detected prompt energy @xmath39 , on the other hand , contains both the positron kinetic energy as well as the annihilation energy , i.e. @xmath40  mev . to enhance neutron detection efficiency and suppress background , most modern experiments adopt gadolidium - doped ls ( gdls )",
    "@xmath41 the @xmath38 mev",
    "n - gd capture gamma rays can be used as a clean neutron tag .",
    "taking into account higher order electroweak corrections , the cross section of the ibd is given in  @xcite .",
    "folding it with reaction neutrino spectrum ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : reac_flux ] ) , detected neutrino spectrum ( without oscillation ) can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of target protons , @xmath44 is the detector efficiency , and @xmath45 is the duration of the measurement . the resulting neutrino spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ibd_scint ] , where the 1.8 mev reactor threshold of the ibd is manifest in the curve .",
    "to set the scale , the average detected neutrino rate ( assuming 100% detection efficiency ) is about 7000/mw / ton / year at 7 m. the oscillated neutrino rate and spectrum will deviate from this spectrum for a given set of oscillation parameters , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_ibd_scint ] .",
    "a common background for ibd detection with ls is the fast neutron background .",
    "the recoiling protons created by a fast neutron will scintillate and mimic the prompt energy from the ibd before the neutron get captured . since carr is a surface facility , fast neutrons background induced by comic muons and from the reactor itself may pose serious challenge to the experiment .    to mitigate this ,",
    "if the target is water instead of scintillator , recoiling protons would not be able to make erenkov lights , therefore get rejected .",
    "the technology of gadolinium - doping in water was proposed in 2004  @xcite and has been under active development  @xcite , so it would be possible to maintain this clean neutron capture tag .",
    "however to use this approach in reactor neutrino experiment there are two obvious challenges :    1 .",
    "the amount of erenkov photons is much smaller compared to the scintillating photons . as a result",
    ", water detector has much worse intrinsic energy resolution compared to that of ls .",
    "we would have to increase the photocathode coverage to get a reasonable amount of photoelectrons ( pes ) .",
    "the erenkov threshold for water is about 289  kev ( positron kinetic energy )",
    ". the ( nonlinear ) reconstruction from the visible erenkov lights to true neutrino energy will be quite different from the ls case .    a realistic estimate of the erenkov light yield is needed to address the first concern .",
    "light yields for large water detectors are summarized in  @xcite with a range between 3 - 9 pe / mev .",
    "small detectors with less light attenuation and more reflections could end up with more lights . to test this",
    ", we performed a bench test using tagged cosmic ray impinging on an acrylic ball with 5 cm diameter containing pure water .",
    "the erenkov lights are viewed by four hamamatsu r7725 photomultipliers close - by . the measured pe spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : water_light ] .",
    "the minimum ionization bump ( @xmath38  mev ) is located at @xmath333 pe .",
    "if we extrapolate this result ( photocathode coverage of @xmath312% ) to an experiment with @xmath3550% coverage , a light yield of 16 pe / mev energy deposition would be attainable .",
    "the energy resolution would still be quite low compared to the ls , but it appears that a 30% resolution would be achievable at 1 mev .    12% .",
    ", width=5 ]    the second concern can only be addressed through comprehensive calibration .",
    "not only one needs a careful calibration with gamma sources , but also electron sources ( beta or conversion electrons ) or positron sources to establish the energy nonlinearity .",
    "the elaborated calibration programs developed at superk  @xcite and sno  @xcite provide invaluable guidance in this regard .",
    "room gamma background , when in accidental coincidence with random ( cosmic or reactor ) neutron capture signals , can form ibd - like background .",
    "if such background is significant compared to the ibd signals , it may become a serious issue ( although in principle such a background can be statistically subtracted ) .    to further suppress background ,",
    "we have considered heavy water ( d@xmath13o ) as a potential target . in 70 s of the last century , reines _",
    "_ pioneered @xmath47-d measurements at nuclear reactors  @xcite .",
    "reactor @xmath17s are detected via @xmath17-deuteron charge current scattering : @xmath48 with the total kinetic energy of the positron given by @xmath49    the detection signal now becomes a triple coincidence between the prompt positron signal and two delayed neutron capture signals .",
    "neutron captures on deuteron will give a single 6.25 mev gamma ray . to avoid energy leakage for this high energy gamma , one could dope the heavy water with salt ( nacl ) so that neutron capture on clorine gives a total energy of @xmath3 8.6 mev , distributed in 2 or 3 gamma rays  @xcite .",
    "the signals produced by fast neutron will be singles , the same as in a water detector .",
    "accidental backgrounds will be highly suppressed by the triple - coincidence requirement .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath17 can also scatter off from d via neutral current channel , @xmath50 , but with no coincidence signature .",
    "a tabulated charge - current @xmath17d cross section can be found in @xcite .",
    "the measured spectrum with no oscillations is now @xmath51 with a lower cross section and higher energy threshold , the total number of detected neutrino events at 7 m is about 92/year / mw / ton ( 100% detection efficiency ) , 2 orders of magnitude less than that of ibd . illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_vd ] is a comparison of a non - oscillation and oscillated spectrum .",
    "one should emphasize that the main advantage of d@xmath13o is its unique @xmath47-d charge current signature which may lead to a background - free measurement .",
    "-d charge current spectrum without ( black ) and with ( red ) oscillation .",
    "error bars are statistical only for a 1-ton target at 7 m operating for a year.,width=3 ]    for reference , number of detected neutrino events at carr using three different targets ( 1 ton@xmath261 year@xmath26100% efficiency ) at 7  m are tabulated in table  [ tab : rate ] .",

    "the fact that the normalization uncertainty does not disappear completely is a result of the interplay between the rate and shape constraints . from experimental point of view , if detectors are constructed as movable , one could consider a `` swap '' between the near and far detectors in order to further suppress systematic uncertainties .",
    "the systematic effects discussed above can all be captured in individual nuisance parameters @xmath41 if known to infinite precision , they will not lead to biases in neutrino rate or spectrum .",
    "another class of systematics introduce smearing to the oscillation signals ; one loses sensitivity no matter how accurately the smearing is known .",
    "such effects can not be easily incorporated as nuisance parameters in @xmath54 , therefore require separate evaluation . in this section ,",
    "we discuss two major smearing effects : energy resolution and baseline smearing .",
    "the gdls target is chosen in the study .      to extract the impact of energy resolution to @xmath52",
    ", we recalculated the sensitivity with perfect detector resolution ( i.e.  no energy smearing ) , and compare it to that with realistic energy resolution given in sec .",
    "[ sec : det_response ] . simply taking the quadrature difference , the contribution to @xmath52 sensitivity at @xmath2 = 1 ev@xmath4 is less than @xmath55 for both single and two - detector scenarios .",
    "the distance @xmath56 travels from its origin to ibd interaction point is smeared out due to finite - sized core and detector geometry .",
    "several control rods are distributed in the core of carr  @xcite , therefore neutrino creation points can be approximated as uniform in a 40  cm diameter and 80  cm height cylinder . in fig .",
    "[ fig : l_dis ] the baseline distribution for the near detector at 7 m is shown , assuming that the target region is a perfect cylinder with 1 m diameter and 1.5 m height .",
    "obviously such distribution will cause a smearing to the l / e oscillation signal .",
    "the contribution to @xmath52 sensitivity was evaluated through the same quadrature difference procedure above .",
    "we obtain a loss of sensitivity of less than @xmath57 in @xmath52 for both the single detector and two - detector scenarios for @xmath2 = 1 ev@xmath4 .",
    "under the framework of `` 3 + 1 '' neutrino mixing , we have conducted a study of the sensitivities to @xmath52 at short baseline ( @xmath58 15 m ) to a research reactor ( carr ) using three targets ( ls , h@xmath13o , and d@xmath13o ) .",
    "this study suggests that in the absence of background , the ls detector has the best sensitivity due to higher ibd reaction rate and more superior energy resolution . for an experiment detecting @xmath59d cc scattering using heavy water , the event rate is far less , with a powerful suppression of potential background nevertheless . from the comparison between `` rate - only '' and `` rate+shape '' analyses ,",
    "we conclude that the spectrum distortion provide crucial handle to oscillation therefore a key to the experiment design . to cancel uncertainties from the reactor flux prediction",
    ", we compared the performance of a single - detector and two - detector design .",
    "the latter leads to not only a better sensitivity but also a suppression of systematic uncertainty . under the current best scenario ( liquid scintillator , two - detector , no background , and `` rate+shape '' analysis ) , a ton - scale detector operating for a year can reach a sensitivity ( 95.5% ) of @xmath30.02 to @xmath52 for @xmath601 ev@xmath4 , severely constraining the sterile - to - regular oscillation parameter space suggested by global analysis",
