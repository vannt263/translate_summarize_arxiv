    "the problem of quantizing the general gravitational field ( gf ) ( gravitational wave ( gw ) @xcite ) have , theoretically , been tackled by different methods and persons beginning from the earlier works of rosenfeld @xcite , bergmann @xcite and schwinger @xcite to the canonical methods of dewitt @xcite , adm @xcite and dirac @xcite . among the supposed quantum characteristics of the gf ( gw )",
    "is the probability interpretation @xcite which is extended from the quantum regime so that one interprets @xcite the gf ( gw ) function as a probability amplitude @xcite .",
    "this problem of quantizing and interpreting , in probability terms , the gf entails in turn a second interesting problem of how and in which way to increase the probabilty of some specific gf . taking the cylindrical gf as an example and assuming that one starts from a hypersurface with a cylindrical geometry ane",
    "may ask how to increase its probability so that this same cylindrical geometry may persist upon this hypersurface .",
    "this problem is also found , under different terms and terminology , in other disciplines of general relativity .",
    "thus , a central issue of quantum gravity @xcite is the problem of substantially increasing the probability of some quantum foam @xcite , with a typical order of magnitude of the planck - wheeler length ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , so that it may be realized in full grown human scale with a unity probability .",
    "an example of the latter , which is intensely discussed in the literature @xcite , is that of the theoretical increase of some foam - like probability tissue in the form of wormhole to the realized human - scale ( of unity probability ) so that it may be used for spacetime and , especially , time travelling @xcite .    as known , the mentioned first problem of quantizing the gf ( gw ) finds its solution when one restricts the discussion to limited dynamical regions of geometrodynamics such as the minisuperspace and miniphasespace discussed by dewitt @xcite , misner @xcite and , especially , by kuchar @xcite which applied it for quantizing the cylindrical gw .",
    "kuchar did it by extending the extrinsic time idea , which was first introduced @xcite for the linearized theory @xcite of general relativity , to the nonlinear theory @xcite and , especially , to the cylindrical spacetime .",
    "this extrinsic time variable , which is of the tomonaga - schwinger many - fingered time kind @xcite , is canonically conjugate to momentum and not to energy as is the intrinsic time which serves more as a label to distinguish between spacelike hypersurfaces @xcite in a one - parameter family of them .",
    "thus , using the extrinsic time variable one may obtain @xcite , as known from @xcite , a formalism which is identical to that used for discussing the parametrized @xcite cylindrical massless scalar field in a flat minkowskian background .",
    "this suggests , as noted in @xcite , that all the results obtained from the later case may , theoretically , be applied also for the cylindrical gf in a curved spacetime .",
    "these applications include also the canonical quantization of the cylindrical gf ( gw ) and the derivation @xcite of a functional time - independent schroedinger - type equation for it",
    ". moreover , kuchar has succeeded @xcite to apply for the cylindrical gf ( gw ) not only quantum ideas such as the inner product of states @xcite or path independence of the evolution of them but also their probability interpretation @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use this successful quantization of the cylindrical gw as a basis for discussing the mentioned second problem of finding the conditions under which the mentioned probability increases and even approaches unity . in the quantum regime , where states change with both time and space @xcite , there exists the known zeno effect @xcite which causes these changing states to become constant and fixed and , therefore , to cause their probability , as in classical physics , to become unity .",
    "this effect , which were experimentally validated @xcite , has three different versions : + ( 1 ) repeating a large number of times , in a finite total time , the same experiment of checking the present state of some quantum system that has been prepared in an initial specific state so that in the limit of a very large number of repetitions in the same total time the initial state is preserved in time @xcite . + ( 2 ) performing a large set of different experiments each reducing the system to some state ( from a large number of different ones ) thereby obtaining a large number of different possible paths of states ( feynman paths @xcite ) so that in the limit of doing these experiments in a `` dense '' manner one may `` realize '' @xcite any specific path of states in the sense that the probability to proceed along all its constituent states tends to unity . +",
    "( 3 ) simultaneously performing the same experiment in a large number of non - overlapping spatial subregions all included in a finite total region so that when these subregions infinitesimally shrink , keeping the total region fixed , one avoid any spatial shifting of the state @xcite .",
    "this may be explained by the example of trying to locate a very small particle - like object in the finite total spatial region which become easier when this region is divided into several equal parts each occupying the same small object and the searching for it is done in each of these smaller regions .",
    "it is obvious that the smaller become these regions in the finite total region the probability to locate the small object in each of them grows so that in the limit in which they infinitesimaly shrink this probability tends to unity .",
    "+ the first two cases ( 1)-(2 ) are , respectively , known @xcite as the static and dynamic zeno effects while the third ( 3 ) is the the space zeno effect @xcite .",
    "we note that whereas the quantum states are related to the ordinary intrinsic time the gravitational cylindrical states are characterized by @xcite an _ extrinsic time _ variable which is related ( and actually borrows @xcite its name ) to the extrinsic curvature .",
    "that is , the gravitational state , represented by the probability that the related hypersurface has cylindrical geometry , changes in spacetime with respect to _",
    "extrinsic time_. thus , since this extrinsic time , like the ordinary spatial variable , is @xcite canonically conjugate to momentum ( which is connected to extrinsic curvature ) the corresponding gravitational zeno effect should also have spatial characteristics as in the mentioned space zeno effect .",
    "we directly show in this work , using space zeno terms @xcite , that one may avoid any space shifting of the cylindrical gf ( gw ) thereby fixing its cylindrical geometry and causing its probability to approach unity . in the following",
    "we precede this zeno demonstration with a discussion wich shows that the cylindrical gf may be represented as a large number of constituent parts in some finite region of space so that it may be discussed in spatial zeno terms @xcite .",
    "the appropriate representation which enables one to do so is the occupation number one @xcite .",
    "thus , we discuss here , in detail , this representation @xcite in relation to the cylindrical gf .",
    "we note in this respect that although this representation in the context of cylindrical gf is mentioned in the literature @xcite no explicit , as far as we know , and detailed expressions of it exists so far    as known from quantum mechanics in the occupation number representation @xcite , one may , theoretically , prepare any quantum state by merely applying the relevant creation and destruction operators @xcite any required number of times upon some initial basis state .",
    "one also knows from the canonical formalism @xcite of general relativity that it is possible to prepare the geometry of some spacetime hypersurface by controlling the form of the lapse and shift functions @xcite .",
    "that is , any specific evolution of spacetime should be preceded by determining beforehand these functions so that one can be sure ( with a unity probability ) that the related spacetime is developed along the specified route .",
    "this operation , characterized by the determination of the lapse and shift functions , should be related , when discussing the quantum properties of the gf , to the corresponding operation of the mentioned quantum creation and destruction operators upon some initial basis state .",
    "we derive here in detail the appropriate expressions which accordingly relate the cylindrical lapse and shift functions to the creation and destruction operators .",
    "when the mentioned probability of the cylindrical gw approach unity ( also in consequence of the spatial zeno effect ) the related gw produce certain effects upon the neighbouring spacetime through which it proceeds such as implanting its cylindrical geometry upon it and giving rise to some trapped surface @xcite .",
    "we follow the developement of this cylindrical gw , once its probabilistic chances were greatly increased , and find its properties in the transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge and also calculate the geometry of the generated trapped surface @xcite .    in section ii",
    "we introduce the principal expressions @xcite related to the einstein - rosen cylindrical gw @xcite as , especially , represented in @xcite . in section iii",
    "we discuss the cylindrical gf ( gw ) in the commutation number representation @xcite so that it may be thought of as composed of a very large number of gravitational quanta which , like the quantum ones @xcite , are created and destroyed by the corresponding gravitational creation and destruction operators . in section",
    "iv we relate the cylindrical lapse and shift functions @xcite which determine the geometry of spacetime hypersurfaces to the mentioned gravitational creation and destruction operators which , likewise , determine this geometry through creating or ( and ) destroying the quantum components of the generating gw .",
    "we note that the cylindrical lapse and shift functions were related in @xcite to the einstein - rosen parameters ( see eqs ( 29)-(30 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed calculation relating the cylindrical lapse and shift functions to the creation and destruction operators are shown in appendix @xmath1 . in section",
    "v we show that , beginning from a gravitational cylindrical geometry in some hypersurface , the probability to find the same geometry upon this hypersurface tends to unity in the limit of the space zeno effect @xcite . as mentioned , we rather discuss the space zeno effect and not the ( intrinsic ) time analogue of it because in the cylindrical geometry one discusses @xcite the extrinsic time variable which is canonicaly conjugate to momentum @xcite just as is any spatial variable .",
    "we note that it has been shown @xcite , using the examples of the quantum bubble and open - oyster processes @xcite , that the mentioned static and dynamic quantum zeno effects are also valid in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "we also note in this respect that the quantum zeno effect were discussed @xcite in the framework of gravitomagnetism @xcite .",
    "the detailed calculations of the appropriate probability is shown in appendix @xmath2 . in section",
    "vi we graphically corroborate our theoretical results so that one may see how the probability approach unity in the zeno limit . in section vii",
    "we discuss the cylindrical gw in the transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge which is characterized by a very simplified formalism @xcite in which , for example , the number of independent components of the related gw is minimal @xcite . in section viii",
    "we discuss , using the method in @xcite , the related trapped surface @xcite resulting from the passing cylindrical gw . in section ix",
    "we summarize our discussion in a concluding remarks section .",
    "a spacetime is considered to be cylindrically symmetric @xcite if and only if one can show that there sxists a coordinate system @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 in which the line element becomes @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are functions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the former dependence of the nonzero metric tensor components @xmath13 upon the functions @xmath14 is , especially , designed @xcite to suit the adm @xcite canonical formulation of general relativity .",
    "thus , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the known adm lapse and radial shift functions @xcite . the coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , essentially , fixed except for a possible trivial transformation of @xmath19 and @xmath20 whereas @xmath11 and @xmath12 may be subject , without changing the form of the line element from ( [ e1 ] ) , to the more general transformation @xmath21 one may show @xcite , using the killing vector formalism in the @xmath22 system , that the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are scalars .",
    "thus , since the metric tensor coefficients depends , as mentioned , only upon @xmath11 and @xmath12 one may write @xcite the @xmath25 part of the line element ( [ e1 ] ) in the following conformally flat form @xmath26 where the @xmath23 , @xmath27 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are not barred due to their mentioned essential invariancy . now ,",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , if one writes the einstein field equations for the line element ( [ e3 ] ) one may realize that @xmath23 must be a harmonic function which satisfies @xmath28 .",
    "thus , one may assume @xcite @xmath23 to be a new radial coordinate and @xmath29 the time coordinate corresponding to it .",
    "that is , as emphasized in @xcite , the einstein - rosen coordinates can be uniquely and rigorously defined by invariant prescriptions so that the line element ( [ e3 ] ) may be written as @xmath30 in such case the einstein vacuum equations are considerably simplified and reduce to the following three equations @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    as emphasized in @xcite , eq ( [ e5 ] ) has exactly the same form as the wave equation of the cylindrically symmetric massless scalar field @xmath27 advancing in a minkowskian spacetime whereas eqs ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e7 ] ) are , respectively , the energy density and the radial momentum density of this field in cylindrical coordinates . the solution of eq ( [ e5 ] ) is obtained by using the separation of variables method @xcite so that the resulting wave function for a particular wave number @xmath34 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bessel function of order zero @xcite and @xmath37 are the amplitude and its complex conjugate of the solution to the time part of eq ( [ e5 ] ) . note that here we assume , as generally done in the relevant literature , that @xmath38 so that @xmath39 where @xmath40 are respectively the frequency , wave number and momentum of some mode",
    ". since @xmath34 is a continuous parameter one may obtain the general solution to eq ( [ e5 ] ) by integrating over all the modes @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the relevant general wave function is @xmath41 the canonical conjugate momentum @xmath42 may be obtained @xcite by using the hamilton equation @xmath43 where @xmath27 is given by eq ( [ e9 ] ) , the curly brackets at the right denote the poisson brackets and the hamilton function @xmath44 is @xmath45 the quantities @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the rescaled superhamiltonian and supermomentum which where shown in @xcite ( see eqs ( 93)-(97 ) and ( 106)-(108 ) in @xcite ) to be @xmath48 where the suffixed apostroph denote differentiation with respect to @xmath12 and @xmath49 are the respective momenta canonically conjugate to @xmath29 and @xmath23 . the quantities",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively denote the rescaled lapse and shift function @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( see eq ( 96 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath42 were shown @xcite to have the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the first order bessel function @xcite which may be obtained by differentiating @xmath36 with respect to @xmath23 as @xmath54 .",
    "the initial data for @xmath55 and @xmath42 are calculated for @xmath56 and @xmath57 and are , respectively , denoted by @xmath58 and @xmath59 as follows @xmath60 @xmath61 solving the last two equations for @xmath62 and @xmath63 one obtains @xmath64 @xmath65 one may show , using eqs ( [ e16])-([e17 ] ) , that the variables @xmath66 satisfy the following poisson brackets @xmath67= \\frac{i\\delta(k - k')}{2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & &    \\{a(k),a(k')\\}=\\{a^*(k),a^*(k')\\}=0 ,       \\label{e18 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where use was made of the relation @xcite @xmath68 in a similar manner , using eqs ( [ e14])-([e15 ] ) , it is possible to show that the variables @xmath58 and @xmath59 satisfy the following poisson brackets @xmath69= -2i\\delta(r - r ' ) \\nonumber \\\\   & &   \\{q(r),q(r')\\ } = \\{p(r),p(r')\\ }   = 0 , \\label{e19 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where use was made of the relation @xcite @xmath70 using eqs ( [ e6 ] ) , ( [ e9 ] ) and the unnumbered relation written just after eq ( [ e18 ] ) one may obtain the following expression for the energy @xmath71 @xcite @xmath72 as shown in @xcite the former expression ( [ e20 ] ) is for @xmath23 at infinity and it shows that the energy remains finite for this case .",
    "we are interested in other expression for the energy in terms of @xmath58 and @xmath59 which is derived from the expression ( [ e20 ] ) by using eqs ( [ e16])-([e17 ] ) and the poisson brackets ( [ e19 ] ) @xmath73 where the @xmath34 term is obtained by using the relation ( [ e19 ] ) and the unnumbered relation just after it .",

    "one may obtain from the two ends of the second commutation relation ( [ e24 ] ) @xmath97 solving the last equation for @xmath98 and substituting in ( [ e25 ] ) one obtains for @xmath99 @xmath100 now , multiplying eq ( [ e25 ] ) by @xmath101 and adding to ( [ e26 ] ) one obtains @xmath102 from the last equation one may realize that @xmath103 is different from zero only when @xmath104 . that is , operating with the operator @xmath105 on the ket @xmath95 results in some multiple of the ket @xmath96 with an energy lower by @xmath34 than that of the ket @xmath95 . if , on the other hand , eq ( [ e25 ] ) is multiplied by @xmath106 and then added to ( [ e26 ] ) one comes with the result that operating with the hermitian adjoint operator @xmath107 on the ket @xmath95 results in some multiple of the ket @xmath96 with an energy higher by @xmath34 than that of the ket @xmath95 .",
    "note that for the harmonic oscillator these two operators change roles so that @xmath105 is the energy raising operator whereas @xmath107 is the energy lowering one ( see section 25 in @xcite ) .",
    "now , since the energy must be positive one can not apply indefinitely the lowering operator @xmath105 on any ket unless there exists a lowest energy eigenstate @xmath108 so that @xmath109 ( compare with the analogous discussion in @xcite regarding the harmonic oscillator ) .",

    "application of the raising operator @xmath107 on an arbitrary ket results in raising its energy by @xmath34 and repeated application of it generates a sequence of eigenstates that may appropriately be denoted by @xmath116 .",

    "it may be shown , as for the corresponding harmonic oscillator case , that considering the representation in which each @xmath129 is diagonalized , the states of the quantized field may be represented by the kets @xmath130 in which each @xmath131 is a positive integer or zero and it is an eigenvalue of @xmath129 .",

    "we , thus , have shown that the quantized cylindrical gf ( gw ) may be discussed in the commutation number representation in which it may be thought of as composed of a large number of particle - like components inhabiting a certain finite spacetime region .",
    "this special representation enables us , as mentioned , to discuss the cylindrical gf ( gw ) in space zeno terminology as we do in the following sections v - vi .",
    "for finding the appropriate lapse and shift functions @xmath139 which correspond to the cylindrical gw s in the canonical formalism we begin from the hamilton equation ( [ e10 ] ) in its quantum version @xmath140 $ ] where @xmath27 is given by eq ( [ e9 ] ) and the square brackets at the right denote the quantum commutation relations .",

    "the embeddings @xmath142 are cylindrically symmetric slices in spacetime where , due to this symmetry , @xmath146 and @xmath147 do not depend on @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the time differentiation @xmath148 may be written as @xmath149 where @xcite @xmath150 .",
    "thus , using the last equation , the relation @xcite @xmath151 and the fact that @xmath27 does not depend on @xmath17 and @xmath18 one may calculate the commutation relation from eq ( [ e37 ] ) as @xmath152 since the last equation involves real and imaginary expressions we have to decompose it into two equations one of which relate the real expressions among themselves and the second the imaginary ones .",
    "thus , the equation involving the real expressions is @xmath153 and that involving the imaginary ones is @xmath154 we integrate both sides of the last two equations ( [ e40])-([e41 ] ) over @xmath12 from @xmath120 to @xmath121 and also for avoiding the intricacy of the resulting expressions and facilitating the following calculation we label these expressions as @xmath155 thus , eqs ( [ e40])-([e41 ] ) integrated over @xmath12 , may be compactly written as @xmath156 solving the last two equations for @xmath157 and @xmath158 one obtains @xmath159 the expressions @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 are calculated in appendix @xmath1 and are , respectively , given by eqs ( [ @xmath163)-([@xmath164 ) there .",

    "for demonstrating the zeno effect in the cylindrical gf ( gw ) we use the dirac quantization of the cylindrical gw in the half parametrized formalism as represented in @xcite .",

    "as known @xcite , in the canonical formulation of general relativity the lapse and shift functions , which are fixed ( by observer ) upon some space - time hypersurface , determine @xcite the later evolution and geometry of space - time .",

    "we have expressed these lapse and shift functions in terms of the creation and destruction operators .",
    "moreover , we were not contented in only finding the conditions through which the probability of the gf ( gw ) increases but also follow the `` realized '' ( with unity - value probability ) gf ( gw ) in its passage through space - time .",
    "we have , thus , discussed its properties in the ( tt ) gauge and have calculated the trapped surface generated by it .",
    "it must be noted that although the time version of the quantum zeno effect was experimentally validated @xcite no such corroboration exists , for now , for its spatial version @xcite and less for the gravitational application of it that we use here .",
