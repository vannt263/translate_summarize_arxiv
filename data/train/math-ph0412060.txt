    "we have @xmath39 and the approximate frequency results to be @xmath40 we have already named this approach lindstedt  poincar  linear  delta  expansion ( lplde ) .",

    "here we apply the lplde and the alpt to the cases @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "( [ fig1 ] ) shows the error over the frequency , defined as @xmath66 , as a function of @xmath3 ( @xmath67 ) produced by partial sums through order @xmath68 for both approaches .",
    "we observe that the lplde technique , which yields much more accurate results than the straightforward lpt , is less accurate than the alpt . a similar behavior can be observed in fig .",

    "interestingly , close to @xmath70 , which corresponds to a condition of ( unstable ) equilibrium , the lplde method performs better than the alpt .",

    "( [ fig2 ] ) and ( [ fig3 ] ) show the error over the frequency as a function of the order of approximation for quartic ( duffing ) , sextic and octic anharmonic oscillators with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the situation is different in the case of the nonconservative vdp equation because the alpt exhibits a great convergence rate , but it yields a wrong frequency for @xmath73 , which suggests a wrong dependence on this coupling parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the lplde yields reasonable results for any value of @xmath3 , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "our results suggest that the alpt method is more accurate for conservative systems but fails for nonconservative ones , while , on the other hand , the lplde yields reasonable results in both cases . at present",
