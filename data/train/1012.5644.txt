    "the dynamics of atoms in intense , ultrashort laser pulses involves the absorption and emission of many photons , making non - perturbative methods necessary . by far",
    "the most common such method is the direct numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "unfortunately , this approach does not often provide the kind of simple physical picture that lets one understand the dynamics and predict what will happen under different circumstances . moreover , numerically solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation",
    "accurately is , in most cases , a demanding task .",
    "these shortcomings have played a large role in promoting the three - step ( or simpleman s ) model  @xcite of ionization dynamics . in its normal application ,",
    "each step of the this simple model draws from a different theoretical formulation , although it can be rigorously derived with a few approximations  @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", the non - perturbative treatment of molecular dissociation in intense , ultrashort laser pulses has led to a different  but simple and useful  physical picture that guides many researchers understanding of these systems .",
    "this picture combines the floquet representation with the born - oppenheimer approximation , producing born - oppenheimer potentials that include the effects of the laser field .",
    "all of the insight earned in understanding field - free molecular dynamics can thus be directly applied to molecules in a laser field .",
    "importantly , these `` dressed potentials '' provide a description of the laser - induced dynamics using only a single theoretical formulation .",
    "these dressed potentials have also provided the interpretations behind the mechanisms of bond - softening , vibrational trapping ( bond - hardening ) , above - threshold dissociation , and zero photon dissociation .",
    "recently , the picture has even been generalized to include ionization - dissociation channels , leading to the prediction of a new mechanism  above threshold coulomb explosion  which was subsequently measured  @xcite .    a natural question to ask , then , is whether such a floquet approach can be applied to atoms in intense fields and , if so , does it yield a similarly useful physical picture  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we answer this question by generating dressed potentials for the electron s motion in a hydrogen atom exposed to an intense laser .",
    "it is the generation of dressed potentials that distinguishes our work from the substantial body of work using the floquet approach for atoms in intense fields  @xcite .",
    "our approach does , however , bear a closer resemblance to treatments of rydberg atoms  @xcite and is very similar in spirit to the recent work of miyagi and someda  @xcite .",
    "they emphasized the comparison of circular and linear polarization in the velocity and acceleration gauges .",
    "while they use the adiabatic potentials for radial motion in the acceleration gauge to interpret their numerical results , we focus on developing the length gauge adiabatic potentials into a more general framework for understanding and predicting the response of an atom to an intense laser pulse .",
    "we further test the quantitative predictive power of the potentials by calculating physical observables in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the floquet theorem has been invoked many times in the past to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation for an atom in an intense field .",
    "in fact , floquet calculations provide some of the most accurate non - perturbative ionization rates available .",
    "with one primary exception , though , no simple picture like that for molecules has emerged from this previous work .",
    "floquet ideas did , however , provide an elegant understanding for that exception : the stabilization of atoms against ionization in a high - frequency laser field  @xcite .",
    "we will thus be applying the floquet theorem in a non - standard way .    for simplicity , and to allow the focus to be on the new representation we introduce , we will consider a cw laser field .",
    "this simplification has the additional benefit of allowing easy quantitative comparison with previous calculations .",
    "our approach can be generalized to the case of a laser pulse using the ideas described in  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom in an intense laser field is given in atomic units by @xmath0 using the dipole approximation and choosing the length gauge ( see app .",

    "we define the effective hamiltonian @xmath11 as @xmath12    the primary reason that the molecular floquet approach described above is so useful is that it produces easy - to - interpret potentials that include the effects of the laser field .",
    "so , our goal is to similarly produce dressed potentials for an atom . the most natural way to do",

    "the final kinetic energy of such an electron is the difference between the initial energy and the final threshold energy , which in this case is 0.1  a.u .",
    "since the electron absorbed two photons to ionize , dipole selection rules dictate that it should end up with @xmath29=1 or 3 .",

    "we thus predict that the ionized electron will primarily have @xmath47 .",
    "physically , then , we expect the angular distribution of photoelectrons to have primarily @xmath48-wave character .    if the wavepacket ends up on the @xmath26=2 channel instead , then the electron has simply been excited since the @xmath26=2 threshold energy lies above the initial energy . to get to the @xmath26=2 threshold ,",
    "the wavepacket must emit a photon at the crossing around @xmath2=5  a.u .",
    "based on the small gap at that crossing compared to the kinetic energy at that @xmath2 , the electron will most likely traverse the crossing diabatically and thus ionize .",
    "should it emit a photon and remain bound however , arguments similar to the ionization case predict that the excitation pathway should lead mainly to @xmath29=0 rather than @xmath49 .",
    "these adiabatic potentials thus provide considerable qualitative  and quantitative  information .",
    "in fact , within this picture , we can also distinguish simultaneous absorption or emission processes from sequential processes .",
    "along the excitation pathway described above , for instance , the process is initiated by the simultaneous absorption of three photons during the tunneling , followed after some delay by the emission of one photon .",
    "`` simultaneous '' in this case means that the photons were exchanged with the field at a single avoided crossing .",
    "the three - photon absorption during tunneling really takes places over an @xmath2 range of about 1.5  a.u . as the potential has clear @xmath26=0 character only up to about @xmath2=2  a.u . , and @xmath26=3 character only after about @xmath2=3.5  a.u .",
    "the electron , of course , takes a finite time to cross this distance .",

    "should this happen , it might be observable as a reduced ionization rate . or , in a time - dependent measurement , it might be observable as ionization on different time scales as the trapped portion of the wavepacket should take longer to ionize .",

    "physically , this condition is clearly achieved if the adiabatic parameter @xmath2 is indeed the `` slowest '' variable in the system .",

    "some part of this ionizing wavepacket can find itself on the @xmath106 , @xmath107 curve after a few transitions .",
    "this potential is attractive , and this part of the the wavepacket gets reflected back towards the ion as expected . for the circular case in fig .",
    "8(b ) , however , once the electron passes over the barrier to ionize , it encounters only repulsive potentials and thus never rescatters .",
    "in this paper we have developed the adiabatic floquet picture to describe the dynamics for hydrogen atom in monochromatic laser field . although the analysis is trivially extended to any effective one - electron atom .",
    "the radial distance of the electron @xmath2 is adopted as adiabatic parameter , leading to a set of potential curves that include the effect of the laser field .",
    "the potentials are completely analogous to born - oppenheimer potentials can be interpreted in the same way . in particular ,",
    "very simple approximations such as wkb and landau - zener can be applied to make semi - quantitative predictions from these potentials that are non - perturbative in the field strength .",
    "just how fruitful this picture is remains to be seen .",
    "the diabatic curves have the distinct advantage of being very easy to generate , and already allow the application of simple approximations . while we did not explore it here ,",
    "one of the more intriguing possibilities is using these curves to estimate the times at which particular photon transitions occur .",
    "few other approaches provide this information , especially in such a simple manner .",
    "having established the reliability of our picture in this paper , we hope that such timing information can prove useful in controlling attosecond dynamics .",
    "while physical observables must be gauge invariant ( in the limit of no approximations ) , the adiabatic floquet potential curves are not .",
    "the choice of gauge is usually made for computational convenience and clarity in analysis .",
    "there are , in principle , an infinite number of choices , but in practice three main gauges are usually discussed : ( _ i _ ) the velocity gauge , which is the minimal - coupling schrdinger equation in the dipole approximation ; ( _ ii _ ) the length gauge , which was the starting point for this paper ; and ( _ iii _ ) the so - called `` acceleration gauge '' ( also known as the kramers - henneberger frame @xcite ) . as mentioned above , the velocity gauge is not attractive for an adiabatic representation because not all terms in the hamiltonian involving the field are contained in @xmath108 .",
    "the length and acceleration gauges , however , are both good candidates for an adiabatic picture since the laser field is completely included in @xmath109 ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    "we will briefly discuss the adiabatic floquet picture for atomic hydrogen in the acceleration gauge .",
    "the adiabatic hamiltonian for hydrogen in the acceleration gauge is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the classical trajectory of a free electron in an oscillating field . in the present case of a cw laser ,",
    "@xmath112 with @xmath113 , assuming @xmath114 .",
    "one advantage of the acceleration gauge is that the effect of the electric field vanishes in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "understandably , then , the usual field - free solutions are recovered , whereas in the length gauge the laser - atom interaction diverges linearly in @xmath2 .",
    "a disadvantage of the acceleration gauge is the difficulty presented by the oscillating coulomb singularity .        where @xmath26 and @xmath116 are again the floquet indices , and @xmath117 replace the spherical harmonics as the basis functions for the @xmath118 dependence . in our calculations",
    ", we took @xmath117 to be b - splines  @xcite .",
    "at that electric field strength and frequency , @xmath119 , and in the figure the complicated nature of the curves is quite clear for @xmath120 . while in the acceleration gauge",
    ", the channels decouple at large @xmath2 , they are strongly coupled at small @xmath2 .",
    "further , unlike the length gauge , the familiar dipole selection rules are no longer valid , and in fact all of field - free angular momentum states are coupled together near @xmath121 .",
    "this makes tracing a path through the potential curves very difficult , even locating the curve the system initially sits on is a challenge .",
    "the crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : accel_pot ] trace out the initial state when @xmath122 . in the underlying mess of curves",
    ", one can see the semblance of the avoided crossings mentioned in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot_curves](b ) , but the hopes of finding a path that passes though these crossings is daunting .",
    "while the thresholds are easy to determine in the acceleration gauge , the steep trade - off is in the loss of physical intuition in the region close to @xmath121 .",
