    "the idea of extra - dimensions where ordinary matter is confined within a lower dimensional submanifold has received an enormous amount of attention during the last few years ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this idea has been explored , in particular , in the cosmological context .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in the case of a single extra - dimension , a simplifying assumption has been to consider our brane - universe as infinitely thin along this extra - dimension .",
    "it has been shown that this approximation is quite valid as long as the energy scales one wishes to explore are much smaller that the energy scale related to the inverse thickness of the brane .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the purpose of the present paper is to explore the modification of the equations yielding the cosmological evolution within the brane when the finite thickness of the brane is taken into account .",
    "we consider this question in a purely phenomenological approach by assuming that the matter energy - momentum tensor describing the brane has some distribution over a finite length interval along the fifth dimension .",
    "our approach ( similar to that of @xcite ) is thus more crude , but also more general , than the domain wall description of a brane , for which the brane is embodied by a scalar field , such as in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent study in 4d gravity and @xcite for a review on domain walls , in particular in supergravity ) .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    two limiting cases are already known .",
    "the case of an infinitely thin brane gives the unconventional friedmann equation of @xcite , which can be made compatible with ordinary cosmology at late times if one introduces both a negative cosmological constant in the bulk spacetime and a related tension ( unmeasurable by cosmological observers ) in the brane @xcite .",
    "the other and opposite limit is that of an infinitely thick brane , in a sense defined below .",
    "this limit effectively corresponds to a kaluza - klein picture where matter is homogeneously distributed over the extra - dimension(s ) and , as it has been known for a long time , ordinary friedmann equations are recovered .",
    "our analysis gives access to a description of the intermediate cases .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "our effective friedmann equation is established in section  [ sec2 ] and written in terms of four - dimensional effective quantities .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to the cosmology for a brane with a tension , the cosmological effect of which is cancelled by a negative bulk cosmological constant .",
    "we consider the limits of a low brane energy ( for all brane thickness ) and of a small brane thickness ( for all brane energy ) , and we propose uniform expressions for the cosmological equations valid over the whole parameter domain covered by these two limits . in section  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we determine the higher order corrections ( in the normalized brane thickness ) to the effective cosmological equations in the simpler case of a minkowski bulk . in particular",
    ", we show that no effective four - dimensional reduction is possible in the regimes of order one normalized brane thickness .",
    "we consider a five - dimensional spacetime , which is homogeneous and isotropic along three spatial dimensions , and which contains a thick brane . for simplicity , we will restrict ourselves to the case of a mirror symmetric brane ( and thus spacetime ) along the extra - dimension .",
    "it is then always possible to find a gaussian coordinate system , starting from the hypersurface representing the `` center '' of the brane , in which the line element takes the simple diagonal form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the coordinate of the fifth dimension and @xmath2 is the brane thickness which will be assumed to be time independent .",
    "the brane is localized between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . to be compatible with the spacetime symmetries ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the matter content in the brane is necessarily of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are functions of @xmath9 and @xmath1 .",
    "the presence of a negative cosmological constant in the bulk , @xmath10 , is accounted for by an energy - momentum tensor of the form @xmath11 note that , strictly speaking , @xmath10 as defined here does not have the dimension of a cosmological constant but rather that of a five - dimensional energy density .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    the purpose of this paper is to establish effective cosmological equations for an observer living in the brane . due to the finite thickness of the brane",
    ", there is some arbitrariness in the definition of what the effective four - dimensional quantities should be .",
    "the simplest prescription one can think of consists in defining the four - dimensional effective quantity associated to a five - dimensional quantity @xmath12 as its spatial average over the brane thickness @xmath13 in this paper , we will adopt this simple prescription .",
    "the four - dimensional `` observable '' counterparts of @xmath14 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are thus @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "note that , in contrast with the usual dimensional reduction in field theory , we do not integrate over the whole ( compact ) extra - dimension but only over the extension of the brane in the extra - dimension .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    the next step is now to obtain evolution equations for the four - dimensional effective quantities from the five - dimensional einstein s equations @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the ricci tensor and @xmath20 its trace .",
    "the components of the einstein equations , with the metric ( [ eq2.1 ] ) and the energy - momentum tensors ( [ eq2.2 ] ) and ( [ eq2.3 ] ) can be obtained from the components of the einstein tensor given in the appendix . in particular",
    ", the 05 component of the einstein equations yields @xmath21 where the dot stands for a partial derivative with respect to time @xmath9 and @xmath22 depends on the normalization prescription for @xmath23 . in the following , we will take the normalization @xmath24 which gives @xmath25 .",
    "the 00 component of the einstein equations then reads @xmath26 where a prime denotes a partial derivative with respect to the coordinate @xmath1 . integrating this equation over the brane ,",
    "one obtains @xmath27 where we have introduced the effective four - dimensional hubble parameter @xmath28 the anti - de sitter lengthscale associated to the ( negative ) cosmological constant in the bulk @xmath29 and the dimensionless quantities @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively defined by @xmath34 and @xmath35 whereas @xmath30 characterizes the thickness of the brane , the quantities @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 characterize the inhomogeneity of the brane along the fifth dimension ( in the case of a homogeneous brane , one has @xmath36 ) .",
    "the 55 component of the einstein equations can be written as @xmath37 with @xmath38 . imposing the boundary condition @xmath39 , one has @xmath40 which gives , after time - integration , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant of integration .",

    "it provides the generalization of the ( first ) friedmann equation relating the effective four - dimensional hubble parameter to the effective brane energy density and the brane thickness .",
    "it of course also includes some dependence on the exact profile of the energy - momentum tensor but this dependence has been conveniently reduced to the three dimensionless quantities([eq2.12 ] ) , which in typical cases are of order unity . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq2.7 ] ) and  ( [ eq2.15 ] ) , one finds that a necessary condition for the brane to be homogeneous along the fifth dimension reads @xmath44 which , in general , can not be fulfilled uniformly in time unless the energy - momentum content of the brane reduces to a mere brane tension ( as e.g. in the original static randall - sundrum model @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that , in the cosmological context , a brane with a finite thickness can not remain homogeneous along the fifth dimension .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    equation ( [ eq2.15 ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath45 which admits real solutions if the arbitrary constant @xmath42 fulfills the condition @xmath46 in the following , we will consider expression  ( [ eq2.17 ] ) with the minus sign only , which corresponds to a well defined cosmology in the @xmath47 limit .",
    "it is important to notice that this equation should be regarded as an implicit equation for @xmath48 because @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 can depend on @xmath49 .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    to conclude this section , it can be instructive to consider the two opposite limits of small and large @xmath2 . in the limit @xmath47 , equation  ( [ eq2.17 ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath50 it will be shown in the following that , in this limit , both @xmath31 and @xmath32 tend to @xmath51 . thus , one exactly recovers the unconventional friedmann equation of thin brane cosmology , where the brane energy density enters quadratically @xcite . in the opposite limit @xmath52 ,",

( [ eq2.18 ] ) yields @xmath56 as @xmath52 and one obtains @xmath57 which corresponds to the standard friedmann equation , in which the energy density enters linearly with the effective four - dimensional gravitational constant @xmath58 .",
    "note that , in this limit , both sides of the necessary condition([eq2.16 ] ) vanish , which allows the possibility of a homogeneous brane along the fifth dimension ( @xmath59 ) , in agreement with the usual kaluza - klein picture .",
    "in thin brane cosmology , the unconventional friedmann equation can be made compatible with the current cosmological observations if one assumes that the brane energy density consists of ordinary cosmological matter living in the brane and of a tension @xmath60 adjusted so as to compensate the negative cosmological constant in the bulk @xcite .",
    "this adjustment corresponds to the fine - tuning condition of randall - sundrum @xcite , which can be reexpressed as the simple relation @xmath61 where the lengthscale @xmath62 is defined from the brane tension @xmath60 as @xmath63 in this section , we will also assume that the energy - momentum content of the brane can be decomposed into two parts ,    @xmath64    where @xmath60 , which is strictly constant , corresponds to a tension of the brane .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume here that @xmath60 is independent of @xmath1 .",

    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    another important assumption was to take the brane thickness constant in time .",
    "it would be worthwhile to generalize our results when the brane thickness is allowed to evolve in time .",
    "[ [ section-14 ] ]    after emphasizing a few limits of the present work , let us now summarize the main results .",
    "a very instructive result of our work is a generalized brane friedmann equation , which interpolates between the familiar kaluza - klein picture , where the effective friedmann equations after the averaging procedure yield exactly the usual four - dimensional friedmann equations , and the initially surprising thin brane friedmann equations , where the energy density enters quadratically .",
    "we hope that our generalized friedmann equation will help in the intuitive understanding of the unconventional thin brane result , and clarify the delimitations of the various regimes where different friedmann equations have to be applied .",
    "[ [ section-15 ] ]    assuming the existence of a strict ( in both patial and temporal senses ) cosmological constant , we have also obtained a generalized version of the randall - sundrum condition of cancellation between the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension term in the friedmann equation . in our case , this cancellation condition depends explicitly on the brane thickness and yields back the familiar condition in the thin brane limit . moreover , when this cancellation condition is assumed to hold and when the cosmological matter content of the brane is assumed to be small with respect to its tension , we were able to solve for the brane profile and obtain the effective cosmological equations .",
    "[ [ section-16 ] ]    finally , we show that this is only in this case , as well as in the limit where the brane thickness is sufficiently small , that one can make sense of a four - dimensional effective cosmology . in the other cases",
    ", one can try to extend the regime of validity of the effective four - dimensional description but at the price of introducing auxiliary quantities , which is the sign that the full five - dimensional description is more adequate .",

    "<S> generalized friedmann equations governing the cosmological evolution inside a thick brane embedded in a five - dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime are derived . </S>",
    "<S> these equations are written in terms of four - dimensional effective brane quantities obtained by integrating , along the fifth dimension , over the brane thickness . in the case of a randall - sundrum type cosmology , </S>",
    "<S> different limits of these effective quantities are considered yielding cosmological equations which interpolate between the thin brane limit ( governed by unconventional brane cosmology ) , and the opposite limit of an `` infinite '' brane thickness corresponding to the familiar kaluza - klein approach . in the more restrictive case of a minkowski bulk </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that no effective four - dimensional reduction is possible in the regimes where the brane thickness is not small enough . </S>"
