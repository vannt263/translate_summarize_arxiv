    "the formulation of wave propagation by the use of huygens principle has stimulated extensive work in the past .",
    "such an approach was first pioneered by p. b. johns and coworkers who introduced the transmission line matrix modeling method ( tlm)@xcite to solve the maxwell equations in large electromagnetic structures@xcite which was later extended to the description of diffusive processes@xcite .",
    "linear wave propagation is mediated by short voltage impulses which propagate along the bonds and are scattered on each node of a cartesian mesh of transmission lines .",
    "the main idea behind such a formulation is a discrete equivalent of huygens principle , namely a principle of action - by - proximity obeyed by the pulses when they propagate at each time step from one node to the neighbor nodes and the emission of secondary wavelets at each node as described by the scattering process which radiates the incident energy in all directions . besides the appealing viewpoint of huygens principle ,",
    "the advantages of the method as a powerful tool for the numerical computation of wave propagation in complex and large structures have already been emphasized in the tlm method@xcite . a similar approach in which the pulses were just scalar quantities propagating along the bonds of a cartesian lattice , was recently advocated for studying time - dependent wave propagation in large inhomogeneous media@xcite .    here , we focus on the nature of the wave equations which result from such a formulation , especially on the possibility of retrieving standard wave equations .",
    "this question has already been raised in previous works where the scalar wave equation , the klein - gordon equation and maxwell equations have been exhibited . in the tlm method ,",
    "the equivalence between the voltage and current impulses with the electric and magnetic fields of maxwell equations was initially demonstrated on a two - dimensional mesh@xcite .",
    "the method was then extended to three dimensions and different features have been incorporated by many authors in order to describe losses , inhomogeneous media and boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "another recent formulation@xcite lead their authors to the classical wave equation , the klein - gordon equation and to the schrdinger equation .",
    "however , due to restricting assumptions , these last results were limited to scalar waves in homogeneous media , and the schrdinger equation was ill - defined at the continuum limit .",
    "this paper describes what is essentially a formulation from `` first principles '' of such an approach .",
    "the aim is to generalize the previous results to various kinds of waves in inhomogeneous media by considering the most basic properties obeyed by the scattering nodes .",
    "such a formulation not only leads to the wave equations already mentioned but also results in a time - dependent schrdinger equation which is well defined .",
    "another advantage is the possible generalization of the method from the scalar waves considered in this paper to spinor@xcite or vector waves .    at each time step ,",
    "the time - dependent discretized wave is defined as a linear combination of incident currents at each node of the cartesian lattice .",
    "the nature of the wave depends on the number of distinct propagating currents on each bond of a given node .",
    "for example , one or several kinds of currents impinging on one node by the same bond will describe a scalar , a spinor or a vector field .",
    "since they need only one type of current , scalar waves correspond to the simplest situation .",
    "for the sake of illustration , they will be the focus of this paper .",
    "in addition to the propagating currents , a current is attached to each node in order to describe an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "this current does not propagate but participates in the scattering process which involves the propagating currents .",
    "we shall demonstrate that a few elementary properties and symmetries of the scatterers like time reversal symmetry , reciprocity and isotropy lead to the classical wave , klein - gordon or schrdinger equations . at that stage ,",
    "we find that these discrete equations are not yet completely general because the mass , the velocity or the potential remain correlated .",
    "we show that it is possible to remove this limitation by attaching a second current to each node .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ cf ] ,",
    "we introduce the currents which propagate on the mesh of a cartesian lattice .",
    "scatterers are described by scattering matrices located on each node of the lattice .",
    "the field is then defined as a function of incident currents . in order for the field to obey a discretized wave equation ,",
    "the currents must be eliminated from its time evolution .",
    "we show in section  [ cl ] how this condition strongly compels the form of the scattering matrices .",
    "time - reversal symmetry , reciprocity and isotropy of the scatterers are introduced in sections  [ tr ] , [ re ] and  [ is ] respectively .",
    "the resulting discrete wave equations are discussed in section  [ we ] .",
    "this leads us to attach a second current to each node as described in section  [ tn ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ co ] by discussing possible extensions of this work .",
    "[ cf ]      [ dc ] a current is a real or complex number , which propagates along a bond of a @xmath3-dimensional cartesian lattice . for scalar waves ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider that each lattice bond carries two currents propagating in opposite directions ( figure [ fig : cartesien]).-dimensional space .",
    "however , for convenience , all figures will represent a two - dimensional cartesian lattice .",
    "] at any time @xmath4 , the system is completely defined by the values of all currents in the lattice .",
    "we assume that time and space variables are discrete . in one time step @xmath5 , a current propagates between two nodes of a given bond .",
    "all currents are synchronized .",
    "in other words , the currents are simultaneously outgoing from the nodes at some time @xmath4 and become incident currents on neighbor nodes at time @xmath6 .",
    "[ fig : cartesien ]    each node of the lattice is a scatterer .",
    "the scatterers are identical in a periodic system or are distinct , and randomly chosen in a disordered quenched system .",
    "each scatterer is described by a @xmath7 matrix @xmath8 which transforms the @xmath9 incident currents @xmath10 , at any time @xmath4 , in @xmath9 outgoing currents @xmath11 at the same time ( figure [ fig : scattering ] ) according to    @xmath12 where the @xmath13 are the matrix elements of the matrix @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : scattering ]    it turns out that the model is not sufficient to describe wave propagation in an inhomogeneous medium like a material in which the index of refraction is a function of the position .",
    "as shown later , this problem is solved by attaching to each node an additional current that will be called throughout this paper the node current . for notational convenience in sums over the currents , we shall write the node currents @xmath14 and @xmath15 . however , we emphasize that the subscript @xmath16 is not ascribed to a spatial dimension in contrast with the other indices ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath9 .",
    "the node current participates in the same scattering process as the other currents but does not propagate to neighbor nodes . instead , the outgoing current @xmath15 becomes the incident current @xmath14 on the same node at the next time step .",
    "in other words , the propagation process for the node current reads @xmath18 .",
    "we can imagine the node current as propagating in one time step along a loop attached to the node .",
    "this loop is equivalent to the `` permittivity stub '' introduced in the tlm method to describe inhomogeneous electromagnetic structures@xcite .    in conclusion , the general scheme of the time evolution of the currents",

    "this matrix is a function of the position in an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "[ df ] the previous definition of the currents includes the three essential features of the model  : the principle of action - by - proximity , which is described by the current propagation between neighbor nodes , the scattering process in which the nodes act like secondary sources of `` spherical '' wavelets and the linearity of this process .",
    "these features can be viewed as a discretized realization of huygens principle . however , additional ingredients and choices are needed to achieve the description of the model . for example",
    ", the form of the field propagation equation will strongly depend on the choice of the scattering matrices .",
    "among all the questions to be answered in our approach , the first one is how to define the field .",
    "the field is supposed to obey a discretized linear wave equation which depends on the physical problem we are interested in  : the scalar wave equation for an acoustic wave , the klein - gordon equation for a zero - spin massive particle , etc ... at time @xmath4 , the field is defined as a real or complex quantity @xmath21 on each node of the lattice , where @xmath22 , are the discrete indices which locate the node position @xmath23 , as a function of the mesh parameter @xmath24 . for briefness , we note @xmath25 the set of indices @xmath22 , of an arbitrary node .",
    "there is no reason for the field to be identified with one of the currents previously defined .",
    "actually , we just postulate that the value of the field @xmath26 is a function of the incident and outgoing currents at node @xmath25 and at time @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , by taking account of linearity , the most general definition reads    @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are complex coefficients to be determined .",
    "the field is a linear superposition of the currents , which vanishes when all currents vanish . by noticing that , due to the scattering process ( [ def : diffusion ] ) , the outgoing currents @xmath30 can be expressed as linear combinations of the incident currents @xmath31 at the same time @xmath4 , it is sufficient to define the field solely as a function of the incident currents    @xmath32    it is necessary to point out that the @xmath33 are functions of the node position .",
    "this property is required to describe an inhomogeneous system .",

    "the new closed field equation reads straightforwardly      then , the implementation of time - reversal symmetry and reciprocity can exactly be reproduced by substituting each summation over @xmath309 currents by a summation over @xmath305 currents .",
    "isotropy is also introduced in the same way by noticing again that the number of propagating currents involved in this local symmetry now depends on the node @xmath25 . as discussed in section",
    "[ is ] , the lattice being arbitrary , equation ( [ eq : mu1 ] ) holds and the sign @xmath196 can be fixed equal to @xmath17 .",
    "then , we introduce naturally the ratios @xmath310 and @xmath311 which satisfy the conditions @xmath312 and @xmath313 .",
    "finally , the equations ( [ eq : field_2node ] ) , ( [ eq : coef_trans_2node ] ) and ( [ eq : we_2node ] ) are recovered in this context and read @xmath314 ,   \\label{eq : field_2node_graph } \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\",

    "thus , equation ( [ eq : we_2node_graph ] ) is a wave propagation equation formulated for a scalar field defined on a graph .",
