    "cubic boron nitride ( cbn ) is usually produced in a high pressure - high temperature process by using mostly the hexagonal boron nitride(hbn ) as the starting material .",
    "after the first discover of the cubic boron nitride synthesis method , so far , many studies on the cubic boron nitride synthesis was progressed but the mechanism of the synthesis reaction is still under discussion .",
    "most experimental results described so far1,2,3,4,5,6,7 suffer from one clear disadvantage .",
    "since all experiments for cbn synthesis were carried out in a closed high pressure chamber , they were not observed in situ . only the final products after quench and pressure release were analyzed and only these results can be taken into account to model the transition mechanism .",
    "but the final process of pressure and temperature release may have an important influence .",
    "if the products can only be analyzed after experiment , metastable phases may occur or vanish or other phases could undergo phase transition thus leading to incorrect conclusions about the appropriate mechanism .",
    "these disadvantages are avoided if the observations are carried out under in situ conditions . in the paper 8 by using the synchrotron radiation for energy dispersive x - ray diffraction the cbn synthesis process was observed in situ . it is found that cbn grows directly from an amorphous matrix and not from different bn polymorphs as previously proposed .",
    "this is the evidence that the cbn formation process is carried out by the diffusion mechanism .    in this paper , on the basis of these experimental facts , the diffusion mechanism of cbn synthesis were theoretically studied and the cbn synthesis region in the @xmath1 phase diagram was determined .",
    "the individual atom of hbn amorphous phase moves separately to form @xmath3 bond with cbn crystal particle by diffusion , which would be overcome the energy barrier(activation energy ) .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 that are called the probability for jumping of an atom from hbn particle to cbn particle containing the @xmath6 atoms and leaving of an atom from cbn particle to hbn particle are represented as follows9    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the number and frequency of atoms in the surface of cbn particle respectively , @xmath10 is the change of the gibbs free energy by forming cbn crystal nucleus containing @xmath6 atoms .",
    "@xmath11 is boltzman constant , @xmath12 is the height of the energy barrier that would be overcame for jumping of an atom from hbn to cbn .    from now ,",
    "let us estimate the activation energy , height of energy barrier that would be overcome for an atom to break away from @xmath13 state of hbn to infinitely far dwelling site .",
    "the activation energy @xmath12 was calculated using expression ( [ eq:2 ] )    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energies of hbn perfect crystal and crystal having an vacancy occurred by the diffusion of atom , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the spinpolarized energies for the isolated boron and nitrogen atoms . for calculating the energies of the isolated boron and nitrogen atoms , bcc crystal lattice of which",
    "b atoms are placed in the apices and a n atom is placed in the middle of a cube with @xmath19 of edge length is introduced and local density approximation ( lda ) is used .",
    "the calculation of energy of crystal having an vacancy is performed by using 16 atoms and relaxation process .",
    "the precision of energy is 0.0001ev .",
    "the activation energy , calculated by using abinit application program according to the above method , is @xmath20",
    "now let us consider the kinetic theory of cbn crystal nucleus formation on the basis of the diffusion mechanism .",
    "let us denote the cbn crystal nucleus number consisting of n atoms in @xmath21 moment by @xmath22 .",
    "then the total number of cbn crystal nucleus is as following    @xmath23    the dependence of the @xmath24 on the time must satisfy the following equation @xmath25 , \\label{eq:5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the probability for jumping of an atom from hbn to cbn and leaving of an atom from cbn to hbn given by formula ( [ eq:1 ] ) respectively . if @xmath27 , equation(5 ) is approximated as following @xmath28f(n , t)\\right\\}+\\nonumber\\\\ \\ : \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial n^2}\\left\\{[p_{+}(n)+p_{-}(n)]f(n , t)\\right\\}. \\label{eq:6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is the fokker - planck equation .",
    "however , in generally since @xmath29 , can be approximated as following    @xmath30    using ( 7 ) , ( 8)and ( 9 ) , equation ( 6 ) is became as following    @xmath31+\\nonumber\\\\ \\",
    ": \\frac{1}{kt}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n}\\left[p(n)f(n , t)\\frac{\\partial\\delta g}{\\partial n}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq:10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case @xmath32 , since    @xmath33    consequently , equation(10 ) is became as follows    @xmath34+\\nonumber\\\\ \\ : \\frac{1}{kt}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n}\\left[p(n)f(n , t)\\frac{\\partial \\delta g}{\\partial n}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq:12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for quantitatively discussing on the kinetic theory of the cbn crystal nucleus formation , we must solve equation(12 ) under a given initial and boundary conditions .",
    "since the crystal nucleus does not exist in initial time , we can have the initial condition as following @xmath35 . in the moment of the crystal nucleus formation with radius of @xmath36 ,",
    "the gibbs free energy change is as following    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the chemical potential of the cbn and hbn while @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the surface free energy density of cbn and hbn .",
    "@xmath42 is the atomic number density of the cbn crystal .",
    "since the crystal nucleus with small size must generate with big probability at a condition @xmath43 by the thermodynamic fluctuation theory , we can take the boundary condition as follows    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the distribution function of the equilibrium state and is as follows    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the gibbs free energy change given by formula(13 ) .",
    "then the distribution function @xmath45 increase infinitely in out a critical size but the distribution function @xmath48 finite so that at case of the condition @xmath49 we can take the boundary condition as following    @xmath50    let us solve equation ( 12 ) on cbn crystal nucleus of the critical size neighborhood under these initial and boundary conditions . in the case that we consider a problem in the critical size neighborhood of cbn crystal nucleus",
    ", we can expand @xmath10 in the neighborhood of critical size @xmath51 by taylor series and restrict to a second term . since most of the non - steady state are near to the stationary state , generally , for the rough estimate of the non - steady time we can exchange approximately as following    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the distribution function of the stationary state that reach through the non - steady process .",
    "this stationary state distribution function is given by solving the stationary state fokker - planck equation as following    @xmath54    if we transform the equation ( 12 ) in consideration of the above facts then the equation ( 12 ) is transformed to following simple form    @xmath55    solving the equation ( 20 ) under initial and boundary conditions , we can obtain the following distribution function of cbn crystal nucleus with critical radius    @xmath56    where @xmath53 is the stationary state distribution function and @xmath57 is as following    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is radius of the volume space occupied by an atom , @xmath60 is the atomic volume difference between hbn and cbn , @xmath61 are constants determining the phase equilibrium line between cbn and hbn and @xmath9 is the oscillation frequency of an atom in the cbn crystal surface , @xmath11 is boltzmann constant , @xmath62 is the pressure,@xmath63 is the temperature , @xmath12 is activation energy , @xmath64 is the surface energy density between cbn crystal nucleus and hbn phase and it can place @xmath65 .",
    "as shown from formula ( 21 ) , since the cbn crystal nucleus distribution function is arrived to the stationary state after @xmath57 time,@xmath57 is called non - steady time and we can call this time as crystal nucleus formation time .",
    "representing the formula ( 22 ) in terms of the pressure , the following formula is obtained .",
    "@xmath66        using the formula ( [ eq:23 ] ) , we can find the cbn formation region in the @xmath1 diagram.as known from formula ( 23 ) , the @xmath1 region in which cbn crystal nucleus is formed is determined by the activation energy and nucleus formation time . for the activation energy we have used expression ( 2 ) .",
    "and the other material constants were equal as following 10 .",
    "@xmath67 .",
    "now we can obtain the boundary line of cbn nucleus formation region in @xmath1 diagram by using formula ( 22 ) according to change of the crystal nucleus formation time @xmath57 .",
    "however , if @xmath57 is 300ms , theoretical line(curve 1 of figure 1 ) coincides with experimental line ( curve 2 of figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore we can estimate cbn crystal nucleus formation time as less than 300ms .",
    "in this paper the activation energy for the transformation from hbn to cbn was theoretically found from microscopic viewpoint and estimated to @xmath68 .",
    "we have introduced an analytical formula representing the dependence of cbn nucleus formation time on the activation energy , synthesis pressure and temperature . using this formula , the boundary line of cbn nucleus formation region in the @xmath1 phase diagram theoretically was determined .",
    "we have found that the crystal nucleus formation time of cbn is less than @xmath2 by comparing of our theoretical calculation and experiment . in this paper",
    "the temperature effect was not considered .",
    "if the temperature effect is considered , then the activation energy will be decreased , so that the crystal nucleus formation time of cbn will be decreased ."
