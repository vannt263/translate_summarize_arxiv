    "squeezed spin states , which were firstly introduced by kitagawa and ueda @xcite , are quantum correlated states with reduced fluctuations in one of the collective spin components @xcite .",
    "such states have attracted considerable interest because they not only play significant roles in investigating many - body entanglement @xcite , but also have important applications in atom interferometers and high - precision atom clocks @xcite . in general , there are two methods to produce spin squeezing .",

    "since the scaling of @xmath4 approaches the heisenberg limit , implementing the two - axis twisting hamiltonian in current experimental setups is very important and necessary @xcite .",
    "a proposing scheme is to transform the one - axis twisting hamiltonian into the two - axis twisting hamiltonian by applying pulse sequences or continuous driving in the two - component bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental realization of such two - axis twisting hamiltonian is still challenging .",
    "ultracold atoms in an ultrahigh - finesse optical cavity are also a powerful platform to produce spin squeezing since photon of cavity mode can induce nonlinear spin - spin interaction and thus generate the required one - axis twisting hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "recently , multi - mode cavities @xcite have attracted much attention both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "these setups can be used to explore novel physics , such as the spin - orbit - induced anomalous hall effect @xcite , the crystallization and frustration @xcite , the spin glass sg11,ps11,mb13,aa13 , and the gapless nambu - goldstone - type mode without rotating - wave approximation @xcite . moreover ,",
    "two - mode field squeezing @xcite and unconditional preparation of a two - mode squeezed state of effective bosonic modes @xcite have also been achieved by introducing two cavities . in the present paper , inspired by recent experiments of cavity - assisted raman transitions @xcite , we mainly realize a generalized two - axis spin hamiltonian by two cavities to enhance spin squeezing largely .",
