    "the study of solvability problems for the second order fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equation , i.e. , the existence , uniqueness and regularity of solutions with dirichlet boundary data can be divided into two classes naturally .",
    "the first one is about classical solvability , i.e. , solution @xmath4 . the related results are rich and systematic , see [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] and therein .",
    "all of them is obtained under the assumption of concavity for the equation with respect to their arguments .",
    "the second is without the concave condition of @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", we must seek for solution in generalized sense .",
    "the suitable one is viscosity solution[6 ] .",
    "but in this case the results are incomplete . because the regularity is a key stone for existence and uniqueness , we prove the interior @xmath1 continuity without the concavity assumption of @xmath2 in this paper and the existence and uniqueness results will be in next one .",
    "our assumptions are @xmath5 of its arguments only , weaker than those in caffarelli and wang[1 ] ( @xmath6 ) and chen [ 2](@xmath7 ) . and",
    "the result , @xmath8 is stronger than theirs ( @xmath9 and small ) .",
    "this paper is organized in five sections : the second is preliminaries , statements for conditions and the main results .",

    "the fourth is h@xmath18lder and lipschitz continuity .",
    "the h@xmath18lder and lipschitz estimates are obtained by selecting suitable @xmath19 and @xmath20 . although these results are not new , we prove them here for the sake of applications of the results of section 3 .",
    "the last section is @xmath1 estimate .",
    "having got the interior lipschitz estimate for @xmath21 , we can conclude that there exist caffarelli points such that in small neighborhood of them @xmath21 can be separated into linear and second order parts .",
    "we estimate the lipschitz coefficient of @xmath21 subtracting linear part in suitable neighborhood of caffarelli point by selecting suitable comparison function @xmath22 . by this way we get a fundamental lemma : the lipschitz coefficient is diminishing in certain constant ratio accompanied with diminishing of radius of spherical neighborhood in suitably constant ratio .",
    "the @xmath23 estimate and @xmath1 in small part follows from this fundamental lemma . and the @xmath1 estimate in the whole region follows by putting the estimates in small parts altogether .",
