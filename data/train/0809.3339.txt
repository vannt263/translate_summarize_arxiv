    "ultra - luminous compact x - ray sources ( ulxs ; e.g. , @xcite ) , found in many nearby galaxies , are often considered as candidate intermediate - mass black holes ( bhs ) , because their typical luminosity reaching @xmath9 to @xmath10 erg s@xmath3 , calculated assuming isotropic radiation , largely exceeds the eddington limit for known stellar - mass bhs . since the first discovery by the einstein satellite @xcite , ulxs have been studied extensively in soft x - rays with rosat @xcite , and then in energies up to @xmath11 kev with asca @xcite , chandra ( e.g. @xcite ) , xmm - newton ( e.g. @xcite ) , and suzaku @xcite . searches for their counterparts have also been carried out in the optical ( e.g. @xcite ) and radio ( e.g. @xcite ) wavelengths .",
    "in contrast , we have little information on ulxs in hard x - rays above 10 kev , where the established mass - accreting bhs , including both stellar - mass ones and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , are known to emit a considerable fraction of their radiative luminosity .    among a number of ulxs known so far ,",
    "so - called source x-1 in the starburst galaxy m82 is the most extreme object , as the luminosity reached @xmath10 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "although the host galaxy m82 has been observed repeatedly with the past x - ray observatories due to its nearby location ( @xmath12 mpc ; @xcite ) and its active star formation , the bright diffuse thermal x - rays from this galaxy hampered the detection of x-1 till the asca era .",
    "the presence of this object , x-1 , was first suspected by @xcite , based on differences of fluxes measured with exsoat , ginga , and asca .",
    "subsequently , the object was confirmed as a variable hard source through multiple asca observations , and interpreted at first as an active galactic nucleus veiled by the thermal plasma emission @xcite .",
    "however , thanks to the superb angular resolution of chandra , it was later revealed to be a non - agn source located @xmath13 pc off the dynamical center of the galaxy @xcite .    to explain the highest luminosity ( @xmath14 erg s@xmath3 in 320 kev ; @xcite ) recorded from m82 x-1 , a mass of at least 700 @xmath15 is necessary assuming isotropic radiation with a sub - eddington luminosity .",
    "moreover , the 54 mhz x - ray quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) , detected with xmm - newton and rxte @xcite , suggests that the source , presumably a bh , has a mass of 100300 @xmath15 , assuming the qpo frequency to scale inversely with the bh mass .",
    "these results , together with a recent study of variability pattern @xcite , make m82 x-1 the most promising candidate for an intermediate - mass bh .",
    "it is also suggested to have a 62 day periodicity @xcite .",
    "spectral studies of m82 x-1 have been conducted extensively . with asca and xmm - newton ,",
    "however , such attempts were limited to relatively narrow bands , e.g. , 210 kev , because of the surrounding bright thermal x - rays . as a result",
    ", the observed spectra were reproduced by a variety of spectral models , including a power - law ( pl ) of photon index @xmath16 @xcite , a thermal plasma emission model with a temperature 411 kev @xcite , an unsaturated comptonization model @xcite , and slim - disk emission @xcite .",
    "since these modelings imply vastly different physical conditions of the emission region , the nature of m82 x-1 has remained ambiguous .",
    "for example , the slim - disk modeling by @xcite leads to a bh mass of @xmath17 , which is significantly lower than is implied by the other arguments .",
    "another complication with x-1 is that it is heavily confused with other point sources in the core region of m82 .",
    "these confusion problems have been resolved by chandra with its high angular resolution .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that the 0.38 kev band spectrum of x-1 can be represented by a pl model of a photon index @xmath18 .",
    "neverthelss , the information is still insufficient to arrive at a clear scenario as to the nature of x-1 .",
    "evidently , the detection of x-1 in harder energies is of crucial importance .",
    "the large area counter onboard ginga , sensitive over the 230 kev energy band , detected signals up to @xmath1920 kev from the m82 galaxy , and yielded a spectrum which is better described by a thermal bremsstrahlung model of temperature @xmath20 kev than by a single pl model @xcite .",
    "the emission , interpreted at that time as arising from a thin hot plasma , is now more likely to be attributable primarily to x-1 .",
    "@xcite successfully described a 330 kev bepposax spectrum of m82 by a thermal plasma model of temperature @xmath21 kev .",
    "furthermore , rxte observations of m82 on 30 occasions yielded 350 kev spectra @xcite ; the spectra acquired in brighter and fainter phases were both reproduced by thermal plasma models , with a temperature of @xmath22 and @xmath23 kev , respectively . these existing results in harder energies commonly indicate mildly curving broad - band spectra , rather than a pl - like one .",
    "however , the fields - of - view ( fovs ) of these non - imaging instruments also contained the spiral galaxy m81 , hosting a low - luminosity agn @xcite , located @xmath24 away from m82 .",
    "therefore , possible contamination to the observed signal was not excluded .",
    "the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) onboard suzaku @xcite , with its unprecedented sensitivity in a broad ( 10600 kev ) energy band and a tightly collimated fov of @xmath25 ( fwhm ) , is expected to provide improved hard x - ray information on m82 x-1 . here",
    ", we report on the suzaku detection of m82 x-1 up to @xmath5 kev , and interpret the results in terms of an intermediate - mass bh .",
    "we observed m82 with suzaku three times in the science working group ( swg ) phase ; on 2005 october 4 ut11:50 through october 5 ut03:24 , october 19 ut00:4022:32 , and october 27 ut11:05 through 28 ut02:24 . aiming primarily at the study of hot - gas outflows from m82",
    ", the three observations were all conducted with the xis optical axis pointed at @xmath26 , which is @xmath27 north of the galaxy .",
    "the xis results on this offset region have already been published as @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the central region of this galaxy , including in particular x-1 .",
    "figure [ fig : image ] shows an xis  0 image in the 210 kev band from the second observation .",
    "the x - ray bright part coincides with the central region of m82 , including luminous x - ray sources such as x-1 .",
    "the m81 nucleus during this observation was right on the edge of the hxd - pin fov , where the transmission is @xmath28 even considering attitude uncertainties .",
    "similarly , the hxd - pin transmission for m81 was @xmath29 both in the first and third observations .    as shown in the figure ,",
    "two ulxs known in the present sky region , m81 x-6 and holmberg xi x-1 (= m81 x-9 ; @xcite ) , were both outside the hxd - pin fov .",
    "we used the software package headas version 6.3.1 and xselect version 2.4 to extract light curves , images , and spectra , and xspec version 11 to analyze the spectra .",
    "the xis and hxd datasets were screened by the revision 1.2 pipeline processing using the standard criteria as follows .",
    "events were discarded if they were acquired under the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , or at regions of low cutoff rigidity ( @xmath30 gv for xis and @xmath31 gev c@xmath3 for hxd ) , or with the earth elevation angle of @xmath32 , or during those periods when the telemetry was saturated .",
    "the xis events were further excluded when the source elevation above the sunlit earth is @xmath33 , and finally events with grade 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 were selected .",
    "after these screenings , the three observations gave effective exposure of 29 ks , 36 ks , and 26 ks with the xis , while 24 ks , 31 ks , and 22 ks with the hxd .",
    "we extracted on - source xis events from a region of @xmath1 radius centered on the m82 nucleus , and background events from another region of @xmath1 radius which is free from the diffuse x - ray emission associated with m82 . in figure",
    "[ fig : image ] , these two regions are indicated by dashed circles . we utilize events from all four ccd cameras , after co - adding those from the three fi cameras ( xis  0 , xis  2 , and xis  3 ) which have virtually identical responses .",
    "figure [ fig : lc_xis ] shows 210 kev xis  0 light curves obtained in the three observations .",
    "the background counts are negligible ( @xmath34 ) , compared to the signal counts which were determined as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 cts s@xmath3 in the three observations ( the errors being 90% confidence ranges ) .",
    "thus , the signal on the second and third occasions are higher by @xmath38 and lower by @xmath39 , respectively , than that in the first observation . by fitting these light curves with a constant",
    ", we obtained @xmath40 ( degree of freedom ) of 95.7/95 , 190.0/131 , and 110.1/87 , respectively .",
    "the probability of these signal counts being consistent with a constant value is @xmath19 40% , 1% , and 5% , in the first , second , and third observations , respectively .",
    "therefore , the source is likely to have varied during the second observation ; in fact , the light curve suggests a gradual intensity increase by @xmath41 across the gross coverage of about one day .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_xis_wide ] shows 0.510 kev spectra from the fi ccd ( black ; averaged over xis  0 , xis  2 , and xis  3 ) and the bi ccd ( gray ; xis  1 ) , obtained by accumulating events over the source region of figure [ fig : image ] , and then subtracting those from the background region . to grasp the rough spectral properties",
    ", we tentatively summed up the three observations .",
    "thus , the spectra are dominated by a rather hard continuum at energies above @xmath42 kev , whereas by line - rich softer thermal emission at lower energies .",
    "as confirmed through past observations , the hard continuum must be coming from luminous point x - ray sources including x-1 in particular , while the soft thermal emission from the diffuse hot plasmas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a rough evaluation using a thermal model and a pl continuum indicates that the xis spectra in energies above 3.2 kev ( i.e. , above k@xmath43 line at 3.14 kev from h - like ar ) are contaminated by the thermal component by no more than 9% . since we are interested in x-1 , below we study the xis spectra in the 3.210 kev range , discarding their softer part .    in the hard - band xis spectra",
    ", we observe an emission line structure at 67 kev ; this must be fe - k lines , as reported in previous observations ( e.g. @xcite ) . using the chandra and xmm - newton data",
    ", @xcite spectrally resolved the iron line complex into 6.7 kev ( from he - like iron ) and 6.4 kev ( from nearly neutral iron ) components , and showed that both are primarily distributed diffusely rather than associated with discrete sources .      through the method described in section 2 , we extracted the hxd - pin data from the three observations .",
    "although the data covers an energy range of 1070 kev , we hereafter discard the lowest energy band of 1012 kev , where the data are often affected by increased noise .",
    "light curves and spectra are corrected for instrumental dead times after @xcite and @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we do not intend to analyze the hxd - gso data , since the signals from m82 are estimated to be below the gso detection limit . in addition , the hxd - gso fov becomes progressively wider above @xmath44 kev , and hence the contamination by m81 becomes difficult to eliminate .      to perform background subtraction which is crucial for the hxd analysis , we utilized non x - ray background ( nxb ) models provided by the hxd detector team @xcite . when the present data analysis was carried out @xcite ,",
    "there were two nxb models available , so - called _ bgd_a _ ( watanabe et al .",
    ", suzakumemo-2007 - 01 ) and _ bgd_d _ ( dead - time uncorrected ; fukazawa et al . , suzakumemo-2007 - 02 ) , which employ different algorithms .",
    "we produced fake background events using the two nxb models , both under the same observing conditions as the actual data , and both utilizing the same auxiliary information such as the measured upper - discriminator hit rates . by processing the fake events through the same screening criteria as for the actual on - source data",
    ", we derived two nxb event sets for each observation .",
    "then , _ bgd_a _ and _ bgd_d _ respectively gave 1270 kev count rates of 0.46 and 0.45 cts s@xmath3 on october 4 , 0.49 and 0.48 cts s@xmath3 on october 19 , and 0.52 and 0.50 cts s@xmath3 on october 27 .",
    "thus , the two nxb models agree within 4% .",
    "hereafter , we employ _",
    "bgd_a _ for our spectral analysis , because it tends to systematically over - predict the nxb than the other model in this particular observation , and hence is expected to yield more conservative results for sources like m82 x-1 that are close to the hxd - pin detection limit .",
    "we examined the nxb modeling accuracy utilizing earth - occulted data , assuming the earth to be  dark \" for hxd - pin .",
    "these data were extracted using the same criteria as for the on - source data , except that the earth elevation angle was required to be @xmath45 instead of @xmath46 .",
    "the attained exposure was 5.3 ks on october 19 and 1.3 ks on october 27 , while the october 4 data were free from earth occultations .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_pin_earth ] compares the observed earth - occultation data , with the synthetic _",
    "bgd_a _ spectra which emulate the nxb to be observed during these occultation periods .",
    "the observed and modeled nxb count rates in the 1270 kev energy range are @xmath47 and 0.55 cts s@xmath3 respectively on october 19 , and @xmath48 and 0.54 cts s@xmath3 on october 27 likewise , where the errors refer to 90% confidence levels .",
    "statistical errors associated with the nxb model are neglected , because the model produces 10 times larger number of fake events .",
    "when the energy band is limited to 1220 kev , where signals are detected as described later , the observed and modeled nxb count rates become @xmath49 and 0.31 cts s@xmath3 respectively on october 19 , and @xmath50 and 0.30 cts s@xmath3 on october 27 likewise .    as confirmed above , the earth - occultation data and the modeled nxb data agree well with each other within statistic errors , which are 4% and 10% , on october 19 and 27 , respectively .",
    "this statement applies both to the 1270 kev and 1220 kev bands . further considering the nxb modeling accuracy of hxd - pin",
    "which is generally @xmath515% @xcite , and the 4% difference between the two nxb models , we hereafter regard that the nxb model correctly reproduces the hxd - pin nxb within a systematic error of at most 4% .      after the above preparations",
    ", we accumulated the on - source hxd - pin data of m82 , and derived 1220 kev count rates from the three observations . in table",
    "[ tbl : cr_pin ] , these results are compared with the nxb model predictions in the same energy band . in all three observations , the on - source data exhibit an excess count rate by @xmath52 cts s@xmath3 above the modeled nxb . of these excess counts , we expect 0.018 cts s@xmath3 to be coming from the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , as calculated from the heao-1 results @xcite . further subtracting this cxb contribution , we are finally left with 0.0160.027 cts s@xmath3 ( table  [ tbl : cr_pin ] ) in 1220 kev to be attributable to the net signals from m82 .",
    "although the 1220 kev cxb intensity within the hxd - pin fov is expected to fluctuate by @xmath53 ( rms ) from sky to sky , this is only to @xmath54 of the nxb in the same energy range , because the average cxb count rate therein , typically @xmath55 of the nxb , is already low .",
    "thus , the cxb fluctuation is negligible .",
    "the pin signals , remaining after subtracting the nxb and cxb , have statistical significance of 3 to 5 sigmas on individual observations , and 8 sigmas when the three data sets are summed together .",
    "furthermore , the implied 1220 kev signal rates , @xmath56 cts s@xmath3 , amount to 610% of the nxb count rate in the same band .",
    "this exceeds the typical nxb reproducibility during the present observations , 4% , as estimated in section  [ subsubsec : pin_background ] .",
    "therefore , the positive signals are thought to be significant even considering the systematic nxb errors .    after we had completed our data analysis , the background model _",
    "bgd_d _ was updated , by taking into account dead - time correction and improving the estimation method ( mizuno et al .",
    ", suzakumemo-2008 - 03 ) .",
    "accordingly , we re - generated the background files using this improved method , to find that it gives essentially the same results as the previous _ bgd_d_. therefore , we retain our original choice of _ bgd_a _",
    ", which tends to overestimate the nxb and hence gives more conservative results .",
    "we later examine the effects of these different background models by artificially changing the nxb by @xmath57 .",
    "as described in section  [ subsec : xis ] , the xis signal from the central region of m82 exhibited rather small ( if any ) variations during the present observations . supposing that the positive hxd - pin signals , as revealed above , are also coming from an approximately identical region in m82 , we expect rather constant count rates as well . if , on the other hand , the positive hxd - pin counts were an artifact of wrong nxb subtraction , they would vary with time typically on time scales of minutes to hours , just reflecting those in the nxb @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , the 1220 kev pin light curves of the three observation were derived , and presented in figure [ fig : lc_pin ] together with the behavior of the modeled nxb .",
    "on all occasions , the background - subtracted counts in figure  [ fig : lc_pin ] thus show on - average positive values , which agree with those in table [ tbl : cr_pin ] .",
    "furthermore , the net signal ( green ) appears relatively constant within statistical errors , in contrast to significant raw - count variations ( black ) that reflect those in the nxb ( red ) .",
    "when fitted with a constant , these background - subtracted light curves yield @xmath40 of 41.7/28 , 42.8/39 , and 31.2/30 , in the first , second , and third observations , respectively .",
    "these imply probabilities of @xmath19 5% , 35% , and 40% for the light curves to be consistent with being constant .",
    "thus , we consider that the positive hxd - pin counts listed in table  [ tbl : cr_pin ] persisted throughout the observations , while the variable nxb was removed successfully .    in this way , we have carefully examined the hxd - pin signals using the earth - occultation data and the on - source light curves .",
    "the results confirm that the positive hxd - pin signals above the cxb are real , and are coming from the m82 sky region .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_pin ] shows the full - range pin spectra ( black ) from the three observations , compared with the corresponding nxb models ( _ bgd_a _ ; red ) .",
    "the figure also shows the nxb - subtracted data ( green ) , and the predicted cxb spectrum ( blue ) based on the heao-1 results @xcite .",
    "thus , after the nxb subtraction , positive signals remain up to @xmath0 kev in all three observations .",
    "furthermore , the signal exceeds the expected cxb at least up to @xmath5 kev . in the 1220 kev band ,",
    "these spectra imply an average signal count rate of @xmath58 cts s@xmath3 above the cxb .",
    "this value agrees with that derived from the simple count - rate measurements ( section  [ subsubsec : pin_counts ] ; table [ tbl : cr_pin ] ) , and the light curve analysis ( section  [ subsubsec : pin_lightcurve ] ) .      in this subsection , we perform model fitting first to the xis spectra , and then to those of hxd - pin , both averaged over the 3 days . afterwards",
    ", the xis and hxd - pin spectra are jointly analyzed .      among the three observations ,",
    "the 3.210 kev xis spectra differ to some extent in their normalization ; as inferred from figure  [ fig : lc_xis ] , those of the 2nd and 3rd observations are higher by 2.1% and lower by 10.6% , respectively , than that of the first occasion .",
    "however , after scaling by these factors , the three spectra agree with one another within their errors , which are typically 5% per channel under the present binning .",
    "therefore , we hereafter analyze the xis spectra summed over the 3 observations .",
    "we jointly fitted the 3.210 kev xis fi and bi spectra , thus summed over the three observations , with a model consisting of a pl for the continuum and two gaussians for the fe - k@xmath59 lines .",
    "the xis response file and the associated ancillary file was generated with `` xisrmfgen '' and `` xissimarfgen '' tool , respectively @xcite .",
    "we constrained the overall model normalization to be the same between the fi and bi detectors .",
    "the hydrogen column density describing photoelectric absorption is here and hereafter fixed at @xmath60 @xmath4 , as determined with chandra @xcite under the least contamination by the diffuse emission : this amount of absorption attenuates the continuum at 3.2 kev only by 10% , and if treated as a free parameter , the absorption would couple too strongly with the continuum slope . the model yielded a fit as shown in figure [ fig : spec_xis ] ( left ) , with the best - fit parameters summarized in table  [ tbl : spec_para ] under the column of  xis - only \" .",
    "thus , the pl photon index became @xmath61 .",
    "although not given in the table , one gaussian is centered at an energy of @xmath62 kev , with an intrinsic width ( in gaussian sigma ) of @xmath63 kev and an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath64 ev .",
    "its inclusion improved the fit by @xmath65 .",
    "the other gaussian , with its energy fixed at 6.4 kev and assumed to be narrow , exhibited an ew of @xmath66 ev , and improved the fit by @xmath67 .",
    "the 210 kev flux detected with the xis , averaged over the three data sets , becomes @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , which yields a 210 kev luminosity of @xmath68 erg s@xmath3 at 3.6 mpc .",
    "this is typical of , or relatively lower than , those measured previously from narrow regions ( depending on the angular resolution ) around x-1 , which scatter over @xmath69 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the above model approximately reproduces the observed xis spectra , the fit is formally unacceptable with @xmath70 ( table  [ tbl : spec_para ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : spec_xis]a , the model overpredicts the data above @xmath71 kev , suggesting the spectrum to have a more convex shape than a simple pl .",
    "actually , the best - fit photon index becomes discrepant as @xmath72 and @xmath73 , when the fit energy range is restricted to 3.26.0 kev and 710 kev , respectively .",
    "the pl fit could be made acceptable by allowing the low - energy absorption to vary freely , but then the column density must become @xmath74 @xmath4 , much exceeding the chandra value of @xmath75 @xmath4 @xcite . therefore ,",
    "the intrinsic continuum is suggested to be curved . to express such a convex shape",
    ", we fixed again the absorption to @xmath75 @xmath4 , and replaced the pl continuum by a cutoff pl model , namely a pl multiplied by an exponential cutoff factor . then ,",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : spec_xis]b and described in table  [ tbl : spec_para ] , the fit has become acceptable with @xmath76 , yielding @xmath77 and a cutoff energy of @xmath78 kev .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the spectrum has a more convex shape than a pl .",
    "we conducted similar model - fitting analyses to the background ( nxb+cxb ) subtracted 1220 kev pin spectra , again summed over the three observations .",
    "the fit utilized a response matrix at the hxd nominal position , ae_hxd_pinhxnom_20060814.rsp , and an ancillary response file generated by the hxdarfgen tool .",
    "the latter takes into account the fact that the hxd fov center is @xmath79 offset from the m82 nucleus .",
    "then , a pl model gave a successful fit with @xmath80 , yielding a photon index of @xmath81 ( statistical 90% confidence errors ) , and a 1220 kev flux of @xmath6 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "these become @xmath82 and @xmath83 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 if the nxb is artificially increased ( over - subtracted ) by 4% , while @xmath84 and @xmath85 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 when it is reduced ( under - subtracted ) by 4% . in any case , the implied spectral slope ( @xmath86 ) is significantly steeper than that found in the xis range ( @xmath87 ) , reinforcing the gradual spectral steepening found in the xis band .      in order to best utilize the wide - band capability of suzaku , we fitted the xis and hxd spectra simultaneously , using respective averages over the three observations . since the energy range becomes much expanded , we tried a larger variety of continuum models than employed so far . in all modelings ,",
    "the two gaussians were included in the same manner as in section  [ subsubsec : xis_fits ] .",
    "the model normalization was constrained to be the same between the xis and hxd - pin , because the hxd - pin ancillary response file ( section  [ subsubsec : pin_fits ] ) has already taken into account the different fovs between the two instruments ( assuming that the hxd - pin signal is coming from the m82 central region ) .",
    "the obtained fits are shown in figure  [ fig : spec_xis+pin ] , while the fit parameters are summarized in table [ tbl : spec_para ] under the column of  xis+pin \" .",
    "( the table also gives the results obtained without using the hxd data . ) furthermore , like in section  [ subsubsec : pin_fits ] , we considered the case where the nxb of hxd - pin is systematically changed by @xmath88 .",
    "first , we tried a pl model , but the joint fit was not acceptable with @xmath89 even allowing for the 4% nxb uncertainty ( table  [ tbl : spec_para ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : spec_xis+pin]a , the model over - predicts the xis and hxd - pin data in the energy ranges of @xmath90 kev .",
    "although the fit is improved to @xmath91 by tentatively allowing the model normalization to take separate values between the two instruments , the hxd vs. xis normalization ratio then became @xmath92 .",
    "this is too small , considering the xis vs. hxd calibration uncertainties which are at most @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "thus , the joint fit reinforces the inference made so far , that the x-1 spectrum is more convex than a pl .",
    "below , we return to our original procedure of equalizing the model normalization between the two instruments .",
    "next , we tried an empirical thermal bremsstrahlung ( bremss ) model .",
    "although the fit is better ( @xmath94 depending on the nxb systematic errors ) than the pl fit , the model is still over - predicting in the @xmath90 kev energy range as shown in figure [ fig : spec_xis+pin]b . the obtained temperature , @xmath95 kev , is higher than the values of @xmath96 kev measured with ginga @xcite , bepposax @xcite , and rxte @xcite .",
    "these results remain essentially unchanged even when changing the pin nxb by @xmath57 .",
    "third , we employed a cutoff pl model .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : spec_xis+pin]c and table [ tbl : spec_para ] , it has given @xmath97 , together with @xmath98 and @xmath99 kev .",
    "therefore , this model remains successful even including the hxd - pin data . because a cutoff pl gives an approximation to an unsaturated thermal comptonization process of some soft seed photons , we replaced it with a thermal comptonization model , called `` comptt '' @xcite in ` xspec ` .",
    "since the input soft - photon energy is not well constrained by the present data , we fixed it to several values between 0.1 and 0.3 kev .",
    "then , as presented in figure [ fig : spec_xis+pin]d , the fit was similarly acceptable with @xmath100 , and gave an electron temperature of @xmath101 kev and an optical depth of @xmath102 ; the results were essentially independent of the soft - photon temperature in the above - mentioned range .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 are both consistent with the xmm - newton results on m82 x-1 by @xcite .    finally , to evaluate a scenario of emission from an optically - thick accretion disk",
    ", we tested a  disk blackbody \" ( ` diskbb ` ) model which represents multi - color blackbody emission from a standard accretion disk @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : spec_xis+pin]e , the fit was rather poor with @xmath105 , because the model has too convex a shape and hence under - predicts the data in the higher energy range . to improve the fit",
    ", we then generalized the ` diskbb ` model to  variable-@xmath106 \" model @xcite .",
    "it assumes that the disk temperature scales as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the radius and @xmath106 is a free parameter , with @xmath109 corresponding to ` diskbb ` .",
    "it gives a good approximation to emission from a slim disk @xcite , which is expected to form under very high accretion rates .",
    "the fit has then become acceptable with @xmath110 ( figure [ fig : spec_xis+pin]f ) , and the obtained parameters , namely the inner - disk temperature @xmath111 kev and @xmath112 , are consistent with those of @xcite who applied the the same model to the xmm - newton data of x-1 acquired at a similar luminosity to the present case .    from these studies",
    ", we have found three models that successfully and simultaneously reproduce the xis and hxd - pin data .",
    "a cutoff pl model with @xmath113 kev , a comptt model invoking a relatively cool and thick electron cloud , and a variable-@xmath106 model with a very high disk temperature .",
    "in all these cases , the two gaussians were found to take nearly the same parameters as found with the xis ( section  [ subsubsec : xis_fits ] ) .",
    "as seen from table  [ tbl : spec_para ] , the addition of the hxd - pin data have little affected the best - fit parameters of these successful models , with similar or somewhat reduced errors .",
    "in contrast , their inclusion has allowed us to much more securely exclude the other unsuccessful models . in this sense ,",
    "the xis and hxd - pin data are fully consistent with each other . when the nxb level is artificially changed by @xmath57 , the fit goodness of all the three successful models degrades considerably .",
    "this reinforces the correctness of the nxb subtraction , unless the detected signal has a very complex broad - band continuum shape which requires a composite modeling .",
    "although we have so far quantified the broad - band suzaku spectra , the results may not be totally ascribed to x-1 , because the hxd - pin data are likely to be contaminated by m81 , as well as by other discrete sources in m82 .",
    "the latter must contaminate the xis data as well , because many of them are clustered in too narrow a region , @xmath114 in radius around the m82 center , to be resolved with the xis .      as described in section  [ sec : observations ] and illustrated in firgure  [ fig : image ] , the m81 nucleus was on the edge of the hxd - pin fov , with transmission of at most @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the contamination is expected to be small , but may not be totally neglected .    using bepposax , @xcite measured the 10100 kev flux of the m81 nucleus as @xmath116 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , and described its spectrum by a pl with @xmath117 .",
    "the 1220 kev flux is implied to be @xmath118 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 . according to @xcite , furthermore",
    ", the m81 nucleus varied in the 0.52.4 kev band by a factor of 4 through past observations , and became up to @xmath119 times as bright as observed by @xcite .",
    "adopting an extreme assumption that the m81 nucleus was at its brightest level during the present observations , and that the spectrum retained @xmath120 , the angular transmission described in section  [ sec : observations ] predicts this low - luminosity agn to contribute up to @xmath121 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 to the 1220 kev hxd - pin data .",
    "these correspond to @xmath122 of the background - subtracted pin flux ( section  [ subsubsec : pin_fits ] ) .",
    "taking an exposure - weighted mean over the three occasions , the m81 contamination to the hxd - pin signal is estimated to be at most 10% . since the pin spectra in figure  [ fig : spec_xis+pin ] have statistical errors of several tens percent per bin , and since m81 may not have been in the brightest phase , we conclude that the effect of the m81 nucleus is negligible .",
    "this is an advantage of the hxd with its tightly collimated fov .      besides x-1 , the central region within @xmath114 of the m82 nucleus harbors about a dozen x - ray point sources more luminous than @xmath123 erg s@xmath3 @xcite . to study their fluxes and spectra , and",
    "estimate their contamination to the present suzaku results , we re - visited the chandra archival data . by 2007",
    "august , the central regions of m82 were observed six times with the chandra acis for exposures longer than 10 ks ; these are obsid 361 , 1302 , 2933 , 6097 , 5644 , and 6361 . using the ciao 3.4 software package and standard screening criteria , we extracted point sources which are located within @xmath124 of x-1 ; these can contaminate both the present xis and hxd spectra . referring to the rosat pspc image ,",
    "any x - ray sources that are outside the xis integration radius but within the hxd - pin fov are considered negligible .    through this analysis",
    ", we confirmed the report by @xcite that a second brightest source , which they call x42.3 + 59 , is located at @xmath125 off x-1 ; we hereafter call it x-2 . across the six chandra observations , the 210 kev flux of x-2 varied largely , from less than @xmath126 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 to @xmath127 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , with the latter amounting to 1/3 of the 210 kev xis signal flux .",
    "as already reported by @xcite , the 38 kev spectrum of x-2 at its brightest phase was described by a pl with @xmath128 , absorbed by a column of @xmath129 @xmath4 , and a soft - excess component was required if lower energies are included .",
    "fainter x - ray sources , other than x-1 and x-2 , were found to have a 210 kev luminositiy of @xmath130 erg s@xmath3 each . among the six chandra observations ,",
    "their summed 210 kev flux remained relatively constant at @xmath131 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , which accounts for about 1/3 of the xis signal .",
    "their summed 38 kev spectrum was reproduced by a pl with @xmath132 .    as shown so far",
    ", we expect the fainter discrete sources to account for about 1/3 of the detected xis signal .",
    "furthermore , another 1/3 could be ascribed to x-2 if it is in the brightest phase .",
    "therefore , the soft x - ray flux actually attributable to x-1 is estimated to be 2/3 ( if x-2 is very faint ) to 1/3 ( if x-2 is brightest ) of the detected 210 kev xis signal of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 ( section  [ subsubsec : xis_fits ] ) .",
    "these contaminants are expected to introduce a larger uncertainty to the hxd - pin results , because their hard x - ray spectra can not be measured separately .",
    "below , we consider this issue assuming two extreme cases .",
    "we first consider an extreme case where x-2 is faint enough to be neglected , and hence we need to consider only the fainter sources .",
    "if their summed spectrum determined with chandra ( a pl with @xmath132 ) were extending into the hard x - ray range , the implied counts at 30 kev would reach @xmath41 of the hxd - pin background , which is well above the systematic background uncertainty . furthermore , the 30 40 kev signals , attainable with hxd - pin in the 77 ks exposure ( the three observations summed ) , would have a statistical significance exceeding 6 sigmas .",
    "thus , we must have detected their signals at least up to @xmath133 kev , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : spec_contami]a .",
    "however , the actual 1220 kev pin spectrum was rather soft with @xmath134 , and was undetectable above @xmath5 kev . therefore , the summed spectrum from the fainter sources should bend in energies above @xmath71 kev .",
    "this is reasonable , because these sources are considered to be mainly luminous low - mass x - ray binaries , of which the 220 kev spectrum is empirically approximated by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with a temperature of @xmath135 kev @xcite .",
    "such a bremsstrahlung model has a mildly curved shape , and its 38 kev portion can be approximated by a pl with @xmath136 @xcite , in agreement with the chandra measurement .    with the above consideration ,",
    "we modeled the summed contribution of the faint sources by a @xmath137 kev thermal bremsstrahlung model , of which the 210 kev flux was fixed at @xmath138 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 as specified by the chandra data . including this model as a fixed component , we jointly re - fitted the same suzaku xis and pin spectra using the same family of models as in section  [ subsubsec : joint_fits ] . as shown in table [ tbl : spec_contami_para ] under the column  case 1 \" , and presented in figure  [ fig : spec_contami]b , the obtained results are close to those obtained before . however , the inferred x-1 spectrum became softer , because the @xmath137 kev thermal bremsstrahlung model , which is now subtracted away , is somewhat harder than the original wide - band suzaku spectrum .",
    "as a result , not only the successful three models , but also the simple multi - color disk model with @xmath139 kev , have become acceptable .",
    "equivalently , the variable-@xmath106 model gave @xmath140 , which just implies a standard accretion disk .",
    "after subtracting the contamination , the 210 kev flux attributable to x-1 becomes @xmath141 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , and the luminosity therein is @xmath142 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "as the other extreme , we may consider the case where the present observations happened to catch x-2 at its brightest level ever recorded by chandra , and hence its contribution to the suzaku spectra must be considered as well .",
    "although the x-2 spectrum obtained by chandra at the brightest epoch was rather hard ( @xmath143 ) , it can not keep extending into the @xmath144 kev energy range , for the same reason as discussed just above for the fainter sources .",
    "thus , the x-2 spectrum is inferred to have a power - law shape in the 38 kev range , together with a high - energy turn over , and a soft excess @xcite .",
    "such a spectral composition is typical of ",
    "pl state \" ulxs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although these objects generally have a steeper range of spectra with @xmath145 , a case with @xmath146 is known @xcite . regarding x-2 as such an object",
    ", we decided to express its spectrum by a cutoff pl model with @xmath147 and a cutoff energy of @xmath148 kev , absorbed with @xmath149 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the adopted cutoff energy is a typical value found among power - law type ulxs @xcite , and the photon index of 0.5 was chosen so that the model , of the form @xmath150 , mimics the @xmath151 pl in the 38 kev band .",
    "its normalization was adjusted to reproduce the chandra flux .    including these two fixed models ( one for x-2 and the other for the fainter sources )",
    ", we repeated the fitting procedure ; the obtained results are presented in figure  [ fig : spec_contami]c , and the parameters are given in table [ tbl : spec_contami_para ] under the column denoted  case 2 \" .",
    "although the 210 kev flux attributable to x-1 further decreased to @xmath152 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , and its 210 kev luminosity to @xmath153 erg s@xmath3 , the spectral results have remained mostly the same as the case of x-2 being negligible .",
    "this is because the assumed x-2 spectrum is relatively similar in shape to the original suzaku xis plus hxd - pin spectra , as is clear from the cutoff pl fit parameters in table  [ tbl : spec_para ] .",
    "these studies confirm that the removal of the estimated contributions from x-2 ( under the most extreme assumption ) and the other fainter sources leaves significant 320 kev counts that are attributable to x-1 .",
    "these remaining hard x - ray photons still form a clearly curved spectrum , which excludes a pl and a thermal bremsstrahlung modeling , similar to the case of ignoring the contamination . thus , except for the normalization , our basic results on x-1 are relatively unaffected by the contaminating sources , in spite of apparently large uncertainties that they introduce .",
    "this is because we would encounter an unphysical condition of negative x-1 flux at @xmath5 kev if the contaminants had significantly harder spectra , while we can simply utilize the parameters in table  [ tbl : spec_para ] if the spectra of the contaminants were much softer and hence negligible in the hxd - pin range .",
    "with the suzaku xis , we detected a 210 kev flux of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 that is attributable to the assembly of luminous point sources within @xmath1 of the nucleus of m82 .",
    "of this flux , about 2/3 can be accounted for by the sum of the two most luminous sources , x-1 and x-2 , whereas the remaining 1/3 is ascribed to the other fainter ones .",
    "the share of 2/3 is totally attributable to x-1 if the highly variable x-2 was negligibly dim at that time , whereas it is further subdivided roughly equally between x-1 and x-2 if x-2 was at the brightest state ever recorded .",
    "we hence estimate the 210 kev flux of x-1 as @xmath154 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , and its 210 luminosity as @xmath155 erg s@xmath3 at 3.6 mpc , both with a typical systematic uncertainty by a factor of two .",
    "the estimated luminosity of x-1 is similar to , or somewhat lower than , those so far measured from this source .    from a wider sky region",
    "including m82 , we also detected significant hard x - ray emission with the suzaku hxd - pin , at a 1220 kev flux of @xmath6 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "when summed over the three observations , the hxd - pin signal ( after subtracting the nxb and cxb ) has a statistical significance of 8 sigmas , and about twice as high as the systematic background uncertainty .",
    "therefore , the signal is considered real .",
    "the hxd data define a rather steep spectrum with @xmath86 .",
    "the acquired hxd - pin data are fully consistent with them coming from the same sources as detected with the xis . regardless of the way of removing the estimated contamination from x-2 and the fainter sources ( section [ subsec : contami ] ) , the overall suzaku spectrum , spanning 320 kev ( with a narrow gap over 1012 kev ) , is clearly more convex than a single pl , even though it can be approximated by a pl over a limited 38 kev range .",
    "this reconfirms previous broad - band studies with ginga @xcite , bepposax @xcite , and rxte @xcite , which all reported  thermal \" type spectral shapes rather than straight pl like ones . clearly , relativistic jet emission , invoked by some authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) to explain the behavior of some ulxs , is inappropriate at least in the case of m82 x-1 , since the observed spectral curvature ( @xmath156 across @xmath11 kev ) is too strong to be attributable to synchrotron cooling or burn - off effects .    the curved spectrum of m82 x-1 can be expressed by either of the three successful continuum models ; an empirical cutoff pl model , a thermal comptonization model invoking a cool and thick electron cloud , and an optically - thick emission from a rather hot accretion disk ( section [ subsec : contami ] ) . details of their model parameters depend to some extent on the assumed broad - band spectra of the contaminants .",
    "superposed on the continuum , we also detected two iron emission lines .",
    "although ulxs show a variety of spectral shapes , two prototypical spectral states have been recognized through past observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "pl state \" , wherein the spectrum below @xmath11 kev is approximated by a single pl model , but is often accompanied by a soft excess ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as a mild turn - over toward higher energies ( e.g. , @xmath157 kev ; @xcite ) .",
    "we already argued in section  [ subsubsec : reeval ] that the second brightest source , m82 x-2 , is likely to be an object in the pl state .",
    "the other is  convex - spectrum ( hereafter cs ) state \" @xcite , in which the spectrum exhibits a significantly curved shape even in the limited energy range of @xmath158 to @xmath11 kev , so that an mcd model gives a better fit than a pl .",
    "the two ulx states are not considered to represent distinct classes of objects , since an increasing number of sources are confirmed to make transitions between these two spectral states ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite utilized suzaku data on ngc  1313 , to study spectral properties of two ulxs therein , x-1 and x-2 .",
    "then , x-2 was found in the cs state , and its 0.510 kev spectrum was represented successfully by a variable-@xmath106 model with @xmath159 and @xmath160 kev . in contrast , the other source , x-1 , was in the pl state , because its spectrum was much less convex ( approximated by a pl with @xmath161 ) , with a hint of soft excess and a mild high - energy turn over .",
    "thus , the xis spectrum of ngc  1313 x-1 was reproduced successfully by a cutoff pl continuum with @xmath162 kev and @xmath163 , plus a cool ( @xmath164 kev ) ` diskbb ` for the soft excess .",
    "the source exhibited a rather high 0.410 kev luminosity of @xmath165 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "as clarified in the present study , the suzaku spectrum of m82 x-1 is approximated by a pl model with @xmath166 in the limited 38 kev range , while it is reproduced by a cutoff pl model with @xmath167 kev and @xmath168 ( table  [ tbl : spec_contami_para ] ) when the broad 320 kev band is incorporated .",
    "these spectral properties of m82 x-1 , as well as its luminosity , are very similar to those of ngc  1313 x-1 as recorded with suzaku , although the values of @xmath169 differ by @xmath170 .",
    "based on these similarities , we conclude that m82 x-1 was in the pl state during the present observations .",
    "this also implies that m82 x-1 can be regarded as an  ordinary \" ulx , rather than a more enigmatic class of accreting source , even though it is rather extreme in terms of the luminosity .",
    "while the cutoff pl is a purely empirical model without physical meaning , it approximates the process of unsaturated thermal comptonization ( section [ subsubsec : joint_fits ] ) .",
    "in fact , the 320 kev spectrum of m82 x-1 has also been reproduced reasonably well by the ` comptt ` model ( table  [ tbl : spec_contami_para ] ) , invoking a rather low electron temperature of @xmath171 kev and a large optical depth of @xmath11 ; the condition is close to a nearly saturated comptonization . as mentioned in section [ subsubsec : joint_fits ] , the parameters derived here agree very well with those of the same object obtained by @xcite using the 310 kev xmm - newton epic data .",
    "the comptonization modeling has also provided reasonable account for the spectra , typically in the 110 kev bandbass , of other pl - state ulxs @xcite .    a valuable guideline to the understanding of ulxs may be provided by the study of galactic black - hole binaries ( bhbs ) @xcite .",
    "so far , a fair number of bhbs have been observed to leave the canonical standard - disk state , and enter  very high \" state @xcite , when their luminosities approach the corresponding eddington limits .",
    "then , the spectrum becomes dominated by a pl - like continuum with @xmath172 , plus a soft excess attributable to the underlying disk emission .",
    "such examples include gx339@xmath1734 @xcite , gs  @xmath174 @xcite , gro  j1655@xmath17340 @xcite , xte  j1550@xmath173564 @xcite , grs  @xmath175 @xcite , and 4u  1630@xmath17347 @xcite .",
    "these very - high state spectra of bhbs have been interpreted successfully by assuming that a cool standard accretion disk becomes surrounded by a cloud of hot electrons , or a  corona \" , so that a significant fraction of the disk photons get comptonized by the corona ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . according to @xcite , the rxte pca spectrum of gro  j1655@xmath17340 in the very high state",
    "can be understood by invoking a corona with an electron temperature of @xmath176 kev and a compton optical depth @xmath177 , located above a cool disk which supplies the seed photons .",
    "@xcite incorporated    the rxte hexte data of the same object and derived @xmath178 kev and @xmath179 . although the solutions thus degenerate , the compton @xmath180-parameter becomes in either case @xmath181 .    after the initial suggestion by @xcite and subsequent discussion by several authors @xcite , we presume that the pl state of ulxs is analogous to the very high state of bhbs , and that both appear at near the eddington luminosity .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of m82 x-1 during the present observation is estimated to be @xmath182 erg s@xmath3 , by integrating the cutoffpl model .",
    "the result does not differ significantly if we instead use the mcd fit .",
    "then , its identification with the eddington limit leads to a mass estimate as @xmath183 .",
    "the mass could be even higher by a few times , if considering that the highest recorded luminosity reaches @xmath184 erg s@xmath3 , and that the very high state may appear at a luminosity somewhat below the eddington value @xcite .",
    "a possible formation scenario of such an intermediate - mass bh , particularly in close vicinities of galaxy nuclei , has been proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we admit , on the other hand , that the reality of such a cool and thick compton cloud needs a careful consideration , from the viewpoints of its stability , energetics , and geometry with respect to the seed photon source .",
    "these issues are discussed by @xcite .",
    "assuming that the pl state of ulxs is analogous to the very high state of bhbs , we may identify , after some previous works @xcite , the cs state of ulxs to the slim - disk state of bhbs that is observed at their highest luminosities @xcite .",
    "this analogy has the following three grounds .",
    "first , a ulx generally becomes more luminous , by a factor of 1.53 ( in the 110 kev band ) , when it makes a transition from the pl state to the cs state @xcite .",
    "this luminosity relation , including its sense and magnitude , is similar to that observed between the very high state and the slim - disk state of bhbs .",
    "second , the cs - state spectra of ulxs can be generally reproduced successfully by the variable-@xmath106 model with @xmath185 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , when multiple observations of a single cs - state ulx are analyzed by a simple mcd model , we observe the luminosity to scale as @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "the second and third properties agree with the observed behavior of bhbs in their slim - disk state @xcite , as well as predictions by the slim - disk theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in practice",
    ", the above state classification scheme of ulxs can be sometimes rather ambiguous , because a variable-@xmath106 spectrum with a very high disk temperature takes a rather similar shape to a cutoff pl model .",
    "for example , @xcite applied the variable-@xmath106 modeling to several pl - state ulxs observed with xmm - newton .",
    "the present m82 x-1 data are subject to the same ambiguity , because the cutoff pl model and the variable-@xmath106 model have been similarly successful .",
    "in fact , @xcite interpreted an xmm - newton spectrum of this object ( plus some other point sources inclusive ) as arising from an extreme slim disk with a highly super - eddington luminosity , formed around a bh of @xmath187 . even utilizing the broader energy band realized by suzaku",
    ", the degeneracy was not solved , and it remained after removing the source contamination .",
    "let us briefly examine the slim - disk interpretation of the present suzaku data for its consistency .",
    "the variable-@xmath106 fit to the xis plus hxd data gave extremely high disk temperatures as @xmath188 kev ( table  [ tbl : spec_para ] and table  [ tbl : spec_contami_para ] ) , regardless of the treatment of the source contamination .",
    "it significantly exceeds those observed from other pl - state ulxs , including @xmath189 kev from ngc 1313 x-2 at a 0.410 kev luminosity of @xmath190 erg s@xmath3 @xcite , and @xmath191 kev from m81 x-9 at a 0.510 kev luminosity of @xmath192 erg s@xmath3 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature index of m82 x-1 was obtained as @xmath193 in table  [ tbl : spec_para ] , or @xmath194 in table  [ tbl : spec_contami_para ] .",
    "since the latter is consistent with the condition of a standard disk , we may calculate its innermost disk radius @xmath195 via @xmath196 ; here @xmath197 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath198 is a correction factor in @xcite , and the disk inclination is assumed for simplicity as @xmath199 .",
    "taking @xmath200 kev ( table-[tbl : spec_contami_para ] ) and @xmath201 erg s@xmath3 ( section  [ subsec : interpretation ] ) , the above procedure yields @xmath202 km , which corresponds to the last stable orbit of a non - rotating bh with a mass of only @xmath203 .",
    "then , x-1 would be inferred to be shining at 25 - 35 times the eddington luminosity . according to a recent numerical study by @xcite , this mass estimate ( and hence that of the super - eddington factor",
    ") would not differ by more than a factor of 2 , even if the system is in a slim - disk condition .",
    "therefore , we must conclude the source to be in a very deep slim - disk condition .",
    "however , this conclusion is not easily reconciled with the measured values of @xmath106 , which is closer to the standard - disk condition of 0.75 rather than to the limiting slim - disk condition of 0.5 . as far as non - rotating bhs",
    "are considered , we hence regard the slim - disk interpretation as not being self - consistent ; the observed spectrum is simply too hard to be regarded as emission from an optically - thick accretion disk .",
    "if the bh in m82 x-1 is spinning rapidly , its observed properties could be understood more easily in terms of standard accretion disks .",
    "this is because the last stable orbit would be then reduced down to @xmath204 times that of a non - spinning bh of the same mass .",
    "this idea was first proposed by @xcite to explain cs - state spectra of ulxs , and recently applied successfully by @xcite to a transient ulx .",
    "if m82 indeed hosts a maximally rotating bh , the bh mass estimated from the observed @xmath195 would increase to @xmath205 .",
    "however , we are still left with a super - eddington factor of 49 , and have to take into account various relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "therefore , the physical reality of this interpretation is open .",
    "in addition , the reported spectral hardening toward lower fluxes ( of presumably x-1 itself ) , based on the rxte monitoring @xcite , is opposite to the behavior of cs - state ulxs @xcite . from these considerations ,",
    "we regard our baseline interpretation presented in section [ subsec : interpretation ] as more appropriate .",
    "incidentally , the state classification scheme of bhbs employed above is based empirically on the observed _ luminosity _ , but a more physically reasonable scheme should be based on the _ accretion rate normalized to the eddington limit . _ considering that the radiative efficiency itself varies , it is not obvious which of the two states , the very high state and the slim - disk state , correspond to higher normalized accretion rates .",
    "they might even have nearly the same accretion rate , and are controlled by some other parameters including hysteresis effects . in gro  j1655@xmath17340 @xcite , in fact , the system was observed to evolve directly from the standard - disk state into the slim - disk state on one occasion when the luminosity was increasing , while from the slim - disk state to the very high state and then back to the standard - disk state on two occasions during the luminosity descent . a similar hysteresis effect ,",
    "though less clear , is suggested in the case of 4u  1630@xmath17347 @xcite .",
    "clearly , we need deeper understanding of these two high - luminosity states that have been recognized relatively recently .        even with the successful three continuum models found in section  [ subsubsec : joint_fits ] , we observe some data deficits in the @xmath206 kev energy range ( figure  [ fig : spec_xis+pin ] ) . to account for this structure , we multiplied an absorption edge factor to the continuum models fitted to the xis and hxd spectra .",
    "regardless of the choice among the three successful continua , the value of @xmath207 then decreases by @xmath208 for a decrease of degree of freedom by 2 , implying that the edge factor improves the fit with @xmath209 significance .",
    "the edge energy was constrained as @xmath210 kev , which agrees with the k - edge energy of nearly neutral iron .",
    "its optical depth was obtained as @xmath211 , depending on the continuum models and the nxb systematic errors .",
    "the suggested excess fe - k edge could be reconciled with the adopted low - energy absorption ( @xmath212 @xmath4 ) if the iron to alpha - element abundance ratio were 5 to 10 times higher than the solar ratio .",
    "however , this is opposite to the measured abundance pattern of x - ray emitting materials in m82 @xcite , and hence unlikely .",
    "an alternative possibility is that x-1 is in fact rather heavily absorbed by a column up to @xmath213 @xmath4 ( assuming solar ratios ) , but the associated strong low - energy absorption is masked by separate softer components .",
    "yet another possibility is that the spectrum bears a ",
    "reflection \" component from cold materials , and the fe - k edge feature imprinted in that component is being observed . to examine this scenario , we removed the fe - k edge factor from the cutoff pl continuum , and added to it a reflection component , ` pexrav ` @xcite , with the reflector iron abundance fixed at 0.6 solar , those of lighter elements at 1.2 solar @xcite , and the inclination at @xmath214 .",
    "we used the cutoff pl continuum itself as the input to the reflection .",
    "then , the fit chi - squared decreased ( from the original cutoff pl modeling ) by @xmath215 , for a decrease of degree of freedom by 1 .",
    "therefore , the improvement is comparable to that obtained by applying the fe - k edge .",
    "the reflector solid angle @xmath216 , as seen from the nucleus , is suggested to be relatively large as @xmath217 , but with a considerable uncertainty , as the associated compton hump is not well constrained by the hxd data .",
    "we consider this scenario most likely to be the case .",
    "let us also discuss the two fe - k lines detected with the xis ( figure  [ fig : spec_xis ] ) . using chandra and xmm - newton",
    ", @xcite showed that both these lines are associated primarily to diffuse emission , with insignificant contributions from bright point sources including x-1 . over a circular region of radius @xmath218 ( 0.53 kpc ) around the nucleus",
    ", they measured the 6.7 kev and 6.4 kev components to have photon fluxes of @xmath219 ph @xmath4 s@xmath3 and @xmath220 ph @xmath4 s@xmath3 , respectively ( from their table  3 ) .    while our data integration radius ( @xmath1 ) is significantly larger than that of @xcite , diffuse emission in the 28 kev band is mostly contained within the @xmath221 radius ( figure 4f of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the chandra and suzaku results may be directly compared to the first approximation . from our analysis",
    "conducted in section  [ subsubsec : xis_fits ] , the stronger 6.7 kev line has a flux of @xmath222 while the weaker 6.4 kev line @xmath223 , both in units of @xmath224 ph @xmath4 s@xmath3 .",
    "thus , the suzaku and chandra results agree with each other within respective errors .",
    "the observed fe - k line photons are hence attributed primarily to the diffuse component , but some fraction of the 6.4 kev photons may be associated with the putative reflection component of x-1 .    intriguingly , the co - existing 6.4 kev and 6.7 kev fe - k lines have also been detected in the diffuse x - ray emission around our galactic center ( @xcite , and references therein ) and along the galactic ridge @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may be observing a similar phenomenon from the m82 central region .",
    "however , the emission in our galactic center is confined within a considerably narrower region of @xmath225 pc , and its fe - k photon luminosity , as measured with suzaku , is 3 orders of magnitude lower than that from the central region of m82 ( tsuru , nobukawa , and koyama , a private communication ) . presumably , the diffuse emission in m82 is significantly enhanced due to the extreme star - formation activity . further discussion on the iron emission lines is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in addition to the interpretations of ulxs assuming either intermeddate - mass bhs ( section [ subsec : interpretation ] ) or highly super - eddington luminosities ( section [ subsec : interpretation2 ] ) , a third explanation of these sources invokes strong emission anisotropy enhanced toward us ( e.g. , @xcite ) . among such ideas ,",
    "we have already argued in section  [ sebsec : summary ] against the relativistic beaming scenario .",
    "the remaining possibility is geometrical collimation of radiation by a funnel of thick materials @xcite . in such cases",
    ", we should expect strong spectral signatures due to radiation reprocessing , including fe - k edge features and fluorescent fe - k lines , like in some extreme seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , we found the evidence of reflection by nearly neutral materials ( section [ subsec : iron_features ] ) .",
    "however , the observed reprocessor solid angle , @xmath217 , and the equivalent width of the neutral fe - k emission line , @xmath5 ev ( section  [ subsubsec : xis_fits ] ) , are both far smaller than would be expected ( @xmath226 , and an equivalent width of @xmath227 kev ) when the observed radiation is dominated by the reflected component .",
    "furthermore , no adequate explanation based on the collimation scenario has been presented , either for the two types of ulx spectra , or for the transitions between them .",
    "therefore , the anisotropic radiation interpretation is unlikely to give a successful account of the ulx phenomenon in general .",
    "based on our discussion , we conclude that m82 x-1 was in the pl state during the present suzaku observation , and was radiating roughly close to , or slightly below , the eddington luminosity .",
    "this leads to a mass estimate of at least @xmath183 , which is in a good agreement with an independent estimate based on the qpo frequency ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "we therefore consider m82 x-1 as a genuine intermediate - mass bh , in the sense that it is significantly more massive than those bhs that can be explained by the standard stellar evolutionary scenario .",
