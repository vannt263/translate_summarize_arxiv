    "an instance of the _ terrain guarding problem _ contains a terrain @xmath2 that is an @xmath1-monotone polygonal chain .",
    "an @xmath1-monotone chain in @xmath3 is a chain that intersects any vertical line at most once .",
    "the terrain is given by its set of vertices @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "the vertices are ordered such that @xmath6 .",
    "there is an edge connecting each @xmath7 pair where @xmath8 .",
    "we say a point @xmath9 on the terrain _ sees _ another point @xmath10 on the terrain if the line segment @xmath11 is never strictly below the terrain @xmath2 .",
    "a set @xmath0 of points on the terrain is called a _ guarding set _ if every point on the terrain is seen by some point in @xmath0 .",
    "the optimization version of the terrain guarding problem is the problem of finding a minimum guarding set for a given terrain .",
    "there are two standard versions of the terrain guarding problem : a discrete version and a continuous version .",
    "the discrete version allows us to place guards only at the vertices of the terrain .",
    "the continuous version , which we have defined above , allows guards to be placed anywhere on the terrain . in other versions",
    "a subset of points on the terrain to guard is given with the input .",
    "motivation for guarding terrains comes from scenarios that include covering a road with street lights or security cameras .",
    "other applications include finding a configuration for line - of - sight transmission networks for radio broadcasting , cellular telephony and other communication technologies @xcite .",
    "the complexity of terrain guarding has been an open problem of interest since 1995 , when an np - completeness proof was proposed but never completed by chen _",
    "_ @xcite . with the problem s hardness",
    "strongly suspected but not known , a series of approximation algorithms have been developed over the last decade .",
    "the first constant factor approximation for the terrain guarding problem was shown by ben - moshe _ et al .",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "clarkson and varadarajan also give a constant factor approximation in @xcite .",
    "a 4-approximation was proposed by king in @xcite but further analysis increased the approximation factor to 5 .",
    "a 4-approximation was given by elbassioni _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "recently a ptas was given by gibson _",
    "et al . _ in @xcite . with the knowledge that the problem is not apx - complete , it is of even greater interest",
    "whether or not it is np - complete , and this has been reiterated with each approximation algorithm developed .    the terrain guarding problem is closely related to the _ art gallery problem _ that involves guarding the interior of a polygon .",
    "the basic version of the art gallery problem is that of _ vertex guarding _ a simple polygon , where we are given a simple polygon and we wish to find the smallest subset of the vertices that see the entire polygon .",
    "the _ point guarding _ version allows guards to be placed anywhere inside the polygon .",
    "the art gallery problem was shown to be np - complete by lee and lin in @xcite .",
    "along with being np - complete , the art gallery problem was shown to be apx - hard in @xcite .",
    "this means that there exists a constant @xmath12 such that no polynomial time algorithm can guarantee an approximation ratio of @xmath13 unless @xmath14 .",
    "ghosh provides a @xmath15-approximation for the problem of vertex guarding an @xmath16-vertex simple polygon @xcite .",
    "the point guarding problem seems to be much harder than the vertex guarding problem and precious little is known about it @xcite .",
    "a restricted version of the point guarding problem where the polygon is @xmath1-monotone has been shown to have an @xmath17-approximation by nilsson in @xcite . based on his result nilsson also provides a @xmath18 approximation for rectilinear polygons .",
    "straightforward attempts to show np - hardness for the terrain guarding problem run up against the large amount of restriction in the complexity of terrains . by far",
    "the most significant restriction is given by the following claim first noted by ben - moshe _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite :    let @xmath19 be four points on the terrain in increasing order of @xmath1-coordinates . if @xmath20 sees @xmath21 and @xmath22 sees @xmath23 , then @xmath20 sees @xmath23 .",
    "the order claim is crucially exploited by all approximation algorithms for the problem . in this paper",
    "we develop a construction that overcomes the order claim obstacle and shows that the terrain guarding problem is np - hard .",
    "therefore , an exact polynomial time algorithm is not possible unless @xmath24 .",
    "the np - hardness result is shown for the standard discrete and continuous variants of the problem .",
