    "the observation of gravitational microlensing events is becoming established as an important tool in several astrophysical endeavours .",
    "these include the search for extra - solar planets , studies of dark matter , studies of stellar atmospheres , and studies of galactic structure .",
    "more than 500 microlensing events , most of them alerted in real time , have been identified by the microlensing survey groups macho @xcite , ogle @xcite , and eros @xcite .",
    "these groups monitored some millions of stars within their fields of view to find the microlensing events .",
    "the photometry measurements were based on profile fitting software such as dophot @xcite which determines fluxes by integrating over the profile of a given star on a given image .    while profile fitting techniques have proved to be highly successful ,",
    "the limitations of this type of analysis have been recognized for some time .",
    "the most serious limitation is the contamination of flux measurements by the `` blending '' of the profiles of neighbouring stars .",
    "this problem becomes more serious when one encounters crowded regions of stars within the fields of view .",
    "blending causes systematic errors in photometry measurements and subsequent systematic errors in the determination of microlensing parameters such as event duration and peak amplification @xcite .",
    "alard has shown that , using an image subtraction or difference imaging analysis ( hereafter dia ) to allow for the effects of blending , an unbiased reconstruction of the mass function in the galactic bulge should be possible using microlensing data alone .",
    "another problem with profile fitting analyses is that only those microlensing events whose source stars are visible and resolvable at baseline are detected .",
    "microlensing events that rise from below the observational threshold to be visible during times of high magnification are missed .",
    "this is unfortunate , because these events with faint source stars are potentially capable of providing valuable information .",
    "the mere detection of faint stars in the galactic bulge that are normally undetectable can clearly provide useful information . for example , if the magnification is high , spectroscopic information may also be obtained that is not available otherwise ( lennon et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ; minniti et al.1998 ) .",
    "kane and sahu ( 2001 ) recently made a kinematic study of the far side of the galactic bulge using spectroscopy of microlensed sources .",
    "the peaks of high magnification events provide valuable information on extra - solar planetary systems .",
    "griest and safizadeh ( 1998 ) showed that the probability for detecting jupiter - like planets is nearly 100% for events with peak amplifications @xmath3 provided good photometric sampling is carried out around the times of the peaks , and that the probability for detecting earth - like planets is substantial .",
    "they also showed the probability for detecting jupiter - like planets is substantial in events with peak amplifications @xmath1 .",
    "these predictions have been borne out by observation ( rhie et al . 2000 ; albrow et al . 2000 ; bond et al .",
    "as will be shown here , high magnification events can be detected efficiently using dia .",
    "dia largely overcomes the problems caused by blended or undetected microlensing source stars .",
    "recent re - analyses of the macho database using dia have increased the microlensing detection rate and improved the quality of the photometry ( alcock et al . 1999a ; 1999b ; 2000 ) . a re - analysis of the ogle database is underway and similar results are emerging @xcite .",
    "all of these analyses were carried out off - line .    during 2000",
    "we applied dia to observations of the galactic bulge carried out by the moa group .",
    "the analysis was `` real - time '' in that alerts of microlensing events in progress were provided to the microlensing community . in this paper",
    "we describe our implementation of the real - time dia method and present the transient phenomena observed during 2000 .",
    "the observations were carried out using the 60-cm boller & chivens telescope of the mt john university observatory in new zealand .",
    "the telescope was modified by the moa group to provide a 13 field of view at f/6.25 and to enable computer controlled tracking ( abe et al .",
    "the data were taken using the wide field camera , moa - cam2 , that was constructed by the moa group @xcite .",
    "moa - cam2 is a mosaic camera comprised of three abutted thinned 2k@xmath44k site ccd chips .",
    "two wide passbands were employed : a `` blue '' ( 400630 nm ) and a `` red '' ( 6301000 nm ) band .",
    "the wide passbands compensate for the small telescope aperture .",
    "the total field of view over the three ccds is @xmath5 and the pixel size on the sky is @xmath6 .",
    "this is matched to the less than ideal seeing of the set - up which ranges from about @xmath7 to @xmath8 , with the median at about @xmath9 .",
    "these are global figures that include dome seeing , etc .",
    "the observational strategy employed by moa for the galactic bulge in 2000 was somewhat different from that of the established survey groups macho , ogle , and eros . rather than sample a large area of the bulge once per night , we chose to sample a smaller area several times per night .",
    "this decision was taken mainly with the aim of improving our sensitivity to very high magnification events which are expected to rise and fall very rapidly and only be detected above the observation threshold for a few days or less .",
    "for the 2000 observations , a total of 14 moa - cam2  fields towards the galactic bulge were selected on the basis of the distribution of microlensing events detected by the macho collaboration during 19951999 .",
    "these fields cover an area of @xmath10 deg@xmath0 .",
    "the exposure time was 180 seconds per field with most exposures being taken in the red passband .",
    "exposures in the blue passband were only made occasionally and are not used in this study .",
    "this observational strategy allowed a sampling rate for the full 14 fields of up to 6 times per night .",
    "these fields were observed by moa between 2000 march and september .",
    "problems with the camera electronics prevented observations over a six - week period during july  august .",
    "two geometrically aligned images taken under conditions of different seeing are related through the convolution relation    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the better seeing image referred to as the `` reference '' image and @xmath13 is the current `` observation '' image .",
    "the convolution kernel @xmath14 encodes the seeing differences and @xmath15 represents the sky background differences between the two images .",
    "solving for the convolution kernel is the crucial step in image subtraction .",
    "there are two approaches in use for doing this .",
    "one matches point spread function ( psf ) models on the two images by solving for the kernel in fourier space ( phillips & davis 1995 ; tomaney & crotts 1996 ) .",
    "this approach was adopted by alcock et al . in their re - analysis of a subset of the macho data .",
    "the other approach is to directly model the kernel in real space @xcite .",
    "we developed our own implementation of this method .",
    "this includes the modification of alard that models spatial variations of the kernel across the ccd .",
    "the mathematical techniques are described fully by alard & lupton and alard . here",
    "we summarize our implementation .",
    "the convolution kernel function at a given location @xmath16 is expressed as a linear combination of analytical `` basis '' functions    @xmath17    the coefficients in the linear combination are spatially dependent .",
    "they are also modeled as a linear combination of basis functions which takes the form of a two dimensional polynomial    @xmath18    where the polynomial indices @xmath19 and @xmath20 depend implicitly on the function index @xmath21 .",
    "the basis functions used to model the kernel take the form of a combination of two dimensional gaussian functions and polynomials .",
    "the function @xmath22 in eqn .",
    "2 can be expressed in such a way as to render the integral of each but the first basis function zero .",
    "consequently the integral of the kernel itself is constant across the chip regardless of the spatial variations of the kernel .",
    "the differential background is modeled in the same way as the spatial variations in the kernel :    @xmath23    where again the polynomial indices depend implicitly on the function index .",
    "the solution for the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 may be found using standard linear techniques .",
    "the linear system is constructed using a number of sub - regions , referred to as `` stamps '' , centred on bright , but not saturated , stars throughout the image .",
    "an advantage of this method of solution is that these stamps need not be centred on isolated stars with clear point spread functions ( psf stars ) .",
    "there can be any number of stars to any degree of crowding within a stamp .",
    "however , we impose the strict requirement that regions enclosed by the stamps , plus an additional margin given by half the kernel size pixels in this analysis . ] , are completely free of bad pixels including dead columns and bleeding columns due to nearby saturated stars . imposing this condition",
    "greatly improves the robustness in obtaining good quality subtracted images .",
    "another consideration is that the size of the linear system is large when one includes the spatial variations in the convolution kernel .",
    "the computing time required to calculate the linear system can be greatly reduced using an accelerated summation procedure which assumes that the kernel is constant within individual stamps @xcite .",
    "our implementation of the kernel solution method along with the subsequent image subtraction is coded in c. it is worth mentioning here the merits of using an object oriented programming language for this purpose .",
    "24 are somewhat unwieldy to encode in a procedurally oriented language such as fortran or c. the object oriented feature of c  allows one to encapsulate neatly a set of basis functions and their associated polynomial index tables in a single class .",
    "one then declares separate class instances for each set of basis functions describing the kernel , its spatial variations and the differential background .",
    "the psf profiles are known to vary across the field for large ccd images .",
    "consequently , the possible spatial variation of the convolution kernel is an important consideration .",
    "the approach adopted by the macho collaboration was to divide their images into small sub - rasters and solve for the convolution kernel separately on each of these sub - rasters assuming no significant variations in the kernel occurred on their length scales @xcite .",
    "however , for the moa images , we find small but significant spatial variations of the kernel even over small @xmath26 sub - regions of the field .",
    "this prompted us to select the direct kernel modeling method which can easily model these spatial variations .",
    "another consideration which influenced our choice of kernel solution method was that the psf matching method requires high signal - to - noise empirical psf models on both the reference and observation images .",
    "this would be difficult to achieve consistently using a small telescope such as ours at a site with only moderately good seeing .",
    "on the other hand , the direct kernel modeling method only requires the reference image to be of high signal - to - noise .",
    "an example of a subtracted image is shown in fig .",
    "[ diffs ] . the approach taken to subtract a moa 2k@xmath44k observation image from its corresponding reference image involved first selecting suitable stamps on the reference image .",
    "typically @xmath27 stamps were selected per 2k@xmath44k field .",
    "an observation and reference image were then tiled into 1k@xmath41k sub - images which were small enough to allow the spatial variations in the kernel and differential sky background to be satisfactorily modeled using smooth functions .",
    "the solution for the convolution kernel and its associated spatial variations , together with the differential sky backgrounds , was computed for each sub - region .",
    "the corresponding subtracted image was then formed using @xmath28 for a time series of observation images of a given field , a reference image was formed from the best seeing image or a combination of the best seeing images .",
    "the reference image is fixed over the entire time series .",
    "the stamps used for the kernel solution were also fixed for the time series of observations .    a mask image mapping the distribution of saturated stars was also formed from the reference image .",
    "if a particular star contained saturated pixels , the entire star profile was masked out .",
    "there is little useful data that can be obtained at the position of saturated stars .",
    "the mask was applied to all subtracted images to obtain final images .",
    "=      in this work , two distinct modes of analysis were employed .",
    "the `` online '' analysis mode was used for real time reductions the large quantity of 2k@xmath44k images collected during observations .",
    "a more detailed and rigorous `` follow - up '' analysis was then applied to individual events found in the online analysis .",
    "the online analysis system is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ roadmap ] .",
    "the process involves the interplay of a large number of image and numerical datasets .",
    "it is more helpful to regard the system as a data and image management system rather than a linear data reduction `` pipeline '' .",
    "the key features of the analysis system are as follows .",
    "each of the tasks linking the databases shown in fig .",
    "[ roadmap ] is controlled by a single perl script .",
    "these scripts function as wrappers to lower level image and data analysis programs most of which are coded in c. each task can be run individually or combined in other scripts to provide a higher layer of automation .",
    "this design provides considerable flexibility in operation , ranging from complete automation down to image - by - image interaction .      the image registration database provides information on the geometric alignment of observation images to their corresponding astrometric reference images .",
    "the registration process involves cross - referencing resolved stars on the two images to achieve alignment .",
    "each of the 2k@xmath44k observation images was sub - divided into 1k@xmath41k sub - frames .",
    "the brightest 1000 stars within each sub - region were found using our implementation of the algorithm in the iraf task daofind .",
    "the star positions in each sub - frame were cross - referenced with star positions on the corresponding sub - frame of the astrometric reference using a smart algorithm which starts with the pre - supposition that the brighter stars on the observation image will be correspondingly bright on the astrometric reference image .",
    "a slower but very robust alternative algorithm was used as a backup if necessary .",
    "this combination of algorithms provided an extremely robust frame - to - frame matching procedure that worked for all images taken under a variety of viewing conditions . for each observation image",
    "one finally obtained a list of 60008000 cross referenced stars over the full 2k@xmath44k field .",
    "the positions of these stars on the observation and reference images were entered into the registration database .",
    "geometrically aligned images were formed from flat - fielded images using information in the registration database .",
    "the alignment task was controlled by a perl wrapper script for the iraf tasks geomap and geotran .",
    "this alignment process was used in the construction of subtraction reference images and in preparing images for the subtraction process itself .",
    "these databases contain the astrometric and image subtraction reference images for each ccd of each observation field .",
    "the astrometric reference images define the coordinate system to which all observation images were geometrically aligned .",
    "the images used for both astrometry and subtraction were selected from amongst the best seeing , highest signal to noise , and lowest airmass images obtained early in the 2000 galactic bulge observation season.we decided not to form subtraction reference images by combining several images .",
    "instead we chose just one good seeing image per field as the reference .",
    "when combining large images such as ours , there is a danger of corrupting the linearity in the final image due to non - uniformities in the sky background across the chip . in image subtraction ,",
    "it is crucial that the pixel values associated with the images are linear with respect to the incident flux ..      the backbone of the image reduction flow involves processes that generate subtracted images from raw observation images .",
    "intermediate image databases contain flat - fielded and aligned images .",
    "to relieve pressure on computer disk space , raw , flat - fielded , and aligned image databases were flushed periodically .",
    "however , all raw images were externally archived onto dlt tapes .",
    "when required , a given set of flat - fielded and aligned images could easily be regenerated using information in the registration database . on the other hand ,",
    "all subtracted images were retained on disk as these were constantly being accessed by the photometry measurement processes .",
    "the positions of variable stars on a given subtracted image exhibited positive or negative profiles depending on whether the flux had increased or decreased relative to the reference image .",
    "the subtracted images also contained spurious profiles not associated with stellar variability .",
    "one type of spurious profile arose from the effects of differential refraction .",
    "dependent upon the star s colour and the airmass at the time of observation , the position of its centroid was sometimes displaced to a greater extent than other stars .",
    "the result was an imperfect subtraction at the star s position , giving a combined positive and negative profile .",
    "we did not attempt to correct for this effect , but instead filtered out these imperfect subtractions ( see alcock et al .",
    "1999b for a discussion on how to deal with differential refraction ) .",
    "the first step in identifying objects associated with genuine variability was the application of the star finding algorithm described previously to the subtracted image to produce an initial list of variable star positions .",
    "this list was then screened by applying a second algorithm which examined the profile at each position . essentially ,",
    "if the profile contained a large number of either positive definite _ or _ negative definite pixel values , then the profile was deemed to be that of a genuine variable star . for each ccd on each field",
    ", newly detected objects were assigned running numbers according to discovery sequence .",
    "we did not maintain a database of light curves of all resolved stars across the observation fields .",
    "rather , we maintained a database of variable star positions coupled with the database of subtracted images .",
    "light curves were calculated only for objects of `` current interest '' such as newly identified transient events .",
    "the variable star position database was updated periodically as new variables were identified and more refined positions were calculated . since the subtracted images were retained on disk , a light curve at any given set of positions could be easily generated . in the online analysis ,",
    "we extracted photometric measurements from the subtracted images using aperture photometry with an aperture radius of 6 pixels . in the follow - up analysis described in the next section , we used more a precise measurement technique .",
    "we wished to detect new transient events online as opposed to periodic variables such as miras , rr lyrae stars , etc .",
    "a search for new events was generally carried out at the end of each night of good seeing conditions .",
    "for each field , the sequence of subtracted images from the previous night was combined to form a mean subtracted image which was examined for positive and negative profiles due to stellar variability .",
    "the positions of these profiles were cross - referenced with those of variable stars previously detected to produce a list of `` new '' variables .",
    "the variable star database was then updated by appending the new detections .",
    "light curves for the new detections were generated by performing aperture photometry at their respective positions on the entire sequence of subtracted images up to the current observation date .",
    "this practice of periodically carrying out new searches for events rendered the procedure sensitive to short timescale transient events .",
    "the light curves corresponding to all new detections were scrutinized by eye using a graphical tool .",
    "if a particular light curve was clearly characteristic of periodic stellar variability , the associated position was flagged as hosting a `` variable '' star .",
    "on the other hand , if a light curve exhibited behaviour characteristic of a microlensing candidate or other transient event , it was flagged as `` interesting '' .",
    "the interesting events were further scrutinized by examining both the subtracted and unsubtracted images at their respective positions and checking for bad pixels , nearby saturated stars , bleeding columns etc .",
    "interesting events were closely monitored throughout the viewing campaign .",
    "if any event could be clearly identified as a microlensing candidate or another tyoe of interesting transient event , a moa transient alert was issued to the microlensing community and posted on the world wide web .    early in the observation season , the number of light curves to inspect by eye was large but this number decreased rapidly as more and more periodic variables were flagged .",
    "as the observation season progressed , around 100150 previously undetected objects were found each time a search for new events was carried out .",
    "this number of corresponding light curves could easily be scanned by eye and classified .",
    "there is merit in being able to pick up events by eye in real time .",
    "no assumptions on the form of the variability of transient events need be made in the selection process . as well as microlensing events ,",
    "the possibility of detecting new and unusual transient phenomena arises with such a system .",

    "a detailed follow - up analysis was carried out on the events listed in table  [ allevents ] . for a given event ,",
    "400@xmath4400 pixel subframes were extracted from all flat - fielded observation images in the sequences .",
    "an astrometric reference was again selected from amongst the best quality sub - frames and the geometric alignment was repeated . since we were now dealing with small images , we formed the subtraction reference by combining a selection of the very best seeing images .",
    "we required that the geometric alignment images selected in forming the reference involved small offsets from the astrometric reference less than 5 pixels .",
    "this ensured any pixel defects are localised to small regions on the combined image after geometrically aligning the individual images .",

    "this psf was then rescaled to fit the observed flux profile on the subtracted image to provide a measurement of the flux difference .",
    "the associated errors were determined in a self - consistent manner by applying the same measurement technique at the positions of constant stars in the field ( which have flux differences of zero ) .",
    "the scatter in the flux difference measurements for these stars determined the frame - to - frame errors .",
    "difference imaging measures flux differences .",
    "this is a relatively unusual concept in astronomical photometry . to convert `` delta flux '' ( @xmath30 ) measurements onto a magnitude scale",

    "alternatively , one can derive the reference flux by fitting a theoretical profile , such as a microlensing profile , to the observed delta - flux light curve .",
    "there are some situations where it may not be possible to measure the reference flux , and hence the total flux , for a particular event .",
    "for example , the event may be strongly blended with a close bright star making a reference flux measurement impossible .",
    "in such a situation , classical profile fitting photometry will not be able to yield a reliable light curve but difference imaging photometry will at least yield a delta flux light curve with each measurement unaffected by blending .    to obtain information in standard passbands",
