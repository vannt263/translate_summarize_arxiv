    "these composite spectra in the 10001070  region were then compared , and any remaining velocity offsets were removed by referencing the galactic absorption lines to the appropriate local standard of rest velocities .",
    "since we are interested in measuring the fluxes in the cores of saturated lines , accurate determinations of the residual fluxes are essential .",

    "while the exact details of the lsf are presently unknown , such a model more accurately describes the shapes of the cores of the galactic lines toward nearby stars than a single component lsf . as a result , it is possible that some of the observed flux in the line cores is simply redistributed light from nearby continuum regions within @xmath87  of the line .",

    "indeed , the composite spectrum of the 29 lyman break galaxies analyzed by spa shows the clear signature of these outflows : the interstellar absorption - lines are blueshifted by 400 to 500 km s@xmath26 with respect to the @xmath20 emission - line .",
    "this outflow signature is also seen in the composite spectrum formed from the sum of the spectra of 12 lyman break galaxies in the hdf at @xmath93 3 ( lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 ; franx et al .",
    "1997 ) . as noted above",
    ", the relative shallowness of the interstellar lines in both these composite spectra is consistent with ( but does not demand ) a large value for @xmath6 .",
    "similar outflows are seen in the uv spectra of local starbursts ( kunth et al .",
    "1998 ; gonzalez delgado et al . 1998 ) , and heckman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that high - velocity outflows of neutral gas are common in powerful ( @xmath116 10@xmath117 @xmath112 ) local starbursts . in contrast , our @xmath0 data reveal high - velocity ( @xmath118@xmath119 10@xmath107 km s@xmath26 ) outflows in the neutral phase of the ism in only one of our five galaxies : ngc  3310 , in which the mean outflow velocity is about -200 km s@xmath26 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "in the other galaxies the neutral - phase absorption - lines arise in relatively quiescent gas near the galaxy systemic velocity ( figure 1 ; martin et al .",
    "2001 ; heckman et al .",
    "based on the ism dynamics , it is perhaps not surprising that ngc  1705 , ngc  4214 , ngc  5253 , and m  83 are opaque to their lyman continuum radiation .    on the other hand , gonzalez delgado et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that outflows at several hundred km s@xmath26 are present in the neutral gas in at least three of the four starbursts observed below the lyman break by leitherer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in all cases",
    "the galaxy is opaque below the lyman break , with @xmath6 typically @xmath41 3 to 10% . of the three powerful starbursts observed by kunth et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , two ( eso  400-g043 and eso  350-ig038 ) show black interstellar lines and outflows at @xmath120 = -225 and -58 km s@xmath26 respectively . in the third (",
    "iras  08339 + 6517 ) , the lines have a residual intensity of 60 to 70% , and are strongly blueshifted by @xmath16 - 500 km s@xmath26 ( gonzalez delgado et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we conclude that the currently avalilable data do not demonstate that galactic winds inevitably produce large values of @xmath6 in local starbursts .",
    "such outflows appear to be a necessary - but not sufficient - part of the process that creates an ism that is porous to ionizing radiation .    in the near future",
    "we will use @xmath0 to observe a sample of more powerful starbursts ( @xmath121 = 4@xmath1210@xmath122 to 4@xmath1210@xmath117 @xmath112 ) .",
    "this will allow us to probe the lyman continuum opacity in more starbursts with luminosities ( and star formation rates ) that are similar to those of typical lyman break galaxies .",
    "at the same time , the extension of the investigation at high - redshift to a wider range of lyman break galaxies can help clarify the situation",
    ". in particular , it will be important to test the high values for @xmath6 by obtaining data on both the balmer recombination - lines and the lyman continuum in the same set of galaxies ( to provide a consistency check ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath123 mission ( martin et al . 1999 ) will directly measure the escaping flux below the lyman break for the population of star - forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath93 0.4 to 2 ( the epoch that apparently dominates the cosmic history of star - formation ) .",
    "thus , over the next few years , we should be able to make the first good direct measurement of the contribution of star - forming galaxies to the metagalactic ionizing background as a function of cosmic epoch .",
    "this will have important implications for the history of the igm .",
    "we thank the members of the @xmath0 team for providing this superb facility to the astronomical community .",
    "we thank max pettini for enlightening discussions , and for kindly providing us a copy of the composite lyman break galaxy spectrum published by spa .",
