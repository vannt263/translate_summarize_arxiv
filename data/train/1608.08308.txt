    "however , somewhat reminiscent of prethermalization in quantum systems @xcite , we find evidence that the kinetic time scale is much shorter than the actual thermalization time scale on the microscopic level .",
    "insight comes from the fact that the kinetic description conserves the phonon density exactly , besides the energy , whereas on the microscopic level only the energy is expected to be conserved .",
