    "in 1957 rytov @xcite predicted , based on a macroscopic phenomenological theory , that the depolarized light scattering should show a dip at zero frequency . later in the 60 s",
    "it was indeed found experimentally @xcite that the light scattering of a liquid in vh geometry , where the plane of polarization of the incident light and the scattered light are perpendicular to each other , shows a symmetric doublet at @xmath7 1 ghz , with a minimum at zero frequency .",
    "however rytov s theory only showed to be in superficial agreement with the experiments .",
    "in the following time a number of theoretical attempts have been made to understand the spectra .",
    "in general the intensity of the scattered light @xmath8 is proportional to the correlation function of the fluctuations in the components @xmath9 of the total polarizability tensor and to the incident light @xmath10 .",
    "scattering in vh geometry is of particular interest since the direct ( vv or hh ) contributions are dominated by brillouin peaks which correspond to propagating sound waves . in an ideal depolarized spectrum the brillouin lines will be absent and therefore further information of the low frequency dynamics of the system can be obtained .",
    "it is most commonly believed that in molecular liquids , where anisotropic single molecule polarizability fluctuations are the main cause of depolarized spectra , the dip is caused by the coupling of molecular orientations to some part of the stress tensor .",
    "these theories can all be understood in the framework of the mori ",
    "zwanzig projection technique by using different variables for the projection scheme .",
    "some primary variable is picked which couples via a memory kernel to other secondary variables .",
    "until the end of the 70th however the generalized viscosities which occur in the memory kernel where assumed to be time independent .    in 1969",
    "volterra @xcite used the orientations as a primary variable to which the stress tensor couples which he believed to have  due to symmetry reasons  a nonzero matrix element with the total polarizability .",
    "anderson and pecora proposed in 1971 @xcite a theory which used only the symmetric part of the stress tensor as a secondary variable .",
    "keyes and kivelson in 1972 @xcite used the total polarizability as a primary variable and the momentum density as a secondary .",
    "ailawadi et al .",
    "@xcite in 1972 coupled the spin angular momentum density to the asymmetric part of the stress tensor .    at that time it became evident that when reaching towards the supercooled regime additional features occurred e.g. additional site peaks or a central peak which could not be explained consistently by any of the above two variable theories .",
    "therefore a number of theories were developed with additional variables ( and an additional number of adjustable parameters ) .",
    "quentrec in 1976 @xcite used the whole second rank tensor of the orientations and chappell et al . in 1981",
    "@xcite coupled the momentum density and an unspecified symmetric tensor to the total polarizability . and also",
    "a four variable theory with 7 adjustable parameters was proposed @xcite .",
    "wang in 1980 @xcite was the first to introduce time dependent generalized viscosities which can account for retardation effects in the memory functions .",
    "an approach which got refined and improved later on @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite and @xcite emphasize the importance of retardation - ( memory - ) effects in the coupling coefficients between the rotational and translational degrees of freedom .",
    "since all the mentioned theories are phenomenological , it is difficult to decide , which one will give the `` correct '' description of the spectra .",
    "as an important result of our theory , which we are going to present , we will show , how the most complex of the mentioned phenomenological theories @xcite can be derived microscopically as a special approximation to a more complete set of equations .",
    "thereby microscopic expressions for the phenomenological coupling constants in @xcite are presented .",
    "all of the above theories have in common , that they deal with the theory of the experimental technique ( light scattering ) and the dynamic of the system , which is measured in light scattering , on equal footing .",
    "one important deficiency of the early theories , is a too simplistic treatment for the dynamic of the liquid ( e.g. assuming white noise spectra for the in general frequency dependent generalized viscosities @xcite ) , although the phenomenology for the light scattering part is correct . from a conceptual point of view",
    ", a clear distinction between these two topics should be made .",
    "the question which quantity is measured , can and should be answered first . in a second , and we would like to stress , _ independent _ step , a theory for the measured quantity can be formulated .",
    "this strategy was already pursued in the generalized hydrodynamic approach of @xcite , where - without specifying the scattering mechanism - a completely general treatment of the effect of hydrodynamic singularities and the influence of slow structural relaxations on light scattering spectra was achieved , by deriving formally exact expressions for frequency dependent pockels constants and related green kubo relations .",
    "also in our approach the two mentioned questions are clearly separated .",
    "but contrary to @xcite , we will formulate a theory for a specific scattering mechanism , to get some more insight in the microscopic mechanisms .",
    "we will show in section [ sec : other ] , that the formal structure of the theory is compatible with @xcite .",
    "first we will derive the quantities , which are measured in an ideal light scattering experiments at linear molecules , where all interaction induced effects can be neglected .",
    "then , we present a set of microscopic equations , which in principal enable us to calculate these quantities for a supercooled liquid close to the glass transition . in a final step",
    "we approximate our equations very drastically , keeping only the necessary ingredients for a qualitatively correct description of the light scattering experiments .",
    "this step is only for pedagogical reasons , to demonstrate the ability of the theory to reproduce light scattering spectra close to the glass transition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : sec3 ] we derive the direct contribution to the light scattering spectrum of a liquid of linear molecules .",
    "it will provide the starting point for the following theoretical considerations .",
    "in section [ sec : mmct ] we present a straight forward generalization of the molecular mode coupling theory @xcite for linear molecules , which in addition to the orientational and translational degrees of freedom also describes the coupling to transversal current fluctuations . in section",
    "[ sec : glasd ] we formulate a restricted _ not _ self consistent theory , which still contains all hydrodynamic modes and the most important rotational degrees of freedom . as a further , very drastic approximation",
    ", we set up a simple maxwell theory to demonstrate that all qualitative features , observed in light scattering experiments in supercooled liquids are reproduced already within the restricted theory , by changing only the time scale of the structural relaxation . in section",
    "[ sec : other ] the relation to other light scattering theories is discussed .",
    "the phenomenological equations of @xcite are derived within our theory and shown to be a special case of the restricted theory .",
    "following @xcite the total polarizability of a molecular liquid can be expressed as a sum of single particle and interaction induced many particle contributions .",
    "@xmath11 where the superscript @xmath12 denotes the external electric field and @xmath13 denotes an effective internal field . in this work we are concentrating on the direct contribution for linear molecules only . in a dense liquid other scattering mechanisms like",
    "direct and indirect dipole induced dipole scattering mechanism and collision induced scattering mechanisms are also present , in general . for cs@xmath14 e.g. it has been argued by madden and tildesley @xcite that the interaction induced mechanism is the dominant one ( although this result has been questioned @xcite ) . for salol",
    "it was found @xcite , that the depolarized light scattering is dominated by scattering at orientational fluctuations . in @xcite",
    "more examples are discussed . a theory for depolarized did spectra in simple liquids",
    "was presented in @xcite .",
    "a generalization of this work to a hydrodynamic theory of of light scattering , which incorporates in principle all possible scattering mechanisms was developed in @xcite .",
    "here we want to concentrate on the molecular origin of the depolarized light scattering for a system of linear molecules .",
    "a generalization to non linear molecules is straight forward , but to avoid unnecessary complexity , we want to restrict ourselves to linear molecules .",
    "the numerical study of water @xcite has shown , that even the dynamics of this non linear molecule can be reasonably well reproduced by modeling it as as a linear molecule . only direct contribution of the orientations to the spectra are discussed .",
    "all interaction induced contributions are neglected .    for linear molecules the polarization tensor of a single molecule",
    "can be written in the form    @xmath15    here @xmath16 is a unit vector in the direction of the principal axis of the molecule @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the identity matrix .",
    "the numbers @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the mean polarizability and the anisotropy of the polarization respectively .",
    "the collective wave - vector dependent fluctuations of the total polarizability tensor @xmath21 are defined by @xmath22 here the indices @xmath23 , @xmath24 denote the direction of the scattered and incident light , respectively .",
    "the fluctuation of the single molecule polarizability @xmath25 is completely due to rotations of the molecule .",
    "the light scattering intensity is then given by @xmath26 where the @xmath27 brackets denote a thermal expectation value . usually the convention is used that the xz - plane is the scattering plane and the scattering vector is anti - parallel to the z - axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] ) . in this geometry",
    "the depolarized scattering in vv and vh geometry , respectively , read : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the scattering angle , @xmath30 and @xmath31 denotes the fourier transform . for linear molecules ,",
    "the specified scattering frame is equivalent to the so called @xmath32 -frame , where the z - axis is parallel to the scattering vector @xmath33 , since the polarizability tensor is a spherical tensor of rank two , where only @xmath1 and @xmath2 components appear ( see appendix [ app : a ] ) .",
    "these are invariant under reflection @xmath34 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath35 in the @xmath32 - frame is derived in appendix [ app : a ] . with ( [ eq : polmat ] )",
    "we arrive at the result @xmath36 in the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vv ] ) and ( [ eq : hv ] ) we used that in the q -frame , the dynamic structure factors @xmath37 are diagonal with respect to @xmath38 and that for linear molecules @xmath39 .",
    "the contribution @xmath40 can be neglected for light scattering experiments , since it is of relative order @xmath41 , compared to @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "similar equations were already derived in @xcite for the special case of a diluted gas , where translational and rotational motion can be factorized . in the case of dense liquids , the form eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vv ] ) and ( [ eq : hv ] ) have to be used .",
    "for a system of linear molecules with only direct but anisotropic scattering mechanism , they provide a complete and exact description of the observed light scattering spectra .",
    "since we are interested in light scattering experiments in supercooled liquids , we are going to present a microscopic theory for the generalized dynamic structure factors @xmath44 which contains all observed features of light scattering experiments close to the glass transition . already from the general form of ( [ eq : vv ] ) and ( [ eq : hv ] ) some general conclusions can be drawn .",
    "first , due to the scattering angle @xmath29 in the vh geometry a backscattering geometry only observes the @xmath45 component of the dynamic density correlation function whereas a 90 degree scattering angle probes a mixture of @xmath5 and @xmath45 components . in the following sections we show that the @xmath46 and @xmath47 component couple to the longitudinal and transverse sound mode , respectively , while the @xmath48 component does not couple to any hydrodynamic mode",
    ". therefore it is possible to replace @xmath48 by its value at @xmath49 , but not the correlators with @xmath50 .",
    "the different behavior of the correlators with different m is due to a dynamic breaking of the rotational invariance on the spatial scale of the light scattering experiments , caused by the existence of hydrodynamic singularities .",
    "the phenomenological form for the light scattering spectra used in the literature can be recovered by rewriting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vv ] ) and ( [ eq : hv ] ) in the form @xmath51 here we have used that for @xmath49 due to rotational symmetry all correlation functions with different helicity @xmath4 but the same @xmath3 are equal and are therefore replaced with @xmath52 .",
    "in addition we have neglected the off diagonal contribution @xmath53 .",
    "the last two terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vv_phen ] ) and ( [ eq : hv_phen ] ) contain hydrodynamic poles and thus essential for the understanding of light scattering experiments . for theoretical considerations",
    "it is more convenient to use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vv ] ) and ( [ eq : hv ] )",
    ". therefore we continue in this work using the representation in spherical harmonics .",
    "second , the spectra fulfill sum rules .",
    "the total intensities @xmath54 for @xmath55 are derived from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vv ] ) and ( [ eq : hv ] ) @xmath56 here we used , that the static structure factor @xmath57 are independent of @xmath4 and diagonal in @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the anisotropic part of @xmath59 is exactly equal to @xmath60 .",
    "third , we note the well established fact , that the often used procedure to obtain the isotropic scattering contribution ( e.g. in @xcite , see also @xcite ) by simply subtracting @xmath61 from @xmath62 is in general not exact , since there are big qualitative differences between the correlation functions @xmath63 for different @xmath4 , due to the coupling of translational and rotational motion . in appendix 7b of @xcite the mentioned relation between @xmath62 and @xmath64",
    "could be derived by explicitly assuming , that rotational and translational motion are independent .",
    "but it is clear , that this can not hold in dense liquids , where the rotation of a molecule can easily cause the build up of local stress via interaction with its neighbors .",
    "this stress can then be released by a center of mass motion of neighboring molecules .",
    "instead of obtaining only the isotropic contribution the mentioned subtraction method will yield the following expression .",
    "@xmath65 eq . ( [ eq : subtract ] ) shows , that even in back scattering geometry deviations from the purely isotropic scattering are to be expected . to demonstrate this point in more detail , we plot in figure [ fig : dep ] the value of the depolarization ratio in backscattering geometry ( @xmath66 ) for a simple model which we derive from our equations ( see section [ sec : glasd ] ) . to further demonstrate the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : depref ] ) we have ( using the same model discussed in section [ sec : glasd ] ) further plotted the quantity @xmath67 .",
    "this is done on a linear frequency scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : refrep ] and on a logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : refantwlog ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen that deep in the liquid phase ( @xmath68 ) it is practically zero whereas strong deviations occur esspecially around the brillouin lines when supercooling the liquid . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vv_phen ] ) and ( [ eq : hv_phen ] ) it follows that the depolarization ratio in general is given by @xmath69 in backscattering geometry ( @xmath70 ) it is nearly constant in the liquid and given by @xmath71 whereas strong deviations occur around the brillouin line when super - cooling the liquid .",
    "these deviations are expected to be even bigger when the experiment is performed not in backscattering geometry since in this case the @xmath5 component which couples to the transverse phonon will also contribute .",
    "[ fig : deplog ] shows the depolarization ratio on a logarithmic frequency scale .",
    "the deviations of the depolarization ratio from @xmath71 are also seen in the experiment and are discussed in @xcite .",
    "therefore we have proven that the quantity @xmath72 is _ not _ proportional to @xmath73 , especially not around the brillouin lines .",
    "we are aware that this is a severe difficulty in interpreting light ",
    "scattering experiments and want to point out that in the low frequency regime it is usually not applied anyways since @xmath74 becomes very weak .",
    "after having an exact expression for the scattered intensities ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vv ] ) and ( [ eq : hv ] ) ) , we turn in this section to the second and independent step in order to arrive at a microscopic understanding of light scattering spectra .",
    "this second step is the discussion of a microscopic theory of a molecular liquid .",
    "the mode coupling theory of the glass transition has by now proven to be a very successful microscopic theory to describe the dynamics of supercooled liquids close to the glass transition ( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite ) . in its early version @xcite only simple liquids consisting of spherical molecules were described microscopically . due to its successful application also to experiments and simulations at arbitrary molecules",
    "it became necessary to develop generalizations to molecular liquids @xcite .",
    "also aspects of these generalized theories were successfully tested in simulations @xcite .",
    "the main quantity , which is studied in @xcite is the coherent dynamic structure factor @xmath44 for linear molecules .",
    "the theory describes on a microscopic basis the coupling of translational and orientational degrees of freedom , but does not take into account the coupling to transversal currents . in @xcite the theory for the dynamic structure factor @xmath75 of arbitrary rigid molecules was derived .",
    "this theory deals also with the transversal currents , but is at present difficult to reduce to linear molecules .",
    "since all theories of light scattering agree in the importance of transversal current fluctuations , it will be necessary to formulate a theory for linear molecules , which also contains coupling to transversal currents .",
    "fortunately this theory is a straight forward generalization of the theory in @xcite .",
    "we do not take into account energy fluctuations in our derivation , which were necessary to describe the rayleigh peak i.e. the influence of heat diffusion on the light scattering spectrum .",
    "we do not expect important changes for the discussion of the light scattering spectrum , by neglecting the influence of heat fluctuations . for a discussion of the interplay of structural relaxation and heat diffusion see @xcite .",

    "@xmath77 with @xmath78 being the spherical harmonics and tensorial currents @xmath79 . the index @xmath80 denote translational currents and rotational currents , respectively . for linear molecules",
    "it is not necessary to use the orientational current as a vectorial quantity .",
    "the only quantity which will appear in the theory is @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the angular momentum operator and @xmath83 is the angular velocity .",
    "@xmath84 with @xmath85 are the components of an irreducible spherical tensor of rank @xmath3 .    to be able to describe light scattering spectra we will need all components of the translational current fluctuations @xmath86 , @xmath87 , not only its projection along @xmath33 as in @xcite .",
    "here we used spherical components @xmath88 instead of cartesian components @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90    with @xmath91 the translational currents @xmath86 can be written as a sum of components of an irreducible spherical tensor @xmath92 @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , due to the properties of the clebsch gordan coefficients @xmath96 . as an important special case we note , that the transversal center of mass currents @xmath97 have irreducible spherical components @xmath98 .",
    "the currents and the densities fulfill a continuity equation @xmath99 with @xmath100    with the help of mori - zwanzig projection operator techniques @xcite , it is possible to derive a formally exact set of equations for the correlation functions @xmath101 of the tensorial densities @xmath76 . for simplicity we write the equation in the @xmath32 - frame i.e. ( @xmath102 ) . for a short ranged potential every correlation function @xmath103 of two components @xmath104 of irreducible spherical tensors",
    "fulfill the relations @xmath105 the first line or ( [ diag ] ) is just due to the fact that under a rotation around the z - axis , @xmath106 will transform into @xmath107 .",
    "since the correlation function has to be invariant under this operation , the relation ( [ diag ] ) follows .",
    "the second line is a consequence of global rotational invariance of the system of linear molecules .",
    "in addition , the correlation function @xmath108 is independent of @xmath4 for @xmath49 , if there are no long range correlations , which destroy the global rotational invariance . for correlation functions which behave regular at @xmath49 i.e. which do not contain any hydrodynamic poles , we are allowed to replace them for small @xmath32 by their value at @xmath49 plus corrections .",
    "if there are hydrodynamic poles , the differences between different @xmath4 can be crucial e.g. we will see , that the dynamic correlation function @xmath109 contains for @xmath5 even at small values of q couplings to transversal current fluctuations , where the one for @xmath45 behaves regular at @xmath110 .",
    "the dynamic correlation function @xmath37 is a real quantity @xcite .",
    "since we will discuss in the following part of the paper also current  current correlation functions we use the notation @xmath111 the equation for @xmath112 is therefore @xmath113 where we use the short  hand notation @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the current  density , density  current and current  current correlation functions , respectively .",

    "instead , due to ( [ pm1 ] ) and ( [ diag ] ) the relation @xmath132 has to be fulfilled : @xmath133    without the memory matrix equation , ( [ eq : mctanf ] ) would describe a system of coupled undamped harmonic `` modes '' , where the modes are in this case correlation functions of tensorial densities .",

    "the function @xmath391 can also be expressed in terms of a ( modified ) reduced time propagator @xmath392 , @xmath393 .",
    "in addition , the equation for @xmath385 were of first order in time instead of second order .",
    "wang uses a mixed representation @xcite .",
    "his constitutive equation for the stress tensor coincides with eq .",
    "( [ eq : other2 ] ) , but the equation for @xmath390 is only of first order . for deriving exactly such a set of equations , it were necessary to use different projection operators for deriving the constitutive equation and the equation for the tensor @xmath394 .",
    "from our point of view there are mainly two reasons why it seems more advantageous to choose one single set of basis variables including the currents @xmath388 .",
    "first , since approximation schemes for force - force autocorrelation functions i.e. the memory - function @xmath395 seem to be easier , than for mixed current - force memory - functions , which would appear , when only the densities @xmath76 and the conserved currents @xmath396 were used as variables .",
    "second , by using one set of variables the onsager relations are automatically fulfilled , since there appears the same function @xmath383 in the equation for the stress and the tensor @xmath385 . in the approach of wang",
    "it is important to choose the approximations for the different functions @xmath391 and @xmath383 carefully , such that the onsager principle is guaranteed .",
    "( essentially the time derivative of @xmath391 is related to @xmath383 . )",
    "the approach of @xcite is more general than ours , since no assumptions on the scattering mechanisms were used to derive the general form of light scattering spectra of supercooled liquids .",
    "this was achieved by only using the hydrodynamic variables center of mass density and center of mass currents as the basic set of variables for applying constitutive equations to the dielectric tensor fluctuations . in this way",
    "the coupling mechanisms between rotation and translations in molecular liquids are not explicitly treated but lead implicitly to frequency dependent pockels constants , relating the hydrodynamic modes to the dielectric tensor fluctuations , and unknown background spectra . due to the general nature of the approach in principle also other mechanisms",
    "like did are contained on a formal level in the description , although they can not be explicitly treated without using a specific theory .",
    "in our approach we concentrated on a specific mechanism for the coupling of light to the motion of the linear molecules , by assuming that the principal axis of the polarizability tensor agree with the principal axis of the inertia tensor of the molecule . under this assumption eq .",
    "( [ eq : vv ] ) and ( [ eq : hv ] ) are completely general .",
    "the importance of the index of helicity @xmath4 seems to be at variance with the approach of @xcite , since there only @xmath52 components appear .",
    "but if we express @xmath397 by correlation functions of the hydrodynamic variables plus a background spectra with the help of the exact generalized constitutive relations as used above we obtain in the @xmath32 - frame for @xmath398    @xmath399    here the reduced resolvent @xmath400 describes the dynamic perpendicular to the hydrodynamic fluctuations only i.e. the subscript @xmath401 indicates , that the projection operator @xmath127 , used in eq .",
    "( [ hydroform ] ) projects on the space of non hydrodynamic variables . transforming @xmath360 to irreducible spherical components , the @xmath402 spectrum ( [ eq : hv ] )",
    "can be written @xmath403 where the background spectrum @xmath404 and the generalized pockels constant @xmath405 are given by @xmath406    in leading order in q ( i.e. @xmath407 ) we are now allowed to replace the reduced resolvent in eq .",
    "( [ pockels ] ) with the full resolvent @xcite .",
    "similar equations can be derived for the @xmath263 spectrum .",
    "( [ frano ] ) is exactly the form found in @xcite .",
    "the explicit @xmath4 dependence is not present anymore in ( [ frano ] ) , since we used that at @xmath49 correlation functions between fluctuations with the same @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which do not contain hydrodynamic poles , do not depend on @xmath4 anymore .",
    "but it is important to note , that the dynamic coupling to the transversal current fluctuations is not vanishing , only due to the existence of an irreducible @xmath5 component of the stress tensor .",
    "also in @xcite this symmetry was implicitly used .",
    "but after using it , the reduced matrix element @xmath408 can be replaced by the one for @xmath52 at @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ hydroform ] ) .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence is replaced by an explicit dependence on the transversal current spectrum , which is only present due to the coupling of @xmath304 to the transversal current fluctuations .",
    "we could now further proceed and express the background spectrum and the pockels constant with the method , explained in the appendices [ sec : proj ] - [ appendixa ] , by the correlation functions and memory functions , which we used in sections [ sec : mmct ] and [ sec : glasd ] .",
    "but since we have to evaluate the center of mass current correlation functions and the center of mass density correlation function at small but finite values of q ( for example to be able to understand the renormalization of the transversal sound waves by rotation translation coupling ) , we would arrive at exactly the same theory , which we already derived in the mentioned sections .",
    "the merit of the approach of @xcite is to work out the most general form of light scattering spectra using only generalized hydrodynamic and generalized constitutive equations for dielectric fluctuations .",
    "thus rigorous constraints concerning the appearance of hydrodynamic excitations in different scattering geometries are formulated . for explicit considerations of specific scattering mechanisms , as done in this paper , one has in general to include also non hydrodynamic variables .",
    "in this work we developed a microscopic theory of light scattering for linear molecules , concentrating on the direct contribution to the spectra .",
    "the starting point of our theory is an exact expression for the spectra in terms of correlation functions ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vv ] ) and ( [ eq : hv ] ) ) .",
    "it turns out to be important to accurately take the tensorial character of the orientational correlation function into account .",
    "this is due to the fact that the orientational components of different helicity index @xmath4 transform in general differently under rotations .",
    "it is in this context crucial , that the dynamic correlation functions @xmath339 ( contrary to the memory functions ) have to be evaluated at small but _ finite _ wave vectors due to the following reason .",
    "the rotational symmetry allows for the dynamic coupling of @xmath52 components of tensorial densities @xmath409 and rotational currents to the longitudinal and the @xmath5 components of tensorial densities @xmath409 and rotational currents to transversal current fluctuations , respectively .",
    "microscopically the coupling is non vanishing due to the induction of local stress by the rotation of the molecules .",
    "therefore the hydrodynamic poles show up in the corresponding dynamic correlation function @xmath339 .",
    "thus we are not allowed to replace them by there value at @xmath49 , where indeed correlation functions for different values of @xmath4 , but the same @xmath3 , are equal .",
    "only the @xmath45 component of @xmath339 which does not couple to any hydrodynamic mode and all memory functions , which  due to our choice of dynamic variables  do not contain by construction any hydrodynamic pole , can be replaced by its value at @xmath49 .",
    "it is the violation of rotational symmetry on the spatial scale of the light scattering experiments due to the existence of hydrodynamic modes , which causes the importance of the helicity index @xmath4 .",
    "based on a projection operator formalism , we formulate a microscopic theory for the correlation functions @xmath410 of supercooled molecular liquids , which include all possible couplings to hydrodynamic modes . simplifying the equations of the molecular mode coupling theory extended by transverse currents , we demonstrate explicitly , that a qualitative description for light scattering spectra near the glass transition can be achieved , which treats correctly the interplay of hydrodynamic modes and structural relaxations .",
    "we further derive microscopic expressions which give the influence of the rotation  translation coupling onto the hydrodynamic poles .",
    "it is also shown how other theories of light scattering can be expressed by the quantities , which appear in our theory .    the equations ( [ eq : vv ] ) and ( [ eq : hv ] ) are in principle not restricted to small q - values .",
    "they are therefore also valid for the interpretation of x - ray spectra , if we give up the restriction to small wave vectors .",
    "since the mmct , formulated in our paper is a theory for all wave vectors , there will be no principal problems to do this .",
    "a possible application of the restricted theory in [ sec : glasd ] , would be to compare spectra of different scattering angles and of different scattering geometries in order to obtain microscopically relevant quantities like e.g. the rotation  translation coupling .",
    "but to obtain reliable results , it is of course necessary to give up the maxwell ansatz and to include @xmath206 relaxation phenomena in the memory functions .",
    "further we like to encourage the evaluation of the orientational components for different @xmath4 values from computer simulations .",
    "we thank r. schilling , m. fuchs , h.  z.  cummins and r.  pick for a critical reading of the manuscript and for helpful comments .",
    "our work was financially supported from the sfb 262 .",
    "to demonstrate how theories of light - scattering , based on various projection operator formalism can in principal be expressed by the correlation functions appearing in molecular mct , we take as an example the set of variables from the book of berne and pecora @xcite and show how their memory functions can be evaluated using the basis set of molecular mct .",
    "we use the projection operator formalism in laplace transformed space ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to explain the appearance of a rytov dip , in @xcite the polarizability and one component of the transverse current @xmath411 with @xmath412",
    "are chosen as a minimal basis set .",
    "@xmath413 is the complex frequency .",
    "we have shown in section [ sec : sec3 ] that the polarizability for the depolarized light scattering is in the subspace of the l=2 density .",
    "therefore we define @xmath414 . applying mori  zwanzig projection technique with a projection operator @xmath415 , the dynamics of the polarizability correlation function for the depolarized light scattering results from a solution of the following 2x2 matrix equation : @xmath416 which is still exact .",
    "@xmath126 is the liouvillian and @xmath417 is the reduced dynamics and @xmath418 is the static correlation function .",
    "the occurrence of a dip in the spectrum relies on the fact that the off diagonal element @xmath419 does not vanish for small but finite wave - vector @xmath32 .",
    "it follows from momentum conservation , that it is of order @xmath32 .",
    "it is therefore possible to define an effective coupling constant @xmath420 between transversal current fluctuations and polarizability fluctuations due to the rotation of the molecule ( see ref .",
