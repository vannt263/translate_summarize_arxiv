    "the classical ` baldwin effect ' is an anti - correlation between the rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of a broad - emission line region ( belr ) line and quasar luminosity , first observed for the @xmath0 line @xcite .",
    "this anti - correlation is stronger and steeper for belr lines with higher ionization potentials ( @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it involves substantial scatter , hampering its use as a cosmological probe @xcite . considerable effort has been invested in attempts to minimize this scatter , using partial - correlation and principal - component analyses involving emission - line as well as broad - band spectroscopic data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the exact cause of the baldwin effect remains elusive . a dependence on the shape of the continuum - source spectral energy distribution ( sed ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cosmic evolution @xcite , or the supermassive black - hole mass ( @xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) being the primary physical driver for the ew - luminosity anti - correlation are among the explanations proposed for this effect .",
    "it had also been speculated that the baldwin effect depends largely on the normalized accretion rate , in terms of the eddington ratio , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the bolometric luminosity and @xmath11 is the eddington luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using the empirical belr size - luminosity relation @xcite and assuming the belr gas is virialized , @xmath8  takes a general expression of the form @xmath8@xmath12 ; the eddington ratio can therefore be expressed as @xmath9@xmath13 , where @xmath14 and fwhm typically correspond to the monochromatic luminosity at rest - frame 5100  and the full width at half maximum intensity of the broad h@xmath1  from high - ionization belr lines , such as c  iv , may yield unreliable results , since the line profiles are complicated by a non - virial ( i.e. , ` wind ' ) component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter bl04 ) found a significant anti - correlation between ew ( ) and h@xmath1-based @xmath9 ; they did not find a significant correlation between ew ( ) and monochromatic luminosity at rest - frame 3000 .",
    "bl04 argued that most of the scatter in the classical baldwin effect is produced by a range of @xmath9  at a given @xmath10 , driven by a range in fwhm(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "this scatter is minimized considerably when a combination of fwhm(h@xmath1 ) and luminosity , i.e. , the eddington ratio , is employed , thus strengthening the anti - correlation with ew ( ) .",
    "bl04 claimed that the classical baldwin effect is only a secondary effect since , typically , more luminous quasars also have higher eddington ratios .",
    "@xcite report a similar result for the ew of the  @xmath15 doublet using -based @xmath9  determinations for a sample of 2092 active galactic nuclei at @xmath16 , suggesting that the baldwin effect is governed by @xmath9 .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the bl04 analysis by including quasars with ergs@xmath4 at that have h@xmath1  spectral information from near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy as well as information from optical spectroscopy in order to test whether the anti - correlation , hereafter the modified baldwin effect ( mbe ) , remains strong across the widest possible ranges of redshift , luminosity , and @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , the extension of this relationship to higher redshifts and luminosities is required in order to test the hypothesis that the extreme weakness of the lines in weak emission line quasars ( wlqs ) , that typically have ew()@xmath17  ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , is due to extremely high accretion rates in these sources ( see , e.g. , @xcitea ; @xcite , 2010 ) . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we describe the properties and spectroscopic measurements of our quasar sample , including wlqs , and in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of a correlation analysis involving ew ( ) , monochromatic luminosity , and @xmath9 . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",

    "the exclusion of rlqs and bal quasars is intended to minimize potential effects of continuum boosting and absorption biases ( e.g. , bl04 ) , respectively , that may result in systematic underestimations of ew ( ) .",

    "the two gaussian profiles are used for least - squares fitting purposes only and thus are not intended to represent two physically distinct emission regions .",

    "the ew of the line in each source has been computed using the sum of the fluxes in each best - fit gaussian profile and the best - fit linear continuum underlying the emission line .",

    "we account for this potential intrinsic scatter by using the bivariate correlated errors and scatter method ( bces ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for performing the linear regression .",
    "since a derivation of the eddington ratio involves a typical uncertainty of @xmath96 dex , we assign to all the @xmath92  ( @xmath9 ) values of the bl04 and hiz samples homoscedastic errors of 0.3  dex ( cf .",

    "we cross - checked the above bces bisector relation against the results from a linear - regression analysis using the maximum - likelihood estimate method of @xcite .",
    "this method results in a flatter slope ( -0.41@xmath390.08 ) and a roughly similar intercept ( 1.44@xmath390.04 ) , but the slope is highly sensitive to the uncertainties assumed on @xmath92  ( @xmath9 ) in the sense that the best - fit relation steepens as the errors increase beyond 0.3  dex .",
    "we adopt the more conservative bces bisector relation since , as shown below , this provides more stringent constraints on the wlq sample .    in fig .",

    "in this work , we expanded the bl04 parameter space by including sources having the highest possible redshifts and luminosities , for which high - quality spectral information for and h@xmath1  is available , in order to test whether the relative strength of depends primarily on @xmath9 .",
    "we find that , for ordinary quasars across the 10@xmath105@xmath67@xmath2710@xmath106ergs@xmath4 and 0.01@xmath91 ranges , the scatter in the baldwin effect is minimized when @xmath9  replaces monochromatic luminosity , thus extending the ew()-@xmath9  anti - correlation from bl04 , i.e. , the mbe , by almost two orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "however , we also find no significant correlations between ew ( ) and either @xmath67@xmath27 or @xmath9  when only high - redshift and high - luminosity sources are considered ; this is mainly a consequence of additional scatter introduced by using diverse data sets and the strong dependence between @xmath67@xmath27 and @xmath9  at high redshift .",
    "we also investigate how wlqs fit into this picture and whether they have exceptionally high eddington ratios .",
    "we find that , in general , the h@xmath1-based eddington ratios of wlqs are within the norm when compared to ordinary quasars with similar redshifts and luminosities ( see , e.g. , tables  [ tab : hizdata ]  and  [ tab : wlqdata ] ) , and that most wlqs deviate considerably from the ew()-@xmath9  anti - correlation , suggesting that the mbe may not be applicable to all quasars .",
    "if the strong deviation of these wlqs is due to selection effects , then low-@xmath9  sources with are required in order to cause the necessary steepening in the mbe for accommodating additional wlqs .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether the emerging population of high - ew ( ) quasars at high redshift would produce such an effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that most wlqs do not follow the mbe may , instead , bring into question the reliability of determining @xmath8  values in wlqs and perhaps in ordinary quasars as well .",
    "our linear regression analysis already indicates a trend of a steeper best - fit ew()-@xmath9  relation as the assumed uncertainties on @xmath9  increase .",
    "such a steepening may accommodate some , but perhaps not all , wlqs in the mbe .",
    "the standard , single - epoch h@xmath1-method for obtaining @xmath8  and @xmath9 , briefly outlined in section  [ sec : introduction ] and given in equation  [ eq : eddington ] , respectively , is likely too simplistic , and may involve uncertainties much larger than 0.3  dex ( as we assume in section  [ sec : results ] ) as well as systematic uncertainties .",
    "one such systematic uncertainty may be a consequence of orientation bias ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario , sources viewed close to pole - on exhibit narrower belr lines , and thus their actual @xmath8  ( @xmath9 ) values should be higher ( lower ) . if wlqs suffer from orientation bias , then their eddington ratios should be even smaller than those in table  [ tab : wlqdata ] , resulting in a larger deviation from the mbe .",
    "orientation bias is , therefore , an unlikely explanation for this deviation . a different method of determining eddington ratios in wlqs is required to test whether these ratios are considerably larger than the respective h@xmath1-based values .",
    "the hard-  photon index ( @xmath107 ) is one such @xmath9  indicator that can be used for cross - checking with h@xmath1-based values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to this end , such a comparison has been made for two wlqs , phl  1811 and sdss  j1141@xmath220219 ; for both sources the -based @xmath9  value is consistent with the h@xmath1-based value ( see , @xciteb and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "based on equation  [ eq : bces ] , wlqs are expected to have @xmath94 , which would render extremely steep hard-  spectra with @xmath108 @xcite .",

    ", the classical baldwin effect @xcite , observed for high - redshift quasars ( for practical reasons ) , included substantial scatter which , as we explain in section  [ sec : results ] , could not have been effectively minimized by replacing the luminosity with the eddington ratio .",
    "mainly low - luminosity sources with high eddington ratios , e.g. , narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) , led bl04 to conclude that @xmath9  is the primary physical parameter governing the relative strength of .",
    "nls1s deviate considerably from the classical baldwin effect , but are accommodated by the mbe . in this work",
    ", we show that most of our wlqs deviate considerably from the mbe ( and from the classical baldwin effect ) , revealing that the relative strength of may not depend solely on @xmath9  for all quasars . in this respect ,",
    "wlqs are analogous to nls1s by calling for more scrutiny into the parameters controlling belr line strengths in quasars .",
    "bl04 explored additional observables that may further reduce the scatter in the mbe .",
    "for example , they found that the combination of @xmath9  and the ew of the [ ] @xmath121 narrow emission line provided the strongest anti - correlation with ew ( ) .",
    "only one of our wlqs , sdss  j1447@xmath200203 , has [ ] emission lines tentatively detected ; the spectra of the other four wlqs from @xcite do not cover the [ ] lines .",
    "our other four wlqs , sdss  j1141@xmath220219 , sdss  j1237@xmath226301 , sdss  j1521@xmath225202 , and phl  1811 ( as well as about a quarter of the sources from the hiz sample ; see @xcite ; n07 ) have tight upper limits on ew ( [ ] ) .",
    "while this may be consistent with the general trend of weaker lines in sources with weaker [ ] emission ( see bl04 and references therein ) , the limited [ ] statistics prevent us from testing whether this observable can explain part or all of the wlq deviation .",
    "we note , however , that the relative strength of [ ] as well as other observables studied by bl04 may all be governed primarily by the eddington ratio .",
    "additional parameters that may affect the relative strength of the line can be split broadly into properties of the i ) sed , and ii ) belr . a high eddington ratio results in a softer , uv - peaked sed , and this may naturally explain relatively weak lines due to the paucity of highly ionizing photons ;",
    "this model has been suggested for explaining the unusual properties of phl  1811 ( e.g. , @xcite @xcitea ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that phl  1811 , its high - redshift ` analog ' , sdss  j1521@xmath225202 @xcite , as well as sdss  j1447@xmath200203 which @xcite consider a ` borderline ' wlq ( or , an extreme ` wind - dominated ' quasar ) , appear to follow the mbe ( within @xmath122 ; see section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "these sources may be different than the rest of the wlqs in our sample in the sense that the eddington ratio alone may explain their weak lines.0203 and sdss  j1521@xmath225202 exhibit an effective power - law photon index ( @xmath107 ) of @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively , in the observed - frame @xmath125  kev band , indicating significant intrinsic absorption at least in the latter source @xcite , and phl  1811 exhibits @xmath126 in the observed - frame 0.3 - 5  kev band with no detectable intrinsic absorption ( @xciteb ) .",
    "] alternatively , the difference between phl  1811-like sources and the other , more extreme wlqs may be related to sed shielding ( or modification ) and orientation effects @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the ew()@xmath83  criterion we adopt for wlqs is statistically driven and it depends on the particular quasar sample under consideration ( see section  [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "it is more instructive , perhaps , to use a physically - motivated definition for wlqs as being clear outliers from the mbe , deviating by more than @xmath80 from this relation on the low - ew end ; i.e. , sources having , based on this work . given this definition , only five sources in our sample ( i.e. , further excluding sdss  j1237@xmath226301 with ) can be considered as wlqs , i.e. , sources for which the h@xmath1-based @xmath9  value may not fully explain their line weakness . finally , we note that a ` cold ' accretion disk , due to high @xmath8  values , has also been offered to explain the weak lines in wlqs @xcite ; detailed uv spectroscopy of wlqs is required to test the predictions of this model",
    ".    a variety of belr physical properties can also affect the relative strength of the line , such as the belr geometry , covering factor , density , and metallicity .",
    "extremely weak lines , such as those observed in wlqs with , may be attributed to a deficiency of gas in the belr ( i.e. , an  anemic  belr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or to an early evolutionary stage in the quasar s duty cycle where the belr just started to form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a more rigorous investigation of the parameters controlling the relative strengths of belr lines in quasars , which is beyond the scope of this work ,",
    "should include a comprehensive analysis of spectral information for low- and high - ionization belr lines as well as the sed shape , in conjunction with photoionization modeling , for a quasar sample much larger than studied herein .",
    "most importantly , the relative strengths of high - ionization belr lines , such as with ev , should be investigated jointly with the relative strengths of low - ionization belr lines , such as h@xmath1  with ev or with ev .",
    "for example , correlations involving ratios of the relative strengths of these lines , such as ew()/ew(h@xmath1 ) , as well as the -to - optical sed should be investigated in more detail ( e.g. , bl04 ; @xcite , 2012 ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it is necessary to decompose the belr lines into ` disk ' and ` wind ' ( or outflow ) components , in particular for ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in order to check whether the ew of each component of the line profile is correlated with a fundamental physical property , such as @xmath9 .",
    "detailed line - profile measurements , yielding emission - line blueshifts and line asymmetries , should provide additional insights ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we utilize a sample of 99 ordinary quasars across wide ranges of luminosity and redshift to show that the relative strength of the broad line is primarily anti - correlated with the h@xmath1-based eddington ratio , i.e. , a mbe , thus confirming and extending previous work limited to nearby , low - luminosity sources .",
    "we also find that all nine wlqs with available h@xmath1  and information in the archive have typical h@xmath1-based @xmath9  values in contrast with the extremely high values expected from the mbe .",
    "while the ews of the lines in four of these wlqs are consistent with the mbe , the other five wlqs deviate significantly from this relation by exhibiting ews much smaller than predicted from their h@xmath1-based @xmath9  values . in case",
    "the single - epoch h@xmath1-method can provide a reliable determination of @xmath8  in all quasars , then our results indicate that ew ( ) can not depend solely on @xmath9 .",
