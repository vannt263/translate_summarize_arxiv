    "small area estimation ( sae ) is widely used to produce stable estimates of population parameters for areas ( clusters ) with small , or even zero sample sizes . in the case of a small sample size , direct estimations based only on the sample in the area",
    "may lead to highly variable estimates .",
    "if direct estimates are not reliable , we have to rely on alternative model - based methods when constructing small area estimates . a popular approach to achieving a stable estimation",
    "is to use a mixed effects model or an empirical bayes estimation , in the bayesian context .",
    "fay and herriot ( 1979 ) and battese  ( 1988 ) proposed area - level and unit - level models , respectively , based on linear mixed models for data with continuous values .    in real data analyses ,",
    "we often encounter discrete data , which are inappropriate for a normality assumption , and need to use alternative models .",
    "a famous model used to handle discrete and continuous data is the generalized linear mixed model ( glmm ) ( mcculloch and searle , 2001 ) .",
    "this is a flexible and useful model , but the likelihood inference for the glmm is known to be computationally hard since it requires numerical integration with respect to random effects in order to obtain the marginal likelihood function .",
    "moreover , the best predictor or bayes estimator of a quantity of interest in the glmm can not be obtained in the closed form , and we again have to rely on numerical evaluation . as an alternative , ghosh and maiti ( 2004 ) , henceforth abbreviated to gm , proposed an empirical bayes method for area - level data , based on the natural exponential family and with quadratic variance functions ( nef - qvf ) . in the gm model , the distribution of observations follows the nef - qvf and its conjugate prior is used as the parameter of interest .",
    "the nef - qvf includes the poisson , binomial , and normal distributions .",
    "thus , the gm method provides flexible analyses of area - level data .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the glmm , the gm method does not require numerical integration when estimating the parameters or deriving the bayes estimator of a quantity of interest .",
    "the detailed settings of the gm model are provided in section [ gm ] .    in this regard ,",
    "the gm method is useful , but it assumes that the hyperparameters in the prior distribution are equal across all areas .",
    "this means that the geographical information is ignored in the estimating procedure .",
    "however , the hyperparameters may well be non - stationary ( different ) across areas , in which case our estimates need to include the geographical information .",
    "thus , in this study , we develop an empirical bayes method that includes geographical information .",
    "our method is actually a generalization of the gm method in terms of allowing for spatial non - stationarity of the hyperparameters . to estimate the non - stationary hyperparameters , we assume that the values of the hyperparameters become closer as the areas become smaller , in some sense . in other words ,",
    "the hyperparameters are some smooth function of geographical information .",
    "the geographically weighted regression ( gwr ) ( brunsdon et al . , 1998 ; fotheringham et al . , 2002 )",
    "is a method widely used in analyzing data that exhibit spatial non - stationarity , and we develop the method to obtain our hyperparameter estimates .",
    "the asymptotic properties of the gwr estimation can be established from the theory of local likelihood estimation ( tibshirani and hastie , 1987 ; staniswalis , 1989 ) . using these results , we confirm that the proposed estimator of the hyperparameters has consistency and asymptotic normality .",
    "then , we provide the geographically weighted empirical bayes ( gweb ) estimator by substituting the estimators of the spatially non - stationary hyperparameters into the bayes estimator .    in the context of small area estimation , evaluating",
    "the risk of the gweb estimators is important in real applications .",
    "therefore , we consider the approximated mean squared error ( mse ) of the gweb estimator with second - order accuracy and , thus , establish a second - order unbiased mse estimator based on the asymptotic properties of the hyperparameter estimators .",
    "furthermore , we examine the benchmarking estimation and the estimation of non - sampled areas . with regard to the benchmarking problem , we provide a benchmarked estimator based on a constrained bayes procedure ( ghosh , 1992 ; datta et al . , 2011 ) with risk evaluation .    in a related work , chandra et al",
    "( 2012 ) proposed a geographical weighted empirical best linear unbiased predictor ( gweblup ) for nested error regression models under spatial non - stationarity .",
    "using simulations , they showed that the gweblup can lead to efficiency gains when spatial non - stationarity is present in the data .",
    "however , their model only applies to continuous data .",
    "more recently , spatial modeling for estimations based on small area data have been proposed in the literature .",
    "pratesi and salvati ( 2008 ) proposed a spatial empirical best linear unbiased predictor for area - level models based on the simultaneously autoregressive ( sar ) structure .",
    "the sar is another approach for geographical information , but their model is also limited to continuous data .",
    "torabi ( 2014a ) considered a glmm with spatially correlated random effects and proposed a likelihood inference of the model parameters .",
    "the proposed model applies to discrete data , but the inferences rely on numerical calculations .",
    "on the other hand , our method includes geographical information in the models using hyperparameters instead of spatial correlation .",
    "thus , we do not rely on heavy numerical calculations .",
    "for other studies on spatial small area estimation , refer to singh et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , marhuenda et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and torabi ( 2014b ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : main ] , we review the gm method based on the nef - qvf and propose an extension to the spatial non - stationarity of hyperparameters . in this section , we also describe the procedure we use to obtain the gweb , provide the asymptotic properties of the hyperparameter estimators , and discuss the benchmarking problem and synthetic estimation . in section [ sec : mse ] , we consider the mse for the risk evaluation of the gweb and establish the second - order unbiased mse estimator . in section [ sec : simu ] , we conduct a model - based simulation to compare the prediction accuracies of the spatial and ( existing ) non - spatial models . here",
    ", we also investigate the finite sample performance of the mse estimator using the simulation",
    ". finally , in section [ sec : app ] , we apply our model to mortality data from tokyo .",
    "we first describe an empirical bayes method for area - level data using the natural exponential family proposed by ghosh and maiti ( 2004 ) , which we call the gm model .",

    "define @xmath7 by @xmath8 = \\psi'(\\th_i),\\ ] ] which is the mean of @xmath1 .",
    "assume that @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 for known constants @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , which are not simultaneously zero .",
    "this means that the variance @xmath15 is a quadratic function of the mean @xmath7 .",
    "this is the natural exponential family with the quadratic variance function ( nef - qvf ) studied by morris ( 1982 , 1983 ) .    as the random area effect ,",
    "ghosh and maiti ( 2004 ) consider the conjugate prior with the probability density function @xmath16c(\\nu , m_i),\\ ] ] for @xmath3 , where @xmath17 is an unknown scalar hyperparameter and @xmath18 is a function specific to each distribution .",

    ", we have to estimate @xmath37 in some way .",
    "since the marginal distribution of @xmath1 in this model can be obtained analytically , we can estimate @xmath37 based on the marginal log - likelihood , as follows : @xmath38.\\ ] ] then , substituting the estimator @xmath39 into the bayes estimator ( [ b ] ) , we get the empirical bayes estimator @xmath40 .      the gm model given in the previous subsection assumes that the hyperparameters are constant ( stationary ) across all areas .",
    "this means that the gm model treats all areas equivalently , regardless of the geographical relations between them .",
    "however , it is natural that the hyperparameters may be spatially nonstationary . in other words ,",
    "the hyperparameters are assumed to change such that @xmath37 is a function of the location @xmath41 of an area .",
    "a useful model for spatial non - stationarity with covariates is the geographically weighted regression ( gwr ) model ( brunsdon , 1998 , fotheringham , 2002 ) , which allows for spatial heterogeneity of the regression coefficients in a linear regression .",
    "the estimating procedure for the gwr is a weighted least squares estimation , where the weights are determined by some function of the distance between the areas .",
    "based on the idea of the gwr model , we apply the spatially varying parameters to the gm , as follows : @xmath42 , \\\\ \\th_i",

    ", we use the class of weight function @xmath53 with compact support on @xmath54 $ ] and that satisfies @xmath55 note that the weight function @xmath56 is obtained via a kernel function @xmath57 with compact support on @xmath58 $ ] and order @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "there are other orders of kernel functions , but we focus on and use the weight function generated by the kernel function with order 2 , for simplicity . as a useful example of such a weight function , we provide the function obtained from the quartic kernel ( mller , 1984 ) , given by @xmath61 and @xmath62 elsewhere .",
    "we use this weight function in our simulation and in our empirical study .    using @xmath63 from ( [ est ] ) , we obtain the empirical bayes estimator with spatially varying hyperparameters , as follows : @xmath64 which we call the geographically weighted empirical bayes ( gweb ) estimator . for simplicity , we denote @xmath65 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the weight function depends on a user - specified bandwidth @xmath66 .",
    "the value of this bandwidth is a measure of how quickly the weight decreases according to distance . in order to determine @xmath66 based on the available data , we propose using the following cross - validation ( cv ) procedure with a loss function : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the predicted value in the @xmath69-th area , based on @xmath70 , for bandwidth @xmath66 in the parameter estimation .",
    "the value of @xmath66 that minimizes ( [ cv ] ) is then used to calculate the gweb estimator ( [ sebp ] ) .",

    "the mortality rate is a representative index of the population and has been used in various fields .",

    ", the same mortality rate applies when 10 people died in an area with a population of 1,000 and when 1 person died in an area with a population of 100 .",
    "however , the mortality rate in the latter area is calculated based on mortality data from a smaller population than in the former area .",

    "we calculate the mortality rates by town and block and then by gender and then made adjustments so that the rates would correspond with the areas on the map .",
