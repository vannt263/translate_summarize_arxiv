    "the study of the thermodynamic properties of confined systems has attracted considerable attention over the last decades @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior of confined fluids is rather different from the bulk criticality due to the subtle interplay between finite - size and surface effects .",
    "the interaction of a saturated gas in contact with a wall or a substrate may result in the occurrence of very interesting wetting and capillary condensation phenomena , where a macroscopically thick liquid layer condenses at the wall , while the bulk fluid may remain in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "the wetting of solid surfaces by a fluid is a phenomena of primary importance in many fields of practical technological applications ( lubrication , efficiency of detergents , oil recovery in porous material , stability of paint coatings , interaction of macromolecules with interfaces , etc .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "wetting transitions are also observed when a magnetic material is confined between parallel walls where competing surface magnetic fields act .",
    "for example , when an ising @xcite film is confined between two competing walls a distance @xmath4 apart from each other , so that the surface magnetic fields ( @xmath5 ) are of the same magnitude but opposite direction , it is found that the competing fields cause the emergence of an interface that undergoes a localization - delocalization transition .",
    "this transition shows up at an @xmath6dependent temperature @xmath7 that is the precursor of the true wetting transition temperature @xmath8 of the infinite system @xcite .",
    "it should also be remarked that , although the discussion is presented here in terms of a magnetic language , the relevant physical concepts can rather straightforwardly be extended to other systems such as fluids , polymers , and binary mixtures .    on the other hand ,",
    "the study and understanding of the propagation of perturbations in magnetic material is also a subject of increasing interest . for this purpose ,",
    "the damage spreading method is a powerful and useful technique that has been applied , for example , to ising systems @xcite as well as to spin glasses @xcite , for a review see e.g. @xcite .    in order to apply the damage spreading method one has to start from an equilibrium configuration of the magnetic material at temperature @xmath9 .",
    "such a configuration is generically called the reference or unperturbed configuration @xmath10 .",
    "subsequently , a perturbed configuration @xmath11 is obtained just introducing a small perturbation into @xmath10 .",
    "this procedure can be achieved , e.g. by flipping a small number of spins of the unperturbed configuration .",
    "the time evolution of the perturbation is of primary interest because , either , it can become healed after some time ( eventually it may remain finite ) or it can propagated over the whole system . the latter scenario may be undesired when a thermally stable magnetic material needs to be achieved .",
    "a simple measure of the perturbation is the `` hamming distance '' or damage between the unperturbed and the perturbed configurations @xcite .",
    "then the time evolution of the perturbation can be followed evaluating the total damage @xmath12 defined as the fraction of spins with different orientations , that is @xmath13\\right| , \\label{eq : dam}\\ ] ] where the summation runs over the total number of spins @xmath14 and the index @xmath15 , ( @xmath16 ) is the label that identifies the spins of the configurations .    in our previous study of damage spreading using ising magnets confined in two - dimensional geometries @xcite and in absence of external magnetic fields , it has been shown that the presence of interfaces between magnetic domains , in the direction * perpendicular * to the propagation of the damage , causes the spatio - temporal enhancement of the spreading . due to this interesting feature and in order to contribute to the understanding of the role played by the interfaces , the aim of this work is to investigate the propagation of the damage at the interface generated by the localization - delocalization transition of the ising magnet confined in presence of competing magnetic fields . in this case , and in contrast to the previous work @xcite , the propagation of the damage occurs in the direction * parallel * to the interface . in order to carry out the study , monte carlo simulations of the ising magnet in confined , thin film , geometries are performed . imposing open boundary conditions and surface magnetic fields along the surfaces of the films , the propagation of the damage in both directions , parallel and perpendicular , to the domain interfaces can be studied .",
    "furthermore , extrapolations of the results to the thermodynamic limit allow us to determine the critical points of damage spreading and locate them in the wetting phase diagram , as evaluated exactly by abraham @xcite .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section ii the numerical procedure for the simulation of damage spreading in confined geometries is described .",
    "section iii is devoted to a brief discussion of the equilibrium configurations characteristic of confined geometries with competing applied magnetic fields .",
    "the results are presented and discussed the results in section iv , while the conclusions are stated in section v.",
    "the ising model with competing surface fields in a confined geometry of size @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) can be described by the following hamiltonian @xmath5 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the ising spin variables , corresponding to the site of coordinates @xmath21 , that may assume two different values , namely @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the coupling constant of the ferromagnet and the first summation of equation ( [ eq : ham ] ) runs over all the nearest - neighbor pairs of spins such as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the second ( third ) summation corresponds to the interaction of the spins placed at the surface layer @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) of the film where a short range surface magnetic field @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) acts .",
    "open boundary conditions are assumed along the @xmath30-direction of the film where the fields act .    in this manuscript ,",
    "only the case of competing surface fields such as @xmath31 , in the absence of any bulk magnetic field , is considered .",
    "so , hereafter @xmath32 will be used generically to specify the short range surface magnetic field that is measured in units of the coupling constant @xmath33 . under these conditions and for a suitable range of fields and temperatures",
    ", one may observe the onset of an interface between magnetic domains of opposite direction running along the film , as will be discussed in detail below .",
    "the evolution of the ising film is simulated using the glauber dynamics , so a randomly selected spin is flipped with probability @xmath34 given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the difference between the energy of the would - be new configuration and the old configuration , and @xmath37 is the usual boltzmann factor .",
    "the time is measured in monte carlo time steps ( mcs ) , such as during one mcs all @xmath17 spins of the sample are flipped once , in the average .",
    "the ising magnet in two dimensions and in absence of any external magnetic field , undergoes a second - order order - disorder transition when the temperature is raised from a relatively low initial value .",
    "the critical point is the so called onsager critical temperature @xmath38 @xcite .    in order to evaluate the damage according to equation ( [ eq",
    ": dam ] ) , first the reference configuration @xmath39 is generated , using the simulation method described above .",
    "this can be achieved starting from a random configuration and applying the glauber dynamics during @xmath40 mcs .",
    "subsequently , a replica of such configuration is created and the spins of the central column ( @xmath41 ) are flipped as follows : if the magnetization of the whole sample is greater than zero the up spins are flipped down , otherwise the down spins of the column are flipped up . using this procedure the perturbed configuration @xmath42 of equation ( [ eq : dam ] )",
    "is generated and it is assured that the initial damage ( at @xmath43 ) is always @xmath44 .",
    "this kind of perturbation reproduces the effect of a large magnetic field applied at the middle of the sample and pointing away to the opposite direction than the actual magnetization of the whole sample .",
    "the time evolution of the damage d(t ) , evaluated using equation ( [ eq : dam ] ) , is then followed applying the glauber dynamics to both configurations . at this stage",
    "it is essential to use the same random numbers in both systems in order to perform the updates @xcite .    applying the glauber dynamics to the ising ferromagnet",
    ", it is known that exists a critical temperature for damage spreading ( @xmath45 ) , such as for @xmath46 the damage spreads out over the whole sample while for @xmath47 the damage becomes healed after some finite time @xcite .",
    "extensive numerical simulations due to grassberger @xcite have shown that , in two dimensions and in absence on external magnetic fields , @xmath48 .",
    "since the aim of this manuscript is to investigate the role played by the interface between magnetic domains in the propagation of damage , it is worth discussing the different equilibrium configurations characteristic of confined geometries under different surface field conditions , close to the wetting phase transition .",
    "the situation originated by the presence of competing surface magnetic fields @xmath49 ( see equation ( [ eq : ham ] ) ) can be described in terms of a wetting transition that takes place at a certain -field dependent- critical wetting temperature @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath51 a small number of rows parallel to one of the surface of the film have an overall magnetization pointing to the same direction than the adjacent surface field .",
    "however , the bulk of the film has the opposite magnetization ( i.e. pointing in the direction of the another competing field ) .",
    "also the symmetric situation is equivalent to the previous one due to the spin - reversal field - reversal symmetry .",
    "these configurations , where the interface between domains is tightly bounded on the surface , are characteristic of the non - wet phase of the system that occurs at low enough temperatures and fields ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "increasing the temperature , such interface moves farther and farther away from the surface towards the bulk of the film .",
    "just at @xmath52 the interface is located in the middle of the film and the system reaches the wet phase for the first time . for @xmath53",
    "the interface is not longer localized and the system is within the wet phase ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it should be noticed that the above discussed wetting transition takes place in the thermodynamic limit only and the phase diagram has been evaluated exactly by abraham @xcite , yielding @xmath54 = \\sinh(2j \\beta ) , \\label{eq : abrah}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the critical surface field ( the inverse function of the wetting temperature @xmath50 ) .    as discussed above",
    ", a well defined wetting transition takes place in the thermodynamic limit only . nevertheless , as shown in figure(2 ) a precursor of this wetting transition can also be observed in confined geometries for finite values of @xmath4 .",
    "this precursor is most correctly described in terms of a localization - delocalization transition of the interface , which takes place at @xmath6dependent critical temperatures @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath57 ( figure 2(a ) ) one observes coexistence of two phases , each of them having opposite magnetization .",
    "furthermore , the interface between domains is located close to one of the surfaces of the film ( localized interface ; non - wet regime ) . for @xmath58 ( figure 2(c ) ) , the wall between domains moves along the @xmath4-direction and the system enters to the wet regime ( delocalized interface ) .",
    "the mean position of the interface remains close to the center of the film just at @xmath59 ( figure 2(b ) ) .    according to the finite - size scaling theory @xcite @xmath59 shifts towards @xmath50 according to : @xmath60 when the system size @xmath4 tends to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "for further discussions on the localization - delocalization transition of the ising system in confined geometries see e.g. @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth discussing the equilibrium configurations obtained in absence of magnetic fields and close below to @xmath61 , as shown in figure 2(d ) . in this case",
    "the confined system forms a nonuniform state given by a succession of up - spins and down - spins domains , which are essentially ordered at length scales such as the standard correlation length ( @xmath62 ) remains smaller than the characteristic size of the system ( @xmath63 ) , but the domain walls are randomly placed .",
    "the operation of surface magnetic fields favors the parallel spins , and thus suppress this domain formation .",
    "these facts can be recognized from a visual inspection of the domain patterns shown in figure 2 .",
    "monte carlo simulations have been performed using @xmath64-lattices , for the choices @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "preliminary runs indicate that the damage spreading transition can be observed , in principle , for any range of temperatures and fields close to the critical wetting line as defined by equation ( [ eq : abrah ] ) .",
    "however , when the temperature is very low the system becomes almost frozen making difficult the acquisition of data with reliable statistics . also , for @xmath69 the system is disordered preventing the occurrence of the wetting transition . taking into account these constraints ,",
    "an extensive study of damage spreading has been performed only close to two particular points of the whole wet non - wet phase diagram , namely for @xmath70 , and for @xmath71 .",
    "additional studies have also been carried out close to @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    on view of the obtained results",
    ", it is expected that the main conclusions obtained from the study will hold close to the whole critical wetting curve .    in order to characterize the global dynamics of the propagation of the perturbation , the whole damage given by the hamming distance @xmath12 ( see equation ( [ eq : dam ] ) ) and the survival probability @xmath74 , that is the probability that at time @xmath75 the damage is still propagating ,",
    "have been evaluated . also , to study the spatio - temporal evolution of the perturbation , the damage profile in the perpendicular ( parallel ) @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) direction is defined as follows : @xmath78\\right| , \\label{eq : perfilx}\\ ] ] and @xmath79\\right| , \\label{eq : perfily}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the unperturbed and perturbed equilibrium configurations , respectively .",
    "this definition of the perpendicular ( parallel ) damage profile represents the average damaged sites of the @xmath82 - @xmath83 column ( @xmath84 - @xmath85 row ) of the lattice . in order to characterize",
    "the profiles it is also useful to determine their width ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) , as well as their amplitude ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) , respectively .",
    "the propagation of the damage is studied using two approaches : i ) keeping @xmath90 constant and varying @xmath9 , and ii ) keeping @xmath91 constant and varying @xmath0 .",
    "figure 3 shows log - log plots of the damage @xmath12 as function of time .",
    "it is interesting to note that the localization - delocalization transition is roughly revealed by the behavior of the damage .",
    "in fact , for @xmath93 , ( e.g. for @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 in figure 3(a ) ) it is observed that the damage is healed after a relatively short time .",
    "however for @xmath97 ( e.g. for @xmath98 and @xmath99 in figure 3(a ) ) the spreading of damage is actually observed .",
    "it should be noticed that using finite lattices , the onset of damage spreading is observed at @xmath4-dependent `` critical '' temperatures ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "as expected , finite - size effects cause the actual transition to become rounded and shifted , as e.g. can be observed comparing figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) , which have been obtained using lattices of different size .",
    "the straight lines observed in figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) for @xmath101 suggest a power - law behavior such as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is an exponent . disregarding the early time behavior of @xmath12 ( say up to @xmath104 mcs ) ,",
    "the best fit of the data shown in figure 3(a ) , using equation ( [ eq : pwlaw ] ) , gives @xmath105 .",
    "simulations performed using bigger lattices ( @xmath106 , see e.g. figure 3(b ) ) also give @xmath107 , where in all cases the error bars merely reflect the statistical error .    notice that damage spreading is also observed for a temperature slightly below @xmath108 ( e.g. at @xmath109 in figure 3(a ) and @xmath110 in figure 3(b ) ) .",
    "this observation is due to the operation of finite size effects causing the effective location of the prewetting temperature to be slightly below @xmath111 ( see eq.([eq : tfinsize ] ) ) .",
    "eventually , this result may also indicate that the critical temperature for damage spreading lies below @xmath111 , as will be discussed below .",
    "the survival probability of the damage @xmath74 is shown in figure 4 , as a function of time @xmath75 .",
    "it is observed that @xmath74 tends to vanish for @xmath112 , while it reaches a stationary value for @xmath113 .",
    "so , it is possible to define the stationary survival probability @xmath114 as the asymptotic limit @xmath115 , ( see figure 5(a ) ) . in this case ,",
    "finite - size effects are also observed .",
    "in fact , the step function expected for the @xmath116 becomes rounded for lattices of size @xmath65 and @xmath117 .",
    "however , the damage temperature @xmath100 can be determined as the mean value of the rounded step .",
    "figure 6(a ) shows log - log plots of the width of the damage profile @xmath118 _ vs _ @xmath75 obtained taking @xmath92 and different temperatures .",
    "it is observed that for @xmath113 ( @xmath112 ) the width exhibits an upward ( downward ) curvature .",
    "however , a straight line behavior emerges for a certain temperature that is identified as @xmath119 . based on these observations ,",
    "the following scaling law is proposed , @xmath120 where @xmath121 is an exponent .",
    "the best fit of the data gives @xmath122 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a different behavior has been observed for zero surface fields ( @xmath123 ) close to the critical temperature @xcite , as shown in figure 6(b ) . in this limit",
    "the critical temperature for damage spreading is well known , namely @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "however , in this case a crossover between a short - time ( st ) regime and a long - time ( lt ) regime is found close to @xmath125 mcs . for @xmath126",
    "mcs the data is consistent with @xmath127 , while for @xmath128 mcs one has @xmath129 .",
    "this results also suggests that a diffusive - like behavior , as expected for @xmath130 , dominates the short - time regime , while the propagation of the perturbation becomes faster within the long - time regime .",
    "the observed difference between the cases @xmath131 and @xmath123 can be understood with the aid of the snapshot configurations shown in figures 2(a - c ) and 2(d ) , respectively .",
    "in fact , when the interface is most likely localized at the center of the strip running parallel to the @xmath30-direction , where the surface magnetic fields are applied , one expects an uniform propagation of the perturbation as observed in figure ( 6(a ) ) .",
    "however , for @xmath123 the occurrence of magnetic domains of opposite orientation exhibiting interfaces running perpendicular to the strip determines the onset of two different time regimes : on the one hand the short - time regime , characterized by the ( slow ) propagation of the damage inside the bulk of magnetic domains and , on the other hand , the long - time regime with a ( faster ) propagation of the perturbation effectively catalyzed by large fluctuations occurring at the interfaces of the domains .",
    "the amplitude of the damage profile in the direction parallel to the interface @xmath132 , as shown in figure 7 , also exhibits a power - law behavior of the type : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is an exponent",
    ". a least - square fit of the data ( see figure 7 ) gives @xmath135 , for @xmath101 . also , the damage tends to become healed for @xmath112 .",
    "simulations performed using bigger lattices shows that this exponent tends to @xmath136 for the asymptotic limit , @xmath137 , e.g. @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "figure 8 shows damage profiles @xmath77 obtained at different times , and close to @xmath100 . for the absence of surface fields and using open boundary conditions ( figure 8(a ) ) , the homogeneous propagation of the damage is observed .",
    "however , considering competing surface fields the damage tends to propagate in the region where the interface between magnetic domains is located , namely at the central rows of the film ( @xmath140 ) , as shown in figure 8(b ) .",
    "this fact is in qualitative agreement with the results discussed for @xmath141 .",
    "moreover , it is observed that the effect of the magnetic fields at the walls is to slow down the propagation of the damage .",
    "these observations are consistent with the fact that large fluctuations capable to catalyze the propagation of the damage are present along the interface , while at the walls and due to the applied magnetic fields , the orientation of the spins is more stable .",
    "it should be noted that due to the finite size of the lattice , the width of the damage profile @xmath142 , remains constant close to @xmath143 , preventing a quantitative analysis .",
    "based on the study of @xmath12 , @xmath74 and the damage profiles , the location of the @xmath6dependent damage spreading critical points @xmath100 , for a fixed field @xmath144 , have been estimated as follows : @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 . based on these results and assuming that @xmath100 obeys a scaling law such as equation ( [ eq : tfinsize ] ) , the extrapolation @xmath148 has been obtained , as shown in figure 9 .",
    "this value is close ( but smaller ) to the wetting critical temperature @xmath149 , as evaluated using eq.([eq : abrah ] ) ( see also figure 1 ) . it is known that one method to locate the @xmath6dependent critical temperatures for the localization - delocalization transition ( @xmath150 ) , which is the precursor of the true wetting temperature in the thermodynamic limit , is the evaluation of the maximum of the susceptibility , i.e. the fluctuations of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "figure 9 also shows that a plot of @xmath150 _ vs _ @xmath151 ( see equation ( [ eq : tfinsize ] ) ) extrapolates to @xmath152 , in good agreement with the exact value .",
    "furthermore , one has that @xmath153 .    at this stage",
    "it is concluded that , on the one hand , it is hard to establish an unambiguous difference between @xmath45 and @xmath52 , while on the other hand , it is out of any doubt that the onset of damage propagation is related to the localization - delocalization transition that undergoes the interface between competing domains , so that @xmath45 is effectively shifted to temperatures far below from @xmath61 .      in this case , the obtained results are fully consistent with those obtained keeping the field constant and varying the temperature .",
    "in fact , the total damage @xmath12 grows up for @xmath155 with exponent @xmath156 ( see figure 10 ) , where @xmath157 is @xmath6dependent critical field for damage spreading .",
    "also , it is observed that for lattices of size @xmath158 , the damage spreading transition is markedly rounded by finite - size effects ( figure 10(a ) ) , while for @xmath159 that transition is better defined ( figure 10(b ) ) .",
    "the stationary survival probability of the damage @xmath114 can also be determined , as shown in figure 5(b ) as a function of the surface field @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that the stepped shape of @xmath114 is better defined in figure 5(b ) than in figure 5(a ) is an intriguing feature that remains to be clarified .",
    "the width of the damage profile also behaves according to a power law ( see equation ( [ eq : pwlaw ] ) with an exponent @xmath160 ( see figure 11 ) , in full agreement with our previous estimation given by @xmath161 .",
    "it is found that the amplitude of the profile , @xmath162 , also exhibits a power law close to @xmath45 ( figure 12 ) .",
    "in fact , the exponent @xmath134 ( see equation ( [ hy ] ) , has been determined given : @xmath163 , in full agreement with our estimation obtained keeping constant the surface fields , namely @xmath164 .",
    "it has been observed that the amplitude along the parallel direction and the width of the profiles across the perpendicular direction ( @xmath88 and @xmath87 , respectively ) , exhibit the same behavior than in the previous case with constant surface fields , so the corresponding figures are omitted for the sake of space .",
    "finally , our estimations of the size dependent damage spreading critical fields @xmath165 are given by : @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .    by comparison to equation ( [ eq : tfinsize ] )",
    "the following finite size scaling anzats can be expected to hold for the wetting critical field @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the position of the critical point in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "plotting the obtained data for the damage spreading critical fields according to equation ( [ eq : hfinsize])(figure 13 ) , the extrapolation to @xmath137 gives @xmath171 , while the exact value for the wetting critical point at @xmath172 , as obtained using equation ( [ eq : abrah ] ) , is @xmath173 .",
    "as in the previous case , the location of the damage spreading critical point lies slightly inside the non - wet region of the phase diagram ( see figure 1 ) .      in order to confirm the findings of the previous sections , additional simulations were performed at @xmath174 and @xmath175 and varying the surface fields .",
    "all the obtained results are consistent with the previous findings . in summary , applying the scaling anzats given by equation ( [ eq : hfinsize ] ) , the critical field for damage spreading @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) was obtained , as compared with the exact result for the wetting critical point ( e.g. equation ( [ eq : abrah ] ) ) given by @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "notice that the former extrapolation is shown in figure 13 .",
    "based on an extensive numerical study of the damage propagation close to the wetting transition of the ising model with competing fields it is possible to draw the following main conclusions :    \\i ) the exponent governing the spreading of the total damage ( @xmath180 , see eq.([eq : pwlaw ] ) ) , in the presence of interfaces in the direction parallel to the propagation of the perturbation , namely @xmath181 , is greater than the obtained in absence of interface , namely @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "so , clearly the interface causes the enhancement of the propagation of the perturbation .    from a more qualitative point of view",
    ", it is expected that the propagation of damage may be favored by interfaces because precisely around these regions of the sample one has the largest fluctuations in the orientation of the spins . within this scenario",
    "the spreading of the damage is expected to be faster along the direction parallel to the interface where the fluctuations can uniformly be propagated .",
    "in contrast , the spreading along the direction perpendicular to the interface may be slowed down by the periods where the damage has to cross over the bulk of the domains @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) clear evidence on the shift of the critical damage temperature is reported .",
    "in fact , while it is well known that @xmath183 in the absence of surface magnetic fields @xcite , our finding show that @xmath184 when competing surface fields are applied .",
    "furthermore , all the damage spreading critical points extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit lie systematically within the non - wet phase of the wetting phase diagram ( figure 1 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the wetting and the damage spreading critical curves are different and point out that the former should be slightly shifted towards the non - wet phase .",
    "we expect that this numerical work may contributed to the understanding of the role of interfaces in the propagation of damage .",
    "the overall understanding of these complex physical phenomena addresses a significant theoretical and experimental challenge .",
    "such kind of studies are stimulated by many practical and technological applications as e.g. the design and construction of high quality magnetic materials .",
