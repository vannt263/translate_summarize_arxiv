    "the flow regime of a plasma is more complex than that of a neutral gas .",
    "two parameters are important in determining the flow regimes of plasma , which are the knudsen number @xmath8 and the normalized larmor radius @xmath9 .",
    "the knudsen number is the ration between the particle mean free path to the characteristic length , and the normalized larmor radius is the ratio between the larmor radius and the characteristic length .",
    "the knudsen number indicates the collision intensity and the normalized larmor radius indicates how strong the plasma is magnetized .",
    "the plasma behaves similar to two - species neutral gas mixture when @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath11 , the different species in plasma are closely coupled by electromagnetic field .    on the kinetic scale ,",

    "based on the high accurate phase space reconstruction techniques , these vlasov solvers can capture solutions of the collisionless vlasov equation accurately .",

    "those methods are based on the single - fluid hydrodynamic equations , and hence can only be applied on the scale much larger than the larmor radius and in the regime close to equilibrium .",
    "another type of schemes are proposed for the two fluid system @xcite .",
    "the two fluid model takes into account the electron mass and the separation of electrons and ions , which can recover the flow regime from mhd to euler regime .    in the transitional regime ,",
    "hybrid methods are usually proposed to connect the kinetic solver with the hydrodynamic one @xcite . in the hybrid models ,",
    "the pic method is used in the collisionless regime and the hydrodynamic models are used in the collisional regime .",
    "the main difficulty of the hybrid method is to find a proper criteria to couple different numerical models . and the solutions are not physically reliable in the transitional regime .",
    "another asymptotic preserving ( ap ) scheme of the fpl equation in @xcite can preserve the collisionless and euler regimes , but the scheme is currently built on one species , where the two species effect and the mhd limit can not be resolved .",
    "a good review about ap methods and multiscale models for plasma physics was given recently by degond and deluzet @xcite .",
    "even with asymptotic preserving property , the cell size is still limited by the mean free path scale for accuracy consideration for the capturing of dissipative solution .    in the past years , the ugks has been proposed based on the methodology of direct modeling . for the rarefied gas dynamics , radiative transfer , and phonon transport ,",

    "<S> a unified gas kinetic scheme ( ugks ) for multi - scale and multi - component plasma transport is constructed . </S>",
    "<S> the current scheme is a direct modeling method , where the time evolution solutions from the vlasov - bgk equations of electron and ion , and the maxwell equations are used to construct a scale - dependent plasma simulation model . as a result , with the changing of modeling scales of mesh size and time step , the discretized governing equations for a wide range of plasma evolution regimes </S>",
    "<S> are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the ugks takes into account the electron inertia , full electromagnetic field equations , and separate electron and ion evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the physics recovered in ugks ranges from the kinetic vlasov equation to the hydrodynamic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations . </S>",
    "<S> the unified treatment covers all scales from the collisionless particle transport to the hydrodynamic wave interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the ugks provides a more general evolution model than the vlasov equation in the kinetic scale and many types of mhd equations in the hydrodynamic scale , such as the two fluids model , the hall , the resistive , and the ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations . </S>",
    "<S> all above specific governing equations become the subsets of the ugks . the key dynamics in ugks </S>",
    "<S> is the un - splitting treatment of particle collision , acceleration , and transport in the construction of numerical flux across a cell interface , and this flux is a scale - dependent time evolving integral solution of the vlasov - bgk model . at the same time , the plasma evolution is coupled with the maxwell equations with a preservation of divergence constraints in a semi - implicit way . the ugks is able to give a physically accurate solution for plasma simulation with a large variation of knudsen number and normalized larmor radius . </S>",
    "<S> it can be used to simulate the phenomena from vlasov limit to the scale of plasma skin depth for the capturing of two - fluid effect , and the plasma transition regime with a modest knudsen number and normalized larmor radius , where few result has ever been obtained in this regime . </S>",
    "<S> the ugks is validated by numerical test cases , such as the landau damping and two stream instability in the kinetic regime , and the brio - wu shock tube problem and the orszag - tang mhd turbulence problem in the mhd regime . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is also used to study the geospace environment modeling ( gem ) , such as the challenging magnetic reconnection problem , in the transition regime . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the ugks is a physically reliable multi - scale plasma simulation method . </S>",
    "<S> it provides a powerful and unified approach for the study of plasma physics .    unified gas - kinetic scheme , plasma , vlasov equation , two - fluid equations , mhd equations , magnetic field reconnection . </S>"
