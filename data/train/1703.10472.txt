    "a better understanding of diffraction and exclusive processes at lhc is not only useful on its own ( an experimentalist s view on the diffraction physics program and early exclusive measurements at lhc is discussed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , it is also profitable for other lhc analyses where they form a non - negligible background . both types of processes were measured at hera and tevatron but cross sections are still known with a limited precision at lhc .",
    "furthermore , results of such measurements are important in various monte carlo tunes .",
    "all three presented processes have a common feature regarding the final state , namely the existence of rapidity gaps , i.e. regions in detector devoid of hadronic activity .",
    "the large rapidity gaps , or intact proton in the final state , refer to the colorless exchange .",
    "since the intact proton was not measured in the data used in these analyses ( the special forward proton detectors around the atlas detector @xcite were only installed during the run ii ) , we are left with two approaches to select the signal and reduce the background .",
    "either we select only events with large rapidity gaps in the central detector and then we are forced to concentrate on low pile - up and measure processes with large cross - sections ; or we require no tracks and vertices around the lepton vertex and then we can also use data samples with a large pile - up and hence access processes with low cross - sections .",
    "the former approach was used in the analysis of diffractive dijets where used data come from first runs of lhc with a relatively low pile - up .",
    "the latter approach was then used in the remaining two analyses where much larger data samples were analyzed but also with a more significant amount of pile - up .",
    "the processes with intact protons are divided into two broad classes .",
    "the photon - induced processes which are calculable using quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) include qed diffractive processes such as single dissociation ( sd ) , double dissociation ( dd ) and qed exclusive processes , which can be calculated with a precision of down to 2% ( based on the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) ) but where proton absorptive corrections can reach up to 20% .",
    "the qed exclusive processes with @xmath1  or @xmath2  in the final state are the signal in two analyses reported in this text and their feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] left and middle .    the second class of processes is formed by parton - induced processes calculable via quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and including sd , dd and double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) processes for which we also need to consider the so called soft survival probabilities if we study them at hadron colliders .",
    "the qcd exclusive processes are not discussed in this text .",
    "the process of interest in the remaining analysis reported here is dijet production in sd events , see fig .",

    "@xcite a huge factor of discrepancy ( @xmath410 ) between the measured data and theory predictions based on diffractive parton density functions ( dpdf ) measured at hera was observed .",
    "this discrepancy translates into the fact that measured dpdfs are not universal , in other words that the factorisation is broken .",
    "this is usually explained by rescattering of the dissociated system with the intact proton and the amount of this discrepancy is often called rapidity gap survival probablity or simply soft survival probability , @xmath5 . in most of cases at hera",
    "the factorisation holds and hence @xmath6 , since it is the photon , a much simpler system than the proton , that enters the diffraction reaction and hence no other rescattering is expected .",
    "nevertheless also at hera the factorisation may be broken in special cases where this photon has time to develop its structure and hence to be resolved @xcite .",
    "a natural question thus is what value of @xmath5 we can expect for the same process , dijets with rapidity gap , at lhc .",
    "it should be , however , stressed that the concept of @xmath5 is not well - defined theoretically . in some models",
    "this probability is embedded in amplitude calculations , in other models it is possible to factorise it . in any case , this quantity depends on the process studied and on kinematics . in @xcite",
    "it was obtained by comparing the data to the pomwig model after subtracting from data the background from non - diffractive processes ( nd ) and dd using pythia 8.1 .",
    "the measured value is @xmath7  % with rather large systematic uncertainties coming from model dependence .",
    "results that are easier to interpret are corrected cross - sections as functions of the forward gap size , @xmath8 and the fraction of four - momentum of the incident proton carried by pomeron , @xmath9 . from fig .",
    "[ djets ] we can see that the gap plateau observed and expected in the gap analysis with no jet requirement @xcite is not observed here , which can be simply explained by the topology : the presence of at least two jets , each with a radius @xmath10 does not leave much space for large gaps .",
    "[ djets ] also provides a comparison of the data with pythia 8.1 where the nd contribution is normalized to match the data in the first @xmath9  bin and the sd and dd contributions are used with default cross - sections .",
    "the striking feature of pythia 8.1 model is that the sum of nd , sd and dd contributions describes the data satisfactorily , i.e. with @xmath6 .",
    "we also see that the nd contribution extends to fairly large gaps and small @xmath9 values .     and",

    "this is a standard candle process thanks to its simple final state which can also be used for a luminosity calibration as well as for alignment and calibration of forward proton detectors afp @xcite and ct - pps @xcite .",
    "the cross - sections , however , are small and hence only calibration / alignment over larger data taking periods would be possible .",
    "a key requirement is the so called exclusivity veto demanding no tracks with transverse momentum @xmath11  gev from the lepton vertex and in addition no tracks and vertices within at least 3  mm from the longitudinal isolation of the lepton vertex .",
    "then after requiring the dilepton mass to be in a window of 70 and 105  gev and restricting the lepton @xmath12 to be below 1.5  gev , two acoplanarity distributions are made , namely @xmath13 and @xmath14 where data are compared to predictions of herwig++ for exclusive , of lpair for sd and of powheg and pythia for dd and drell yan processes .",
    "the best description of the data is reached when the exclusive and sd contributions are scaled by factors 0.863 and 0.759 , respectively , for the @xmath15 pair , or by 0.791 and 0.762 , respectively , for the muon pair .",
    "it is important to note that these scaling factors were found in agreement with those predicted in ref .",
    "the measured fiducial cross - sections for the exclusive @xmath16  are @xmath17 ( stat ) @xmath18 ( syst ) pb and @xmath19 ( stat ) @xmath20 ( syst ) pb . these values are found in a very good agreement with cross - sections based on epa and corrected for absorptive corrections which range around 20% as well as with cms measurement ( see fig .",

    "the analysis described in ref .",
    "@xcite aims at estimating anomalous quartic gauge couplings ( aqgc ) @xmath21 and collecting first candidates of exclusive higgs boson decaying into the @xmath2  pair decaying further to @xmath22 .",
    "this analysis profits from the measurement of the exclusive leptons presented in the previous section .",
    "again the key requirement is the exclusivity veto described above , only the dilepton vertex longitudinal isolation is required to be less than 1  mm because in this sample data are more contaminated by pile - up . similarly also the acomplanarity distributions are constructed , from which a ratio of observed to predicted qed exclusive events is extracted to be 0.76 which is in a reasonable agreement with values obtained in the dilepton analysis .",
    "non - existent simulation of sd and dd @xmath3  processes is accounted for by multiplying predicted qed exclusive @xmath3  events by a factor 3.3 obtained using exclusive @xmath16  events in the region @xmath23160  gev from herwig++ .",
    "this number is found to be in agreement with that predicted in ref .",
    "the measured cross - section for the process @xmath3  in standard model extrapolated to the full @xmath24  phase space is @xmath25@xmath3@xmath26 ( stat ) @xmath27 1.4 ( syst )  fb which can be compared to the predicted herwig++ cross section of 4.4 @xmath27 0.3  fb .",
    "the background - only hypothesis corresponds to a significance of 3.0 .",
    "limits on aqgc are obtained using event yields in the distribution of @xmath12 of the electron - muon pair for @xmath28  gev and are visualised in fig .",
    "[ exclww ] .",
    "we can see that the limits are compatible with those by cms and they are more stringent than those published by opal , d0 and cms . while studied in detail phenomonelogically ( see e.g. @xcite ) , this analysis reports on finding first exclusive higgs boson candidates at lhc experimentally .",

    "the signal is obtained using kmr calculations which are based on gluon - induced production @xcite and the background is dominantly the exclusive @xmath2  and inclusive @xmath2  processes .",
    "these yields are then converted to the exclusive higgs boson total production cross - section using the cls technique @xcite which gives @xmath30  pb at 95% cl ( observed ) and @xmath31  pb at 95% cl ( expected ) .",
