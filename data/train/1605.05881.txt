    "after the 7 and 8 tev runs of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , it has been clarified that a higgs boson exists with a mass of about 125 gev and that its measured properties  such as the signal strengths of various production and decay channels  are consistent with those of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson @xcite .",
    "although this suggests the existence of an isospin doublet scalar field , there remains an open question : i.e. , how many doublets are there in the actual higgs sector ?    the existence of a second higgs doublet is strongly expected when we consider physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) . the most familiar example is the case of supersymmetric extensions of the sm , in which at least two higgs doublets are required to generate all the masses of charged fermions and for anomaly cancellation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , extra sources of cp - violation can be obtained from higgs sectors with a multi - doublet structure , an ingredient which is necessary to realise a successful scenario based on electro - weak ( ew ) baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the second doublet is often introduced in models for neutrino masses  @xcite and dark matter  @xcite .",
    "therefore , adopting a bottom - up approach while studying the phenomenology of multi - higgs - doublet models is important in order to access bsm physics .",
    "one of the characteristic features of extended higgs models is the appearance of charged higgs bosons , so that their detection can be taken as direct evidence of such structures . in particular in multi - doublet models ,",
    "singly charged higgs bosons can affect various flavour observables such as @xmath11-meson related processes .",
    "for example , @xmath0 data give a lower limit on the mass and yukawa couplings of charged higgs bosons . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the branching ratio ( br ) of @xmath0 has been calculated at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd in the context of 2-higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) with a softly - broken @xmath1 symmetry . in refs .",
    "@xcite the calculation has been extended to next - to - nlo ( nnlo ) . from  @xcite , the lower limit on the mass of a charged higgs boson @xmath12 is given to be about 480 gev at 95% confidence level ( cl ) in the type - ii 2hdm when @xmath13 , which is the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two doublets , is taken to be larger than 2 .",
    "in contrast , a milder bound from @xmath0 is extracted in the type - i 2hdm , e.g. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 gev when @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively  @xcite , with the lower bound on @xmath18 weakening with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "it is important to mention here that , in addition to type - i and type - ii 2hdms , the type - x and type - y 2hdms can also be defined depending on the @xmath1 charge assignment   @xcite and that the same bound on @xmath12 from @xmath0 as in the type - ii ( type - i ) 2hdm is obtained in the type - y ( type - x ) 2hdm because of the identical structure of the quark yukawa interactions .",
    "it is then interesting to consider a light charged higgs boson scenario with @xmath19 in which @xmath20 states can be produced via a top quark decay ( @xmath21 ) , a channel which is being searched for at the lhc experiments .",
    "if we consider 2hdms , such a scenario is allowed in type - i and type - x for @xmath22 and it has been shown that the charged higgs boson mainly decays into @xmath23 in this parameter space @xcite . however ,",
    "if we consider models with more than two higgs doublets , one can find charged higgs bosons decaying copiously into different final states .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the phenomenology of charged higgs bosons in 3-higgs doublet models ( 3hdms ) .",
    "two softly - broken discrete @xmath1 symmetries are imposed in order to realise the natural flavour conserving ( nfc ) scenario , where only one of the three doublets couples to each type of fermion in order to avoid flavour changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at the tree level . under these @xmath1 symmetries , we define five independent types of yukawa interactions in analogy with the four types of yukawa interactions in @xmath1 symmetric 2hdms . in 3hdms",
    "there are two physical charged higgs bosons ( denoted by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with @xmath26 ) and more parameters determine the phenomenology of the charged higgs sector than in 2hdms . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the phenomenology of @xmath24 in 3hdms has been studied with decoupled @xmath25 in terms of effective yukawa couplings for the down - type quark , up - type quark and charged lepton , which are expressed by a function of four independent parameters  @xcite in the framework of nfc .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath27 can be lighter than the top quark while satisfying constraints from @xmath0 even for the case with type - ii like yukawa couplings . moreover ,",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the decay channel @xmath28 can have a large br ( up to @xmath6 ) in a 3hdm .",
    "although such a value is possible in the type - y 2hdm for @xmath29 , the constraint @xmath30 gev from @xmath0 rules out this scenario .",
    "hence a large br(@xmath31 ) is a distinctive signature of 3hdms .    however , there are some important shortcomings in the previous approach where the heavier charged higgs boson is decoupled from the theory .",
    "if one takes the decoupling limit of the heavier charged higgs boson , then the mixing angle between the two charged higgs bosons asymptotically approaches zero because of the structure of the charged scalar mass matrix . eventually , this situation makes the predictions in 3hdms identical to those in 2hdms . in other words",
    ", the effective coupling approach  @xcite is implicitly assuming that a cancellation is occurring between the contributions of the two charged higgs bosons to @xmath32 , and the heavier charged higgs boson should not be too heavy in order for sufficient cancellation to occur .",
    "thus in this paper , we clarify the 3hdm phenomenology with a non - decoupled @xmath33 and , consequently , the impact of @xmath33 on flavour physics and its typical collider signatures have not been clarified either .",
    "we compute the br of @xmath0 at nlo in qcd in 3hdms by taking into account both @xmath27 and @xmath33 loops , in which the dependence of the relevant five independent parameters , i.e. , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , two ratios of vevs and a mixing angle between @xmath27 and @xmath33 , is explicitly shown with a fixed type of yukawa interaction .",
    "we then discuss the phenomenology of @xmath27 and @xmath33 at the lhc in the parameter space allowed by @xmath0 and by the direct searches for charged higgs bosons via @xmath21 with @xmath34 at the tevatron and lhc as well as pair production @xmath35 at lep 2 .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that current lhc searches for @xmath20 do not have sensitivity to the region @xmath36 gev provided that @xmath20 has a sizeable branching ratio to @xmath37 and/or @xmath5 , and lep2 searches did not rule out the possibility of a @xmath20 in this region .",
    "we then interface these results to the standard hadro - production mode @xmath38 + c.c .",
    "discussed in @xcite , where analytical formulae can be found .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in sec .",

    "we have then shown that the decay branching fractions of @xmath85 can be dominant in the type - y and type - z 3hdm when the masses of the charged higgs bosons are taken to be below @xmath86 . the @xmath87 decay can also be dominant in the type - y 2hdm with @xmath29 , but such a light charged higgs boson scenario is excluded by the constraint from @xmath0 . in contrast , in 3hdms , the scenario with masses of @xmath79 gev for the charged higgs bosons is allowed by @xmath0 because of a cancellation between the separate contributions from the @xmath27 and @xmath33 loop diagrams . therefore , the search for a light charged higgs boson decaying into @xmath5 is a means to distinguish 3hdms from 2hdms .",
    "we then have calculated the branching fraction of the @xmath0 process at nlo in qcd in 3hdms in order to confirm how the cancellation takes place numerically .",

    "we drew attention to the fact that the region of @xmath93 gev is not constrained by current lhc searches for @xmath94 followed by dominant decay @xmath95 , and this parameter space is only weakly constrained from lep2 and tevatron searches . any future signal in this region",
    "could be readily accommodated by @xmath24 from a 3hdm finally , upon running a mc simulation to compare the yield of the @xmath71 signals and @xmath96 background through the production processes @xmath97 + c.c and @xmath98 + c.c , respectively , followed by the corresponding di - jet decays @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we have shown that the aforementioned charged higgs boson signals should be accessible at run 2 of the lhc over a suitable region of the 3hdm parameter space , provided that @xmath56-tagging is enforced so as to single out the @xmath5 component above the @xmath37 one .",
