    "the majority of magnetic systems have more than one characteristic energy scale , according to the different nature of interactions between the spins . for example , in low - dimensional magnets strong interactions within chains or planes are of direct exchange or superexchange type , whereas weak interchain ( interplane ) couplings may have purely dipolar origin.@xcite the different energy scale of these interactions implies that , at sufficiently high temperatures , the magnetic behavior is solely determined by the strong couplings , and the system can be fully described in terms of a low - dimensional spin model . however , at low temperatures , interchain ( interplane ) couplings come into play , and a full three - dimensional description is required .    in complex spin systems ,",
    "the identification of different energy scales is by no means a simple problem .",
    "naively , one could think that distinct crystallographic positions of magnetic atoms should lead to different strengths of magnetic couplings and , therefore , to different energy scales of the magnetic behavior .",
    "indeed , in spin - dimer systems , such as bacusi@xmath4o@xmath5 and nh@xmath1cucl@xmath0 , the spin-@xmath6 cu@xmath7 ions occupy several nonequivalent positions@xcite and form different types of spin dimers which have large impact on the high - field behavior , including the unusual critical regime of the bose - einstein condensation of magnons in bacusi@xmath4o@xmath5 ( refs .  ) and the fractional magnetization plateaus in nh@xmath1cucl@xmath0 ( refs .  ) .",
    "however , spin dimers can also be formed between two nonequivalent cu positions , thus leading to only one type of spin dimer and one energy scale , as in the spin - ladder compound bicu@xmath4po@xmath5.@xcite    when the system contains several cu@xmath7 positions with dissimilar local environment and variable connectivity of the cu polyhedra , the identification of relevant interactions and energy scales becomes increasingly complex .",

    "the intricate crystal structure of this mineral@xcite features three nonequivalent cu positions .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting spin lattice comprises only two types of magnetic dimers with notably different interaction energies .",
    "our microscopic analysis shows that one spin dimer is formed between two different cu positions ( cu1cu2 ) and does not match the respective structural dimer .",
    "however , the other spin dimer coincides with the cu3cu3 structural dimer .",
    "we argue that neither a straightforward comparison of cu ",
    "cu distances nor the application of the goodenough - kanamori - anderson ( gka ) rules for the superexchange@xcite lead to the correct assignment of magnetic couplings in clinoclase .",

    "hydrogen positions missing in the presently available crystallographic data@xcite were obtained by structural optimizations with a threshold for residual forces of 0.002  ev/.    the effects of strong electronic correlations , typical for cuprates , were considered by mapping the lda bands onto an effective tight - binding ( tb ) model .",

    "powder xrd confirmed the purity of our clinoclase sample .",
    "however , the icp - oes analysis showed slight deviations from the ideal composition : 49.6(3 )  wt.% cu , 18.3(1 )  wt.% as compared to 50.1(1 )  wt.% cu , 19.7(1 )  wt.% as expected for cu@xmath0(aso@xmath1)(oh)@xmath0 .",

    "the cuo@xmath1 plaquettes around the cu1 and cu2 sites form doubly bridged dimers ( d1 = cu1cu2 ) that share corners and build zigzag chains directed along [ 001 ] .",

    "when hydrogens are attached to oxygens belonging to the aso@xmath1 tetrahedra , the energy is much higher , hence such structures can be ruled out .",
