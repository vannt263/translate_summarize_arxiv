    "the two - dimensional ising lattice model is one of the simplest models of second - order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "this model has long played a fundamental role in statistical physics due its broad applicability and the availability of analytic solutions .",
    "previous studies have proven that the critical behavior of this model is universal to a large extent , depending on the essential symmetries inherent to the system  @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional ising lattice model is usually assigned to a flat plane . in the last two decades , however , there has been a growing interest in the nature of the ising model assigned to curved surfaces  @xcite .",
    "this interest is because of its relevance to quantum gravity theory  @xcite and the successful fabrication of magnetic nanostructures with curved geometries  @xcite . in general",
    ", the finite curvature of the underlying geometry may alter the geometric symmetries of the hamiltonian describing the system ; this alteration results in a qualitative change in the critical properties of the system . in fact , it has been reported @xcite that such curvature - induced alterations occur when the ising lattice is assigned to a surface with a constant negative curvature  @xcite .",
    "significant shifts in static and dynamic critical exponents toward the mean - field values were unveiled in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the mean - field property of the system was analytically proven by employing the renormalization group method  @xcite .",
    "the abovementioned findings led to the exploration of surface curvature effects in various kinds of statistical lattice models  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0-state potts model on the negatively curved surface exhibited a first - order phase transition when @xmath1 @xcite , and the xy model on the same surface showed the absence of kosterlitz - thouless transition due to strong spin - wave fluctuation  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the concept of negatively curved surfaces ( or spaces ) is also relevant in many fields where the geometric character underlying the system is of great significance , such as glass science  @xcite , plasma physics  @xcite , quantum transport  @xcite , chaos  @xcite , string theory  @xcite , and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "recently , baek _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the percolation transition in negatively curved lattices .",
    "they found two distinct percolation thresholds  one that corresponds to the occurrence of a single infinite - sized cluster and the other that corresponds to the occurrence of _ many _ infinite - sized clusters connecting a site deeply inside the lattice to that lying at the outmost boundary of the lattice .",
    "the latter threshold originates from an exponential increase in the total number of sites , @xmath2 , with the linear dimension of the lattice , @xmath3 ( for the definition of @xmath3 , see section ii in the present article ) .",
    "the exponential increase in @xmath4 leads to an important consequence : the ratio of the perimeter to the area of the lattice remains finite even within the thermodynamic limit @xmath5 .",
    "this result is in contrast with the case to that in the case of a flat plane , wherein @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ratio becomes zero for large values of @xmath3 .",
    "similar percolation thresholds have been observed in enhanced binary trees  @xcite whose lattice structure is quite analogous to that considered in ref .",
    "it is conjectured that the two - stage percolation transitions indicate the non - uniform ordering of the corresponding ising model ; that is , non - vanishing boundary effects even for large @xmath4 may cause spatially non - uniform growth of ferromagnetic ising domains under cooling , wherein the ordering process near the outmost boundary differs from that deep within the lattice .",
    "the precursor of such non - uniform growth was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the stable griffiths phase was found near the outmost boundary at a temperature lower than the mean - field transition temperature .    in the present article",
    ", we examine the ordering process of the negatively curved ising model at temperatures close to and far greater than the mean - field transition temperature in order to clarify the boundary - spin contributions to the domain growth and domain distribution during cooling . using monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we have proved that short - range order exists at temperatures far greater than the transition temperature .",
    "the existence of short - range order at such high temperatures is peculiar to the ising model of negatively curved surfaces and is thus an important consequence of non - zero boundary effects that are observed even in large systems .",

    "this section gives a brief summary on the construction of regular lattices on a surface with negative curvature .",
    "a surface with constant negative curvature can be defined as a single sheet of a two - sheeted hyperboloid expressed by @xmath9 which is constructed in the minkowski space endowed with the minkowskian metric @xmath10 .",
    "although this definition is exact , it is inconvenient for computations since three coordinates are used to describe a geometry that has only two degrees of freedom .",
    "we thus use an alternative representation of the surface  the poincar disk representation  that is obtained by projecting the upper hyperboloid sheet onto the @xmath11-@xmath12 plane by using the following mapping : @xmath13 as a result of this mapping , the upper hyperbolic sheet is transformed into a unit circle on the _ x - y _ plane endowed with the metric @xmath14 this unit circle is referred to as a poincar disk and serves as a convenient representation of the surface with a constant negative curvature .",
    "the gaussian curvature @xmath15 on the disk , which is obtained by  @xcite @xmath16 takes the value of @xmath17 at arbitrary points on the disk .",
    "the boundary of the disk corresponds to points at infinity in the hyperbolic plane .",
    "the horizontal axis represents the number of concentric layers of heptagons @xmath3 .",
    "inset : semi - logarithmic plot of @xmath18 vs. @xmath3 . ]    an infinite variety of regular polygonal lattices can be built on the poincar disk .",
    "all the lattices satisfy the relation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of edges of each polygon , and @xmath0 is the number of polygons around each vertex  @xcite .",
    "the heptagonal lattice of @xmath21 is considered in the present work .",
    "figure [ fig_01 ] shows the heptagonal lattice represented as a poincar disk .",
    "although polygons depicted in the figure appear to be distorted , all of them are exactly congruent with the metric given in eq .",
    "( [ eq_03 ] ) .",
    "the size of the entire lattice is characterized by the number of concentric layers of heptagons , denoted by @xmath3 , which effectively serves as the linear dimension of the lattice .        for a given @xmath3 , the total number of sites _",

    "the plot shows that @xmath4 increases exponentially for @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , we obtain @xmath26 which implies the boundary contribution quantified by @xmath27 does not become zero , but remains finite within the limit @xmath28 .",
    "it is emphasized that non - vanishing property of @xmath27 as well as the exponential increase in @xmath18 with @xmath3 is a result of the constant negative curvature of the underlying geometry , and it is the reason behind the non - trivial critical behavior of embedded lattices , as proved in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the current study aims at exploring the ordering mechanism of the heptagonal ising model with ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian of the heptagonal ising model is given by @xmath29where @xmath30 denotes a pair of nearest - neighbor sites on a lattice with free boundary conditions .",

    "are used as the units of temperature and energy , respectively .",
    "we have employed monte carlo simulations to calculate the order parameter @xmath33 and the two - point correlation function @xmath34 with @xmath35 . here , @xmath36 represents the location of the @xmath37th spin on the poincar disk , and the distance @xmath38 is a measure of the number of bonds along the shortest path between the @xmath37th and @xmath39th sites .",
    "configuration space sampling has been carried out by using a cluster - flip algorithm  @xcite , and averages have been calculated by considering @xmath40 samples .",
    "figure [ fig_03 ] shows the temperature dependence of @xmath41 for different @xmath38 s . we have set @xmath42 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath43 ) in all calculations .",
    "we found that for @xmath44 , @xmath45 shows power - law decay with @xmath46 and thus survive at @xmath47 @xcite though @xmath48 is almost zero there .",
    "these survival of @xmath45 indicates that small - sized ferromagnetic domains remain active even at high temperatures , although they do not contribute to @xmath48 because of the change in sign between positive ( @xmath49 ) and negative ( @xmath50 ) domains . to explore the variety of domain sizes and examine boundary effects on size variations",
    ", we evaluate the correlation function , which is denoted by @xmath51 , of two spins that lie in the @xmath3th layer .",
    "figure [ fig_03](b ) shows the @xmath46-dependence of @xmath52 for @xmath53 , in which @xmath3 is varied from @xmath54 to @xmath55 ( data for @xmath56 are omitted since they are indistinguishable from data for @xmath57 ) .",
    "interestingly , the data of @xmath52 for each @xmath38 value collapses onto a single curve at @xmath58 .",
    "this collapse implies that the domains that continue to exist at @xmath58 are of the same size and are uniformly scattered over the entire lattice , regardless of their distance from the outmost boundary .",
    "it is emphasized that the persistence of domains at such high temperatures is supplementary to previous findings  @xcite related to low - temperature behaviors of an identical system .",
    "it was found that at @xmath59 , the central region of the lattice ( far from the outmost boundary ) exhibits an ordered phase that is a consequence of a mean - field transition  @xcite , while the outer region ( close to the boundary ) exhibits a stabilized griffiths phase that is free from extrinsic disorder  @xcite .",
    "note that the former result indicates the presence of a paramagnetic phase in the central region at @xmath60 , where ising spins are randomly oriented due to large thermal fluctuations .",
    "hence , one would expect the formation of ferromagnetic domains to be hindered at @xmath60 ; however , contrary to the expectation , the formation is observed in the current simulations .",
    "this apparent contradiction is attributed to the finite - size effect . for a moderagely large @xmath3 ,",
    "the strong boundary - spin contributions penetrate to the center of the lattice , as a result of which small - sized domains arise not only near the boundary but also in the central region .",
    "we conjecture that the domain in the central region disappears if a sufficiently large value of @xmath3 is considered : however , huge computational costs are involved when the value of @xmath3 is large enough .     within a circular region @xmath61 enclosed by the @xmath3th layer . ]    to gain a better insight into the above issue , we evaluate the quantity @xmath62 , where @xmath61 is a circular region enclosed by the @xmath3th layer .",
    "figure [ fig_04 ] shows the @xmath46-dependence of @xmath63 for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "it is found that above @xmath64 , @xmath63 for @xmath65 is finite whereas @xmath48 becomes almost zero .",
    "this indicates an incomplete cancellation between the positive and negative domains in the region @xmath66 due to its small size .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath63 should become zero if @xmath61 is in the paramagnetic phase with no finite - sized domains .",
    "therefore , the finiteness of @xmath67 at @xmath60 is another piece of evidence that supports the persistence of small - sized domains .",
    "we have also confirmed that finite @xmath67 at high @xmath46 tends to disappear with an increase in @xmath3 , since boundary - spin contributions are prevented from penetrating to the center of the lattice .",
    "figure [ fig_05 ] illustrates the ordering process of our moderately large ising lattice with a decrease in the temperature . at @xmath68 , small - sized ferromagnetic domains ( indicated by open and solid circles )",
    "are randomly embedded in the paramagnetic phase which is shown in gray .",
    "these domains are distributed homogeneously across the lattice , but give rise to finite @xmath69 for small values of @xmath3 due to the incomplete cancellation between the positive and negative domains .",
    "subsequently , a decrease in @xmath46 results in the growth of domains within the inner region .",
    "eventually , the ferromagnetic phase is formed through the mean - field phase transition . nevertheless , near the outmost boundary",
    ", small domains remain active and fluctuate on a large time scale , as observed in ref .",
    "in the present work , we have considered the ordering mechanism of the ising lattice model assigned to a negatively curved surface .",
    "we have found that small - sized domains survive at temperatures much higher than @xmath70 , at which the inner bulk region of the lattice goes through mean - field phase transition .",
    "the existence of small domains is attributed to the non - zero boundary - spin contribution that is unique to negatively curved surfaces .",
