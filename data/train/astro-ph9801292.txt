    "1997 ; cochran et al . 1997 ; noyes et al .",
    "1997 ) of extra - solar planets have revitalized discussions on the theory of planetary system formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , several of these planets are found to be on the order of a jupiter - mass ( @xmath0 g ) or greater , and in very close proximity to their central stars ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "previous to the discoveries of planetary companions in very small orbits , it was predicted that jupiter - type planets would form ( and , by implication , exist ) only at or outside of the ice line ( 3  -  5au ) ( boss 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , although close giant planet formation may be theoretically possible ( wuchterl 1993 , 1996 ) , this requires the initial formation of a solid core of at least 5 to 10 earth masses which may be difficult to achieve very close to the parent star .",
    "it is therefore most likely that jupiters can not form at small heliocentric distances ( see also boss 1995 ; guillot et al .",
    "1996 ) , which thus leaves the question : how did the observed massive close companions to several stars get to their current locations ?",
    "jupiter - mass planets can migrate inward from their formation locations ( see , for example , goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; ward & hourigan 1989 ; lin & papaloizou 1986 ; lin & papaloizou 1993 ; lin , bodenheimer , & richardson 1996 ) .",
    "we consider under what physical conditions planets may migrate inward , and how , where , why , and when a planet will stop its inward migration . rather than",
    "consider catastrophic interactions among more than one planet ( weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ; rasio & ford 1996 ) , we model isolated massive planets which smoothly migrate as a result of the net torques on the body .",
    "we find three broad classes for massive planets : ( i ) planets which migrate inward very quickly and disappear due to mass loss from roche lobe overflow ; ( ii ) planets which migrate inward , lose some but not all of their mass , and stably survive at small heliocentric distances ; and ( iii ) planets which do not lose any mass during migration .",
    "some planets in class iii move radially only a small distance from their formation locations . in the context of this picture",
    ", massive close companions can result from a variety of initial conditions , and form a population which overlaps with and includes the detected close companion population .",
    "our distribution of final masses and heliocentric distances predicts that massive planets can be present at any heliocentric distance between their formation locations and extremely small orbits , and we predict that as detection sensitivities increase , massive planets will be found to have an almost continuous distribution of heliocentric distances , from a fraction of an au all the way out to the ice line or beyond .",
    "our general model is to sum up the torques on a planet and find its radial motion in the circumstellar disk .",
    "we compute , in a one dimensional model , torques on a planet due to disk interactions ( inward for the parameters which we adopt ) ; torques on a planet due to interactions with the rapidly - spinning star ( outward ) ; and torques on the planet due to mass loss onto the star ( outward for the conservative mass transfer case ) . sections [ disk ] , [ tides ] , and [ massloss ] , respectively , describe the calculation of these torques and the resulting radial motions . these torques must be calculated numerically in order to combine the results in a self - consistent model . in section",
    "[ results ] , we present the results of adding these torques together and calculating the orbital evolution of massive planets .",
    "our work is the first to quantitatively and self - consistently consider these three torques and the problem of extrasolar planets .",
    "lastly , in section [ discussion ] we discuss our results .",
    "section [ conclusions ] provides conclusions and predictions .",
    "our model begins , at time = 0 , with a fully formed gaseous giant planet of a given mass at a given heliocentric distance .",
    "the circumstellar disk is assumed to have smooth , power - law radial density and temperature profiles , and to be axisymmetric .",
    "jupiter - mass planets may require most of the lifetime of the disk to accrete ( @xmath1 to @xmath2years ) ( pollack et al .",
    "1996 ; zuckerman , forveille , & kastner 1995 ) .",
    "however , we incorporate this possibility in our model by allowing some disks to dissipate during the planet s migration , thus letting the effective disk lifetime ( @xmath3 ) be the actual disk lifetime minus the time to form the planet , and consider this quantity to be the limiting time constraint .",
    "when an accreting planet has sufficient mass , it will form a gap in its disk ; gap formation terminates the accretion process . in all interesting cases in this study , the gap forms quickly . therefore , starting with a fully formed giant planet in a disk with an initial smooth density distribution is adequate and appropriate .",
    "we solve for the one - dimensional ( radial ) movement of massive planets .",
    "the orbits are assumed to be keplerian and circular at all times .",
    "we model a thin axisymmetric disk with radial temperature and initial surface density profiles given by power - laws with exponents -1/2 and -3/2 , respectively ( takeuchi , miyama , & lin , 1996 ) .",
    "our nominal circumstellar disk has the following physical parameters : @xmath4 equal to @xmath5 , where @xmath4 is the usual disk viscosity parameter defined by @xmath6 , in which @xmath7 is the viscosity in the disk , @xmath8 is the keplerian angular velocity at a given heliocentric distance , and @xmath9 is the sound speed ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) ; @xmath10 ( beckwith & sargent 1993 ) ; and scale height equal to 0.05au at 5.2au ( takeuchi et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we take the nominal effective lifetime of the disk to be @xmath2years , based on observations ( zuckerman et al .",
    "1995 ) , with a range of @xmath1 to @xmath2years .",
    "all of these physical parameters are varied from their nominal values to model disks with different properties .    a massive planet and the circumstellar disk interact tidally which results in angular momentum transfer between the disk and the planet ( e.g. , goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; lin & papaloizou 1986 , 1993 ; ward & hourigan 1989 ; takeuchi et al . 1996 ;",
    "ward 1997a ; ward 1997b ) .",
    "the planet s motion in the disk excites density waves both interior and exterior to the planet .",
    "these waves create a gap in the disk as the planet clears material from its orbit .",
    "the size of the gap depends on the viscosity of the disk and inversely on the mass of the planet ( lin & papaloizou 1986 ; takeuchi et al .",
    "1996 ; see eqs .",
    "[ dadt_disk ] - [ sigma ] , below ) .",
    "the magnitude of the torque depends on the amount of disk material present near the planet , and thus on the size of the gap .",
    "torques on the planet are caused by gravitational interactions between the planet and density waves which occupy lindblad resonances in the disk .",
    "we simplify the problem by adopting the impulse approximation of lin & papaloizou ( 1986 ) , in which dissipation of the density waves is assumed to be local and angular momentum is deposited close to the planet through dissipative phenomenon such as shocks .",
    "the local dissipation approximation is reasonable because the disk which is nearest the planet has the largest influence in causing a torque on the planet .",
    "the accuracy and validity of this approximation is discussed at the end of this section .",
    "the radial motion of a planet in a circumstellar disk , due to interactions with the disk , is given by    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the heliocentric distance of the planet ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the masses of the central star and the planet , respectively ; @xmath15 is the radial coordinate , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the inner and outer boundaries of the disk , respectively ; @xmath18 is the injection rate of angular momentum per unit mass into the disk due to interactions between the disk and the planet ; and @xmath19 is the surface density of the disk ( lin & papaloizou 1986 ) .",
    "note that the radial motion of the planet is inversely proportional to the mass of the planet , so that more massive planets move less rapidly . the angular momentum injection rate for the impulse approximation with local dissipation is also taken from lin & papaloizou ( 1986 ) :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is a constant of order unity",
    ", @xmath22 is the mass ratio between the planet and the star ( @xmath23 ) , and @xmath24 is equal to the greater of @xmath25 or @xmath26 , where @xmath25 is the scale height of the disk . we solve for @xmath19 in equation  [ dadt_disk ] with a fully implicit solution to the continuity equation for the disk rewritten as ( lin & papaloizou 1986 )    @xmath27 . \\label{sigma}\\ ] ]    we take the density equal to zero in the innermost zone of the disk to represent material from the inner boundary of the disk falling onto the star .",
    "thus , we solve for @xmath19(r ) and @xmath18(r ) and then compute the integral in equation  [ dadt_disk ] to find the radial motion of the planet .",
    "the gap formed by the planet in the disk is crucial in determining the behavior of the system .",
    "figure  [ gap ] shows gap size in the disk as a function of initial planetary mass .",
    "the gap is defined as the region in which the surface density is less than half of what it would be if there were no planet in the disk .",
    "this figure compares our results ( circles ) , using the local dissipation approximation of lin & papaloizou ( 1986 ) , against results using the more computationally intensive wkb approximation of takeuchi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( shown as squares ) . for each model , @xmath4 s of @xmath5 and @xmath28 are shown .",
    "the impulse approximation which we use closely reproduces gap formations found with the more complex scheme ; therefore our simplifying assumption is valid .",
    "the time `` snapshot '' shown in figure  [ gap ] is @xmath29years , a time after the gap has fully formed but before the planet has started to migrate significantly from its initial location .",
    "the disk continues to evolve after this time , and as the planet moves inward , the gap created by the planet moves inward as well .",
    "the inner edge of the gap is continually eroded , and the outer edge fills in viscously , as the planet moves inward . note that larger viscosities cause smaller gaps and therefore faster inward migration ;",
    "larger diskmasses also cause smaller gaps and subsequently more rapid inward migration .",
    "we assume that the circumstellar disk dissipates after @xmath30years , based on observational evidence ( zuckerman et al .",
    "1995 ) . in our model , we do not attempt to model the exact physics of disk dissipation . instead",
    ", we simply assume that , as a local phenomenon , the disk has disappeared from regions close to the planet after this time . in terms of the behavior of a planet ,",
    "only the local disk is important , and disk - clearing processes elsewhere do not affect the behavior of the planet .",
    "however , in future work , we intend to model disk dissipation explicitly .",
    "as a migrating planet gets close to its central star , tidal bulges raised on the star by the planet become important to the net radial motion of the planet . because stars are dissipative ,",
    "the stellar tidal bulge is not aligned with the line of the centers of mass of the star and the planet ( goldreich & soter 1966 ; stacey 1977 ; hubbard 1984 ) . in most cases",
    ", our model planets do not migrate to separations smaller than the co - rotation point with the rapidly rotating star ; therefore , we assume that in all cases , the star is rotating faster than the orbital period of the planet , so that the tidal bulge leads the line of centers .",
    "the torque on the planet in this case is in the outward sense , and the planet slows the rotation rate of the star , as is the case with the earth - moon system . as energy is dissipated within the star and the star slows down , the planet must move outward to conserve angular momentum .",
    "the radial motion of the planet due to spin torque interaction with the star is given by    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the keplerian angular velocity of the planet , @xmath33 is the stellar radius , and @xmath34 is the tidal dissipation factor of the star ( goldreich & soter 1966 ; lin et al .",
    "the numerical coefficient is from the expression for body of uniform density ; however , departures from this can be incorporated into uncertainties in @xmath34 ( see below ) . including the effects of infall of material onto the star and the release of energy from gravitational contraction , the stellar radius decreases from early times until @xmath2years with the following function :    @xmath35^{-\\frac{1}{3 } } \\label{rstar}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath37 is the surface temperature of the star ( taken to be 4600k ) , @xmath38 is elapsed time since the star completed its accretion , and @xmath39 is the star s initial radius , taken to be four times the sun s current radius ( cameron 1995 ) .",
    "the dissipation factor @xmath40 describes how efficiently rotational energy is dissipated by friction within an object ( hubbard 1984 ; rasio et al .",
    "we use a value of @xmath41 for @xmath34 ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ) , and a range of @xmath42 to @xmath43 , for a pre - main sequence star . by comparison",
    ", jupiter has @xmath44 in the range @xmath45 to @xmath46 ( hubbard 1984 ) , and a main sequence star has @xmath47 . for smaller @xmath34",
    "s , the star dissipates energy less efficiently , and the ( outward ) tidal torque on the planet is greater than is the case for larger @xmath34 s .",
    "we adopt a spin - down time for the star of @xmath48years , since after this time , the star s rotation rate has decreased by roughly an order of magnitude from its rapidly rotating state ( skumanich 1972 ) .",
    "the effect of different spindown timescales , from @xmath30 to @xmath49years , on the results of the model is small .",
    "the tidal torque is essentially off after @xmath49years due to the star s higher @xmath34 and slower rotation rate . in fact , all systems with close companions ( with the exception of the tidally locked @xmath50 boo system ) are still evolving dynamically due to tidal torques between the bodies , but the orbital decay time for 51  peg  b , for example , is more than @xmath51years ( rasio et al . 1996 ) , much longer than the main sequence lifetime of the star , so we do not include this late orbital evolution in our model .",
    "tidal heating of the planet is caused by tidal bulges raised on the planet due to the star , the same mechanism which produces outward tidal torques on the planet .",
    "significant heating of a planet due to external torques would alter its internal structure and behavior and therefore be important in the mass overflow regime .",
    "the tidal heating rate of the planet is given by lunine & tittemore ( 1993 ) as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the energy input to the planet due to tidal heating , @xmath54 is the planet s love number ( @xmath55 0.5 ( hubbard 1984 ) ) , @xmath56 is the orbital mean motion , @xmath57 is the eccentricity of the orbit , and @xmath58 is the obliquity . for a planet with a four - day period and @xmath57",
    "= 0.1 and @xmath58 = 0 , the heat energy input is @xmath59ergs / sec . since a jupiter - mass planet in such a close orbit would have luminosity @xmath60ergs / sec ( see figure  [ hr ] ) , we find that tidal heating of a close planetary companion is negligible .",
    "when a migrating planet gets sufficiently close to its primary star , the planet s radius can exceed its roche radius . when this occurs , mass transfer from the planet to the star takes place . during transfer",
    ", the planet moves outward to conserve the angular momentum of the system . in the case of stable mass transfer",
    ", the planet moves to a distance at which its planetary radius is equal to the roche radius .",
    "therefore , the distance to which the planet will move is determined by the planetary radius , and hence is a function of the intrinsic properties of the planet : its age , temperature , and mass .",
    "the planets in our model are not point masses , but have radii and internal structures that are calculated at each location and time through the planet s evolution .",
    "a grid of quasi - static evolution models was calculated as described in guillot et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . for a given composition , the radius of a planet ( @xmath61 ) is a function of its mass @xmath62 , its equilibrium temperature @xmath63 and time @xmath38 .",
    "the grid was calculated for 0.4@xmath64 , @xmath65k , and for a few billion years , starting from an initial extended planet of about 16 jupiter radii ( @xmath66 ) at @xmath67 .",
    "when the incoming stellar heat is redistributed equally over the entire atmosphere of the planet , the equilibrium temperature is related to the orbital distance by :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the bond albedo of the planet and @xmath70 is the stellar luminosity . for simplicity , we assume @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( @xmath73erg / sec ) .",
    "of course , any uncertainty on @xmath69 is equivalent to an uncertainty on @xmath70 ( except in the limit @xmath74 ) .",
    "the effect of those is discussed below .",
    "the effective temperature of the planet is defined by the equation    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the intrinsic luminosity of the planet , and is a function of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath38 .",
    "the time variable is inappropriate as a conserved quantity during mass loss calculations because the interior of the planet and the orbital evolution are not coupled , and because a time origin can not be defined in an absolute way .",
    "heliocentric distance is not a useful conserved quantity either , since @xmath12 changes while the planet moves .",
    "therefore , although the radius of the planet is , in general , @xmath77 , when considering continuous mass loss from a planet , we use @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the specific entropy ( entropy per unit mass ) .",
    "planetary mass , temperature , and entropy are continuous variables over which the grid of models can be both interpolated and differentiated ; temperature and entropy are both conserved during mass loss events .",
    "the grid of models has minimum mass of 0.4@xmath80 ; therefore , planets are considered to have lost all their mass and disappeared when @xmath81 . note that none of our planets therefore ever enter a regime in which the planetary core is involved in mass transfer .",
    "the core would be made of solid ( rocky ) material , and behave very differently in a mass transfer regime ; we intend to study this behavior in future work .",
    "the conservation of the specific entropy at the center of the planet during mass - loss events is exact in the case of a fully convective planet , as long as the atmosphere can adjust to the new equilibrium on a time scale much shorter than the mass loss time scale .",
    "this is generally the case since for @xmath82k and pressure @xmath83bar the heat capacity is @xmath84erg / kg and the rosseland mean opacity is @xmath85 , so that the radiative diffusivity can be estimated as :    @xmath86    therefore , the corresponding time scale is @xmath87years , using @xmath88 cm ( about 1% of the planetary radius ) .",
    "this is smaller than the mass loss time scale since it takes about @xmath89 to @xmath29years to lose about 1% of the planetary mass by roche lobe overflow ( see below ) .",
    "however , planets in very close orbit do not generally stay fully convective but develop an inner radiative zone due to a strong ( and unavoidable ) decrease of their internal luminosity ( see guillot et al . 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "the entropy is therefore larger at the top than at the bottom of the radiative zone . as a result , not only the atmosphere but",
    "also the inner radiative zone have to adjust to the new equilibrium .",
    "the previous time scale estimation , now estimated using twice the temperature and a mean pressure of 100bar , yields a @xmath90 which is @xmath91300 times larger ( assuming the same characteristic opacity ) , or about 100years .",
    "this is close to the mass loss characteristic time scale : non - equilibrium effects may therefore be significant .",
    "we will neglect them in the present work , thereby somewhat underestimating the extent of mass loss by roche lobe overflow .",
    "other sources of uncertainty are expected to be more significant , as discussed hereafter .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty in the calculation of the internal structure and evolution of the planets and therefore on the presence and magnitude of mass loss torques is due to the inaccurate representation of the atmospheres of these objects . in our calculations ,",
    "mass loss always occurs when the planet is very close to its parent star .",
    "the incoming stellar heat flux is then very significant , and the intrinsic luminosity of the planet comparatively very small .",
    "interior and atmospheric models are coupled using a relation linking the effective temperature to the temperature at a given pressure level ( see e.g. saumon et al .",
    "this relation is based on atmospheric models calculated assuming _ no _ incoming stellar flux , and is equivalent to assuming that the stellar flux ( mostly emitted at short wavelength ) is absorbed deep in the atmosphere .",
    "although it is not totally unrealistic ( and it is the best that can be done at the moment ) , the resulting @xmath77 relation is very uncertain ( i.e. , the accuracy on the partial derivative @xmath92 is probably only about a factor two ) , thus affecting when mass loss occurs and how much mass is effectively lost by the planet .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the radii are defined at the 10bar level , and that `` hot jupiters '' might have extended atmospheres , so that the effective radius of the planet is slightly larger than estimated here , although the amount of mass contained in the extreme upper atmosphere is small .    finally , the uncertainty in @xmath69 and @xmath70 will tend to shift the orbital distances at which mass loss occurs .",
    "for example , a stellar luminosity of @xmath93 causes a planet to lose mass at a larger heliocentric distance than for the nominal case .",
    "the result is that in the @xmath93 case , the planet s final mass is smaller than for the same initial mass planet in the nominal disk .",
    "however , we stress that refinements in the treatment of planetary atmospheres will not affect the qualitative behavior of the system , although the exact values of mass and distance at which mass loss occurs may change with improvements in planetary atmosphere models .",
    "the roche lobe overflow regime begins at the distance where the planet s radius is equal to or greater than its roche lobe radius .",
    "the roche radius is given by the following ( eggleton 1983 ) :    @xmath94    for stable mass transfer in which material from the planet is transferred inward onto the central star , the mass loss rate due to roche lobe overflow of a planet is determined by and balances the net inward torque , and is given by    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the orbital angular momentum of the planet , and where    @xmath97    ( cameron & iben 1986 ; benz et al .",
    "the derivative of the planetary radius with respect to time in equation  [ massloss1 ] is at constant mass , but allows heliocentric distance and age to change .",
    "since temperature is a function of distance and entropy is the time variable , we have    @xmath98    the planetary radius partial differentials come from our grid of atmosphere models ; @xmath99 comes from the evolution models as well ; @xmath100 comes from equation  [ teq ] ; and @xmath101 is the planet s radial motion from the sum of disk and tidal torques .",
    "the remaining parameters in equation  [ massloss2 ] are    @xmath102    for @xmath103 from equation  [ roche ] ; and the parameter @xmath104 , which is the exponent in the mass - radius relation , and should not be confused with the disk viscosity @xmath4 .",
    "the mass - radius relation exponent @xmath104 , which is the derivative of planetary radius with respect to planetary mass at constant temperature and entropy , is given by    @xmath105    we calculate @xmath104 from our grid of atmosphere evolution and structure models .",
    "note that @xmath104 in this work is defined differently than in cameron & iben ( 1986 ) and benz et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , by a minus sign .    in the mass - age - temperature regime",
    "in which we consider mass loss ( planets with @xmath106 , temperature  @xmath107  1000k , and age less than @xmath48years ) , a planet instantaneously losing mass at constant t and s expands . in order to conserve the angular momentum of the system ,",
    "a planet which loses mass to its primary must move outward .",
    "a planet losing mass is pushed outward while @xmath108 , and the planet will lose mass until    @xmath109    where the primes refer to values at the planet s new mass and heliocentric distance . since the roche radius is proportional to heliocentric distance ( eq .  [ roche ] ) , any subsequent inward motion of the planet decreases the roche radius further , which results in more mass loss from the planet . since the circumstellar disk provides a torque which pushes the planet inward , as long as the disk is present , mass loss proceeds continuously at the planetary roche radius , once it has started .",
    "the planet will continue to lose mass and move to larger and larger heliocentric distances to conserve angular momentum .",
    "the timescale for mass loss from the planet onto the star can be quite short , a few times @xmath1 years or less .",
    "when the disk dissipates , the inward torque goes to zero , and the mass loss stops . if a planet is in the process of losing mass when the disk dissipates , mass loss will cease , and the planet will be stranded at a distance where @xmath103 = @xmath61 , with @xmath110 .",
    "the model stops during the mass loss regime when the planet s mass becomes less than 0.4 @xmath111 , or when the model stops converging during mass loss , typically as the mass approaches 0.4 @xmath111 .",
    "the general approach involves studying the evolution of a planet with time and distance . specifically , we sum up the torques on a planet at a given time and distance , and solve for the planet s motion from this sum of torques .",
    "the torques are due to interactions with the disk ( inward ) ; due to the spin of the star ( outward ) ; and due to mass loss ( outward ) .",
    "additionally , at every time and distance , we solve for the planet s radius .",
    "there are several major stages in a planet s migration . the first stage , which lasts from formation time ( time zero ) for @xmath112years , is the inward migration stage .",
    "the only important torques on the planet arise from disk interactions .",
    "the second stage occurs if or when a planet reaches a small enough heliocentric distance for spin ( tidal ) torques to become important , in addition to disk torques .",
    "this second stage can last for @xmath1 to @xmath2years . in this stage ,",
    "inward torques from the disk are somewhat offset by outward torques from interactions with the spinning star .",
    "a third stage , which not all planets reach , begins when the planet s radius exceeds the roche radius , and the planet starts to lose mass .",
    "the onset of mass loss replaces inward motion with outward motion .",
    "this third stage is short because mass loss is rapid , but if it occurs close to t  =  @xmath2years , it is possible that the disk may dissipate while the planet is losing mass , thus leaving a planetary remnant at a small heliocentric distance . stage four corresponds to times between @xmath2 and @xmath48years , when a planet may be subject to outward torques due to star ( spin ) tides , but neither disk nor mass loss torques are present .",
    "planets can therefore only move outward during this stage .",
    "finally , the last stage is after @xmath48years , after which spin torques also turn off , and only very small late stage migration may occur .",
    "this late stage migration is also due to tidal interactions between the star and the planet , but for most planets , occurs on a timescale longer than the age of a main - sequence star ( rasio et al .",
    "1996 ) , and is negligible .",
    "we do not consider this late - stage tidal migration in our model .",
    "there exist three broad classes of fates for migrating planets . in class",
    "i , planets migrate inward very rapidly and lose all their mass onto the star by roche lobe overflow . planets in class ii migrate to small heliocentric distances and lose some , but not all , of their mass onto the central star .",
    "these planets are losing mass when the disk dissipates , terminating mass transfer from the planet .",
    "these planets survive until @xmath113years at small heliocentric distances and masses smaller than their initial masses .",
    "planets in class iii do not lose any mass during their evolution .",
    "the more massive of these planets do not migrate very far , and reside at distances very close to their formation locations .",
    "the nominal case for our model has the following values for the variable parameters : @xmath114 ( takeuchi et al . 1996 ) ; diskmass  = @xmath115 ( beckwith & sargent 1993 ) ; @xmath116years ( zuckerman et al . 1995 ) ; @xmath117years ( skumanich 1972 ) ; and @xmath118 ( lin et al .",
    "all of these parameters were varied in turn to determine which physical parameters are most important to the evolution and migration of a planet .",
    "table [ nominalmass ] shows the results of planets with different initial masses in the nominal disk .",
    "the boundaries between the different classes are shown quite clearly , as planets with initial masses @xmath119 are class i planets , which lose all their mass ; planets with initial masses @xmath120 are class ii planets which lose some of their mass but survive to @xmath113years ; and planets with initial masses @xmath121 are class iii planets which do not lose any mass",

    "this critical mass range spans initial masses from 3.37 to 3.40@xmath80 , inclusive . in all cases",
    ", the critical mass range would be broader if the mass loss rate from the planets were slower .",
    "a smaller mass loss rate would result from smaller net inward torques , reducing the @xmath123 term ; or from a planet s having a modified internal structure , thus changing the @xmath124 term ( in eq .  [ massloss1 ] ) .",
    "see the discussion section for further discussion on the width of the critical mass range .",
    "some insight is gained by examining the evolution of migrating planets on a hertzsprung - russell diagram ( figure  [ hr ] ) .",
    "in such a diagram , one can easily see the stages of evolution of a migrating planet . at early times , the evolution of a migrating massive planet is dominated by contraction of the giant planet , during which time the evolution track follows the boundary of the hayashi ( fully convective ) region .",
    "the first stage of migration comes next , representing a time during which the planet has roughly constant radius but increasing effective temperature as the planet moves closer to its star .",
    "the second stage of planetary migration , when the planet is affected by torques from the star , is also part of the increasing effective temperature ( i.e. , inward ) progression in the hr diagram .",
    "the third stage of migration , due to mass loss , is outward motion , seen in an hr diagram as decreasing effective temperature . during mass loss ,",
    "the planet s radius is increasing .",
    "the fourth stage of evolution follows the cessation of mass loss , during which time the planet again cools and its luminosity decreases while at moving to lower effective temperatures ( larger heliocentric distances ) due to the remaining tidal ( star ) torques .",
    "lastly , all the external torques vanish , and the planet continues to contract and become less luminous , at constant @xmath125 .    figure [ all_ma ] compares the final masses and heliocentric distances of our migrating planets , for various parameter combinations , with those of the recently detected observations of extra - solar planets .",
    "this is not meant to be a complete parameter study , but rather focuses in particular on cases interesting to extrasolar planets and to jupiter .",
    "there are no class i planets in this figure , since they all lose all their mass onto the star and do not survive .",
    "class ii planets ( open circles ) are shown , and are similar to 51  peg  b and @xmath126  and  b. class iii , planets which do not lose any mass during their evolution , comprises the remaining planets , and reproduces @xmath50  boo  b , 55  cnc  b , @xmath127  crb  b , 47  uma  b , and jupiter .",
    "these planets may not have migrated far , and jupiter has probably moved radially @xmath128 1au from its formation location .",
    "not shown are the extrasolar planets with high eccentricities ( 16  cyg  bb , 70  vir  b , hd  114762  b ) , as our model does not produce planets in highly eccentric orbits . in these systems , it is likely that some post - migration dynamical processing has taken place ( e.g. , cochran et al .",
    "1997 ; lin & ida 1997 ) .",
    "the slight positive slope at small heliocentric distances is suggestive of an `` inner limit , '' and is caused by the outward tidal torque , which is active after the other torques have vanished .",
    "there are three parallel trends with this slight positive slope , corresponding to the three different @xmath34 values used in our study .",
    "the magnitude of the tidal torque is proportional to @xmath62 ( eq .  [ dadt_star ] ) , producing the positive slope .",
    "systems in which the tidal torque is active long after the other torques , and which have @xmath34 within the range considered in this work , should not have planets inward of this `` inner limit , '' and this late tidal evolution has the effect of erasing any locational signatures of previous evolutionary stages .",
    "the preponderance of models which have final masses of 1@xmath111 reflects an excess of model runs with this initial mass , in order to study jupiter s evolution .",
    "the curving trends of planets at @xmath129 and @xmath107 1au represent planets which are massive enough to clear their disks before they can migrate inward very far .",
    "more massive planets clear their disks more quickly , so that the most massive planet in our models , 13@xmath80 , has a final heliocentric distance which is only a few percent different than its starting position . in general , more massive planets do not move as far , although we have several examples of large ( @xmath1075@xmath111 ) planets at small heliocentric distances , due to migrations is disks with varying diskmasses or viscosities .",
    "we find that a model of migrating planets can explain the presence and locations of not only the close companions ( at @xmath130 0.1 au ) , but also reasonably reproduces other observed planets , including jupiter . in the cases of a class ii planets",
    ", the ultimate planet may be only some 15% of its initial mass .",
    "we further find that the observed extrasolar planets represent a subset of possible outcomes of migrating planets . because of the steepness of the slope of @xmath131 in the class ii regime ( see figure  [ mfmi ] ) , very small changes in initial mass in the class ii mass range result in large differences in final mass .",
    "moreover , as can be seen in figure  [ all_ma ] , there is a tendency for planets from both classes ii and iii to end up at small heliocentric distances ( 0.03 to 0.05au ) .",
    "this result is caused by two separate physical mechanisms : class ii planets are moving away from the central star as they lose mass .",
    "class iii planets are still moving inward at the time when the disk vanishes .",
    "therefore , the range of initial masses which have small final heliocentric distances is broader than the critical mass range , as some planets from class iii , as well as all planets from class ii , can end up at small heliocentric distances . the result is a `` piling up '' of final planets at small heliocentric distances : planets with a fairly wide range of initial masses can all end up at small orbital separations .",
    "the presence of several detected planets at small masses and small heliocentric distances may imply geneses in disks with similar physical characteristics ; or it may be the result of preferentially ending up at small heliocentric distances , despite somewhat different initial conditions .",
    "we can not distinguish between these possibilities with the current model .",
    "however , from figure  [ all_ma ] , we observe that there seems to be a cutoff , in both heliocentric distance and final mass , between class ii and class iii planets",
    ". there are no class ii planets , in @xmath132 space , outside the boundaries defined by final masses @xmath133 and final separations @xmath134 0.05au ; and there are no class iii planets within that range .",
    "this segregation is found over a wide range of disk parameters .",
    "therefore , we suggest that observed planets within this region likely are class ii planets , having lost some but not all of their mass . certainly , with exactly the correct disk parameters , class iii planets could exist in this region .",
    "however , for our fairly wide coverage of parameter space , we do not find _ any _ class iii planets at small heliocentric distances and small masses , similar to 51 peg b and @xmath126 and b. therefore , we believe that our model , with the three important torques included , is relevant and important in understanding the evolution of some of the extra - solar planets , in that these two planets fall within the region where mass loss almost certainly is important . future observations of extrasolar planets may well allow us to constrain some disk and star parameters .",
    "our model spans a large part of multi - dimensional parameter space , as we have five major physical parameters which can affect the fates of migrating planets .",
    "we have examined the statistical results for various slices through our five - dimensional parameter space .",
    "regardless of which slice ( comparing diskmasses , viscosities , etc . ) is chosen , for all samples of reasonable size , the statistical results are roughly equivalent , another measure of the importance and validity of our model .",
    "we find that , for planets with initial integral masses between 1 and 5 @xmath111 , approximately half of the planets lose all their mass onto the central star ( class i planets ) , and approximately half survive ( class ii or iii ) .",
    "typically , a few percent of planets end up as class ii planets , which have lost some mass .",
    "the fact that half the initial planets lose all their mass may imply that half the normal - type , giant planet forming systems have lost planets onto their central stars . of the planets that survive , between one quarter and one third typically have heliocentric distances greater than 1au .",
    "therefore , while jupiter is consequently not a special case , it is also not the most probable outcome .",
    "the percent of planets ( class ii or iii ) which end up at small heliocentric distances ( @xmath1300.1 au ) is 3 - 5% .",
    "we find it intriguing that this rate of producing companions at small heliocentric distances is similar to the rate of discovering planets at small heliocentric distances ( marcy & butler 1997 ) .",
    "our model predicts that one quarter to one third of giant planet forming systems should have jupiters at @xmath107 1au ; this percentage is much higher than the observational success rate for planets in large heliocentric orbits .",
    "however , jupiter - mass planets in large ( @xmath915au ) orbits are the most difficult to detect with radial velocity searches , and in many cases are beyond detection . however , in the near future , better techniques on bigger telescopes should provide improved data sets in this range , and higher observational success rates can be expected .",
    "planets in our theoretical model fall into one of three classes , depending their mass loss .",
    "however , from the standpoint of observers and observables , any class iii planet at a small heliocentric distance would be indistinguishable ( at this time ) from a class ii planet at the same distance and mass .",
    "although these two planets have had very different evolutions , their observable characteristics ( e.g. , mass and heliocentric distance ) would be quite similar .",
    "therefore , in terms of observations , the most sensible classes for extra - solar giant planets would be to group planets which are close to their stars , regardless of mass loss history . in this `` observer s scheme , ''",
    "the planet s evolution is ignored , but the definitions are more sensible for today s detection technologies . however , in terms of origins of planetary systems , classifying planets according to their evolutions , as we have done , is more sensible .    in our model ,",
    "planets are considered to have disappeared completely once their masses become less than 0.4 @xmath111 . in reality , of course , mass loss continues below this cutoff , and a stage could be reached in which all of the gaseous envelope of a giant planet was stripped away , leaving a rocky core .",
    "jupiter s core is thought to be @xmath135 , or @xmath130  30  earth masses ( 1  earth mass  =  1  @xmath136  =  @xmath137  g ) , and made of dense , rocky material ( hubbard 1984 ) .",
    "if such a remnant body were uncovered by atmospheric mass loss onto the central star , the remaining core , whose density is much higher than jupiter s density overall , would not be in a mass overflow regime , and could continue to migrate or survive at this mass .",
    "in other words , a temporary halting of mass loss would exist when the core is uncovered , and therefore there might be a plateau in final masses at around the mass of jupiter s core .",
    "thus , the final mass and semi - major axis distribution of extrasolar planets may include a family of planets with masses approximately equal to jupiter s core , at small distances ; these bodies would be rocky , as opposed to primarily gaseous .",
    "detection of 30 @xmath136 bodies at small distances might therefore provide evidence for roche lobe overflow from primarily gaseous giant planets , representing remnant cores of the larger bodies .",
    "these smaller mass planets would not necessarily have been detected , given current radial velocity sensitivies , depending on heliocentric distance ( marcy et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "how important are the three torques which we consider ? in figure  [ nono ] , similar to figure  [ at ] , we show the results of calculating a planet s migration in the nominal disk with two of the three torques which we include in our model",
    ". we can consider a system in which mass loss is not present , e.g. , the planets are point - mass planets , simulating rocky planets , as compared to the nominal gaseous jupiter used in our standard model .",
    "for systems in which mass loss is not present but stellar tidal torques are , planets can approach the star much more than in the nominal case .",
    "ultimately , stellar tidal torques are not enough to reverse a planet s motion , so that unless the disk dissipates , these planets will dissappear onto their central stars .",
    "rocky planets ( i.e. , planets without mass loss ) are an interesting special case , but probably do not represent a physically plausible creation mechanism for giant planets . in a system in which stellar tidal torques do not exist , a planet loses mass on a timescale equivalent to its migration timescale . and thus very few planets are rescued by the disk s evaporation .",
    "planets in systems without tidal torques would only rarely survive once reaching small heliocentric distances .",
    "however , as is demonstrated in figure  [ nono ] , the combination of all three torques extends a planet s lifetime in proximity to its central star such that a reasonable fraction of planets can survive at small heliocentric distances . with only two of the three torques acting ,",
    "the already narrow critical mass range becomes vanishingly small .",
    "the effects of several key parameters on the fates of planets can be seen in figure  [ trends ] , which plots the boundary ( in initial masses ) between class ii and class iii planets , versus varied model parameter .",
    "this boundary is effectively a proxy for the initial mass for which planets will survive at small heliocentric distances , at @xmath138 .",
    "larger viscosities and larger diskmasses cause the critical mass range to shift to higher masses by creating larger disk torques on the migrating planets , so that planets migrate faster .",
    "the result is that planets at small heliocentric distances could have larger masses than is the case for our nominal model .",
    "conversely , larger initial heliocentric distances allow for planets with smaller masses to reach small orbital separations , since the time to migrate to small heliocentric distances is longer , and fewer planets have enough time to migrate in close and lose all their mass before the disk dissipates .",
    "larger values of @xmath139 also move the critical mass range to larger initial masses , because the tidal torque is lessened , so planets feel less strong outward torque due to tides .",
    "the dependence on @xmath139 is fairly weak , however .",
    "lastly , the relevant timescales cause their obvious changes in the critical mass central value : smaller disk lifetimes move the critical mass range to smaller masses , and larger disk lifetimes cause the critical mass range to move to larger initial masses .",
    "shorter effective disk lifetimes can allow planets which fall into class i in the nominal disk to fall into either class ii or iii in a disk with a shorter lifetime , depending on how the migration time compares to the shorter disk lifetime .",
    "the effect of requiring larger initial masses to survive is twofold .",
    "firstly , it means that fewer objects will survive if larger initial masses are needed to survive .",
    "this is simply because the fraction of planets with initial masses below this cutoff is larger , so that fewer of the total number of planets survive until @xmath113years . in other words , the mass range which bounds class",
    "i is larger , so more planets fall into class i and do not survive . secondly",
    ", a wider range of final masses at small heliocentric distances is possible . since there is a piling up of planets at small heliocentric distance at about the initial mass for which @xmath140 ( i.e. , the boundary between classes ii and iii ) , the effect of moving this boundary to larger initial masses is to create a piling up at larger final masses .",
    "furthermore , planets at small heliocentric distances can have final masses less than their initial masses ; so that if the mass for which @xmath140 is larger than nominal , then the range of masses between @xmath140 and @xmath141 is larger , and planets at small heliocentric distances can have a wider range of final masses .",
    "for example , in the nominal disk , it is not possible to have a 5  @xmath111 planet reside at small heliocentric distances .",
    "however , at larger @xmath4 s , a 5 @xmath111 planet can end up at @xmath142 1au .",
    "therefore , a wider range of fates is possible when the cutoff mass is larger ; however , fewer total planets survive when the cutoff mass is larger .",
    "future elaborations in our model include examining non - conservative forces which may control the width of the critical mass range ( for example , stellar wind and magnetic field interactions ) . in our model",
    ", we have taken the effect of atmospheric evaporation of the planet to be small .",
    "guillot et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find that , for 51  peg  b , in its close orbit , thermal evaporation ( classical jeans escape ) is insignificant , and that nonthermal evaporation could cause a total mass loss , over the lifetime of the system , of less than 1% of the mass of the planet . in our model , planets can migrate to locations inside of 51 peg b s heliocentric distance , thus having higher temperatures and increased stellar fluxes . therefore , while the net effect is probably small relative to mass loss and tidal torques , further refinement of the model necessitates re - examination of stellar wind effects .    our solar system ,",
    "of course , should not have been immune to giant planet migration . if jupiter has moved somewhat from its initial location , there are possible ramifications for other bodies in our solar system .",
    "liou & malhotra ( 1997 ) have explored the dynamical effects on asteroids of a migrating jupiter , and show that a depleted region in the outer asteroid belt can be explained by jupiter migrating inward 0.2au .",
    "one model run produces a 1@xmath80 planet which forms at 5.2au in a disk of less than nominal mass and @xmath3 of @xmath1years , and halts its inward migration at 4.48au .",
    "this disk has a shorter than nominal lifetime ( that is , time after the planet has fully formed ) , and a less than nominal diskmass .",
    "these parameters may represent a disk which is already dissipating as the planet starts to migrate , implying a formation time for jupiter of nearly @xmath30years , if our circumstellar disk lasted the nominal @xmath30years after protostar collapse . by estimating jupiter s migration distance",
    ", we may be able to start describing the circumstellar disk conditions in our early solar system .",
    "it has been proposed that orbital resonances with jupiter may play an important role in the formation of asteroids and terrestrial planets ( wetherill 1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "jupiters which migrate through several aus must certainly disrupt the formation of smaller planetary bodies as orbital resonances sweep through the circumstellar disk , and it is almost certain that any earth - like planets which were forming at 1au in the 51 peg system during the time that 51 peg b migrated inward were disrupted .",
    "the gap in the disk fills in on the viscous time scale after the passage of the planet ; if the disk fills in completely enough and rapidly enough after giant planet passage , it is possible that terrestrial - sized planets could form in the wake of planetary migration , although the orbital resonances from a very close companion would be very different and probably much less important than from a jupiter - mass planet at 5.2au .",
    "planets in circumstellar disks are subject to various torques which can cause the planets to migrate inward .",
    "we present results from a self - consistent quantitative model which describes evolution and migration of giant planets .",
    "some planets migrate very rapidly and disappear due to mass loss in less time than the disk lifetime .",
    "other planets or planets under other disk conditions can be left in various orbits , from very close to the star to very close to where they started , and with masses equal to or less than their initial masses .",
    "there is a wide range of possible fates ( heliocentric distance and final mass ) for migrating jupiters .",
    "a migrating planet has one of three possible fates : losing mass to the point of extinction ( class i ) ; surviving but having lost some of its mass onto the central star ( class ii ) ; or surviving after having migrated and not lost any mass ( class iii ) .",
    "some planets in this last class may have migrated only a small radial distance .",
    "the width of class ii is a function of a variety of disk and star parameters .",
    "the region of @xmath132 space delimited by @xmath143 2@xmath111 and @xmath144 0.05au is populated _ only _ by class ii planets , and includes 51 peg b and @xmath126 and b. all observed extrasolar close companions fall within the population of surviving planets in our model ( classes ii and iii ) , suggesting that this mechanism may explain the detections of planets very close to their stars .",
    "we also suggest a `` piling up '' effect at small heliocentric distances , and that planets may survive close to their stars in numbers disproportionate to initial distributions",
    ".    an observational way of assessing the significance of mass loss for the orbital evolution of giant planets would be to look at the orbital distances of planets around different types of stars . if there is no systematic effect ( for example , due to different chemical compositions ) , the internal evolution of the planets should be the same around any star .",
    "but around more massive stars ( e.g. f type stars ) , mass loss would occur at larger distances , whereas less massive ones ( e.g. k type stars ) should be able to retain some planets at smaller heliocentric distances .",
    "furthermore , since all planets in our study with small ( @xmath145 ) mass and small ( 0.05au ) orbital distances have lost mass , another possible test of our mechanism in the future is to study the compositions of the planetary remnants which survive and their stars to detect chemical signatures of mass transfer .",
    "if signatures exist , observationally defining the boundary between class ii and class iii planets would be possible , thereby testing the model and , in turn , constraining the initial conditions of the circumstellar disk in which the planet formed .",

    "<S> giant planets in circumstellar disks can migrate inward from their initial ( formation ) positions . </S>",
    "<S> radial migration is caused by inward torques between the planet and the disk ; by outward torques between the planet and the spinning star ; and by outward torques due to roche lobe overflow and consequent mass loss from the planet . </S>",
    "<S> we present self - consistent numerical considerations of the problem of migrating giant planets . summing torques on planets for various physical parameters , we find that jupiter - mass planets can stably arrive and survive at small heliocentric distances , thus reproducing observed properties of some of the recently discovered extra - solar planets . </S>",
    "<S> inward migration timescales can be approximately equal to or less than disk lifetimes and star spindown timescales . therefore , the range of fates of massive planets is broad , and generally comprises three classes : ( i ) planets which migrate inward too rapidly and lose all their mass ; ( ii ) planets which migrate inward , lose some but not all of their mass , and survive in very small orbits ; and ( iii ) planets which do not lose any mass . </S>",
    "<S> some planets in class iii do not migrate very far from their formation locations . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that there is a wide range of possible fates for jupiter - mass planets for both final heliocentric distance and final mass . </S>"
