    "ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds ) are compact stellar systems with characteristics between those of globular clusters and compact elliptical galaxies , particularly with sizes between 10 and 100 pc .",
    "ucds were discovered in the fornax cluster ( hilker et al .",
    "1999 ; drinkwater et al .",
    "subsequent searches in other galaxy clusters revealed that , far from being an oddity to fornax , ucds were present in all major galaxy clusters in the nearby universe ( brns & kroupa 2012 and their comprehensive set of references therein ) .    in recent years several studies",
    "have searched for ucds in environments other than galaxy clusters .",
    "new ucds have been found in low density environments ( hau et al .",
    "2009 ) , galaxy groups ( romanowsky et al .  2009 ) , and field galaxies ( norris & kannappan 2011 ) . within this framework , and through the analysis of advanced camera for surveys imaging , madrid ( 2011 ) found 11 ucds and 39 extended star cluster candidates associated with the fossil group ngc 1132 .",
    "these objects were identified through the analysis of their colors , luminosity , and structural parameters .",
    "fossil groups are galaxy systems where a luminous early type galaxy is brighter than any other group member by more than two magnitudes .",
    "this dominant galaxy is believed to be the end product of the merger of a galaxy group into a single entity ( ponman et al .",
    "fossil groups have x - ray luminosities comparable to galaxy groups but a characteristic absence of @xmath5 galaxies ( jones et al .",
    "analysis of numerical simulations show that fossil groups had an early assembly and a passive evolution thereafter ( e.g.   daz - gimnez et al .",
    "the surface brightness profile and the globular cluster system of the fossil group ngc 1132 were studied by alamo - martnez et al .",
    "these authors find that both surface brightness and specific frequency of globular clusters ( @xmath6 ) in ngc 1132 are similar to those of normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "nine out of eleven ucd candidates found by madrid ( 2011 ) share the same parameter space as the brightest globular clusters in the color magnitude diagram of the ngc 1132 globular cluster system .",
    "one ucd candidate , that will be designated as ucd1 , is almost four magnitudes brighter than the brightest globular cluster associated with ngc 1132 .",
    "ucd1 is 6.6 kpc from the center of ngc 1132 , has a half - light radius of 77.1 pc and a magnitude of @xmath7 mag .",
    "a second ucd candidate , for which a spectrum was also obtained , had particularly blue colors compared to the most luminous globular clusters .",
    "the characteristics of ucd1 make it an interesting object since it is the link between the most massive ucds found so far and the lowest mass m32-like galaxies .",
    "ucd1 is the brightest object in a recent compilation of 813 ucds and extended objects ( brns & kroupa 2012 ) . indeed , high surface brightness compact elliptical galaxies , or `` m32-like '' stellar systems are rare .",
    "chilingarian & mamon ( 2008 ) list only six confirmed stellar systems similar to m32 .",
    "as pointed out recently by brns & kroupa ( 2012 ) only one fifth of all published ultra - compact dwarfs have been so far spectroscopically confirmed . in this work",
    ", we present the results of an observing campaign with gemini north to obtain spectroscopic follow - up of ucd candidates in the fossil group ngc 1132 presented by madrid ( 2011 ) .",
    "spectra for seven ucd candidates , and the brightest globular cluster in the fossil group ngc 1132 were obtained with the gemini north telescope using the gemini multi object spectrograph ( gmos ) .",
    "these observations were acquired under program gn-2012b - q-10 .",
    "ucd candidates were determined through the analysis of hst imaging .",
    "a multislit mask was created using a pre - image provided by gemini .",
    "given that the advanced camera for surveys on board hst has a field of view of @xmath8 arcseconds all targets are located within this small area centered on the host galaxy .",
    "the central concentration limited the total number of targets that fit on the gmos slit mask .",
    "the spectroscopic data were acquired in queue mode on 20 september 2012 using a multislit mask .",
    "individual slits had a width of one arcsecond .",
    "the grating in use was the b600@xmath9g5323 that has a ruling density of 600 lines / mm .",
    "three exposures of 1800 s each were obtained with the central wavelengths of 497 , and 502 nm .",
    "two additional exposures of 1800 s each were obtained with a central wavelength of 507 nm .",
    "science targets have thus a total exposure time of @xmath04 hours",
    ". flatfields , spectra of the standard star @xmath10 , and the copper - argon @xmath11 lamp were also acquired to perform flux calibration .",
    "a binning of @xmath12 was used , yielding a scale of 0.1456 arcseconds per pixel and a theoretical dispersion of @xmath13    per pixel .",
    "our targets transit @xmath14 from the zenith and if the position angle is set to @xmath15 the displacement due to atmospheric refraction is small in our configuration .",
    "slit losses due to atmospheric refraction can be neglected .",
    "all science and calibration files were retrieved from the gemini science archive hosted by the canadian astronomy data center .",
    "the data reduction described below was carried out with the gemini iraf package .",
    "flatfields were derived with the task gsflat and the flatfield exposures .",
    "spectra were reduced using gsreduce , this does a standard data reduction , that is , performs bias , overscan , and cosmic ray removal as well as applying the flatfield derived with gsflat .",
    "gmos - north detectors are read with six amplifiers and generates files with six extensions .",
    "the task gmosaic was used to generate data files with a single extension .",
    "the sky level was removed interactively using the task gskysub and the spectra were extracted using gsextract .",
    "flux calibration was performed using the spectra of the standard star @xmath16 , acquired with an identical instrument configuration .",
    "spectra of @xmath11 lamps were obtained immediately after the science targets were observed and were used to achieve wavelength calibration using the task gswavelength .",
    "we use gstransform to rectify , interpolate , and calibrate the spectra using the wavelength solution found by gswavelength .",
    "the sensitivity function of the instrument was derived using gsstandard and the reference file for @xmath16 provided by gemini observatory .",
    "science spectra were flux calibrated with gscalibrate which uses the sensitivity function derived by gsstandard .",
    "figure 1 presents the calibrated spectra of six ucds , the brightest globular cluster of the ngc 1132 globular cluster system , and a background galaxy thought to be a ucd with particularly blue colors .",
    "various absorption lines are identifiable in the spectra of ucds , particularly in the spectrum of ucd1 which has a higher signal to noise ratio .",
    "the two most prominent absorption features in the spectrum of ucd1 are the magnesium and sodium doublets with restframe wavelengths of 5169 , 5175    and 5890 , 5896    respectively .",
    "these two doublets are also evident in the ucd spectra published by francis et al .",
    "other lines present in the spectrum of ucd1 are ca and fe ( 5269  ) , fe ( 5331  ; 4384 ) , heii ( 5411  ) , h@xmath17 ( 4861  ) , and cai ( 4227  ) .",
    "the redshift of the targets is derived using the iraf task fxcor that computes radial velocities by deriving the fourier cross correlation between two spectra . as a reference spectrum",
    "we use data of the galactic globular cluster bh 176 taken in the same gmos configuration during a previous gemini run ( davoust et al .",
    "for ucd1 the task fxcor returns a radial velocity of 7158 @xmath1832 km / s .",
    "the host galaxy ngc 1132 has a published radial velocity of 6935@xmath1811 km / s ( collobert et al .",
    "2006 ) . with these results",
    "we confirm that ucd1 is located within the fossil group ngc 1132 at a redshift of @xmath190.023 .",
    "this redshift measurement validates the photometric and structural parameters derived by madrid ( 2011 ) for ucd1 .",
    "a caveat for this section is relevant : an accurate age and metallicity determination of the old stellar systems studied here is difficult . in a similar spectroscopic study of ucds , francis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) derived the ages of 21 ultra - compact dwarfs using both lick indices and spectral fitting of simple stellar populations and the results of these two techniques do not correlate with one another .",
    "the metallicities of these 21 ucds , also derived by francis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , have better uncertainties and show a correlation between the two methods with an offset of 0.2 dex .    the stellar populations synthesis code starlight ( cid fernandes et al .",
    "2005 ) was used with the aim of deriving the metallicity of ucd1 .",
    "starlight compared the gemini spectrum of ucd1 with a database of 150 spectral templates and found that the best fit is provided by a combination of two stellar populations : one representing 30% of the flux and having solar metallicity ( @xmath20=0.02 ) and a second population accounting for 70% of the flux and having supersolar metallicity ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this spectral fitting also yields an age of 13 gyr for ucd1 .    for spectra with sufficient signal - to - noise lick indices ( worthey et al .",
    "1994 ) can be derived .",
    "the code gonzo ( puzia et al .  2002 ) was used to derive lick indices for ucd1 which is the only ucd with enough signal to generate significant results .",
    "the gemini spectrum is degraded to the lick resolution by gonzo .",
    "we also apply the zero points of the calibration given by loubser et al .",
    "the values for the lick indices and their associated poisson errors are given in table 1 , this allows comparison with existent and future studies . by comparing the indices @xmath22 and mgb to the single stellar population models of thomas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we can derive an @xmath23-element abundance for ucd1 of @xmath24$]=+0.3 .",
    "indices h@xmath17=1.96    and fe 5270 = 3.57    of ucd1 are very similar to the values derived by chiboucas et al .",

    "ucd 121666 has an h@xmath17=1.84    and fe 5270 = 3.48  .",
    "the lick indices we obtained were given as input to the publicly available code ez ages ( graves & schiavon 2008 ) .",
    "this code determines ages and abundances of unresolved stellar populations using their lick indices .",
    "we chose an alpha - enhanced isochrone fitting and found an age of 7.5 gyr and an iron abundance of @xmath25$]= -0.17 .",
    "the chemical abundances of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) yield a metallicity of @xmath26 .",
