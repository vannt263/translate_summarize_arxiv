    "gene regulatory networks describe the effective interactions between genes .",
    "the activity of a gene , i.e. , its current rate of being transcribed into rna molecules , can have effects on the activity levels of other genes , which will as a result become up- or down- regulated .",
    "the sum of all up- and down- regulation relations in the whole genome is the gene regulatory network .",
    "the complete knowledge of the gene network would reveal a large portion of an understanding of life . however , this goal is far from being achieved . with present dna - chip technology",
    "it is possible to measure the transcription rates at a given point in time of an entire genome , but even these technologies only allow a glimpse on the structure of the underlying network , due to the underdeterminedness of the problem @xcite .",
    "this situation got the physics community interested , to statistically characterize the available data and to ( crudely ) estimate the structure of the complex networks governing gene dynamics .",
    "a step toward an identification of potential gene interaction networks is to identify and quantify meaningful _ statistical _ indicators of gene cooperative behavior , which is the main purpose of the present work .",
    "the idea is that fluctuations of gene expressions over time , e.g. , during a cell - cycle , can be considered as an output of an interacting gene collective forming a structured network .",
    "the hope is that a network structure estimate can be inferred from statistical properties .",
    "at least it should be possible to statistically characterize the types of potential candidate networks .",
    "we consider the time - course expression data @xmath1 for the genome of yeast _ s. cerevisiae _ @xcite .",
    "we determine some statistical indicators of collective dynamical behavior of genes , such as the @xmath0-exponential fit of the cumulative distribution , a ranking distribution and a mean - variance analysis of differential gene expressions .",
    "we construct and estimate the expression - correlation network from time increments of expression data and analyse clusters and spanning trees .",
    "we identify biological function of genes with use of yeast database @xcite .",
    "we find that the resulting , correlation based clusters match considerably well with specific biological functions of genes in the cell .",
    "the genome - wide gene expression data in @xcite are given in the form of a matrix @xmath1 in which every row represents one of @xmath2 yeast genes and each column contains the time evolution of gene expression of that gene @xmath3 .",
    "gene expressions are measured at 17 time points , taken every 10 minutes which covers approximately two full cell - cycles .",
    "we first properly normalize the gene expressions for each of the 17 measurements separately by dividing each gene expression value by the average value of gene expression for that corresponding column . in order to avoid systematic trends in the time series we use _ differential _ expression data defined as @xmath4 for each gene @xmath3 .",
    "we determine the cumulative distribution @xmath5 for each time - interval separately and also all measurements ( all entries in matrix ) .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "1 a. this distribution can be fitted to a @xmath0-exponential form @xcite , @xmath6^\\frac{1}{1-q } \\ ; \\ \\   q \\neq 1 \\quad , \\label{pdf}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 represents the non - extensivity parameter .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath0 for the various time - intervals are in the range @xmath7 .",
    "the average over all times yields @xmath8 , potentially indicating a non - trivial collective behavior of genes along the cell - cycle .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for @xmath9 the functional clusters and branches remain for a while before they gradually disappear in the noise .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed character of the correlation distributions in fig .  2 , where smaller deviations from a gaussian distribution are found for @xmath10 .",
    "in conclusion , we made several observations about the statistical nature of gene expression data which seem to suggest that at least a significant fraction of genes is up / down regulated in a highly collective manner .",
    "indicators pointing in this direction are : ( _ i _ ) the cumulative distribution of differential gene expressions can be fitted to @xmath0-exponentials , with a non - trivial @xmath11 ; ( _ ii _ ) an approximate zipf s law holds in the ordering distribution of differential expressions ; ( _ iii _ ) an almost linear mean variance dependence with @xmath12 signals tightly driven dynamics ; ( _ iv _ ) the correlation matrix element distributions are non - gaussian and non - poisson and finally , ( _ v _ ) even crude correlation coefficient network displays the emergence of clusters and functional branches in minimum spanning trees , which seem to be biologically relevant .",
