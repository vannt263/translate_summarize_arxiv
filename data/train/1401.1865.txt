    "now we may assume that @xmath1 has no 5-cycles .",
    "since every vertex belongs to a cycle of length at most 5 , we see that every vertex lies in a triangle , which gives two adjacent triangles .",
    "this case was treated before , and thus the proof is complete .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : cubic ] can be used to derive an even stronger conclusion , asserting that a positive fraction of the `` median '' eigenvalues lie between @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "[ thm : linearly many ] there is a constant @xmath282 such that for every subcubic graph @xmath1 of order @xmath2 , all its eigenvalues @xmath75 , where @xmath283 , belong to the interval @xmath284 $ ] .",
    "we shall prove the theorem with @xmath285 , with no intention to improve the constant .",
    "let @xmath1 be a subcubic graph and @xmath286 .",
    "then one of the following holds :    * there is a vertex @xmath130 at distance at most 3 from @xmath120 such that @xmath287 .",
    "* @xmath120 does not belong to a cycle of length @xmath288 or less .",
    "* @xmath120 lies on an induced cycle of length 4 or 5 whose vertices have distinct neighbors out of the cycle . *",
    "@xmath120 or one of its neighbors lies on a 3-cycle which either shares an edge with another 3-cycle or one of its vertices is adjacent to another 3-cycle . * @xmath120 lies on a 4-cycle or a 5-cycle with an adjacent triangle .",
    "in each of these cases , when previous cases were excluded for the vertex @xmath120 , we found a set @xmath289 of vertices , all at distance at most 4 from @xmath120 , and a subset @xmath290 , and have defined a multigraph @xmath133 by deleting vertices in @xmath155 and adding some edges between the vertices in @xmath291 .",
    "after that we proved that , starting with an unfriendly partition of @xmath133 , we can extend it to a nice partition @xmath104 of @xmath1 such that one of the following holds :    * @xmath104 has an unstable vertex in @xmath289 , or * @xmath104 can be changed by exchanging parts for some vertices in @xmath289 such that some vertex in @xmath289 becomes unstable , or * @xmath104 can be changed to a partition @xmath292 , where either @xmath293 , @xmath294 , @xmath295 ( where @xmath296 ) , and all components of @xmath297 have at most two edges except for the component @xmath190 containing vertices in @xmath155 , and @xmath190 satisfies @xmath298 and @xmath299 ; or the same properties hold with the roles of @xmath300 and @xmath301 interchanged .",
    "now , let us start with a maximal collection of vertices @xmath302 such that any two of them are at distance at least 11 from each other .",
    "since every vertex @xmath120 in a subcubic graph has at most @xmath303 vertices at distance 10 or less , we have that @xmath304 .    for each vertex @xmath153 ( @xmath305 )",

    "we define @xmath309 in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "now we form the multigraph @xmath133 by removing all subsets @xmath310 ( @xmath305 ) and adding edges to each @xmath311 as required in each case .",
    "the distance condition implies that these changes do not interfere with each other , neither when defining @xmath133 , nor when producing the nice partition @xmath104 or @xmath292 satisfying ( i)(iii ) simultaneously for each case .    each change in",
    "( i)(iii ) increases either @xmath113 or @xmath312 by @xmath313 , where @xmath314 .",
    "let @xmath263 be the number of cases where @xmath113 increases , and let @xmath315 be the number of cases where @xmath312 increases . then either @xmath316 or @xmath317 .",
    "whichever case holds , we can get a partition of @xmath106 to which the eigenvalue interlacing theorem can be applied to show that @xmath318 eigenvalues preceding @xmath319 and @xmath318 eigenvalues succeeding @xmath320 all belong to the interval @xmath284 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath281 in theorem [ thm : linearly many ] can not be replaced by any smaller number as shown by the union of many copies of the fano plane incidence graph .    as for",
    "a `` rough converse '' of theorem [ thm : linearly many ] , let us observe that every subcubic graph @xmath1 of order @xmath2 , none of whose components is a path of length at most 3 , has at least @xmath321 eigenvalues that are larger or equal to @xmath322 .",
    "to see this , observe that @xmath1 has an induced subgraph consisting of @xmath323 copies of @xmath324 , @xmath325 , and @xmath326 . since the spectral radius of each of these components is at least @xmath322 , eigenvalue interlacing implies the above stated fact .",
    "the following theorem shows that the constant @xmath322 can be improved to @xmath327 if @xmath1 has minimum degree at least 2 , and to @xmath328 if @xmath1 is cubic .",

    ", we see that their @xmath337-balls are disjoint and non - adjacent , and the interlacing theorem shows that @xmath1 has at least @xmath341 eigenvalues that are larger than @xmath335 .",
    "cycles show that @xmath327 can not be improved in the subcubic case ( with minimum degree 2 ) , and ramanujan graphs @xcite show that @xmath328 can not be increased for cubic graphs .    a version of theorem [ thm : linearly many large ] for negative eigenvalues does not hold since there are @xmath15-regular graphs of arbitrarily large degree and diameter whose smallest eigenvalue is @xmath342 ( for example , all line graphs have this property ) .",
