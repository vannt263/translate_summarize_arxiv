    "spread - spectrum code - division multiple - access ( cdma ) is used extensively in modern wireless communication systems and serves preeminently in commercial cellular networks .",
    "investigation of reliable ( _ i.e. _ errorless ) communication via the cdma channel is a long - standing and productive research topic ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a typical investigation of a cdma channel often assumes an upper bounded transmission power , but no restrictions on complexity are imposed . in the era of ubiquitous and pervasive communications , in , for example , indoor and personal area networks ( pan ) , there is an emerging interest in a complementary scenario . according to this scenario , the cdma system operates in a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime ( thus power limitation is less crucial ) , but",
    "is highly restricted by its receiver s signal processing complexity .",
    "for instance , this is the case in complexity - limited ( rather than noise - limited ) cdma downlink , where the simplest mobile receiver is to be used .",
    "such a trivial receiver requires that detected bits , sliced at the output of the channel s matched filter , must be the same as the transmitted binary inputs .",
    "formerly , there has been no examination of the information - theoretic characteristics of cdma channels in this setting , being especially applicable for the downlink .    in this contribution",
    ", we compute the shannon capacity of such a complexity - constrained cdma channel with binary signaling , random spreading and arbitrary user load . for this purpose , we borrow analysis tools from equilibrium statistical mechanics , especially the hopfield model of neural networks  @xcite . the achievable asymptotic information rates of such naive cdma channels , which may seem worthless from an information - theoretic point of view , are found to result in valuable rates , comparable to those achieved by using the optimal multi - user receiver .",
    "consider a noiseless synchronous cdma downlink accessing @xmath0 active users via the mutual channel in order to transmit their designated ( coded ) information binary symbols , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 .",
    "each transmission to a user is assigned with a binary signature sequence ( spreading code ) of @xmath3 chips , @xmath4 . assuming a random spreading model , the binary chips are independently equiprobably chosen , and the deterministic chip waveform has unit energy .",
    "the cross - correlation between users transmissions is @xmath5 .",
    "the received signal is passed through the user s matched filter .",
    "thus , the overall channel input - output relation is described by [ eq_channel ] y_k = x_k+_ik_kix_i , where the @xmath6th user matched filter output , @xmath7 , is the designated bit , @xmath8 , corrupted by an interference term .",
    "this interference term is composed of a summation over ( cross - correlation ) scaled versions of all other users bits .",
    "the set of all cross - correlations @xmath9 is hereinafter denoted by @xmath10 . in the following asymptotic analysis , we assume that @xmath11 , yet the system load factor @xmath12 is kept constant , and that the information rate is the same for all users , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath13 .",
    "we want to convey information reliably through the channel  ( [ eq_channel ] ) under a low - complexity constraint on the user receiver . according to this constraint , detected bits , @xmath14 , obtained by performing hard decisions directly on the channel s matched filter output samples ,",
    "must be the same as the transmitted bits .",
    "explicitly , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the trivial sign function . under the constraints outlined above it is clear that not all combinations of input symbols will result in errorless communication .",
    "thus , the capacity of the channel can be obtained by evaluating the number of codewords that ensure errorless detection .",
    "following , we prove that this complexity - constrained cdma channel setting yields non - trivial capacity .",
    "a binary codeword @xmath17 , composed of all @xmath0 users bits at a given channel use , for which the channel constraints hold , satisfies the condition [ eq_stable ] _ 0^_k=1^kd_k(y_k-_kx_k^c)= _ 0^_k=1^kd_k(y_k-_kx_k^c)=1 , where @xmath18 is the dirac delta function .",
    "let the random variable @xmath19 denote the number of codewords , _",
    "i.e. _ [ eq_number0 ] ( k,,)_-^_kd_k _ * x*_k(_ik_kix_i-_kx_k ) , where @xmath20 corresponds to a sum over all the possible values of the transmitted input symbols . assuming equal user information rates , the corresponding asymptotic capacity of the channel is defined  @xcite , in bit information units , as @xmath21 .",
    "according to the self - averaging property  @xcite , in the large - system limit , @xmath11 , the number of successful codewords @xmath19 is equal to its expectation with respect to ( w.r.t . ) the distribution of @xmath10 , _",
    "i.e. _ [ eq_number1 ] _ k(k,,)&=&()= _ k_-^_kd_k + & & _ * x*_,where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the average and averaging operation , respectively . representing the delta function by the inverse fourier transform of an exponent and substituting @xmath24 for the angular frequency of the fourier transform @xmath25 , expression  ( [ eq_number1 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as [ eq_number3 ] ( ) & = & _ k_-^_kd_k _ -^_kd_k + & & _ * x * , where @xmath26 and [ eq_expectation ] _",
    ".the expectation @xmath27 can be also written as [ eq_expectation11 ] & = & + & & _ . using a transformation  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 2.14 ) ) , the expectation becomes [ eq_expectation2 ] & = & _ -^ _ + & & _ -^ _ + & & , where @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath29 in  ( [ eq_expectation11 ] ) is @xmath30 for an overwhelming majority of codewords , for the expectation @xmath27 to be finite , @xmath31 and @xmath32 must be @xmath33 .",
    "hence , expanding the @xmath34 term in exponent  ( [ eq_expectation2 ] ) and neglecting terms of order @xmath35 and higher , we get [ eq_expectation3 ] & = & _ -^ _ + & & _ -^ _ + & & , where @xmath36 .",
    "now , the multi - dimensional integral  ( [ eq_expectation3 ] ) is solved using the following mathematical recipe : new variables are introduced a_(a_+b_)^2 , b_(a_^2-b_^2)+1[eq_a ] .",
    "equations  ( [ eq_a ] ) can be reformulated via the integral representation of a delta function using the corresponding angular frequencies @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , _ -^=1 , + _ -^=1[eq_bf].substituting these ( unity ) integrals into the expectation expression  ( [ eq_expectation3 ] ) and rewriting it using @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the integrations over @xmath31 and @xmath32 are decoupled and can be performed easily .",
    "next , for the asymptotics @xmath11 , the integration over the frequencies @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be performed algebraically by the saddle - point method  @xcite . according to this method",
    ", the main contribution to the integral comes from values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the vicinity of the maximum of the exponent s argument .",
    "finally , the @xmath27 term boils down to [ eq_expectation_final ] & = & _ -^ + & & . substituting the expectation term  ( [ eq_expectation_final ] ) back in  ( [ eq_number3 ] ) ,",
    "the integrand in the latter becomes independent of @xmath41 , therefore the @xmath20 can be substituted by multiplying with the scalar @xmath42 , and the resulting @xmath43 dependent integrand is a gaussian function . thus performing gaussian integration and exploiting the symmetry in the @xmath0-dimensional space , we get [ eq_number4 ] & & ( ) = _",
    "k _ -^ + & & + & & .using the rescaling @xmath44 , the integral  ( [ eq_number4 ] ) becomes [ eq_integral ] ( ) = _ k_-^ , where the function @xmath45 is defined by g(a , b,)&&(b-++ ) + & + & ( 2q(t)).the definitions of the auxiliary variable @xmath46 and the error function @xmath47 are used . again , for @xmath11 , the double integral in  ( [ eq_integral ] ) can be evaluated by the saddle - point method .",
    "hence , we find [ eq_finalnumber ] ( ) _ k , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are found by the saddle - point conditions , which yield the following equations & = & ^-1(-1)+t=0 , + & = & ^-1(1-)+=0.the operator @xmath50 denotes a derivative of @xmath51 w.r.t .",
    "its argument .",
    "one then finds that this set of equations is satisfied by @xmath52 and a^=^-1/(^-1+),[eq_fix_a ] where @xmath53 .",
    "this saddle - point condition s fixed - point @xmath48 can be found iteratively , and it always converges in the examined model  @xcite",
    ".    finally , substituting  ( [ eq_finalnumber ] ) the asymptotic capacity , in nat per symbol per user , is now easily obtained [ eq_c ] c_()&=&g(a^,b^,)=(2q(t^ ) ) + & + & ( b^-++ ) , which forms our pivotal result . in section  [ sec_results ]",
    "we further discuss the theoretical results and compare them with computer simulations of the complexity - constrained cdma channel .",
    "fig .  [ fig_capacity ] displays the asymptotic capacity @xmath54  ( [ eq_c ] ) , obtained by solving iteratively the saddle - point condition  ( [ eq_fix_a ] ) , as a function of the load @xmath55 .",
    "interestingly , for small @xmath56 values the trivial 1 bit upper bound ( of an optimal receiver , _",
    "i.e. _ matrix inversion ) is practically achieved by this simple hard decision operation .",
    "nevertheless , even for higher non - trivial system load such a complexity - constrained cdma setting still yields substantial achievable information rates .",
    "note , in passing , that for heavily overloaded system ( _ i.e. _ @xmath57 ) the capacity curve decay coincides with hopfield model s capacity ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 12 ) ) for an analytical approximation of this capacity decay to zero . )",
    "( solid line ) , in terms of bit / symbol / user , as a function of load @xmath55 . also drawn is the finite - size simulation - averaged capacity @xmath58 for @xmath59 ( empty squares ) .",
    "vertical bars stand for standard deviation in simulation results.,width=288 ]    in order to validate the analytically derived asymptotic capacity @xmath60 , we evaluated the capacity @xmath61 of a cdma downlink channel with large , yet finite number of users @xmath0 , using exhaustive search simulations .",
    "the number of successful binary codewords , maintaining the channel constraints , was obtained by examining all @xmath42 possible codewords .",
    "the average logarithm of the counted number , normalized by the number of users @xmath0 , gives the capacity @xmath58 .",
    "[ fig_capacity ] presents the capacity obtained by simulations for @xmath59 .",
    "as can be seen , the empirical capacity for finite @xmath0 deviates only slightly from the analytically obtained asymptotic capacity .",
    "these results substantiate the analysis of the complexity - constrained cdma channel .",
    "we evaluated the asymptotic capacity of a cdma downlink channel model requiring only minimal signal processing at the receiver , thus suitable for interference - limited systems with low - complexity constrained mobile equipment .",
    "interestingly , we found a range of non - trivial achievable rates . according to these findings , at a given channel use a fraction of the users , equal to @xmath54 ( in bit ) ,",
    "can receive its designated information with rate @xmath62 , while the transmissions to the rest of the users ensure reliable communication .",
    "determining these redundant transmissions in a diagrammatic manner ( rather than via brute - force enumeration , which becomes infeasible for large @xmath0 ) remains an interesting open research question .",
