    "the stars themselves are mysterious enough to study .",
    "w uma - type contact binaries ( cbs ) are , in many respects , excellent objects to research , being among the most observed stars and having experienced mass transfer between components .",
    "the observational data of individual systems and statistical properties of entire data show so many regular and irregular variations that many contradictory ideas concerning their structure and evolution have been perpetuated .",
    "recently , yildiz & doan ( 2013 , hereafter paper i ) have discovered a new method to compute the initial masses of component stars from the observed masses and luminosity of the secondary component .",
    "this method gives the initial mass range for the secondaries as @xmath0=1.3 - 2.6 m_@xmath1 .",
    "that of the primaries is @xmath2 , which is in very good agreement with the required mass range for the angular momentum loss process via magnetic braking ( tutukov , dremova & svechnikov 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , the initial masses of a- and w - subtypes have completely different ranges for their secondaries : @xmath3 for the former and @xmath4 for the latter . in the present study",
    ", we further discuss some results of paper i and develop new methods for estimation of age and angular momentum loss rates in detached and cb phases .",
    "the formation history of a - subtype cbs is controlled in the pre - contact phase by two effects , namely , nuclear evolution of the massive component ( @xmath0=1.8 - 2.7 m@xmath5 ) and angular momentum evolution of the lighter component ( @xmath6=0.2 - 1.5 m@xmath5 ) .",
    "depending on the initial masses and angular momentum reservoir , the detached phase ends up near the terminal - age of the main - sequence ( tams ) line in the hertzsprung@xmath7russel diagram ( hrd ) . in the precursors of w - subtype cbs , however , both components experience efficient angular momentum loss throughout or during part of their main - sequence ms phase of the massive component . for some of their progenitors ,",
    "angular momentum evolution is so fast that the components may come into contact with each other before the massive component becomes a tams star .",
    "the maximum mass of their massive components is @xmath8 m@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , for stars with @xmath9 m@xmath5 the secondary star is not effective in angular momentum loss process in the early detached phase of binary evolution , but becomes effective as its convective zone deepens during evolution towards the tams line in the hrd .    for a typical a - subtype cb ,",
    "the total initial mass is @xmath10= 3.0 m@xmath5 .",
    "the mean initial masses of the secondary and primary components are @xmath11 and @xmath12=1.0 m@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the mean total initial mass of w - subtype , however , is @xmath13=2.5 , 0.5 m@xmath5 less than that of a - subtype cbs . for w - subtype cbs , @xmath14 m@xmath5 and @xmath15 m@xmath5 .",
    "age determination of w uma - type cbs is very important for a better understanding of binary evolution .",
    "in addition to initial masses , if period ( @xmath16 ) or orbital dimension is estimated at the time of the first overflow ( fof ) , for example , one can compute initial angular momentum and then deduce the rate of angular momentum loss as a first approximation .",
    "a similar computation can also be made for the mass - loss .",
    "the present study also aims to make such computations .",
    "binaries have a variety of periods .",
    "if one of the components is a late - type star in the detached phase , then angular momentum loss causes the orbital period to decrease . if both components are late - type , then angular momentum evolution is nearly twice as fast .",
    "this may be the reason why w uma - type cbs are observed in relatively young open clusters , such as in praesepe .",
    "angular momentum evolution is one of the essential problems in stellar astrophysics and has been the subject of many papers on single or binary stars in the literature ( van t veer 1991 ; eggleton , 2001 ; demircan et al .",
    "2006 ; stpie , 2006 ; gazeas & stpie 2008 ) .",
    "although magnetic braking and tidal locking in binaries with late - type components are very complicated processes , the angular momentum loss rates for such binaries derived by stpie ( 2006 , see also gazeas & stpie 2008 ) and demircan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are very easy to apply .",
    "we compare our results on angular momentum evolution of the detached precursors of w uma - type cbs with these rates ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "the final end stage of evolution of w uma - type cbs is also debated in the literature ( see , e.g. , li et al . 2007 ; eker , demircan & bilir 2008 ) .",
    "the fate of a w uma - type cb essentially depends on the ratio of angular momentum and mass - loss during the contact phase .",
    "these systems seem to be the progenitors of blue stragglers observed in many clusters .",
    "some of the blue stragglers are single stars and it seems reasonable to suppose that these were formed by merging components of w uma - type cbs . in this case , the rate of angular momentum loss is so high that the components merge . on the other hand ,",
    "if mass - loss rate is very high , then the component stars remain separate .",
    "the final form will then consist of either two brown dwarfs ( li et al .",
    "2007 ) or two stars with very low mass . in the latter case",
    ", the age of the stars becomes infinitely long . in order to predict the final products ,",
    "further studies are required for mass and angular momentum loss rates in the w uma - type cb phase .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "some basic results of paper i are summarized and the @xmath17 relation for w uma - type cbs is compared with that of the well - known detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the method for age computation of a- and w - subtype cbs and a comparison of results with cluster member close binaries .",
    "orbital parameters of cbs and their evolution are considered and discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , our concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "the secondary components of the w uma - type cbs are over - luminous and over - sized according to their masses . in paper",
    "i , yildiz and doan consider this to be a result of the initial masses being much higher than the present ( observed ) masses .",
    "they define @xmath18 of a secondary star as the mass according to its observed luminosity ( @xmath19 ) by assuming @xmath20 : @xmath21 .",
    "they construct interior models with mass - loss by using the mesa stellar evolution code ( paxton et al .",
    "2011 ) and find a relation between the mass differences @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the present mass of the secondaries .",
    "the expression derived from these models for initial mass of the secondary components in paper i is a function of the mass difference @xmath25 and @xmath24 : @xmath26 , where the masses are in units of solar mass .",
    "we want to test if @xmath18 is successful in predicting the present radii .",
    "@xmath27 of a- and w - subtypes are plotted with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath18 in figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we use the same data set as in paper i. the components of well - known debs are also shown for comparison ( southworth , debcat : http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk / jkt / debcat/ ) .",
    "the secondary components are very large for their mass @xmath24 .",
    "hilditch , king & mcfarlane ( 1988 ) have found that the radii of secondaries of the w - subtype cbs are 1.5 times larger than normal .",
    "although they have reported much larger factors for the secondaries of a - subtype cbs , we find that the difference between the radii of the secondaries and normal stars is simply 0.5 r_@xmath1 .",
    "for example , a normal star of 0.4 m_@xmath1  has a radius of 0.4 r_@xmath1  ( cu cnc ) , but the radius of a secondary component in an a - subtype cb of the same mass ( aq psc ) is 0.9 r_@xmath1 . for w - subtype",
    ", there is no such single relation but a decreasing difference as mass increases .",
    "the relation between @xmath27 and @xmath18 , however , is very close to the @xmath28 relation for the components of debs .",
    "this is a very good indicator for the fact that the entire structure of a secondary star with @xmath18 is very close to that of a single star with mass @xmath29 .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising because one may expect that the oversized behaviour of a secondary star is mainly determined by the presence of a close companion .    the slight differences between the @xmath17 relation for both a- and w - subtypes and the @xmath28 relation for debs are noticeable for low mass secondaries ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "this is most likely due to the influence of a very close companion ( @xmath32 d and @xmath33 ) on the secondary radius .     in the light of these results",
    "we assume that the secondaries internal structure is similar to that of a star with the mass @xmath34 .",
    "if these stars were isolated with their present features , then their ms lifetime would be given by @xmath18 rather than @xmath35 .",
    "this point has strong significance for our method to compute the ages of w uma - type cbs ( see section 3 ) .",
    "it is well known that the gravitational force between two masses depends on the product of their masses and the inverse square of the distance between them .",
    "we have the initial masses but not the distances between the component stars in their detached phase .",
    "therefore , we consider the product of initial masses ( @xmath36 ) as a measure of tidal interaction . in fig .",
    "2(a ) this product for a- and w - subtypes is plotted with respect to the primary present mass @xmath37 .",
    "the solid line is for the curve fitted to the data .",
    "the present mass of the primary components is strongly dependent on their initial masses .",
    "the other parameters @xmath7 such as initial angular momentum , period and age of systems @xmath7 have no role . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the total initial mass is plotted against @xmath38 .",
    "there is a very clear linear relation between @xmath39 and @xmath38 .",
    "the fitting line is found as @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath38 can be computed from this equation as a function of initial masses ( in solar mass ) : @xmath41 the maximum difference between the observed and computed @xmath38 from equation ( 1 ) is less than 10 per cent .",
    "this implies that the mass of the primary either remains constant or changes very little during the w uma phase .    in fig .",
    "3 , the total initial mass @xmath39 is plotted against the present total mass @xmath42 .",
    "the relation between @xmath39 and @xmath43 is also linear .",
    "the mean difference between @xmath39 and @xmath43 is 1.05 m@xmath5 for a- and 0.82 m@xmath5 for w - subtype cbs .",
    "this shows that the a - subtype cbs have lost , on average , a mass 0.23 m@xmath5 higher than w - subtype cbs .",
    "the data are a bit more scattered in fig . 3 than in fig .",
    "this implies that @xmath24 also depends on some other initial parameters as well as initial masses ( see section 4 ) .",
    "age of a normal star can be found by some methods based on comparison of a computer model and observational parameters .",
    "time variation of stellar parameters allows such methods . for a normal ms star with non - astreoseismic constraints , the highest ( and monotonic ) changing ( observable )",
    "parameters are luminosity and radius . however , these parameters are a very sensitive function of mass , and composition . if uncertainty in mass is high , then an accurate age is difficult to obtain .",
    "if the uncertainty in mass is about 10 per cent , then age uncertainty is about 30 per cent . in comparison ,",
    "the effect of metallicity on age is greater .",
    "for example , a 1.5 m_@xmath1model with solar composition ( x=0.7024 , z=0.0172 ) has an ms lifetime of 2.1 gyr . in comparison",
    "when z=0.0322 , the age for a star of the same mass is 3.2 gyr , a 50 per cent longer ms lifetime .",
    "therefore , any ages we find and estimate have some inherent uncertainty .    on the other hand , even in the cases where we fit interior models to asteroseismic constraints to find an age the agreement with other derived ages can be poor . for alpha centauri a and b , for example , ages from the non - asteroseismic and asteroseismic constraints are found as about 9 gyr and 5.6 - 5.9 gyr ( see , miglio & montalban 2005 ; yildiz 2007a ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , even with the best state - of - the - art observational results there can still be some dispute or uncertainty about the age of a star , this is compounded in the case of binary stars where binary interactions will make it difficult to determine the true age .",
    "this is in addition to the effect of uncertain current / initial stellar composition .",
    "below , we therefore aim to develop a method for determination of the age of observed w uma binaries in terms of the variable of stellar mass only to yield a rough , but useful , stellar age .",
    "as stated by hilditch , king & mcfarlane ( 1988 ) , the secondaries of a - subtype cbs are more evolved than that of w - subtype cbs .",
    "then , we anticipate that the detached phases of precursors of a- and w - subtype cbs are quite different .",
    "the secondary stars at the end of this phase may overflow their roche lobe for two very different reasons : + ( i ) due to rapid expansion after tams or    \\(ii ) due to the roche lobe receding as a result of rapid orbital ( angular momentum ) evolution .",
    "+ in case ( i ) , the detached phase lasts about @xmath44 of the secondary star .",
    "this is simply the formation course of a - subtype . since @xmath45 for a - subtype , the duration of the detached phase ( @xmath46 ) is less than @xmath47 . in case ( ii ) , angular momentum loss rate is high because both components are effective in the detached phase .",
    "this occurs in the precursors of w - subtype cbs .",
    "their detached phase is shorter than the ms lifetime of their secondaries , @xmath48 .",
    "the shortest value of @xmath46 for w - subtype with @xmath49 is @xmath50 ( see below ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is higher than 1.8 @xmath51 , then only the primary component is effective in the angular momentum loss process via magnetic braking .",
    "such binaries become a - subtype .",
    "since their angular momentum evolution is relatively slow , the roche lobe overflow merely starts ( i.e. mass transfer ) after the secondary component completes its ms lifetime .",
    "the mass transfer process obscures stellar quantities such as age .",
    "therefore , it seems to be very difficult to assign age to the w uma - type cbs as they have three different evolutionary phases - namely , detached , semidetached ( sd ) and cb phases .",
    "current age of a cb system ( @xmath52 ) is the summation of durations of three phases .",
    "they are detached ( @xmath46 ) , sd ( @xmath53 ) and contact phases ( @xmath54 ) . then , @xmath55 where @xmath54 is the time from the beginning of contact phase until present . as stated above , for a - subtype",
    "cbs , the time interval for the detached phase is very nearly the same as the ms lifetime of the secondary star : @xmath56 .",
    "one can precisely compute @xmath44 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "yildiz ( 2013 ) derives an expression for @xmath44 from stellar evolution models as @xmath57 the detached phase of the precursor of an a - subtype system lasts slightly longer than the ms lifetime of its massive component [ @xmath58 .",
    "this time interval is very short for systems with high initial mass . on the other hand",
    ", the age of a system with a secondary of mass @xmath34 must be less than @xmath59 , or , more generally , @xmath60 ( see below ) . from these constraints",
    ", we can derive an expression for @xmath61 .",
    "after the detached phase , nuclear and secular evolution develop under control of each other .",
    "the sd phase starts with @xmath0 and @xmath18 is the present presumptive mass according to luminosity .",
    "the upper limit for these binaries , however , is the ms age of a star with a mass of @xmath62 .",
    "the ms age of such an isolated star is @xmath63 . in general , @xmath64 .",
    "perhaps , the most convenient age can be found by using the mean mass of the secondary components during binary evolution : @xmath65 then , we can take @xmath61 as @xmath66 if we insert @xmath67 and equation ( 5 ) in equation ( 2 ) , we find the age of an a - subtype cb : @xmath68     the results of this simple method are listed in table a1 .",
    "the basic properties of these binaries are given in paper i. although age of a cb is a very complicated problem and may be computed in a variety of ways , the present method gives reasonable results .",
    "the average age for the a - subtype cbs is 4.37 gyr .",
    "this value is , surprisingly , in very good agreement with the age found for a - type cbs by bilir et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , 4.48 gyr .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 .    in table a1 , uncertainties in ages of cbs are also listed .",
    "these uncertainties are derived from equation ( 6 ) : @xmath69 the uncertainty in @xmath70 as a function of @xmath71 and @xmath72 is given in equation 11 of paper i. the mean uncertainty given in table 1 is the average of the uncertainties in age of individual binaries listed in table a1 .",
    ".mean ages of a- and w - subtype cbs .",
    "the ages taken from bilir et al .",

    "four binaries are cluster member .",
    "the ages of these binaries are given in table 2 .",
    "if we compare the ages of binaries with those of clusters , we notice that the cluster age is very low for tx cnc .",
    "this system is perhaps the youngest of the whole data set .",
    "the age we find for qx and , however , is twice the cluster age . for the other two binary systems , the age differences seem acceptable . for ah vir , for example , the differences between the three ages are less than 8 per cent .",
    "therefore , it should be stated that our method for age computation is better for a - subtype than for w - subtype .",
    "this is in contrast to the result obtained from comparison of our results with the data of the close binaries in clusters ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "the greatest difference appears for the youngest system tx cnc .",
    "such exceptional binaries must either have very low angular momentum or very high angular momentum loss rate , or both .",
    "however , we notice that the difference between the age of the present study and the cluster age depends on @xmath6 : the smaller the value of @xmath6 , the greater is the difference ( @xmath73 ) .",

    ", it is shown that an additional clue is the @xmath120 relation for secondary stars to support the idea that the structure and evolution of these stars primarily depend on @xmath34 : @xmath17 relation being in good agreement with that of normal stars of detached binaries .    using the initial mass and mass according to luminosity",
    ", a new method is developed for age estimation of a- and w - subtypes .",
    "this is the first time that such a method of age estimation for w uma - type cbs has been derived from the fundamental properties of secondary components .",
    "we apply this method and find that the mean ages of a- and w - subtypes are 4.4 and 4.6 gyr , respectively .",
    "these values are in very good agreement with the kinematic ages found by bilir et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the ages we find are also compared with the ages of cluster member close binaries .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory for stellar age , provided that the binary is not very young .",
    "our data sample contains four cluster member w uma - type cbs ; two a- and two w - subtypes .",
    "the ages we find are in good agreement with the cluster ages , if @xmath6 is about 1 m_@xmath1 .",
    "the difference is great for the cbs with @xmath121 m_@xmath1 .",
    "determination of stellar parameters of such cluster member binaries is very important for our understanding of binary evolution .",
    "we show that there is a strong correlation between the present mass of primary ( @xmath122 ) and the total initial mass ( @xmath39 ) . if we estimate ( @xmath122 ) from this , the difference between the observed and the estimated values of @xmath122 is very small , being less than 10 per cent .",
    "this implies that @xmath122 either remains constant or changes very little during the w uma phase , if at all .",
    "the discovery of initial masses of w uma - type cbs in terms of observed quantities leads us to consider the binary evolution of these systems .",
    "we compute the properties of a - subtype cbs at the time of the fof by using eggleton s ( 1983 ) expression for the effective radius of roche lobe .",
    "the mean distance between the component stars in the former case is about @xmath123 r_@xmath1  and the mean period is @xmath77 d. computation of the period or mean distance enables us to also consider the angular momentum evolution of these systems .",
    "we find that angular momentum at fof is 2.5@xmath710 times greater than the present angular momentum .",
    "that is to say , these systems have lost a great deal of their angular momentum during the contact phase ( sd+cb ) .    for estimation of initial angular momentum in the detached phase , we compare @xmath88 with the angular momentum of the well - known debs .",
    "satisfactory agreement is obtained if the rate of angular momentum loss in the detached phase is directly proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "the rate we derive is in very good agreement with the rates of stpie ( 2006 ) and demircan et al .",
    "we find that @xmath125 r_@xmath1  and @xmath126 d. in addition to the initial mass intervals for the components of w uma - type cbs , we also obtain an upper limit for the initial period .",
    "i would like to thank ros elliot for her help in checking the language of the manuscript .",
