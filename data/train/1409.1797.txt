    "the local group of galaxies , the concentration of perhaps four dozen galaxies around the milky way and m31 , has proved useful for many years as a dynamical and cosmological laboratory . not only does it contain those objects that may be studied in greatest detail ( due to their proximity ) , it was for long the only such structure whose shape in three dimensions was well - understood .    perhaps the first important dynamical study based on the local group was the venerable timing argument of @xcite . making the assumptions that the only significant mass in the group resided in the milky way and m31 and that each of these might be treated as a point particle all the way back to the big bang ,",
    "the resulting estimate of mass for the whole local group was an early indication of the presence of large amounts of dark matter .",
    "the argument was developed by @xcite to include other galaxies in the group , assumed to be massless and on radial trajectories directed toward or away from the barycentre . in spite of the simplistic picture of the group that is assumed ,",
    "the timing argument remains a useful point of reference and updated treatments and versions of it may be found in , for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite pp .",
    "150 , 268 .    a much more sophisticated look at local group dynamics is found in the least action calculations as developed , for instance , in @xcite and found most recently in @xcite . here",
    "the trajectories of the various galaxies are subject to only reasonable restrictions .",
    "the assumptions are retained , however , of the milky way and m31 containing most of the group s mass ( though their masses and those of others are allowed to vary somewhat between solutions ) and of galaxies retaining their identities back to a very early time .",
    "there is no question that galaxies have mass or that the milky way and m31 have rather a lot of it .",
    "but the assumption of a close relation between mass and light remains an assumption on scales of , say , 100kpc to several mpc , and therefore should be examined if possible .",
    "this is especially so when there are indications pointing toward its modification .",
    "@xcite found significant discrepancies between the parameters of n - body simulations and the corresponding quantities calculated by treating the simulations as a least - action problem , discrepancies they attributed to the presence of ` orphan ' dark - matter haloes containing no galaxies .",
    "more recently , @xcite discovered that the kinematics of nearby galaxy groups does not match that expected qualitatively , a discrepancy that @xcite attribute again to ` orphan ' dark - matter haloes .",
    "along similar lines to @xcite , @xcite work out a correction for the timing argument based on more recent n - body work .",
    "motivated by the picture of dark matter being far more extended than visible galaxies , in their examination of the fate of the local group , @xcite assume a diffuse intergalactic medium containg as much mass as the two major galaxies .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to discard the assumption of light tracing mass and see how far we can go without it . in particular , what can the motions alone of galaxies within the local group tell us about its mass distribution ?",
    "* we will use galaxies as tracers of the velocity field , and ( assuming velocities to be due to gravity ) use the velocity field to infer the mass distribution .",
    "in particular we are looking to see whether the inferred mass matches the location of visible galaxies , or perhaps indicates the existence of dynamically important ` orphan haloes ' or an extended dark - matter halo .",
    "*      we will assume that there is a mass concentration associated with the local group , such as to produce an identifiable centre .",
    "next , on consideration of crossing times , the group ( at least beyond a certain distance from the centre ) must still be in the process of infall , and it is plausible that speeds of infall will be larger closer to the centre .",
    "outside a certain radius galaxies will physically moving away , though more slowly than in the general hubble flow .",
    "the situation is sketched in fig . 1 .    *",
    "this assumption of a mass concentration and radial infall is plausible , but must be checked when possible .",
    "some possible signs indicating failure are mentioned below . *    as observed from a position outside the centre and participating in the infall , radial velocities will be positive toward the centre and away it ; very negative on the far side ; and smaller in magnitude looking off this axis , for purely geometric reasons .",
    "close to the centre the picture may be complicated by galaxies that have fallen in from the far side and are on their way out again , but in any case the maximum observed radial speeds ( positive or negative ) will be in the direction of the centre and directly away from it . within this picture , then , the direction of maximum magnitude of radial velocities will point toward the centre of the group .",
    "the distance to the centre will be signaled by a sudden shift from positive to negative radial velocities or by a mixture of positive and negative velocities in some region .",
    "the picture need not be exact to be useful",
    ". in particular , the centre itself may be unoccupied by anything observable , and the velocity field may have holes in it at any point .",
    "small - scale deviations and uncorrelated motions should average out , though in a sparsely - sampled group they might not do so as well as we would wish .",
    "conversely , a direction of maximum radial speeds can be calculated for any situation , even one in which there is no identifiable centre , or in which the field of velocities does not have an overall pattern .",
    "we could detect the latter cases by taking various subsets of the observations and performing a calculation : the direction would fluctuate strongly depending on the particular galaxies included . in the case of the local group ,",
    "if mass indeed follows light we expect the centre to lie in the direction of m31 .",
    "an offcentre mass concentration within the group with galaxies around it will show a large radial - velocity signal not associated with the group as a whole ; how this is dealt with in the case of m31 and the milky way is set out below .",
    "for this calculation we must correct heliocentric radial velocities for the motion of the sun around the galaxy , a correction that is not as accurately known as one might like , but we may use the resulting galactocentric radial velocities with no further correction .",
    "in attempting an analysis of the dynamics of the local group one must first decide where its limits are . including galaxies in the neighboring galaxy groups",
    "risks distorting one s conclusions by the actions of masses there , so no objects beyond 1.5mpc should be used ; and those close to the border should be scrutinised for possible disturbance . for our purposes",
    "a near limit needs to be chosen also . including the many satellite galaxies of the milky way and",
    "m31 would show that those dominant galaxies have significant mass concentrations , which is not in question .",
    "but we seek kinematic clues to mass distribution on a larger scale , so satellites must be excluded .",
    "how far out the influence of the bright galaxies dominates kinematics is not clear ; @xcite discovered evidence that m33 , over 200kpc from m31 , may have been influenced by the latter significantly . for the following calculations i adopt 200kpc as a standard cutoff distance , though i will occasionally explore others .",
    "data for galaxies used in the kinematic centre calculations were taken from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , with the particular help of ian steers .",
    "all galaxies within 1.5mpc of either the milky way or m31 were initially selected , and those objects that are clearly part of the galactic or andromeda systems ( such as the sagittarius galaxy , now being cannibalised , and a few globular clusters ) removed .",
    "objects without a radial velocity could not be used and were dropped .",
    "some of the averaged distances listed in ned were adjusted to give greater weight to newer and more accurate results . from the list of 44 galaxies thus obtained , an initial cut to remove satellite galaxies within 100kpc of m31 or the milky way brought the total down to 33 ; most of the calculations were done on a final set of 25 using a 200kpc cut .",
    "the galaxies and relevant data are listed in table  [ data ] .",
    "the data here used for the 25-galaxy set are almost identical with the slightly larger sample of @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the final 25-galaxy sample on the sky is shown in fig .",

    "we need to look more closely at our picture of infall .",
    "we suppose that small galaxies are falling into the general gravitational potential of the local group , trading potential energy for kinetic .",
    "we have @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the velocity at some chosen distance where the gravitational potential is @xmath110 . if the components of the local group started their infall with zero velocity at an infinite distance , or at any rate from so far away that @xmath110 may be neglected , the infall velocity varies with distance as @xmath111 which , with the point - mass potential of @xmath112 , gives the @xmath113 curve that is not quite good enough .",

    "trying some exotic dynamics , one can generate a promising - looking curve by pairing a point mass with a linear repulsion term .",
    "unfortunately , to show a good fit to the galactocentric radial velocity data the repulsion term must be orders of magnitude larger than the observed cosmological constant or dark energy . modified newtonian dynamics ( mond , @xcite ) does not fit into the picture at all , since it has a logarithmic potential ( and thus one can not have galaxies falling in from infinity ) .",
    "several obvious ways to relax our simplifying assumptions do not help .",
    "we could allow galaxies to have different total energies , that is , different @xmath118 radii .",
    "however , that would only flatten the @xmath119 function , as closer galaxies would fall in from smaller radii and thus have lower velocities than before",
    ". it might be possible to arrange things so that the closer galaxies have systematically fallen in from farther away , overtaking the slower ones ; but this is contrived and seems unlikely .",
    "we could allow some angular momentum , so that galaxies do not fall along strictly radial orbits .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that , in his n - body simulations that galaxies crossing the virial radius of a dark - matter halo had tangential speeds similar to radial speeds . but this also would flatten the @xmath119 function , as potential energy is transformed into tangential motion that ( unless carefully arranged to be always away from the milky way ) would be unobservable , or show up only as noise . in any case , the virial radius of any dark - matter halo is , as we have seen , likely to be smaller than this kind of analysis can distinguish .",
    "we can not get a steeper potential well than that of a point mass , clearly . but",
    "by relaxing one of our assumptions we can add higher - order terms to the potential .",
    "if we have two point masses a distance @xmath120 apart , the first two terms in the multipole expansion are    @xmath121    where @xmath122 is the total mass , @xmath123 the distance from the centre of mass and @xmath124 depends on the mass ratio , being 1/4 for equal masses and 2/9 for a 2:1 ratio . using this potential",
    "as we did for the nfw and lynden - bell profiles , we get the zero - velocity curves of fig .",
    "[ quadrupole ] .",
    "two separated masses clearly fit the observations better than any sort of centered mass profile .",
    "a distance of 1 mpc between the milky way and andromeda is already a significant improvement over a point mass , and 2 mpc may be a reasonable estimate of the time - averaged distance between the two galaxies .",
    "3 mpc fits just a bit better  but at this point the assumption that @xmath125 , upon which the multipole expansion depends , has completely broken down .",
    "we are at the limit of what our simple picture can deliver .    to check the effect of another of our simplifying assumptions , that of cylindrical symmetry about the milky way - andromeda axis , consider the local group projected perpendicular to that axis .",
    "it is rather flattened , stretching almost 2.5 mpc from tucana on one side to sextans a on the other but less than 1.4 mpc along a perpendicular line from ngc 3109 to sagdig .",
    "if we separate the two sides of this very rough plane , like opening a book in the centre , and plot the information in fig .",
    "[ quadrupole ] again , we arrive at fig .  [ duplex ] .",
    "comparing the two sides , we see that the zero - radial - velocity curve is somewhat farther to the left on the top than on the bottom .",
    "the difference , however , is not great , and depends upon one or two galaxies .",
    "overall , the symmetry holds up ; we are not being misled by a couple of rogue objects .",
    "but it is also clear that the local group population is sparse in the interesting regions and any further analysis must be done in a more sophisticated way .",
    "the primary conclusions of this study are not surprising , but neither are they trivial .",
    "it has long been assumed that the centre of mass of the local group lies in the direction of m31 and that the milky way and m31 have most of the mass .",
    "confirmation of these _ assumptions _ have been arrived at purely kinematically , using the plausible picture of infall but without introducing any relations between light and mass at all .",
    "they rule out any extended dark matter halo in the group as a whole , as well as any dynamically significant population of orphan haloes .",
    "( they do _ not _ rule out orphan haloes entirely  those are alive and well among n - body researchers ; see , for example , @xcite  but the local group s orphans do not seem to have the dynamic effect that those in other nearby groups have . ) they agree with a very recent dynamical study @xcite , approaching the problem in quite a different way . in addition , it has been shown that the region from which the local group has been assembled is much larger than its present volume , large enough that the gravitational potential of most galaxies at the beginning of infall ( strictly speaking , the differences between them ) were negligible .",
    "this could be a very useful result .",
    "an important secondary conclusion is that the kinematics of the local group is _ not _ well - sampled by the visible galaxies .",
    "in fact their sparseness and asymmetry managed to fool statistical techniques of moderate sophistication .",
    "the local group can be a misleading place ! in turn",
    "we reach the conclusion that , while things like extended group haloes and dynamically important orphan haloes are clearly worse fits to the data , it is very difficult to arrive at a convincing numerical estimate of how much worse they are .",
    "a minor point is that a plausible algorithm ( here , a shape correction term ) may not have the desired effect . in this case , moving from the @xmath86 to the @xmath90 and @xmath89 quantities made the results even more deceiving .",
    "many years later , the basic simplifying assumptions of @xcite have been justified .",
    "although the sophistication of the dynamical analyses applied to the local group has increased tremendously , the results have been overall a process of refinement rather than revolution .",
