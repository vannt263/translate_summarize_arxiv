    "in december 2015 the atlas and cms collaborations have reported excesses in the search for resonances decaying into pairs of photons for diphoton invariant masses around 750  gev  @xcite . in atlas",
    ", excesses appeared in the two @xmath7 bins 710750  gev ( 14 events vs. 6.3 expected ) and 750 - 790  gev ( 9 events vs. 5.0 expected ) , with a local significance of @xmath8 ( assuming a large width of @xmath9  gev ; @xmath10 in the narrow width approximation ) . in cms , excesses appear in the @xmath7 bin 750770  gev for photons in the ebeb category ( 5 events vs. 1.9 expected ) and ebee category ( 6 events vs. 3.5 expected ) , but less in the bin 730 - 750  gev ( 4 events vs. 2.1 expected for photons in the ebeb category , 1 event vs. 4.0 expected for photons in the ebee category , considered as less sensitive ) .",
    "the local significance of the excesses is @xmath11 for cms in the narrow width approximation .",
    "the global significances of the signals of @xmath12 are not overwhelming and compatible with statistical fluctuations . still",
    ", the fact that the region of invariant diphoton masses is very similar for atlas and cms has stirred quite some excitement resulting in a huge number of possible explanations .",
    "( the number of proposed models exceeds the number of observed signal events . )",
    "fits to the combined data should , in principle , also consider the informations from diphoton searches at 8  tev  @xcite where a mild excess was observed by cms .",
    "however , the extrapolation of signal cross sections from 8 to 13 tev depends on the assumed production mechanism  @xcite . assuming the production of a resonance around 750  gev by gluon fusion ( ggf ) , combined fits to the signal cross sections at 13 tev are in the range 2 - 10  fb  @xcite , with slightly better fits and a larger signal cross section assuming a larger width of 30 - 45  gev  @xcite .",
    "it is notoriously difficult to construct a consistent model for such a resonance `` @xmath13 '' : its production channel in proton proton collisions is typically assumed to be ggf through loops of colored particles",
    ". if these are the quarks of the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath13 would decay into them leaving little branching fraction for @xmath13-decays into @xmath14 , which has to be generated by loop diagrams as well .",
    "accordingly simple two higgs doublet ( or mssm ) extensions of the standard model , which could contain a resonance @xmath13 near 750  gev  @xcite , require additional scalars or vector - like fermions whose loops generate the coupling of @xmath13 to gluons and/or @xmath14 ( unless @xmath0-parity is broken  @xcite ) .",
    "large yukawa couplings are required for a sufficiently large cross section , which risk to generate new hierarchy problems / landau singularities ( unless compositeness is invoked ) .",
    "also in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( nmssm ) it has been argued  @xcite that additional vector - like quark superfields have to be introduced . in",
    "@xcite a two - step decay cascade involving the two pseudoscalars of the nmssm with masses of about 750  gev and 850  gev has been proposed which requires , however , to tune the corresponding mixing angle close to  0 .",
    "a different approach towards an explanation of the diphoton events is to consider that a single photon in the detector can represent a collimated bunch of photons ( typically two of them ) which originate from a single very light state , for instance a light pseudoscalar @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "then the observed processes correspond to an initial resonance @xmath13 decaying into a pair @xmath16 , where @xmath15 must have a mass below @xmath17  gev for the resulting photons to be sufficiently collimated .",
    "this scenario opens the possibility to explain the diphoton events in different models which can accomodate resonances @xmath13 and a light pseudoscalar @xmath15 . in this paper",
    "we show that the simple @xmath18-invariant nmssm belongs to this class of models .",
    "( this has also been observed in  @xcite . )    in the nmssm ( see  @xcite for reviews ) , two cp - even higgs states beyond the standard model - like higgs ( subsequently denoted as @xmath19 ) can play the role of a resonance @xmath13 . in terms of weak eigenstates ,",
    "a singlet - like state @xmath20 can have a large coupling to a pair of mostly singlet - like pseudoscalars @xmath21 , originating from a cubic singlet self coupling @xmath22 in the superpotential ( see below ) .",
    "however , a coupling to quarks or gluons inside protons has to be induced by a mixing of @xmath20 with one of the two su(2 ) doublet - like higgs states .",
    "if this state is @xmath19 , the mixing reduces the couplings of @xmath19 to sm particles ( notably @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) and is severely constrained  @xcite by the measured signal rates by atlas and cms  @xcite .",
    "an alternative is that @xmath20 mixes strongly with the other `` mssm''-like cp - even state @xmath25 .",
    "then the physical eigenstates  preferably both of them with masses near 750  gev  can profit from an enhancement of the couplings of @xmath25 to @xmath26-quarks by @xmath27 , leading to sufficiently large signal cross sections into the @xmath28 ( and hence diphoton ) final state via associated production with @xmath26-quarks .",
    "given the diphoton mass resolution of the detectors and the slightly preferred large width of the excess it is clear that two ( narrow ) cp - even states near 750  gev , mixtures of @xmath25 and @xmath20 , can also provide a good fit to the data .",
    "( a similar scenario has been discussed in  @xcite . ) for one of the benchmark points presented below ( bp1 ) the signal originates , however , from one cp - even state only , the other one being significantly heavier .",
    "a light pseudoscalar can appear in the nmssm in the form of a pseudo - goldstone boson ( pgb ) .",
    "a priori two global symmetries can lead to such pgbs : first , a peccei - quinn symmetry emerges in the limit @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath30 is required for the couplings of the heavy higgs states to @xmath28 .",
    "second , the scalar potential of the nmssm is invariant under an @xmath0-symmetry  @xcite if the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings @xmath31 and @xmath32 vanish , leading to a pgb due to its spontaneous breakdown by the phenomenologically required vacuum expectation values .",
    "we find indeed , that the interesting part of the parameter space of the nmssm corresponds to small values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , since the @xmath0-symmetry is broken by radiative corrections to the scalar potential involving the necessarily non - vanishing gaugino masses and trilinear couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 , it helps only partially to explain a very light pseudoscalar @xmath21 .",
    "still , it represents a `` go - theorem '' showing that a standard supersymmetric extension of the sm  without additional vector - like quarks and/or leptons  could explain the observed diphoton excess .",
    "different assumptions on the mass of @xmath21 can be made . for one set of scenarios we assume @xmath35  mev , just below the @xmath36 threshold .",
    "these scenarios lead to visibly displaced vertices from the @xmath37 decays . for a large value of the nmssm trilinear coupling @xmath38",
    ", the signal can originate from a single higgs state near 750  gev .",
    "for smaller values of @xmath22 , the signal can originate from two higgs states with masses near 750  gev . for another set of scenarios we assume @xmath39  mev , not far from the @xmath40 mass . for @xmath41 near 550  mev , @xmath21 mixes with the @xmath40 meson and inherits its decays into @xmath14 and @xmath42 ; the latter lead to photon - jets . for @xmath41 near 510  mev , constraints from searches for radiative @xmath43 decays into @xmath44 by cleo  @xcite are alleviated , but estimates of the @xmath21 decay widths are more uncertain .",
    "but in both cases the @xmath21 life time is short enough avoiding macroscopically displaced vertices , and two higgs states near 750  gev can generate a signal .    in the next section we describe with the help of analytic approximations to the mass matrices ( including only the dominant radiative corrections ) which region in the parameter space of the nmssm can generate the diphoton events . in section  3",
    "we discuss various constraints from low energy physics on light pseudoscalars , and discuss separately the different scenarios .",
    "benchmark points are presented with the help of the public fortran code nmssmtools  @xcite . in the final section  4",
    "we summarize and discuss possible alternative signatures , which could help to distinguish different scenarios if the excess survives the next runs of the lhc .",
    "we consider the cp - conserving @xmath18-invariant nmssm .",
    "the superpotential of the higgs sector reads in terms of hatted superfields w_=_u_d + ^3 .",

    "the advantage of this basis is that only the component @xmath58 of the higgs doublets acquires a vev @xmath59 and that , for typical parameter choices , it is nearly diagonal : @xmath58 has sm - like couplings to fermions and electroweak gauge bosons , the heavy doublet field @xmath60 is the cp - even partner of the mssm - like cp - odd state @xmath61 , while @xmath62 remains a pure singlet .",

    "additional constraints depending on @xmath41 will be discussed in the corresponding subsections below .      for a light @xmath21 , too light for hadronic final states ( @xmath41 below @xmath125 ) , the possible decays are into @xmath126 , @xmath111 and the loop induced decay into @xmath14 .",
    "the couplings of @xmath21 to standard model fermions are obtained via mixing with @xmath61 as discussed in eqs .   and in the previous section , and lead to a reduced coupling of @xmath21 to leptons @xmath127 , see .",
