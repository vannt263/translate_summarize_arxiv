    "the detection of gravitational waves is based on laser interferometry used to monitor the relative displacement of suspended masses@xcite . although the first generation of gw detectors has been concluded with an extraordinary success , the event rate at the level of sensitivity of these detectors is about one per year in the most optimistic predictions and the absence of a detected signal in the 3 years of data taking is totally compatible with the event rate uncertainty .",
    "therefore , a second generation of detectors is being built in usa ( advanced ligo@xcite ) , in europe ( advanced virgo@xcite ) and in japan ( kagra@xcite ) . in these advanced detectors the sensitivity limit in displacement is about @xmath7 over a wide band centred around @xmath8 . the sensitivity limit of the detector advanced virgo , with its main noise components , is shown in fig.[fig_avirgocurve ] . lowering the noise level by a certain factor corresponds to increase by the same factor the maximum distance at which a source can be detected .",
    "the larger this distance , the higher the event rate because the larger the number of galaxies present in the detection range . from fig.[fig_avirgocurve ] one can see that the thermal noise coming from the mirror coatings ( coating brownian noise ) is the limiting noise component in the band where the detector is most sensitive . to clearly understand that , it is important to know that during the detector designing process , in general , the noise that comes from the optical readout system ( quantum noise ) is shaped to match the displacement noise level .",
    "if the coating noise gets reduced the quantum noise follows , either by a simple adjustment of optical parameters or by a major redesign of the optical readout@xcite , depending on the level of noise reduction to attain .",
    "the reflective coating on the suspend masses are made by stacks of alternate layers of two transparent materials having different refractive index .",
    "after a long process of selection two materials have been chosen for the optical coating of gw detectors : silica ( sio@xmath9 , low index ) and titanium - doped tantala ( ti : ta@xmath9o@xmath10 , high index ) . the selection has been made on the basis of the lowest optical absorption and thermal noise level@xcite .",
    "lowering coating thermal noise will be beneficial also for other precision measurements where high finesse optical cavities are used , such as in the development of optical clocks@xcite as well as in the field of quantum opto - mechanics .    in amorphous materials",
    "thermal noise comes from unknown relaxation processes whose characteristics are fairly well explained by a model called asymmetric double well potential@xcite . in the case of bulk silica , a well known amorphous material , a number of measurements indicate that the relaxation comes from the twisting of sio@xmath11 tetrahedrons one respect to the nearest . for other materials like coated tantala , that has a higher noise level than coated silica , data are few in absolute terms , and measurements indicating the parts of the microscopic structure responsible of the relaxations are totally missing .",
    "recent works@xcite have started to correlate mechanical loss of tantala to features in the reduced density function measured by electron diffraction .",
    "the results are promising .",
    "direct measurement of thermal noise in multilayered coating was done on macroscopic optics for the first time in caltech@xcite and a work that aims at the thermal noise of the different components of the multistack is in preparation@xcite by the same group . in the present work coatings",
    "are studied by observing the difference of thermal noise on micro oscillators ( micro - cantilevers ) before and after the coating deposition .",
    "following saulson  @xcite we describe the cantilever by a simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) with anelastic damping : its mechanical response function @xmath12 linking the external force @xmath13 to the deflection @xmath14 writes in the fourier space  @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 the angular frequency , @xmath17 the angular resonance frequency , @xmath18 the cantilever stiffness and @xmath19 its loss angle ( also named mechanical loss or damping ) . in general @xmath19",
    "may be frequency dependent ( in this case @xmath18 is frequency dependent too ) , in the model shown here it is assumed to be constant : this is called _",
    "structural damping_. the quality factor of the resonance is @xmath20 ) .",
    "the thermal noise at room temperature @xmath21 is then simply obtained through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite ( fdt ) : the deflection thermal noise power spectrum density ( psd ) @xmath22 is @xmath23 \\label{eq : fdt}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 the boltzmann s constant . far below resonance , we immediately get the expression of the noise at low frequency : @xmath25 the signature of a structural damping is thus a @xmath26 noise at low frequency . in macroscopic bodies mechanical thermal noise is too low",
    "to be directly measured by relatively simple detectors .",
    "this is the reason why the investigation on thermal noise is almost always done indirectly through the measurement of the mechanical energy loss that is always present in the phenomenon of relaxation .",
    "when the scale of samples is reduced below 1 mm two positive effects happen : i ) the elastic constant @xmath18 approaches @xmath27 , hence thermal noise level increases up to a level ( @xmath28 ) attainable by relatively simple optical readout systems as the one used in this work ; ii ) the lowest resonant frequency is at several khz , below that frequency the cantilever dynamics is equivalent to a massless spring and equation ( [ eq_thnssimple ] ) holds .",
    "we will show in this article that using thermal noise of commercial afm cantilevers , the coating internal dissipation can be measured down to a level of @xmath29 with a good precision on a large frequency range ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this articles is organized as follows : section [ sec : interferometer ] presents the interferometer that has been used to measure directly the thermal noise on the micro cantilevers .",
    "section [ sec : samples ] describes the micro cantilevers that have been tested and the coatings that have been deposited .",
    "section [ sec : dataanalysis ] will show how the interferometric data have been analyzed to extract the relevant parameters of the oscillator .",
    "section [ sec : dilution ] is dedicated to the theory that have been applied to work out the relation between the coating loss angle and the one related to the entire oscillator .",
    "for the first time a technique based on the frequency shifts has been applied to give a measurement of the dilution factor and of the coating loss .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] , the conclusions are drawn .",
    "our measurements of the micro - cantilever deflection rely on a quadrature phase differential interferometer  @xcite .",
    "the optical path difference is measured between the sensing and reference beams focused respectively on the free end and close to the clamping base of the cantilever ( see inset of figure [ fig_cantilever ] ) .",
    "the use of the light polarization allows extending the linear range of the instrument from the sub - wavelength range , typical of a michelson interferometer , to several micrometers . in this way",
    "one can avoid the control of the reference mirror position to find the optimal working point ( middle fringe position ) .",
    "moreover , by design the interferometer is nearly common path , resulting in a low sensitivity to external vibration and a low drift , allowing precise measurements of mechanical thermal noise",
    ". + the total light intensity on the cantilever is less than @xmath31 at @xmath32 , resulting in a negligible heating with respect to room temperature ( less than @xmath33 ) .",
    "the background noise of the instrument is measured by reflection of light on a macroscopic rigid mirror , tuning light intensity on the photodiodes to the same values measured during the thermal noise measurement on the cantilevers . as seen in figure [ fig_psdsilica ] , this background noise @xmath34 is as low as @xmath35 at high frequency , it mainly results from the shot noise of the photodiodes . at lower frequency , @xmath26 noise from the electronics",
    "is present , with a corner frequency around @xmath36 .",
    "+ more details about the instrument can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "this set - up has notably been used previously to characterize mechanical thermal noise and viscoelastic behavior of metallic coatings on micro - cantilevers  @xcite .",
    "the samples are made of tipless afm cantilevers@xcite with thin films of silica @xmath37 or tantala @xmath38 deposited through ion beam sputtering ( ibs ) .",
    "a cantilever used in this experiment is shown in fig.[fig_cantilever ] .    .",
    "the photo should show the irregularity of the width and of the slanted faces due to the etching process . in the inset : position of the laser beams relative to the cantilever.,width=278 ]    the cross section has the shape of a isosceles trapezium with dimensions @xmath39 ( the long side ) , @xmath40 ( the short side ) both measured by the electron microscope .",
    "the thickness is @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the cantilever coated with tantala and silica respectively , as measured indirectly through the resonant frequencies ( from a linear fit between the frequencies of the firsts 3 modes and the mode number squared ) . before the coating deposition",
    "a side view of the cantilever with the electron microscope was not possible and the slanted lateral surfaces made the direct measurement of thickness very inaccurate .",
    "the total length of the cantilever is @xmath43 .",
    "+ although the uniformity of the thickness of the thin film is below @xmath44 over @xmath45 of substrate , during the deposition the cantilever bent considerably under the coating stress and this might have an effect on the thickness uniformity . in a second imaging session , using a different microscope , a measurements of coating thickness was done on the two sides of the cantilever at different points along its length . a side view of the cantilever is shown in fig [ fig_sideview ] .",
    "the measurements show that the coating thickness is uniform within the reading uncertainty of 10% . in order to have a small residual curvature the thickness of the deposited coating has to be different for the two sides of the cantilever because the cross section has the form of a trapeze . with the thicknesses listed in table [ table_samples ]",
    "the inclination of the tip was less than @xmath46 with respect to the cantilever base .",
    ": side view at the middle of the cantilever .",
    "measurement of the total coating thickness @xmath47 ( sum of the coatings deposited on the narrow and wide sides ) and total cantilever thickness @xmath48 are shown . @xmath47 and @xmath49 are respectively 12% and 2% higher than the values that come from the parameters reported in table [ table_samples ] . at right : sketch of the coated - cantilever cross section that helps to understand the electron microscope image.,width=336 ]    the silica coating could be measured right after deposition ( sample * si * ) , and after annealing @xmath50 at @xmath51 ( sample * si*@xmath52 ) .",
    "the cantilever used for the tantala film had a thermal oxide of @xmath53 grown before deposition .",
    "the parameters of the heat treatment are : heating rate of @xmath54 up to @xmath55 and then after 1 minute cooled to room temperature at the same rate .",

    "direct measurement of thermal noise on micro cantilevers coated with tantala and silica have been performed in the frequency range from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the measurement were used to characterize the noise properties of the two amorphous materials deposited by ibs .",
    "the characterizing parameter used here is the loss angle @xmath19 that allows the calculation of thermal noise in any system where the same coating is deposited .",
    "the loss angle of annealed @xmath51 tantala and silica are independent of frequency whereas as - deposited silica shows a slight dependence on frequency as @xmath56 .",
    "the measurements of coating loss done with direct measurement of thermal noise were compared with measurements on some 3 \" diameter silicon wafers using the resonant method .",
    "the wafers were coated using the same coater and the same coating parameters as for the micro cantilevers .",
    "the dilution factors were both calculated and measured .",
    "the results of these measurements are shown in table [ tab : phiwafers ] .",
    "the loss angle measurements made by thermal noise method are in a fairly good agreement with the values obtained by the resonant method . in particular , the values obtained for tantala are in agreement within the experimental uncertainties . for as - coated silica",
    "the comparison shows a significant disagreement that might be explained by a large variability on the optical and mechanical parameters that has been observed by the authors on the as - coated samples .",
    "the annealing process , beside lowering both optical and mechanical losses , contributes to stabilize their values .",
    "a comparison can be made also with results@xcite,@xcite of coating deposited on silicon substrates and measured by the resonant method obtained by other authors .",
    "their results for the loss of tantala annealed at different temperatures are in the range @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "the direct measurement of thermal noise done on micro cantilever as compared to the resonant method applied on larger substrates offer a smaller statistical uncertainty on the measurement of the loss angle and the possibility to cover continuously more than 3 decades of frequency . at the moment",
    "the major uncertainty comes from the systematic error related to the poor knowledge of the uncoated substrate noise . a lower residual gas pressure and greater statistics will lower this uncertainty .",
