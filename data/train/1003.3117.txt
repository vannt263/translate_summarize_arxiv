    "a systematic approach for deriving approximations of nonadiabatic quantum dynamics has been proposed some time ago  @xcite : one can start from the heisenberg equations of motion of the system and perform a partial wigner transform  @xcite over only the degrees of freedom of the bath . in such a way",

    ", such a wigner - heisenberg representation leads to an exact formulation of quantum dynamics . for more general baths , a linear approximation of the propagator leads to a hybrid quantum - classical representation  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "time evolution is dictated by what is known as quantum - classical liouville equation  @xcite .",

    "controllable approximations lead to a consistent formulation of nonadiabatic dynamics , which is energy - conserving and correctly describes the back - reaction mentioned above . from the computational point of view , this requires one to evaluate statistically the propagator in terms of a stochastic process describing the occurrence of quantum transitions : wigner - heisenberg quantum mechanics can be represented in terms of piecewise adiabatic trajectories of the bath coordinates , interspersed by stochastic transitions between the energy levels of the subsystem . despite the elegance of such an approach , the growth in time of the amplitude of the statistical fluctuations has so far somewhat limited the length of the time interval that can be explored . in order to tame this problem",
    "two approaches must be combined .",
    "the first is to develop more accurate approximations for the short - time expression of the wigner - heisenberg propagator  @xcite .",

    ", we discuss in detail how a sampling scheme recently introduced in  @xcite can dramatically improve the numerical stability of the calculations at long time ( depending upon the numerical parameters , the time span can be up to an order of magnitude longer than in previous schemes ) .",
    "our sampling method is based upon a suitable generalization of the transition probability that effectively filters some trajectories which would cause an excessive energy fluctuation , within an approximate representation of the back - reaction .",
