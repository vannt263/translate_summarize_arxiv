    "hidden photons and axion - like - particles ( alps ) turn out to be prime wispy dark matter candidates , c.f .",
    "for example @xcite .",
    "hidden photons can be described by the following kinetic mixing lagrangian  @xcite ( for a review c.f .",
    ", e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the ordinary and hidden photon field strength linked to the gauge fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 is the mass of the hidden photons and @xmath7 denotes the coupling to matter . solving the equations of motion one finds for a hidden photon momentum mode",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 describes the ordinary electric field coupled to matter and @xmath11 the hidden photon field .",
    "analogous equations are obtained for the axion in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "considering a plane conducting surface ( or a mirror ) the ordinary electromagnetic part in eq .   will cause electron movements on the surface , such that @xmath12    we showed in @xcite ( c.f . also @xcite ) that for a dark matter incident angle @xmath13 this causes an emission of a plane electromagnetic wave under the angle @xmath14 with the dark matter velocity @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the emission occurs almost perpendicular to the surface and can therefore be focused by a spherical surface in its center @xcite .",
    "recent experiments using this method are for example described in @xcite and an advanced setup is discussed in  @xcite .    for a spherical mirror with a curvature radius @xmath16",
    "we can calculate the intensity distribution in the center of the sphere in the ray approximation and obtain for a dark matter incident with angle @xmath17 rotated around the y - axis of the detector and velocity @xmath18 @xmath19 ^ 2+y^2+r^2\\cos^{2}(\\theta)v^2\\right)^{3/2 } } & { \\rm for } &   \\vartheta_{0}\\leq \\vartheta_{sp , max } \\\\ 0 & { \\rm for } & \\vartheta_{0 } > \\vartheta_{sp , max } \\end{array}\\ ] ]     r[1em]0.45        where @xmath20 is the aparture angle of the sphere ; the result is normalized to the total power flux generated by a full half sphere with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 figure  [ fig : directional - dist ] illustrates its basic properties .",
    "this may be used to perform a directionally sensitive dark matter search and gives direct implications on the directional resolution , but also on discovery experiments . for more details c.f .",
    "@xcite . in this note",
    "we are going to investigate the validity of this result for long dark matter wavelengths @xmath23 to infer limitations on the directional sensitivity .",
    "for a correct calculation at high wavelengths one has to integrate over elementary waves emitted from the surface of the sphere .",
    "again , this ansatz needs to fulfill eq .  .",
    "one can show that for a plane surface the far - field part of a classical dipole field is sufficient when integrating over the whole surface . at distance @xmath24 from its origin",
    "it is given by ( except time dependence ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the photon wavenumber and @xmath27 the dipole - vector . in order to fulfill   one",
    "needs to set ( up to constant and spatial phase which we discuss below ) @xmath28 thus , @xmath27 is a scaled projection of the dark matter polarization vector on the spherical surface .    the electric field at detector position @xmath29",
    "is then given by @xmath30 and the magnetic field analogous , while @xmath27 is chosen as above ( and thus depends on @xmath24 ) , and @xmath31 .",
    "the factor @xmath32 accounts for the spatial phase differences between the elementary waves induced by the dark matter wave .",
    "the intensity on the detector can be then obtained by evaluating the time - averaged poynting - vector @xmath33 while @xmath34",
    "[ sec : stationary ] when the dark matter wavelength exceeds the setup size , i.e. @xmath35 , dark matter oscillations appear stationary in the setup and directional resolution will be lost .",
    "if we further incoherently average over all dark matter polarizations and consider a spherical cap ( as typical in most experimental setups ) , the direction of the field vectors becomes unimportant and we may use a simplified scalar ansatz @xmath36    we can now easily compute the intensity in the center of the detector @xmath37 , since @xmath38 is just a constant phase and @xmath39 constant over the whole sphere .",
    "we find @xmath40 while the width dependence is obtained recalling that the total emitted power is @xmath41 .",
    "to infer effects for arbitrary hidden photon mass , we evaluated eq .   numerically .",
    "our results are consistent with ray approximation for small wavelengths and sec .",
    "[ sec : stationary ] for large wavelengths .",
    "r0.48        for intermediate wavelengths smaller than expected distribution widths , the results from ray approximation get reproduced with overlaying interference effects as exemplified on the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : distributions ] .",
    "we evaluated major distribution properties for a broad range of wavelengths , such as the distribution full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition - width ] . in the stationary regime",
    "the width is consistently proportional to the photon wavelength and converges for smaller wavelengths towards the ray approximated width in an oscillatory manner due to interference effects .",
    "all numerical results confirm the stationary and ray approximated widths @xmath42 comparing them also determines which of the two is dominant .",
    "the transition between stationary case and ray approximation happens from where both quantities are roughly the same to where the stationary width becomes one order smaller than the ray approximated width .",
    "specifying the setup geometry by @xmath43 we find that the expected distributions may be classified as @xmath44 for experiments aiming for directional sensitivity , @xmath18 should be set to the smallest velocity one aims to be sensitive for , while for discovery experiments it is sufficient to choose @xmath18 as roughly the maximum dark matter velocity in order to infer the expected distribution width .",
