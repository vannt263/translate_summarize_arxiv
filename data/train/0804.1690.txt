    "often in genetic applications , and in special in immune - genetics , interest lies in detecting and quantifying the association of a given genomic region to a trait . here",
    "the genomic region might be a gene or a gene - complex . typically , no bio - molecular or genomic information is directly available about this genomic region , but instead , a system of dna - markers located close to the region is used .",
    "an example of this situation is the study presented by schou _",
    "et al _ , ( 2007 , 2008 ) where the possible association of the susceptibility to several parasites and the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) in chickens was investigated using the microsatellite lei0258 as a marker .",
    "another example involves the use of a tight system of snp markers to associate putative alleles in the mhc region and susceptibility to psoriasis in humans ( orru _ et al _ , 2002 ) .",
    "the association between alleles or haplotypes in the genomic region of interest and the trait is commonly characterized by a regression - like statistical model in which the trait enters as the dependent variable and factors representing the presence of the marker - alleles are included among the explanatory variables .",
    "a common practice is to declare association between the trait and the genomic region when at least one of the parameters representing the marker - alleles is statistically significant .    in order to establish association between traits and putative haplotypes in the genomic region of interest",
    "it is required to use a representation of those haplotypes in terms of marker - alleles ( the only genomic information available ) .",
    "this representation is crucial to properly characterize the association .",
    "we argue that such a representation should be constructed with groups of marker - alleles instead of only individual marker alleles .",
    "informally , our main point is that when considering only groups consisted of single marker - alleles ( as usually done when using a naive approach ) one might fail to represent alleles or haplotypes in the neighbouring genomic region .",
    "this leads to a significant reduction of efficiency or even to the complete loss of the capacity to detect certain associations .",
    "our approach requires the use of a more complex statistical inference involving a search in a large number of possibilities .",
    "we show however , that the statistical inference is feasible for a moderate number of marker - alleles ( 10 - 15 allele - markers ) .",
    "the text is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section.2 ] contains the basic setup , including a description of the genetic and molecular biological scenario , a formulation of the statistical model in terms of a generalized linear model and some discussion on the proper form of performing inference under those premises . a phylogenetic based argument justifying our proposal",
    "is presented in the last part of section [ section.2 ] .",
    "the details of the implementation of the statistical inference are given in section [ section.3 ] and one examples is discussed in section [ section.4 ] .",
    "some discussion is provided in section [ section.5 ] .",
    "we assume that the data available consist of observations on @xmath0 diploid individuals from a given population for which we have the information on the values of a trait and a range of explanatory variables characterizing the individuals .",
    "the interest is in detecting and characterizing a possible association between the trait of interest and alleles or haplotypes in a given genomic region such as a gene or a gene complex which are not directly observable .",
    "we will refer to these alleles or haplotypes as the _ haplotypes in the genomic region of interest_.    we assume additionally that data on dna markers located close to the genomic region is available .",
    "these markers are assumed to be tight linked so that they can be viewed as a single locus with several possible alleles ( _ e.g_. a microsatellite marker or a system of very close snp markers ) , called the _ marker - alleles_.    the data available can be thought as composed of @xmath0 triplets , @xmath1 where @xmath2 indexes the @xmath0 individuals , @xmath3 is the value of the trait , @xmath4 is a vector of auxiliar explanatory variables and @xmath5 is a vector representing the values of @xmath6 allele - markers observed for the @xmath7 individual .",
    "we introduce below a suitable generalized linear model ( glim ) that will serve as a framework to expose our method .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the techniques presented to other regression - like statistical models .",
    "the generalized linear model describing the data is specified by choosing a distribution for the trait among the family of the exponential dispersion models ( jrgensen _ et al _ , 1996 ) ( typically , but not necessarily , a normal distribution ) and specifying a relationship between the expected value of the trait and the explanatory variables ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "here we assume that there is a smooth monotone function @xmath10 , called the _ link function _ , and the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that @xmath13   \\ , = \\ , { \\mbox{{\\bf x}}}_i { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\beta$}}}+ \\alpha_1 i_{m_{1i}}+ \\dots + \\alpha_h i_{m_{hi } } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the @xmath7 individual carries the @xmath15 marker - allele and 0 otherwise .",
    "we assume , for simplicity , that all the alleles act as completely dominant .",
    "that is , the effect of an allele in homozygous individuals carrying two copies of the allele is equal to the effect of the allele in heterozygous individuals carrying one copy of the allele .",
    "this assumption can easily be modified to include other genetic mechanisms by modifying the definition of the factors representing the marker - alleles ( _ eg _ by defining factors with more than two levels for representing partial dominance ) .    using standard techniques of generalized linear models",
    "it is possible to make inference on the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "here our interest lies in the parameter @xmath16 representing the effects of the marker - alleles , while @xmath17 is considered as an auxiliary nuisance parameter .",
    "the association between the genomic region of interest and the trait is often verified by considering a test of hypothesis given by @xmath18 since @xmath19 represents a vector with all components equal to zero , the null hypothesis @xmath20 above is saying that all the components of the vector @xmath16 are equal to zero while the alternative hypothesis @xmath21 states that _ at least one _ of the marker alleles has a non - vanishing effect .",
    "this test can be easily carried out by comparing a model defined by ( [ eq.1 ] ) to a model defined by @xmath22   \\ , = \\ , { \\mbox{{\\bf x}}}_i { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\beta$}}}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using a likelihood ratio type test .",
    "rejection of the null hypothesis indicates association of the genomic region in study to the trait of interest .",
    "although this simple joint test detects association , it does not help to identify the associated haplotypes in the genomic region of interest .",
    "a naive procedure is to identify alleles or haplotypes in the genomic region by looking for the marker - alleles with statistically significant effects .",
    "we claim that this can be misleading .",
    "it might happen that some of the alleles or haplotypes in the genomic region are in close linkage disequilibrium ( _ i.e. _ are tight linked to ) with more than one marker - allele in such a a way that in some individuals the first marker - allele occur while the second do not occur ( and vice - verse ) . a phylogenetic - based argument presented below shows that this scenario can and indeed often occurs .",
    "under this situation , the tests for the effect of each single factor representing each of the marker - alleles would not have biological meaning and would imply in a loss of power due to a misclassification of individuals .",
    "therefore , the inference on haplotypes in the genomic region of interest should be performed using sets of marker - alleles instead of only individual marker - alleles .    the precise formal statement of this idea",
    "is given below .",
    "let @xmath23 be pairwise disjoint non - empty subsets of the set of marker alleles @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 ) .",
    "define the model given by @xmath26   \\ , = \\ , { \\mbox{{\\bf x}}}_i { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\beta$}}}+ \\alpha_1 i_{g_{1i}}+ \\dots + \\alpha_h i_{g_{hi } } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a variable taking value 1 if the @xmath7 individual carries at least one allele - marker belonging to the subset @xmath28 ( for @xmath29 ) .",
    "clearly , the simple model given by ( [ eq.1 ] ) is contained in the class of models in the form given by ( [ eq.3 ] ) , since the disjoint subsets @xmath23 can be all constituted of a single element .",
    "however , this class of models contains many other models ( any possible combination of non - empty disjoint subsets of @xmath30 ) , which opens the possibility of finding a model of this type that suitably describes the genetic phenomena in play .",
    "we discuss in section [ section.3 ] a strategy for searching for the best representation among the many possibilities .",
    "a number of special structures naturally appear during the evolution process of a population . as a consequence ,",
    "the information that dna - markers carry on neighbour loci is distributed according to some characteristic patterns . in this section",
    "we illustrate this general claim using a simple phylogenetic - like construction based on dichotomous branching trees . we will show how some motifs of association involving markers and alleles in the genomic region occur naturally .",
    "this will then be used to argue in favor of using a proper representation of the effect of dna - markers and to base the inference using statistical models defined with groups of marker - alleles as in ( [ eq.3 ] ) .",
    "consider a locus @xmath31 in the genomic region of interest and two observable markers @xmath32 and @xmath33 in a neighbourhood of @xmath31 .",
    "suppose , for exposition simplicity that @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are di - allelic with pairs of alleles @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . assume , moreover , that recombination between these loci can be neglected due to a strong linkage disequilibrium around the region of interest .",
    "we can think of each of those alleles as the result of a single event occurred at some point in the evolutionary history of the population in play ( _ e.g. _ a single nucleotide mutation or the duplication of a small genomic region ) .",
    "the sequence of events that generated these alleles can be represented by a tree with three dichotomous branching , each branching corresponding to the event that generated one of the alleles .",
    "we use the convention that the alleles represented by capital letters are the results of events , while the alleles represented by small letters are the reference alleles , or wild types , corresponding to the states of the loci before the events .    a marker - allele @xmath37 _ carries information _ about the locus @xmath31 when the knowledge of the occurrence of @xmath37 determines the allelic form of @xmath31 .",
    "if the allele @xmath37 can occur together with the allele @xmath38 and the allele @xmath39 , then @xmath37 is said to be _",
    "neutral _ with respect to the locus @xmath31 .",
    "for instance , if the branching that formed the locus @xmath31 occurred before the branching of the locus @xmath32 and the branching of @xmath32 occurred in the branch of the tree containing the allele @xmath38 ( see figure 1a ) , then the occurrence of the allele @xmath37 in the locus @xmath32 implies that the locus @xmath31 carries the allele @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , in that circumstances the occurrence of the allele @xmath40 does not imply neither that @xmath31 carries the allele @xmath38 nor @xmath39 .",
    "therefore the allele @xmath37 carries information on the locus @xmath31 and the allele @xmath40 is neutral with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "figure 2a illustrates a scenario where the branching of the locus @xmath31 occurred first , which was followed by the branching of the locus @xmath32 and then the branching of the locus @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , the branching of the locus @xmath32 occurred in the branch of the tree containing the allele @xmath38 while the branching of the locus @xmath33 occurred in the branch of the tree containing the marker - allele @xmath40 . under these circumstances",
    "there are only four possible haplotypes : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the allele @xmath37 only occurs together with the allele @xmath38 , and it carries information about the locus @xmath31 .",
    "analogously , the allele @xmath45 carries also information on the locus @xmath31 . since the alleles @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath46 might occur together with both the allele @xmath38 and the allele @xmath39 , then both @xmath40 and @xmath46 are neutral with respect to the locus @xmath31 .",
    "we can still draw further conclusions about the distribution of the information on the locus @xmath31 .",
    "if we want to use a rule for detecting the presence of the allele @xmath38 based on of the occurrence of marker - alleles , then the rule @xmath38 occurs when @xmath37 or @xmath45 occurs would detect two out of the three occurrences of the allele @xmath38 . a rule based only on the occurrence of the marker - allele @xmath37 would only detect one out of the three possible occurrences of the allele @xmath38 and therefore would be less efficient in detecting @xmath38 than the rule using the alleles @xmath37 and @xmath45 together .",
    "the alleles @xmath40 and @xmath46 are both neutral and therefore the occurrence of the allele @xmath38 in the haplotype @xmath43 can not be detected using the information contained in the marker - alleles .",
    "we conclude that under the scenario described by figure 2a , one can only detect the occurrence of the allele @xmath38 using a rule based on the marker - alleles in two out of the three possible haplotypes containing @xmath38 .",
    "this maximum possible information recovery is attained only by the rule @xmath38 occurs when @xmath37 or @xmath45 occurs.    a different scenario is described in figure 2b where the branching in the locus @xmath32 occurred first , followed by the branching in the locus @xmath31 , in the branch containing the allele @xmath37 , and then the branching in the locus @xmath33 in the branch of @xmath31 containing the allele @xmath38 . in this case",
    "the four possible haplotypes are : @xmath47 , @xmath41 , @xmath48 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the marker - allele @xmath45 carries information on @xmath31 and the marker - allele @xmath37 is neutral .",
    "the alleles @xmath40 and @xmath46 necessarily occur together and both carry information on @xmath31 ( but the same information ) .",
    "here there are two cases in which the genotype of the locus @xmath31 is determined by the genotypes of the marker - alleles : occurrence of @xmath45 and occurrence of @xmath40 and @xmath46 implying the occurrence of @xmath38 or @xmath39 respectively .",
    "note that the last event occurrence of @xmath40 and @xmath46 is equivalent to the event not occurrence of @xmath37 or @xmath45. under this scenario there are only two rules based on the marker - alleles genotypes that determine the genotype at the locus @xmath31 , both can be expressed as the effect of a combination of the occurrence of the marker - alleles @xmath37 and @xmath45 . the first rule ( occurrence of @xmath45 implies occurrence of @xmath38 )",
    "can also be expressed as the effect of a single allele - marker as in the traditional inference method , but the second rule ( not occurrence of @xmath37 or @xmath45 implies the occurrence of @xmath39 ) requires the use of groups of marker - alleles as in the models described in ( [ eq.3 ] ) to be properly represented in a statistical model .",
    "here sticking only to rules based on single markers would represent a loss of half of the possibilities for determining the allele at the locus @xmath31 , that is a loss of half of the information on the genotype of the locus @xmath31 that could be recovered with the knowledge of the marker - alleles .",
    "figure 3 displays the branching tree of a more complex scenario composed with the locus @xmath31 in the genomic region of interest and four marker - loci @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , with alleles @xmath37 , @xmath40 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively ( we apply the same notational convention as before ) .",
    "the following six haplotypes are formed : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the rule if @xmath37 or @xmath45 or @xmath51 or @xmath53 occur then @xmath38 occurs detects four out of the five haplotypes containing the allele @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , under the current scenario , this is the best possible rule that could be constructed with the information on the marker - alleles that we have at hand .",
    "although the allele @xmath51 carries information on the locus @xmath31 , this information is redundant since @xmath51 occurs always together with @xmath45 .",
    "we can then remove the occurrence of the allele @xmath51 from the rule and still detect the same cases where the allele @xmath38 occurs when using the rule including the marker - alleles of the four marker loci .",
    "the discussion above shows that in several situations the use of a naive representation of the effects of the marker - alleles is inefficient and that fully efficiency is obtained when using the approach involving the representation of groups of allele - markers .",
    "this phenomenon is not restricted to the few scenarios presented here .",
    "we claim , without giving a formal proof , that every time that there is a branching after the branching that generated the allele in the locus @xmath31 the new marker - allele formed will carry information on the locus @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , if the branching occurs in the branch that contains the wild type allele of the last branching of a marker locus , then the new marker allele formed will add new information on the locus @xmath31 that is not contained in the marker - alleles formed before .",
    "this progressive gain of information obtained while the new marker - alleles are being formed is only fully realized if we use a rule of the type if @xmath37 or @xmath45 or @xmath51 or ... occurs , then @xmath38 occurs.     in the genomic region of interest with the alleles @xmath38 ( variant allele ) and @xmath39 ( wild type allele ) and one marker loci @xmath32 with alleles @xmath37 and @xmath40 .",

    "the strategy we propose for characterizing the association between a genomic region and a trait consists in searching exhaustively all the possible groupings formed with sets of marker - alleles and then choose the best candidate among the many possibilities . here",
    "the best candidate is one that represents all the haplotypes of the genomic region of interest that are associated with the trait and that is not redundant .",
    "we define a _ grouping of the marker - alleles _ as a collection of non - empty disjoint subsets of the set of all marker - alleles .",
    "the subsets of a grouping are called _ marker - alleles groups _ ( mag ) .",
    "the idea is to use mags to represent haplotypes in the genomic region of interest that might be associated with the trait . for each possible",
    "grouping of the marker - alleles one statistical model of the type described by ( [ eq.3 ] ) containing factors representing each mag of this grouping is fit .",
    "the grouping that generates the model with the best fit , according to a criterion to be defined below , is chosen to represent the association between the genomic region of interest and the trait .",
    "the grouping will be chosen in such a way that it will not contain redundancy , so each mag will represent one haplotype in the region of interest",
    ". the number of mags in this grouping will be the number of detectable haplotypes associated with the trait .",
    "the magnitude of the effect of each mag will be then the component of the magnitude of the haplotype that is detectable through the marker - alleles ( which is smaller or equal to the magnitude of the effect of the unknown haplotype ) .",
    "this procedure is only feasible if the number of marker - alleles is not very large ( we were able to analyse a data with 9 allele markers in few minutes in an ordinary personal computer ) .",
    "it is convenient to make the exhaustive enumeration of all possible groupings of the marker - alleles in the following way .",
    "consider the class @xmath61 of all subsets of the set of marker - alleles @xmath62 .",
    "formally , @xmath61 is the class of parts of @xmath30 .",
    "we associate one statistical model to each element @xmath52 of @xmath61 by defining the model of the type defined by ( [ eq.3 ] ) that incorporate factors representing the groups of marker - alleles present in @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath63 let @xmath64 be the class of all the subsets of @xmath30 containing exactly @xmath65 disjoint non - empty sub - sets .",
    "clearly @xmath61 is the disjoint union @xmath66 therefore we can search for the best models by proceeding in two steps : first we find the best model for each @xmath64 ( @xmath67 ) and then we find the best model among the candidates found in the first step .",
    "the selection of the best model related to a given @xmath64 ( @xmath67 ) is done by choosing the model with the largest value of the likelihood ( or equivalently the log - likelihood ) function . in this way",
    "the set of values of the likelihoods of the chosen candidate for each @xmath64 is a profile set and plays a rule analogous to the rule of a profile likelihood curve for the number of marker - alleles .",
    "denote the model that attains the maximum of the likelihood for a given @xmath64 by @xmath68 and the value log - likelihood function of @xmath68 at the maximum by @xmath69 ( for @xmath70 ) .",
    "we refer to these quantities as the _ profile model _ and the _ profile log - likelihood _ of order @xmath65 .",
    "the next step in the procedure of inference is to choose the class @xmath64 ( @xmath71 ) that yields the best statistical model .",
    "if we assume that the haplotypes in the genomic region of interest are representable in terms of subsets of @xmath30 , then choosing the class @xmath64 that produces the best statistical model is equivalent to infer the number of detectable haplotypes in the genomic region of interest .",
    "the profile log - likelihood never decreases when the number of haplotypes assumed in the model increase , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath72 since a model @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) can be expressed as a sub - model of a model with @xmath75 mags in which a pair of mags present the same effect . as a consequence , it is not reasonable to estimate the number of haplotypes in the region of interest by choosing the @xmath64 with larger log - likelihood .",
    "we argue next that maximizing the negative akaike information ( or a variant of it ) is a reasonable procedure for inferring the number of haplotypes in the genomic region of interest .",
    "the inequality ( [ eq.5 ] ) does not extract all the information available on the development of the profile likelihood curve as the number of putative haplotypes of the genomic region of interest increases .",
    "indeed , the profile log - likelihood curve is expected to increase significantly with the number of putative haplotypes until the number of detectable haplotypes is reached .",
    "after that point the profile log - likelihood curve is supposed to remain approximately constant . to see that ,",
    "consider the situation where there are @xmath76 associated haplotypes in the genomic region .",
    "if @xmath77 , then the model @xmath68 fails to represent at least one haplotype and then the profile log - likelihood should increase in a statistically significant way with the addition of the possibility to represent one more haplotype . once attained the number of haplotypes the gain obtained by increasing the capacity of the model to represent one more haplotype vanishes and only marginal gains in the profile log - likelihood are expected ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "we assume implicitly here that there are no significant mixtures in the data and that the model is not missing any important explanatory variable ( see figure 4 ) the informal argument above suggests we can infer the number of detectable haplotypes in the genomic region by searching for the point at which the profile log - likelihood curve remains ( approximately ) constant .",
    "one way to do that is to subtract a suitable quantity from the profile log - likelihood . by doing that , the new adjusted profile log - likelihood would decrease approximately linearly in the region where the original profile log - likelihood was constant ( _ i.e. _ when the assumed number of haplotypes is larger than the number of detectable haplotypes in the genomic region of interest ) .",
    "if the subtracted quantity is not too large , the adjusted profile log - likelihood curve will still increase in the region where the original profile log - likelihood is increasing significantly ( before attaining the number of detectable haplotypes ) .",
    "the so called akaike information criterion ( akaike , 1974 , burnham and anderson , 2002 ) explores this idea and is equivalent to subtract the number of parameters in the model from the log - likelihood .",
    "in fact the akaike information @xmath78 is defined as minus twice the difference of the log - likelihood and the number of parameters , more precisely , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number of parameters in the statistical model , and @xmath81 is the maximized value of the likelihood function for the estimated model . minimizing the akaike information is equivalent to maximizing the log - likelihood adjusted by subtracting the number of parameters in the model .",
    "this apparently arbitrary choice for the quantity subtracted from the log - likelihood can be justified as being equivalent to subtract from a likelihood ratio statistic its ( asymptotic ) expected value .",
    "alternatively , one might subtract @xmath82 from the profile log - likelihood which would be equivalent to perform a likelihood ratio test for incorporating the representation of an additional haplotype to the current model when working at a significance level of 5% .",
    "summing up , the procedure we propose is to maximize the log - likelihood in each class @xmath83 ( which is equivalent to minimize the aic in this class of models since all the models in @xmath83 has by construction the same number of parameters ) , for @xmath84 , and then choose the model with the smaller ( profile ) aic ( or equivalently , with the larger adjusted profile log - likelihood ) .",
    "the association between the susceptibility to the helminth _ ascaridia galli _ in chickens and the major histocompatibility ( gene ) complex ( mhc ) was investigated in two recent studies ( schou _ et al _ , 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "these studies used the microsatellite lei0258 ( fulton et al . , 2006 ) , which is located in a non - coding region between two contiguous regions of the mhc gene complex ( the b - f / b - l and the bg loci ) , to obtain eight polymorphic marker - alleles here denoted 195bp , 207bp , 219bp , 251bp , 264bp , 276bp , 297bp and 324bp . since recombination within the chicken mhc is very rare ( plachy et al .",
    ", 1992 ; miller et al . , 2004 ) , the alleles of the microsatellite lei0258 are expected to be in tight linkage disequilibrium with haplotypes formed by alleles at the bf / bl and the bg loci ( _ i.e. _ the mhc haplotypes ) .",
    "moreover , we can discard the possibility of a direct effect of the lei0258 alleles since this marker is located in a non - coding region ( as any microsatellite marker ) .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to apply the techniques described above using the alleles of the microsatellite lei0258 as marker - alleles in the set - up described above .    in the first study ( schou _ et al _ , 2007 ) the intensity of infection with _",
    "a. galli _ was determined for birds of two chicken breeds by counting the number of this worms found in the intestine of each of the birds examined .",
    "the counts were categorized as , zero , low ( up to 3 counts ) , intermediate ( 4 to 10 counts ) and high ( more than 10 counts ) .",
    "the cut - off points used for defining the categories above were chosen in such a way that the losses of the klback - leiber information about the counts due to a discretization were minimized .",
    "the association between the intensity of infection and the mhc haplotypes was studied by applying a baseline - category logits model for multinomial distributed data ( agresti , 1990 ) using the zero - category as a reference .",
    "inference in these models can be performed by fitting three logistic models constructed with a common reference category ( agresti , 1990 ) which can be done by using standard generalized linear models ( with a binomial distribution and a logistic link ) .",
    "the standard method was used in this study and an association was declared if the effect of a marker - allele , in the presence of the other marker - alleles , was statistically significant . using this procedure",
    "it was found that the occurrence of the marker - allele 276bp was associated with an increased resistance .",
    "no further associations were found with the standard procedure .",
    "a second study ( schou _ et al _ , 2008 ) was independently performed with different birds of the same two chicken breeds . in this",

    "a baseline - category logits model was applied but , differently from the first study , using the strategy of searching for marker - allele groups ( mag ) .",
    "three marker - allele groups , denoted mag-1 , mag-2 and mag-3 , were identified and found to be associated with the intensity of infection with _ a. galli_. figure [ figura.4 ] displays the profile log - likelihood and profile akaike information as a function of the number of mags assumed to be associated to the infection level .",
    "a joint likelihood ratio test indicated a statistically significant effect of these three mags on the intensity of infection ( p=0.0013 ) .",
    "mag-1 was formed by the lei0258 alleles 297bp and 324bp ; mag-2 was composed of the alleles 195bp , 207bp , 219bp and 264bp ; and mag-3 only contained the allele 276bp .",

    "note that when applying the standard strategy only the effect of the marker - allele 276bp was found significant , which is equivalent of detecting the marker - allele group mag-3 ( composed only by the allele 276bp ) .",
    "none of the marker - alleles composing the marker - allele group mag-1 and mag-2 ( _ i.e. _ 297bp , 324bp , 195bp , 207bp , 219bp and 264bp ) presented an individual significant effect , which illustrates the loss of power to detect association when applying the standard modelling strategy .     for each successive increase in the number of marker - allele groups ,",

    "the value 10 was added all the values of the negative alternative profile akaike information for graphical convenience . the negative profile akaike information and the alternative negative profile akaike information presented both a maximum at 3 suggesting the presence of 3 detectable marker - allele groups .",

    "we presented a strategy for performing statistical inference that allows to represent the occurrence of non - observable alleles or haplotypes in a genomic region of interest in terms of a range of observable marker - alleles at highly linked loci .",
    "the kernel idea presented here is that the natural unit to build statistical models under this context are not the marker - alleles but groups of marker - alleles . as argued due to the way haplotypes in a genomic region of relatively small size ( such that allow us to ignore recombination )",
    "are formed during the evolution of a population , certain haplotypes formed with marker - alleles will occur naturally in tight linkage disequilibrium with ( non - observable ) haplotypes in the genomic region . the way these marker - allele haplotypes",
    "are constituted imply that detection rules based on indication functions of groups of marker - alleles are optimal in the sense that they allow to extract the maximum possible amount of information that is contained in the marker - alleles .",
    "naive representations constructed exclusively with groups of allele - markers with only one element are bounded to use inefficiently the information ( if not destroy it completely ) , as illustrated in an example with real data .",
    "the techniques presented here involve fitting many models and selecting a best candidate among the ( very ) many possibilities , following a sequence of models with increasing number of assumed marker - allele groups .",
    "this order is tough to facilitate the inference of the number of marker - allele groups with _",
    "detectable _ effect on the trait of interest . however , this _ force brut _ exhaustive search is not feasible for a large number of marker - alleles , since the number of possibilities to be checked increases very rapidly with the number of marker - alleles . an alternative is to use monte carlo based algorithms for maximization in discrete parameter space as simulated annealing or the genetic algorithm .",
    "we showed that the classical criterion of maximizing the log - likelihood can not be used to estimate the number of detectable marker - alleles groups , since the likelihood function can not decrease with the number of mags .",
    "a way around that is to use the akaike information criterion which penalizes the log - likelihood of models with too many ( unnecessary ) parameters .",
    "other forms of penalized likelihood could be applied , as for instance the alternative information criterion proposed in the text , which is equivalent to perform a likelihood ratio test for incorporating one extra mag in the model ( at a 5% level of significance ) . the choice of the penalized likelihood method to be used depend on the type of basic statistical model used .",
    "we used generalized linear models to explain our ideas , but we stress that other models could had been used without essentially changing the procedure exposed here .",
    "indeed , the example presented uses in fact a slight extension of generalized linear models .",
    "probably one of the most relevant extensions would be the incorporation of random components allowing to represent population structure , co - ancestry and polygenic effects . another possibility to be explored is the incorporation of information on ancestors genotypes and other mechanisms of inheritance . in conclusion ,",
    "the techniques presented here are flexible and relatively easy to implement using classical statistical models and standard software .",
