    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are thought to result from the explosion of mass - accreting white dwarfs ( wd ) .",
    "since sne  ia are bright , they can be used to determine distances if their absolute brightness can be calibrated .",
    "the fact that all sne  ia seemed to show similar light curves and spectra encouraged their use as standard candles .",
    "in addition , sne  ia are important for galaxy chemical evolution since they provide most of the fe in the universe .    with the accumulation of new and more accurate data , the paradigm that sne  ia are all similar has been questioned . in particular , the discovery of objects such as the very bright sn  1991 t ( filippenko et al .",
    "1992a ; phillips et al .",
    "1992 ; ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "1992 ) and the very faint sn  1991bg ( filippenko et al . 1992b ; leibundgut et al .",
    "1993 ; turatto et al .",
    "1997 ) showed that sne  ia exist with very different properties from those of the classical objects defining this class , e.g. sne 1981b ( branch et al .",
    "1983 ) or 1992a ( kirshner et al . 1993 ) .",
    "other peculiar sne  ia , both over- and under - luminous , have subsequently been discovered , showing that such events , although less frequent than ` normal ' sne  ia , are certainly not just rare exceptions .",
    "the progenitor masses and the explosion mechanisms leading to these peculiar sne  ia are currently topics of debate , but it is clear that the over - luminous objects produce more @xmath1ni than ` normal ' sne  ia , while the under - luminous ones produce less ( mazzali et al . 1993 , 1995 , 1997 ) .    objects such as sne  1991bg and 1991 t are not only different in luminosity from the average sn  ia , but their spectra are also different , at least at phases before and around maximum ( however , phillips et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have shown that sn  1991 t 14 days after maximum was indistinguishable from other sne  ia ) , reflecting differences in temperature and also in the composition of the outer layers .",
    "it has been argued that by selecting sne ia on the basis of a normal spectrum at about maximum or earlier , one can define a subgroup of ` normal ' sne  ia which can be used as standard candles ( branch & miller 1993 ; vaughan et al .",
    "1995 ; saha et al .",
    "the vast majority of well - observed sne  ia belong to this group , and so peculiar objects such as sne  1991bg and 1991 t can be safely removed from the sample .",
    "therefore , if the ` spectroscopically normal ' sne  ia are to be used as standard candles , all of their properties should be similar . however , observational evidence has been accumulating for the existence of a relation between the absolute magnitude at maximum of sne  ia ( normal and peculiar ) and the rate at which their light curves decline after maximum .",
    "this is known as the phillips or @xmath3 relation , which indicates that the sne whose rate of decline is slower are those that reach a brighter absolute magnitude ( phillips 1993 ) . indeed , the hubble diagram for a sample of distant sne  ia has a much smaller dispersion when the @xmath3 effect is corrected for ( hamuy et al .",
    "1996b ) .",
    "model light curves have shown that the origin of the @xmath4 relation could lie in the existence of a range in the ni mass and distribution produced in the explosion ( hflich et al .",
    "1996 ; cappellaro et al .",
    "the amount of ni produced is directly related to the energy of the explosion and is reflected in the kinetic energy of the ejecta .",
    "thus we address the question : can any direct observational evidence for this scenario be found ?",
    "we have analyzed the photometric and spectroscopic data on sne  ia collected at eso over the last several years .",
    "we concentrated on spectra obtained at epochs of about one year after maximum . at",
    "epochs greater then 100 - 150 d , sne  ia display a nebular spectrum : the ejecta have become so thin that they are transparent to radiation .",
    "the gas is heated by the deposition of some of the energy carried by the @xmath5-rays and the positrons produced by the decay of @xmath1co ( the daughter nucleus of @xmath1ni ) into stable @xmath1fe , while cooling takes place via forbidden line emission .",
    "forbidden lines of fe  ii and fe  iii dominate the spectrum , confirming that iron - group elements are prevalent in the inner part of the ejecta . the outer layers , where lighter elements are distributed , have too small a column density to absorb the surviving @xmath5-rays ( the positrons , which actually dominate the energy input after about 200 days , deposit essentially in situ ) and thus do not contribute significantly to the spectrum .    a representative sample of sne ia spectra at an epoch of about 1 year taken from the eso+asiago sn archive is shown in fig.1 .",
    "although the spectra shown in fig.1 belong to sne that differ by up to 3 magnitudes in brightness at maximum ( from sn  1991bg to sn  1991 t ) , it is interesting to note that their nebular spectra are quite similar , except for the line widths . in particular , the two strongest lines in the blue have similar ratios , when reddening has been corrected for .",
    "since the bluer feature ( 4700 ) is almost exclusively due to fe  iii forbidden lines , while the red feature ( 5300 ) is formed by a blend of fe  ii and fe  iii forbidden lines , their ratio is sensitive to the ionization / excitation conditions ( and hence temperature and density in the nebula ) .",
    "preliminary modelling work on the nebular spectra ( mazzali et al .",
    "1998 , in prep . )",
    "indicates that the observed range of a factor 1.5 in the line ratio can be obtained for a difference in temperature and ionization of not more than 10% .",
    "this must imply that the energy deposition rate per unit volume in the sn nebula is quite similar in all sne .",
    "indeed cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that the difference in brightness at maximum is preserved , or even increased at the later epochs .",
    "since our sample includes objects from the least luminous sn  ia known to date , sn  1991bg , to the most luminous one ,",
    "sn  1991 t , the entire range of sne  ia appears to share these same properties .",
    "the composition of the emitting nebula appears to be similar in all sne : all spectra are dominated by lines of fe and co , although the mass of these elements produced is probably very different in the various objects , ranging from about 0.1 m@xmath6 in sn  1991bg ( mazzali et al .",
    "1997 ) to approximately 0.6 m@xmath6 in ` normal ' sne  ia and about 1 m@xmath6 in sn  1991 t ( spyromilio et al . 1993 ) .",
    "this confirms that only the inner fe sphere is significantly affected by the heat input following the absorption of the @xmath5-rays and the positrons , essentially a local process , and that mixing is not significant , at least at the lowest velocities .",
    "the second distinguishing property of the nebular spectra of fig.1 is that the lines have different widths in different sne .",
    "the line widths span about a factor of 5 : the faint sn  1991bg has the narrowest lines , and the bright sn  1991 t has the broadest lines .    if the physical conditions ( temperature , density ) in the nebulae are similar , as indicated by the line ratios , and if the brighter sne produce more @xmath1ni , it should be expected that the more massive ni sphere in the brighter and more energetic sne is larger than in the fainter sne .",
    "since the expansion of the ejecta is homologous ( i.e. @xmath7 ) , a correlation between the width of the nebular lines and the brightness of the sn should be expected .    excluding the case of sn  1991bg , where several individual lines are resolved , in all other cases the observed lines are the result of very strong blending . in particular , the features in the range 4500 - 5500  can be fitted with three gaussians to measure position , intensity and fwhm ( the continuum being set to zero ) .",
    "the fwhm of the strongest feature , measured at @xmath8 , was then selected as the reference value , because it is always narrower than that at @xmath9   and has a much better s / n than the much weaker feature at @xmath10 .",
    "the value of fwhm is representative of the ejecta velocity , but a knowledge of the density / velocity distribution would be needed to translate it into a kinetic energy .",
    "in addition , when blending is severe , the value of fwhm is an overestimate of the velocity of the fe nebula .",
    "the effect of line blending can be estimated using synthetic spectra ( mazzali et al .",
    "1998 , in prep . ) . by comparing the velocity used in the model for the fe - nebula with the fwhm of the @xmath8  feature measured on the model synthetic spectra we found that blending can be neglected only for input velocities of up to 3000 km / s .",
    "the relation between input velocity and measured fwhm has a discontinuity when blending sets in , between about 3000 and 6000 km / s , but for higher velocities a monotonic relation is recovered .",
    "the velocity of the model fe - nebula is marked in the upper x - axis of fig .",
    "2 .    the measured fwhm should be plotted against the sn absolute magnitude .",
    "unfortunately , the absolute magnitude is a very uncertain quantity , since it depends on the adopted distance scale and extinction correction . to avoid these problems , we make use of the relation between the absolute magnitude at maximum and @xmath0 , the difference in @xmath11 magnitude between the time of maximum and 15 days later ( phillips 1993 , hamuy et al .",
    "this latter quantity can be measured directly , so that two observables can be compared .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 are readily available in the literature for most of the objects in our sample . for sne 1994ae and 1995d , we measured @xmath0 on the light curves published by riess et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , whereas for sne 1991 m and 1993l we used unpublished eso photometry , which unfortunately does not cover the time of maximum very well .",
    "we also note that the light curve of sn  1989 m is very poorly sampled .    a plot of fwhm(4700 )",
    "v. @xmath0 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is apparent that a correlation exists between the two quantities ( the spearman rank - order correlation coefficent is @xmath12 ) .",
    "note also that a significant spread in both line width and decline time is present even among ` normal ' sne  ia .",
    "even when the extreme case of sne 1991bg is removed from the sample , the null hypothesis of no correlation between @xmath0 and fwhm(4700 ) has a probability of only 0.003 .",
    "furthermore , the fwhm measured for sn  1991bg is lower than for other sne both because of the intrinsically low velocity and the absence of blending .",
    "our results establish a connection between the luminosity of the sne and their kinetic energy . since the maximum luminosity of a sn  ia depends essentially on the mass of @xmath1ni produced ,",
    "the observed difference in line width and strength in the late - time spectra is a strong indication that sne  ia produce a range of ni masses . in the case of the peculiar sne",
    "ia , the properties at early times are sufficiently different that the spectra are affected , while for ` spectroscopically normal ' sne this is not the case , and the differences emerge only in the rate of decline and in the nebular line width .",
    "however , branch & van den bergh ( 1993 ) noted a sequence in the velocity of the si ii lines in sne  ia about 10 days after maximum .",
    "this relation to galaxy type may be a less quantitative manifestation of the same phenomenon we are witnessing at late time .",
    "also , nugent et al . (",
    "1995 ) suggested a ` spectroscopic sequence ' among sne  ia near maximum .",
    "all the sne in their sample are also included in ours , and the ordering of the objects by nebular line width is similar to what they suggest based on the value of @xmath13 .",
    "they also hypothesized that the sequence is the result of the different amounts of @xmath1ni produced by the various sne .",
    "we can assume that the line width defines the volume of the ni sphere , and that this translates directly into a ni mass .",
    "if we accept the estimate of the ni mass for sn 1991 t",
    "( @xmath14 m@xmath6 , spyromilio et al . 1993 ) , we can scale the other sne accordingly .",
    "we find then that sn 1986 g should have a ni mass of @xmath15 m@xmath6 ; objects such as sne 1981b and 1992a , which we could call ` faint normal ' , have @xmath16 m@xmath6 , while ` bright normal ' objects like sn  1990n and 1994d have @xmath17 m@xmath6 , and appear to be the only sne producing the ` canonical ' amount of @xmath1ni .",
    "these values are only rough estimates , and further modelling work is required to obtain more accurate results .",
    "note that ruiz - lapuente & lucy ( 1992 ) determined for sn  1986 g m(@xmath1ni@xmath18 m@xmath6 , but they used a larger reddening . finally , the very subluminous sn  1991bg appears to have a very small ni mass , of about 0.01 m@xmath6 .",
    "this is smaller than the published values ( mazzali et al .",
    "1997 ) , but note that in the case of sn  1991bg blending does not affect the line width , and that the ratio of the fluxes in the blue and the red feature is the smallest among all the sne in our sample , indicating a lower degree of ionization and therefore a smaller fractional abundance of the fe iii ion , which is responsible for the blue feature .",
    "the models for sn  1991bg ( mazzali et al .",
    "1997 ) indeed require a higher ni density than in other sne .",
    "this leads to a lower ionization degree , and the flux is emitted more in the red line near 5300 .",
    "models for the explosion of wd s leading to sne  ia which produce less than the canonical 0.6  m@xmath6 of @xmath1ni typically require progenitors less massive than the chandrasekhar limit of 1.4  m@xmath6 ( see e.g. livne & arnett 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "hflich et al .",
    "( 1995 ) presented chandrasekhar mass , pulsating delayed detonation models for sne  ia .",
    "they can vary the mass of @xmath1ni produced by varying the density at which the transition from deflagration to detonation occurs .",
    "models that synthesize less @xmath1ni produce more si - group elements , so that all models produce about the same kinetic energy .",
    "they claim this family of models can explain the observed differences among sne  ia light curves .",
    "our results prove that the kinetic energy is actually related to the @xmath1ni mass , so that burning to nse is necessary in all realistic explosion models .",
    "since the rapid decline of the faint sne  ia does not appear to be the result of a large kinetic energy in a chandrasekhar - mass explosion , it is then likely to be due to a small exploding mass .",
    "the fact that sn  1991bg was the result of the explosion of a sub - chandrasekhar wd has received support from several independent studies . if the range of @xmath1ni masses which we observe in the nebular spectra is indeed the result of a range of progenitor masses , our understanding of the physics and the nature of sne  ia would be revolutionized .",
    "formally , we can fit the data of fig.2 with a straight line . since errors affect both axes , we performed a weighted , linear least square fit ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) , which gives the line shown in fig.2 . however , the variance of the points around the line seems too large to be due only to the estimated errors ( the reduced @xmath19 , and even excluding sn  1991bg we get @xmath20 )    whereas a possible interpretation of the large variance of the points in fig.2 is that the relation @xmath0 vs @xmath21 is not linear , it is possible that we are seeing an indication of the existence of a ` second parameter ' determining the shape of the light curves ( or possibly of the velocities ) .",
    "a similar suggestion was recently made by hflich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the context of a discussion of the @xmath22 relation .",
    "as the same authors commented , however , the uncertainties in the distance moduli and in the extinction corrections , and hence in the calibration of the sn absolute magnitude , cast some doubts on the reality of their finding .",
    "the variables plotted in fig .  2 are free from such uncertainties , and therefore the result is particularly intriguing .",
    "this ` second parameter ' could be related to the mode of explosion , and possibly also to the difference in the masses of the progenitors through the ratio of the mass of synthesized @xmath1ni and the mass of the ejecta ( cappellaro et al .",
    "the existence of a ` second parameter ' might weaken the potential of using the decline rate as a means to determine sn luminosities .",
    "however , the nebular spectra may offer another possibility . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the absolute magnitude at maximum should be directly correlated to the mass of synthesized @xmath1ni , with an associated uncertainty depending on the explosion model .",
    "if the @xmath1ni mass can be obtained from the nebular spectra , we may be able to use the late - time spectra of sne  ia as distance indicators , thus avoiding the uncertainties introduced by the ` second parameter ' .",
    "if a relation can be established between the width of the nebular lines and the absolute magnitude at maximum , and once it is well calibrated with the acquisition of more data , the absolute magnitude of a sn , and hence its distance , could be determined straightforwardly from a line width measurement on a nebular spectrum at an epoch of about one year .",
    "precise timing of the spectra is not so important , since we do not expect and have not seen any significant systematic evolution of the line width while the sne are in their nebular phase .",
    "also , theoretical models can be used to derive the @xmath1ni mass ( ruiz - lapuente & lucy 1992 ) and hence the luminosity at maximum ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1997 ) . against this",
    "however is the fact that the sne at one year are at least 7 magnitudes fainter than at maximum light .    if sne  ia produce a continuous range of @xmath1ni masses and kinetic energies , it is also quite likely that the masses of the progenitors vary , thus favouring the sub - chandrasekhar scenario for a large number of sne  ia .",
    "even objects that have been regarded as normal because of their spectroscopic appearance may indeed be subluminous and submassive , although less so than the well known cases , which are only the extremes of a continuous distribution .",
