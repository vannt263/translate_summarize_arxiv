    "equilibrium structures of a rigid rod inside a phospholipid bilayer are simulated within the scmf theory@xcite .",
    "a phospholipid molecule is represented at a coarse - grained level within the three beads model@xcite which is found to describe adequately the mechanical properties of the phospholipid bilayer at equilibrium .",
    "the infinite rod lying parallel to the bilayer represents the excluded area for the lipids and water molecules , while the interactions between phospholipids in the bilayer are described through the mean fields .",
    "the results of scmf calculations are presented in figure [ results10 ] and figure [ results6 ] .",
    "the free energy differences are calculated per unit cylinder length and neglect end effects .",
    "this approximation of infinitely long cylinder is reasonable for cylinders in which the lateral surface area is much larger than the end - cap area .",
    "the interaction of lipids with the cylinder are described by a single parameter @xmath1 that is the energy of interaction of phospholipid tails t with the surface of the cylinder : @xmath2 implies only steric repulsion , while negative values reflect the attraction of t - beads to the surface of the cylinder .",
    "insertion of a completely hydrophilic cylinder , @xmath2 , into a bilayer is energetically unfavorable ( black lines in figure [ results10](a ) and figure [ results6](a ) ) .",
    "the energy penalty increases with the length of the cylinder .",
    "the hydrophilic cylinder compresses the bilayer at small penetrations and breaks it at distances about @xmath3 nm from the center .",
    "the insertion free energy increases monotonously with depth of penetration and reaches a plateau of height @xmath4 kt / nm . the rupture of the bilayer is similar to a first order transition in the bulk .",
    "two solutions , one corresponding to the compressed bilayer and another to the broken bilayer , can coexist at some distance , while for other distances one solution is stable and another is metastable .",
    "thus , the cylinder can follow the metastable branch with higher free energy of compressed and intact bilayer before abrupt rupture , accompanied with sudden drop of the free energy .",
    "another reason for the dispersion of the points at the plateau are the error of calculations .",
    "thus , it can be used to estimate the accuracy of the calculations ( @xmath5 kt / nm ) .",
    "the presence of a parallel hydrophobic stripe on a hydrophilic cylinder makes the penetration of the cylinder inside the bilayer more favorable .",
    "this stripe is described by its width or projected angle ( in degrees ) in figure [ results10 ] and figure [ results6 ] .",
    "we explore only the orientation with the stripe faced down to the bilayer , since this is the lowest energy orientation , but these calculations can also be used to estimate the energy of rotation of the cylinder in the bilayer .    for relatively narrow stripes ( with the projected angle in the range @xmath6 degrees ) phospholipid heads move",
    "apart from the cylinder to accommodate the insertion at low penetrations , which allows for the energetically favorable contact between the stripe and the hydrophobic core of the membrane , and leads to the wetting of the stripe .",
    "the contact line moves up the hydrophilic cylinder surface forming a rim and increases the contact with the bilayer core . at higher penetrations the cylinder compresses the bilayer , and , eventually , breaks the membrane .",
    "the breakage distance between the cylinder and the membrane centers decreases with an increasing width of the stripe from @xmath7 nm ( the stripe of @xmath8 degrees projected angle ) to @xmath9 nm ( @xmath10 degrees stripe ) and the free energy of penetration becomes lower .",
    "the equilibrium position of the cylinder within the bilayer ( yellow band in figure [ results10](c ) corresponding to the minimum of the energy in figure [ results10](a ) ) also shifts to the center of the bilayer with increasing width of the stripe .",
    "thus , the width of the stripe controls not only the hydrophobicity of the cylinder and the insertion energy into the bilayer , but also the equilibrium position with respect to the bilayer core ( figure [ results10](b ) ) .",
    "the mean field concentration profiles in figure [ results10](b ) and figure [ results10](c ) demonstrate that hydrophobic interactions of @xmath11 kt are high enough for the cylinder to partially adsorb phospholipids from the bilayer .",
    "the hydrophobic stripe is covered with the phospholipids even after the rupture of the bilayer . for larger widths of the hydrophobic stripe ( @xmath12 degrees ) ,",
    "the rupture of both leaflets of the bilayer does not occur and the cylinder is covered by phospholipids in the entire range of penetrations from @xmath13 to @xmath14 nm from the bilayer center .",
    "the bilayer only bends around the cylinder at small penetrations @xmath15 nm , and covers the whole hydrophobic part of its surface at larger penetrations @xmath16 nm .    the scmf method provides the probability of conformations of molecules in a given field .",
    "thus , it allows for visualization of the solutions of the mean field equations in the form of the most probable conformations of molecules in the mean fields that correspond to the solution of the equations@xcite .",
    "the example of most probable conformations of phospholipids which correspond to the equilibrium position of the amphiphilic cylinder in the bilayer is shown in figure [ snapshot ] .    at lower hydrophobicity ( @xmath17 kt , figure [ results6 ] ) ,",
    "the behavior of the system is different in many aspects .",
    "the compression of the bilayer for relatively small ( @xmath6 degrees ) widths of the hydrophobic stripe leads to the rupture of the membrane farther from the bilayer center than for the same stripes with higher hydrophobicity .",
    "similarly , the equilibrium position of the cylinder with the same stripes but lower hydrophobicity is shifted closer to the surface of the bilayer .",
    "the overall surface of narrow stripes is too small to allow for the contact with two edges of the broken layer .",
    "hydrophobic stripes of larger width and @xmath18 kt induce small perturbations to the structure of the bilayer due to rearrangements of lipids around the stripe at relatively small penetrations .",
    "phospholipid heads pushed apart by the inserted cylinder enable contact of the stripe with the hydrophobic core of the bilayer .",
    "penetration of the cylinder to @xmath19 nm from the bilayer center , induces the rupture of the bilayer into two parts .",
    "each part of the broken layer contacts with the stripe at their edges .",
    "the equilibrium position of the cylinders with large hydrophobic stripes ( @xmath12 degrees ) is in the center of the bilayer .",
    "however , the interaction energy @xmath18 is insufficient for phospholipids to cover the cylinder from all sides and the cylinder forms a pore in the bilayer ( the central cross - section concentration profiles in figure [ results6](b ) are different from the corresponding profiles in figure [ results10](b ) for @xmath12 degrees stripes ) .",
    "the main difference between @xmath11 kt and @xmath18 kt cases is the difference in the free energy of insertion of the cylinder with large widths of the hydrophobic stripe ( @xmath12 degrees ) ( [ results10](a ) and [ results6](a ) ) .",
    "the more hydrophobic cylinder ( @xmath11 kt ) is fully covered with lipids tails and thus its free energy of insertion is much lower than that of the partially covered cylinder with @xmath18 kt .",
    "furthermore , the free energy plots for more hydrophobic cylinder @xmath11 kt have pronounced minima , while the plots corresponding to @xmath18 kt have wide regions of relatively constant energies around their minima which correspond to the equilibrium position .",
    "taking into account that the free energy calculations presented here have an accuracy of about @xmath20 kt / nm and the minima are shallow , one can plot the areas where the free energy cost of the cylinder insertion inside the membrane differs from its minimum value by less than @xmath21 kt / nm ( figure [ eqareas ] ) .",
    "the region of equilibrium positions is wider and is on average shifted from the center of the bilayer for lower hydrophobicity .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the cylinders with wide and low hydrophobicity stripes are able to change their position within a large range around the core of the bilayer with little or no energy cost .",
    "the shallow minima of less hydrophobic ( @xmath18 kt ) and wide ( @xmath12 degrees ) stripes can also be due to a particularity of the methodology used for the calculations .",
    "the vertical size of the simulation box is fixed for both cases and the walls restrict the movement of the bilayer , and so the absence of complete covering of the hydrophobic part of the cylinder with the phospholipids in case of @xmath18 kt leaves more free space inside the simulation box to bend the bilayer . as a result , small shifts of the cylinder inside the box for less than @xmath22 nm from the equilibrium , lead to bending of the bilayer together with the cylinder without reorganization of the bilayer structure .",
    "in contrast , there is almost no free space in the case of the cylinder with @xmath11 kt and small deviations of the position lead to significant reorganization of lipids covering the hydrophobic stripe , which has a higher free energy cost .",
    "however , this difference is only significant for two points of the free energy corresponding to wide stripes .",
    "although the minimum free energy orientation is with the stripe faced down to the bilayer , an estimate can be made of the free energy of the cylinder rotating around its axis . in the cases of completely hydrophilic , and completely hydrophobic cylinders , there is no changes to the free energy .",
    "rotation of the cylinder with the stripe , leads to contact of the bilayer edges and the hydrophobic core of the cylinder as well as contact between the heads of the bilayer phospholipids with a hydrophilic part of the cylinder .",
    "thus , there is an energy barrier for rotation , which can be estimated as follows .",
    "the maximum height of the barrier for rotation of cylinder at position @xmath13 nm from the bilayer center for @xmath10 degrees will be equal , approximately , to the average of the free - energy costs of insertion into this position of completely hydrophobic and completely hydrophilic cylinders ( from which we can estimate the energy of rotation for each position ) . in all others",
    "cases the equilibrium positions found for the orientation stripe - down  will be true equilibrium position for any rotation of the cylinder , because in all these positions the hydrophobic core of the bilayer has the maximum possible contact with the hydrophobic stripe of the cylinder .",
    "hence , any rotation of the cylinder will not increase the contact area , but will significantly deform the bilayer , causing the free energy loss .",
    "our results demonstrate physical principles of the association of rod - shaped objects with a specific surface pattern and self - assembled phospholipid bilayers . in particular , a hydrophobic stripe along the axis of the cylinder can mimic self - assembled peptides with a secondary periodic structure such as @xmath0-helices .",
    "the position of the cylinder in the bilayer as well as the free energy of association depend on the geometry of the stripe , _",
    "i.e. _ the width and the hydrophobicity",
    ". this microscopic information , in turn , can be used for design of artificial polymers with enhanced association with phospholipid bilayers .",
    "within the scmf theory@xcite the phospholipid molecule is modeled at a coarse - grained level , while the interactions between the molecules in the bilayer are represented by the mean fields .",
    "the three - beads model@xcite describes a phospholipid molecule as a sequence of three spherical beads of a radius @xmath23  , one hydrophilic ( h ) and two hydrophobic ( t ) , joined consequently with the bond length @xmath24  .",
    "two t - beads of neighboring molecules interact with the energy @xmath25 kt if the distance between the centers of the molecules is smaller than @xmath26  .",
    "the h - beads interact with implicit solvent molecules with the energy @xmath27 kt if the distance between the centers of the molecules is smaller than @xmath26  .",
    "the solvent molecules are considered as spherical beads of the same radius @xmath23  .",
    "the phospholipid molecule is free to bend around the central bead .",
    "a cylinder of diameter @xmath28   and longitudinal hydrophobic stripe on the surface is inserted into phospholipid bilayer at different positions in the simulation box .",
    "the position of the cylinder is fixed parallel to the bilayer with the orientation stripe - down .",
    "the hydrophobic part of the surface of the cylinder interacts with the t - beads with the energy @xmath29 , if the centers of the molecules are at the distance closer than @xmath30  , while the hydrophilic stripe has only steric repulsion interactions with phospholipids and water molecules .",
    "this allows to describe the hydrophobicity of the cylinder with a stripe by its width and a single interaction parameter , @xmath29 .",
    "we consider an infinite cylinder , where the cylinder length is equal to the size of the simulation box in the corresponding direction , and use the periodic boundary conditions .    in cases",
    "the cylinder penetration is unfavorable , the phospholipid bilayer tends to bend and escape the inserted cylinder to minimize the equilibrium free energy . to restrict the bending of the phospholipid bilayer",
    ", we introduce hard walls at the top and bottom of the simulation box .",
    "this allows to estimate the free energy of insertion at a given position according to procedure described in ref ..",
