    "the electronic effects in mesoscopic rings were studied by using the non - relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite-@xcite based on the schr \" odinger equation with additional terms describing the spin - orbit interaction @xcite-@xcite .    however , there are nano - systems , as for example the graphenes , where several relativistic effects can be observed in the electronic transport . these can be satisfactory explained considering the electrons as massless dirac particles moving on honeycomb lattices @xcite-@xcite .",
    "other dirac materials are the topological insulators like @xmath1 and @xmath2 quantum wells with low density and high mobility , in which the quantum spin hall effect can be realized @xcite .    consequently , many studies @xcite , @xcite-@xcite concentrate on the relativistic effects considering the electrons near the fermi surface as being described by the @xmath3-dimensional dirac equation corresponding to a restricted three - dimensional clifford algebra .",
    "however , in this manner one restricts simultaneously not only the orbital degrees of freedom but the spin ones too , reducing them to those of the @xmath4 symmetry .    under such circumstances",
    ", we believe that there are situations when it is convenient to use the _ complete _ @xmath5-dimensional dirac equation restricting the orbital motion , according to the concrete geometry of the studied system , but without affecting the natural spin degrees of freedom described by the @xmath6 group .",
    "thus the polarization effects could be better pointed out .",
    "nevertheless , the complete dirac equation was only occasionally used for investigating some special problems of the fermions in external aharonov - bohm ( ab ) field as for example the spin effects in perturbation theory @xcite , the behaviour of the ab fermions in mit cylinders @xcite and even the ab dynamics using numerical methods .",
    "the persistent currents in ab quantum rings were recently studied starting with a version of restricted dirac equation involving a non - hermitian term , introduced by the orbital restrictions @xcite .",
    "this distort the results presented therein as well as other ones based on this approach , even though these may outline new realistic effects as in ref .",
    "for this reason , we would like to continue this investigation here , but considering the _ correctly restricted _ dirac equation , involving only hermitian operators , that can be obtained easily starting with a suitable restricted lagrangian theory .",
    "we discuss this topics showing first that the solutions of the dirac equation in the ab rings are determined as common eigenspinors of a complete systems of commuting operators including the energy , total angular momentum and a specific operator analogous to the well - known dirac spherical operator of the relativistic central problems @xcite .",
    "these solutions can be normalized with respect to the relativistic scalar product obtaining thus the system of normalized fundamental solutions that allow us to write down the exact expressions of the relativistic partial currents and to derive the persistent ones .",
    "the relativistic partial currents we obtain here are related to the derivative of the relativistic energies as in the non - relativistic case but , in contrast , there appears a crucial difference : in the non - relativistic theory the partial currents are proportional to the angular momentum while in our approach the relativistic currents tend to _ saturation _ in the limit of high total angular momenta .",
    "for this reason we reconsider the problem of the relativistic persistent currents at @xmath0 proposing an approximative analytical formula that matches the numerical calculations with a satisfactory accuracy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section we present the relativistic theory of the fermions in ab rings based on a suitable restriction of the complete dirac equation deducing the form of the normalized spinors .",
    "the next section is devoted to the properties of the partial and persistent currents .",
    "finally we briefly present our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a dirac fermion of mass @xmath7 moving on a _ ideal _ ring of radius @xmath8 whose axis is oriented along the homogeneous and static external magnetic field @xmath9 given by the electromagnetic potentials @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the ideal ring is a one - dimensional manifold ( without internal structure ) embedded in the three - dimensional space according to the equations @xmath12 and @xmath13 , written in cylindrical coordinates @xmath14 with the @xmath15 axis oriented along @xmath9 .",
    "then , it is natural to assume that any field @xmath16 defined on this manifold depends only on the remaining coordinates @xmath17 such that @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these restrictions give the kinetic term , @xmath20-m\\overline{\\psi}\\psi\\right\\}\\,,\\ ] ] of the dirac action @xmath21 in the mentioned external magnetic field , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is depending on @xmath24 .",
    "the notation @xmath25 stands for the usual dimensionless flux parameter ( in natural units ) .    from this action",
    "we obtain the correctly restricted dirac equation , @xmath26 , with the new self - adjoint dirac operator @xmath27 whose supplemental last term guarantees that @xmath28 .",
    "this operator commutes with the energy operator @xmath29 and the third component , @xmath30 , of the total angular momentum , formed by the orbital part @xmath31 the spin one @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , we have the opportunity to look for particular solutions of the form @xmath33 which satisfy the common eigenvalue problems , @xmath34 and @xmath35 laying out the energy @xmath36 and the angular quantum number @xmath37 whose values are determined by the condition @xmath38 .    in this manner we separated the variables remaining with a system of algebraic equations that in the standard representation of the gamma matrices ( with diagonal @xmath39 ) reads @xmath40",
    "this system has non - trivial solutions only for the discrete values of energy @xmath41^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\,,\\ ] ] whose second terms encapsulate the ab effect . for each value",
    "@xmath42 we find two particular solutions for which @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the usual pauli spinors of polarization @xmath45 with respect to the @xmath15 axis , @xmath46 thus , we find that for @xmath47 the spinors ( [ psi ] ) take the form @xmath48 while for @xmath49 we obtain the solutions @xmath50 the normalization constants are fixed in accordance to the relativistic scalar product @xmath51 such that @xmath52    hence we obtained a pair of fundamental solutions of the same energy and total angular momentum but which are not eigenspinors of the operators @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we may ask how these solutions can be defined as different eigenspinors of a new operator . the answer is obvious if we observe that the desired operator is @xmath55 which satisfies @xmath56 .",
    "the conclusion is that the spinors @xmath57 are common eigenspinors of the complete set of commuting operators @xmath58 .",
    "the operator @xmath59 introduced above is the analogous of the spherical dirac operator @xmath60 that concentrates the angular variables of the dirac equation in external fields with central symmetry @xcite .",
    "note that the genuine three - dimensional operator @xmath61 can not be used here because of our dimensional reduction such that we must consider the simplified version @xmath59 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this operator give the polarization in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "for this reason we keep this terminology considering that the eigenvalues @xmath62 of the operator @xmath59 define the fermion polarization with respect to the direction of the magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "using the above results we can calculate the exact relativistic expressions of the partial currents on quantum rings , pointing out the difference between the genuine relativistic theory and the non - relativistic one .",
    "we show that in the relativistic approach the partial current tends to saturation for increasing @xmath63 such that the persistent currents at @xmath0 will get new properties .",
    "let us start with the quantum rings where the states of the fermions of energy @xmath64 are described by the normalized linear combinations @xmath65 for which the expectation value of the polarization operator reads , @xmath66    the partial currents ( of given @xmath63 ) coincide in this case with their densities , @xmath67 , that can be calculated with the help of the matrix ( [ gamph ] ) . then , observing that @xmath68 we obtain the _ partial _ current of a fermion of energy @xmath42 as @xmath69 since @xmath70 .",
    "thus we find that the partial currents are independent on polarization being related to energies in a similar manner as in the non - relativistic theory .",
    "the exact relativistic expressions of the partial currents we obtained here depend only on two dimensionless parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 in usual units ) that are the arguments of the auxiliary function @xmath74 defined as @xmath75 this function has the remarkable asymptotic behaviour @xmath76 which shows that the relativistic partial currents tend to _ saturation _ for large values of @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , for small values of @xmath77 we can expand @xmath78 note that the non - relativistic limit recovers the well - known behaviours @xmath79    hereby we conclude that the principal difference is that the relativistic partial currents ( [ irel ] ) are saturated while in the non - relativistic case we do not meet this effect since the function @xmath80 is replaced then by the linear function @xmath81 that is just its tangent in @xmath82 as we deduce from eq .",
    "( [ cucu ] ) .",
    "this result was previously outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite but based on the non - hermitian dirac equation of ref .",
    "obviously , the correct saturation effect is given by the expression of the partial currents ( [ irel ] ) derived here .",
    "note that the non - relativistic approximation can be used with a satisfactory accuracy only in the domain where the function @xmath80 is approaching to the linear function @xmath81 .",
    "our numerical evaluations show that in the domain @xmath83 the difference @xmath84 is satisfactory small remaining less than 0.05 .",
    "in addition , we estimate that for @xmath85 the current is approaching to its saturation value since @xmath86 .",
    "the above results allow us to derive the total persistent current at @xmath0 in a semiconductor ring of parameter @xmath87 having a even number of electrons @xmath88 fixed by the fermi - dirac statistics . for the mesoscopic rings with @xmath89",
    "the parameter @xmath87 is of the order @xmath90 .",
    "for example , in a @xmath91 ring of this radius , the effective electron mass is @xmath92 @xcite such that @xmath93 .",
    "this seems to be the minimal value of @xmath87 obtained so far but it is possible to obtain smaller values in further experiments with mesoscopic rings with @xmath94 or even with nano - rings having @xmath95 . according to our estimation , the relativistic effects may be measurable for @xmath96 which means that the actual experiments are approaching to this threshold which could be reached soon .    in all these cases",
    "the flux parameter @xmath97 remains very small ( less than @xmath98 ) such that we can neglect the terms of the order @xmath99 of the taylor expansions of our functions that depend on @xmath100 .",
    "the total persistent current at @xmath0 is given by the sum @xmath101\\ ] ] over all the allowed polarizations , @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , by using the expansion @xmath104 where @xmath105 we arrive at the relativistic persistent currents , @xmath106 that can be calculated numerically on computer for any concrete value of @xmath87 .     versus @xmath87 calculated for @xmath107 ( a ) and",
    "@xmath108 when the co - domain is very narrow , @xmath109 ( b ) . ]",
    "the function @xmath110 is simple reaching its maximal value 0.7698 for @xmath111 and @xmath112 and decreasing then monotonously to zero when @xmath87 and @xmath63 are increasing to infinity .",
    "this behaviour is a direct consequence of the saturation of the partial currents that compensate each other in the saturation zone where @xmath113",
    ". these simple monotony and smoothness properties of the function @xmath110 lead to nice results concerning the values of the sum ( [ ic]c ) when we compute all the allowed contributions .",
    "our numerical examples show that when @xmath87 is increasing then the functions @xmath114 are monotonously decreasing tending to an asymptotic value ( as in fig .",
    "1 ) . consequently , in the asymptotic zone , @xmath115",
    ", we can use the following approximation @xmath116 giving the definitive formula of the relativistic persistent currents @xmath117 that reproduces the numerical results with a satisfactory accuracy ( under @xmath118 ) . note that the non - relativistic persistent current , that in our notation reads",
    "@xmath119 , represents a good approximation of eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) only for small values of @xmath120 ( say @xmath121 ) for which we can use the approximation @xmath122 .",
    "we outlined here the relativistic theory of the dirac fermions in ideal ab rings .",
    "we found the complete system of the commuting operators determining the fundamental solutions that contains the new operator @xmath59 which is the analogous of the dirac spherical operator of the central problems .",
    "thus we derived the polarized spinors that can be normalized with respect to the relativistic scalar product .",
    "the corresponding relativistic partial currents have an interesting behaviour for large values of polarization , tending to the saturation value @xmath123 which depends only on the ring radius .",
    "this property allowed us to derive the relativistic persistent current at @xmath0 giving the closed expression ( [ final ] ) .    in our opinion ,",
    "the form of the relativistic partial current is suitable for estimating the total currents even for @xmath124 by using the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "this is because in the saturation domain the currents have very small contributions such that the sums become satisfactory convergent and can be easily performed on computers or estimated by appropriate integrals as in eq .",
    "( [ intc ] ) .    finally , we observe that the relativistic theory based on the complete dirac equation is able to offer new interesting results in investigating systems of low energy as those of the solid state physics that seemed to be destined exclusively to the non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
