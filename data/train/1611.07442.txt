    "the importance of alternatives to the wigner transform in both time - frequency analysis and quantum mechanics should not be underestimated .",
    "recent work in signal processing has shown that it may be advantageous to use variants of it to reduce unwanted interference effects , @xcite , while seems that one particular distribution , closely related to the physicist s born  jordan quantization , plays an essential ( and not yet fully understood ) role in quantum mechanics .",
    "it turns out that , luckily enough , all these transforms are particular cases of what is commonly called the cohen classcohen1,cohenbook , book ; this class consists of all transforms @xmath1 obtained from the wigner distribution @xmath2 by convolving with a distribution @xmath3 : @xmath4 . in the present paper we set out to analyze and discuss the relative advantages of such general transforms from the point of view of their symplectic covariance properties and their effect on the interferences due to the cross - terms @xmath5 in the non - additivity of @xmath6 : @xmath7 precisely ,",

    ", i.e.  the semidirect product @xmath18 .",
    "as we will see , the covariance property and the reduction of interferences are related in a subtle manner .",
    "for instance , as already observed , if @xmath19 we have full symplectic covariance ; this implies , in particular , that one can not eliminate or damp the interference effect by a symplectic rotation of the coordinates .",
    "if we choose instead the born ",
    "jordan distribution , which corresponds to @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the symplectic fourier transform defined in ) , we lose covariance with respect to the subgroup of the symplectic group consisting of symplectic shears(see corollary [ cor42 ] below ) , but this allows us at the same time to dampen the interference effects by rotating the coordinate system . in the general case",

    ", it seems that the above clean characterization has never appeared in the literature .",
    "similarly , we provide a characterization in terms of covariance with respect to the extended symplectic group for the weyl transform , i.e.  the linear operator @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 , for some symbol @xmath30 .",
    "let us emphasize that the well known characterization of the weyl transform ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 7.5 - 7.6 , pages 578 - 579 ) and ( * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , the proof is different and , in fact , even more transparent .",
    "briefly , the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec1 ]",
