    "by way of motivation we present six interpretations of twisted @xmath0-theory .",
    "these interpretations inform the methods and perspectives adopted in the paper but are otherwise unnecessary for what follows .",
    "we then summarize our results on the twisted @xmath0-homology of simple lie groups and overview our main techniques , namely the twisted rothenberg - steenrod spectral sequence , tate resolutions , bott generating varieties , and twisted @xmath4 bordism .        a twisting on a space @xmath5 of a cohomology theory represented by a spectrum @xmath6 is a bundle of spectra on @xmath5 with fibre @xmath6 and the associated twisted cohomology of @xmath5 is given by the homotopy classes of sections of this bundle .",
    "such twistings are classified by maps from @xmath5 to the classifying space @xmath7 of homotopy automorphisms of the spectrum @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 is an @xmath8 ring spectrum , the classifying space @xmath9 of homotopy units in @xmath6 maps to @xmath7 and thereby classifies a subset of the twistings  we refer to these twistings as elementary .",
    "the classifying space @xmath10 for elementary twistings of ordinary cohomology with complex coefficients is @xmath11 ; here @xmath12 denotes the eilenberg - maclane spectrum for @xmath13 , and both @xmath13 and @xmath14 have the discrete topoology .",
    "there is a map @xmath15 of this classifying space into the representing space for @xmath0-theory ; any twisting @xmath16 for the ordinary cohomology of @xmath5 therefore determines a @xmath0-theory class on @xmath5 .",
    "of course , there is a natural geometric interpretation of the @xmath0-theory classes arising in this way , namely as the classes represented by flat line bundles on @xmath5 .",
    "the twisted cohomology of @xmath5 is simply the cohomology of @xmath5 with coefficients in the line bundle , reinterpreted as the homotopy classes of sections of an associated @xmath12 bundle .    the classifying space @xmath17 for elementary twistings of complex @xmath0-theory splits , as an infinite loop space , as @xmath18 .",
    "the factor @xmath19 is a @xmath20 bundle over @xmath21 which splits as a space but has nontrivial infinite loop structure classified by @xmath22 .",
    "there is a natural infinite loop map @xmath23 from @xmath19 to the representing space for topological modular forms , and so by projecting through @xmath19 a map @xmath24 . in particular",
    "an elementary twisting of @xmath0-theory for @xmath5 determines a @xmath25-class on @xmath5 .",
    "( notice that @xmath25 is the analog of real @xmath0-theory , that is of @xmath26 , and so the map @xmath24 corresponds to the composite @xmath27 ; it is not known whether there exists an appropriate factorization @xmath28 for every elliptic spectrum @xmath29 . ) the geometric interpretation of these @xmath25 classes is simplified if we restrict our attention to those classes coming from twistings involving only the @xmath20 factor of @xmath19 .",
    "such a twisting is determined by a map @xmath30 or equivalently by a @xmath31 bundle on @xmath5 .",
    "we think of this bundle as a stack locally isomorphic to the sheaf of line bundles on @xmath5 and as such as a 1-dimensional 2-vector bundle on @xmath5 . in this sense",
    "we imagine the @xmath25 classes coming from @xmath0-theory twistings as 1-dimensional elliptic elements and twisted @xmath0-theory as @xmath0-theory with coefficients in this `` elliptic line bundle '' .",
    "there is a very simple and well known reformulation of twistings of @xmath0-theory as projective hilbert space bundles and of the corresponding twisted @xmath0-theory groups as families of fredholm operators on these bundles .",
    "indeed , the space of unitary operators on hilbert space is contractible , so the group of projective unitary operators has the homotopy type of @xmath31 .",
    "as such a twisting @xmath32 of @xmath0-theory determines a projective bundle @xmath33 of hilbert spaces on @xmath5 .",
    "the space of fredholm operators on a hilbert space has the homotopy type of @xmath34 and depends only on the projectivization of the hilbert space .",
    "sections of the @xmath34 bundle associated to the twisting @xmath35 can therefore be thought of as fredholm operators on the projective bundle @xmath33 .",
    "it remains to develop a general index theory for elliptic operators on these projective bundles , but substantial progress has been made by mathai , melrose , and singer  @xcite , who prove an index theorem in the case that the twisting @xmath35 is a torsion class in @xmath36 .",
    "we would like to discuss an algebro - geometric model for twisted @xmath0-theory , and the proper formulation is suggested by reinterpreting twisted @xmath0-theory as a @xmath37-equivariant theory ; this formulation will also hint at connections with the representation theory of loop groups .",
    "as before , a twisting is a map @xmath38 defining a principal @xmath37-bundle @xmath39 on @xmath5 .",
    "the set of sections of the associated bundle @xmath40 is the same as the set of @xmath37-equivariant maps from @xmath39 to @xmath34 ; that is , the twisted @xmath0-theory of @xmath5 is the `` @xmath41-equivariant '' @xmath0-theory of @xmath39 . in particular ,",
    "elements of the twisted @xmath0-theory of @xmath5 are represented by virtual vector bundles on the total space @xmath39 of the @xmath37-principal bundle associated to the twisting ; these vector bundles @xmath42 are required to be @xmath37-equivariant in the sense that for a line @xmath43 , the virtual vector space @xmath44 at the point @xmath45 is equal to @xmath46 , for all points @xmath47 .",
    "our ` space ' @xmath5 will now be a scheme , and a twisting of @xmath0-theory is a @xmath48-gerbe on @xmath5 .",
    "these gerbes are classified by @xmath49 and can be thought of as stacks locally isomorphic to the category of invertible sheaves .",
    "elements of the twisted @xmath0-theory of @xmath5 for a twisting gerbe @xmath35 should be virtual sheaves of locally free @xmath50-modules on @xmath35 that are @xmath51-equivariant in an appropriate sense .",
    "more precisely an element of the twisted @xmath0-theory of @xmath5 is a perfect complex of @xmath35-twisted sheaves on the gerbe @xmath35 , that is a complex of @xmath35-twisted sheaves locally quasiisomorphic to a finite length complex of free finite rank @xmath50-modules . in the topological situation",
    "the analogue of the perfect complex on @xmath35 is a two term complex of bundles on @xmath39 , each of countably infinite rank , with a differential that is locally an isomorphism off of a finite rank subbundle .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this notion of @xmath35-twisted @xmath0-theory elements on the scheme @xmath5 does not depend on the class @xmath52 being torsion .",
    "we now specialize to the case ( which indeed will be our primary focus in this paper ) that our space is a connected simply connected compact lie group @xmath1 .",
    "a twisting map @xmath53 gives a map from the free loop space @xmath54 to the classifying space @xmath31 by the composition @xmath55 , and thereby gives a principal @xmath56-bundle on @xmath54 .",
    "the total space @xmath57 of this principal bundle can be given a group structure as an @xmath56-central extension of @xmath54 .",
    "the classifying space @xmath58 of the based loop central extension @xmath59 is precisely the total space @xmath39 of the principal @xmath37 bundle over @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , to an irreducible highest - weight representation of @xmath57 one can associate an equivariant map from @xmath39 to @xmath34 and thereby an element of the twisted @xmath0-theory of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the precise relation between the representation theory of loop groups and twisted @xmath0-theory is described by freed , hopkins , and teleman  @xcite  they prove that the group of positive energy unitary representations of @xmath57 is the twisted @xmath1-equivariant @xmath0-theory .",
    "a great deal of the limelight focused on twisted @xmath0-theory has come from the widespread realization that certain boundary conditions in string theory naturally represent elements in the twisted @xmath0-theory of spacetime . in this context",
    "the twistings are represented by nontrivial neveu - schwarz b - fields ; the elements of twisted @xmath0-theory are d - branes , submanifolds of spacetime with a twisted @xmath4 structure on their normal bundles .",
    "more generally , such a submanifold @xmath60 may be equipped with a vector bundle @xmath42 and the class represented by the pair @xmath61 is the pushforward of @xmath42 to the twisted @xmath0-theory of the ambient spacetime @xmath5 .",
    "when the space @xmath5 is a lie group , as in this paper , the twisted @xmath0-theory can be thought of as a topological model for the space of d - branes in a wess - zumino - witten model for conformal field theory .",
    "frequently the spacetime @xmath5 is itself a @xmath4 manifold ; the d - branes are then twisted @xmath4 submanifolds and represent elements in the twisted @xmath0-homology of @xmath5 . in this case , a d - brane @xmath60 naturally represents a class in a more refined group , the twisted @xmath4 bordism of @xmath5 , and there is a twisted index map that recovers the twisted @xmath0-homology class of @xmath60 .",
    "this perspective guides the discussion of the twisted @xmath4 bordism of lie groups in the last section of this paper .",
    "we prove that the twisted @xmath0-homology ring of a simple lie group is an exterior algebra tensor a cyclic group , we give a detailed description of the orders of these cyclic groups in terms of the dimensions of irreducible representations of related groups , and we show that these orders originate , via a twisted index map , from relations in the twisted @xmath4 bordism group .    [ thmtkh ]",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact , connected , simply connected , simple lie group of rank @xmath2 . the twisted @xmath0-homology ring of @xmath1 with nonzero twisting class @xmath62 is an exterior algebra of rank @xmath3 tensor a cyclic group : @xmath63 { \\otimes}{{\\mathbb z}}/{c(g , k)}. { \\nonumber}\\ ] ] here @xmath64 is an integer depending on the group and the twisting .",
    "this fact was first noticed in the case of @xmath65 by hopkins .",
    "the proof is in section  [ tatesec ] for groups other than @xmath66 , and in section  [ torson ] for @xmath66 .",

    "is discussed in section  [ cycgen ] , and the cyclic order for @xmath74 is given in section  [ gensung2 ] .    the referee has drawn our attention to an intriguing conjecture by volker braun concerning these cyclic orders  @xcite , namely that @xmath64 is the greatest common divisor of the dimensions of the representations generating the verlinde ideal .",

    "one can see that for the groups @xmath65 and @xmath73 the verlinde algebra is a complete intersection  @xcite .",
    "computational evidence strongly suggests that braun s conjecture is true for all groups , but at the moment it remains open for the spin and for the exceptional groups .",
    "let @xmath1 be as in theorem  [ thmtkh ] .",
    "suppose @xmath77 is a collection of @xmath4 manifolds over @xmath78 whose fundamental classes generate @xmath79 as an algebra .",
    "then there are twisted @xmath4 structures on the bordisms @xmath80 such that the cyclic order of the twisted @xmath0-homology of @xmath1 is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the index map from @xmath4 bordism to @xmath0-homology .",
    "the proof of this proposition is the focus of section  [ nullbord ] .",
    "the primary tool for calculating twisted @xmath0-homology rings is the twisted rothenberg - steenrod spectral sequence ; this is the original method used by hopkins in the case @xmath83 .",
    "the spectral sequence is : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the integers with a twisted @xmath79-module structure depending on @xmath86 . in section  [ tht ]",
    "we present various generalities about twisted homology theories ; then in section  [ trsss ] we use a method of segal  @xcite to construct this rothenberg - steenrod spectral sequence in twisted @xmath0-homology .    as the @xmath0-homology rings of loop spaces of simple lie groups",
    "are known , our primary task is computing the @xmath87 groups over these rings .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath88 this can be done without identifying the twisted @xmath79-module structure on @xmath89 .",
    "these @xmath87 groups are calculated in section  [ tatesec ] by an iterated series of filtration spectral sequences applied to a judiciously chosen tate resolution .",
    "the spectral sequences are seen to collapse and to be extension - free , completing the proof of theorem  [ thmtkh ] for @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath87 computation for @xmath90 requires a detailed knowledge of the twisted module structure on @xmath89 ; this module structure is also precisely what is needed to identify the cyclic orders of the twisted @xmath0-homology groups .",
    "the best way to identify this module structure is via generating varieties for the loop space of the group , and this is the subject of section  [ gvco ] .",
    "sections  [ gensung2 ] ,  [ genspn ] , and  [ cycgen ] describe generating varieties for various groups , compute the cyclic orders in the corresponding cases , and discuss a general method for determining the cyclic order .",
    "section  [ torson ] describes the twisted module structure for @xmath66 and presents the belated @xmath87 calculation for this group",
    ".    the computation in section  [ gvco ] of the cyclic order in terms of the dimensions of irreducible representations does not give much geometric insight into these torsion groups .",
    "we give , in section  [ bord ] , an interpretation of these orders in terms of relations in the twisted @xmath4 bordism group of @xmath1 .",
    "the main tool , presented in section  [ cocycle ] , is a cocycle model for twisted @xmath4 bordism .",
    "this model allows explicit descriptions of nullbordisms of particular @xmath4 manifolds over @xmath1 corresponding to relations in the twisted @xmath0-homology of @xmath1see section  [ nullbord ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ exterior ] by discussing potential representatives in @xmath91 for the exterior generators of @xmath92 .",
    "we review the definitions and basic properties of twisted homology and cohomology theories .",
