    "then , in order for looking at the mean free path dependence of the sensitivity in experiments , the mean spacing between pinning centers must be common among materials .",
    "a direction of the ambient field and a global cool - down direction relative to a cavity direction can also affect a number of trapped vortices as pointed in ref .",

    "the present model is applicable only when this tricky phenomenon is absent .",
    "this problem is expected to be avoided by changing a global cool - down direction relative to a cavity direction and shifting the concentration region of expelled field lines from the equator to other regions ( e. g. installing heaters at the iris of each cell for the case of the horizontal cavity cooled down from the bottom ) .",
