    "studying the response of pattern - forming systems with respect to an external stimulus provides a powerful method to investigate the inherently nonlinear mechanism of self - organization in various systems under nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "thermal convection @xcite and electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals @xcite are two systems , where the effects of spatially periodic forcing have been investigated rather early .",
    "further on , the effects of forcing on stationary bifurcations have been studied extensively in many different systems @xcite , and this branch of nonlinear science has also evolved to forcing studies on oscillatory media and traveling waves @xcite .",
    "recently , the response behavior of patterns with respect to a combination of spatial and temporal forcing has attracted a great deal of attention because of the development of flexible forcing techniques using illumination , as for instance in photosensitive chemical reactions @xcite or in electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals @xcite . for the photosensitive chlorine dioxide - iodine - malonic acid ( cdima ) reaction , as described by the so - called lengyel - epstein model @xcite , one finds in a large parameter range turing patterns . in particular , their response with respect to a forcing of a traveling wave type , which is spatially resonant or near - resonant with respect to the characteristic wavelength of the turing pattern , exhibits a number of new phenomena and has therefore attracted considerable attention recently @xcite .",
    "the lengyel - epstein model also exhibits a spatially homogeneous and supercritical hopf bifurcation @xcite similar to the one found in other chemical reactions . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the response of the hopf bifurcation of this model with respect to a spatially periodic but time - independent illuminating forcing , which enters the lengyel - epstein model additively . beyond the instability of the homogeneous chemical reaction",
    ", we find a surprising competition between a temporally oscillating and spatially modulated reaction that is harmonic with respect to the spatially periodic forcing and another one which is subharmonic .",
    "besides its occurrence close to the threshold of the hopf bifurcation , also the preference of the subharmonic pattern up to large forcing amplitudes is remarkable as well .    from a technical point of view ,",
    "our analysis is related to a previous study of a complex ginzburg - landau equation corresponding to a spatially periodic modulation of a temporally resonant forcing of a chemical reaction @xcite .",
    "while the forcing in the previous studies entered the model equation multiplicatively , the forcing enters the lengyel - epstein model additively .",
    "close to the threshold of the hopf bifurcation , we also reduced the lengyel - epstein model to a universal equation for the amplitude of the oscillations by using a multiple scale perturbation technique @xcite .",
    "we find that the forcing contribution occurs also multiplicatively in the resulting amplitude equation , but the forcing contribution to the complex amplitude equation has a different form , compared to previous studies .",
    "nevertheless , as a result of the analysis of this amplitude equation , we also obtain a competition between harmonic and subharmonic structures that agree in the limit of small modulation amplitudes very well with the results of the full numerical analysis of the lengyel - epstein model .",
