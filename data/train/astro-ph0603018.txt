    "this chapter focuses on the changes of the chemical composition during the first phases of star formation .",
    "there are several reasons why the study of chemistry in the first phases of star formation is fascinating and important . among them , two stand out .",
    "first , _ chemistry is a very powerful diagnostic _ , both of the current and the past physical conditions of the forming protostar .",
    "much of this chapter will be spent in illustrating that point in detail .",
    "in addition , _ chemistry in the first phases of star formation may affect the chemical composition of the objects that will eventually form the planetary system _ : planets , comets , and asteroids . in this sense , the study of chemistry during the first phases of star formation is far - reaching .",
    "indeed , one of the major and more fascinating questions linked to the process of the formation of a star and its planetary system , especially if similar to our solar system , is : _ what is the chemical budget acquired during the protostellar phase and inherited by the forming planets ? _ answering this question might even shed some light on our own origins .",
    "the above ultimate question implies answering several linked questions : what molecules are formed during the protostellar phase ?",
    "do molecules exist that are formed prevalently during the protostellar phase , and that are therefore a hallmark of this period ?",
    "what is their fate ?",
    "do they condense onto the grain mantles during the proto - planetary phase ?",
    "are they incorporated into planetesimals , which eventually form comets , meteorites and planets ? are these pristine molecules released into nascent planetary atmospheres during early , intense cometary bombardment ? and what is the ultimate molecular complexity reached during star formation ? in this contribution we will focus on the first questions , those related to the first phase of star formation .",
    "the story starts with the first step towards collapse : the prestellar core phase ( see the chapters by _ di francesco et al . _ and",
    "_ ward - thompson et al . _ ) .",
    "these objects are cold ( @xmath0 k ) and dense ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) condensations inside molecular clouds .",
    "what makes them particularly important is that they are believed to be on the verge of collapse , and , in this sense , they are considered to be representative of the initial conditions of star formation . during this phase",
    ", matter slowly accumulates towards the center under the gravitational force , which counteracts the thermal and/or magnetic pressure . as the density increases , gaseous molecules start to freeze - out onto the cold dust grains , forming h@xmath3o - dominated ice mantles `` dirtied '' with several other molecules .",
    "the process is so efficient that in the innermost and densest regions of the condensation , heavy - element - bearing molecules are thought to be virtually all frozen out . the low temperatures and the disappearance of most molecules , and particularly of co , from the gas phase trigger a peculiar chemistry : _ an extreme molecular deuteration_.    .summary of the properties of a sample of prestellar cores .",

    "[ tab : psc : deut ]    to the best of our knowledge , two surveys of multiply deuterated molecules  d@xmath3co @xcite and nd@xmath9  have been obtained in ( small ) samples of prestellar cores .",
    "@xcite found that the d@xmath3co / h@xmath3co ratios correlate with the co depletion factors , proving observationally the key role of co depletion in the deuterium enhanced fractionation .",

    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is a key point whose importance will be further discussed in section [ sec : chemical - models ] .",
    "another aspect shown in the figure is the similarity of the d / h ratio of the three observed molecules : n@xmath3h@xmath6 , h@xmath3co and nh@xmath9 .",
    "note that the three molecules refer to the d / h ratios of singly , doubly and triply deuterated isotopologues respectively , and the ratios shown in the figure are scaled to account for the number of d atoms . while n@xmath3h@xmath6 is certainly a gas phase product ( formed by the reaction of n@xmath3 with h@xmath11 ) , there is considerable debate on whether formaldehyde and ammonia are formed in the gas phase or on grain surfaces ; section [ sec : chemical - models ] ) . from a purely observational point of view , figure [ fig : psc_dh ] points to a similar origin for the three molecules , but this is very likely an over - simplification , and maybe just due to the common origin of the molecular deuteration , the molecular ion h@xmath3d@xmath6 ( section [ sec : chemical - models ] ) .",
    "indeed , it has been long believed that the deuterium fractionation is started by the fast ion - neutral reaction h@xmath11+hd leading to h@xmath3d@xmath6 ( section [ sec : molec - deut - gas ] ) .",
    "for this reason , h@xmath3d@xmath6 has long been searched for in regions of massive star formation , where , however , it has never been detected .",
    "the first detection of h@xmath3d@xmath6 was finally obtained by @xcite towards the _ low - mass _ class 0 source ngc1333-iras4 .",
    "however , the break - through detection is considered to be that obtained in the prestellar core l1544 , where the ground ortho - h@xmath3d@xmath6 line at 372 ghz is ten times brighter than in ngc1333-iras4 .",
    "the observed flux implies an abundance of h@xmath3d@xmath6 similar to that of electrons , and , therefore , to that of h@xmath11 .",
    "this was unexpected and unpredicted by the chemical models at the time of the discovery .",
    "it is now accepted that the h@xmath3d@xmath6/h@xmath11 ratio can reach unity in cold gas depleted by heavy - element - bearing molecules , as occurs at the centers of prestellar cores ( section [ sec : pre - stellar - cores ] ) .",
    "actually , in the extreme conditions of the centers of prestellar cores , even the doubly deuterated form of h@xmath11 has been detected @xcite .",
    "the map of h@xmath3d@xmath6 emission in l1544 shows that it is very abundant in a zone with diameter @xmath12 au @xcite .",
    "this zone coincides with the central density plateau , where co is highly depleted @xcite .",
    "this further proves the key role played by the freezing of heavy - element - bearing molecules in the enhancement of molecular deuteration .",
    "finally , one has to note that l1544 is not a peculiarity .",
    "an on - going project shows that prestellar cores are in general strong emitters of the ground ortho - h@xmath3d@xmath6 line ( @xmath13 @xmath14 0.5 k ; _ caselli et al .",
    "_ , in prep . )",
    "thanks to the above observations , the very high diagnostic power of the ground - state ortho - h@xmath3d@xmath6 line is now realized .",
    "this is true not only for chemistry , but also for the study of the evolutionary and dynamical status of prestellar cores .",
    "for example , the ortho - to - para ratio of h@xmath3d@xmath6 is predicted to critically depend on the density , temperature and grain sizes .",
    "comparing these model predictions with observations , @xcite found that the average grain sizes in l1544 are larger than in the ism ( in agreement with the discussion in section [ sec : pre - stellar - cores ] ) .",
    "finally , since very likely most of the heavy - element - bearing molecules are frozen out onto the grain mantles in the centers of the prestellar cores , h@xmath3d@xmath6 is the best , if not the only way to probe those regions .",
    "of particular interest is knowing the kinematical structure and whether and when the collapse starts at the center",
    ". studied the lines profile of the fundamental ortho - h@xmath3d@xmath6 line towards l1544 with this scope .",
    "they found that the infall likely started at the center of l1544 .",
    "we predict that similar studies with submillimeter interferometers will be extremely useful to unveil the first instants of collapse .      as for prestellar cores",
    ", recent observations have revealed a zoo of molecules with enhanced deuterium fractionation . actually , the discovery of abundant d@xmath3co in a class 0 source started the hunt for multiply deuterated molecules .",
    "although doubly deuterated formaldehyde had been detected fifteen years ago in orion by @xcite , the measured abundance ( @xmath15% h@xmath3co ) did not seem to draw particular attention ( probably because orion has always been considered a peculiar region ) .",
    "the discovery that d@xmath3co has an abundance about 5% that of h@xmath3co in a low mass protostar , iras16293 - 2422 , on the contrary , started a flurry of activity in this field , and initiated the hunt for multiply deuterated molecules .",
    "in a few years , the deuterated species quoted in table [ tab : psc : deut ] were detected .",
    "co / h@xmath3co)@xmath7 ( stars ) and ch@xmath3doh / ch@xmath9oh ( squares ) in a sample of class 0 sources @xcite as function of the co depletion factor.,width=340 ]    the best studied class 0 source is iras16293 - 2422 , where multi - frequency observations of singly and doubly deuterated formaldehyde constrain the abundance ratios of these molecules quite well to be hdco / h@xmath3co = 0.15 and d@xmath3co / h@xmath3co = 0.05 . besides , d@xmath3co is very abundant across the entire envelope , which extends up to a radius of more than 5000 au .",
    "remarkably , the d@xmath3co / h@xmath3co ratio reaches a peak of 0.16 at about 2000 au from the center .",
    "note that the dust at this distance is warm enough to prevent the condensation of co , and the gas is too warm , @xmath16 k , to favor the deuterium fractionation in the gas phase . in a few words ,",
    "the two key factors for the enhanced fractionation , cold and co - depleted gas , are absent in the largest fraction of the iras16293 - 2422 envelope , where d@xmath3co is abundant .",
    "therefore , the observed enhanced deuterium fractionation is unlikely to be a present - day product . in support of this view , the formaldehyde abundance profile across the iras16293 - 2422 envelope increases by about a factor of ten where the dust temperature exceeds 50 k , suggesting that gaseous formaldehyde is due to the partial , but continuous sublimation of the grain mantles across the entire envelope .",
    "layered like onions , the components of the mantles sublimate at different distances , corresponding to different dust temperatures . in the regions where the dust temperature is larger than about 25 k , co - rich mantles sublimate , injecting into the gas phase the co and the trace molecules trapped in the ice , like formaldehyde .",
    "when the dust temperature reaches 50 k the h@xmath3co - rich ices sublimate and so on . _",
    "the observed deuteration is therefore a heritage of the pre - collapse phase _",
    "( section [ sec : deut : pre - stellar - cores ] ) .",
    "this can also be seen in figure [ fig : cl0-deuteration ] , where the measured d / h ratios of formaldehyde and methanol are reported as function of co depletion in a sample of class 0 sources @xcite .",
    "contrary to the prestellar cores , there is no clear correlation between the molecular deuteration and the _ present _ co depletion .",
    "the most plausible explanation is that the deuterated formaldehyde and methanol have been built up during the previous phase and that class 0 sources are young enough for it not being substantially modified , likely younger than @xmath17 yr based on modeling @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : cl0-deuteration ] also shows that methanol is systematically more enriched with deuterium than is formaldehyde .",
    "this may reflect a different epoch of formation of these two molecules on the ices : the formaldehyde perhaps formed in an earlier stage than methanol , when co depletion was less severe .",
    "alternatively , present day gas - phase reactions may have changed the initial mantle composition already , or , finally , formaldehyde and methanol follow different routes of formation ( gas phase versus grain surface ? ) @xcite .",
    "although our comprehension of the mechanisms leading to molecular deuteration in the ism has undoubtedly improved in these last few years , there still remain a number of unresolved questions .",
    "first , the relative role of gas phase versus grain surface chemistry is uncertain : it is not completely clear yet what molecules and to what extent are formed in the gas phase versus on the grain surfaces .",
    "deuterium fractionation promises to be a key aspect in this issue .",
    "another open question is represented by deuterated water .",
    "searches for solid hdo have so far been in vain , giving some stringent upper limits to the water deuteration : @xmath18% , considerably less than the deuteration observed in the other molecules .",
    "one possible explanation is that observations of solid h@xmath3o and hdo may be `` contaminated '' by the contribution of the molecular cloud in front of the observed protostar ( see for example the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "a more stringent constraint is set by observations of gas - phase hdo in the outer envelope and hot corino , where the icy mantles sublimate .",
    "observations towards iras16293 - 2422 set a stringent constraint to the deuteration of water ; in the sublimated ices it is @xmath19% , whereas in the cold envelope it is @xmath20% . therefore , water deuteration seems to follow a different route from formaldehyde , methanol , and the other molecules .",
    "while the outer envelopes of class 0 sources are so cold that heavy - element - bearing molecules are at least partially frozen onto the grain mantles , the innermost regions are characterized by warm dust , so warm that the mantles sublimate totally ( section [ sec : class-0-sources ] ) .",
    "these regions share several aspects of the hot cores , discovered in the 80s around massive protostars @xcite .",
    "being `` smaller '' in size and mass , they have been called _ hot corinos _ @xcite . based on the analysis discussed in section [ sec : class-0-sources ] , the radii of the hot corinos are predicted to be around 50 au ( iras16293 - 2422 represents here an exception with a radius of 150 au ) , comparable to the sizes of the solar system . the key question , and",
    "the most relevant for the chemical structure of class 0 sources , is which molecules are found in the hot corinos , and , in particular , whether complex organic molecules are formed , in analogy with massive hot cores . more generally , are the hot corinos a scaled version of the hot cores , or does a peculiar chemistry take place ? and , how reliable are the hot corino sizes derived by the analysis of single - dish data ?",
    "once again , the benchmark for these studies has been iras16293 - 2422 . in the hot corino of this source ,",
    "complex organic molecules were detected for the first time @xcite , and this hot corino was the first to be imaged @xcite . in practice ,",
    "all the complex molecules typical of massive hot cores that have been searched for were detected , with abundances similar to if not larger than those measured in hot cores @xcite .",
    "these species include o and n - bearing molecules such as formic acid , hcooh , acetaldehyde , ch@xmath9cho , methyl formate , hcooch@xmath9 , dimethyl ether , ch@xmath9och@xmath9 , acetic acid , ch@xmath9cooh , methyl cyanide , ch@xmath9cn , ethyl cyanide , c@xmath3h@xmath21cn and propyne , ch@xmath9cch .",
    "two years after the first detection in iras16293 - 2422 , complex organic molecules were also detected towards the other class 0 sources ngc1333 iras4a and b , and ngc1333 iras2 @xcite .",
    "the abundances of the o - bearing complex molecules detected in the four hot corinos are shown in figure [ fig : hotcorinos ] as functions of the methanol abundance @xcite .",
    "note that the abundances have been normalized to the methanol abundance so that they do not depend on the uncertain sizes of the hot corinos .",
    "the number of hot corinos where complex organic molecules have been detected is evidently much too small to try to draw firm conclusions based on statistical considerations .",
    "nevertheless , it is obvious that complex organic molecules are rather common in hot corinos . in this respect ,",
    "the prototypical class 0 source , iras16293 - 2422 , may actually be representative for class 0 sources .",
    "furthermore , the abundances of hcooh , hcooch@xmath9 and ch@xmath9och@xmath9 in hot corinos are comparable to the methanol abundance and to formaldehyde @xcite , and do not depend appreciably on the source luminosity , nor on the methanol and formaldehyde abundance .",
    "if the o - bearing complex molecules are formed in the gas phase from methanol and formaldehyde , as some theories predict ( section [ sec : mantle - evap - compl ] ) , then they `` burn '' the majority of their `` parent '' molecules , and this burned fraction is independent of the amount of h@xmath3co and/or ch@xmath9oh sublimated from the grain mantles . alternatively ,",
    "if the o - bearing complex molecules are synthesized on the grain surfaces , they are an important ice component . so far , however , only hcooh has been claimed to be found in its solid form .",
    "the other evident message of figure [ fig : hotcorinos ] is that hot corinos are not a simply scaled version of hot cores .",
    "the abundance of the o - bearing complex molecules in hot corinos is larger than that in hot cores , by more than a factor of ten : hcooh is even 100 times more abundant .",
    "so far , we have focused on results based on single - dish observations .",
    "these observations encompass regions of at least 1000 au , whereas the predicted sizes of the hot corinos do not exceed 150 au .",
    "recently , interferometric observations have resolved the emission of complex organic molecules in the hot corinos towards iras16293 - 2422 @xcite , ngc1333-iras2 @xcite , and ngc1333-iras4b ( _ bottinelli et al .",
    "_ , in prep . )",
    "from these data , a few general conclusions can be drawn .",
    "first , for iras16293 - 2422 and ngc1333-iras4b , the line emission from the complex molecules is concentrated in two spots , centered on the two objects forming in each case a proto - binary system @xcite .",
    "the full line flux of the observed complex molecules , detected with the single - dish , is recovered in these two spots , which means that all the single dish emission originates in those regions .",
    "in addition , there is no sign of outflows in the line emission of complex molecules ; the emission is compact and the line profile is relatively narrow .",
    "the brightest  and so far only resolved spot  in iras16293 - 2422 has a radius of @xmath22 150 au , close to the size expected for warm ( @xmath23 k ) gas .",
    "as emphasized above , each of these two objects is indeed a protobinary system . in each case , the two objects in the protobinary have different characteristics ; eg .",
    ", one spot is bright in the continuum but barely detected in the complex molecule line emission , while this is reversed for the other spot .",
    "this difference does not necessarily imply that the abundances in the individual spots of these protobinaries are truly different .",
    "the spot with the weaker line emission is also unresolved and the line likely optically thick @xcite .",
    "evidently , high - resolution observations of complex organic molecules are a valuable tool to study the chemistry of the hot corinos , and how it depends on physical conditions , rather than the mantle composition and age , which presumably are the same for the two objects of the binary system .",
    "although the basic gas - phase mechanism of molecular deuteration in the cold interstellar medium was elucidated almost thirty years ago @xcite and incorporated into detailed models over a decade ago @xcite , it is only recently that an understanding of the effect in star - forming regions has been achieved by astrochemists . since the reservoir of deuterium lies in the molecule hd , deuteration proceeds by removing deuterium atoms from this molecule onto the many other trace constituents of the gas .",
    "the principal mode of transfer at low temperatures has been thought to be the reaction system @xmath24 in which the left - to - right reaction is exothermic by approximately 230 k. if no other reactions need be considered to determine the abundance ratio of h@xmath25d@xmath26 to h@xmath27 , the slowness of the backwards reaction leads to the stunning prediction that the abundance of the deuterated ion , now referred to as an isotopologue , can exceed that of h@xmath27 . for cold cores at the standard density of 10@xmath28 @xmath2 ,",
    "the prediction is in error because h@xmath25d@xmath26 reacts quickly with both electrons and heavy species such as co. the reactions with heavy species serve to spread the enhanced deuteration around so that typical ratios between singly - deuterated isotopologues ( e.g. , dco@xmath26 ) and normal species ( e.g. hco@xmath26 ) are predicted to lie in the range 0.010.10 , in agreement with observation .",
    "two other exchange reactions are of lesser importance : these involve the ions ch@xmath27 and c@xmath25h@xmath29 .",
    "their deuterium exchange reactions with hd leading to the ions ch@xmath25d@xmath26 and c@xmath25hd@xmath26 are more exothermic than the h@xmath27 case , so that the backwards reactions are slow up to higher temperatures , and subsequent reactions involving the deuterated ions can maintain deuterium fractionation when h@xmath25d@xmath26 is no longer enhanced .",
    "other reactions are also non - negligible , including some involving deuterium atoms @xcite .",
    "as the density increases , the picture changes dramatically . near the center of a cold pre - stellar core , for example , the gas density increases to 10@xmath30 @xmath2 and the time scale for accretion of species onto dust particles becomes so short that most heavy species are strongly depleted onto dust particles .",
    "in addition , the fractional ionization in the gas is thought to become quite low if one takes account of gas - grain interactions to deplete the chemically rather inert atomic ion h@xmath26 . since seemingly",
    "all destruction mechanisms of h@xmath25d@xmath26 are slow , a large abundance of h@xmath25d@xmath26 does indeed build up , in agreement with observations ( section [ sec : deut : pre - stellar - cores ] ) .",
    "but the story does not end here : in analogy to the reaction above , further reactions with hd convert a significant portion of the h@xmath25d@xmath26 to the more deuterated isotopologues hd@xmath29 and even d@xmath27 .",
    "indeed , simple chemical models of the densest portions show the triply deuterated ion to be the most abundant of the four ions in the series , and possibly the most abundant ion in the gas @xcite .    ,",
    "h@xmath6 and e@xmath31 , as functions of the co depletion factor : thick solid line e@xmath31 , thin solid line h@xmath3d@xmath6 , dashed line d@xmath11 , dotted line hd@xmath32 , and dotted - dashed line h@xmath6.,width=340 ]    figure [ fig : deuteration ] shows the abundances of the deuterated forms of h@xmath11 , h@xmath6 and e@xmath31 , as functions of the co depletion factor respectively .",
    "since the age and any other parameter is constant , increasing the depletion factor corresponds to increasing the density . for `` intermediate '' ( @xmath33 ) co depletion factors , h@xmath3d@xmath6 is the most abundant deuterated form of h@xmath11 .",
    "however , for larger depletions d@xmath11 takes over , and becomes the dominant positive charge carrier .",
    "a similar effect leads to the ions cd@xmath27 and c@xmath25d@xmath29 .    although a tiny region in the center may be completely devoid of heavy species ,",
    "such molecules do exist , albeit with depleted abundances , near the center .",
    "the remaining heavy species will react with all three of the deuterating ions , especially d@xmath27 , leading to highly - deuterated isotopologues such as d@xmath25co and nd@xmath34 .",
    "critical here is the high efficiency of d@xmath27 since , unlike the partially deuterated analogs , it can @xmath35 deuterate and not protonate heavy species .",
    "contrast the reaction @xmath36 with @xmath37 in the latter reaction , deuteration occurs on only one of three collisions .",
    "the increase in efficiency with d@xmath27 as the deuterating agent is especially important in the formation of multiply deuterated neutral isotopologues , which occurs via a cycle of deuteration followed by dissociative recombination reactions .",
    "for example , starting with normal ammonia , deuteration leads to nh@xmath34d@xmath26 , followed by dissociative recombination to form nh@xmath25d , followed by deuteration to form nh@xmath25d@xmath29 , followed by dissociative recombination to form nhd@xmath25 , etc .",
    "gas - phase chemical models of prestellar cores including deuteration range from simple homogeneous treatments relevant to the center of the core @xcite to shell models that can be static or in a state of collapse @xcite .",
    "accretion onto grains must be included in all approaches .",
    "the collapse can be treated via analytical approaches @xcite or hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "the chemistry occurring on grain surfaces can also be included @xcite .",
    "a relatively simple static approach by illustrates the power of the chemical models . in terms of column densities , obtain a value for d@xmath25co higher by only a factor of three than that observed by @xcite , and a co depletion of a factor of 20 compared with the standard value , in good agreement with the observed depletion of 14 ( see also section [ sec : extreme - deuteration ] and [ sec : physical ] ) .",
    "the overall computed d@xmath25co / h@xmath25co ratio is 0.3 , also in good agreement with observation . in general , models with collapse are not in as good agreement with observation because it is not facile to vary the details of the collapse to obtain optimal agreement .      as the gas - phase chemistry occurs and mantles accrete in cold sources , a surface chemistry is also active .",
    "a proper mathematical treatment of diffusive surface reactions on interstellar grains is not simple .",
    "the first such treatments used rate equations analogous to those used for gas - phase processes , and the method is still the only practical approach to the construction of large gas - grain models @xcite .",
    "the method is only a rough approximation to reality for a number of reasons , and a variety of more accurate but more complex methods have been advocated .",
    "if we imagine grains to be rather smooth surfaces on which binding parameters for adsorbates do not differ strongly from one site to another , there is the problem that only small ( fractional ) numbers of reactive species such as atomic hydrogen are present on a given grain on average . with such small numbers , it is more reasonable to consider discrete rather than average quantities .",
    "both the discreteness of the problem and the large fluctuations possible from grain to grain then argue for a stochastic approach .",
    "following the pioneering work of , a truly stochastic method was utilized by @xcite based on monte carlo methods , while a master equation approach was advocated by @xcite and by .",
    "the latter approach has recently been incorporated into moderately sized gas - grain networks by @xcite , @xcite and .    to add to the complexity of the problem , interstellar surfaces are likely to be irregular , porous , and even amorphous , so that binding sites for adsorbates are likely to be diverse , including some that contain much deeper wells than others .",
    "a new extension of the monte carlo method for irregular grains with silicate , carbonaceous and icy surfaces has been introduced by and @xcite for the specific case of the formation of hydrogen molecules .",
    "here , the fraction of binding sites with deep potential wells totally changes the character of the problem since numerous h atoms are present over wide temperature ranges on each grain . whether or not an approach of this complexity can be extended to large models is unclear .",
    "a simpler approach to different binding sites is the physisorption - chemisorption model of @xcite , where only two types of binding sites are considered for h atoms , shallow and deep . in this approximation ,",
    "rate equations can be used to a reasonable degree of accuracy .    at later stages ,",
    "the surface chemistry includes deuteration via atomic deuterium , which is produced in the gas by dissociative recombination of deuterated ions ; viz . ,",
    "@xmath38 and can lead in very dense regions to an abundance of atomic deuterium nearly equal to the abundance of atomic hydrogen .",
    "the h and d atoms land on grains and , because of their rapid diffusion and high surface reactivity , both hydrogenate and deuterate heavy atoms and reactive molecules to form more saturated forms via sequential reactions .",
    "for example , the formation of water ice can occur by the addition of two hydrogen atoms to an oxygen atom that lands on a grain surface : @xmath39",
    ". or can start from oh , which can be formed on grain surfaces by successive reactions involving o@xmath3 and o@xmath9 . note",
    "that even if the gaseous o@xmath3 is low , an appreciable abundance of o@xmath3 can built up on the surface through reactions of o plus o , or o@xmath3 can be formed in the reaction of o@xmath9 with h. there is even laboratory evidence that hydrogenation of co into formaldehyde ( h@xmath25co ) and methanol ( ch@xmath34oh ) occurs @xcite : @xmath40 , although two of the hydrogenation reactions possess small activation energy barriers . following a similar path , not only h@xmath3co and ch@xmath9oh",
    "are formed but also their deuterated isotopologues @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is currently no viable formation mechanism for methanol in the gas phase , so that all methanol detected in the gas has its genesis on grain surfaces .",
    "this statement is true even for the small amount of methanol detected in cold sources .",
    "here surface formation is followed by inefficient desorption .",
    "the results of a number of models  which differ in the sophistication of the gas - grain interaction , their assumptions on initial conditions including gas - phase abundances , and the chemical routes included  have been reported in the literature .",
    "deuteration on cold surfaces was first explored by and later studied by @xcite , @xcite , , and @xcite among others .",
    "the basic picture adopted by astrochemists is that d atoms can deuterate atoms and radicals in a similar manner to the reactions of h atoms .",
    "if we , for example , consider the competing deuteration and hydrogenation processes starting with surface",
    "co , all of the different isotopologues and isotopomers of methanol can be produced : ch@xmath34od , ch@xmath25doh , ch@xmath25dod , chd@xmath25oh , chd@xmath25od , cd@xmath34oh , and cd@xmath34od @xcite .",
    "their relative abundances on grain surfaces depend on the flux ratio between h and d atoms landing on the grains . that the deuteration is more complex than envisioned by astrochemists , however , is shown by some recent experimental evidence provided by @xcite where it seems that even normal methanol can be deuterated by reactions with atomic d on grain surfaces .",
    "all model calculations confirm that ices are produced by surface reactions , and that these ices are , at least on average , dominated by water , as observed .",
    "the large amount of co ice detected by observers is probably mainly the result of accretion from the gas , where this molecule is produced copiously .",
    "the production of surface methanol occurs once there is sufficient co to be hydrogenated .",
    "the production of the other very abundant surface species  carbon dioxide ( co@xmath25 )  is not well understood .",
    "a variety of processes can return ice mantle species to the gas phase , even during the cold prestellar core phase .",
    "the most important one here is cosmic ray driven desorption where an fe - cosmic - ray ( @xmath41 mev / nucleon ) temporarily heats the grain to a high enough temperature that some mantle species evaporate . by itself , this process will only return weakly bound species ( eg . , co , n@xmath3 ) to the gas phase .",
    "however , this process becomes very effective , even for more tightly bound species such as h@xmath3o , if the ices contain chemical energy in the form of stored radicals produced by uv photolysis .",
    "it should be emphasized that the thermal shock driven into the grain by the penetrating cosmic ray can also `` lift '' off a small quantity of larger species @xcite .    as the protostellar stage commences and temperatures begin to increase ,",
    "the `` dirty '' grain mantles will be lost partially or totally via evaporation in a rather complex process stemming from the heterogeneous nature of the mantles @xcite .",
    "nearer to the bipolar outflows associated with protostellar regions , shock waves can also lead to the removal of the mantles .",
    "in particular , heating of ice mantles will lead to evaporation and an injection into the warm dense gas of large quantities of grain surface produced species such as water , methanol , and formaldehyde .",
    "reactions among these simple molecules can then lead to more complex species .",
    "the process begins with the production of h@xmath11 via cosmic ray bombardment of h@xmath3 , followed by the reaction of h@xmath29 and h@xmath25 .",
    "this triatomic species , possibly through some intermediaries , transfers its proton to methanol .",
    "it has long been believed that the resulting protonated methanol , ch@xmath9oh@xmath32 , will rapidly undergo alkyl cation transfer reactions with other species . with ch@xmath9oh and h@xmath3co",
    ", this might lead to the formation of dimethyl ether and methyl formate , which are abundant complex molecules in hot corinos ( section [ sec : hot - corinos ] ) .",
    "however , the above reactions advocated to produce methyl formate do not occur , based on laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "a more successful synthesis seems to be the one leading to dimethyl ether : @xmath42 @xmath43 but it is to be noted that experimental measurements of the neutral products of dissociative recombination reactions show that two - body products such as shown here are often minor channels .",
    "eventually , these complex species are destroyed on a timescale of @xmath44 yr , depending on the temperature and density of the gas , to reform co. indeed , if the chemistry were understood well enough , abundances of these species have the potential to be a chemical `` clock '' , timing the formation of the central object , which has heated up and evaporated the ices .",
    "other determinants of age are abundance ratios of sulfur - bearing species , although the use of these indicators requires sophisticated modeling of both the chemical and the physical structure of the studied object .",
    "the need for such a sophisticated approach arises because the abundance ratios of sulfur - bearing species , used as clocks , turn out to also be dependent on initial abundances following evaporation as well as on physical conditions .",
    "deuterium fractionation in the ices arises mainly from reactions involving deuterium atoms accreted from the highly fractionated gas .",
    "such fractionation occurs in the abundant surface species ( h@xmath3o , h@xmath3co , ch@xmath9oh , nh@xmath9 , ch@xmath45 ) acting as signposts of a cold prestellar - core history in which gaseous d atoms are abundant .",
    "when these species are returned to the gas , the fractionation becomes more apparent . although it is sometimes difficult to disentangle purely gas - phase fractionation from surface fractionation followed by evaporation , fractionation in gaseous molecules formed mainly on surfaces ( e.g. , methanol ) is due at least initially to surface reactions .",
    "this fractionation will also be passed on to daughter products such as dimethyl ether and methyl formate via gas - phase processes .",
    "thus , the deuteratium fractionation can be used as a tracer of the chemical routes involved in the formation of complex molecules in hot cores .",
    "indeed , the fractionation pattern of dimethyl ether and methyl formate should reflect directly that of methanol and formaldehyde .",
    "eventually , reactions in the warm dense gas of the hot core will reset this deuterium fractionation to that appropriate for the gas temperature @xcite .",
    "this chemical kinetic evolution may run differently for different species or even for different chemical groups in one species . specifically , for the fractionation pattern of methanol , it has been suggested that protonation of methanol isotopomers followed by dissociative electron recombination reforming methanol will preferentially remove the deuteration from the oh group but not affect the ch@xmath9 group .",
    "the analysis may be incorrect , however , because the most recent storage ring experiments @xcite show that protonated and deuterated methanol ions undergo dissociative recombination reactions that lead to virtually no neutral methanol or its isotopologues at all .",
    "if all of the gas - phase isotopologues of methanol are depleted at the same rate , then the abundance ratios are indeed determined by the surface chemistry during the previous cooler eon .",
    "in this contribution , we have summarized new insights into the physical and chemical composition and evolution of prestellar cores and class 0 low - mass protostars . in particular ,      \\2 . at the center of prestellar core condensations ,",
    "densities are so high and temperatures so low that possibly all heavy - element - bearing molecules freeze out onto the dust grains , forming mantles of ices .",
    "we discussed the possibility that small grains coagulate into larger grains during this phase .",
    "a similar molecular depletion is observed in large regions of the outer envelopes of class 0 sources .",
    "these regions are indistinguishable from prestellar cores on this basis , arguing that the latter are precursors of class 0 sources .",
    "the molecular depletion is accompanied by a dramatic enhancement of the molecular deuteration , observed in both prestellar cores and class 0 sources . in the innermost regions of prestellar cores",
    ", the only observable molecules may be h@xmath3d@xmath6 and hd@xmath32 , which are likely as abundant as h@xmath11 or even more so .",
    "\\5 . in class 0",
    "sources , many multiply deuterated molecules have been observed .",
    "even triply deuterated molecules have been detected , with abundances enhanced by up to 13 orders of magnitude with respect to the d / h elemental abundance .",
    "triggered by the observations of multiply deuterated molecules in prestellar cores and class 0 sources , a new class of models for deuteration has been developed in the last few years .",
    "these models predict that the low temperatures coupled with the disappearance of heavy - element - bearing molecules from the gas phase cause the formation of abundant h@xmath3d@xmath6 , hd@xmath32 and d@xmath11 , which are extremely efficient in passing their deuterium atoms on to other molecules . in extreme conditions ,",
    "d@xmath11 is predicted to be the most abundant molecular ion in the gas , surpassing by orders of magnitude the number density of h@xmath11 .",
    "\\7 . during the cold phases of low - mass star formation ,",
    "grain mantles are formed , consisting mainly of water ice , but with many other molecules in quantities that can be important .",
    "extreme molecular deuteration is a clear hallmark of this phase and is recorded in the mantles .",
    "hydrogenated molecules , like formaldehyde and methanol , are also believed to be formed on the grain surfaces during the cold pre - collapse phase .",
    "class 0 envelopes consist of two chemically distinct regions : the outer envelopes and the inner regions , called hot corinos .",
    "the border between the two is where the dust temperature reaches the sublimation temperature of the grain ices .",
    "this has a major impact on the gas chemistry . in the hot corinos ,",
    "the chemistry is dominated by the evaporation of the mantles , built up during the pre - collapse phase .",
    "once the mantle components are in the gas phase , they undergo successive reactions leading to the formation of many complex organic molecules , similar to those observed in the hot cores .",
    "+ although important progress has been achieved in these last few years , it has also been accompanied by the rise of numerous new questions . for example , while molecular depletion is now an accepted `` fact '' , it is still not totally clear whether in the innermost regions of the prestellar cores the density increases so much that not even a trace of heavy - element species remains in the gas phase . also , it still remains unclear when and exactly how the collapse starts .",
    "it is clear now that observations of heavy - element - bearing molecules may not be the best way to proceed .",
    "in contrast , as we now realize , the ground - state transition of ortho - h@xmath3d@xmath6 ( and , to a lesser extent , para - hd@xmath32 ) provides a new and exciting probe with which to search for the long - sought collapse in the innermost regions of prestellar cores .",
    "however , in order to fully exploit this new diagnostic , we have to first fully understand the ortho - para ratio of h@xmath3d@xmath6 @xcite , which is not measured at all so far .",
    "it is also clear that models for the prestellar core phase have improved dramatically with the inclusion of the extreme depletions of the gas phase and the formation of the multiply deuterated forms of h@xmath11 .",
    "however , these models still struggle to reproduce the extreme observed deuteration , especially that of formaldehyde and methanol . while this is likely due to grain surface chemistry , it remains the case that , unless there is an enhancement in the reactivity of d over h , the gas landing on the grain surfaces at the moment of the mantle formation must have an atomic d / h ratio higher than accounted for by the current gas phase chemistry models .",
    "we also have little knowledge as to whether the prediction that d@xmath11 is the most abundant molecular ion in extreme conditions is correct .",
    "the coming years will likely see many of these questions answered , with the advent of the satellite herschel and , foremost , the interferometer alma .",
    "if many questions remain about the cold pre - collapse phase , even more questions are unanswered for the protostellar phase , and many have likely not even been asked .",
    "for example , the very nature of the hot corinos is still very much debated .",
    "several authors question how much of the observed warm gas , with complex organic molecules , is due to the interaction of an outflow with the inner envelope @xcite .",
    "another possibility invoked is that this warm gas enriched with complex organic molecules resides in a disk - like atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the reality is indeed that very few observations have resolved hot corinos ; actually , in just one source has this so far occurred @xcite . until more sensitive observations are available with sma and alma , the question will remain open for debate .",
    "another open question regards the chemistry leading to the observed molecular complexity in hot corinos .",
    "no clear observations are able so far to distinguish the roles of gas phase and grain surface chemistry in the formation of formic acid or methyl formate , just to mention two molecules frequently detected . the answer to this question",
    "will likely need not only more and more sensitive observations towards the hot corinos , but also laboratory experiments coupled with modeling in order to elucidate the role of the grains in the story .",
    "last , but not least , we suspect that we are just viewing the tip of the iceberg : what is still hidden from our eyes ? what is the ultimate molecular complexity reached during the hot corino phase ?",
    "do biotic molecules form ?",
    "do they play a role in the trigger and/or diffusion of life in the universe ( see the chapter by _ gaidos & selsis _ ) ?    finally , many more questions exist regarding the fate of the molecules formed through the pre - stellar and protostellar phases .",
    "it is likely that some condense again onto the grain mantles during the phase of the proto - planetary disk , at least in the outer zones of the disk that are shielded by fuv photons ( see the chapters by _",
    "bergin et al .",
    "_ , _ dutrey et al .",
    "_ and _ dullemond et al . _ ) .",
    "the same grains are likely to coagulate into larger aggregates , which are the bricks from which the planets eventually form ( see the chapters by _ dominik et al . _ and _ wadhwa et al . _ ) .",
    "how much of the mantle formed in the prestellar core phase is preserved ?",
    "do the molecules , and particularly the complex organic molecules formed during the hot corino phase , freeze - out onto the new mantles without other alterations ? or what kind of alterations do they undergo ?",
    "how pristine is the material forming the comets , asteroids and planets ?    to reconstruct the full story , we need many more pieces of the puzzle .",
    "one strong motivation for pursuing the story of protoplanetary disks is that their aftermath may have been part of the history of our own solar system .",
    "the water of the oceans is an emblematic example .",
    "the ratio between hdo and h@xmath3o ( known as smow ) is @xmath46 @xcite , fully ten times larger than the d / h elemental abundance of the solar nebula @xcite .",
    "the origin of the oceans has been long debated and new theories keep coming .",
    "the deuterium enhancement is in line with the theory that much of the ocean water comes from the bombardment of the early earth by comets @xcite , for comets show a similarly enhanced hdo / h@xmath3o ratio @xcite .",
    "other possibilities include water brought by smaller bodies of the solar system ( meteorites and asteroids ) @xcite .",
    "these bodies , as well as comets , have the imprint of the pre - collapse / protostellar phase in their ices ( see the chapters by _ jewitt et al .",
    ", wooden et al . _ and",
    "_ alexander et al . _ ) . regarding deuterium fractionation",
    ", the question remains as to what extent the enhanced hdo / h@xmath3o ratio is a legacy from the protostellar / proto - planetary phase and to what extent it has been modified by subsequent chemistry . and",
    "in addition to water , what other molecules were inherited by the early earth and how did they arrive ?",
    "as with other molecular indicators , how much of the terrestrial hdo / h@xmath3o ratio is a legacy depends on how it evolved during the various phases of the earth s formation .",
    "so far , we have constraints on the evolution of deuterium fractionation from the pre - collapse , protostellar , and proto - planetary phases for only two molecules , hco@xmath6 and h@xmath3o , and in the outer zones of the disk only , which may not necessarily be connected with cometary formation .",
    "the case of dco@xmath6/hco@xmath6 , representing deuteration in the gas phase , seems to keep a rather constant value , around 10% . the hdo / h@xmath3o ratio , very likely a product of the grain mantles , seems to remain quite similar too , at a level of @xmath221% , with just a relatively small decrease in the proto - planetary phase @xcite . evidently , this information alone is far too little to resolve the problem of the oceanic origin , but shows how important the study of chemistry in the prestellar and protostellar phases of star formation is and how much it will eventually aid our understanding of later phases up through the present eon .",
    "the coming decade will likely see many of these questions answered with the advent of the satellite herschel and the sub - millimeter interferometer alma .",
