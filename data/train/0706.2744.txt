    "two types of instabilities are known to occur : dynamical and energetic .",
    "energetic ( or landau ) instabilities exist when the superfluid or condensate is not at a local minimum of energy , and can deplete the condensate via dissipative processes such as interactions with a thermal cloud @xcite .",
    "dynamical instabilities manifest as a exponential growth of certain modes and are related to the process of parametric amplification .",
    "a dynamical instability will rapidly deplete even a pure , isolated condensate",
    ". this process will often be chaotic and cause period doubling @xcite , turbulence and vortex formation @xcite , and a loss of coherence of the condensate .",
    "a dynamically unstable bec will eventually thermalize to a higher temperature .",
    "on the other hand , the parametric amplification that causes the dynamical instability can be used to generate interesting states of the condensate .",
    "hilligse and mlmer  @xcite have shown that momentum and energy can be conserved in non - trivial collisions between atoms in a 1d system with a periodic potential .",
    "this is in contrast to free space , where such collisions are energetically forbidden .",
    "this process is analogous to phase - matching in optical parametric amplification , and has been observed with a bose - einstein condensate both spontaneously and with seeding by campbell",

    "the fact that this is longer than the damping time measured in the experiments in the collisionless regime is due to the reduced momentum width of the condensate inside the trap . in the expansion process",

    "we will now derive an analytic approximation to the form of the damped oscillations .",
    "the rabi frequency of oscillation of an atom is dependent on its initial momentum , and the momentum width of the condensate gives a spread of rabi frequencies whose sum results in the damping of the full oscillations .",
    "it is worth noting that the dimensionality of the problem can be reduced",
    ". any momentum orthogonal to the lattice does not affect the oscillation frequency , and therefore is not a part of our dephasing analysis .",
    "thus , we only need to look at the distribution of momenta in the lattice direction .",
    "the distribution is a result of the initial momentum within the trap plus the released interaction energy and would be difficult to calculate precisely .",
    "we introduce a few approximations below .    to simplify analysis , our initial distribution was taken to be gaussian @xmath59 where almost all of our kinetic energy comes from the released interaction energy @xmath60 .",
    "due to the high aspect ratio of the trap , almost all this energy is distributed equally in the two tightly - trapped dimensions .",
    "given that the lattice is at angle @xmath61 to the weak axis of the trap , the conservation of energy requires that @xmath62 this results in an predicted @xmath63 m@xmath64 .",

    "the eigenstates are superpositions of momentum states corresponding to the same quasi - momentum ( i.e.  @xmath65 where @xmath21 is an integer ) .",

    "the energy difference @xmath66 between the two states at the band - edge @xmath67 is accurate for small values of @xmath15 , and has a 1% error ( compared to direct diagonalization ) for the value of @xmath68 used in these simulations and experiments .",

    "there are several reasons that might explain the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental results .",

    "[ gpe2d ] we display the momentum distribution after the lattice applied to the trapped atoms for ( a ) 0.5 ms and ( b ) 1 ms respectively .",
    "the broad , thermal features observed in the experiment are not apparent in the simulation .",
    "however , small ripples in the condensate momentum densities are indications of linear dephasing .",
    "we observe that the momentum distribution of the condensate modes broadens slowly in time .",
    "the center of mass of the two condensates also evolve in time as the condensates climb the walls of the trapping potential .    in fig .",
    "[ gperabi3d ] we plot the populations with positive velocity relative to the moving lattice .",

    "we note that the exponential decay fits poorly to the numerical results .",
    "qualitatively , some features of the shape of the decay envelope matches more closely to that derived in eq .",
    "( [ linearfitting ] ) .",
    "in particular , the decay is slower than exponential for short times and there is a notable phase shift ( or a change in frequency ) reminiscent of the second term inside the cosine of eq .",

    "[ fig_exp_2 ] ( b ) .",
    "the damping of the condensate oscillations is at least partly caused by the linear dephasing .",
    "linear dephasing is present in this simulation , and should be comparable to that of the experiment .",

    "more favorable agreement was found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors applied a similar comparison with their experiment .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii simulation did not generate the thermal features found in the experiment .",
    "however , semiclassical theory can explain the occurrence of thermalization by the existence of dynamical instabilities , as shall be discussed below .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation is a non - linear equation that is known to exhibit dynamical instabilities .",
    "stationary states of the gpe may , under certain circumstances , be unstable points of equilibrium .",
    "that is , perturbations to the state may grow exponentially in time .",
    "eventually , for any realistic initial condition the growing perturbations will alter the state significantly .",
    "the presence of dynamical instabilities can be detected by linearizing the gpe about the stationary state , or equivalently by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations .",
    "quasi - particle modes with imaginary eigenvalues are those that undergo exponential growth and are dynamically unstable .",
    "alternatively , modes can have negative eigenvalues indicating energetic ( landau or thermodynamic ) instabilities .",
    "there has been significant theoretical and experimental research into the presence of dynamical instabilities in condensates in optical lattices @xcite . what is certain is that dynamical instabilities cause the thermalization of the condensate when placed at the band edge of an optical lattice at high enough densities .",
    "we will not repeat previous work , but simply point out that quantitatively accurate simulations of the regime in this experiment have not been performed as far as we are aware .",
    "this regime involves a condensate at the band - edge of a relatively weak 1d optical lattice , where transverse excitations play an important role ( as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_dyn_inst ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is the lack of spontaneous processes in deterministic , semiclassical simulations .",
    "accurate quantum dynamics in other regimes has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the exponential growth of quasi - particle modes is a result of bose enhanced ( stimulated ) processes .",
    "however , even with zero initial population in the quasi - particle mode there is the chance of spontaneous scattering into that mode .",
    "these spontaneous processes are very important when determining the subsequent dynamics of the condensate .",
    "in fact , in some regimes the spontaneous processes dominate over the stimulated ones , as discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we discuss the effect of dynamical instability on the condensate when one considers the spontaneous processes that may occur .",
    "the character of the dynamical instability in a lattice is dependent on many factors , including the interaction strength , the number of particles , the strength of the lattice and the dimensionality of the system .",
    "the role of excitations in the directions transverse to the lattice was studied thoroughly in ref .",
    "they showed that , for small enough @xmath15 , that there was a significant difference in the stability diagram for 1d and 3d models .    in our system ,",
    "where @xmath82 , we would expect transverse excitations to be important features of the dynamical instability .",
    "our eventual goal is to quantitatively describe the dynamics of the condensate and so eventually must perform a full three - dimensional analysis .",
    "however , we will first discuss the dynamical instability in systems of lower dimensionality .    for quasi - one - dimensional systems , one can expect a narrow band of modes for which collisions are both resonant ( i.e. conserve energy ) and conserve momentum modulo @xmath17 ( i.e. quasi - momentum in the lattice ) .",
    "these are the modes which will undergo rapid exponential growth . for the case of a pure condensate ,",
    "the process is initiated by spontaneous collisions between condensate particles .",
    "then , as the number of particles in the resonant modes grow , bose - enhancement of the scattering process causes parametric amplification .",
    "the timescale for this growth to become significant will depend on the initial rate of spontaneous scattering , and so should be included in any model which attempts to quantitatively model dynamics . at later times , secondary collisions between atoms will lead to thermalization of the system .",
    "for higher - dimensional systems there will be a much larger volume in phase - space where collisions are close to resonance , most of which incorporate an excitation transverse to the lattice dimension . in this case the total rate of condensate depletion by spontaneous scattering is greatly increased . however , as there are many more modes the effect of bose - enhancement is significantly reduced . for some systems the number in each mode may not grow much at all before the condensate is entirely depleted .",
    "in this situation the parametric nature of the dynamical instability will be washed out by spontaneous processes .",
    "note that secondary collisions would be expected in these systems too , which will lead to thermalization .",
    "thus , in systems of any dimensionality one could expect to observe rapid thermalization of the condensate .",
    "as an example , consider a system in the limit of a weak lattice ( small @xmath15 ) .",
    "in this case the dispersion spectrum is not modified significantly from the free particle case .",
    "however , oscillations in momentum due to the lattice are expected to occur . at the band - edge",
    "one would expect rabi oscillations between modes with momentum @xmath83 .",
    "assuming that the dispersion spectrum is not significantly different to free space , one would expect resonant collisions between the modes with momentum @xmath42 into a spherical shell of momentum with modulus @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "we can derive the spontaneous collision rate using fermi s second golden rule .",
    "for a system with a total of @xmath85 particles in a volume @xmath86 m@xmath87 the spontaneous scattering rate is : @xmath88 where we have substituted values appropriate to our experiment .",
    "thus , 10% of the condensate is lost in just 250  @xmath28s by spontaneous collisions .",
    "of course , this value will not be accurate for @xmath89 , and does not take into account that the atomic populations are oscillating between the two momentum states or the effect of bose - enhancement .",
    "this does however highlight that rapid thermalization does not require parametric growth in dynamically unstable 3d systems , but could be simply provided by a sufficiently large density of states at resonance .",
    "the second - quantized hamiltonian for an ultra - cold bose gas is : @xmath90   ,    \\label{fieldhamilitonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the field operator @xmath91 annihilates an atom of mass @xmath14 at position @xmath92 and obeys the commutation relation @xmath93 = \\delta^3(\\mathbf{r } -\\mathbf{r}')$ ] .",
    "it is not possible to analytically solve for the evolution of a bose gas system directly from the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ fieldhamilitonian ] ) .",
    "analytical approaches always involve approximations , and often linearize the quantum fluctuations about the mean - field as in the bogoliubov approach .",
    "numerical solutions are possible with the exact positive - p method , but quickly become intractable with sampling problems in many situations @xcite .",
    "the approximate gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) is straightforward to solve , but fails to account for any spontaneous effects that are important for the problem we are considering .    in this paper",
    "we implement the truncated wigner phase - space method for the system dynamics .",
    "this is an approximate method that goes beyond the gpe by including both spontaneous processes and the dynamics of non - condensate modes .",
    "we will now briefly explain the origin and use of the truncated wigner method .",
    "this was used in the context of squeezing of solitons in optical fibres by carter and drummond @xcite , and was first applied to bose gases by steel _",
    "an equation of motion for the wigner function can be obtained from the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ fieldhamilitonian ] ) by deriving the master equation for the system followed by the appropriate transformation of the density operator . however , for a system with @xmath21 modes the wigner function is @xmath94-dimensional and it is impractical to solve such an equation directly .",
    "however , truncating the third - order derivatives in the equation of motion for the wigner function results in a fokker - planck equation , which can then be simulated using stochastic methods @xcite .",
    "the omission of the higher order terms has previously been justified when the there are more particles than modes in a calculation and the simulated times are short  @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for the stochastic trajectories is simply the usual gross - pitaevskii equation , although the initial conditions for the field are sampled stochastically from the appropriate wigner distribution .",
    "a large number of trajectories must be calculated , which are then sampled to obtained expectation values of symmetrically - ordered quantum field operators .    as an example , the ensemble average @xmath95 is equal to the expectation of the symmetric ordering of the number operator , or @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the average number of particles in a mode is @xmath97 . for more details on the truncated wigner and other phase space methods",

    "the vacuum fluctuations will begin to interact as if they are real particles , and unrealistic effects such as negative expectation value for population become prolific @xcite .",

    "our calculations in this regime clearly display unphysical behavior similar to those found in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we observe large areas of negative population at high momentum modes , and a corresponding clustering of the vacuum noise at small momentum which swamps the condensate .",
    "the condensate is rapidly depleted as it scatters off these unphysical particles .    to proceed",
    "we must make a further simplification by neglecting the trapping potential , and instead modeling a homogeneous system with a similar density to the experiment . by doing",
    "so we expect to capture the most important physics , as the timescale that the thermalization manifests is much shorter than the inverse trapping frequencies , so that whilst the optical lattice is on the atoms will be essentially stationary and the density constant .",
    "the most important effect of the trap in the experiment is to maintain the high density so that collisions may occur .",

    "we describe the details and present the results from our truncated wigner simulations .",
