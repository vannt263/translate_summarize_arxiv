    "symmetry plays an important role in the description of many physical systems . whether the symmetry is an intrinsic part of the physical system , or whether it is merely a modeling assumption , the mathematical model for any such system must reflect this symmetry .",

    "equivariance _ of the differential equation .",
    "that is , if @xmath1 is a group of transformations which represents the symmetries of the physical system , then the differential equation model must commute with an action of @xmath1 . an important consequence of @xmath1-equivariance is that any solution of the differential equation is mapped onto other solutions by the elements of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the algebraic structure of the group @xmath1 yields important information about the geometrical structure of solutions of the differential equation in phase space .",

    "@xmath1-equivariance imposes strong algebraic restrictions on the functional form of the differential equation .",
    "this has important implications , for example , in the study of local stability and bifurcation of equilibrium points .",
    "in particular , since the linearization of the vector field at the equilibrium point must commute with @xmath1 , then this linearization usually has eigenvalues of high geometric multiplicity .    in this paper",
