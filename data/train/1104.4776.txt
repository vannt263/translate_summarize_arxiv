    "recently the cdf collaboration has reported an excess in the dijet invariant mass distribution in events where a @xmath0-boson is produced together with two jets .",
    "the @xmath0-boson in this case is required to decay leptonically into electrons or muons .",

    "this disagrees with the standard model ( sm ) background at the @xmath8 level and is consistent with a dijet resonance with a mass of @xmath9  gev  @xcite .",
    "the cdf excess can readily be explained by introducing an additional particle that couples to the first generation of quarks , e.g. using a @xmath10 boson  @xcite . in this case one has to worry about a potentially large contribution also in the @xmath11 + 2jets and @xmath12 + 2jets channels , which are only suppressed by electroweak mixing angles and by the branching fraction of the @xmath11 boson into leptons .",
    "another promising approach is to introduce a second resonance that is produced on - shell and decays into a @xmath0-boson and into the dijet resonance . for recent work that implements this and other ideas ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the excess is due to mis - modeling of some of the standard model backgrounds , e.g. from single top production  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a simple and renormalizable model that implements the two resonance approach in a compact way .",
    "in addition to the standard model particle content , just one complex electroweak scalar doublet is introduced . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the basic features of the model . in section 3",
    "we discuss constraints from electroweak precision tests and from flavor physics . in section 4",
    "we show that the model can explain the excess reported by cdf , and , in section 5 , we discuss possible other signals at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "we reserve section 6 for our conclusions and we present an appendix , in which we analyze the possible consequences of a different mass arrangement for the charged and neutral higgs bosons of the theory .",
    "we consider a simple extension of the standard model by including an additional scalar doublet @xmath13 , with the same hypercharge as the sm doublet @xmath14 .",
    "consider the renormalizable scalar potential of @xmath15 and @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17 where we have assumed that all quartic couplings involving an odd number of @xmath18 or @xmath19 fields are suppressed ( see discussion below ) .",
    "all the above parameters are necessarily real except @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we note also that vacuum stability imposes the requirements @xmath22 these conditions are easily fulfilled for the range of parameters relevant to this work .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 and @xmath13 interact with the sm quarks via the yukawa interaction @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the sm quark doublet while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the sm quark singlets . to avoid experimental constraints from the lepton sector , at this point we choose not to couple @xmath19 to leptons .",
    "we demand that @xmath13 develops a vanishing ( or negligible ) vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . in other words @xmath13",
    "is not involved in the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the sm @xmath27 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by @xmath28 . in order to forbid a vev for @xmath13 at tree - level it suffices to set the @xmath29 term in the scalar potential to zero . at one loop",
    "however , the @xmath29 term will be generated by radiative corrections :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is a cutoff scale that is naturally expected to be around a few tev .",
    "assuming that the @xmath19 couplings are flavor independent , and of order 0.1 , we get a mixing contribution of the order of 1000  gev@xmath32 .",

    "would be required , what may be obtained in the case of flavor independent couplings by a cancellation between the tree - level and loop - induced contributions , requiring a large fine tuning .",
    "it is however possible that @xmath19 only couples to the first generation quarks . in such case , provided that @xmath21 is set to zero at the tree - level by some symmetry , no large fine tuning would be required .    to explicitly forbid the mixing between the two higgs doublets",
    ", we can impose a @xmath35 parity symmetry under which @xmath19 is odd  @xcite , leading also to a justification of the suppression of the quartic couplings with odd powers of the fields @xmath36 in the scalar potential ( eq .",

    "this is similar to what is obtained in r - parity violating models , with @xmath19 replaced by a slepton  @xcite .",

    ", we further require that the right - handed up quark is odd under this new parity symmetry , while all the other sm fields are even .",
    "a consequence of this is that @xmath18 would not couple to the right - handed up quark and therefore the up quark would remain massless at tree - level . were this parity symmetry preserved , it would lead to a potential solution of the strong cp - problem , which seems to be disfavored by results from chiral perturbation and lattice gauge theory  @xcite ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to generate a value of the up quark mass of about a few mev , a soft breakdown of the @xmath37-symmetry , via a non - vanishing @xmath21 term of about 10  gev@xmath32",

    "we conclude this section with the higgs spectrum of the theory : @xmath41 the lone higgs boson of the standard model is of course @xmath42 , whereas @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the components of the new scalar doublet .    using these expressions for the masses of the scalar fields",
