    "inclusive semileptonic decays  @xcite @xmath3 provide the most accurate determinations of the ckm parameters @xmath4 and @xmath1 , and thus strongly constrain the unitarity triangle  @xcite .",
    "this constraint is particularly important : being based on tree ",
    "level weak decays it is totally insensitive to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this should be contrasted for example with the measurement of the @xmath5 violating phase @xmath6 , which is sensitive to loop effects through @xmath7 mixing , and can therefore be influenced by physics beyond the sm .",
    "the potential to discover new physics crucially depends on our ability to make precise comparison between the two  @xcite .",
    "another major avenue in flavor physics is the use of rare decays to constrain flavor  changing neutral currents beyond the sm . here",

    "the partial bf was translated to a value of @xmath1 using dge .",
    "[ fig : hfag],scaledwidth=54.0% ]    our ability to exploit the potential the b factories depends on the accuracy at which we can compute the corresponding bf s . since only part of the phase space is experimentally accessible , theoretical calculations",
    "are needed not only for the total widths , but also for the spectra .    in @xmath2 and in @xmath10",
    "most events are characterized by jet  like kinematics , where the invariant mass of the hadronic system @xmath11 is small , much smaller than the energy @xmath12 that is released in the decay . moreover ,",
    "the measurements are restricted to this kinematic region .",
    "therefore , theoretical understanding of the limit @xmath13 becomes the key to the interpretation of the measurements .",
    "a major part of this talk is devoted to the recent progress in our ability to compute inclusive decay spectra using resummed qcd perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the most precise predictions for the experimentally  relevant bf s in @xmath2  @xcite and in @xmath10  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hfag ] ) are now based on _ calculations _ using resummed perturbation theory  not anymore on a parametrization of experimental data using a `` shape function '' .",
    "this breakthrough was achieved using dressed gluon exponentiation ( dge )  @xcite , a resummation method that fully uses the inherent infrared  safety of the on - shell decay spectrum .",
    "i  will explain the conceptual differences between dge and the `` shape function '' approach , show that definite predictions can be derived from perturbation theory despite its divergent nature , and finally explain the way in which the resummation provides guidance in parametrizing non - perturbative fermi ",
    "motion effects .",
    "i will also discuss the determination of the @xmath2 bf and conclude by addressing the present theoretical uncertainty , the comparison between theory and data and future prospects .",
    "the key to computing inclusive decay spectra is the understanding of the sudakov region , where the hadronic system in the final state is _ jet  like _ , namely it is characterized by a large hierarchy between the two lightcone momentum components , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is typically of the order of the heavy ",
    "quark mass .",
    "it has been understood long ago that the leading contribution to the spectrum for small @xmath17 involves the momentum distribution of the b quark in the meson  @xcite . indeed , if we imagine a hypothetical situation where the @xmath18 quark ( of mass @xmath19 ) is on - shell inside the meson",
    " so it does not interact with the light ",
    "degrees  of  freedom carrying the residual energy @xmath20  we would find that the spectrum , at any order , has support only for @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , the physical spectrum has support for @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] demonstrates these different support properties in the case of @xmath2 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is therefore clear that the spectrum spectrum contains the @xmath25 peak ) but inclusive observables such as the partial branching fractions and the moments ( defined over a sufficiently large phase space ) are insensitive to these details . ] at small @xmath26 is dictated by the fermi motion of the b quark inside the meson .",
    "( for the electromagnetic dipole operators @xmath27 ) as computed by resummed perturbation theory ( dge ) compared with fixed ",
    "order perturbation theory at nlo , nnlo  @xcite and higher order corrections in the large@xmath28 limit  @xcite .",
    "the endpoint of the on - shell decay spectrum is @xmath29 ( arrow ) where the quark pole mass is @xmath30 gev .",
    "the endpoint of the physical spectrum is @xmath31 ( end of the @xmath32 axis ) where the meson mass is @xmath33 gev .",
    "[ fig : spectrum],scaledwidth=39.0% ]    the conventional approach to describing the spectrum has been based on the analogy with deep inelastic structure functions : the non - perturbative momentum distribution function is parametrized and is convoluted with a hard coefficient function that is computed with an infrared cutoff . in this approach the ansatz for the momentum distribution function essentially dictates the shape of the spectrum in the entire peak region , hence the name `` shape function '' .",
    "this is unfortunate , as there is no theoretical guidance whatsoever as to how to parametrize this function .",
    "all that can be currently deduced from fits to data are the center of the `` shape function '' ( the b quark mass in some definition ) and its width . even with much more precise data in the peak region , the tail of the `` shape function '' would not be well constrained .",
    "thus , the prospects of improving the precision in this approach ( beyond what has already been done  @xcite ) are very limited .",
    "a more promising avenue is that of dressed gluon exponentiation ( dge )  @xcite where the first approximation to the spectrum is based on the resummed calculation of the on - shell decay spectrum ; non - perturbative effects enter only as power corrections  @xcite .",
    "dge is a general resummation formalism  @xcite for inclusive distributions near a kinematic threshold . ] .",
    "it goes beyond the standard sudakov resummation framework by incorporating renormalon resummation in the calculation of the exponent .",
    "this has proven effective  @xcite in extending the range of applicability of perturbation theory nearer to threshold and in identifying the relevant non - perturbative corrections .",
    "the impact of resummation on the calculation of the @xmath2 spectrum is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] . in fixed ",
    "order perturbation theory one finds very large corrections .",
    "the parametrically  leading corrections near the partonic endpoint @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) are sudakov logarithms .",
    "however , conventional sudakov resummation with a fixed logarithmic accuracy yields a divergent expansion ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) as it misses out important running ",
    "coupling corrections .",
    "in contrast the dge resummed spectrum yields a stable result , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .    a remarkable difference between the fixed  order result and",
    "the resummed one is in the support properties .",
    "while the perturbative endpoint , at any order , is @xmath36 ( i.e. @xmath37 ) , the resummed result extends into the non - perturbative regime and tends to zero near the physical endpoint @xmath38 ( i.e. @xmath39 ) .",
    "thus , resummation makes a qualitative difference . in the following",
    "we briefly describe what is done to arrive at this result , and then proceed to explain how fermi  motion effects are taken into account as power corrections .",
    "when applying perturbation theory to inclusive decay spectra it proves useful to consider the moments with respect to the ratio between the lightcone momentum components , e.g. in the semileptonic decay we define :    @xmath40    where the partonic lightcone momentum components @xmath41 are related to the hadronic ones by : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the energy of the light ",
    "degrees  of  freedom in the meson .",
    "note that we consider the moments of the _ fully differential width _",
    "@xcite : e.g. in the semileptonic case the moments remain differential with respect to the large lightcone component @xmath44 as well as the lepton energy @xmath45 .",
    "this is essential for performing soft gluon resummation .",
    "owing to their inclusive nature the moments ( [ mom ] ) are _ infrared safe _ : for any moment @xmath46 there is an exact cancellation of infrared singularities at @xmath35 between real and virtual diagrams .",
    "thus , instead of considering directly the singular limit @xmath35 , one considers the large@xmath46 limit . in this limit",
    "one identifies three characteristic scales , and the moments _ factorize _",
    "@xcite to all orders as follows : @xmath47 where the factorization  scale ( @xmath48 ) dependence cancels exactly in the product in the sudakov factor @xmath49 .",
    "factorization facilitates the resummation of sudakov logarithms  @xcite  ( see also  @xcite ) , the corrections that dominate the dynamics at large @xmath46 .",
    "these originate in two distinct regions of phase space : the final  state jet @xmath50 and the initial  state quark  distribution function @xmath51 .",
    "the latter subprocess depends on the softest scale , @xmath52 , and is therefore the first place where non - perturbative corrections should be included .",
    "indeed , the _ meson _ decay is described by @xmath53 where @xmath54 stands for the quark distribution in the meson .",
    "owing to the fermi motion , this function differs from its perturbative counterpart , the quark distribution in an on - shell quark @xmath51 , by power corrections @xmath55 , which can be resummed into a new non - perturbative function , @xmath56 note that @xmath57 , in contrast to @xmath58 , is independent of the factorization scale @xmath48 . in eq .",
    "( [ calf_amb ] ) below we shall parametrize @xmath57 based on the infrared sensitivity exposed by the resummation . finally , the spectrum is given by an inverse mellin transform to ( [ mom ] ) :    @xmath59    where the integration contour runs parallel to the imaginary axis , to the right of the singularities of the integrand .",
    "we are now in a position to understand some of the fundamental differences between the approach described above and the one based on a `` shape function '' :    * when considering the on - shell decay in moment space for @xmath60 we begin by assuming that @xmath44 ( i.e. @xmath19 ) is sufficiently large so that even the soft scale characterizing the quark distribution function , @xmath52 , is in the perturbative regime : . in this limit",
    "the on - shell decay spectrum is computable and provides a systematic approximation to the meson decay spectrum .",
    "this should be contrasted with the `` shape function '' approach where one works in momentum space and considers directly the situation where @xmath61 , so the `` shape function '' is treated as non - perturbative from the beginning . *",
    "consequently , we can compute more and parametrize less .",
    "we _ compute _ the quark distribution in an on - shell quark , @xmath51 , which accounts for the radiation off the heavy quark .",
    "this radiation puts the heavy quark slightly off its mass shell .",
    "thus , the quark decays off its mass shell , despite the fact that it was initially assumed on - shell . of course , physically there is no unique distinction between this acquired virtuality and the `` primordial '' virtuality , which is `` a property of the bound state '' .",
    "this corresponds to the renormalon ambiguity in the calculation of the quark distribution function , which serves as a probe of the non - perturbative dynamics .",
    "thus , eventually we need to parametrize the power corrections @xmath57 that make for the difference between the quark distribution in the meson @xmath54 and that in an on - shell quark .",
    "in contrast , the `` shape function '' approach is based on parametrizing the _ entire _ function @xmath54 .    the functions @xmath50 and @xmath62 in ( [ fact ] ) satisfy sudakov evolution equations  @xcite whose general , all  order solution can be formulated as a scheme ",

    "the sudakov exponent has renormalon singularities at integer and half integer values of  @xmath66 , except where @xmath67 vanish .",
    "the corresponding ambiguities , whose magnitude is determined by the residues of the poles in  ( [ sud_dge ] ) , are enhanced at large @xmath46 by powers of @xmath46 .",
    "they indicate the presence of non - perturbative power corrections with a similar @xmath46 dependence .",
    "these power corrections _ exponentiate _ together with the logarithms .    , and the first two moments defined over the same range ( ( 5.3 ) and ( 5.4 ) in @xcite ) .",

    "this information includes , in particular , the pattern of zeros of @xmath72 , which one identifies using the large@xmath28 limit : a zero implies the absence of a corresponding renormalon ambiguity in the exponent , a property we call `` infrared safety at the power level ''  @xcite .",
    "the renormalon ambiguities probe the infrared sensitivity and can therefore be used to parametrize non - perturbative power corrections .",
    "let us consider the power corrections associated with the quark distribution function .",

    "consequently , the leading power correction corresponds to @xmath79 in ( [ calf_amb ] ) : it scales as @xmath80 .",
    "this high power makes the on - shell decay spectrum a good approximation to the physical meson decay .",
    "it should be emphasized that although formally all power corrections in ( [ calf_amb ] ) contribute at sufficiently large  @xmath46 , because of the factorial suppression only the first few powers are important .",

    "a detailed analysis of the individual sources of uncertainty reveals that for any cut @xmath87 gev , the uncertainty in the average energy is dominated by the parametric error assumed for the b quark mass ( @xmath88 ) ; for @xmath89 gev it is dominated by power corrections .",
    "the uncertainty in the variance is dominated by power corrections over the whole range @xmath90 gev .",
    "the conclusion is clear : a fit of the computed spectrum code is available at : + http://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/@xmath91andersen/bdk/ ] to the measured moments can yield an accurate determination of the b quark mass and the power corrections .",
    "[ fig : cut_moments ] also presents the available data for the average energy and the variance .",
    "the data agrees well with the calculations over the entire range of cuts .",
    "this comparison suggests that the data is already precise enough to constrain the three parameters @xmath92 .",
    "let us return now to the determination of @xmath1 from inclusive @xmath0 measurements . the hfag compilation in fig .",
    "[ fig : hfag ] summarizes the extracted values of @xmath1 from all available measurements based on different kinematics cuts .",

    "the consistency of @xmath1 between the different measurements provides a good test of the theory predictions as well as the experimental analysis .",

    "the calculation can thus be used to check the stability of the extracted @xmath1 as a function of the cut and , eventually to optimize the cuts .",
    "we note that the present theoretical error in determining @xmath1 is comparable to the experimental one .",
    "therefore , making good use of future data from the b factories requires more precise theoretical predictions .",
    "let us consider for example the case of the @xmath95 gev cut , where a detailed theoretical  error analysis has been done in  @xcite .",
    "the three dominant sources of uncertainty on @xmath96 are : parametric error ( @xmath97 ) , higher  order corrections ( @xmath98 ) , and power corrections ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "all three can be reduced in the foreseeable future : the parametric uncertainty is dominated by the short  distance b quark mass , the higher  order corrections are dominated by running ",
    "coupling effects which have been recently computed  @xcite , and the leading power corrections can be deduced from fits to the measured @xmath2 moments .",
    "thus , the prospects for improving the determination of @xmath1 are high .",
    "the @xmath2 bf provides a crucial constraint on flavor  changing neutral currents beyond the sm .",
    "experimental measurements by the b factories are getting more precise  @xcite : @xmath100 consequently , a very significant effort has been invested in the recent years in computing the sm bf with nnlo accuracy  ( see e.g. @xcite and refs . therein ) . despite the fact that only partial results are available  and , in fact , very important ingredients such as the nnlo matrix element @xmath101 are missing  first numerical estimates for the total bf have recently been published  @xcite : @xmath102 where the result of @xcite includes only @xmath103 terms  @xcite at nnlo while that of @xcite includes also partial results and estimates of other nnlo terms .",
    "although the two results in ( [ radiative_result ] ) are consistent , the theoretical uncertainty is substantially different . to have a more complete picture",
    "it is useful to compare the above estimates to nlo ones .",
    "ours is @xmath104 while the well known result by gambino and misiak from 2001 reads : @xmath105 the various analysis differ in many ways , and a detailed comparison goes beyond the scope of this talk . here",
    "i would like to focus on one crucial aspect concerning the evaluation of the total bf , namely the way in which the b quark mass is treated .",
    "i will then briefly discuss the cut dependence .",
    "the dependence of the bf on the b quark mass is important since the mass enters the expression for the width at the fifth power :    @xmath106}_{{f } } } , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath107 are coefficient functions associated with different operators in the effective weak hamiltonian and @xmath108 are the corresponding @xmath109 matrix elements .",
    "here we made the important distinction between the short distance mass @xmath110 and the pole mass @xmath19 , which enter the expression for the width via the operator and via the phase ",
    "space integration , respectively .",
    "since the pole mass suffers from an @xmath111 renormalon ambiguity it can not be directly used when evaluating the expression for the width at fixed order .",
    "a similar problem is encountered in other decays , for example in the case of the charmless semileptonic width one has :    @xmath112 } _ { {   g_u}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since this renormalon ambiguity cancels exactly  @xcite if both the pole mass and the on - shell decay width ( @xmath113 in ( [ semileptonic_width ] ) and @xmath114 in ( [ width ] ) ) are systematically considered to all orders , it does not necessarily limit the precision in evaluating the bf s .",
    "two main strategies have been proposed : ( 1 ) the use of an alternative mass scheme , which is renormalon free ; ( 2 ) borel summation of the expansions for the pole mass and the decay width  @xcite .",
    "the first strategy is simple , as it can be applied at fixed order , however , it involves an uncontrolled uncertainty owing to the choice of the mass scheme .",
    "this strategy was used in @xcite to obtain the results quoted above .",
    "the second procedure requires renormalon resummation , but it has two important advantages : it deals directly with the most important corrections , those associated with the running coupling , and it facilitates using additional information on the large  order asymptotic behavior of the expansion .",
    "this approach has been used in the recent calculation of the total charmless semileptonic width  @xcite . in the case of the radiative decay",
    ", however , there is an additional complication owing to the renormalization of the operators and their mixing .",
    "this gives an advantage to the fixed  order treatment where the scale dependence can be used as an uncertainty measure .",
    "instead of using some arbitrary mass scheme one can normalize the radiative decay width using the semileptonic width as follows  @xcite :    @xmath115_{\\rm fixed\\,\\ , order } , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where each of the factors is both renormalization  group invariant and renormalon  free : the product @xmath116 can be taken directly from the semileptonic decay analysis , while the function @xmath117 is simply treated at fixed order .",
    "this new strategy was used in @xcite to obtain the results quoted in ( [ radiative_result_nlo ] ) and ( [ radiative_result ] ) above .",
    "it turns out that in this formulation , and with only @xmath103 terms at nnlo , the renormalization scale dependence is still over @xmath118 .",
    "our main conclusion is that the theoretical uncertainty on the total bf is not yet significantly smaller than at nlo .",
    "one reason for that is the large cancellation between different contributions to the width , e.g. between the @xmath119 sector , which is known in full to nnlo  @xcite , and the @xmath101 one which is not .",
    "it is quite clear that the uncertainty would indeed reduce upon completion of the nnlo calculation .",
    "finally , comparing different strategies to deal with the b quark mass is absolutely essential for having a reliable error estimate .",
    "let us turn now to the dependence of the partial bf on the photon  energy cut . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dge ] the dge approach opens the way for making quantitative predictions for the spectrum .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut_moments ] there is good agreement between the calculation and the measurements of the first and second moments of the photon energy over the _",
    "entire _ range of cuts , @xmath120 .",
    "moreover , assuming similar cuts , the relative importance of non - perturbtaive corrections in the partial branching fraction is lower than in the moments .",
    "this gives us confidence in the predictions for the partial bf .",
    "over the past few years we made significant progress in computing inclusive b  meson decay spectra .",
    "this progress was achieved by dge , which replaces the `` shape function '' by resummation of the perturbative expansion and parametrization of the dominant non - perturbative power corrections .",
    "this framework provides the most accurate predictions for the experimentally relevant bf s in inclusive decays .",
    "it has passed two crucial tests in comparison with data :    * the consistency between the extracted values of @xmath1 from all available @xmath121 measurements with a variety of cuts , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : hfag ] . *",
    "the agreement with the measurements of the first and second moments of the photon energy in @xmath122 for all cuts , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut_moments ] .",
    "so far the theoretical predictions for the spectra  @xcite have been based on resummed perturbation theory for the on - shell heavy quark decay , while non - perturbative fermi ",
    "motion effects have only been considered as part of the error analysis . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dge ] , a main advantage of dge is the direct link it makes between the perturbative and non - perturbative sides of the problem : definite predictions for the parametric form of the power corrections emerge from the resummation formalism . by using experimental data to determine the power corrections ,",

    "there has been significant progress on nnlo calculations but major challenges on the way to this goal still lie ahead .    in @xmath122 , despite tremendous progress in nnlo calculations made by several groups , the theoretical uncertainty in the total bf is still larger than the experimental one .",
    "a significant reduction of the uncertainty is expected upon completion of the nnlo calculation . as in other cases , also here : the measurements are ( so far ) consistent with the sm predictions  compare ( [ radiative_exp ] ) with  ( [ radiative_result ] ) .    in @xmath121 ,",
    "the _ fully differential width _ has recently been computed to all orders in the large@xmath28 limit  @xcite . by matching the dge spectrum to the newly available @xmath103 result we expect to improve the determination of @xmath1 from all kinematic cuts .",
    "further reduction in the theoretical uncertainty can be achieved by more accurate determinations of @xmath19 and constraints on power corrections .",
