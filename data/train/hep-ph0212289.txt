    ", a dependency of the index of refraction on lorentz violation would also have to be taken into account .",
    "compared to the length change , this probably is a small correction , since in whispering gallery resonators only a part of the electromagnetic field energy travels within the material .      the materials quartz ( used , for example , in @xcite ) and sapphire ( e.g. , @xcite ) are based on covalent bonds .",
