    "these frequencies correspond to oscillations of the spin structure around three axes as schematically shown in the inset to fig .",
    "the zero energy oscillation ( @xmath143 ) indicates the degeneracy of the ground state with respect to rotations of the structure around the vector @xmath72 .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath144 ghz and @xmath145 ghz and the spin - flop field @xmath119 t at @xmath134 obtained here are in a good agreement with the results given in ref .",
    "the theoretical curves describe well the experimental points .",
    "a small deviation @xmath146 of experimental points ascribed to domain @xmath55 $ ] at @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath75 , from theoretical dependence ( see figs .  [ fig2 ] ,  [ fig6 ] ) , is most probably due to higher order anisotropy terms in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , which are not considered in the discussed model .",
    "the values of @xmath147 and @xmath148 allow to define the susceptibility anisotropy of the spin structure : @xmath149 .",
    "this small anisotropy is a result of close similarity of the magnetic structure of cucro@xmath0 to the regular 2d triangular structure , for which , if we neglect fluctuations , @xmath2 is equal to @xmath1 .    from the present results we can evaluate the spin - flop field for @xmath133 as : @xmath150 t. this value exceeds by far our available experimental range , but is still much below the expected saturation field of cucro@xmath0 .",
    "the latter can be estimated using the susceptibility value @xmath151 emu / mol,@xcite as : @xmath152 t.    theoretical field dependence of the resonance frequencies for field directions @xmath153 $ ] and @xmath154 $ ] are shown in fig .",
    "the spectra are defined by three parameters @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath148 as given above .",
    "the experimental resonance frequencies for the domains with distortion of the triangular structure along @xmath55 $ ] direction are shown in the same figure with red symbols .",
    "open black symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] show the high frequency excitation branches from all three domains .",
    "the excitation conditions of the magnetic modes are indicated at the theoretical curves in fig .",
    "the high frequency magnetic field @xmath157 is directed along the vector @xmath158 denoting the corresponding oscillation of the spin plane  @xcite .",
    "the high frequency branch at @xmath116 $ ] and @xmath159 can be excited by @xmath160 and for @xmath161 by @xmath162 .",
    "such polarization excitation conditions agrees well with the present experiment ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .    the experimental study of the magnetic domain distribution in the single crystals of cucro@xmath0 shows that their relative size depends on the magnetic history of the sample .",
    "the sample cooled at zero magnetic field has three domains of comparable volume . both , the field cooling and the field annealing reduces the volume of the domains which are oriented unfavorably with respect to static field .",
    "the data demonstrates that the rebuilding of the domains takes place at temperatures much below the nel temperature .",
    "such behavior indicates an anomalously large mobility of magnetic domain walls in cucro@xmath0 .",
    "the observed effect needs further investigations in order to test the magnetic structure during the rebuilding of the domains .",
    "in particular , it is necessary to prove experimentally that the wave vector direction within the domains agrees with the in - plane anisotropy .",
    "we note that for each magnetic domain with a specific orientation of the spin plane two different directions of the chirality vector exist . according to refs .",
    "[ ] and due to magnetoelectric coupling in cucro@xmath0 these magnetic domains can be switched by external electric fields .",
    "such high sensitivity of the magnetic structure in cucro@xmath0 to external effects makes this system very attractive from the experimental point of view .",
    "we performed detailed electron - spin - resonance studies of a frustrated triangular quasi - two - dimensional antiferromagnet cucro@xmath0 .",
    "the results of low temperature esr experiments are well described in the frame of phenomenological model of coplanar spin structure with biaxial anisotropy .",
    "our calculations reproduce well the experimentally observed changes of the character of the eigenmodes at the spin - flop transition .",
    "the observed splitting of the modes is attributed to resonances from different domains which can be controlled by annealing of the sample in magnetic field .",
    "cucro@xmath0 is an example of a frustrated triangular quasi - two - dimensional antiferromagnet with spin @xmath12 .",
    "this material thus occupies an intermediate position between the systems with large spin which are intensively studied experimentally and theoretically and the systems with @xmath163 , for which the experimental objects are still far from being a model for theory .",
