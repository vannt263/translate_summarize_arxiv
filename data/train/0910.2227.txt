    "a powerful and observationally inexpensive tool for studying galaxy evolution is the color - magnitude or , more fundamentally , the color - mass diagram , in which the distribution of galaxies is bimodal with early - types residing on a well - defined sequence at red colors that is largely separate from a cloud of blue late - types ( e.g. blanton et  al .",
    "recent deep surveys have enabled the study of the evolution over @xmath5 of luminosity ( bell et  al . , 2004 , hereafter b04 ;  brown et  al . 2007 ; faber et  al .",
    "2007 ) and mass ( borch et  al . 2006 ) functions divided between red and blue samples selected based on color - magnitude and color - mass diagrams .",
    "a primary result of these studies is that the stellar mass in red galaxies builds up by a factor of @xmath62 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while the stellar mass in blue galaxies remains roughly constant over the same redshift range .",
    "this may imply a migration from the blue to red sequences ( b04 ; faber et  al .",
    "2007 ) . in the simplest models",
    "the evolution from blue to red colors is largely driven by simple aging of stellar populations , with the rate of objects entering the red sequence modulated by the particular feedback processes at work that regulate star formation ( e.g. , schawinski et  al . 2007 ) .",
    "recently , several surveys have started to push the systematic study of galaxy colors to @xmath9 .",
    "there is some evidence that the color bimodality persists up to @xmath10 , though the contrast separating the red and blue sequences is low .",
    "this is either because spectroscopic samples that span a broad range of colors are small ( giallongo et  al . 2005 ; franzetti et  al .",
    "2007 ; cassata et  al . 2008 ; kriek et  al . 2008 ) or because larger photometric samples suffer from uncertain photometric redshifts at @xmath11 , which leads to uncertain rest - frame colors ( taylor et  al .",

    "in this letter we use the newfirm medium band survey ( nmbs ; van dokkum et  al .",
    "2009 ) to explore the evolution of the galaxy color bimodality over @xmath1 .",
    "we show that two independent methods for accounting for dust in objects with intermediate colors allows the separation of a clearly - defined red sequence up to at least @xmath4 .",
    "we assume a @xmath13cdm cosmology with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 throughout .",
    "broad - band magnitudes and colors are given in the ab system .",
    "we use data from the nmbs , a moderately wide , moderately deep survey using five unique medium - bandwidth near - ir filters designed to sample the balmer/4000  break at @xmath17 with roughly twice the spectral resolution as the standard broadband @xmath18 filters ( van dokkum et  al .",

    "we are primarily concerned with whether or not an object is detected with 4mum  flux , @xmath23 .",
    "we restrict the sample described in this letter to the 24,800 objects that lie within the @xmath6@xmath24 overlap area covered by both the nmbs and mips images .",
    "we estimate photometric redshifts from the full @xmath25 seds described above using the eazy code ( brammer , van dokkum , & coppi 2008 ) .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the eazy  and spectroscopic redshifts measured by the @xmath26cosmos ( lilly et  al .",
    "2007 ) and deep2 ( davis et  al . 2003 ) surveys : for 632 objects with @xmath27 from @xmath26cosmos , @xmath28 , and for 2316 objects with @xmath29 from deep2 , @xmath30 , with 3% @xmath31 outliers .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , however , that these spectroscopic samples have significantly different selection functions , and thus will not be representative of the full @xmath32-selected sample used here .",

    "they find @xmath34 for the four brightest galaxies .",
    "when 10 galaxies with @xmath35 in the nmbs filters are included the scatter increases to @xmath60.02 , which is much smaller than has been achieved with broad - band filters at these redshifts .",
    "this redshift precision is similar to that of the combo-17 survey , which pioneered the use of medium - band _ optical _ filters to determine accurate photometric redshifts and colors at @xmath36 ( wolf et  al .",
    "2003 ; b04 ) .",
    "we compute rest - frame @xmath0 colors from the best - fit eazy template in a similar way as done by wolf et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) for combo-17 .",

    "2009b ) when closely - spaced medium - band or overlapping broad - band observed filters are used ( brammer , in prep ) .",
    "the results below remain the same for both methods of estimating rest - frame colors . with @xmath26",
    "fixed to the eazy output , we use the sed modeling code , fast ( kriek et  al .",
    "2009 ) , to estimate the stellar masses , star formation rates , and dust content , parameterized by the extinction in the @xmath37 band ( @xmath38 ) , of all galaxies in our sample . with fast",
    ", we use a grid of maraston ( 2005 ) models computed with a kroupa ( 2001 ) imf that have exponentially - declining star - formation histories with decline rates , @xmath39 , and we allow dust extinction with @xmath40 following the calzetti et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) extinction law .",
    "adopting an imf without a turnover at low masses ( e.g. salpeter 1955 ) will cause a shift in the derived stellar masses without significantly changing the other properties derived from the sed fit .",
    "the left panel of figure [ f : uv_z_av ] shows the rest - frame @xmath0 color plotted versus redshift , @xmath26 , for all galaxies in our sample .",
    "the slope of the color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) at a given redshift was removed using the non - evolving cmr slope of b04 , @xmath41 this correction is only valid for galaxies on the red sequence and is the cause of the strong color evolution of the blue cloud at @xmath42 , where galaxies with low luminosities and correspondingly large color corrections enter the flux - limited sample .",
    "our conclusions do not critically depend on the assumed ( non-)evolution of the cmr slope ; we find the same general trends described below assuming the evolving slope of stott et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( see figure [ f : average_av ] ) .    a number of observations can be made immediately from figure [ f : uv_z_av ] .",
    "first , and a key result of this letter is that a bimodal color distribution persists up to the highest redshifts ( @xmath4 ) where the nmbs is reasonably complete .",
    "the number of red objects in the nmbs drops off sharply at @xmath12 , which is likely due to incompleteness for all but the highest stellar masses and a consequence of the @xmath32-band selection .",
    "proper analysis of the number density evolution of the red and blue sequences will require more careful selection based on more physical properties , such as stellar mass , which we will present in a forthcoming paper ( brammer , in prep ) .",
    "a second result clear from figure [ f : uv_z_av ] is that the color of the red peak evolves slowly with redshift and is a natural extension of the red peak found at @xmath5 by b04 .",
    "the color evolution of the blue peak is rather similar . finally , the mips - detected objects have rest - frame colors that fall between the red and blue sequences ( see also figure [ f : average_av ] ) , which has been found previously by cowie & barger ( 2008 ) and salim et  al . ( 2009 ) at @xmath43 but that we extend here to significantly higher redshifts ( see also w09 ) .",
    "the contrast between the red and blue sequences is greatly enhanced when the mips - detected objects are removed . note that here we are considering as the red sequence the red peak of cmr - corrected colors as a function of redshift .",
    "we show that this interpretation is consistent with the more traditional definition of the red sequence in the color - mass diagram in  [ s : red_sequence ] .",
    "the @xmath0 colors of the mips - detected galaxies suggest that the green valley is largely populated by dusty star - forming galaxies .",
    "figure [ f : average_av ] shows @xmath38 from the sed fit as a function of @xmath0 color , which is now corrected for both the slope of the cmr and for the b04 evolution of the cmr zeropoint with redshift ( see figure [ f : uv_z_av ] ) .",
    "objects on the red sequence are clearly visible as the clump at corrected @xmath44 with low @xmath38 values and very low ssfr .",
    "some galaxies in the red clump have @xmath45 or larger , which is perhaps larger than might be expected for truly `` red and dead '' galaxies , but the 1@xmath46 error on @xmath38 estimated by fast includes zero for most of these galaxies .",
    "the median @xmath38 ( thick black curve in figure [ f : average_av ] ) peaks in the green valley , demonstrating that it is indeed populated at redder colors by increasingly dusty objects ( see also w07 ; w09 ) . a green valley with colors determined primarily by aging stellar populations",
    "would be horizontal on this figure .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ f : average_av ] ( see also figure [ f : seds ] ) shows that the color distribution of objects with mips detections ( negative red histogram ) is similar to the distribution of objects with @xmath47 ( positive line - filled histogram ) .",
    "the relative contributions of star - formation and agn to the 4mum  flux are difficult to assess here , particularly because the adopted mips flux limit corresponds to a large range of mir luminosity , sampled at a broad range of rest - frame wavelengths , over the redshift range considered .",
    "only @xmath61% of the galaxies in figure [ f : average_av ] have x - ray counterparts , which implies that powerful agn are probably not the dominant source of mips flux in the green valley .",
    "figure [ f : average_av ] demonstrates that the overlapping dusty - starburst and passive galaxy populations at the reddest @xmath0 colors have seds that can be easily distinguished with the nmbs photometry .",
    "we explore this separation further in figure [ f : cmd ] , which shows the color - mass diagram at @xmath48 where the the right panel shows the rest - frame @xmath0 color corrected for dust reddening with the correction factor , @xmath49 computed for the calzetti et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) extinction law . after the reddening correction the galaxies collapse into",
    "strikingly well - defined red and blue sequences , now in the traditional sense of the terms .",
    "we remark , though , that the color - mass diagram shown is somewhat more model - dependent than a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "figure [ f : cmd ] extends to significantly higher redshift and with good statistics the results found by wyder et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( @xmath50 ) and cowie & barger ( 2008 ) ( @xmath51 ) , who show that the blue and red sequences are more easily separated in the cmd if one considers de - reddened colors .",
    "similarly , many red objects at @xmath50 have intrinsic colors that put them on the blue sequence when the extinction effects of inclined disk galaxies are taken into account ( martin et  al . 2007 ; bailin & harris 2008 ; maller et  al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "there is some question as to how well @xmath38 can be estimated from the sed fit , since there are complicated degeneracies between the parameters of the fit ( @xmath38 , age , sfh , @xmath52 ) .",
    "figure [ f : seds ] demonstrates that there are real differences in the sed shapes for galaxies with similar @xmath0 colors but different values of derived @xmath38 .",
    "the combination of the medium - band nir filters and the irac photometry at @xmath53 traces the detailed shape of the sed near the balmer/4000  break and determines the sed slope redward of the break ( i.e. the @xmath54 color ) , which allows the separation of dusty and passive sed types with similar @xmath0 colors ( labb et  al . 2005 ; w07 ; w09 ) .",
    "we have shown that either removing mips - detected galaxies or applying a reddening correction to rest - frame @xmath0 colors allows us to cleanly divide the population of galaxies with red rest - frame colors among dusty - starburst and `` red and dead '' galaxies .",
    "the latter , which have _ intrinsically _ red colors characteristic of evolved stellar populations , form what we call the `` dead sequence '' , which is in place at all @xmath55 .",
    "this term was used previously by romeo et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who consider the sub - sample of red - sequence galaxies with @xmath56 ; figure [ f : cmd ] shows that the cloud of galaxies with red dust - corrected colors do , in fact , have very low ssfr .",
    "we note , however , that there could be galaxies on what we consider the `` dead sequence '' with somewhat higher ssfr than in romeo et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) .    obtaining these results at @xmath57",
    "is made possible by the newfirm medium - band survey , which provides high - quality  and well - sampled seds of red galaxies at redshifts beyond the current limits of large spectroscopic surveys ( van dokkum et  al .",
    "2009 ) : of the @xmath63000 nmbs objects with measured spectroscopic redshifts , only 9 have @xmath58 at @xmath59 .",
    "conversely , there are 2826 objects that satisfy these criteria in the full photometric sample",
    ".    the results presented here are consistent with those of w09 , who show that quiescent galaxies can be separated from dusty star - forming galaxies in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath60 color - color diagram out to @xmath10 .",
    "the reddening - corrected dead sequence galaxies discussed here fall nicely within the @xmath61 quiescent selection criteria , though the reddening correction is critical for detecting the bimodal color distribution in a color - mass diagram at @xmath11 , explaining why it is not seen by w09 .",
    "we find the color evolution of dead sequence galaxies to be consistent with that found by b04 , who show that it can be roughly explained by simple stellar populations formed at @xmath62 that age passively to the present day .",
    "we show , however , that additional care must be taken when defining red sequence galaxy samples as done by , e.g. , b04 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ f : average_av ] shows that a red galaxy selection based on a single rest - frame color will contain a significant fraction of dusty - starburst galaxies ( @xmath620% with @xmath47 ) that would otherwise be much bluer ( see also cimatti et  al .",
    "2002 ; brammer & van dokkum 2007 ; w07 ; gallazzi et  al .",
    "2009 ; w09 ; wolf et  al .",
    "the reddening correction dramatically reduces the number of objects in the green valley , so such a correction would be necessary when using those objects to estimate the rate at which galaxies move from the blue to red sequences ( martin et  al .",
    "for example , a sparsely - populated green valley at most redshifts could constrain the rate at which star - forming galaxies are quenched , which in turn may help constrain the processes that regulate star formation in theoretical models .    as might be expected , the large majority of objects detected at 4mum  have reddening - corrected colors that place them on the blue - sequence ( reddy et  al .",
    "2006 , see also figure 3 ) .",
    "a number of mips - detected galaxies , however , remain on the red sequence even after applying the reddening correction : roughly one in seven mips objects have dust - corrected colors within @xmath63 mag of the red sequence ridgeline drawn in figure [ f : uv_z_av ] .",
    "the dead sequence galaxies detected with mips have de - reddened colors that are slightly bluer than those without mips detections ( figure [ f : cmd ] ) .",
    "this could perhaps be due to low levels of recent star formation or to agn contamination of the uv - optical light , though this tentative result requires more detailed investigation because , for example , it is not clear that the dust correction or even the extinction law itself are appropriate for these galaxies .",
    "figures [ f : uv_z_av ] and [ f : cmd ] demonstrate that the dead sequence persists to @xmath64 , which is consistent with the discovery of a small ( spectroscopic ) sample of red sequence objects with low ssfr at @xmath65 described by kriek et  al .",
    "such studies of red sequence galaxies found among the field are complementary to others that target the higher density environments of clusters at @xmath66 ( e.g. , mei et  al .",
    "2009 ) and proto - clusters at @xmath12 ( zirm et  al .",
    "mechanisms that have been proposed to suppress star formation in massive galaxies , including the much - discussed feedback from agn and gravitational heating from cosmological accretion ( naab et  al . 2007 ; dekel & birnboim 2008 ) , must be able to explain the formation of the dead sequence in a variety of environments as early as @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we note that quantitative constraints on the assembly and evolution of passively - evolving galaxies require studies of the evolution of their mass function , possibly combined with structural information ( see , e.g. , b04 ; faber et  al .",
    "2007 ; cimatti et  al . 2008",
    "; van dokkum et  al .",
    "2008 , and many other studies ) .",
    "the nmbs is ideally suited to help disentangle these processes by providing accurate photometric redshifts and colors over a large area in the redshift regime of the most rapid build - up of massive galaxies .",
