    "the standard flat universe inflationary plus dark energy paradigm appears to be remarkable accord with recent cmb experiments @xcite . nevertheless , the confrontation with observation remains indecisive , not only because of the significant experimental uncertainties , but also because good quantitative accuracy has not yet been achieved for competing paradigms such as actively sourced theories , which have so far only been extensively studied for cosmic defects in flat frw ( @xmath3 ) backgrounds @xcite .",
    "moreover , even for flat universes , a subsidiary role for defect networks complementing the inflationary power spectrum can not be excluded @xcite .",
    "the possibilty of searching for distinct defect signatures in the cmb , such as nongaussianity @xcite or in the polarisation spectra @xcite may go some way toward resolving these remaining uncertainties .",
    "however , in order to have confidence in cosmological parameter estimation with a purely inflationary paradigm , it will be necessary to constrain the alternative models , including both ` primordial ' and ` active ' perturbation sources , as well as the effects of vector and tensor modes and @xmath4 backgrounds . here",
    "the combination of intrinsic curvature and defect sources is particularly interesting , motivating a study of the superhorizon behaviour and the choice of consistent initial conditions for such perturbations .",
    "of particular interest is the possibility of a testable signature of superhorizon fall - off in ` causal ' or ` active ' models in the cmb polarisation power spectrum .",
    "the cauchy problem for cosmological perturbations over a @xmath3 frw background has been extensively discussed in the literature . using energy - momentum conservation , and assuming that the early universe was purely homogeneous and isotropic , one can show @xcite that the power spectrum of the stresses should be that of white noise ( @xmath5 ) , while that of the density should be suppressed as @xmath0 , for wavelengths much larger than the horizon ; here , @xmath6 is the comoving wavenumber so this the superhorizon condition is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the scale factor . assuming that matter undergoes random displacements of length @xmath10 at each point in space , while satisfying energy - momentum conservation , one can estimate that the density power spectrum turns over to @xmath0 behaviour at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this result may be used @xcite to simplify the calculations to determine consistent initial conditions for numerical analyses .",
    "one assumes that all perturbations of relevance today come from far outside the initial horizon ( @xmath12 ) so that one may argue that the strong @xmath0 suppression allows us to set all these variables to zero initially .    for the general @xmath1 frw cosmologies , these issues remain unaddressed ,",
    "although there do exist several analyses of the effect of curvature on the cmb assuming primordial inflationary perturbations described by power law ansatzes .",
    "some examples include : the generalisation of the sachs - wolfe effect to include curvature effects @xcite ; refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite treat the open universe case , respectively using a gauge invariant and a synchronous gauge formalism  see also ref .",
    "@xcite  and ref .",
    "@xcite investigated the closed universe case , again using a gauge invariant approach .",
    "however , the literature does not contain ( to our knowledge ) any direct analysis of the superhorizon effects of energy - momentum conservation on active and causal seed sources in intrinsically curved frw spacetimes .",
    "in this paper we shall therefore describe the manner in which causality and energy - momentum conservation constrain the superhorizon behaviour of the perturbation variables in the general frw spacetime , in curvilinear coordinates . as discussed in our previous paper  ref .",
    "@xcite  we may describe the symmetry properties and stress energy conservation laws of these spacetimes in two equivalent languages corresponding to integral and differential conservation laws . the language of conserved vector densities @xmath13 ( _ c.f .",
    "_ katz @xcite ) uses the conformal geometry of the background spacetime to naturally construct integral constraint equations , representing strong conservation laws defined over some region of a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "these reduce to noether conservation laws when constructed using the killing geometry of the background .",
    "traschen @xcite obtained such integral constraints using as a background manifold a maximally symmetric de sitter spacetime in quasi ",
    "minkowskian coordinates , and these were related to the vector densities @xmath14 by dereulle @xcite .",
    "however , in order to make use of these integral constraints , we need to know their behaviour on the boundary of the integration volume . in the case of",
    "bounded ( or `` local '' ) perturbations , the boundary terms are assumed to vanish , that is , these previous analyses consider perturbations whose stress energy vanishes beyond the horizon .",
    "this is a stronger assumption than required by the physics , since only the two - point correlators between these quantities have to vanish in order to satisfy causality . in other words ,",
    "a physical assumption has been made that is perhaps better suited to the analysis of an explosive event rather than more general causal perturbations , such as those seeded by topological defects , which may persist beyond the horizon ( _ e.g. _ cosmic strings ) .",
    "moreover , the choice of background relative to which energy - momentum is formally defined is that of a de sitter universe , rather than the frw background convenient for most simulations .    hence , we turn to the equivalent language of energy - momentum pseudo - tensors @xcite , outlined in  [ sec - em ] . again , the relative simplicity of the flat space case is complicated by the introduction of curvature . in  [ int - k4sec ] we define the two  point correlator , and discuss causality , while the transformed correlator ( with respect to the eigenfunctions of the laplacian ) is described in  [ tcor - k4sec ] .",
    "the effect of intrinsic curvature upon the horizon scale is dealt with in  [ hs - k4sec ] ; and in  [ wn - k4sec ] we obtain results for a general frw spacetime analogous to the white noise power spectrum of two arbitrary functions in flat space .",
    "then , in  [ sec - shiso ] , we consider in more detail the superhorizon behaviour of the pseudo - energy .",
    "this not only yields the familiar @xmath0 behaviour for the isotropic ( @xmath15-)mode on superhorizon scales for @xmath3 , but is also well suited to study the @xmath1 case .",
    "we regain the flat space results in the local limit and discuss the effects of intrinsic curvature on the isotropic mode in a helmholtz decomposition of the density perturbation associated with causal sources , for both open and closed cosmologies . in  [ initcon ]",
    "we comment on the implications of these results for the choice of consistent initial conditions .",
    "we work in the synchronous gauge because of its ubiquity in numerical simulations and the greater physical transparency offered by this gauge choice .",

    "we have also separated the perturbed energy - momentum tensor into two parts : the first order part @xmath34 incorporates the stress energy of the radiation fluid , baryonic matter , and cold dark matter , and a contribution @xmath35 representing the stress tensor of an evolving defect network or some other causal sources .",
    "this is assumed to be small ( of order @xmath34 ) and ` stiff ' , that is , its energy and momenta are conserved independently of the rest of the matter and radiation in the universe and to lowest order its evolution is unaffected by the metric perturbations @xmath16 .",
    "the components ( [ tau - def1 ] ) may be simply related to conserved vector densities @xmath13 obtained by defining energy and momenta with respect to a general frw background @xcite , and therefore represent a locally valid definition of these quantities .",
    "the conservation equations for these quantities are @xmath36 where the bar denotes covariant differentiation with respect to the spatial three metric @xmath37 .",
    "the pseudo - energy @xmath38 is a particularly useful variable for tracking the growth of large - structure which is why we focus on it in this paper . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that pseudo - energy is proportional to the growing mode of the density perturbation on superhorizon scales whether the universe is dominated by radiation , matter or curvature ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we briefly discussed the implications of matching conditions at an instantaneous phase transition , with particular emphasis on the choice of consistent initial conditions .",
    "however , a more thorough treatment requires that we consider not the perturbations themselves , but rather their correlators .",
    "causality is usually defined in terms of two  point correlation functions , which contain all the information pertinent to gaussian perturbations @xcite . if two random functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are assumed to be statistically spatially homogeneous and isotropic , then their two point correlation function",
    ", @xmath41 is a function of time and the ` radial ' coordinate @xmath42 only .",
    "the expansion of the universe breaks time translation invariance @xcite , so that we may expect dependence on both @xmath27 and @xmath43 , rather than just on their difference @xmath44 . as we are constructing a causal theory of cosmological perturbations",
    ", we note that causality imposes the constraint @xmath45 so that the two - point correlation function has compact support in @xmath46 . here",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath47 .",
    "the fact that the correlator has compact support in turn means that the fourier transform ( in flat space ) of the correlator is analytic , as are all the integral transforms with which we shall be concerning ourselves .",
    "in particular , we shall be concerned with the power spectra of various functions , defined as the ( fourier or eigenfunction ) coefficient of the equal time two point correlator of the function with its complex conjugate : @xmath48 for an arbitrary function @xmath39 .",
    "implicit in the final equality of ( [ def - ps ] ) is the `` ergodic hypothesis '' which states that one may interchange spatial and ensemble averages . in this case",
    "the assumption of causality may be expressed as @xmath49 in the remainder of this paper we shall frequently suppress the ( equal ) time dependence of the correlators .      for perturbations over a curved frw background , it is usual to employ the helmholtz decomposition using the linearly independent eigenfunctions of the laplacian in polar coordinates @xcite .",
    "we expand all perturbation quantities in terms of the eigenfunctions @xmath50 , which are the scalar ( @xmath51 ) , vector ( @xmath52 ) and tensor ( @xmath53 ) solutions to the helmholtz equation @xmath54 where the eigentensor has @xmath55 suppressed indices ( equal to the rank of the perturbation ) .",
    "the explicit representations of these eigenfunctions are given in appendix a. they are coveniently labeled in terms of a generalised wavenumber @xmath56 , and its normalised equivalent @xmath57 , related to @xmath6 via @xmath58 where @xmath59 and , in flat space , is the fourier wavenumber .",
    "the spectra for flat and open universes ( @xmath60 ) are continuous and complete for @xmath61 . for the open universe",
    ", this means that the normalised scalar eigenvalues are greater than or equal to unity : @xmath62 . for the closed ( @xmath63 ) case , the spectrum is discrete because of the existence of periodic boundary conditons . for scalar perturbations ,",
    "we then have @xmath64 since the @xmath65 modes are pure gauge @xcite .",
    "these spectra yield a set of eigenfunctions that is complete , orthonormal , and sufficient to expand all perturbations produced in a finite region .",
    "the literature ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) contains several comments about the open universe bound @xmath62 , which could be misinterpreted as implying that perturbations can only be generated below the curvature scale .",
    "however , the particle horizon can exceed the curvature scale ( see later ) which means that , in principle , causal perturbations also can be generated on these large lengthscales .",
    "we shall now briefly place these comments in the context of more general eigenfunction decompositions .",
    "if one is attempting to describe the stochastic properties of inflationary cosmologies it may be desirable @xcite to include the eigenfunctions associated with @xmath66 and even @xmath67 , as these may produce effects in the cmb anisotropy patterns  the grischuk - zeldovich effect @xcite .",
    "however , this is only necessary if the assumption that the inflaton field is in the vacuum breaks down for some correlation length much larger than the curvature scale and the effect apparently is not measurable in multi - stage inflation models @xcite .",
    "moreover , these eigenfunctions may be obtained only by analytic continuation and are not orthonormal , nor are they linearly independent of the @xmath68 modes . for square integrable functions",
    " such as those describing the correlators of causal perturbations  the eigenfunctions labelled by @xmath62 are sufficient .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath69 modes are often referred to as the ` subcurvature ' and ` supercurvature modes ' , because their apparent characteristic wavelength ( @xmath70 ) is ( respectively ) smaller or larger than the comoving curvature scale .",
    "however , this nomenclature is misleading : the @xmath62 modes can contain information about effects above the curvature scale , in which case they are very different to their flat space counterparts .",
    "these subcurvature modes are _ not _ therefore confined to subcurvature scales .",
    "they are complete in that they can be used to describe a perturbation on any lengthscale provided it has compact support .",
    "now since the horizon can exceed the curvature scale , this completeness of the @xmath71 modes ensures their sufficiency in describing the correlations of causal perturbations on all lengthscales and at all times .    in an frw universe , the power spectrum ( [ def - ps ] ) of any scalar function of @xmath46 in terms of the scalar eigenfunctions @xmath72 , where we have decomposed the @xmath73 using spherical harmonics ( see ( [ met - decomp ] ) )",
    "this amounts to a transform on the radial coordinate , and a series expansion on the angular part .",
    "in particular we wish to expand the power spectrum of the contracted second derivative of the pseudo - stresses @xmath74 given in ( [ tau - def1 ] ) as @xmath75 where @xmath76 here , in the last expression , we have interchanged integration with respect to @xmath77 and @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , the isotropic @xmath15-mode is given by @xmath78 where we have substituted @xmath79 .",
    "in order to develop intuition as well as to investigate the curved universe superhorizon modes in a helmholtz decomposition , we need to establish the relationship between @xmath80 and the comoving horizon scale @xmath81 .",
    "this is analogous to the flat space result @xmath82 for a fourier - bessel mode with a wavelength of the order of the horizon .",
    "we therefore consider the expansion , in terms of eigenfunctions of the helmholtz equation , of a ` top hat ' window function that vanishes for @xmath83 , and is given by @xmath84 for @xmath85 , where we choose the arbitrary constant @xmath86 .",
    "the fact that @xmath87 is defined in terms of the radial coordinate only means that we may set @xmath88 in the helmholtz decomposition to obtain @xmath89 now , using @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and appealing to ( [ relat-1 ] ) , we have @xmath92 \\ ; , &   k < 0 \\ ; , \\\\",

    "a brief comment on the difference between the hubble radius and the particle horizon is relevant . in practice ,",
    "causal perturbations are usually suppressed beyond the hubble radius because this is roughly the maximum distance over which correlations can be established in one hubble time . however , in principle , they can exist out to the particle horizon , so we must consider this distinction carefully ( e.g. for cosmic strings or , in a more extreme case , for exploding neutrino shells ) . from the friedmann equations ( [ friedeqns ] ) we see that the comoving hubble radius @xmath121 for an open universe , where the density parameter @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "clearly , this implies that the hubble radius is always less than the curvature scale . in inflationary scenarios",
    "the hubble radius is usually the most important quantity and this bound has been used to argue that perturbations with characteristic wavelengths smaller than the curvature scale are well modelled by a flat universe ( see , for example , ref .",

    "explicitly , making the @xmath247 approximation valid on these superhorizon and supercurvature scales , we obtain @xmath249 where the @xmath250 are constant factors .",
    "recalling the equations of motion ( [ tau - cons ] ) for the energy - momentum pseudo - tensor , and that the correlator between two arbitrary functions goes as @xmath146 , we see that on very supercurvature and very superhorizon scales , the correlators behave as : @xmath251    turning now to the other asymptote , we consider the case in which the horizon is very much less than the curvature scale .",
    "then , on superhorizon , and very much subcurvature scales , we regain the familiar @xmath0 power spectrum , up to a constant factor . using the series expansions appropriate for @xmath110 and @xmath252 ,",
    "one easily finds that @xmath253 this has the same form as the superhorizon limit of @xmath254 .",
    "however , one should recall that , while @xmath80 ( for the @xmath255 case ) and @xmath6 ( for @xmath3 ) have similar spectra , their meanings are different in the two spacetimes  see equation ( [ betak - eqn ] ) .",
    "in particular , we have , for the open universe with @xmath110 , two cases : @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "these correspond to mode wavelengths approximately equal to and smaller than the curvature horizon , respectively . in the former case , @xmath258 and @xmath247 so that we have the result ( [ kn0-r1 ] ) once more . in the latter , @xmath259 , for large @xmath80 , in which case we also have that @xmath260 .",
    "then , recalling the normalisation of @xmath6 , we have the local ( subcurvature ) superhorizon limit : @xmath261 recalling the conservation equations ( [ tau - cons ] ) , this means that @xmath262 where @xmath6 is the flat space fourier wavenumber .",
    "having dealt with both the extreme cases of local flatness and curvature domination , there remains the interesting question of the behaviour near the curvature scale .",
    "we therefore would like to understand how the @xmath0 superhorizon behaviour on sub  curvature scales becomes @xmath263 on very super  curvature scales , and the ranges within which these approximations are valid .",
    "away from the asymptotes dealt with above , @xmath264 is a function of the radial coordinate , and therefore is integrated over ( twice ) in equation ( [ int-5 ] ) .",
    "this means that we may only truly understand the effect of the factors in this equation by explicitly calculating the integral , which requires that we specify the pseudo  stresses .",
    "as a first approximation , however , we may proceed to obtain some understanding of the superhorizon behaviour of generic causal perturbations by assuming that the corrections are small enough for us to make the approximation @xmath265 where @xmath266 for some given @xmath242 , and where we have assumed that the correlators of the @xmath213 are well modelled by window functions of the form used in  [ hs - k4sec ] .",
    "this assumption amounts to ignoring long range correlations , since we assume that @xmath267 .",
    "hence this approximation is valid for @xmath149 small , that is , in the very early universe .",
    "we provide surface plots for these pre - factors in figures [ fig - s1][fig - s3 ] , from which we can clearly see how our approximations are valid only for @xmath268 , and break down as we move into the large @xmath242 and large @xmath80 regime , doing so much earlier than in the @xmath3 scenario .",
    "this is a geometric effect due to the fact that the majority of the volume in a hyperbolic space is located near the radial surface , so that a large ` hyper - sphere ' approximates a ` hyper - shell ' .",
    "this effect is most noticible on supercurvature scales .",
    "however , one can calculate that the ratio of hyperbolic volume to surface area rapidly diverges from that for a spherical geometry , beginning at around @xmath269 . on the other hand ,",
    "the steep slope in the prefactor @xmath270 for large @xmath80 and @xmath271 is due to the appearance of a constant ( curvature ) term in the ( repeated ) @xmath272 factors in this prefactor .",

    ", we see that all the pre - factors go as @xmath274 for @xmath3 and as @xmath275 for @xmath276 . along the @xmath242 axis ( @xmath277 ) , all the pre - factors vanish for @xmath3",

    "these show clearly how the @xmath0 behaviour on superhorizon scales is flattened out , for small @xmath80 , by the intrinsic curvature .",
    "we note that this does not mean that we expect the real space correlators to similarly go to a constant on these scales because , of course , they vanish by causality . integrating ( [ ch4-app1 ] ) over all @xmath80 , with the kernel @xmath279 ,",
    "the constant term is suppressed by the measure @xmath280 .",
    "similarly , calculating the variance @xmath281 and breaking the integral over all @xmath80 into supercurvature and subcurvature parts , we see that the second integral is procedurally the same as for the flat space case , for both sub- and superhorizon scales , while the first ( containing the constant power spectrum constribution ) is suppressed by the @xmath282 factor in the measure .      for the closed universe",
    "we have the prefactors determined by @xmath283 the difference between the open and closed universe cases is quantified by the differences between the behaviour of the function ( [ fk>0 - 1 ] ) and that of @xmath264 . to begin with , the eigenspectrum for @xmath80 is discrete , and the lowest non - gauge mode is @xmath284 so that the superhorizon limit @xmath285 can only be attained for @xmath286 .",
    "of course , for @xmath135 we encounter the periodic properties the closed universe : one can not have modes that are both superhorizon and supercurvature .",

    ", we note that @xmath287 , wo we have @xmath288 and we regain the flat space results in a similar fashion to the open universe case .",
    "hence , an analysis similar to that for the open universe shows that we once again find the local limit @xmath289 where @xmath290 for large @xmath80 , with @xmath6 being the flat space fourier wavenumber .",
    "it would be of great physical interest if the consequences of this superhorizon behaviour were within the range of observational searches because it would test ` active ' theories for structure formation , and possibly probe the curvature of the universe .",
    "the cosmic microwave sky may provide the best prospect , however , for the cmb temperature spectrum the superhorizon ` fall - off ' expected on the very largest scales will be confused by cosmic variance .",
    "the most likely signature would be through the cmb polarization spectrum because it represents a primordial snapshot of the universe at recombination which includes about @xmath291 different horizon volumes .",
    "the lack of spatial correlations on scales corresponding to the horizon size at that time ( about @xmath292 ) , and the fall - off in their transformed counterparts , should be observationally testable .",
    "previous analysis of this possibility @xcite , however , has only considered scalar modes , so we comment on the possible impact of vector and tensor modes here .",
    "we leave discussion of the observational imprint of this superhorizon behaviour for a future publication @xcite , concentrating instead on the consistent implementation of initial conditions for numerical simulations .",
    "the decomposition of a tensor perturbation into its scalar , vector and tensor parts is not without its subtleties @xcite , since the projection operators yielding the scalar , vector and tensor parts are not , in general , analytic .",
    "the spatial distribution of the separate geometric parts may therefore be significantly different from the physical distribution of the entire object , so that the decomposed parts of a causal tensor object can manifest acausal features .",
    "the transformed variables will then in turn exhibit non - analytic behaviour @xcite , complicating the analysis of their superhorizon behaviour .",
    "however , causality is merely hidden , and , since the arguments presented in this paper for the ( scalar ) energy density perturbation are ( trivially ) phrased in terms of full tensors , they escape this difficulty .    on the other hand , it is common to employ the assumption of coherence , in which case one regains analyticity @xcite , all the decomposed parts of the perturbation are causal , and one may obtain the power spectra by simple power counting .",
    "this allows us to write down the auto - correlators for both the scalar and the vector parts of the pseudo - tensor @xmath33 , under the influence of energy - momentum conservation .",
    "if we decompose the pseudo - tensor @xmath33 as in ( [ met - decomp ] ) , we may write the energy - momentum equations ( [ tau - cons ] ) as @xmath293   = \\ddot{\\tau}_s \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\tau^{(\\pm 1)}_{it } & = & - 2 { k } [ { k}^2 - 2k ] ^{-1 } \\dot{\\tau}^{(\\pm",

    "note that the correlators in ( [ apcosh ] ) do not diverge as @xmath305 , since @xmath272 tends to @xmath306 in this limit .",
    "the results ( [ apcosh ] ) are more general than one might suppose upon first inspection , as an arbitrary decoherent source may be written as a ` decoherent sum ' of coherent sources , each of which will then be amenable to the above arguments @xcite .",
    "moreover , we believe that it is plausible to expect approximate coherence on the very largest scales , since the eigenfunctions used to diagonalise the ` decoherent sum ' are likely to either all tend to white noise on these scales , or to be dominated by just one element in the sum  see also ref .",
    "this notion has been ventured before as an hypothesis @xcite for scaling sources , and is supported by both numerical results @xcite , and by the observation that , for causal sources , modes with wavelengths much larger than the horizon can not be significantly out of phase with one another .",
    "we shall consider this point in more detail elsewhere @xcite .      finally , we wish to propose a set of initial conditions which would find useful application in numerical simulations of causal perturbation models , such as cosmic defects .",
    "we shall assume , as is usual , that we are dealing primarily with the evolution of transformed quantities . by considered an instantaneous phase transition early in the universe as a first approximation to a model for cosmic defects `` switching on '' , and employing a gauge in which constant energy and constant time surfaces coincide ,",
    "matching conditions can be used to show that there exists an entire class of objects which are continuous across the transition and are related by gauge transformation to our pseudo - tensor components . in a previous paper ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we used the notion of compensation together with a particular gauge specification to remove this redundancy such that the @xmath294 ( pseudo - energy ) and @xmath307 ( divergenceless vector ) components of our generalized pseudo - tensor have this property : @xmath308_{\\pm } = 0 \\ ; , \\hspace{15 mm } [ \\tau_v^{\\pm 1}]_{\\pm } = 0 \\ , .",
    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while we emphasise that this matching depends on a special gauge choice , it is one which should be widely applicable in many physical situations , for example , a defect - forming transition @xcite .    for a universe which was unperturbed ( and hence homogeneous and isotropic ) prior to the transition",
    ", we may then take @xmath309 as natural initial conditions .",
    "this result is consistent on all scales and is especially appropriate for suppressed superhorizon modes .",
    "the results of  [ sec - shiso ] confirm this conclusion for the density perturbation tracked by @xmath294 , and the previous section argues that this conclusion may be extended also to the ` induced vector ' mode @xmath295 and the true vector modes @xmath310 .",
    "hence , if one wishes to set initial conditions for perturbations initially outside the horizon , one may consistently set both the pseudo - energy @xmath311 and the pseudo - momentum @xmath312 to zero .",
    "if one wishes to include long wavelength modes that are affected by curvature , then one can proceed in a similar fashion .",
    "although the transformed correlators become constant on these scales , at early times they are sufficiently outside the horizon for their amplitude to be strongly suppressed .",
    "therefore , the matching conditions we propose as initial conditions will also be applicable and self - consistent for a curved universe .",
