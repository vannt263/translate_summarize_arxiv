    "the superconducting current density @xmath6 is a unique feature of a superconducting material .",

    "is given by the classical ginzburg - landau ( gl ) expression @xmath14 , where @xmath15 = @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the depairing current at zero temperature .",
    "early work on determining @xmath0 in sn microbridges can be found in @xcite .",
    "the gl approach becomes invalid at lower temperatures , since the conditions @xmath18@xmath19 for clean limit superconductors ( @xmath20 is ginzburg - landau parameter ) , or @xmath21@xmath22 for dirty limit superconductors , are no longer fulfilled .",
    "a more complete and quantitative theory , valid for all temperatures and arbitrary mean free path , was developed by kupriyanov and lukichev ( kl ) , who obtained the numerical solution of the eilenberger equations for a superconductor carrying a current , with the velocity of the cooper - pairs proportional to a phase gradient of the superconducting order parameter @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "notably , their theory gives the same expression for @xmath0(t ) as gl theory for the temperature region close to t@xmath24 and also yields the correct expressions for @xmath0(0 ) in terms of the materials constants .",
    "+ the amount of theoretical work done on depairing currents in conventional superconductors contrasts sharply with a lack of experimental observations .",
    "a major issue here is the requirement with respect to sample dimensions . in principle",
    ", the sample width should not be larger than both the penetration depth @xmath2 , and the coherence length @xmath1 .",
    "the first condition is needed to avoid current piling up at the edges , because of the meissner effect @xcite . for a superconducting film @xmath2",
    "is given by @xmath25 , ( d@xmath26 ) where @xmath27 is the bulk london penetration depth , d@xmath11 is film thickness , and the magnetic field is taken perpendicular to the film plane . at low temperatures in case of dirty superconductors it becomes @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the bcs coherence length , and @xmath30 is the elastic mean free path . a typical value of @xmath27 for instance for polycrystalline nb is 50  nm ; for amorphous materials such as a - mo@xmath4ge@xmath5 , which will also be discussed below , @xmath27 is much larger , of the order of 0.5  @xmath31 m .",
    "the condition on @xmath1 must be fulfilled when vortex nucleation and flow is to be prevented , which cause dissipation in sample before the @xmath0 is reached .",
    "exact calculations made by likharev @xcite show that the smallest sample width below which no vortex can appear equals 4.4@xmath32 , where @xmath32 is the ginzburg - landau coherence length given by @xmath32 = 0.85  @xmath33 , with @xmath34 = @xmath35 .",
    "typical values of @xmath34 for our nb and mo@xmath4ge@xmath5 are 12  nm ( because of the small mean free path ) and 5  nm , respectively .",
    "the only case where both conditions can be implemented is a thin aluminum film shaped in a form of a narrow ( about 1@xmath31 m ) bridge .",
    "the bcs coherence length for al is of the order of 1.5 @xmath31 m , while the penetration depth can be increased to a similar value by decreasing the film thickness .",
    "@xcite showed that for such system the experimental values of the depairing current density were in excellent agreement with kl theory for temperatures down to 0.2@xmath15 . in case of nb and mo@xmath4ge@xmath5 films",
    "one would have to go to a bridge width not larger than 30  nm in order to prevent vortex appearance .",
    "+ however , vortex motion also has an advantage , since it will homogenize the current distribution @xcite .",
    "the main problem then in determining @xmath0 is to avoid sample heating , either by dissipation due to vortex motion , or e.g. to heating in the contacts due to the relatively large currents . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the undesired sample heating can be avoided by using a pulsed current method .",
    "we use different superconductors , with widely different values of @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , we use nb with low @xmath36 and also relatively low specific resistance @xmath3 ( around 7  @xmath37 cm ) and amorphous ( a-)mo@xmath4ge@xmath5 with large @xmath36 and a large @xmath38 160  @xmath37 cm .",
    "especially the large @xmath3 easily leads to dissipation in the neighborhood of the transition to the normal metal state .",
    "films of different thicknesses were patterned into bridges of different width w@xmath11 .",
    "the experimental values we obtain for the depairing current density @xmath0(t ) are in very good agreement with the kl calculations , assuming that the current distribution across the samples is perfectly homogeneous .",

    "films of a - mo@xmath4ge@xmath5 were deposited in a rf - diode sputtering system with a background pressure of 10@xmath42 mbar in an ar pressure of 8@xmath4010@xmath41 mbar .",
    "sputtering rates for nb and a - mo@xmath4ge@xmath5 were 0.8  / s and 1.2  / s respectively .",
    "both materials were grown on si ( 100 ) substrates .",
    "the thickness of the films was determined during the deposition by a crystal thickness monitor , which was calibrated by low angle x - ray diffraction measurements and rutherford backscattering . for the depairing current experiments ,",
    "samples were structured in the shape of strips of different cross - section by e - beam lithography and ar - ion etching .",
    "the structure included the contacts . in the case of a - mo@xmath4ge@xmath5 , samples were water - cooled during deposition and liquid nitrogen - cooled during etching , in order to prevent undesirable film crystallization .        the typical geometry of the samples is shown in fig .  1 . in all cases",

    "for determination of the critical current value @xmath56 at different temperatures a pulsed current method was used , in which current pulses with a growing amplitude were sent through the sample .",

    "basically , we find quite good agreement for all sample widths . in the case of nb",
    ", the most serious deviation is found for the 5  @xmath31 m bridge , which is presumably due to contact heating as a result of the larger current .",
    "it is interesting to note that the extrapolated values are the same as found by geers _",
    "@xcite who used continuous currents and larger bridge widths .",
    "the differences are in the extent of the gl - regime , which was only found down to @xmath15  = 0.93 in the earlier experiments , and also in the temperature dependence below the gl regime . there ,",
    "the temperature dependence is described by the full kl - calculation , which was also performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a single superconducting film ,",
    "the results for nb are shown in fig .  5 by the solid line . the smallest sample ( d=20 nm , w=1  @xmath31",
    "m ) follows the kl theoretical curve down to @xmath15 = 0.2 without a significant deviations .",
    "wider bridges show a suppression of @xmath82 with respect to the calculated value , again in agreement with earlier results @xcite .",
    "presumably , sample heating via contacts and vortex flow occurs even for the short time of a current pulse .",

    "the black solid and dashed lines indicate kl and gl results respectively.,width=264 ]    circumstances can be somewhat less favorable , however , as shown by the measurements on a - mo@xmath4ge@xmath5 .",
    "these were performed only for a film thickness of 64 nm . in the gl regime",
    "the difference between measured and calculated values of @xmath63 is somewhat larger than for nb ( see table 1 ) , with the measured values larger than the calculated ones . it will be clear that this can not be due to pile - up of current at the samples edges , which would yield the opposite effect",
    "moreover , for amorphous materials this should be less of a problem , since the penetration depths are very large and actually of the order of the smallest bridge width .",
    "the difficulty rather lies in the correct determination of @xmath82 close to @xmath60 , with more scatter in the individual points .",
    "one reason for this may be the very low vortex pinning which is characteristic of amorphous materials @xcite .",
    "another may be that the processing of the film during the structuring process may lead to changes in the material .",
    "for instance , the specific resistance we find for the bridges is about 10  % lower than for wider structures @xcite . also , thinner films showed increasing @xmath3 and decreasing @xmath60 , which in this thickness regime can not be well explained by the onset of localization effects @xcite .",
    "since amorphous materials are very sensitive to recrystallization , this may be playing a role .",
    "still , the difference between @xmath63 and @xmath17 is only 20  % , which may still be considered very good .",
    "for the temperature dependence ( fig .",
    "6 ) the result is also similar to nb . for the smallest bridge ,",
    "the experimental curve shows good agreement with the theoretical prediction , while for wider bridges the values remain too low .",
    "+ in summary , we have shown that measurements of depairing currents in conventional type - ii superconductors with cross - section larger than their characteristic lengths @xmath1 and @xmath2 is well possible by using a pulsed current method . using two different superconductors with quite different values of their depairing current , we found good agreement between experiments and theory with respect to both the absolute values and the temperature dependence , over essentially the full range of temperatures .",
    "such an unambiguous determination of a quantity which directly measures the superconducting order parameter should also find use in problems posed by hybrid systems ; in particular , it will be the correct quantity to gauge the effects of suppression of superconductivity by the injection of ( spin - polarized ) quasiparticles .",
