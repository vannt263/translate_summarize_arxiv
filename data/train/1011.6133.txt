    "there are @xmath103 such graphs on @xmath104 vertices , @xmath105 on @xmath106 vertices and @xmath107 on @xmath108 vertices .",
    "since the connected exceptional graphs with smallest eigenvalue @xmath63 have subgraphs isomorphic to one of such graphs as a star complement for @xmath63 , we can obtain the complete list of exceptional graphs satisfying @xmath92 from @xmath102 such graphs . by comupter",

    "[ lm:003 ] let @xmath0 be a connected exceptional graph satisfying @xmath92 .",

    "this means that @xmath0 has maximum degree at most three and hence as it has spectral radius three , it must be three - regular .",
    "so @xmath114 . if @xmath0 contains an induced quadrangle , then again , by perron - frobenius theorem , @xmath0 must be this quadrangle , a contradiction . by solving equations ( [ eq : a - m-0])-([eq : a - m-3 ] ) with @xmath114 and @xmath111",

    "hence @xmath120 .",
    "second , we show that @xmath125 . if @xmath111 , then @xmath112 by lemma [ lm:003 ] .",
    "so we assume that @xmath126 .",

    "hence we have @xmath134 .    by calculating [ equation ( [ eq : a - m-3 ] ) ] @xmath135 [ equation ( [ eq : a - m-1 ] ) ] , we obtain @xmath136 , that is , @xmath137 . by calculating [ equation ( [ eq : a - m-3 ] ) ] @xmath135 @xmath138 [ equation ( [ eq : a - m-1 ] ) ] , we obtain @xmath139 , that is , @xmath140 .",
