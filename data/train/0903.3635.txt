    "the transport dynamics induced by _ asymmetries _ of systems is an important paradigm in physics , dating back to feynman s thought - experiment of a mechanical ratchet at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the point of feynman s analysis was to demonstrate that in thermal equilibrium , the ratchet can not be used to `` rectify '' thermal fluctuations to do useful work , because brownian motion of the ratchet mechanism itself causes it to intermittently fail in such a way as to prevent steady - state motion against a constant force .",
    "however , in _ nonequilibrium _ situations  such as a simple temperature difference  the asymmetry of a system _ can _ induce steady - state transport , and of course do work .",
    "recently , the study of more general `` ratchets , '' where thermal fluctuations or time - dependent forces couple with periodic asymmetric potentials to produce steady - state directed motion @xcite , has become of broad interest .",
    "ratchet systems in the form of molecular and brownian motors @xcite are of particular interest in understanding how controlled motion is effected in spite of thermal fluctuations , especially at the nanoscale , where such fluctuations tend to be large .",
    "ratchets have also recently been studied in the context of the laser - cooling of atoms in asymmetric optical - lattice potentials @xcite .",
    "a related problem of asymmetric transport occurs for particles in the presence of asymmetric barriers .",
    "for example , asymmetric diffusion occurs in transport across membranes .",
    "a recent experiment demonstrated that asymmetric transport can be caused by an asymmetry in the shape of the membrane pores , provided that a sufficiently wide range of particle sizes is present @xcite . in this case",
    ", larger particles can clog the pores ( but only from one side ) , preventing smaller particles from diffusing through the membrane in one direction . in atom optics , it is possible to realize similar `` one - way barriers '' or `` atom diodes , '' as proposed independently by raizen _",
    "_ @xcite and ruschhaupt and muga @xcite in slightly different contexts ( with a number of subsequent refinements in the general design @xcite ) .",
    "these optical one - way barriers for cold atoms are _ asymmetric _ optical potentials in the sense that atoms experience a different potential depending on the direction of incidence : atoms incident from one side reflect from the barrier , while atoms incident from the other side transmit through it . unlike the above membrane",
    ", however , this one - way action is entirely a single - particle effect , relying on optical potentials that change depending on the internal state of the atom .",
    "note that in a closely related proposal , a combination of coherent and incoherent processes conspires to allow transport of particles from one reservoir to another , but not in the reverse direction @xcite .",
    "a common theme among all the systems mentioned above is that _ dissipation _ is required to produce asymmetric transport .",
    "ratchets , for example , typically involve overdamped motion and thus heavy dissipation . however , an interesting question is , how _ little _ dissipation is required to produce a significant asymmetry in the transport ?",
    "the most straightforward answer for the optical one - way barrier here is that one photon must be spontaneously scattered per particle , since the action of the one - way barrier depends on an irreversible change in the internal state of the atom .",
    "( presumably , though , one can construct more complicated schemes that require even less dissipation ; we will show below that our one - way barrier dissipates more entropy than is required by the second law of thermodynamics . )",
    "this question is particularly relevant in the atom - optical case , since one of the main motivations in realizing one - way barriers for atoms is in developing new laser - cooling methods for atoms @xcite .",
    "the idea here is that the one - way barrier can force the accumulation of atoms into a volume much smaller than the original container .",
    "the phase - space density of the atomic vapor increases if the effect of the volume compression outweighs any heating effects of the barrier .",
    "( cooling can then be straightforwardly effected via adiabatic expansion ; the most important step in terms of controlling an atomic vapor is reducing the phase - space volume . )",
    "phase - space compression with one - way barriers has recently been demonstrated with rubidium atoms @xcite . the best increase in phase - space density achieved so far is a factor of @xmath1 above the initial conditions of a vapor in a magnetic trap @xcite .",
    "though standard laser - cooling techniques such as doppler cooling are now well established @xcite , they generally rely on the existence of a cycling optical transition : atoms falling into `` dark states '' decouple from the cooling lasers .",
    "since the irreversible action of a one - way barrier relies in principle only on the scattering of a single photon , laser - cooling techniques based on one - way barriers may help circumvent problems with dark states and enable laser cooling of molecules @xcite and the many atoms for which standard laser - cooling methods are ineffective .",
    "another , more fundamental , motivation for studying the one - way barrier comes from its connection to maxwell s demon @xcite . in this thought - experiment",
    ", the demon manipulates a trapdoor in a wall dividing a container of gas .",
    "the demon could use the trapdoor as a one - way barrier to reduce the space occupied by the atoms without performing any work , in an apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "( maxwell s original demon used the trapdoor to separate hot and cold atoms to achieve a temperature gradient , but the reduction of entropy is the essence of the thought - experiment . ) one can think about the resolution to this `` paradox '' in a number of ways @xcite , but the key issue is that the demon must perform measurements on the system , gaining the information needed to perform feedback via the trapdoor .",
    "the entropy decrease of the atoms is balanced by an _ increase _ in the entropy of the demon s memory due to the accumulated information .",
    "this can not continue indefinitely in a cyclic process unless the demon s memory is reset , or `` erased . ''",
    "the erasure requires transferring entropy to the environment , in accordance with the second law .",
    "our experiment effectively consists of only a single thermodynamic cycle , and so a cyclic erasure is not strictly necessary .",
    "the spontaneous scattering of photons from the barrier laser light in our experiment both acts as an effective position measurement on each atom and carries away sufficient entropy to compensate for entropy lost in the reduction in phase - space volume .",
    "this work builds on our previous study of an all - optical realization of a one - way barrier for rubidium atoms @xcite .",
    "here we perform a detailed study of the dynamics of cold atoms crossing the one - way barrier .",
    "we study how various aspects of the barrier configuration contribute to its operation , and we discuss the key elements of optimizing the robustness and performance of the barrier .",
    "we also compare our data to simulations that treat the center - of - mass motion of the atoms classically , and obtain good agreement .",
    "finally , we examine in some detail the entropic aspects of phase - space compression with the one - way barrier .",

    "[ fig : potential ] ]    the optical one - way barrier is the principal feature of our experimental setup ( fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalsetup ] ) , comprising two focused gaussian laser beams .",
    "the one - way barrier scheme exploits the hyperfine ground - state structure of @xmath0 to create an asymmetry that allows atoms to transmit through the barrier when traveling in one direction , but reflects them when traveling in the other .",
    "the main barrier beam is tuned between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath0 hyperfine transitions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hfs ] .",
    "thus the detuning @xmath8 of the barrier - beam frequency @xmath9 with respect to the atomic resonance @xmath10 has opposite signs for atoms in the two hyperfine ground levels .",
    "this results in the main barrier beam presenting an _ attractive _ potential to atoms in the @xmath3 ground state and a _ repulsive _ potential to atoms in the @xmath4 ground state , because the optical dipole potential is inversely proportional to the detuning @xmath11 .",
    "these two potentials are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] . to create the asymmetry",
    ", we introduce a second beam , the repumping barrier beam , that is resonant with the @xmath5 repumping transition , displaced from the main barrier beam as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalsetup ] .",
    "if all atoms start in the transmitting ( @xmath3 ) ground state , they can pass through the main barrier beam until they pass through the repumping barrier beam , at which point they will be pumped to the reflecting ( @xmath4 ) ground state .",
    "the atoms will then see the main barrier beam as a potential barrier and will remain trapped on that side of the one - way barrier .",
    "we choose to have the repumping barrier beam on the right - hand side of the main barrier beam , which makes that side the reflecting side of the barrier , and the left - hand side the transmitting side .",
    "we initially cool and trap the @xmath0 atoms in a standard six - beam magneto - optic trap ( mot ) @xcite , loaded from a cold atomic beam produced by a pyramid mot @xcite . after a secondary polarization - gradient cooling stage with reduced intensity and increased detuning of the trapping beam , we have about @xmath12 atoms at about @xmath13 in an ultra - high vacuum of @xmath14 .",
    "the position of the mot can be shifted several millimeters in each coordinate using magnetic bias fields .    after cooling we load the atoms into a far - detuned optical dipole trap produced by a @xmath15 yb : fiber laser .",
    "the laser emits a collimated , multiple - longitudinal - mode , unpolarized , nearly gaussian beam with a @xmath16 @xmath17 beam radius .",
    "we operate this laser so that the total power inside the vacuum chamber is @xmath18 .",
    "we focus the beam with a single @xmath19 focal length plano - convex lens , producing a @xmath20 waist ( @xmath17 intensity radius ) and a @xmath21 rayleigh length . for @xmath0 atoms in either hyperfine ground state ,",
    "this beam yields a nearly conservative potential well with a maximum potential depth of @xmath22 .",
    "this dipole trap has longitudinal and transverse harmonic frequencies of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ( near the trap center ) , a @xmath25 lifetime of @xmath26 , and a maximum scattering rate of only @xmath27 .",
    "atoms are typically loaded in the anharmonic region of the trap , so that the atomic motion dephases and has a different period ( @xmath28 ) than the harmonic frequency suggests ( angular momentum adds to this effect ; see appendix [ app : ang_mom ] ) .",
    "the two one - way barrier beams are nearly parallel asymmetric gaussian beams with a variable separation .",
    "their foci nearly coincide with the focus of the dipole - trap beam , intersecting it at about @xmath29 from the perpendicular to the beam axis ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalsetup ] ) .",
    "the main [ repumping ] barrier beam has a waist of @xmath30 [ @xmath31 along the dipole - trap axis and @xmath32 [ @xmath33 perpendicular to the dipole - trap axis .",
    "we control the power of the repumping barrier beam with an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "we measure the separation of the two beams on a beam profiler that has a resolution of @xmath34 .",
    "we take pictures of each beam profile at many locations along the beam axis near the focus , thus making it possible to accurately locate the axial position of the focus despite the fact the beam waists are on the same order of magnitude as the camera resolution . using this setup",
    ", we determine the separation of the beams ( on the order of ten microns ) with an error on the order of a micron .",
    "we image the atoms by illuminating them with a @xmath35 pulse of light resonant with the @xmath36 mot trapping transition .",
    "this absorption - imaging beam is nearly perpendicular to the dipole - trap beam , and is detected by a charge - coupled - device ( ccd ) camera , which images the shadow left by the atoms that scatter light out of the beam .",
    "we image atoms in the @xmath3 ground state ( which do not scatter the mot trapping light ) by turning the mot repumping beams on slightly before and throughout the imaging pulse , ensuring that all atoms are in the @xmath4 ground state .",
    "the short image pulse is ideal for getting accurate spatial imaging , since the atoms can not move much during that time . to reduce systematic errors due to interference fringes in the images ,",
    "we subtract background offsets ( as computed from the edge regions of the images ) on a per - column basis and then integrate each column to form distributions ( such as the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] ) .",
    "the spatial resolution is @xmath37 as set by the ccd pixel spacing , but the distributions are smoothed slightly for visual clarity .",
    "the total number of trapped atoms drifted slowly over time , so we often rescaled atom distributions in order to aid comparison of different data sets .",
    "our `` canonical '' data are taken as follows .",
    "we load the dipole trap with the mot centered on the dipole - beam axis @xmath38 away from the dipole - trap focus for @xmath39 , trapping about @xmath40 atoms ( measured by imaging the resonance fluorescence from the mot light on a ccd camera ) at @xmath41 , with a peak one - dimensional atom density of around @xmath42 ( on the order of @xmath43 ) .",
    "longer load times trap more atoms , but the atoms spread throughout the trap during loading .",
    "we used a relatively short loading time to keep the atoms localized . to allow atoms from the mot that are not trapped in the dipole trap to fall away ,",
    "we extinguish the mot beams and wait approximately @xmath44 ( about half an oscillation period ) after loading atoms into the dipole beam but before turning the barrier beams on . during this half - period delay ,",
    "atoms spread in the dipole trap , reducing their apparent mean displacement from the dipole - trap focus .",
    "for example , the center of the atomic distribution for the normal @xmath45 mean starting offset of the atoms is only @xmath46 away from the dipole - trap focus after the half - period delay .",
    "henceforth , we will quote the offset of the center of the atomic distribution after this delay .    during the half - period delay after loading atoms into the dipole trap",
    ", we optically pump the loaded atoms to the @xmath3 ground state by extinguishing the mot repumping beams and then leaving the mot trapping beams ( red - detuned by @xmath47 ) on for another @xmath48 .",
    "we verified that this pumps virtually all the atoms to the @xmath3 ground state by using absorption imaging without the mot repumping beams .",
    "after the half - period delay , we turn on the barrier beams ( we designate this time as @xmath49 ) , allow the system to evolve for some time ranging from a few milliseconds to as long as a few seconds , and then image the atoms .",
    "we load atoms to either side of the barrier beams , and label data as either `` transmitting side '' or `` reflecting side , '' based on which side of the barrier beams the atoms were on at @xmath49 ( when the barrier beams are turned on ) . because we wait a half - period between loading the atoms and @xmath49 , atoms are actually loaded on the _ opposite _ side of the barrier beams with respect to their `` starting '' location .",
    "the main barrier beam was normally @xmath50 to the left ( as seen by the camera ) of the repumping barrier beam , making the left - hand ( right - hand ) side of the barrier beam the transmitting ( reflecting ) side .",
    "we normally ran the main barrier beam with @xmath51 of power ( inside the vacuum chamber ) , resonant with the @xmath52 @xmath53 crossover dip in the rubidium saturated - absorption spectrum , which is @xmath54 blue of the @xmath0 mot trapping transition .",
    "we normally ran the repumping barrier beam at @xmath55 ( inside the vacuum chamber ) , and always stabilized it to the @xmath0 @xmath5 mot repumping transition .",
    "we use two different conventions when reporting laser detunings .",
    "when we wish to give the absolute frequency of a laser , we report the detuning as the difference between the laser frequency and the @xmath56 @xmath0 mot transition .",
    "however , for computing optical potentials and scattering rates , we need to account for the presence of four separate excited states , and the hyperfine splitting between these states is not negligible . for these purposes , we compute and report an effective detuning . the dipole potential for each two - level transition is proportional to the squared dipole matrix element for the transition , and inversely proportional to the detuning . in order to keep a two - level - atom approximation , we average over the different excited states , using the correct dipole matrix elements and energy shifts , to obtain an effective two - level detuning . for example , in our canonical setup ,",
    "our main barrier beam is tuned @xmath54 to the blue of the @xmath36 @xmath0 mot transition . when we compute an optical potential using all four excited states in the @xmath2 manifold to obtain an effective two - level - atom detuning that gets the same answer , we find @xmath57 for atoms in the @xmath4 ground state , and @xmath58 for atoms in the @xmath3 ground state . for computing scattering rates , we need to average squared dipole matrix elements divided by the square of the detuning",
    ". for the detunings we used , effective two - level detunings for both optical potentials and scattering rates differed by less than the accuracies quoted here .",
    "one common variation from our canonical setup was the `` @xmath4 setup . '' for these data , during the half - period while we waited for mot atoms to fall away , we chose to optically pump the atoms into the @xmath4 ground state by flashing the mot repumping beam without the mot trapping beam . unless otherwise specified , we optically pumped atoms into the @xmath3 ground state .",
    "another variation we used was the `` filled trap . '' for these experiments we loaded the atoms to the left - hand side of the barrier beams for @xmath59 and waited @xmath60 before turning the barrier beams on , loading about @xmath61 atoms at @xmath62 . these times are several times the longitudinal trap period , and so resulted in a fairly even distribution of atoms throughout the dipole trap .",
    "we used the same method described above to ensure all atoms were pumped into the @xmath3 ground state for these experiments .    unless otherwise noted , the main barrier beam was linearly polarized perpendicular to the dipole - trap beam axis , and the repumping barrier beam",
    "was linearly polarized parallel to the dipole - trap beam axis .",
    "we found that beam polarization was not a critical factor in the barrier operation .",
    "repetitions . [ fig : compression ] ]    the main results for the one - way barrier are presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : waterfall ] , which shows the atomic evolution in response to the one - way barrier . to elucidate the effects of the one - way barrier , fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall](a ) shows the evolution of the atoms in the dipole trap in the absence of the barrier .",
    "as expected , the atoms oscillate back and forth about the trap center with some breakup of the atomic cloud evident at later times due to the anharmonicity of the trapping potential and the spread in angular momentum of atoms orbiting the dipole - trap axis .",
    "figure [ fig : waterfall](b ) shows the dynamics of the atoms in the presence of the one - way barrier , which is located at the origin .",
    "the repumping barrier beam is positioned to the right of the main barrier beam in the columns so that the atoms , initially released from the left - hand side of the barrier , will interact first with the main barrier beam .",
    "the repumping barrier beam defines the reflecting side of the barrier , which makes the left side the transmitting side .",
    "the atoms , which are initially prepared in the @xmath3 transmitting state , pass through the main barrier beam to the right - hand side of the barrier .",
    "there the atoms interact with the repumping barrier beam , which optically pumps them to the @xmath4 reflecting state . upon their return ,",
    "the atoms are effectively trapped on the right - hand side of the barrier as they repeatedly reflect from the barrier .    when the atoms start on the reflecting side of the barrier , as in fig .  [",
    "fig : waterfall](d ) , they also remain trapped to the right of the barrier .",
    "this holds true regardless of the initial state of the atoms ; atoms starting in the @xmath4 reflecting state are expected to reflect from the main barrier beam , while atoms starting in the @xmath3 transmitting state will first encounter the repumping barrier beam , which will optically pump them to the @xmath4 reflecting state before they reach the main barrier beam .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig : waterfall](d ) show the evolution for atoms initially in the @xmath3 transmitting state , and we observe similarly good reflections for atoms starting in the @xmath4 reflecting state .",
    "figure [ fig : waterfall](c ) reveals what happens when atoms start on the left - hand ( transmitting ) side of the barrier in the @xmath4 ( reflecting ) state .",
    "initially the atoms reflect from the barrier as expected , but then the atoms gradually pass through the barrier and become trapped on the right - hand side .",
    "this phenomenon is a direct result of choosing the main - barrier - beam frequency to be more nearly resonant with the @xmath63 transition than the @xmath6 transition .",
    "though the main barrier beam reflects many atoms during the initial encounter , this interaction will also change the state of many of these atoms from the @xmath4 reflecting state to the @xmath3 transmitting state .",
    "when these atoms encounter the main barrier beam the second time , they will transmit through , while atoms that did not change state on the first reflection will eventually change their state upon subsequent reflections .",
    "this results in a net accumulation of atoms on the right - hand side of the barrier despite the atoms being initially in the `` wrong '' ( @xmath4 reflecting ) state .",
    "the one - way barrier functions almost equally well for atoms on either side of the barrier and for atoms in either state .    as a further test of the utility of the one - way barrier",
    ", we activated the barrier after a `` filled - trap '' load of the dipole trap , which resulted in a symmetric and relatively uniform initial distribution of atoms , all in the @xmath3 ( transmitting ) ground state .",
    "this experiment also had a lower barrier - beam power of @xmath64 , chosen to reduce heating without much harm to the function of the barrier . in this",
    "scheme atoms on the left - hand side of the barrier gradually transmit to the right - hand side , while atoms on the right - hand side remain there .",
    "the results for this test are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall](e ) , where many of the atoms that start to the left of the barrier eventually transmit to the right - hand side . figure [ fig : compression ] is generated from the same data , and shows the populations on each side of the barrier as a function of time .",
    "here it is easier to see that atoms really are being transferred from the left - hand side of the barrier to the right - hand side , in the manner of maxwell s demon .      ]",
    "the main technical challenge associated with implementing the one - way barrier lies in the limited detunings afforded by the @xmath65 ground - state hyperfine splitting of @xmath0 . detuning the main barrier beam halfway in between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 ground states",
    "seems an obvious choice ; however , this is still near enough to the @xmath6 resonance to optically pump a portion of the atoms ( initially in the @xmath3 transmitting state ) to the @xmath4 reflecting state while they are traversing the barrier beam .",
    "this results in a sudden increase in potential energy , greatly increasing the total energy of the atom .",
    "the heating associated with this transition is on the order of the barrier height , which greatly decreases the effectiveness of the barrier .",
    "this heating mechanism informed our choice of main - barrier - beam detuning , in which the main barrier beam is more nearly resonant with the @xmath7 transition , with a @xmath54 detuning from the @xmath66 mot trapping transition . with this detuning , atoms in the @xmath3 ground state scatter few photons , so heating during transmission is minimized .",
    "scattering during reflection is more probable because the main barrier beam is closer to the resonances available to atoms in the @xmath4 ground state .",
    "however , when atoms change state during reflection , their potential energy is _ decreased _ , which cools them . those atoms are then free to transmit , and are still cool enough for the barrier to trap them when they return to the reflecting side .",
    "data collected to probe the effects of different main - barrier - beam detunings are presented and analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : robustness ] , where we see that a more symmetric detuning does not function as well as this asymmetric detuning .    for our canonical setup , which uses",
    "the detuning described above , we expect @xmath67 scattering events on a single transmission and @xmath68 scattering events on a single reflection , ignoring state changes and any scattering from the repumping barrier beam ( see appendix [ app : analytic ] ) .",
    "we also ran simulations ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] for more details ) that account for state changes , heating , and scattering from the repumping barrier beam .",
    "these simulations found slightly higher values of @xmath69 scattering events for transmission and @xmath70 scattering events for a single reflection .",
    "in particular , note that even though the main barrier beam is detuned by more than half of the hyperfine ground - state splitting for transmitting atoms , scattering is not negligible .    losses in general in this setup seem to be mainly due to light - assisted collisions ( discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] ) facilitated by the barrier beams during reflection and transmission .",
    "light - assisted collisions include fine - structure - changing collisions @xcite , hyperfine - changing collisions @xcite , photoassociation @xcite , and radiative escape @xcite .",
    "we believe that , for our barrier beam , the dominant loss mechanism is radiative escape @xcite , although all can be modeled as density - dependent loss mechanisms . in radiative",
    "escape , an atom is promoted to an excited state by one of the barrier beams . while excited , the atom is much more polarizable and interacts more strongly with neighboring atoms . before decaying",
    ", the atom accelerates toward a neighboring atom .",
    "once the atom has decayed back to the ground state , the atoms cease interacting , but keep their kinetic energy .",
    "this kinetic energy is often enough to eject both atoms from the trap .",
    "initial trap lifetimes range from @xmath71 to @xmath72 on the right - hand ( reflecting ) side of the barrier depending on the temperature of the atoms .",
    "the fitted exponential lifetimes are markedly larger ( approaching @xmath73 to @xmath74 ) in the late - time tails of the population - decay curves .",
    "the scattering rates are not too problematic in our setup , as the lifetimes indicate .",
    "however , the lifetimes could be improved considerably if we could reduce the scattering rate by one or two orders of magnitude , so that the average number of scattering events on transmission and reflection was well below unity .",
    "as shown in appendix [ app : analytic ] , the scattering rate depends mostly on the barrier height , atomic speed , and the ratio of the linewidth to the detuning . once the barrier is high enough to easily trap atoms , scattering during reflection is only weakly dependent on barrier height .",
    "scaling down the atomic velocities limits the utility of the barrier as a cooling mechanism , so increasing the detuning is perhaps the best variable to use in reducing scattering . a large increase in detuning",
    "could be achieved if the main barrier beam used a transition with a substantially different frequency than any available to the reflecting state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : four - level ] ) .",
    "this would allow the main barrier beam to be far - detuned from the reflecting - to - excited state transition , and still several orders of magnitude further detuned from the transmitting - to - intermediate state transition .",
    "atoms in the transmitting state would thus be largely unaffected by the main barrier beam because of the very large detuning , but could still be pumped to the reflecting ground state by the repumping beam . if necessary , a third laser beam detuned from the transmitting - to - intermediate state could be used to cancel any shifts of the transmitting state by the main barrier beam .",
    "this would circumvent the ground - state - splitting limitation and lead to perhaps orders of magnitude less scattering .    as a more specific example",
    ", we could use @xmath75 , with the true ground state ( @xmath76 ) as the transmitting state and the metastable state ( @xmath77 ) as the reflecting state . for the intermediate and excited states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : four - level ] , we could use @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively . with these states ,",
    "the main - barrier - beam transition is almost @xmath80 red of the repumping - barrier - beam frequency and has a linewidth comparable to the @xmath0 @xmath2 transitions .",
    "this would allow the main barrier beam to be detuned much further than the @xmath0 ground - state splitting and still be many nanometers detuned from the repumping - barrier - beam transition .",
    "this could reduce scattering during reflection by multiple orders of magnitude and reduce scattering during transmission to negligible levels .",
    "the repumping decays presented here are slow ( millisecond time scales ) and involve other states that may decay to either the reflecting state or back to the transmitting state , but all routes back to the transmitting state are short compared with the reflecting state lifetime .",
    "the long repumping time could be corrected for by allowing the repumping barrier beam to fill the entire trapping side of the barrier , allowing for more interaction time .",
    "to investigate the robustness of the one - way barrier , we varied four key parameters in the experiment :    1 .   the separation between the main barrier beam and the repumping barrier beam , from @xmath81 to @xmath82 ; 2 .   the initial displacement of the atoms ( this represents an effective change in barrier height ) , from @xmath83 to @xmath84 on either side of the barrier ; 3 .   the power of the repumping barrier beam , from @xmath85 to @xmath86 ; and 4 .",
    "the detuning of the main barrier beam from the @xmath4 ground state of @xmath0 , from @xmath87 to @xmath88 ( blue - detuned ) , measured with respect to the @xmath0 mot trapping transition .",
    "initially the separation between the beams was set to @xmath89 , which ensured that the tails of the gaussian beam profiles along the dipole - trap axis overlapped slightly .",
    "we believed the overlap was necessary to prevent the atoms trapped on the right - hand side of the barrier in the @xmath4 reflecting state from being pumped back to the @xmath3 transmitting state by the main barrier beam ( with an effective two - level @xmath90 ) , such that they would pass back through the barrier to the transmitting side .",
    "the presence of a small amount of repumping - barrier - beam light in the same region would rapidly pump any atoms that made it to the @xmath3 transmitting state back to the reflecting @xmath4 state .",
    "the overlap was designed to guarantee that atoms did not slowly leak back across the barrier .",
    "surprisingly , our studies of the effect of barrier - beam separation indicate that while overlapping the beams is important for optimizing barrier performance , it is not critical to barrier operation .",
    "figure [ fig : beam_sep ] shows populations on either side of the barrier after @xmath91 of evolution as functions of beam separation .",
    "the transmitting - side data show the most dramatic effect for separations below about @xmath92 .",
    "when the beams are too close together , the tail of the repumping barrier beam can pump atoms on _ either _ side of the barrier to the reflecting state , causing the barrier to reflect atoms from both sides .",
    "this can be seen for the small separations ( on the order of two beam waists and below ) on the transmitting - side data , where the majority of atoms stayed on the left - hand ( supposedly transmitting ) side of the barrier .",
    "we also see a higher loss rate for small separations , which we suspect may be due to atoms changing state in the middle of the main barrier beam as opposed to the tail , as well as changing state more frequently .",
    "when many state changes occur in the middle of the barrier beam , the large changes in potential energy result in a large amount of heating , which causes much more loss .",
    "large separations show much less effect on the transmitting - side data , although the @xmath4 data seem to get worse and then improve as the separation increases past @xmath93 . for atoms beginning to the right of the barrier , the beam separation does not severely affect the barrier s reflectivity , though the functionality of the barrier declines as the separation is increased beyond about @xmath94 .",
    "as long as the repumping barrier beam is still present to the right of the main barrier beam , most atoms will pass back through the repumping barrier beam after reflection , correcting any state changes that may have occurred .",
    "as the separation between the beams increases , more atoms may fail to make it back to the repumping barrier beam after multiple reflections , explaining the slow reduction in reflectivity beyond @xmath93 .",
    "this observation has implications for one - way barrier cooling applications that require a significant number of reflections from the barrier .",
    "we investigated how the loading position of the atoms in the dipole trap affected the dynamics of the one - way barrier as a substitute for changing the barrier height .",
    "the initial position affects the ratio of average atomic kinetic energy to barrier height , and so makes a decent substitute for varying the barrier height .",
    "however , it is important to note that changing the kinetic energy without adjusting the barrier height is not quite the same as changing the barrier height without altering the kinetic energy ; the two changes have different effects on the expected number of scattering events while the atoms traverse the barrier .",
    "appendix [ app : analytic ] contains a more detailed analysis of this assertion .     as functions of initial loading position .",
    "the initial loading position is the position of the zero of the mot magnetic fields relative to the focus of the dipole trap , in millimeters .",

    "[ fig : pull_back ] , we plot the atomic populations in the one - way barrier at @xmath91 as functions of initial loading position , as determined by the location of the center of the mot trapping fields .",
    "we see no obvious effect of the loading position on the efficiency of the one - way barrier .",
    "figure [ fig : pull_back_time ] shows some sample time - series for various initial loading positions . essentially , we see that atoms starting on the transmitting side are transferred to the reflecting side , and atoms starting on the reflecting side are kept there , independently of initial loading position .",
    "this indicates that the efficiency of our one - way barrier is fairly insensitive to the velocity of the incident atoms .",
    "while the intensity of the main barrier beam controls the height of the barrier , the intensity of the repumping barrier beam also plays a crucial role in the transmission and reflection of atoms from the barrier .",
    "we varied the intensity of the repumping barrier beam by over three orders of magnitude to observe its effect on the functioning of the barrier .",
    "the results for atoms that started on the left - hand and right - hand sides of the barrier are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : repump ] , where the populations of atoms on either side of the barrier after @xmath91 are measured for different repumping - barrier - beam intensities .",

    "[ fig : repump ] , the repumping barrier beam still pumped atoms to the reflecting state and the barrier acted asymmetrically , although less efficiently . as the intensity of the repumping barrier beam is increased , the tails of its beam profile , which extend to the left ( transmitting side ) of the main barrier beam , will eventually have enough intensity to optically pump atoms on the left - hand side of the barrier into the reflecting state before they reach the main barrier beam . in this limit",
    "the barrier becomes reflective on both sides , such that all atoms will remain to the left of the barrier .",
    "though we do not reach this limit in our experiment , these two limits together indicate the existence of an optimum repumping - barrier - beam intensity that we do observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : repump ] .    for the reflecting - side data in fig .",
    "[ fig : repump ] , we see the same decrease in effectiveness as the repumping barrier beam becomes too weak to pump atoms to the reflecting state",
    ". however , we do not see the same decrease in barrier efficiency as the repumping - barrier - beam intensity is increased , since a stronger repumping barrier beam just causes the barrier to reflect better .",
    "these behaviors in the high- and low - intensity limits are evident in the reflecting - side data shown in fig .",

    "the near - detuned and far - detuned data were collected with the main barrier beam tuned @xmath104 ( using a fabry - prot cavity ) and @xmath105 ( using the @xmath52 @xmath103 transition ) blue of the @xmath0 mot trapping transition , respectively .",
    "the near - detuned value was picked to be substantially closer to the @xmath107 resonances than our canonical value , but not so close as to increase scattering of the barrier - beam light enough to prevent barrier operation .",
    "the far - detuned value was conveniently close to halfway between the resonances for @xmath3 ( transmitting ) and @xmath4 ( reflecting ) atoms , and is actually a little closer to the @xmath3 resonances .",
    "this allowed us to compare a more symmetric detuning to our canonical case and test how damaging state - changing scattering events are to the barrier operation .",
    "for both of these data sets , the intensity of the main barrier beam was adjusted so that the height of the reflecting barrier was the same as for our canonical data ( with the barrier tuned to the @xmath52 mot transition ) , which is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq_life ] .",
    "the near - detuned data are nearly indistinguishable from our canonical reflecting - side data . the far - detuned data show a much shorter lifetime , but no extra leakage to the reflecting side of the barrier .",
    "this indicates the following :    1 .",
    "heating from scattering barrier - beam light alone is not much of a problem .",
    "if it were , then the near - detuned data , which should have @xmath108 times as much scattering as our canonical data because it is closer to resonance , should show much more loss .",
    "state - changing from scattering barrier - beam light _ is _ an issue .",
    "we believe we can explain this as follows . in both our canonical data and the near - detuned data , the barrier was much more likely to pump atoms to the transmitting state , which _ decreases _ the potential energy of the atoms , thus helping to cool them .",
    "the repumping barrier beam pumps to the reflecting state , but since that occurs away from the barrier beam , heating due to the potential - energy increase is small . in the far - detuned data ,",
    "the main barrier beam can pump atoms to either state .",
    "atoms in the transmitting state that are pumped to the reflecting state are likely to be ejected from the barrier at high speed .",
    "atoms in the reflecting state that are pumped to the transmitting state are more likely to be moving slowly , because they were being reflected , which makes them likely to scatter again .",
    "thus , atoms leaving the beam after a state change are more likely to have been heated than cooled .",
    "this increased heating decreases the trap lifetime substantially .",
    "appendix [ app : analytic ] discusses scattering in more depth .",
    "we also briefly tried having both the main barrier beam and the repumping barrier beam polarized parallel to the longitudinal axis of the dipole - trap beam .",
    "we saw no significant change , suggesting that the barrier operation is insensitive to polarization .",
    "we simulated the barrier operation using a simple model where atoms were assumed to be noninteracting point particles with well - defined positions and momenta .",
    "these atoms move in conservative potentials formed by the dipole - trap beam and the main barrier beam . at every point in time",
    "the atoms were assumed to be in either the @xmath3 ( transmitting ) or @xmath4 ( reflecting ) ground state .",
    "this is because coherences between these states oscillate at much faster time scales ( subnanosecond ) than the center - of - mass motion ( microseconds to milliseconds ) of the atoms , and so can be time averaged , effectively allowing each atom to be in a classical mixture of the two ground states .",
    "the potential the atoms move in is a sum of potentials from the dipole - trap beam and the main barrier beam .",
    "we assume the strengths of the potentials to be proportional to the local beam intensities .",
    "we use far - detuned approximations for computing the potentials , and we also use the rotating - wave and two - level - atom approximations for the barrier beams",
    ". the repumping barrier beam pumps atoms out of the @xmath3 ground state very quickly , and is too weak and too far detuned to produce a strong potential for atoms in the @xmath4 ground state , so we ignore its potential . after each time step of the integration",
    ", we compute a local scattering rate for each atom given the beam intensities at the atom s position and the current atomic state .",
    "the dipole - trap beam is very far detuned and has a scattering rate on the order of @xmath109 , which we ignore  in our simulation only the barrier beams scatter off the atoms .",
    "we then randomly decide whether each atom scatters a photon in this time step , with a probability equal to the scattering rate times the time step .",
    "a scattering event is modeled by a randomly directed ( with a dipole - emission distribution ) single - photon recoil kick applied to the momentum , and a randomly chosen atomic state change based on the probabilities computed in appendix [ app : state_change ] .",
    "we found that the simulations were somewhat sensitive to initial conditions ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_left_right ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_left_right_1d ] ) .",
    "we achieved very good agreement between simulation and experiment with the following initial conditions : atoms were initially placed in an oblong gaussian ellipsoid , placed to match the initial conditions of the atoms in the experiment we were modeling .",
    "the long axis lies along the dipole - trap axis , with a length comparable to that measured in our experiments ( we used a standard deviation of @xmath110 ) .",
    "the two short - axis widths were chosen so that most of the atoms started out trapped in the dipole trap , with some small variations to help match the simulations to the data .",
    "the momenta for each atom were initialized to random values with a @xmath62 maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "we also simulated the nonzero loading time .",
    "for each atom we picked a uniformly distributed random start time that was less than the loading time .",
    "each atom is frozen until its chosen start time , at which point its position and momentum begin to change according to the rules described above .",
    "this emulates the actual loading procedure , where atoms enter the dipole - trap beam and become trapped throughout the loading time .",
    "atoms just entering the trapping region do so with random momenta because atoms in a mot scatter often . once trapped in the dipole trap they become dark to the mot beams and begin evolving according to the dipole - trap potential .",
    "thus , atoms that have spent time in the trap have a preferred direction and position different from atoms that have just been loaded , as they have begun moving toward the dipole - trap focus .",
    "this gives a slight position - momentum correlation that just - loaded atoms do not have .",
    "the intention of having a load time in the simulation was to model this correlation .",
    "we also noticed that atoms loaded differently on one side of the barrier than on the other .",
    "this is likely due to fringes in the mot trapping beams .",
    "thus , in our simulations , we used two slightly different sets of initial conditions . atoms loaded on the transmitting side of the barrier had a temperature of @xmath111 , with a transverse standard deviation of @xmath112 .",
    "atoms loaded on the reflecting side of the barrier had a temperature of @xmath113 , with a transverse standard deviation of @xmath114 . in both cases ,",
    "the atomic positions were centered about a point on the trap axis , @xmath84 from the dipole - trap focus and the barrier beams .",

    "these initial conditions have _ less _ kinetic energy than those used in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_left_right ] , yet atoms pass through the barrier much more effectively .",
    "this is caused by an orbital effect in the dipole - trap beam , where atoms with angular momentum are slowed in their progression toward the trap focus ( see appendix [ app : ang_mom ] ) . as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_left_right ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_left_right_1d ] , the presence of angular momentum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_left_right ] ) does effectively slow the atoms . in some of our simulations , this slowing accounts for some of the atoms remaining on the transmitting side of the barrier after @xmath115 , because they approach the barrier too slowly to even reach it on that time scale .",
    "this effect can also be seen in our experimental data ( i.e.,fig .",
    "[ fig : compression ] ) .     repetitions .",
    "[ fig : sim_long ] ]    figure [ fig : sim_long ] shows data taken from an experiment much like the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : compression ] , except with a slightly lower barrier - beam power and carried out over much longer time scales .",
    "the simulations as described ( dashed line ) completely miss the experiment  we needed to include light - assisted collisional losses to best fit the data . in cold - atom traps",
    "there are several mechanisms where light affects collisions between atoms @xcite , which we collectively refer to as light - assisted collisions . in all of these an incident laser beam",
    "excites an atom which then decays . while the atom is excited , it either is affected by a different atom  atom potential or decays to a different state through an interaction with another atom , resulting in a large change in kinetic energy that ejects the atom ( and maybe another ) from the trap .",
    "thus , all of these loss mechanisms may be collectively modeled as a density - dependent loss term with a coefficient that is proportional to the probability that atoms may be excited , although we believe that one in particular ( radiative escape @xcite ) is responsible for our losses .",
    "we modeled light - assisted collisions by estimating the density of atoms in the barrier region and randomly removing them with a loss rate proportional to that density ( and the beam intensity ) .",
    "more precisely , if we let @xmath116 be the number of atoms in a small volume @xmath117 , then we expect the loss equation for @xmath118 to contain a term of the form @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the local laser intensity , and @xmath11 is the detuning of the beam . then @xmath121 is approximately proportional to the scattering rate of the atoms and the @xmath122 coefficient is independent of volume .",
    "this is the loss term we used to model light - assisted collisions .",
    "we picked @xmath123 to match the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_long ] , and used that value in all other simulations .",
    "the difference between simulations with and without light - assisted collisions can be seen in fig .",

    "density - independent effects provide a decent ( exponential ) fit to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_long ] , but we know of no mechanism that could explain such a large loss rate . we can rule out any effect not directly related to the barrier beams , such as collisions with background atoms , due to the much longer lifetime of atoms in the dipole trap ( about @xmath26 ) without the barrier beams .    if we divide our @xmath122 coefficient by the appropriate detuning ( squared ) for the experiment done by kuppens _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite , we find a coefficient of about @xmath124 .",
    "this should compare to the @xmath125 value of @xmath126 quoted in ref .",
    "our density - dependent loss simulations were too simplistic and approximate to expect better than order - of - magnitude agreement .",
    "in his 1871 _ theory of heat _ , maxwell @xcite contemplated a hypothetical creature who , being able to distinguish individual molecules in a gas , could separate hot molecules from cold molecules , resulting in a heat flow from a cold temperature to a hot temperature .",
    "this creature became known as maxwell s demon , and its apparent ability to violate the second law of thermodynamics remained an unsolved quandary for decades .",
    "everyday experiences , and even the thermodynamical definition of temperature , dictate that heat flows from high to low temperatures in an _ irreversible _ fashion .",
    "this implies that separating hot and cold must _ decrease _ the entropy of a system .",
    "one can also see how such a demon could be used to perform useful work by creating a temperature differential and using an engine to extract energy from that .",
    "many variations of maxwell s demon have been proposed , including a simpler demon that allowed particles into part of a larger chamber , but not back out again  a one - way barrier @xcite . compressing the physical volume of a gas without changing the temperature also decreases entropy , and again allows for work extraction from a heat reservoir without the need for heat flow into a colder reservoir .    today",
    ", maxwell s demon is usually handled through the concept of memory @xcite . in the case of the one - way barrier , the demon must somehow have a record of the atomic positions .",
    "if the demon knows the exact atomic positions , then to him each atom occupies a very tiny volume in phase space . by allowing the atoms into one side of the chamber , he is not really compressing phase space , but rather rearranging it .",
    "rearranging phase space is possible via normal hamiltonian evolution and is not a violation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "if the demon does not already know the positions , the demon must somehow monitor the system and determine when to allow atoms through .",
    "a measurement must take place , and some device must take action on the result .",
    "therefore , the measurement result must be somehow imprinted in the device . for the next measurement , either the result must be recorded elsewhere , or the first result must be erased . if the result is erased , that is an irreversible process which involves dumping entropy into the environment .",
    "if the result is not erased , then there is a memory record which goes from a known initial state to a disordered state , containing all the disorder that was removed from the atoms .",
    "thus , entropy for the combined device system does not decrease .    as a quick example , assume we have @xmath116 addressable atoms distributed between two equal volumes @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "a demon is preparing to make sure all the atoms are in @xmath128 , but the location of each atom within the two volumes is completely unknown .",
    "say the demon measures the position of each atom one by one , and if they are found in @xmath127 , then they are moved to @xmath128 .",
    "once it is known in which volume an atom resides , a process that swaps containers need not involve an entropy change , as the two volumes are of equal size .",
    "the demon now has a record of which volume each atom was found in . in the simplest case , this memory is a series of @xmath116 bits each set to @xmath129 or @xmath130 .",
    "we will assume this memory to be constrained by the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "we will also assume that the initial state of the memory is known , since writing a bit over an unknown state is the same as erasing , which , as described below , requires dumping entropy into the environment .",
    "if the demon erases the bit after each measurement , possibly to reuse it , then after each measurement the demon must reduce the phase - space volume of that bit by a factor of @xmath130 .",
    "this is because the erasure process must take _ two _ states ( representing which volume contained the particle ) and map them into _ one _ ( the erased state ) . attempting to avoid this by measuring the state of the bit to decide how to erase it just transfers the problem to some other memory that needs to be erased . by the second law of thermodynamics ,",
    "this entropy decrease of @xmath131 must be accompanied by a matching increase of entropy elsewhere , so that the total entropy does not decrease . after measuring and placing all @xmath116 atoms ,",
    "the demon must have dumped @xmath132 of entropy to the outside environment .",
    "if the demon uses @xmath116 different bits and does not erase them , then after the cycle is complete the memory is in one of @xmath133 equally likely states , since each atom was in either @xmath127 or @xmath128 with equal probability .",
    "to an outside observer the atoms are now in a smaller volume , but the state of the demon s memory has gone from a known initial state ( zero entropy ) to one of @xmath133 possible states , which is the same entropy increase as if the demon had erased the bits and dumped that entropy into the environment .",
    "this also exactly matches the entropy _ decrease _ of the atoms being compressed from two identical volumes into one .",
    "the observer can not know the initial atomic distribution without having made measurements of his own , either of the atomic positions or the demon s memory . in each case",
    "there is an entropy transfer .    here",
    "is a short computer analogy .",
    "assume the atoms are in a one - dimensional trap , with the position represented by a number stored in memory .",
    "the volume is proportional to the number of states the number can represent , and the entropy is proportional to the logarithm of that , which is proportional to the number of digits , or bits , in that number .",
    "the first bit of the number could represent whether the atom was located in @xmath127 or @xmath128 .",
    "the demon above could be thought of as taking atoms from @xmath127 and placing them into the exact same place within @xmath128 . in this analogy",
    ", that means forcing the first bit of the number to @xmath129 , effectively decreasing the size of the number by one bit .",
    "the number of total digits ( entropy ) did not decrease ; rather , one was split off and transferred to the demon s memory , and no longer represents part of the atom s position .",
    "this demon - powered barrier is similar to our one - way barrier .",
    "we can ignore extraneous effects such as photon recoil ( which results in heating ) , unwanted scattering , and beam jitter , and still account for entropy .",
    "all that is needed is the irreversible step and the corresponding measurement record ( memory ) associated with it .",
    "the `` memory '' for our one - way barrier is the repumping barrier beam , and it accounts for the entropy even if we idealize it . the ideal repumping barrier beam changes the state of atoms from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and leaves @xmath4 atoms alone .",
    "that irreversible step can take place because the transitions available to the @xmath3 ground state are of a different frequency than those from those available to the @xmath4 ground state .",
    "when an atom is changed from the @xmath3 state to the @xmath4 state , a repumping - barrier - beam photon is absorbed and a _ different _ photon is emitted .",
    "repump photons can not change the atom from @xmath4 back to @xmath3 , but the lower - frequency emitted photons can . completely ignoring random spontaneous emission directions ,",
    "we look only at whether the frequency of each photon is resonant with the @xmath6 transitions or not .",
    "each photon that is not resonant means that the number of trapped atoms was increased by one .",
    "let the trapping volume occupy a fraction @xmath134 of the total volume @xmath117 .",
    "it can be shown that the optimum setup is to have the largest optical depth possible , and as many untrapped atoms in the trapping region as possible .",
    "the number of untrapped atoms would normally be proportional to the volume ratio @xmath134 of the trapping region , but could be lower if many atoms had just been trapped . in this limit",
    "each repumping - barrier - beam photon increases the number of trapped atoms with probability @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the number of untrapped atoms , @xmath137 is the number of untrapped atoms in the trapping region , and @xmath138 is the number of trapped atoms .",
    "say we trap some fraction @xmath139 of the @xmath116 atoms , and it takes @xmath140 photons to do so .",
    "we can use the entropy of a two - part ideal gas to write out the change in entropy of the atoms ( two - part because the trapped and untrapped atoms must be distinguishable if the barrier is to tell them apart ) . the atoms change from @xmath116 atoms in a volume @xmath117 to @xmath141 untrapped atoms in a volume @xmath117 and",

    "however , that change is more likely to occur toward the beginning , when there are fewer trapped atoms that can become untrapped [ @xmath146 is larger when @xmath138 is smaller in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_trap ] ) ] .",
    "we can approximate the entropy increase for the repumping beam by summing up the entropy increase of the beam for each atom trapped .",
