    "<S> the role of spin - orbit interaction on the ground state and thermal entanglement of a heisenberg xyz two - qubit system in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field is investigated . for a certain value of spin - orbit parameter @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the ground state entanglement tends to vanish suddenly and when @xmath0 crosses its critical value @xmath1 , the entanglement undergoes a revival . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of the entanglement occurs in the revival region . in the finite temperatures </S>",
    "<S> , there are revival regions in @xmath2 plane where increasing of temperature first increases the entanglement and then tends to decrease it and ultimately vanishes for temperatures above a critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this critical temperature is an increasing function of @xmath0 , thus the nonzero entanglement can exist for larger temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the amount of entanglement in the revival region depends on the spin - orbit parameter . </S>",
    "<S> also , entanglement teleportation via the quantum channel constructing by above system is investigated and influence of spin - orbit interaction on the fidelity of teleportation and entanglement of replica state is studied . </S>"
