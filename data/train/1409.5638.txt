    "in recent years , the interest in describing slow and fast dynamics of many - body fermionic systems has strongly increased .",
    "this renewal of interest is largely due to the advances in experimental studies that allow to form and manipulate a limited set of fermions in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "dedicated studies have been recently made on the fast dynamics of systems after a quantum quench @xcite .",
    "most , if not all , quantum transport theories dedicated to interacting fermions use the mean - field theory as a starting point .",
    "deterministic approaches , based on density matrix or non - equilibrium green function ( negf ) evolution , that aim at including the effect of correlations turn out to be rather involved numerically and have been applied with varying predictive powers @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "several stochastic methods where noise is added to the mean - field , have been proposed ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . among these approaches ,",
    "one has recently attracted more interest due to its simplicity and its rather surprisingly good predictive power .",
    "this approach , called stochastic mean - field ( smf ) was historically introduced in the nuclear physics context @xcite . in recent years , it was firstly validated in schematic model in ref .",
    "@xcite , extended in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe small superfluid systems and shown to be competitive with most recent negf theories applied to lattice systems in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the smf approach starts from the following observation .",
    "time - dependent mean - field is generally adequate for describing the evolution of one - body collective observables but not their fluctuations especially in finite systems where zero point fluctuations can be large .",
    "in addition , even if fluctuations are accounted for at initial time , their effect on one - body evolution is poorly treated . as a matter of fact ,",
    "tdhf can indeed be considered as a quasi - classical approximation for many - body fermionic systems where quantal fluctuations due to two - body correlations are poorly treated .",
    "the smf approach is based on the fact that a quantum system can sometimes be accurately simulated by considering an ensemble of classical trajectories with initial values sampled from the initial phase - space @xcite .",
    "the use of such a strategy , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] , is far from being straightforward in many - body systems . in the pioneering work of @xcite , the collective space for fermions",
    "was assumed to correspond to the full set of one - body observables .",
    "then , four crucial assumptions have been made : ( i ) the initial phase - space has been obtained by imposing that the quantal average of first and second moments of one - body observables identifies with classical average .",
    "( ii ) consistently with the hypothesis ( i ) , the sampling from the initial phase - space can be performed using a set of eventually correlated gaussian random variables .",
    "( iii ) the mean - field dynamics is used to propagate each initial conditions .",
    "( iv ) at each time step , quantal fluctuations can be estimated using classical average . in ref .",
    "@xcite , some formal arguments were given to support these ideas .",
    "afterwards , it was shown in different test cases that the smf concept @xcite can be more predictive and versatile than anticipated . in the present article , we analyze in more details the hypothesis made for the initial sampling , i.e. ( i ) and ( ii ) . in particular , we show that such hypothesis seems to be rather effective if the initial state is uncorrelated , i.e. if it is a pure slater determinant state . the accurate description of correlated systems requires to go beyond the gaussian approximation for the initial phase - space .",
    "we show in that case , that smf can be combined with the standard husimi method to further increase its predictive power especially in the strong coupling case .",
    "our discussion is illustrated with the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model that has been used as the first sensitive test of smf @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will recall the minimal ingredients of the lmg model that are useful for the present discussion .",
    "more details can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the lmg model was originally invented to represent the interaction of nucleons in two n - fold degenerate levels ( one above and the other below the fermi level ) of a nucleus @xcite .",
    "it can also describe a system of n interacting spins in the xy plane under an influence of transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the lmg hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy gap between the two states and @xmath2 is the interaction strength .",
    "we set @xmath3 .",
    "the quasispin operators are defined as @xmath4 with @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are creation operators of the upper and lower single - particle levels , respectively .",
    "the quasispin operators satisfy the usual su(2 ) commutation relation , @xmath8=ij_z,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and its cyclic permutations .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) commutes with the total quasispin operator @xmath9 which has an eigenvalue @xmath10 .",
    "hence the spin quantum number @xmath11 is conserved . using the standard eigenvectors @xmath12 of @xmath9 and @xmath13 operators , exact solution of the lmg model",
    "can be obtained by forming the matrix representation of the hamiltonian in the @xmath12 basis and diagonalizing the resulting @xmath14 matrix .",
    "the mean - field approximation of the lmg model can be obtained by using the su(2 ) spin coherent states @xcite .",
    "the spin ( bloch ) coherent states are defined by @xmath15 where the two angles cover the parameter space @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the coherent states are normalized , @xmath18 , and the closure relation is given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the coherent state algebra , discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , can be used to get any moments of the spin operators .",
    "the expectation values of the first and second moments of quasispin operators are given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the symmetrical ordering of operators , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . by using the ehrenfest theorem and eqs .",
    "( [ firstmom ] ) and ( [ secondmom ] ) , the mean - field equations @xcite @xmath26 can easily be obtained where the expectation values given by eq .",
    "( [ firstmom ] ) are replaced with c - number quasispins @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is a relative interaction strength parameter .    the mean - field equations , eq .",
    ", can be derived either starting from a coherent state or from a statistical ensemble of coherent states .",
    "then , the mean - field equations are solved with the initial values @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the initial density matrix .",
    "if the initial state is a coherent state , we have @xmath31 .",
    "as we will see below , the smf approach allows to also make use of the mean - field equations , even if the initial state is correlated .",
    "in the mean - field approximation , time evolution of expectation values of the second and higher moments of collective observables depends only on the expectation values of the first moments , therefore quantum correlations of collective variables are mostly neglected leading to a classical picture . as demonstrated recently @xcite , the smf approach can partially cure this deficiency .",
    "the assumption of smf is that the dynamics of a many - body system can be approximated by an ensemble of independent mean - field evolutions starting from a statistical ensemble of initial values @xmath32 instead of the deterministic initial values given by eq . . here",
    ", @xmath33 labels a specific configuration of the ensemble . in the original formulation of smf @xcite as well as in recent applications @xcite ,",
    "it was proposed to sample the initial values using a gaussian stochastic process in such a way that the first and second quantum moments of selected one - body observables , here @xmath34 , are exactly reproduced at initial time .",
    "then , each event in the resulting ensemble of initial values @xmath35 is evolved by the standard mean - field equations given by eq .",
    "( [ mf ] ) .",
    "the final results are obtained by averaging over the ensemble .",
    "this approach was shown to describe accurately the short - time evolution of many different quantum fermionic many - body systems @xcite .",
    "since the mapping between the quantal and classical problem is made by imposing solely the first two moments of a selected set of collective variables , the gaussian assumption is a simple practical solution to the initial phase - space sampling problem and seems quite natural .",
    "however , in the following , we show that it might be sometimes advantageous to relax this hypothesis .",
    "below , we first test the validity of the gaussian assumption by considering alternative initial distributions .",
    "let us assume a simple distribution function , denoted generically by @xmath36 , for the stochastic quantities @xmath32 that can reproduce the initial quantum expectation values of the first few moments of the observables . hence we have @xmath37_d&=&\\langle \\psi_0|j_i|\\psi_0\\rangle,\\nonumber \\\\ \\left[j_i^\\lambda(0)j_j^\\lambda(0)\\right]_d&=&\\langle\\psi_0|\\widetilde{j_ij_j}|\\psi_0\\rangle,\\nonumber\\\\ & \\vdots & \\label{vdots}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38_d$ ] stands for averaging over the assumed ( predefined ) distribution function .",
    "in general , it is possible to define infinitely many distributions that satisfy the expectation values of the same set of finite moments .",
    "therefore , smf approach is expected to depend on what distribution is chosen and how many expectation values are satisfied by the chosen distribution . for this purpose",
    ", we consider three distribution functions for the observables @xmath27 , normal ( gaussian ) , uniform , and a bimodal distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : d ] shows the shapes of these distribution functions .",
    "the explicit forms and some properties of these distributions are given in appendix a. the parameters of the all three distribution functions are arranged so that the same quantum means and ( co)variances are reproduced .    .",
    "all distributions have zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the kurtosis for the bimodal distribution is arbitrarily chosen to be equal to 1.1.,width=283 ]      in all the following computations , time is measured in units of @xmath39 .",
    "the number of events for stochastic sampling is @xmath40 .",
    "the number of particles is @xmath41 , hence @xmath42 .",
    "for the sake of brevity , only one observable that best demonstrates the differences for compared conditions is plotted .",
    "the plots of the other observables , such as means and variances of quasispins , have similar differences for the compared conditions .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : jz1 ] , the exact variance of the observable @xmath13 is compared with the variances computed with smf approach using the three distributions . the initial state is the bloch coherent state @xmath43 which is defined by eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) .",
    "it is worth to mention that any bloch coherent state corresponds to a slater determinant in the lmg model @xcite .",
    "hence , slater determinant and coherent state terminologies are interchangeably used in the text .",
    "similarly to what has been observed in previous applications , the smf approach applied to an initial coherent state turns out to be almost identical to the exact solution for weak two - body interactions .",
    "while a careful look to the smf evolution shows that the use of gaussian approximation for the initial distribution is slightly better than the use of uniform or bimodal distribution , we see that the evolution is overall insensitive to the assumed distribution in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "this is quite surprising in view of the completely different shapes of the distributions ( see fig . [",
    "fig : d ] ) . in contrary , in the strong coupling case , the evolution is quite sensitive to the assumption for the initial distribution . in that case ,",
    "a much better agreement with the exact evolution is obtained with the normal distribution .    from this analysis ,",
    "it is tempting to conclude that the gaussian assumption is validated .",
    "however , the better agreement directly stems from the nature of the initial state .",

    "b ) weak coupling ( @xmath46 ) case.,width=283 ]    coherent states have gaussian ( or gaussian - like ) shapes that give gaussian - like distributions for observables . this conclusion can be drawn by analyzing the relative third and fourth centered moments generally called skewness and kurtosis of the initial state ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "the quantum skewnesses and kurtoses can be easily obtained from eq .",
    "( [ qusk ] ) as @xmath47 for the initial coherent state @xmath44 .",
    "the quantum skewnesses are close to zero and the quantum kurtoses are very close to 3 which is the kurtosis of normal distribution . for any initial bloch coherent state @xmath48 , the quantum kurtoses are very close to the kurtosis of normal distribution , therefore normal distribution is the best choice for the initial distribution of collective observables when the initial state is a coherent state .",
    "this will be further illustrated below by a direct focus on the initial phase - space .",
    "the smf approach has been originally formulated for initial states that are either pure independent particle states or statistical independent particle states . here",

    "b ) weak coupling ( @xmath46 ) case.,width=283 ]    figure [ fig : mixed1 ] is the same with figure [ fig : jz1 ] except that initial state is the correlated ( non - coherent ) state @xmath50 .",
    "this state , being an eigenstate of the two - body operator @xmath9 , is strongly entangled in terms of the coherent states .",
    "using the closure relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : closure ] ) , this state can be written as @xmath51 can be eventually obtained by inverting eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) .",
    "starting from this correlated state , the mean - field solutions for quasispins are constant and equal to their initial values . contrary to all previous applications where a simple slater determinant was considered initially @xcite ,",
    "it is observed that smf approach for all three distribution functions fails in the weak coupling regime . in this regime , it is also observed that the dynamics is very sensitive to the assumption made for the distribution .",
    "similar conclusions are drawn in the strong coupling regime .",
    "in particular , the gaussian approximation appears to be less accurate .",
    "this can be phenomenologically understood from the quantum skewnesses and kurtoses which are obtained as @xmath52 for the correlated initial state @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , the kurtosis for the correlated state is far from the gaussian limit .",
    "one of the motivations to introduce the bimodal distribution is that it is slightly more flexible than the others . in particular ,",
    "not only the first two moments can be imposed to match the quantal ones , but also the third and fourth moments can be imposed simultaneously . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixed1 ] , the kurtosis of the bimodal distribution is chosen to be equal to the quantum kurtosis given in eq .",
    "( [ bimkur ] ) .",
    "it is seen that even though the bimodal distribution satisfies the quantum expectation values up to the fourth moment of quasispin operators @xmath53 , the agreement between smf ( b ) and the exact solution is poor for weak and strong coupling cases .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in general , non - coherent states lead to complicated distribution functions for observables that can not be guessed .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the disagreement observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixed1 ] directly stems from the inadequacy of any assumed initial distribution to account for the complexity of the real distribution of the observables .",
    "this observation points out the necessity to improve the description of the initial phase - space without necessarily relying on a specific assumption for the initial distribution .",
    "in the present section , we show that standard techniques generally used to obtain the phase - space of a quantum objects can be advantageously combined with the smf approach to significantly improve the description of complex fermionic many - body systems .",
    "the phase - space formulation of quantum many - body systems is generally done by using one of the glauber - sudarshan p , wigner , or husimi q quasiprobability distribution functions ( see for instance @xcite ) . a stochastic extension of the mean - field description of bosonic systems , especially the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , is introduced by what is called truncated wigner approximation ( twa ) ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this approach , the mean - field evolution is given by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation and stochastic sampling from the initial wigner distribution function is performed @xcite .",
    "however , in general , wigner as well as glauber - sudarshan functions can assume negative values while the husimi function is strictly positive - definite hence it can be easily used for stochastic simulations .",
    "for that reason , we use the husimi function in the present study . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the initial husimi distribution function for the bose - hubbard model is used for constructing the initial quantum fluctuations .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation is again evolved with an ensemble of initial values that are sampled from the husimi function .",
    "our approach , while having a similar strategy , is different than the mentioned studies for two reasons : ( i ) the approach we proposed can be applied to fermionic as well as bosonic systems that can be expressed in terms of some set of collective one - body observables .",
    "( ii ) we provide a method to obtain initial phase - space distribution of any set of one - body observables and evolve them with the corresponding mean - field equations . as a result , a connection with the previous discussion on the smf approach with a predefined distribution function is clearly provided .",
    "we have seen in the previous discussions that the initial distribution of some desired observables ( quasispins @xmath54 in here ) can not be guessed in general situations .",
    "then , the only way to obtain the shapes of distributions of these observables seems to be through a quasiprobability distribution function of conjugate phase - space variables . before we explain how the initial distribution of observables is obtained with the husimi function , we provide some necessary background information .",
    "the husimi function is defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the initial density operator .",
    "the expectation value of an arbitrary operator @xmath57 in terms of the husimi function is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the antinormally ordered weyl symbol of operator @xmath57 .",
    "it is defined by @xmath60 the weyl symbols of quasispin operators read as @xmath61 where the expectation values are given by eq .",
    "( [ firstmom ] ) .",
    "one of the main subtlety with the husimi function is the fact that it is a completely positive - definite distribution although it is representing a quantum object .",
    "indeed , the price to pay to use a positive distribution is the necessity to use a renormalized quantity @xmath62 instead of directly @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ expa ] ) . as we will see below this subtle aspect has to be taken with care when coupling to smf is performed .",
    "the first advantage of the husimi method is that it can directly give access to the probability distribution of any states without assuming a priori its shape .",
    "the initial distribution of the desired observables can be written in terms of the conjugate phase - space variables by using the properties of the husimi function . in lmg model ,",
    "the conjugate phase - space variables are @xmath64 and @xmath65 which are the normalized relative population difference between the upper and lower single - particle states and the relative phase between the upper and lower states , respectively .",
    "the husimi function , eq . provides the distribution of these conjugate phase - space variables , that is the distribution of angles @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "these distributions are shown in the top panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : hus1 ] and [ fig : hus2 ] respectively for the pure coherent state and correlated state considered previously .    to make contact with the distribution of quasispins used in smf and discussed previously ,",
    "it is necessary to transform the two angles into the @xmath27 components .",
    "this transformation turns out to be less straightforward than it could be anticipated due to the use of the weyl symbols in quantum averages .",
    "the following strategy has been used here .",
    "first , an ensemble of stochastic angles @xmath68 that are sampled according to the husimi function can be formed by using the rejection method . at this point , a method that transforms the ensemble of stochastic angles @xmath69 to an ensemble of stochastic quasispins @xmath35 is required . the direct approach of defining the quasispins as @xmath70 where the weyl symbol is obtained by substituting the stochastic angles into eq .",
    "( [ correc1 ] ) will give the correct quantum means when averaging over the ensemble is performed but the variances will be different than the quantum ones , since @xmath71 .",
    "this problem can be resolved by defining the quasispins in an effective way .",

    "guided by the smf approach , the properties of the average and fluctuating part in the above equation can directly be deduced imposing that they match the quantum ones associated to the considered state .",
    "the first moment directly gives @xmath37_h&=&\\langle\\psi_0|j_i|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\left[p_{j_i}(\\omega^\\lambda)\\right]_h,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the second moment imposes the constraint @xmath74_h&=&\\langle\\psi_0|j_i^2|\\psi_0\\rangle-\\langle\\psi_0|j_i|\\psi_0\\rangle^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left[p_{j_i^2}(\\omega^\\lambda)\\right]_h-\\left[p_{j_i}(\\omega^\\lambda)\\right]_h^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where eq . has been used .",
    "assuming that the fluctuations in the new effective quasispins are directly proportional to the fluctuations in the weyl symbols , finally gives @xmath75_h-\\left[p_{j_i}(\\omega^\\lambda)\\right]_h^2}{\\left[\\left(\\delta p_{j_i}(\\omega^\\lambda)\\right)^2\\right]_h}}\\;\\delta p_{j_i}(\\omega^\\lambda ) ,   \\label{husqs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76_h$ ] . in summary , the quasispin phase - space associated to a given initial state can be obtained using the numerical scheme : @xmath77 where the angles are sampled according to the husimi function , eq . .",

    "this approach , where the initial phase - space of a selected collective variable set is sampled to get a set of initial conditions followed by standard mean - field dynamics , has been shown to tremendously improve the independent particle picture by including the effect of quantal fluctuations beyond mean - field . using the lipkin - meshkov - glick model as an illustration",
    ", we show here that indeed , the gaussian assumption is a good approximation if the initial state is not correlated as was always the case in all applications up to now @xcite . however , when the initial state is correlated and corresponds to a mixing of slater determinants , smf dynamics with the gaussian approximation for the initial distributions can fail even in the weak coupling regime .",
