    "molecular motors are protein molecules that drive a wide range of intra - cellular activities including transport of molecular cargo @xcite .",
    "there are many similarities between collective molecular motor transport and vehicular traffic @xcite . in recent years",
    "non - equilibrium statistical mechanics has found unusual application in research on traffic flow of various different types of objects starting from objects as small as molecular motors to macroscopic objects like vehicles @xcite .",
    "analytical as well as numerical techniques of the statistical physics are being used to understand rich variety of physical phenomena exhibited by traffic systems .",
    "some of these phenomena , observed under different circumstances , include phase transitions , criticality and self - organized criticality , metastability and hysteresis , phase - segregation , etc .",
    "a common modeling strategy is to represent the motile objects ( e.g. , a vehicle or a molecular motor ) by a self - propelled particle , ignoring its structural details , and then treating the traffic as a system of interacting particles driven far from equilibrium .",
    "these models belong to a class of non - equilibrium systems called _ driven - diffusive lattice gases _ @xcite . in most of these traffic models",
    "the dynamics of the particles is formulated using the language of _ cellular automata _ ( ca ) @xcite .    to our knowledge , the first model for molecular motor traffic",
    "was formulated in 1968 in the context of collective movement of ribosomes on messenger rna track @xcite . in recent years",
    "several groups have independently developed a class of minimal generic models for traffic of molecular motors which move on tracks that are filamentary proteins .",
    "all these models are essentially extensions of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite which is one of the simplest models of driven diffusive lattice gas systems . in these models",
    "@xcite the molecular motors are represented by particles whereas the sites for the binding of the motors with the tracks are represented by a one - dimensional discrete lattice . just as in tasep , the motors are allowed to hop forward , with probability @xmath0 , provided the site in front is empty . however , unlike tasep , the particles can also get `` attached '' to an empty lattice site , with probability @xmath1 , and `` detached '' from an occupied site , with probability @xmath2 from any site except the end points .",
    "parmeggiani et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated a novel phase where low and high density regimes , separated from each other by domain walls , coexist .",
    "they interpreted this spatial organization as traffic jam of molecular motors .",
    "none of the models of molecular motor traffic mentioned above distinguish between kinesins and dyneins which form the two superfamilies of motor proteins that move on the same type of tracks , namely , microtubules .",
    "on the other hand , detailed experiments over the last two years have established that , in contrast to kinesins , dyneins can take steps of four different sizes depending on the opposing force or hindrance .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to introduce a minimal model that distinguishes between these two features of kinesin and dynein motors .    in this paper",
    "we begin by investigating the aggressive driving model ( adm ) , a stochastic ca model for traffic flow that is closely related to the nagel - schreckenberg ( nasch ) model @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for studying this model is that it allows natural extensions so as to capture the essential features of dynein motor traffic including the unique features of dynein stepping ( which we shall explain in section [ dyneinexperiment ] ) .",
    "besides , the adm model is an interesting model of vehicular traffic in its own right and is also related to the fukui - ishibashi ( fi ) model @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the fi model , it still shows spontaneous jam formation .",
    "we investigate the properties of the adm by approximate analytical calculations as well as by computer simulations .",
    "then , we use an extended version , which we refer to as the dynein traffic model ( dtm ) , for a quantitative desciption of intra - cellular traffic of dynein motors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the adm and the method of simulation . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we investigate the properties of the adm with periodic boundary conditions and we describe the analytical theories for calculating its flow properties .",
    "we present a comparison of the adm with nasch model at the end of section [ sec3 ] . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we investigate the density profiles and phase diagram of the adm with open boundary conditions .",
    "in section [ sec5 ] we describe the experimentally observed hindrance - dependence of the step sizes of dynein motors and introduce the dynein traffic model ( dtm ) .",
    "we present the results for the dtm with periodic boundary conditions in section [ sec6 ] and those under open boundary conditions in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "finally we summarize the main results and the conclusions in section [ sec8 ] .",
    "in the cellular automata model of aggressive driving a lane is represented by a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the boundary conditions may be periodic or open .",
    "each of the lattice sites represents a cell that can be either empty or occupied by at most one vehicle at a time .",
    "the speed @xmath3 of each vehicle can take one of the allowed integer values @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the position and speed , respectively , of the @xmath7th vehicle .",
    "then we define the ( distance ) headway of the @xmath7th vehicle at time @xmath8 by @xmath9 , i.e.  as the number of empty cells in front of this car . at each time step",
    "@xmath10 the state of all vehicles on this 1-d lattice is updated in _ parallel _ according to the following rules : + @xmath11 : _ acceleration : _ if @xmath12 then @xmath13 and if @xmath14 then @xmath15 , that is , @xmath16 + @xmath17:_randomization : _ if @xmath18 , the speed of the @xmath7th vehicle is decreased randomly by one with probability @xmath19 ; that is , @xmath20 with probability @xmath19 + @xmath21:_vehicle movement : _ each vehicle is moved forward so that @xmath22 .",
    "+ step @xmath11 reflects the tendency of drivers to drive the vehicle as fast possible , without exceeding the maximum speed of the vehicle , and avoiding accidents between vehicles at the same time .",
    "thus , if there is enough gap in front , vehicles in this model can accelerate to the maximum allowed velocity within one single timestep.this captures at least one type of aggressive driving and hence the name .",
    "the randomization in the step @xmath17 takes into account the different behavioral patterns of the individual drivers , especially non - deterministic acceleration and over - reaction while slowing down .    as usual , the _ flux _ is defined to be the number of vehicles crossing a detector site per unit time . in the context of vehicular traffic ,",
    "the most important quantity of interest is the so - called _ fundamental diagram _ which depicts the dependence of flux on the density of vehicles .",
    "the number of empty sites in between a pair of vehicles is usually taken as a measure of the corresponding _ distance - headway_. the _ time - headway _ is defined as the time interval between the passage of two successive vehicles recorded by a detector placed at a fixed position on the highway .",
    "we have calculated all these characteristic quantities for the adm and will present these results in the following sections .    before presenting the results for the adm , we would like to compare and contrast it with a few other well known models of vehicular traffic . in the nasch model ,",
    "the calculation of the speed of a vehicle at the next time step ( @xmath23 ) during the acceleration stage requires the knowledge of its speed at previous time step @xmath8 and its speed after the deceleration stage depends on the available headway in front of it , whereas , in the aggressive driving model the calculation of the speed of a vehicle at next time step does not require any knowledge of its velocity at previous time step and depends only on the available headway in front of the vehicle .",
    "in contrast to the nasch model it therefore has no velocity memory . from now",
    "onwards , we shall refer to this model as aggressive driving model ( adm ) .",
    "this adm differs from the fukui - ishibashi ( fi ) model @xcite at step @xmath17 of the updating procedure . in the fi model",
    "the randomization is applied only to those vehicles whose final velocities become @xmath24 after the acceleration stage and , therefore , the fi model is unrealistic for normal traffic .",
    "consequently , the fi model fails to capture overreactions at braking which are responsible for spontaneous jam formation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in the special case @xmath25 , the adm reduces to nasch model @xcite with @xmath25 . in this limit",
    "the fundamental diagram is given by exact expression @xcite @xmath26.\\ ] ] the symmetry about @xmath27 in this fundamental diagram breaks down for all @xmath28 .",
    "[ fig-2 ] shows the fundamental diagram of the adm for different values of @xmath24 for fixed @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "\\(a ) ( b )    \\(a ) ( b )    for @xmath25 , the fundamental diagram of adm has a perfect particle - hole symmetry with a flow maximum at @xmath33 .",
    "however , as in the nasch model , this particle - hole symmetry breaks down for all @xmath34 and the maximum shifts to lower densities with increasing @xmath35 .",
    "the system remains in the _ free - flow _",
    "regime for densities on the left side of this maximum where the flux increases with increasing density .",
    "the densities on the right hand side of this maximum correspond to _ congested flow _ regime where flux starts decreasing with increasing density and finally vanishes at @xmath36 . for a given @xmath24 ,",
    "the maximum value of the flux starts decreasing with increasing braking probability @xmath19 .",
    "the fundamental diagram of the adm shows unusual behavior in the deterministic limit @xmath37 where the flux vanishes at @xmath33 for all @xmath28 .",
    "the reason for this unusual behavior will be explained in the following sections .",
    "the _ distance headway _ is usually defined as the distance from a selected point on a vehicle to the same point on the corresponding lead vehicle ( i.e. , the next vehicle downstream ) . since in our model",
    "all vehicles have the same length we can use the number @xmath38 of empty cells in front of vehicle @xmath7 as a measure of the headway . in fig .  [ fig-5](a )",
    "we have shown the distribution @xmath39 of the distance headway in adm obtained from simulations .    at low densities",
    "the distance headway distribution shows a broad peak near @xmath40 .",
    "this corresponds to the free - flow regime where the cars are distributed almost homogeneously .",
    "in contrast , at higher densities the peak in the distribution occurs at a smaller distance headway .",
    "in fact , the most probable distance headway decreases with increasing density .",
    "finally , at sufficiently high densities , the maximum of the probability distribution occurs only at @xmath41 .",
    "thus , with increase of vehicle density , the compact cluster of jammed vehicles becomes larger while large headways are strongly surpressed .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    the time headway distribution is determined by ( a ) the time interval between the departure from one site and arrival at the next site and ( b ) the waiting time at a given site ; the latter depends not only on the hindrance from the vehicle in front but also on the randomization parameter @xmath19 .",
    "equivalently , the time - headway depends not only on the spatial distance - headway but also on the velocity of the vehicles .",
    "a few typical time headway distributions @xmath42 in adm are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-5](b ) for a few different densities of the vehicles . at sufficiently low densities",
    "it shows a peak at @xmath43 as , because of the _ parallel _ updating scheme , minimum two time steps must elapse between the arrival of a vehicle at two successive sites even when it moves totally unhindred by any other vehicle . since mean time headway is the inverse of the flux , it is expected to exhibit a minimum when plotted against the density .",
    "the trend of variation of the most probable time headway with increasing density is also similar , as can be seen also in fig .",
    "[ fig-5 ] . at low densities",
    "the peak is rather sharp and it becomes much broader at higher densities . compared to the corresponding results for the nasch model @xcite , large headways are surpressed in the adm ; this is caused by the possibility of large acceleration whereas in the nasch only allowed acceleration is unity .",
    "the broader distribution at higher densities arises from the longer waiting times at each site which is caused by the hindrance from the vehicle immediately in front .",
    "this stochastic model becomes deterministic in the limit @xmath44 . in this special case ,",
    "the deterministic update rules of the model can be written as @xmath45 which leads to two types of steady states depending on density of vehicles @xcite .",
    "at low densities , the system can self - organize so that @xmath46 for all @xmath7 and , therefore every vehicle can move with @xmath24 , giving rise to the corresponding flux @xmath47 .",
    "this steady state is , however , possible only if enough empty cells are available in front of every vehicle , i.e. , for @xmath48 and the corresponding maximum flux is @xmath49 . on the other hand , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and , therefore , the relevant steady states are characterized by @xmath52 , i.e. flow is limited by density of holes . since the average distance headway is @xmath53 , the fundamental diagram of the model in the deterministic limit @xmath44 is given by _ exact",

    "however , for @xmath28 , the properties of the adm with maximum allowed speed @xmath24 in the deterministic limit @xmath37 are not exactly identical to those of the same model with maximum allowed speed @xmath58 and @xmath44 . if @xmath59 , then , for @xmath60 , all initial states lead to @xmath57 because in the steady state system self - organizes itself in such a way that there is a maximum headway of one lattice site in front of each vehicle and hence speed of all vehicles becomes zero immediately after the randomization step ( step @xmath17 in update rules ) .",
    "however , for @xmath61 and @xmath37 , @xmath62 for all @xmath63 . the maximal attainable velocity for every vehicle in this limit becomes @xmath64 .",

    "there are several possible ways of extrapolating to this limit since only finite systems can be treated in computer simulations .",
    "we here investigate the case @xmath69 .",
    "the fundamental diagram of the model is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig-6 ] for different values of @xmath19 in this limit .",
    "this fundamental diagram has a form quite different from that in the case of finite @xmath24 .",
    "the flow does not vanish in the limit @xmath70 since already one single vehicle produces a finite value of flow , @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath31 .",
    "another characteristic feature of this fundamental diagram is the absence of the characteristic plateau which is exhibited by the nasch model with @xmath73 @xcite .      in this section",
    "we will present the site - oriented mean - field ( somf ) and car - oriented mean - field ( comf ) approaches for calculating the fundamental diagram of the adm with periodic boundary conditions following the methods of @xcite after a brief review of the earlier works done in this regard .",
    "a somf theory was developed earlier for the fi model @xcite .",
    "starting with a microscopic relation for the updating rule , which describes the occupancy of each site on the lattice , a macroscopic time - evolution relation is obtained for the average speed of the vehicles by carrying out statistical averages .",
    "mean field equations are obtained as the asymptotic limit of the evolution relation .",
    "this gives average vehicle speed in the long time limit as a function of the vehicle density .",
    "a comf theory for the fi model was developed in @xcite starting with the basic equations which describe the time evolution of the headway in front of each car . by introducing the concept of inter - car spacing longer and shorter than the maximum attainable velocity @xmath24",
    ", the average speed of the vehicles has been obtained analytically as a function of car density in the asymptotic limit which corresponds to the steady state .      in the somf @xcite approach",
    ", @xmath74 denotes the probability that there is a vehicle with speed @xmath75 at site @xmath76 at time step @xmath8 .",
    "then , obviously , @xmath77 is the probability that the site @xmath76 is occupied by a vehicle at the time step @xmath8 ( irrespective of its speed ) and @xmath78 is the corresponding probability that the site @xmath76 is empty . using the definition + @xmath79 for the flux",
    "@xmath80 one can determine the mean - field fundamental diagram for the given @xmath19 , provided one can determine @xmath81 in the mean - field approximation .    according to the update rules of the adm ,",
    "the time evolutions of the probabilities @xmath74 are given by the following equations : + _ step i : _",

    "[ fig-7](left ) for a few values of @xmath19 along with the corresponding numerical data from computer simulation .",
    "the agreement between the fundamental diagrams obtained from this simple somf theory and those obtained from computer simulations is quite poor because the important correlations between neighboring sites are neglected in this approach .",
    "interestingly , in contrast to the nasch model @xcite , the fundamental diagram shows an inflection point at intermediate densities .",
    "this non - convexity of the flow - density relation becomes more pronounced for large values of the randomization @xmath19 .",
    "asymptotically , for large densities @xmath95 , the flow in the adm will be identical to that in the corresponding nasch model , i.e.@xmath96 .",
    "however , in the nasch model , and in many other traffic models , the flow at _ any _ density @xmath31 can never exceed @xmath97 , the flow on the jammed branch .",
    "but , in contrast , because of the possibility of large accelaration of the vehicles in the adm , the flow can far excced the value @xmath97 at intermediate densities . then",
    ", for obvious mathematical reasons , any smooth function with the asymptotic behaviour @xmath97 has to exhibit an inflection point .    in the nasch model somf",
    "always systematically underestimates the true flux because of the effective particle - hole attraction @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the same is not always true in the adm ( see e.g.  @xmath30 in fig .  [ fig-7](left ) ) .",
    "this indicates that the correlations in the adm at intermediate densities are somewhat different from those in the nasch case .",
    "since now somf _ overestimates _ the flow over a range of density , this indicates the presence of effective particle - particle attraction , instead of particle - hole attraction in that regime . this is a consequence of the large accelerations of the vehicles which lead to a tendency towards particle - particle aggregation",
    "this tendency becomes stronger at large values of the randomization @xmath19 , where fluctuations that reduce the velocity of a car temporarily become more likely .    in the next section",
    "we describe an improved mean field theory , namely car - oriented mean field theory , which takes into account certain correlations between the sites .      here , we present the car - oriented mean - field ( comf ) theory @xcite of adm with @xmath98 . the central quantity in comf theory",
    "is the probability @xmath99 to find at time @xmath8 ( exactly ) @xmath7 empty sites in front of a vehicle , i.e.  the spatial headway distribution .",
    "this approach is also known as _ empty interval method _ or _ interparticle distribution function method_. for a nice introduction and list of related references we refer to @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the probabilities @xmath99 can conveniently be expressed through the probability @xmath100 @xmath101 that a car moves @xmath102 sites in the next time step . in order to find the time evolution of the @xmath99 we first determine from which configurations at time @xmath8 a given state a time @xmath23 could have evolved .",
    "take for instance a car  called second car in the following  which has @xmath103 free sites in front , i.e. its distance to the next car ahead ( called first car in the following ) is @xmath104 sites .",
    "since the velocity difference of the two cars is at most 2 , a headway of @xmath7 sites at time @xmath23 must have evolved from a headway of length @xmath105 , @xmath7 , @xmath104 or @xmath106 in the previous time step .",
    "a headway of @xmath105 sites evolves into a headway of @xmath7 sites only if the first car moves ( with probability @xmath107 ) and the second car brakes in the randomization step ( with probability @xmath19 ) , i.e. the total probability for this process is @xmath108 .",
    "the headway will remain constant if the first car moves with probability @xmath109 and second car brakes with probability @xmath19 ( total probability for this process is @xmath110 ) or the first car moves with probability @xmath111 and second car moves with probability @xmath0 ( total probability for this process is @xmath112 ) .",
    "similarly , a headway of @xmath104 sites evolves into a headway of @xmath7 sites if the first car does not move ( probability @xmath113)and second car brakes with probability @xmath19 ( total probability being @xmath114 ) or the first car moves with probability @xmath109 and second car moves with probability @xmath0 ( total probability for this process is @xmath115 ) .",

    "<S> motivated by recent experimental results for the step sizes of dynein motor proteins , we develope a cellular automata model for intra - cellular traffic of dynein motors incorporating special features of the hindrance - dependent step size of the individual motors . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by investigating the properties of the aggressive driving model ( adm ) , a simple cellular automata - based model of vehicular traffic , a unique feature of which is that it allows a natural extension to capture the essential features of dynein motor traffic . </S>",
    "<S> we first calculate several collective properties of the adm , under both periodic and open boundary conditions , analytically using two different mean - field approaches as well as by carrying out computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> then we extend the adm by incorporating the possibilities of attachment and detachment of motors on the track which is a common feature of a large class of motor proteins that are collectively referred to as cytoskeletal motors . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of the boundary and bulk dynamics of attachment and detachment of the motors to the track gives rise a phase where high and low density phases separated by a stable domain wall coexist . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare and contrast our results with the model of parmeggiani et . </S>",
