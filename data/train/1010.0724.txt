    "x - ray emission of pre - main - sequence t tauri stars has been extensively studied over the last decades . the observed x - rays",
    "are explained to be from the coronal emission @xcite . in this study",
    ", we further investigate the x - ray emission processes of such objects and its evolution since their youngest ages .",
    "we present a study of a large sample of young stellar objects ( yso ) in the infrared and x - ray to probe their x - ray energy regime evolution from the youngest embedded and strongly accreting class 0 objects into the non - accreting class iii objects .",
    "we track their x - ray activity during their lifetime , and thus the role of the accretion .",
    "we cross - correlated the data archive of yso from the infrared spitzer c2d legacy project @xcite with chandra x - ray observations from the web based archive @xcite anchor ( an archive of chandra observations of regions of star formation ) .",
    "we spatially matched 109 detected ysos within 4  from three star - forming regions : ngc 1333 , serpens , and @xmath2-ophiuchus .",
    "we determine their ages from infrared spectral indices @xmath3 and classify them from class 0 to iii , using the color - color diagram with the four irac bands [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] and [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] .",
    "we used the sed online fitting tool developed by @xcite to deduce the envelope accretion rate and the age .",
    "we obtain the column density @xmath4 and the x - ray energy from anchor x - ray data .",
    "the column density decreases with the derived infrared index , or the more evolved class ii / iii objects are less embedded .",
    "these results show that our study is robust since our parameters are consistent with their physical implication .",
    "overall , the infrared index @xmath3 is slightly correlated with the stellar age . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well correlated with the accretion rate .",
    "nevertheless , we should point out that we have much less data for the older yso than for the youngest ones .",
    "they are also scattered in the plot and it is difficult to determine any correlation .",
    "we deduce in this study of 109 yso that they all emit x - rays independently of their ages . unexpectedly",
    ", the x - ray energy is somewhat correlated with the infrared indices ( figure 1 ) , and thus it is anti - correlated with the ages .",
    "it decreases with time and column density , while it was expected to increase .",
    "we find that the youngest yso protostars ( class i ) emit x - rays in the @xmath01 - 8 kev band .",
    "interestingly , we do not see an apparent evidence that class 0 objects have x - ray emission .",
    "the deeply embedded sources with the strongest accretion activity are detected in the hard - band ( @xmath1 2kev ) only .",
    "due to extinction , their soft x - rays are not detected .",
    "to explain the decline in energy , one could consider that within a timescale of few myrs the corona cools down via the accretion material , as seen in the pre - main - sequence herbig aebe stars @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the older yso ( class ii / iii ) emit only in the soft - band .",
