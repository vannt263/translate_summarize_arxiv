    "one of the most important issues for magnetic fusion is the confinement of heat and particles .",
    "turbulent transport ( most likely the result of drift wave instabilities ) causes a significant amount of heat loss in tokamaks and spherical tori.@xcite neoclassical transport , on the other hand , can often account for the poor confinement in traditional stellarators.@xcite however , modern stellarator designs , such as wendelstein 7-as ( w7-as),@xcite wendelstein 7-x ( w7-x),@xcite the national compact stellarator experiment ( ncsx),@xcite the large helical device ( lhd ) @xcite , and the helically symmetric experiment ( hsx ) @xcite have shown or are designed to have improved neoclassical confinement and stability properties .",
    "understanding plasma turbulence and transport could further improve the performance of stellarators .",
    "progress in design of stellarators for optimal transport has been made by coupling the gyrokinetic code gene@xcite with the configuration optimization code stellopt.@xcite    gyrokinetic studies of drift - wave - driven turbulence in stellarator geometry are relatively recent and comprehensive scans are scarce .",
    "most of these studies were done using upgraded versions of well - established axisymmetric codes which include comprehensive kinetic dynamics ( multispecies , collisions , finite beta ) to the more general case of non - axisymmetric stellarator geometry , in the flux tube limit .",
    "the first non - axisymmetric linear gyrokinetic stability studies , for both the ion - temperature - gradient - driven ( itg ) mode and the trapped - electron mode ( tem ) , were done with the linear eigenvalue full code,@xcite including a comparison of stability in nine stellarator configurations.@xcite extensive studies have been done with the upgraded gene code , including the first nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations.@xcite more recently , the gkv - x code , which uses the adiabatic electron approximation , has been used to analyze linear itg modes and zonal flows in lhd and nonlinear studies are in progress.@xcite    for this purpose , the axisymmetric nonlinear microinstability code gs2@xcite has been extended to treat the more general case of non - axisymmetric stellarator geometry .",
    "gs2 contains a full ( except that the equilibrium distribution function is taken to be a maxwellian ) implementation of the 5-d frieman and chen nonlinear gyrokinetic equation in the flux tube limit,@xcite with an efficient parallelization for modern supercomputers.@xcite it treats electrons and an arbitrary number of ion species on an equal footing , and includes trapped particles , electromagnetic perturbations , and a momentum - conserving pitch - angle - scattering collision operator .",
    "the extension of the code to non - axisymmetric geometry not only retains all of the above dynamics of the axisymmetric version , but also allows , most importantly , multiple trapped particle regions and multiple totally - trapped pitch angles at a given theta grid point .",
    "( by `` totally - trapped , '' we mean particles with such a small parallel velocity that they are limited to one grid point at the bottom of a well . ) tokamaks only have one trapped particle region , but as stellarators can have many deep , narrow magnetic wells which can trap particles ( though ncsx has only a single deep well , with other shallow wells , and is a bridge in configuration space between tokamaks and other stellarators ) . in order to treat the trapped particles accurately , one needs to resolve these wells sufficiently with high grid resolution . with the gs2 modifications , we allow for more flexible , decoupled pitch angle and parallel spatial grids , relative to the original gs2 algorithm which required every grid point ( @xmath1 ) along the field line to correspond exactly to the turning point of trapped pitch angle ( @xmath2 ) grid points.@xcite    beyond these extensions",
    ", a gs2 stellarator simulation requires different geometry codes to build its input grids than standard tokamak runs . for these non - axisymmetric simulations ,",
    "the geometrical coefficients are based on a vmec@xcite 3d mhd equilibrium , which is transformed into boozer coordinates@xcite by the terpsichore code.@xcite from this equilibrium , the vvbal code@xcite constructs data along a chosen field line necessary for the microinstability calculations : @xmath3 , the @xmath4 drift , the curvature drift , and the metric coefficients .",
    "while these extensions were used to study hsx plasmas,@xcite here we verify the non - axisymmetric extension of gs2 through comparisons with full on ncsx plasmas .",
    "good agreement between the gs2 code and the full code in the axisymmetric limit has been extensively demonstrated previously.@xcite while the non - axisymmetric upgrade of gs2 retains the nonlinear dynamics , in these studies we focus on systematic scans of gyrokinetic linear stability .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "the ncsx equilibrium used for the benchmark is described in section ii .",
    "comparisons between the gs2 code and the full code in non - axisymmetric geometry over a range of parameters including @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the density gradient scale length and @xmath7 is the temperature gradient scale length ) , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and geometrical coordinates are presented in section iii .",
    "further results using the gs2 code to investigate effects of density and temperature gradients are presented in section iv .",
    "conclusions and a discussion of future work are given in section v. finally , appendix a contains definitions of the normalizations and radial coordinate used by gs2 .",
    "all of the benchmark calculations use a vmec equilibrium based on a 1999 ncsx design known as qas3-c82,@xcite which is shown in figure 1 .",
    "this configuration is quasi - axisymmetric with three field periods .",
    "it has an aspect ratio of 3.5 and a major radius of 1.4 m. ncsx was designed to have good neoclassical transport and mhd stability properties and good drift trajectories similar to those in tokamaks .",
    "strong axisymmetric components of shaping provide good ballooning stability properties at lower aspect ratio .",
    "furthermore , the qas3-c82 equilibrium has a monotonically increasing rotational transform profile which provides stability to neoclassical tearing modes across the entire cross section.@xcite        for most of these runs , we chose the surface at @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the normalized toroidal flux ) and the field line at @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the boozer toroidal angle , @xmath15 is the boozer poloidal angle ) .",
    "the cross - section at this point is the crescent shape , seen in figure 17 of ref . .",
    "the coordinate along the field line is @xmath15 , the poloidal angle . at this surface ,",
    "the safety factor @xmath16 and the average @xmath17 ( the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure ) is @xmath18 .",
    "lastly , the ballooning parameter@xcite is @xmath19 , except in figure 6 .",
    "figure 2 shows the variation of the magnitude of the magnetic field along a chosen magnetic field line .",
    "resolution studies for the spatial grid used in the gs2 runs indicate that 330 theta grid points per poloidal period and about 90 pitch angles ( @xmath20 ) showed convergence in the growth rate to within @xmath21 , however @xmath22 error is possible with coarser grids .",
    "it was also found that a @xmath15 range extending from @xmath23 to @xmath24 was sufficient for a typical simulation grid , meaning that the eigenfunctions for the modes decayed to insignificant values before reaching these boundaries .",

    "both codes found large growth rates at low @xmath55 ( high density gradient ) and high @xmath55 ( high temperature gradient ) ( figure 7 ) , and agree well , though it can be seen in the frequencies that gs2 found a mode switch earlier than full .",
    "this can happen since gs2 automatically finds the most unstable mode , whereas full usually finds the mode closest to the initial guess provided to the root finder .",
    "in fact , there are three distinct eigenmodes within these regimes of @xmath55 : at small @xmath55 , even - symmetry tem modes dominate ; at medium @xmath55 , odd - symmetry tem modes dominate ; and at larger values of @xmath55 , an even - symmetry itg - driven mode dominates@xcite ( figure 8) .",
