    "very soon after the discovery of pulsars , it was realized that the very stable periodicity of the mean profiles of their pulses could only result from a source that _ rotates _ , and which therefore posesses a rigidly rotating radiation distribution  @xcite . in this paper , we show that this source rotation is not only responsible for the periodicity of the pulses , but also determines the detailed frequency dependence of the emitted radiation . by inferring the values of two adjustable parameters from observational data ( values that are consistent with those of plasma frequency and electron cyclotron frequency in a conventional pulsar magnetosphere ) , and by mildly restricting certain local properties of the source , we are able to account _ quantitatively _ for the emission spectrum of the crab pulsar over 16 orders of magnitude of frequency",
    ".    the rigid rotation of the overall distribution pattern of the radiation from a pulsar is described by an electromagnetic field whose distribution depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath4 only in the combination @xmath5 , where @xmath0 is the angular frequency of rotation of the pulsar and @xmath6 is the time .",
    "as we show in appendix a , maxwell s equations demand that the charge and current densities that give rise to this radiation field should have the same time dependence . therefore",
    ", the observed motion of the radiation pattern of pulsars can only arise from a source whose _ distribution pattern _ rotates rigidly , i.e.   a source whose average density depends on @xmath4 only in the combination @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , if a plasma distribution has a rigidly rotating pattern in the emission region , then it must have a rigidly rotating pattern everywhere ; we show in appendix b that a solution of maxwell s equations with the time dependence @xmath7 applies either to the entire volume of the magnetospheric plasma distribution or to a region whose boundary is an expanding wave front that will eventually encompass the entire magnetosphere of the pulsar .",
    "unless the plasma atmosphere surrounding the pulsar is restricted to an unrealistically small volume , it is therefore an inevitable consequence of the observational data that the macroscopic distribution of electric current in the magnetosphere has a rigidly rotating pattern whose linear speed exceeds the speed of light _ in vacuo _",
    "@xmath8 for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the radial distance from the axis of rotation .",
    "although special relativity does not allow a charged particle with a non - zero inertial mass to move faster than @xmath8 , there is no such restriction on the speed of propagation of the variations in a macroscopic charge or current distribution .",
    "for instance , the distribution pattern of a polarization current with a propagation speed that exceeds @xmath8 can be created by the coordinated motion of aggregates of particles that move slower than @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "such a polarization - current density is on the same footing as the current density of free charges in the ampre - maxwell equation , so that its propagating distribution pattern radiates as would any other moving source of electromagnetic fields  @xcite ; indeed , such superluminal polarization currents have been demonstrated to be efficient emitters of radiation in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "once it is acknowledged that the electric current emitting the observed pulses from pulsars has a superluminally - rotating distribution pattern , results from the published literature on the electrodynamics of superluminal sources  @xcite can be applied to pulsars . in this paper , we explain the recently - observed emission bands in the dynamic spectrum of the crab pulsar  @xcite using the calculations of @xcite . both the oscillations of the intensity and the frequency dependence of the spacing and width of these bands are described by a bessel function with a single parameter that is already constrained by other observational data on the spectrum of the crab pulsar .",
    "this bessel function is characteristic of the spectrum of the radiation by a superluminal polarization current whose distribution pattern rotates ( with an angular frequency @xmath0 ) and oscillates ( with a frequency @xmath1 differing from an integral multiple of @xmath0 ) at the same time .",
    "it differs from the bessel function encountered in the analysis of synchrotron radiation only in the relative magnitudes of its argument and its order : while the bessel function describing synchrotron radiation has an argument smaller than its order and so decays exponentially with increasing frequency , the bessel function encountered in @xcite , whose argument exceeds its order , is an oscillatory function of frequency with an amplitude that decays only algebraically .",
    "it is this slower decay of the bessel function in question that endows the emission from a superluminally - rotating source with a broad spectrum .",
    "the physical mechanism underlying the broadband nature of this emission is focusing in the time domain  @xcite : contributions toward the intensity of the radiation made over an extended period of emission time are received during a significantly shorter period of observation time .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ newsec2 ] describes how the most radiatively efficient parts of a pulsar magnetosphere are thin filaments within the superluminally rotating part of its current distribution pattern  @xcite .",
    "a knowledge of the morphology of these filaments  @xcite , and the ability of a source that travels faster than its own waves to make multiple contributions to the signal received by an observer at a given instant  @xcite , are necessary to understand many of the traits of pulsar observations described later in the paper .",
    "section  [ newsec3 ] summarizes our earlier analysis @xcite on the frequency spectrum of the radiation from a rotating superluminal source . using these results",
    ", we derive various features of the emission bands in section  [ newsec4 ] and compare them to the frequency bands seen in the interpulses of the crab pulsar [ figs .  68 , @xcite ] ;",
    "using a single input parameter , related to the pulsar s plasma density , we reproduce the observational bands and predict the final ultra - violet emission peak of the crab pulsar .",
    "section  [ newsec5 ] discusses the suppression of the bands by interference ; this is relevant to the much less frequency - banded microbursts and nanoshots of the crab s main pulses [ figs .  2 and 3 , @xcite ] .",
    "section  [ newsec6 ] describes the continuum spectrum of the crab pulsar ; by introducing a further input parameter related to the plasma dynamics we are able to account _ quantitatively _ for the whole emission spectrum over 16 orders of magnitude of frequency .",
    "section  [ newsec7 ] gives a short discussion and summary .",
    "the mathematical details of our arguments are presented in appendices a , b and c.",
    "at large distances from the source , the radiation field of a superluminally rotating extended source at an observation point @xmath11 is dominated by the emissions of its volume elements that approach @xmath11 along the radiation direction with the speed of light and zero acceleration at the retarded time  @xcite .",
    "these elements constitute a filamentary part of the source whose radial and azimuthal widths become narrower ( as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ) , the larger the distance @xmath14 of the observer from the source , and whose length is of the order of the length scale @xmath15 of the source parallel to the axis of rotation  @xcite .",
    "( here , @xmath10 , @xmath4 , and @xmath16 are the cylindrical polar coordinates of the source points . ) for an observation point @xmath11 with spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath17 ) that is located in the far zone , this contributing part of the source lies at @xmath18 , and is essentially a straight line parallel to the rotation axis , as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ]  @xcite .",
    "( the dimensionless coordinate @xmath19 stands for @xmath20 , where @xmath0 , the angular frequency of rotation of the distribution pattern of the source , is the same frequency as that with which the pulsar rotates . )    , the filamentary part of the distribution pattern of the source that approaches the observation point with the speed of light and zero acceleration at the retarded time , the orbit of this filamentary source , and the subbeam formed by the bundle of cusps that emanate from the constituent volume elements of this filament [ after @xcite ] .",
    "the subbeam is diffractionless in the polar direction .",
    "the figure represents a snapshot corresponding to a fixed value of the observation time @xmath21.,width=302 ]    once a source travels faster than its emitted waves , it can make more than one retarded contribution to the field observed at any given instant  @xcite .",
    "this multivaluedness of the retarded time means that the wave fronts emitted by each of the contributing elements of the source possess an envelope , which in this case consists of a two - sheeted , tube - like surface whose sheets meet tangentially along a spiraling cusp curve ; see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  @xcite . for moderate superluminal speeds",
    ", the field inside the envelope receives contributions from three distinct values of the retarded time , while the field outside the envelope is influenced only by a single instant of emission time  @xcite .",
    "coherent superposition of the emitted waves on the envelope ( where two of the contributing retarded times coalesce ) and on its cusp ( where all three of the contributing retarded times coalesce ) results in not only a spatial but also a temporal focusing of the waves : the contributions from emission over an extended period of retarded time reach an observer who is located on the cusp during a significantly shorter period of observation time  @xcite .",
    "the field of each contributing volume element of the source is strongest , therefore , on the cusp of the envelope of wave fronts that it emits [ see @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "the bundle of cusps generated by the collection of the contributing source elements ( i.e.  by the filamentary part of the source that approaches the observer with the speed of light and zero acceleration ) constitutes a radiation subbeam whose widths in the polar and azimuthal directions are of the order of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the overall radiation beam generated by the source consists of a ( necessarily incoherent ) superposition of such subbeams .",
    "this beam s azimuthal width is the same as the azimuthal extent of the source , and its polar width , @xmath24 , is determined by the radial extent @xmath25 of the superluminal part of the source  @xcite .",
    "this will be important in secs .",
    "[ newsec4 ] and [ newsec5 ] ; the @xmath26 dependence of the radiation intensity within the overall beam ( i.e.  what is observed as the main pulse , interpulse , and other components of the mean pulse ) thus reflects the distribution of the source density around the cylindrical surface @xmath27 from which the main contributions to the field arise .",
    "since the cusps represent the loci of points at which the emitted spherical waves interfere constructively [ i.e.  represent wave packets that are constantly dispersed and reconstructed out of other waves  @xcite ] , the subbeams generated by a superluminal source need not be subject to diffraction as are conventional radiation beams .",
    "nevertheless , they have a decreasing angular width ( i.e.  are nondiffracting ) only in the polar direction  @xcite . their azimuthal width @xmath28 decreases as @xmath29 with distance because they receive contributions from an azimuthal extent @xmath30 of the source that likewise shrinks as @xmath29 .",
    "they would have had a constant azimuthal width had the azimuthal extent of the contributing part of the source been independent of @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , the solid angle occupied by the cusps has a thickness @xmath31 in the direction parallel to the rotation axis that remains of the order of the height @xmath15 of the source distribution at all distances ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "consequently , the polar width @xmath32 of the particular subbeam that goes through the observation point decreases as @xmath33 , instead of being independent of @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "because it has a constant linear width parallel to the rotation axis , an individual subbeam subtends an area of the order of @xmath14 , rather than @xmath34 . in order",
    "that the energy flux remain the same across all cross sections of the subbeam , therefore , it is essential that the poynting vector associated with this radiation correspondingly decay more slowly than that of a conventional , spherically decaying beam : as @xmath33 , rather than @xmath35 , within the bundle of cusps that emanate from the constituent volume elements of the source and extend into the far zone  @xcite . this result , which also follows from the superposition of the linard - wiechert fields of the constituent volume elements of a rotating superluminal source  @xcite ,",
    "has been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .     within the distribution pattern of an extended , rotating superluminal source of angular frequency @xmath0 [ after @xcite ] .",
    "the point @xmath36 is on a circle of radius @xmath37 , or @xmath38 , i.e.  has an instantaneous linear velocity @xmath39 .",
    "the cross section is with the plane of @xmath36 s orbit ; dashed circles designate the light cylinder @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and the orbit of @xmath36 .",
    "( b ) three - dimensional view of the light cylinder , the envelope of wave fronts emanating from @xmath36 , and the cusp along which the two sheets of this envelope meet tangentially .",
    "the cusp is tangent to the light cylinder in the plane of the orbit and spirals outward into the far zone.,width=302 ]    the fact that the observationally - inferred dimensions of the plasma structures responsible for the emission from pulsars are less than @xmath42 metre in size @xcite reflects , in the present context , the narrowing ( as @xmath35 and @xmath29 , respectively ) of the radial and azimuthal dimensions of the filamentary part of the source that approaches the observer with the speed of light and zero acceleration at the retarded time",
    ". not only do the nondiffracting subbeams that emanate from such filaments account for the nanostructure , and so the brightness temperature , of the giant pulses , but the nonspherical decay of the intensity of such subbeams ( as @xmath33 instead of @xmath35 ) explains why their energy densities at their source appear to exceed the energy densities of both the plasma and the magnetic field at the suface of a neutron star when estimated on the basis of the inverse square law @xcite .",
    "in this section we summarize the results of @xcite relevant to pulsars ; the original intent of that paper was to calculate the spectrum of the radiation from a generic superluminal source that has been implemented in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "this source comprises a polarization - current density @xmath43 for which @xmath44 with @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the components of the polarization @xmath47 in a cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath48 ) based on the axis of rotation , @xmath49 is an arbitrary vector that vanishes outside a finite region of the @xmath50 space , and @xmath51 is a positive integer . for a fixed value of @xmath6 , the azimuthal dependence of the polarization ( [ eq:1 ] ) along each circle of radius @xmath10 within the source is the same as that of a sinusoidal wave train with the wavelength @xmath52 whose @xmath51 cycles fit around the circumference of the circle smoothly . as time elapses , this wave train both propagates around each circle with the velocity @xmath53 and oscillates in its amplitude with the frequency @xmath54 .",
    "this is a generic source : one can construct any distribution with a uniformly rotating pattern , @xmath55 or @xmath56 , by the superposition over @xmath51 of terms of the form @xmath57 . in the following discussion , we assume that the modulation frequency @xmath54 is positive and different from an exact integral multiple of the rotation frequency @xmath0 [ for the significance of this incommensurablity requirement , see @xcite ] .    although formulated in terms of a polarization current ( for which there is manifestly no restriction on the propagation speed of the variations in the current density ) , the results that follow hold true for any current distribution whose density depends on @xmath4 as @xmath58 in @xmath9 .",
    "the electromagnetic fields @xmath59 that arise from such a source are given , in the absence of boundaries , by the following classical expression for the retarded four - potential : @xmath60 here , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the space - time coordinates of the observation point and the source points , respectively , @xmath63 stands for the magnitude of @xmath64 , and @xmath65 designate the spatial components , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , of @xmath68 and @xmath69 in a cartesian coordinate system @xcite .    in @xcite , we first calculated the linard - wiechert field that arises from a circularly moving point source ( representing a volume element of an extended source ) with a superluminal speed @xmath70 , i.e.  considered a generalization of the synchrotron radiation to the superluminal regime .",
    "we then evaluated the integral representing the retarded field of the extended source ( [ eq:1 ] ) by superposing the fields generated by the constituent volume elements of this source , i.e.  by using the generalization of the synchrotron field as the green s function for the problem [ see equation ( 19 ) of @xcite ] . for a source that travels faster than @xmath8 , this green s function",
    "has extended singularities arising from the constructive interference of the emitted waves on the envelope of wave fronts and its cusp ( see fig .",

    "we conclude by re - emphasizing that all these features of the observed radiation are consequences solely of the fact that the emitting current depends on the coordinate @xmath4 in the combination @xmath5 .",
    "this constraint may be inferred directly from the simplest observation , that pulsars have a rigidly - rotating radiation distribution , and maxwell s equations ( see appendices a and b ) ; it leads to a current distribution with a superluminally rotating pattern at a radius @xmath9 responsible for the unique features of pulsar emission .",

    "since the above argument applies also to the new boundary of the region thus extended , it follows that @xmath305 will also be be independent of @xmath318 outside the surface @xmath304 , i.e.  will be a function of @xmath319 throughout the magnetosphere .    the corresponding results for @xmath320 and @xmath321 may be derived in the same way .",
    "in this appendix , we evaluate the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the anger functions that appear in equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) for a radiation frequency ( @xmath73 ) that appreciably exceeds both the rotation ( @xmath0 ) and modulation ( @xmath54 ) frequencies of the source , though not necessarily the frequency @xmath322 of its spatial oscillations .    in this regime ,",
    "the anger functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 can be approximated by the bessel functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively [ see equation ( 41 ) of @xcite ] . once we cast these bessel functions into the canonical forms @xmath323 and @xmath324 by introducing the new variables",
    "@xmath325 we can write the leading terms in their asymptotic expansions for large @xmath326 as @xmath327 and @xmath328 [ see equations ( 9.3.23 ) , ( 9.3.27 ) of @xcite ] . taking the limits @xmath329 of the coefficients and arguments of the above airy functions , we obtain the expressions in equations ( [ eq:12 ] ) and ( [ eq:13 ] ) .    for @xmath330 ,",
    "the argument of the resulting airy function and its derivative that appear in equations ( [ eq:12 ] ) and ( [ eq:13 ] ) is large , so that we can further use the asymptotic approximations @xmath331 and @xmath332 [ see equations ( 10.4.60 ) and ( 10.4.62 ) of @xcite ] to replace them by the trigonometric functions given in equations ( [ eq:14a ] ) and ( [ eq:14b ] ) .",
    "note that if @xmath54 is replaced by @xmath97 , the argument of the above airy functions assume a positive value , and hence the resulting anger functions @xmath333 and @xmath334 decay exponentially , rather than algebraically , with increasing @xmath125 [ see @xcite ] ."
