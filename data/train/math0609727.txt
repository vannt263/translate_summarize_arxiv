    "for a proper and free hamiltonian action of a lie group @xmath0 on a symplectic manifold @xmath1 the space @xmath2 of @xmath0-orbits in @xmath3 is a manifold .",

    "its geometry is completely determined by the ring @xmath4 of @xmath0-invariant smooth functions on @xmath3 .",
    "the description of the orbit space in terms @xmath4 , called _ singular reduction _ , was initiated in examples by cushman @xcite and abstractly formulated by arms , cushman and gotay @xcite .",
    "if the action of @xmath0 is not proper , then smooth @xmath0-invariant functions need not separate orbits and singular reduction is inadequate .    in 1983",
    "weinstein and i introduced _ algebraic reduction _ of the zero level of the momentum map which gives an interesting poisson algebra even for an improper action @xcite .",
    "the extension of algebraic reduction to non - zero levels of the momentum map was given by kimura @xcite , wilbour @xcite and arms @xcite .",
    "for a free and proper action , all reduction techniques are equivalent . however",
    ", if the action is not free , the poisson algebra of algebraic reduction need not be an algebra of functions even if the group @xmath0 is compact arms - gotay - jennings .    in 1982",
    "guillemin and sternberg proved that quantization and reduction commute if the action of @xmath0 is free and proper , @xmath1 is a compact khler manifold @xcite",
    ". generalizations of this result to non - free actions have been studied by many authors , see meinrenken - sjamaar and references quoted there .    partially motivated by algebraic reduction , huebschmann developed a theory of quantization of abstract poisson algebras @xcite .",
    "because of its generality , huebschmann s theory is rather difficult to apply to special cases . in particular , for poisson algebras of algebraic reduction , it does not assume  priori relations between the quantization structure of the original symplectic manifold and the quantization structure of the reduced poisson algebra .",
    "hence , it does not facilitate a study of commutativity of quantization and algebraic reduction .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a theory of quantization of poisson algebras obtained by algebraic reduction in terms of a quantization structure of the original symplectic manifold .",
    "our results provide a justification for an ad hoc quantization of the example discussed in sniatycki - weinstein .",
    "we discuss two special cases . in the first case",
    ", we consider quantization in terms of a real polarization and assume that the momentum map is constant along the leaves of the polarization .",
    "we show that there is a natural duality between the space of generalized invariant sections of the original quantization and the representation space of the reduced quantization .",
    "we illustrate this case with an example of the action of @xmath5 on the phase space of a particle with one degree of freedom generated by its kinetic energy .    in the second case , we consider quantization of a group action on a khler manifold @xmath3 ( not necessarily compact ) leading to a unitary quantization representation @xmath6 of @xmath0 on a hilbert space @xmath7 . for a quantizable co - adjoint orbit @xmath8 , leading to an irreducible unitary representation @xmath9 of @xmath0",
    ", we use quantization of algebraic reduction at @xmath8 to construct a projection operator onto the closed subspace of @xmath10 on which the representation @xmath6 is equivalent to a multiple ( possibly infinite ) of @xmath9 .",
    "this is a generalization of the results on commutativity of quantization and reduction obtained in a compact case by guillemin and sternberg @xcite and meinrenken and sjamaar @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that proofs given here are quite simple . yet",
    ", the obtained results incorporate some of the results obtained in the program of research on commutativity of quantization and reduction and generalize them to non - compact setting .",
