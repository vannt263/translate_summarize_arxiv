    "the theory of phase separation , or domain coarsening , has undergone a significant development in the last three decades @xcite .",
    "the most important finding is that well - defined ordered domains arise and grow with time in such a way that the coarsening process exhibits scaling . in other words , at the late stages of the evolution the system is characterized by a single length scale @xmath8 that gives a typical linear size of the domains .",
    "it is well established , at least for systems with a scalar order parameter , that @xmath9 with @xmath10 for _ non - conserved _ dynamics and @xmath11 for _ conserved _ dynamics . for the ising spin model ,",
    "glauber spin - flip dynamics exemplifies the former , while kawasaki spin - exchange dynamics exemplifies the later .",
    "several important correlation functions exist .",
    "one such function , the autocorrelation or , equivalently , the two - time equal - space correlation function , @xmath12 , is defined by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the order parameter .",
    "then , scaling implies : @xmath15 , with an exponent @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the general two - point correlation function , @xmath17 , can be expressed through @xmath16 , namely @xmath18 .",
    "exact results for @xmath16 are known in few cases @xcite , while the bounds @xmath19 with @xmath5 the spatial dimension were proposed by fisher and huse @xcite . for the @xmath20 vector model in the @xmath21 limit , @xmath22 @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the value @xmath23 is obtained for the voter model , defined below .",
    "this result indicates that both the upper and the lower bounds can be realized .",
    "it should be noted that in most coarsening processes the dynamics does not exhibit a qualitative dependence on the temperature @xmath24 as long as @xmath25 @xcite . at the critical temperature @xmath26 ,",
    "the dynamics is generally different , and ordered domains usually do not occur .",
    "however , the correlation length @xmath27 exists and grows with time as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the dynamical exponent .",
    "the correlation length @xmath27 should be considered as the analog of the domain size @xmath8 @xcite , and the the exponent @xmath16 is replaced by @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 . in the voter model , temperature is absent but since the dynamics is noiseless , the voter model dynamics is zero temperature in nature . however",
    ", the `` critical '' temperature is also zero . if one introduces noise by allowing environment - independent opinion changes , the system does not coarsen ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "furthermore , the corresponding generalizations to arbitrary dimensions were discussed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively",
    ". derrida _",
    "@xcite established the exact asymptotic decay of this quantity , @xmath36 , as suggested earlier by numerical simulations .",
    "another exact result @xcite establishes @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , for the 1d time - dependent ginsburg - landau equation at zero temperature .    for the voter model ,",
    "several quantities such as the one - time and the two - time correlations are exactly solvable in arbitrary dimensions @xcite .",
    "these correlation functions allow an exact calculation of the average number of opinion changes @xmath39 and other interesting quantities .",
    "hence , the voter model is a natural starting point for investigation of @xmath0 .",
    "although we do not obtain the full distribution , most of its features are illuminated by combining the above exact results with heuristic arguments and with the mean - field solution .",
    "generally , @xmath0 exhibits a scaling behavior . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the scaling function is poissonian and is peaked at @xmath40 , while for @xmath41 the distribution is maximal near the origin .",
    "additionally , for unequal opinion concentrations different scaling functions for even and odd opinion changes are found . using random walks techniques ,",
    "we obtain the even and odd scaling functions in the limit of an infinitesimal minority concentration .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first solve for @xmath0 on a complete graph .",
    "we then reexpress some exact relationships for the voter model , in arbitrary dimension @xmath5 , in terms of the distribution @xmath0 . combining with the mean - field solution ,",
    "these exact relationships allow us to guess the scaling form of @xmath0 .",
    "this guess suggests a usual scaling form in one dimension , and a mean - field like sharply peaked distribution for @xmath42 .",
    "these predictions are then compared with numerical data in one , two , and three dimensions . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe exact solution of the mean - field equations for the case of initially different concentrations . then we present exact results for the autocorrelation function in arbitrary dimension @xmath5 , and exact results for the fraction of persistent voters @xmath35 in one dimension .",
    "we proceed by investigating the extreme case of infinitesimal minority opinion . in this limit ,",
    "the model is equivalent to a pair of annihilating random walkers who are nearest neighbor at @xmath43 . simplifying further the problem to the case of a random walker near the absorbing boundary we derive a complete analytical solution .",
    "finally , we perform numerical simulations for the case of unequal concentrations and confront the results to exact predictions . finally , we give a brief summary in sec .",
    "in this section we first define the voter model . we restrict attention to the symmetric case , _",
    "i.e. _ , equal opinion densities .",
    "we start by analyzing the mean - field theory of the model , and then obtain several exact results in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we then present a scaling ansatz and check it using numerical simulations .",
    "we start by defining the voter model @xcite .",
    "consider an arbitrary lattice and assume that each site is occupied by a `` voter '' who may have one of two opinions , denoted by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "each site keeps its opinion during some time interval , distributed exponentially with a characteristic time @xmath46 , set to unity for convenience , and then assumes the opinion of a randomly chosen neighboring site .",
    "if a site is surrounded by sites with the same opinion , it does not change its opinion .",
    "hence , such dynamics are zero - temperature in nature .",
    "noise can be introduced by allowing a voter to change its opinion independently of its neighbors . however ,",
    "a voter system with noisy dynamics does not coarsen , and we restrict ourselves to the noiseless voter dynamics .",
    "these dynamics are so simple that they naturally arise in a variety of situations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "an important link is with the glauber - ising model : in one dimension , and _ only _ in 1d , the voter dynamics is identical to the glauber dynamics .",
    "this equivalence is not restricted to zero temperature , 1d noisy voter dynamics is also identical to glauber dynamics at a positive temperature .",
    "we now consider the voter model dynamics on a mean - field level , by simply treating all sites as neighbors .",
    "such a theory is _ exact _ on a complete graph .",
    "moreover , it is expected to hold in sufficiently large spatial dimensions .",
    "we first consider the symmetric case were the opinions concentrations , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , are equal , and the interesting case of unequal concentrations will be discussed later .",
    "the fraction of sites which have changed their opinions @xmath1 times up to time @xmath2 , evolves according to @xmath49 with @xmath50 to ensure @xmath51 .",
    "the distribution clearly satisfies the normalization condition , @xmath52 , and one can verify that eq .",
    "( [ mfe ] ) conserves this sum . solving eq .",
    "( [ mfe ] ) subject to the initial condition @xmath53 , one finds that the opinion change distribution function is poissonian @xmath54 in particular , the fraction of persistent voters , _",
    "i.e. _ voters who did not change their opinion up to time @xmath2 , decreases exponentially , @xmath55 .",
    "the probability that a voter has its initial opinion at time @xmath2 is thus @xmath56 .",
    "asymptotically , this probability exponentially approaches the value @xmath57 , and therefore voters quickly `` forget '' their initial opinion .",
    "the distribution is peaked around the average @xmath58 , and the width of the distribution , @xmath59 , is given by @xmath60 . in the limits , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 finite , @xmath0 approaches a scaling form @xmath64 where the scaling distribution is gaussian @xmath65 .",
    "this infinite - dimension scaling solution will be compared below to simulation results in three dimensions .",
    "to summarize , the quantity @xmath0 incorporates many statistical properties of the system such as the probability of maintaining the original opinion , the probability of having the original opinion , and the average number of opinion changes .",
    "we now review several relevant known exact results for the voter model in arbitrary dimension @xmath5 and reexpress them in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "both the one- and two - body equal - time correlation functions @xcite , are exactly solvable on arbitrary lattice in arbitrary dimension .",
    "it proves useful to formulate the voter model on the language of ising spins , _",
    "i.e. _ , a @xmath44 opinion is identified with @xmath66 spin and a @xmath45 opinion with @xmath67 spin .",
    "the state of the lattice is described by @xmath68 $ ] , the spin - flip rate @xmath69 reads @xmath70 with @xmath71 the coordination number . here",
    "the sum in the right - hand side runs over all @xmath71 nearest neighbors .",

    "the probability distribution @xmath73 satisfies the master equation @xmath74,\\ ] ] where the state @xmath75 differs from @xmath76 only at the site * k*. one can then derive a set of differential equations for the spin correlation functions @xmath77 .",
    "the single- and two - body correlation functions satisfy discrete laplace equations @xcite , @xmath78    on a simple ( hyper)cubic lattice where @xmath79 , the general solution for the average opinion is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the multi - index function , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the autocorrelation @xmath84 is of particular interest since it is related to the opinion change distribution via the alternating sum @xmath85 .",
    "the autocorrelation is found from eq .",

    "one finds @xmath88^d,\\ ] ] and thus asymptotically , @xmath89 .",
    "the diffusive nature of the problem ( see e.g. eq .  ( [ 1body ] ) ) suggests that the correlation length is given by the diffusion scale , @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the autocorrelation function scales as @xmath91 for arbitrary @xmath5 , thus implying that the exponent @xmath30 is well defined in all dimensions , and equal to @xmath32 as claimed previously .    the average number of opinion changes , @xmath92 , is simply related to the concentration of `` active bonds '' ( neighbors with different opinions ) @xmath93 : @xmath94 .",
    "evaluation of the active bonds density gives the following leading asymptotic behavior @xcite @xmath95 thus , when @xmath7 , the density of active bonds vanishes for sufficiently long - time , _",
    "i.e. _ coarsening takes place in low dimensions .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath6 , single - opinion domains do not arise .",
    "this is not very surprising since at the critical point well - ordered domains should not necessarily form .",
    "following the above discussion , the average number of opinion changes in the limit @xmath96 is obtained by integrating @xmath97 , @xmath98    the above results agree with the mean - field results when @xmath6 .",
    "we therefore expect that for @xmath6 , the distribution function @xmath0 approaches the poissonian distribution of eq .",
    "( [ mfscaling ] ) .",
    "similarly , the fraction of persistent voters @xmath35 should decay exponentially in time as well .",
    "interestingly , the exact result for the autocorrelation function indicates a subtle failure of the mean - field approach concerning the probability that a voter has its initial opinion @xmath99 . from eq .",
    "( [ auto ] ) , one finds that asymptotically @xmath100 , while the mean - field approach gives @xmath101 . hence voters have a stronger than exponential memory , even for @xmath6 . despite this erroneous prediction ,",
    "the mean - field theory is successful in predicting most features of the opinion change distribution function for @xmath6 .",
    "we were unable to find the exact @xmath0 distribution for @xmath102 , or higher moments such as @xmath103 .",
    "however , combining the above results with scaling arguments proves useful . in one dimension ,",
    "the average number of changes scales as @xmath104 .",
    "we assume that this scale characterizes the distribution , or in other words , @xmath105 .",
    "thus , we arrive at the scaling form @xmath106 in general we will use the notation @xmath107 for the @xmath5-dimensional scaling function .",
    "the nontrivial decay of the persistent voter density , @xmath108@xcite , implies nontrivial divergence of the scaling form @xmath109 , in the small argument limit , @xmath110 .",
    "the tail of the distribution corresponds to a large number of opinion changes by a specific voter and can be estimated by an intuitive argument .",
    "such a voter must reside at the boundary between two single opinion regimes , and must change its mind constantly .",
    "the probability that such a voter changes its mind @xmath2 times ( one time per unit time ) , can be estimated by @xmath111 .",
    "it is also natural to assume that the scaling function rapidly decays for large @xmath29 , @xmath112 . combining this form with eq .",
    "( [ 1dscaling ] ) gives @xmath113 and consequently , @xmath114 .",
    "to summarize , the limiting behavior of the one - dimensional scaling function are @xmath115 this scaling behavior is different in nature than the scaling behavior for dimensions @xmath6 . while for @xmath116 , a well - defined peak in the distribution function occurs near the average , the one dimensional distribution is a decreasing function of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the gaussian function @xmath117 is symmetric around its average , while no such symmetry occurs for @xmath41 , as the distribution is peaked near @xmath118 . despite these differences , the tail of the distribution of eq .",
    "( [ 1dlimits ] ) agrees with the mean - field distribution of eq .",
    "( [ mfscaling ] ) .",
    "in fact , the above heuristic argument for the large-@xmath1 behavior is valid in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we implement the voter model using a simple monte - carlo simulation .",
    "a simple ( hyper)cubic lattice is chosen with a linear size @xmath119 , and periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "a simulation step consists of choosing randomly an active bond ( _ i.e. _ , a bond between neighbors with different opinions ) and changing the opinion of one of the two voters . after each such step",
    ", time is incremented by the inverse number of active bonds and the active bond list is updated .",
    "this simulation procedure is efficient for spatial dimensions @xmath120 since the system coarsens and the number of active bonds decreases as the simulation proceeds .",
    "the results below correspond to one realization on a lattice of linear dimension @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 in 1d , 2d , and 3d , respectively .    in one dimension ,",
    "the numerical results confirm the scaling ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ 1dscaling ] ) , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "interestingly , the maximum of the distribution occurs at @xmath124 , and the distribution decays monotonously for @xmath125 .",
    "the postulated limiting behaviors of the scaling distribution are also confirmed . to test the validity of the mean - field theory , we performed numerical simulations in three dimensions .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 distribution agrees with the poissonian distribution of eq .",
    "( [ mfs ] ) , and furthermore the fraction of persistent voters decays exponentially .",
    "these results indicate that the above mentioned discrepancy regarding the autocorrelation function is not crucial in understanding the opinion change distribution function .",
    "the marginal two - dimensional case is especially interesting .",
    "while it is expected that the distribution will be roughly poissonian , some deviation from the mean - field predictions are expected .",
    "we find numerically that the distribution obeys the scaling form of eq .",
    "( [ mfscaling ] ) , and exhibits a well defined peak in the vicinity of @xmath126 .",
    "however , in 2d , the system still coarsens , and the distribution exhibits some low- dimensional features . the distribution is not a symmetric function of the variable @xmath127 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "additionally , an intriguing behavior for the fraction of persistent voters is found numerically ( fig .",
    "3 ) , @xmath128 thus the fraction of persistent voters decays faster than the 1d power - law behavior , and slower than the mean - field exponential behavior and a naive logarithmic correction to the mean - field behavior does not hold . the width of the distribution @xmath59 is not given by a logarithmic correction to the mean - field ( where @xmath129 ) , and our best fit gives @xmath130 with @xmath131 .",
    "the 2d case is difficult from a numerical point of view since logarithmic corrections occur , and a large temporal range is required to distinguish such slowly varying corrections from algebraic behavior with small exponents @xcite .",
    "our previous exposition has assumed that the initial concentrations of dissimilar species are equal , @xmath132 .",
    "the case of unequal concentrations , @xmath133 , is interesting as well .",
    "the reason is that the voter model dynamics has a remarkable feature : although _ locally _ the opinion does change ( the dynamics is non - conserved in nature ) , _ globally _ both opinions are conserved . on the language of the ising model",
    "it can be said that at zero temperature the magnetization remains constant .",
    "this hidden integral leads to several peculiarities which will be illuminated first on a mean - field level and then for a special case in one dimension .      to write the general mean - field theory ,",
    "it is necessary to distinguish between voters according to their initial opinions .",
    "hence , we introduce @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) , the fraction of voters with the @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) initial opinion that have changed their opinion @xmath1 times up to time @xmath2 . if all sites are neighbors , these distributions evolve according to @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath138 .",
    "these rate equations reduce to eq .",
    "( [ mfe ] ) for the symmetric case @xmath132 .",

    "the fraction of persistent voters is found by solving @xmath147 and it is found that @xmath148 thus , the fraction of persistent voters decays exponentially as well . the decay constant is simply given by the density of opposite opinion .",
    "this result indicates that even in the case of a small concentration of one opinion , the fraction of persistent majority voters decays exponentially with time .    to solve eqs .",

    "this leads to rather cumbersome results .",

    "( [ gen ] ) we find @xmath160 .",
    "then we find @xmath151 , note that in the scaling limit the generating functions become the laplace transforms of @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and perform the inverse transformation .",

    "( [ final ] ) suggests that it is possible to avoid these `` even - odd oscillations '' , by making a transformation to a modified opinion change distribution @xmath164 .",
    "we also note that the scaling distribution in the right hand side of eq .",

    "again the conclusion remains the same , at the late stages of the process a single voter opinion can not be used to determine its initial opinion .",
    "similar to the symmetric case , the autocorrelation function decays algebraically rather than exponentially with time . since @xmath167",
