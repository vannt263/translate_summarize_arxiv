    "the r - process has been understood for many years to ( 1 ) synthesize half the nuclides heavier than iron , ( 2 ) synthesize all of the nuclides heavier than @xmath0bi , and ( 3 ) be primary in the sense that its nucleosynthesis does not appear to depend on preexisting nuclides @xcite . in this latter context , its production of the heavier r - process nuclides in many metal poor stars appears to be very uniform @xcite , and it also produces relative r - process abundances that are essentially the same as those found in more modern stars .",
    "a standard interpretation of the r - process suggests that it occurs in the neutrino wind that emanates from core - collapse supernovae @xcite , although that interpretation is not without its issues @xcite . even with these difficulties ,",
    "though , there are a sufficient number of uncertainties , e.g. , the possibility of sterile neutrinos @xcite , that this r - process site might turn out to be viable .    at the same time , other metal poor stars exhibit some of the features of r - process nucleosynthesis , but their abundances represent a surprisingly poor match with the `` standard '' abundance template @xcite , perhaps most frequently identified as that observed in cs-22892 - 052 @xcite .",
    "a recent paper @xcite has summarized the situation that exists for metal - poor stars .",
    "the data in that paper seem to suggest that a distribution of r - process abundances exists in metal poor stars , with some resembling the standard abundance set , but with a significant fraction of stars having abundances that do not match the standard template .",
    "these latter stars appear to favor the lighter r - process nuclides at varying levels , and many seem to have abundance patterns that terminate around dy , that is , around mass 160 .    in this letter",
    "we point out that the abundance patterns observed for the stars that do not fit the standard r - process template could be produced by stars that are sufficiently massive that their core collapse first produce neutron stars but that the infall that occurs following the formation of the neutron star subsequently results in collapse to a black hole - so called `` fallback supernovae . ''",
    "this class of stars spans a mass range from roughly 25 to 40 solar masses @xcite for low - metallicity stars .",
    "when the neutron star collapses to a black hole the r - process enrichment of the interstellar medium would cease , terminating either when the r - processed regions were swallowed by the black hole , or when the electron antineutrinos fell below the event horizon @xcite .",
    "thus , this truncated r - process , or tr - process , nucleosynthesis would terminate at different stages of that process , depending on the precise time at which the black hole prevented further r - process production or emission of nuclides into the interstellar medium .",
    "we suggest that the delayed collapse to the black hole , combined with another effect , namely , the difficulties in observing the higher mass rare earths , could produce the cutoff in the r - process distributions observed around 160 u.    the general scenario we envision merely assumes that mass elements that predominantly produce the lighter r - process nuclei are ejected before the mass elements that produce the heavier r - process nuclides .",
    "any setting within a core - collapse supernova that satisfies this condition would allow for a truncated r - process .",
    "to evaluate this idea quantitatively , however , we apply the neutrino - driven wind model for the r - process .",
    "although , as noted above , this model is not without issues ; it is plausible and well discussed in the literature and makes a good setting for discussing the truncated r - process .",
    "in the neutrino wind scenario of the r - process , neutrinos from the nascent neutron star heat material at the neutron star surface and drive it away in a wind .",
    "as a wind element leaves the neutron star surface , it expands and cools .",
    "nucleons in the wind element assemble into heavier nuclei , which serve as the seeds for the subsequent r - process @xcite .",
    "importantly , the abundance pattern for the seed nuclei is well - described by a quasi - equilibrium , which , for the entropy and neutron richness characteristic of neutrino - driven wind envirnoments , has a relatively sharp abundance peak near a@xmath1100 . as the temperature in the wind element falls further , charged - particle reactions freeze out .",
    "if a high neutron density accompanies the seed nuclei , neutron captures and beta decays successively promote the seed nuclei to higher mass .",
    "this upwards flow in mass slows at the neutron closed shells at 82 and then 126 neutrons , and thereby produces the r - process abundance peaks at a@xmath1130 and 195 u @xcite .    for what follows ,",
    "it is essential to note that the neutrino - driven wind leaves the star over a period of several seconds . in the standard scenario @xcite",
    ", the wind elements that leave the star early have lower entropy and a lower degree of neutron richness .",
    "as the neutron star evolves , the wind elements that leave later have higher entropy and a greater degree of neutron richness .",
    "it is in these latter wind elements that the heaviest nuclei are made .",
    "the lower - entropy , less neutron rich wind elements that leave the neutron star earlier produce ligher nuclei .",
    "if the neutron star collapses to a black hole after the lower - entropy elements leave the star but before the higher - entropy do , then the r - process has been truncated , and the abundance pattern will be dominated by lighter r - process nuclei .",
    "current supernova models do not naturally produce the parameters required to produce a successful r - process , most notably the entropy , but also the requisite neutron richness . while it may in fact be the case that core - collapse supernovae are not the site of the r - process",
    ", it may also be that current supernova models are not sufficiently detailed to provide an adequate description of the r - process conditions in core - collapse events .",
    "for example , results from multidimensional hydrodynamics calculations suggest that the instabilities resulting from those calculations may ultimately be shown to produce the entropy required for making the heaviest r - process nuclei @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these instabilities may generate the neutron star kicks @xcite that give rise to high space velocities of some pulsars @xcite .",
    "it will also be necessary to include all of the detailed neutrino physics @xcite to adequately characterize the neutron richness in matter expelled from the supernova .",
    "future work will determine whether more advanced core - collapse supernova models will provide the conditions needed for the r - process .",
    "for the purposes of the present paper , we will simply assume that neutrino - driven winds in core - collapse supernovae are at least one of the sites of r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "to study the truncated r - process in the neutrino - driven wind , we applied the basic idea behind the study of @xcite , which assumed that the r - process occurred in the neutrino wind from a core collapse supernova . in that study ,",
    "a succession of 40 `` trajectories '' ( that is , thin shell wind elements ) , all assumed to have originated deep within the ( assumed spherically symmetric ) star , but having initially different conditions of density , temperature , entropy , and electron fraction , were emitted into the interstellar medium , thus contributing to the total r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "the bubble was evolving in time , so that the conditions under which the individual trajectories were processed changed with the identity of the trajectory .",
    "we assumed that the different trajectories were emitted from the star successively , but ceased to be emitted when the collapse to the black hole occurred .",
    "this would be consistent with @xcite , who assumed successive emissions of the trajectories to generate what turned out to be a good representation of the solar r - process abundances .    for our r - process calculations , we used a network code based on libnucnet , a library of c codes for storing and managing nuclear reaction networks @xcite .",
    "the nuclear and reaction data for the calculations were taken from the jina reaclib database @xcite .",
    "we performed calculations for trajectories 24 - 40 in the @xcite hydrodynamics model . for each trajectory",
    ", reaction network calculations were performed for t@xmath22.5 using initial abundances derived from the @xcite results .",
    "our calculations were simplified by assuming an initial abundance of massive nuclei from a single nucleus heavy seed with a mass a equal to the average mass at t@xmath3=2.5 and an atomic number derived from the average mass number , the y@xmath4 , and the neutron and alpha mass fractions at t@xmath3=2.5 in @xcite .",
    "we justify this by noting that the heavy - nuclide distribution is typically sharply peaked near t@xmath3=2.5 .",
    "an adiabatic expansion was assumed for each trajectory in the nucleosynthesis , with entropy constant within a trajectory but varying between trajectories , again consistent with the approach of @xcite for times at which the temperature t@xmath22.5 .",
    "the material was taken to expand at constant velocity on a timescale consistent with that derived from @xcite . for each trajectory",
    "the calculation was continued until neutron capture reactions had ceased and the abundance distribution versus mass number had frozen out .",
    "our representation of the full r - process abundances , shown as the dots in figure [ woo_traj ] , is not as good as that achieved by @xcite , but our calculations do produce the basic features of the full r - process , namely the mass 130 and 195u peaks .",
    "the simulation of @xcite that produced a good r - process representation began with trajectory number 24 and summed the nucleosynthesis yields from the remaining 16 elements since all of these trajectories would have been ejected into the interstellar medium .",
    "we also began with trajectory 24 , and performed a mass weighted sum of the nucleosynthesis from the trajectories up to some higher number trajectory to observe the resulting nucleosynthesis when the trajectories beyond our maximum trajectory were assumed to be consumed by the collapse to a black hole .",
    "this produced a result similar to that of @xcite when all trajectories from 24 to 40 were included .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ woo_traj ] . there",
    "it can be seen that truncating the r - process at increasing trajectory number does terminate the r - process nucleosynthesis at increasingly higher nuclear mass .",
    "note that although the curve representing trajectories 24 through 31 does reach the mass 195u peak , the abundance produced in that calculation is nearly two orders of magnitude below that of the full r - process , which would render the higher mass nuclides difficult to observe .",
    "the abundances for that calculation would therefore appear observationally to terminate at a mass of about 140 u.    in figure [ ele_abun ] we compare several tr - process calculations with the derived elemental abundance pattern in the metal poor halo star hd 122563 .",
    "this low - metallicity star ( [ fe / h ] = -2.7 ) is deficient in the heavy neutron - capture elements ( ba and heavier ) relative to the light neutron - capture elements ( sr through cd ) when compared with the scaled solar r - process pattern .",
    "the hd 122563 abundances are a very poor match to the scaled solar s - process pattern .",
    "its abundance pattern matches the scaled solar r - process pattern better up to an atomic mass of about 70 ( mass of @xmath1174 u ) , but even this fit is unsatisfying @xcite .",
    "stars like hd 122563 may be candidates for enrichment by the tr - process .",
    "figure [ ele_abun ] demonstrates that the tr - process predictions , while far from a perfect match to the individual abundances , can reproduce the relative downward trend in abundance with increasing atomic number seen in some metal poor stars .",
    "more exploration of tr - process calculations is obviously needed , but the general trend is encouraging .",
    "in principle , a test of the tr - process model would be provided by a large set of data for metal poor stars that spans the masses of the nuclides produced in the r - process from mass @xmath180 to the heaviest observable nuclides that the r - process synthesizes , usually thorium .",
    "unfortunately this is challenging due to the difficulty of observing the higher mass rare - earth nuclides , starting at mass @xmath1160 .",
    "thus all r - process events that terminate at masses between 160 and lead would appear to terminate at mass 160 , producing the effect observed by @xcite .",
    "any standard initial mass function ( imf ) reflects the fact that less - massive stars are more numerous than more - massive stars . assuming that stars from 8 to 40 solar masses may produce comparable amounts of r - process material",
    ", we can use the imf to estimate the fraction of stars whose r - process may be truncated by collapse to a black hole .",
    "we adopt the @xcite imf , for which dn / dm @xmath5 m@xmath6 for massive stars , where m is the stellar mass in units of the solar mass , and n is the number of stars of a given mass per unit volume .",
    "the ratio of the number of stars that would be expected to collapse to black holes ( 25 - 40 solar masses ) to those expected to collapse to neutron stars ( 8 - 25 solar masses ) is 0.13 in a well - sampled imf .",
    "while a number of r - process rich stars ( here taken to mean stars with [ eu / fe ] @xmath7 + 1.0 ) have been discovered and studied in detail in the last two decades , these stars constitute a relatively minor fraction of all metal - poor stars .",
    "more unbiased samples @xcite find that stars with [ eu / fe ] @xmath7 + 1.0 comprise @xmath810% of all stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath8 -2.0 .",
    "figure 11 of @xcite suggests that stars with [ eu / fe ] @xmath8 0 are candidates for enrichment by a truncated r - process .",
    "difficulties in detecting eu in metal - poor stars with [ eu / fe ] @xmath8 0 make it even more challenging to estimate how numerous these stars are .",
    "ba is more easily detected and may be used to represent eu and other heavy elements in stars lacking s - process enrichment . from the ba abundances in the large survey of @xcite we estimate a lower limit of @xmath155% of metal - poor stars as candidates for enrichment by a truncated r - process .",
    "this is significantly higher than the 13% derived above assuming a salpeter imf , yet figure [ ele_abun ] demonstrates that a tr - process may be one way to produce the heavy nuclides observed in some metal - poor stars .",
    "the discrepancy in these fractions could indicate that additional nucleosynthesis channels , such as those proposed by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , together with the tr - process may contribute to the chemical enrichment of the early galaxy .",
    "given that massive stars with short lifetimes will dominate the chemical enrichment at early times , though , the tr - process may very well have been a major source of heavy nuclei at these epochs .",
    "as a possible additional benefit of the tr - process , we note that the stars that were truncated at mass points 28 or less produced no nuclides in the mass 130 peak or beyond .",
    "this would have the effect of boosting the yields of the lighter r - process nuclides relative to the heavier ones , filling in the mass 110 to 120 u region .",
    "it has been known for some time that r - process calculations that produce a mass 195 u peak underproduce the nuclides in the 110 - 120 mass region .",
    "the r - process nuclides that were even lighter than those were underproduced by an even larger factor , but this would also be consistent with distributed cutoffs of the r - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "thus , again guided by the imf , but along with the mass dependent cutoff times , the tr - process might potentially solve this troublesome aspect of current r - process analyses @xcite .",
    "conclusions in this regard , however , must await more detailed analyses .    an obvious test of the tr - process model could occur from renewed effort to observe the higher mass rare earth elements in very metal poor stars with low [ eu / fe ] ratios .",
    "if elements in that mass region can be observed , and the tr - process is correct , additional observations would be expected to map out the black hole collapse times over that region . while no doubt challenging , a relationship between observations and black hole collapse times would be of great interest .",
