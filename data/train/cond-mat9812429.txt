    "recent quantum monte carlo calculations@xcite and calculations at the level of the random - phase approximation@xcite and the fluctuation - exchange approximation @xcite suggest that at the boundary of the antiferromagnetic phase , this model exhibits superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations . as the anisotropy of the intersite hopping varies , the model changes from the square lattice to the isotropic triangular lattice to decoupled chains @xcite .",
    "the wavevector associated with the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations changes and the superconductivity has been predicted to change from d - wave singlet ( as in the cuprates ) to s - wave triplet in the odd - frequency channel for the isotropic triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "this shows that an understanding of the antiferromagnetic interactions is important for understanding the symmetry of the cooper pairs in the superconducting state . as suggested by seo and fukuyama@xcite ,",

    "kanoda@xcite has suggested that the magnetic ordering in @xmath12cl$ ] and @xmath11br$ ] are commensurate .",
    "the magnetic moment has been estimated to be ( 0.4 - 1.0 ) @xmath13 per dimer .",
    "using uniaxial stress within a layer or changing the anion @xmath14 , it may be possible to vary the ratio @xmath1 and induce a quantum phase transition into a disordered phase or the spiral phase discussed here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : mod ] , we introduce the model , before presenting linear - spin wave theory in section [ sec : theo ] . in section [ sec : res ] we present our results .",
    "we find that at @xmath15 quantum fluctuations are enhanced giving a large but finite correction to the magnetization , suggesting the possibility of having a disordered state .",
    "this possibility is also found for @xmath16 : in this region of parameters , the quantum correction to the magnetization is comparable to the classical magnetization and we find that is much larger than for a set of weakly coupled chains with non - frustrated interchain couplings .",
    "we consider the hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice with one electron per site .",
    "if the coulomb repulsion between two electrons on the same site is sufficiently large then the ground state is an insulator and a standard strong - coupling expansion for the hubbard hamiltonian implies that the spin degrees of freedom are described by a spin-@xmath17 heisenberg model @xmath18 we use the notation @xmath19 to denote nearest - neighbours bonds and @xmath20 to denote bonds along the north - east diagonals .",

    "the parameter values in reference suggest that @xmath26 0.3 - 1 in the @xmath4 family and so magnetic frustation will play an important role in these materials .",
    "insight can be gained by considering various limits of this model :    _ classical limit_. the limit of infinite spin ( @xmath27 ) corresponds to a classical heisenberg model .",

    "this ground state configuration was firstly analyzed in @xcite .",

    "there has been some controversy about the ground state of this model .",
    "anderson @xcite originally suggested that the ground state was a `` spin liquid '' with no long - range magnetic order .",
    "however , recent numerical work suggests that there is long - range order but the quantum fluctuations are so large due to magnetic frustation that the magnetic moment may be an order of magnitude smaller than the classical value@xcite . if @xmath21 is non - zero but small we have chains on the diagonals of the lattice that are weakly coupled .",
    "the case of only two chains corresponds to the `` zig - zag '' spin chain which is equivalent to a single chain with nearest - neighbour and next - nearest neighbour exchange , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",

    "one standard and simple way used for calculating the magnetization and energy of the magnetically ordered phases of these systems , is linear spin - wave theory ( lsw ) .",

    "more sophisticated methods , such as the variational approach of huse and elser@xcite have corroborated this fact . in the present work ,",
    "we apply linear spin - wave theory to the model of interest .",
    "recently , bhaumik and bose @xcite considered the linear spin wave theory for the nel phase ( @xmath43 ) of the same model",
    ". however , they did not evaluate the quantum corrections to the magnetization .",
    "following miyake@xcite and singh and huse@xcite , it is convenient to rotate the quantum projection axis of the spins at each site along its classical direction .",
    "this transformation is done by introducing the following rotated spin operators @xmath44 in hamiltonian ( [ qhaf ] ) .",
    "this rotation simplifies the spin - wave treatment so that only one type of bosons rather than three is needed to describe the spin operators . after this transformation",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath45 where we have introduced an auxiliary magnetic field , @xmath46 , in the @xmath47 direction of rotated basis in order to compute the magnetization .    using the standard holstein - primakoff representation@xcite for the spin operators we expand them with respect to @xmath48 and we take the fourier transform of the boson operators .",

    "the ground state energy of the system , @xmath61 , is given by equation ( [ hamilt ] ) , setting the occupation of the bosons to zero , and , finally , the magnetization of the system is computed as the derivative of the ground state energy : @xmath62    this expression recovers the lsw expression for the magnetization on the square lattice@xcite , * q*=(@xmath63 ) , and the isotropic triangular lattice@xcite , @xmath64 .",
    "we have numerically evaluated the integrals in equation ( [ hamilt ] ) and ( [ spin ] ) to obtain the ground state energy and magnetization as a function of @xmath1 .      in fig .",
    "[ energy ] we plot the ground state energy per site as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the classical energy is also included in the same figure ( dashed line ) , showing how quantum fluctuations lower the ground state energy .",
    "the maximum in the total energy is attained around @xmath65 , which approximately coincides with the position of the maximum in the classical energy at @xmath66 : at this point , geometrical frustration attains its maximum .",
    "a cusp is found at the transition from the nel to the spiral phase at @xmath67 , which results , as will be later seen , from the softening of the spin - wave modes at the transition point .",
    "we also plot in the same figure , results for the ground state energy obtained from a series expansion calculation@xcite .",
    "although lsw is a simple approximation for computing ground state properties of frustrated systems , the energies obtained are in good agreement with the series expansion results .",
    "= 10 cm      in fig .  [ magnet ]",
    "we show results for the magnetization for @xmath68 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to those of a recent series expansion study @xcite .",
    "we have tested the accuracy of the calculation by comparing with known results for the square ( @xmath69 ) lattice @xcite with magnetization @xmath70 , and the triangular lattice @xcite ( @xmath1=1.0 ) with @xmath71 .",
    "we find a strong dip in the magnetization at @xmath15 suggesting the possibility of a disordered phase in its neighbourhood .",
    "the nature of the ground state is unclear and will have to be determined by more sophisticated techniques .",
    "it is instructive to mention results reported on other lattices such as the @xmath72 square lattice ( for which there is frustration along both diagonals ) , for which extensive work has been carried out .",
    "schulz , ziman and poilblanc@xcite , using exact diagonalization of finite cells , get results for the magnetization in qualitative agreement with lsw theory and a dyson - maleev approach performed by gochev@xcite which treats the interaction between the spin - waves self - consistently .",
    "however , on the isotropic triangular lattice with next - nearest neighbours , deutscher and everts  @xcite have shown that , while exact diagonalization shows a finite jump of the magnetization between the collinear and the @xmath73 canted phases , lsw theory gives a continuous transition .    from the above discussion",
    "we therefore conclude that it is difficult to extract conclusive answers from lsw theory for this frustated lattice at the transition point : the interaction between the spin - waves becomes very large due to the presence of geometrical frustation leading to the possibility of a completely different state than the classical one and more sophisticated methods are needed to describe this region correctly .",
    "a recent series expansion study @xcite suggests that the system is nel ordered for @xmath74 and quantum disordered for @xmath75 .",
    "insight into the origin of the increase in the quantum fluctuations near @xmath1=0.5 , can be gained from considering the behaviour of the spin - wave velocities near the zero bosonic modes : ( 0,0 ) and @xmath76 . in fig .",
    "[ magnon1 ] , we show the dependence of the magnon frequencies as a function of the wavevector @xmath77 along the @xmath78 direction in the parameter region @xmath79 where the @xmath76 state is classically stable . except at @xmath67",
    "the magnon excitation vanishes linearly with wavevector and we define the associatied spin - wave velocity along the @xmath78 direction as @xmath80 and @xmath81 along the direction perpendicular to it : @xmath82 .    while near the zero modes , ( 0,0 ) and @xmath83 , the spin - wave velocity @xmath84 , @xmath81 does not depend on @xmath22 , @xmath85",
    "hence , the modes soften along the diagonal direction and the velocity @xmath80 vanishes at the nel - spiral transition .",
    "this can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ magnon1 ] .",
    "= 10 cm    from the above analysis we can now explain the behaviour of the low - energy , long - wavelength component of the quantum - fluctuations as @xmath1 approaches 0.5 . at this point and near @xmath86 , the correction to the magnetization due to quantum fluctuations ( see eqn.([spin ] ) ) for @xmath68 can be approximated by @xmath87 where the integral is expressed in terms of the diagonal directions , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is a cutoff in the momentum .",
    "as expected , the lowest order term that appears in the integral along the @xmath91 direction is quartic , because the spin - wave velocity vanishes , @xmath92 .",
    "this behaviour of the magnon spectrum , where the softening occurs only along _",
    "one _ direction , has also been found by chubukov and jolicoeur@xcite on the isotropic triangular lattice with next - nearest neighbours at the transition from the collinear to the incommensurate phase .",
    "they were able to show that the transition point shifts from the lsw theory result when treating the effect of quantum fluctuations in a self - consistent way .",
    "this is in agreement with the results obtained using series expansions @xcite , which give the transition point at @xmath1=0.7 , instead of 0.5 obtained within lsw theory .",
    "as shown in ( [ correc ] ) the integral is _ finite _ but gives a much larger correction than for the square lattice @xmath93 case .",
    "we find that taking a cutoff of @xmath94 , the integral in the correction is two to three times larger than for the square lattice ( @xmath95 ) , for the same region of integration .",
    "therefore , the reduction in energy of the bosonic modes along the @xmath91 direction ( see fig . [ magnon1 ] ) is responsible for a finite but large enhancement of the quantum correction to the magnetization .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result with the one obtained on the @xmath72 square lattice : in this case , the correction due to the quantum fluctuations at @xmath67 , can be approximated by @xmath96 the last integral in eqn.([j1j2 ] ) shows a divergence that behaves like the square of a logarithm .",
    "therefore , we find a different qualitative behaviour of the quantum fluctuations for the anisotropic lattice as compared to the @xmath72 square lattice .",
    "we have analyzed the structure of the magnon excitation spectra in the neighbourhood of the zero bosonic eigenenergies : @xmath98 and @xmath37 , with @xmath99 as @xmath100 .",

    "near the zero modes : @xmath98 , and @xmath37 , it can be approximated by an elliptic integral @xmath103 in the limit @xmath104 , the ratio of velocities diverges as @xmath105 , and the elliptic integral can be approximated by a logarithm .",
    "taking a cut - off of @xmath106 , we get for the magnetization ( eq.[spin ] ) @xmath107 as expected , the quantum fluctuations diverge as @xmath100 . for @xmath68 the critical value that sets",
    "@xmath108 is @xmath109 .",
    "although this is just a crude estimate it is roughly consistent with fig .",
    "[ magnet ] .",

    "the integral reduces to @xmath113 taking a momentum cut - off of @xmath114 .",
    "note that the factor multiplying the logarithm is smaller in this case than in the anisotropic triangular lattice , and , therefore , the critical value obtained , within spin - wave theory , is an order of magnitude larger : @xmath115 .",
    "numerical work@xcite and renormalization group arguments @xcite on the anisotropic square lattice suggests the existence of long range nel order for an infinitesimal coupling between the chains ( @xmath116 ) . a similar renormalization group analysis for the appropiate so(3 ) nonlinear sigma model @xcite ,",
    "could be performed to gain some insight into the ground state of our model in this parameter region .",
    "also numerical calculations using more sophisticated numerical techniques could be performed to find whether long range order persists for an infinitesimal coupling or not .",
