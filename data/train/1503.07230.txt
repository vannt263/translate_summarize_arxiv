    "particles of high - spins @xcite continue being among the most enigmatic challenges in contemporary theoretical physics .",
    "the difficulties in their descriptions , both at the classical- , and the quantum - field theoretical levels , are well known and take their origin from the circumstance that such particles are most naturally described by differential equations of orders twice their respective spins @xcite-@xcite .",
    "higher - order theories are difficult to tackle and various strategies have been elaborated over the years to lower the order of the corresponding differential equations , the linear ones by rarita - schwinger @xcite being the most popular so far .",
    "however , the latter framework is plagued by various inconsistencies , the acausal propagation within an electromagnetic environment @xcite , the violation of unitarity in compton scattering in the ultraviolet in schemes with minimal gauge couplings @xcite , and the violation of lorentz - symmetry upon quantization , being the most serious ones . in parallel , also second order spin-@xmath8 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and spin-@xmath9 @xcite fermion theories have been developed by different authors and shown to provide a reasonable compromise between the rigorous linear and the natural higher - order descriptions in so far as they were able to circumvent , among others , the acausality problem and the related violation of unitarity in compton scattering @xcite .",
    "however , for spins higher than @xmath9 no second order theory has been developed so far .",
    "it is the goal of the present work to fill this gap .",
    "the interest in such a study is motivated by the observation that distinct representation spaces of the lorentz algebra @xmath10 describe particles of different physical properties .",
    "for example , due to the representation dependence of the boost operator , the electromagnetic quadrupole and octupole moments of fundamental particles with spin-@xmath9 transforming in the four - vector spinor come out different from those of particles transforming as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "same holds valid regarding spin-@xmath12 in the four - vector , @xmath13 , versus the anti - symmetric tensor , @xmath14 @xcite . in view of the expected production of new particles in the experiments run by the large hadron collider it is important to have at ones disposal a reliable and comfortable to deal with universal calculation scheme for high spins transforming in carrier spaces of the lorentz algebra different from the totally symmetric tensors of common use , the weinberg - joos states being the prime candidates .",
    "the present study is devoted to the elaboration of such a scheme .",
    "+ the path we take is to embed single spin-@xmath0 weinberg - joos states @xcite-@xcite , @xmath7 , into direct sums of properly selected irreducible @xmath10 representation spaces which join to reducible representation spaces that are large enough as to allow to be equipped by lorentz , and if needed , separate dirac indexes",
    ". then we pin down the state of our interest in a two step procedure .",
    "first we pin down the @xmath1 irreducible representation space by means of a momentum independent ( static ) projector designed on the basis of one of the casimir invariants of the lorentz algebra and then impose on it the klein - gordon equation . in this fashion , a second order formalism for any single - spin valued weinberg- joos state is furnished .",
    "the scheme also allows for an extension to spin-@xmath0 as the highest spins in the two - spin valued representation spaces , @xmath15 .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we formulate the concepts underlying our suggested method . in section iii",
    "we design the calculation algorithm and write down a second order master equation for any single spin-@xmath0 transforming as @xmath7 . in same section",
    "we apply the scheme elaborated to the description of the particular case of spin-@xmath9 . in section",
    "iv we present the spin-@xmath9 lagrangian and couple it to the electromagnetic field , find the electromagnetic current , and calculate the associated electromagnetic multipole moments .",
    "we show that the observables obtained in this fashion reproduce the predictions reported in @xcite where the pure spin-@xmath9 states have been considered in the standard way as eight - dimensional spinors .",
    "also there we show that the pure spin-@xmath9 sector of the antisymmetric tensor spinor describes a particle that propagates causally within an electromagnetic environment .",
    "finally , we calculate the process of compton scattering off @xmath16 and report on a finite differential cross section in forward direction .",
    "the paper closes with brief conclusions and has one appendix .",
    "the method for high - spin description advocated in this work is based upon representation spaces of the lorentz algebra @xmath10 , which are as a rule different from those of common use",
    ". while the representation spaces underlying the weinberg - joos formalism are of non - tensorial nature , those underlying the rarita - schwinger framework are totally symmetric tensors .",
    "our method permits to consider besides totally symmetric also totally antisymmetric lorentz tensors , and also such of mixed symmetries .",
    "our idea is to embed @xmath7 carrier spaces of @xmath10 into finite direct sums of properly chosen dummy irreducible representation spaces with the aim to end up with reducible representation spaces of minimal dimensionality which are nonetheless large enough as to allow to be equipped by lorentz ( and if needed , separate dirac ) indexes , i.e. @xmath17 \\oplus \\sigma _ { ( k , l ) } \\ , n_{(kl ) } \\left [ \\left(j_k , j_l\\right)\\oplus \\left(j_l , j_k\\right)\\right].\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{chudo_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for example , pure spin-@xmath9 can be embedded into the totally antisymmetric tensor of second rank , @xmath18}$ ] , with dirac spinor components , @xmath19 , a representation space that is reducible according to , @xmath20 } & \\simeq&b_{\\left[\\mu\\nu \\right]}\\otimes \\psi\\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq & \\left [ ( 1,0)\\oplus ( 0,1)\\right]\\otimes \\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{2},0\\right)\\oplus \\left(0 , \\frac{1}{2 } \\right ) \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\longrightarrow &     \\left[\\left ( \\mathbf { \\frac{3}{2 } } , { \\mathbf 0}\\right)\\oplus \\left({\\mathbf 0 } , \\mathbf{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\right)\\right]\\oplus   \\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{2},0\\right ) \\oplus \\left(0 , \\frac{1}{2 } \\right)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\oplus & \\left[\\left ( 1,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\oplus \\left(\\frac{1}{2 } , 1 \\right ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\longrightarrow &   \\left[\\left ( \\mathbf { \\frac{3}{2 } } , { \\mathbf 0}\\right)\\oplus \\left({\\mathbf 0 } , \\mathbf{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\right)\\right ] \\oplus \\psi_\\mu,\\nonumber\\\\ \\psi_\\mu & \\simeq &   \\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right ) \\otimes\\left [ \\left(\\frac{1}{2},0 \\right ) \\oplus \\left(0,\\frac{1}{2 } \\right)\\right ] , \\label{tensor_spinor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use @xmath21 $ ] to denote an antisymmetric pair of indexes .",

    "we develop an algorithm on the basis of static projectors constructed from one of the casimir invariants of the lorentz algebra . such projectors have the property to unambiguously identify and exclude anyone of the irreducible representation spaces , no matter whether single- or multiple - spin valued @xcite .",
    "below we outline this representation reduction algorithm .",
    "the lorentz algebra has a casimir operator , denoted by @xmath28 and given in @xcite in terms of the lorentz - group generators , @xmath29 , as @xmath30_{ab}&=&\\frac{1}{4}[m^{{\\mu}{\\nu}}]_a{}^c [ m_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}]_{c b } , \\label{fg_c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the capital latin letters @xmath31,@xmath32 , @xmath33 , ... standing for the generic indexes characterizing the representation space of interest .",
    "its eigenvalue problem for any irreducible representation spaces of the type @xmath34 , with the generic representation functions denoted by , @xmath35 , reads , @xmath36 where @xmath37    on the basis of @xmath28 we design the following momentum independent lorentz projector , @xmath38 , @xmath39w^{(j_k , j_l ) } = w^{(j_1,j_2 ) } , \\label{feq12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 denotes the operation of successive multiplication , @xmath41 is the @xmath28 eigenvalue of the searched sector , @xmath42 , while @xmath43 are the @xmath28 eigenvalues of the dummy sectors , @xmath44 , of the hosting tensor , which need all to be excluded .",
    "the mayor advantage of such projectors is that they are of zeroth order in the momenta , and do not contribute at all to the order of the wave equations . in what follows",
    "we shall mainly consider only such reducible lorentz tensors ( or , tensors - spinors ) which allow the spin-@xmath0 of our interest to reside within one single - spin valued irreducible subspace , @xmath1 , i.e. in @xmath45 however , in the next section we show that the algorithm suggested allows for an extension also toward double - spin valued spaces such as @xmath46 with @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48      the dynamics into the spin-@xmath0 sectors of interest from above is introduced by implementing the mass - shell condition , @xmath49 for the case of single spins transforming as @xmath1 . for double - spin valued representation spaces , the lorentz projector only tracks down the @xmath50 sector as a whole , but does not distinguish between its @xmath51 , and @xmath52 residents . in order to single out , say , the spin-@xmath0 , a different projector , here denoted by @xmath53 , and based on the squared pauli - lubanski vector , has to be employed .",
    "the mass projector , @xmath54 , and the spin-@xmath0 projector , @xmath53 , will be occasionally referred to as `` poincar projectors ''  @xcite in reference to the fact that they express in terms of the casimir invariants of the poincar algebra , the squared four momentum , @xmath55 , and the squared pauli - lubanski vector , @xmath56 , as @xmath57 here , @xmath58 denotes the pauli - lubanski ( pseudo)vector , defined as @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the generators of the lorentz algebra in the representation space of interest , while @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are again as already mentioned above the sets of indexes that characterize the dimensionality of that very representation space .",

    "moreover , differently from the present work , no physical observables have been calculated in @xcite for the sake of a comparison to predictions by other formalisms .",
