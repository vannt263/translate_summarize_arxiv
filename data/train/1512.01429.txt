    "walking is a fundamental activity of human life , not only for moving between places but also in interactions with surrounding environments .",
    "while walking to destinations , pedestrians may be influenced by attractive stimuli such as artworks and shop displays .",
    "some pedestrians may shift their attention to such attractions , opting to stop walking and making an impulse stop to join an attraction  @xcite .    according to previous studies  @xcite",
    ", it has been reported that a growing number of attendees around an attraction are likely to attract more passersby to the attraction , inferring that impulse stopping pedestrians can be affected by others choice .",
    "it has been widely accepted that having more store visitors likely attracts more passerby to the store in that a growing number of visitors increases the possibility of passersby visiting the store .",
    "therefore , marketing strategies have focused on increasing the number of the impulse stopping visitors  @xcite .    by means of numerical simulations ,",
    "we have investigated the impact of impulse stops on pedestrian flow for a straight corridor with multiple attractions .",
    "this study employs the switching behavior model , as shown in the next section . in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we analyze the spatial distribution of the pedestrian flow , characterize the collective patterns , and then summarize the results with a schematic phase diagram . finally , we discuss the findings of this study in the section following the results ( see sect .  [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "similar to the sigmoidal choice rule  @xcite , the probability of joining an attraction @xmath0 is a function of the number of pedestrians who have already joined @xmath1 and the number of pedestrians not stopping by the attraction @xmath2 :    @xmath3    this suggests that larger @xmath1 likely yields higher joining probability . in order to prevent indeterminate cases with @xmath4 ,",
    "two baseline values @xmath5 and @xmath6 are introduced for @xmath1 and @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the strength of the social influence that can be also understood as pedestrians awareness of the attraction .",
    "according to previous studies  @xcite , we assumed that the strength of social influence can be different for different situations and can be controlled in the presented model . after joining the attraction ,",
    "the individual will then stay near the attraction for an exponentially distributed time with an average of @xmath8 , similar to previous works  @xcite .      according to the social force model  @xcite ,",
    "the velocity @xmath9 of pedestrian @xmath10 at time @xmath11 is given by the following equation : @xmath12    here the first term on the right - hand side indicates the driving force describing the tendency of pedestrian @xmath10 moving toward his destination with the desired speed @xmath13 and an unit vector @xmath14 pointing to the desired direction .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath15 controls how fast pedestrian @xmath10 adapts its velocity to the desired velocity .",
    "the repulsive force terms @xmath16 and @xmath17 reflect his tendency to keep certain distance from other pedestrian @xmath18 and the boundary @xmath19 , e.g. , wall and obstacles .",
    "a more detailed description of the pedestrian movement model can be found in previous works  @xcite .",
    "each pedestrian is modeled by a circle with radius @xmath20  m. pedestrians move in a corridor of length 55  m and width 6  m in the horizontal direction .",
    "they move with desired speed @xmath21  m / s and with relaxation time @xmath22  s , and their speed can not exceed @xmath23  m / s . the desired direction points from the left to the right boundary of the corridor for one half of population and the opposite direction for the other half . on the lower wall of the corridor ,",
    "three attractions are placed for every 15  m. the number of pedestrians in the corridor is associated with the pedestrian influx @xmath24 , i.e. , the arrival rate of pedestrians entering the corridor . the pedestrian arrival rate is assumed to follow a shifted exponential distribution @xmath25 with a minimum headway @xmath26  s per unit width based on previous works  @xcite .",
    "the joining probability ( eq .  [ eq : p_a ] ) is updated with the social force model ( eq .  [ eq : eom ] ) for each simulation time step of 0.05  s. the individual can decide whether he will join the attraction when he enters the area of influence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : influencearea ] ) .",
    "the area of influence is defined as a square area of 15  m by 6  m , and its horizontal center coincides with that of the attraction .",
    "once the individual decides to join the attraction , then he shifts his desired direction vector @xmath27 towards the center of the attraction . for simplicity , @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath6 are set to be 1 , meaning that both options are equally attractive when the individual would see nobody within his perception range .",
    "an individual @xmath10 is counted as an attending pedestrian if his efficiency of motion @xmath28 is lower than 0.05 within a range of 4  m from the center of the attraction after he decided to join there ( red circles in the yellow shade area , fig .",
    "[ fig : influencearea ] ) . here",
    "the individual efficiency of motion @xmath29 indicates how much the driving force contributes to the pedestrian @xmath10 s motion with a range from 0 to 1  @xcite .",
    "the average of @xmath30 is set to be 30  s.",
    "for different levels of pedestrian influx @xmath24 , different patterns of pedestrian movement appear . when @xmath24 is low",
    ", one can observe a stable flow where attendees form standstill - like clusters near the attraction and such clusters do not impede pedestrian traffic near the clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots](a ) ) . for large values of @xmath24 ,",
    "an unstable flow can be observed if the value of @xmath31 is large . in the unstable flow ,",
    "pedestrians form swirling clusters in which pedestrians near the attractions are being pushed away from the clusters by other pedestrians .",
    "since increasing @xmath31 makes more passersby head for the attractions , pedestrians tend to rush into the attraction and push others , as shown in fig .",

    "= 0.05 and @xmath31 = 0.2 , and ( b ) an unstable flow with @xmath24 = 0.3 and @xmath31 = 1.2 .",
    "red circles indicate pedestrians attracted by an attraction and blue circles for pedestrians not attracted by the attraction . ]    in order to analyze spatial distribution of the pedestrian flow interacting with attractions , this study evaluates local quantities such as local density and local speed .",
    "following previous studies  @xcite , the local density and local speed are associated with a gaussian distance - dependent weight function @xmath32 : @xmath33    with a parameter @xmath34 .",
    "the local density at a location @xmath35 and time @xmath11 is defined as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the distance between location @xmath38 and pedestrian @xmath10 s position .",
    "likewise , the local speed is given as    @xmath39    for different patterns , figs .",
    "[ fig : heatmap1 ] and [ fig : heatmap2 ] show the local speed maps @xmath40 and the local density maps @xmath41 that have been averaged over the simulation period . in the stable flow , pedestrians form tighter clusters around the attraction as @xmath31 increases , resulting in higher local density and lower local speed around the attractions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : heatmap1 ] ) . in the unstable flow",
    ", one can observe higher local density as @xmath31 increases , similar to the observations from the stable flow .",

    "blue and red colors indicate lower and higher density , respectively .",

    "p / m / s and different values of @xmath31 : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ( from top to bottom ) . ]    in addition to the local quantities , one can better understand the spatial patterns of the pedestrian flow by means of collective quantities such as the collective efficiency of motion @xmath46 and the normalized kinetic energy @xmath47 .",
    "as in previous studies  @xcite , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are measured as :    @xmath48    and    @xmath49    here @xmath50 represents an average over the simulation period after reaching the stationary state .",
    "similar to @xmath51 in the previous section , the collective efficiency reflects the contribution of the driving force in the collective pedestrian motion .",
    "the normalized kinetic energy has the value of @xmath52 if all pedestrians do not move , otherwise it has a positive value .",
    "[ fig : ke ] shows how the collective efficiency @xmath53 and the kinetic energy @xmath54 depend on the social influence strength @xmath31 and the pedestrian influx @xmath24 . for each value of @xmath24",
    ", @xmath46 decreases as @xmath31 increases , indicating that more pedestrians are distracted from their initial destination due to the higher social influence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ke](a ) ) . depending on @xmath24",
    ", @xmath47 reveals two distinct behaviors .",
    "first , for low values of @xmath24 , the decreasing behavior of @xmath47 appears to be similar to that of @xmath46 .",
    "this corresponds to the stable flow that can be characterized by    @xmath55    secondly , for large values of @xmath24 , @xmath47 decreases and then increases as @xmath31 grows , indicating the unstable flow . this case can be characterized by    @xmath56    this reflects that higher @xmath31 yields not only more attendees around attractions but also stronger repulsion among attendees . in this case",
    ", attendees near the attraction can not reach a standstill and they are crowded out from the cluster by other attendees because of interpersonal repulsion .",
    "consequently , expelled attendees from the cluster impede pedestrian flow between the left and right boundaries of the corridor , and thus this parameter region can be called the unstable flow .",
    "those different patterns of pedestrian flow can be summarized in a schematic phase diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .     and ( b ) the normalized kinetic energy @xmath54 .",
    "different symbols represent different levels of @xmath24 .",
    "one can observe that @xmath57 decreases as @xmath31 increases for each given @xmath24 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath58 is similar when the value of @xmath24 is low .",
    "however , @xmath58 decreases and then increase against @xmath31 when @xmath24 is large . ]",
    ", the boundary between the stable and unstable flow . ]",
    "this study has numerically investigated the impact of impulse stops on pedestrian flow by employing the switching behavior model . for low pedestrian influx , one can observe a stable flow in which attendees form standstill - like clusters .",
    "when the pedestrian influx and the social influence strength are high , on the other hand , one can see an unstable flow showing crowded out attendees from the clusters .",
    "consequently , the expelled attendees impede the pedestrian flow near the clusters .",
    "we have also provided a schematic representation of phase diagram as a summary of the study results .",
    "we believe that our study results can provide an insight into the better management of pedestrian facilities where impulse stops may be expected to occur .",
    "for instance , during shopping holidays such as black friday in the united states and singles day in china , the influx of people with extreme desire for merchandise may lead pedestrian incidents .",
    "the existence of the unstable flow suggests that controlling the pedestrian influx for expected level of social influence is necessary for safe and efficient use of pedestrian facilities .",
    "the presented model can be further investigated for various scenarios .",
    "for instance , one can explicitly consider the capacity of the attractions , meaning that only a certain number of attendees can stay near the attractions .",
    "in addition , the length of stay @xmath30 can be associated with the number of attendees near the attractions .",
