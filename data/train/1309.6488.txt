    "jacob bernoulli s theorem was much more than the first instance of what came to be know in later times as the weak law of large numbers ( wlln ) . in modern notation bernoulli showed that , for fixed @xmath1 , any given small positive number @xmath2 , and any given large positive number @xmath3 ( for example @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 may be specified so that : @xmath6 for @xmath7",
    ". the context : @xmath8 is the number of successes in @xmath5 binomial trials relating to sampling with replacement from a collection of @xmath9 items , of which @xmath10 were `` fertile '' and @xmath11 `` sterile '' , so that @xmath12 . @xmath13 was taken as @xmath14 .",
    "his conclusion was that @xmath15 could be taken as the integer greater than or equal to : @xmath16\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\hspace*{20.5pt}\\quad \\frac{\\log c(r-1)}{\\log ( s+1 ) - \\log s } { \\biggl ( } 1 + \\frac{r}{s+1 } { \\biggr ) } - \\frac{r}{s+1 } { \\biggr\\}}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 .",
    "the notation @xmath18 is bernoulli s and the form of the lower bound for @xmath15 is largely his notation .",
    "there is already a clear understanding of the concept of an event as a subset of outcomes , of probability of an event as the proportion of outcomes favourable to the event , and of the binomial distribution : @xmath19 for the number @xmath8 of occurrences of the event in @xmath5 binomial trials .",
    "jacob bernoulli s theorem has two central features .",
    "the first is that the greater the number of observations , the less the uncertainty . that is : in a probabilistic sense later formalized as `` convergence in probability '' , relative frequencies of occurrence of an event in independent repetitions of an experiment approach the probability of occurrence of the event as sample size increases .",
    "it is in this guise that jacob bernoulli s theorem appears as the first _",
    "limit theorem _ of probability theory , and in frequentist mathematical statistics as the notion of a consistent estimator of a parameter ( in this case the parameter @xmath1 ) .",
    "the first central feature also reflects , as a mathematical theorem , the empirically observed `` statistical regularity '' in nature , where independent repetitions of a random experiment under uniform conditions result in observed stability of large sample relative frequency of an event .",
    "the second central feature , less stressed , is that jacob bernoulli s theorem is an _",
    "exact result_. it is tantamount to obtaining a sample size @xmath5 large enough for specified accuracy of approximation of @xmath1 by the proportion @xmath20 .",
    "the lower bound on such @xmath5 may depend on @xmath1 , as it does in jacob bernoulli s theorem , but even if @xmath1 is known , the problem of determining the best possible lower bound for @xmath5 for specified precision is far from straightforward , as we shall demonstrate on one of bernoulli s examples .",
    "bernoulli s underlying motivation was , however , the approximation of an _ unknown _ @xmath1 by @xmath20 on the basis of repeated binomial sampling ( accumulation of evidence ) to specific accuracy . we shall call this the _ inversion _",
    "it adds several layers of complexity to both features .",

    "jacob bernoulli was steeped in calvinism ( although well acquainted with catholic theology ) .",
    "he was thus a firm believer in predestination , as opposed to free will , and hence in determinism in respect of `` random '' phenomena .",
    "this coloured his view on the origins of statistical regularity in nature , and led to its mathematical formalization .",
    "jacob bernoulli s _ ars conjectandi _ remained unfinished in its final ( fourth ) part , the _ pars quarta _ , the part which contains the theorem , at the time of his death .",
    "the unpublished version was reviewed in the _ journal des savans _ in paris , and the review accelerated the ( anonymous ) publication of montmort s _",
    "essay danalyse sur les jeux de hazard _ in 1708 .",
    "nicolaus bernoulli ( 16871759 ) was a nephew to jacob and johann .",
    "his doctorate in law at the university of basel in 1709 , entitled _ de usu artis conjectandi in jure _ , was clearly influenced by a direction towards applications in the draft form of the _ ars conjectandi _ of jacob .",
    "nicolaus s uncle johann , commenting in 1710 on problems in the first edition of 1708 of montmort , facilitated nicolaus s contact with montmort , and seven letters from nicolaus to montmort appear in @xcite , the second edition of the _ essay_. the most important of these as regards our present topic is dated paris , 23 january , 1713 .",
    "it focuses on a lower bound approximation to binomial probabilities in the spirit of jacob s in the _ ars conjectandi _ , but , in contrast , for _ fixed _",
    "@xmath5 .    as a specific illustration , nicolaus asserts ( @xcite , pp .",
    "392393 ) , using modern notation , that if @xmath21 , then @xmath22 @xcite , p. 281 , without mentioning nicolaus anywhere , to illustrate his own approximation , obtains the value @xmath23 so that @xmath24 . the statistical software package * r * which can calculate binomial sum probabilities gives @xmath25 , so that @xmath24 .",
    "the difference in philosophical approach is clear : finding @xmath5 sufficiently large for specific precision ( jacob ) , and finding the degree of precision for given large @xmath5 ( nicolaus ) .",
    "while nicolaus s contribution is a direct bridge to the normal approximation of binomial probabilities for large fixed @xmath5 as taken up by de moivre , it does not enhance the limit theorem direction of jacob bernoulli s theorem , as de moivre s theorem , from which the normal approximation for large @xmath5 to binomial probabilities emerges , was to do .",
    "after paris , in early 1713 at montmort s country estate , nicolaus helped montmort prepare the second edition of his book ( @xcite ) , and returned to basel in april , 1713 , in time to write a preface to _ ars conjectandi _ which appeared in august 1713 , a few months before montmort s ( @xcite ) .",
    "nicolaus , pierre rmond de montmort ( 16781719 ) and abraham de moivre ( 16671754 ) were the three leading figures in what hald ( @xcite ) calls `` the great leap forward '' in stochastics , which is how hald describes the period from 1708 to the first edition of de moivre s ( @xcite ) _ doctrine of chances_.    in his preface to _ ars conjectandi _ in 1713 , nicolaus says of the fourth part that jacob intended to apply what had been exposited in the earlier parts of _ ars conjectandi _ , to civic , moral and economic questions , but due to prolonged illness and untimely onset of death , jacob left it incomplete . describing himself as too young and inexperienced to do this appropriately , nicolaus decided to let the _ ars conjectandi _ be published in the form in which its author left it .",

    "is masked , and the approximating value for sums of binomial probabilities is paramount .    nevertheless , de moivre s results provide a strikingly simple , good , and easy to apply approximation to binomial sums , in terms of an integral of the normal density curve .",

    "he praises laplace s _ thorie analytique _ in respect of its bayesian approach , and applies this approach to multinomial distributions of observations , to obtain in particular probabilities of intervals symmetric about the mean via a normal limiting distribution .",
    "lubbock very likely used the 1820 edition of the _ thorie analytique _ , since his colleague de morgan was in 1837 to review this edition .",
    "de morgan s chief work on probability was , consequently , a lengthy article in the _ encyclopedia metropolitana _ usually cited as of 1845 , but published as separatum in 1837 ( @xcite ) .",

    "it was the first full - length exposition of laplacian theory and the first major work in english on probability theory .",

    "crofton s ( @xcite ) article was likely brought to the attention @xcite of john cook wilson ( 18491915 ) , who in @xcite developed his own relatively simple proof of the limit aspect of `` james bernoulli s theorem '' .",

    ", pearson reproduces the main features of jacob bernoulli s proof , and shows how the normal approximation to the binomial in the manner of de moivre can be used to determine @xmath5 for specified precision _ if @xmath1 is known_. in section 3 , pearson tightens up bernoulli s proof keeping the same expressions for @xmath122 and @xmath123 by using a geometric series bounding procedure and then stirling s theorem .",
    "there is no mention of cook wilson s ( @xcite ) work .",
    "recall that if @xmath124 one problem with the normal approximation to the normal is that asymmetry about its mean of the binomial is not reflected in the normal .",
    "thus in considering @xmath125 involves binomial tails of differing probability size .",
    "a commensurate aspect in @xcite is the treatment of the tails of the binomial distribution individually .",
    "the approximation is remarkably good , giving for bernoulli s example where @xmath126 the result @xmath127 , which is almost the same as for the normal approximation to the binomial ( 6498 ) .",
    "the reason is similar : the use of the de moivre  stirling approximation for @xmath77 , and the fact that @xmath128 is close to @xmath129 , which is the case of symmetric binomial ( when it is known that a correction for continuity such as laplace s with the normal probability function gives very accurate results ) .",
    "pearson does not attempt the inversion ( that is , the determination of @xmath5 when @xmath1 is not known ) in jacob bernoulli s example .",
    "for this classical example when @xmath128 , referring to ( [ pearson1 ] ) , we seek the smallest @xmath5 to satisfy @xmath130 where @xmath131 . using *",

    "chebyshev s ( @xcite ) inequality for inhomogeneous binomial trials , when applied to a homogeneous situation , gives , as we have seen , a much sharper `` exact '' result for minimal @xmath5 ( namely , @xmath137 ) for @xmath128 than bernoulli s , but , like jacob bernoulli s , was incapable of explicit algebraic inversion when @xmath1 was unknown .    in his monograph ( in the 3rd edition , @xcite ,",
    "this is on p. 74 ) markov uses the normal approximation with known @xmath128 in bernoulli s example to obtain that @xmath138 is required for the specified accuracy . in place of @xmath139 . ]    in the tradition of chebyshev , and in the context of his controversy with nekrasov ( see our section 10.1 ) , @xcite had developed a method using continued fractions to obtain tight _ bounds _ for binomial probabilities when @xmath1 is known and @xmath5 is also prespecified . the method is described and illustrated in @xcite , pp .",
    "on p. 74 , @xcite argues that the upper bound @xmath140 on accuracy is likely to hold also for @xmath5 not much greater than the approximative @xmath141 which he had just obtained , say @xmath142 . on pp . 161165",
    "he verifies this , showing that the probability when @xmath142 is between @xmath143 and @xmath144 . using * r *",
    "the true value is 0.9990309 .",
    "thus markov s procedure is an exact procedure for inversion when @xmath1 and accuracy are prespecified , once one has an approximative lower bound for @xmath5 .",
    "one could then proceed experimentally , as we have done using * r * , looking for the smallest @xmath5 .    to effect `` approximative '' inversion _ if we did not know the value of @xmath1 _ , to get the specified accuracy of the _ estimate _ of @xmath1 presuming @xmath5 would still be large , we could use de moivre s theorem and the `` worst case '' bound @xmath145 , to obtain @xmath146 where @xmath147 again the result @xmath148 is good since @xmath128 is not far from the worst case value @xmath129 .",
    "the now commonly used substitution of the estimate @xmath149 from a preliminary performance of the binomial experiment in place of @xmath1 in @xmath150 ( and this is implicit in laplace s use of his add - on correction to the normal to effect inversion ) would improve the inversion result .      the de moivre",
    " laplace approximative methods are based on stirling s approximation for the factorial .",
    "they can be refined by obtaining _",
    "bounds _ for the factorial .",
    "such bounds were already present in an extended footnote in @xcite : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a positive constant .",
    "this was later refined to @xmath153 where @xmath154 .",
    "it was therefore to be expected that de moivre s theorem could be made more precise by producing bounds .",
    "@xcite in the second of two papers ( see seneta ( @xcite ) ) considers the sum @xmath155 over the range @xmath156 for arbitrary fixed @xmath157 , and obtains the bounds for @xmath158 in terms of the normal integral .",
    "a bound for minimal sample size @xmath5 required for specified accuracy of approximation could be determined , at least when @xmath1 was known .",
    "although this work seems to have passed largely unnoticed , it presages the return of `` exact methods '' via bounds on the deviation of normal approximation to the binomial .",
    "these bounds imply a _ convergence rate _ of @xmath159 .",
    "a cycle of related bounding procedures is initiated in @xcite .",
    "he begins by saying that he has not found a rigorous estimate of the accuracy of the normal approximation ( `` laplace s formula '' ) to @xmath160 he illustrates his own investigations by showing when : @xmath27 , @xmath5 is an odd number , and @xmath161 is an integer , that : @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal variable @xmath164 .",
    "he illustrates in the case @xmath165 , so that the right - hand side . ] of ( [ bernstein1 ] )",
    "is @xmath166 .",
    "this value is thus a lower bound for @xmath167 .",
    "@xcite then inverts , by finding that if @xmath168 , then this value normal approximation corresponds to @xmath169 .",
    "this testifies not only to the accuracy of `` laplace s formula '' as approximation , but also to the sharpness of bernstein s bound even for moderate size of @xmath5 , albeit in the very specific situation of @xmath170 .",
    "the accuracy of laplace s formula became a central theme in bernstein s subsequent probabilistic work .",
    "there is a strong thematic connection between bernstein s striking work on _ probabilistic methods _ in approximation theory in those early pre - war years to about 1914 , in kharkov , and de la valle poussin s approximation theory .",
    "see our section 11.3 .",
    "@xcite is a summary paper containing no proofs .",
    "it is dedicated to the memory of chebyshev , on account of nekrasov s continuation of chebyshev s work on central limit theory in it . the author , p.a .",
    "nekrasov ( 18531924 ) , attempted to use what we now call the method of saddle points , of laplacian peaks , and of the lagrange inversion formula , to establish , for sums of independent non - identically distributed lattice random variables , what are now standard local and global limit theorems of central limit theory for large deviations . a follow - up paper , @xcite dealt exclusively with binomial trials .",
    "markov s ( @xcite ) first rigorization , within correspondence with a.v .",
    "vasiliev ( 18531929 ) , of chebyshev s version of the central limit theorem , appeared in the kazan - based journal edited by vasiliev .",
    "the three papers of 1898 mark the beginning of two bitter controversies between nekrasov and markov , details of whose technical and personal interaction are described in @xcite .",
    "nekrasov s writings from about 1898 had become less mathematically focused , partly due to administrative load , and partly due to his use of statistics as a propagandist tool of state and religious authority ( tsarist government and the russian orthodox church ) .    in a long footnote ( @xcite , pp .",
    "2931 ) , states `` chebyshev s theorem '' as follows : if @xmath171 are independently distributed and @xmath172 then @xmath173 where @xmath174 is a given positive number , and @xmath175 he adds that if @xmath176 can be chosen so that @xmath177 while simultaneously @xmath178 , then @xmath179 converges to @xmath180 .",
    "this comment encompasses the lln in its general form at the time .",
    "nekrasov says ( @xcite ) that he has examined the `` theoretical underpinnings of chebyshev s theorem '' , and has come to the [ correct ] conclusion that if in the above @xmath181 is defined as @xmath182 , the inequality continues to hold .",
    "now , in general , @xmath183 so the _ original expression _ for @xmath181 results from just `` pairwise independence '' ( i.e. all @xmath184 .    hence if under merely _ pairwise independence _ @xmath185 can be chosen so that @xmath186 , the lln will hold .",
    "thus ( under this latter condition ) pairwise independence is _ sufficient _ for the lln .",
    "this is an important advance : a first step for the lln to hold under a condition weaker than the hitherto assumed mutual independence .",
    "@xcite , p. 29",
    ", then boldly states that chebyshev s theorem attains its `` _ _ full force _ _ '' under the condition that the @xmath187 are _ pairwise independent_.    there is little doubt from his context that nekrasov is asserting that pairwise independence is _ necessary _ for the lln to hold .",
    "markov saw that this was not correct , and proceeded to construct a counterexample : the first `` markov '' chain ( @xcite ) .",
    "all that was needed was an example of dependence where @xmath188 and @xmath185 is such that @xmath189 , while simultaneously @xmath190 . still publishing in his friend vasiliev s journal , @xcite , sections 2 and 5 , does almost precisely this ( @xcite , section 5 ) .",
    "he constructs in fact , as his _ general scheme of dependent variables _ @xmath191 , a finite markov chain , which he takes to be time homogeneous with all transition probabilities @xmath192 strictly positive .",
    "he shows that @xmath193 has a limit , @xmath52 , as @xmath63 ( that limit is in fact the mean of the limiting - stationary distribution ) , and then uses the bienaym  chebyshev inequality to show that @xmath194 as @xmath63 .",
    "the last sentence of @xcite reads ( without mention of nekrasov ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ thus , independence of quantities does not constitute a necessary condition for the existence of the law of large numbers . _",
