    "although first considered as a source of quantum corrections to the entropy of black holes@xcite , entanglement entropy , in particular the von neumann entropy , evolved into a tool in the field of many - body systems .",

    "flat - band _ hamiltonian @xmath4@xcite .",
    "now , the eigenenergies @xmath5 of the latter are related to the eigenenergies of the corresponding entanglement energies @xmath6 as @xmath7@xcite thereby , the eigenstates of both @xmath4 and @xmath8 are the same . thus , if @xmath3 contains topologically protected surface states the same holds for the entanglement hamiltonian .",
    "this is why the entanglement spectrum , beyond the related entropy , is considered a _ tower of states _ and used as a fingerprint for topological order .",

    "a particular situation arises if the edge comprises the entire remaining subsystem as it is the case for spin ladders @xcite and various bilayer systems @xcite .",
    "a typical observation in such scenarios is , in the regime of strongly coupled subsystems , a proportionality between the energy hamiltonian of the remaining subsystem and the appropriately defined entanglement hamiltonian .",
    "we note that the entanglement hamiltonian entering the reduced density matrix ( [ rhoentham ] ) is only determined up to multiples of the unit operator which has consequences regarding thermodynamic relations between the entanglement entropy and the subsystem energy @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "such a close relation between energy and entanglement hamiltonian is not truly general as shown in ref .   where a spin ladder of clearly nonidentical legs was studied . in the present work we provide another counter example given by graphene bilayers in the presence of trigonal warping @xcite .",

    "the entanglement spectrum obtained from the ground state of undoped graphene bilayers is analyzed in section [ entanglement ] .",
