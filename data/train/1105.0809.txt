    "the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) , in general , addresses the change of temperature of magnetic systems under the adiabatic variation of an external magnetic field which was discovered in iron by warburg in 1881 @xcite .",
    "the mce has been widely used for refrigeration due to potential room - temperature cooling applications @xcite .",
    "for example , adiabatic demagnetization of paramagnetic salts was the first method to reach temperatures below 1k @xcite whereas demagnetization of nuclear spins has reached temperatures down to 100pk @xcite and is still the method of choice for @xmath2k - range cooling @xcite .",
    "the cooling rate at the adiabatic demagnetization @xmath3 for an ideal paramagnet ( i.e. , a system of non - interacting magnetic moments ) is equal to @xmath4 , which means linear monotonic dependence of temperature on strength of the magnetic field .",
    "this linear dependence rise out of a direct consequence of the fact that for any paramagnetic system the entropy depends only on the ratio @xmath4 , so for any isentrope one gets @xmath5 = const .",
    "however , the matter could undergo crucial changes in systems with interacting spins .",
    "for instance , in ferromagnets near the curie point one can observe a substantial enhancement of the effect @xcite .",
    "as has been shown in early investigations , quantum antiferromagnets are more efficient low - temperature magnetic coolers than ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "this fact is connected with the behavior of the entropy of antiferromagnets .",
    "the entropy of any antiferromagnet at low temperatures displays ( at least ) one maximum as a function of magnetic field , which usually , according to the third law of thermodynamics , falls to zero at @xmath6 .    however , the mce in quantum spin systems has recently attracted scientists attention . from one hand ,",
    "field - induced quantum phase transitions lead to universal responses when the applied field is varied adiabatically @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it was observed that the mce is enhanced by geometric frustration @xcite , promising improved efficiency in low - temperature cooling applications .",
    "more generally , the mce is particularly large in the vicinity of quantum critical points ( qcps ) . the mce is closely related to the generalized grneisen ratios _",
    "c=- , where @xmath1 is the control parameter governing the quantum phase transition which would be external magnetic field @xmath7 for mce . using basic thermodynamic relations @xcite ,",
    "the generalized grneisen ratio @xmath8 can be related to the adiabatic cooling rate @xmath9 @xcite _",
    "the magnetic cooling rate is an important quantity for the characterization of quantum critical points ( qcps ) , _ i.e. _ , quantum phase transitions between different magnetic structures under tuning the magnetic field at @xmath10 .",
    "quantum compass model ( qcm ) is simplified model which describes the nature of the orbital states in the case of a twofold degeneracy @xcite .",
    "originally , the qcm has been used to describe the mott insulators with orbit degeneracies .",
    "it depends on the lattice geometry and belongs to the low energy hamiltonian originated from the magnetic interactions in mott - hubbard systems with the strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite . in qcm",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom are represented by pseudospin operators and coupled anisotropically in such a way as to mimic the competition between orbital orderings in different directions . for simplicity , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) qcm ,",
    "is constructed by antiferromagnetic order of @xmath11 and @xmath12 pseudospin components on odd and even bonds , respectively @xcite . moreover , the extended version of the 1d qcm , is obtained by introducing one more tunable parameter , has been studied by eriksson _ et al_. @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "thermodynamic properties of the extended version of 1d qcm in a transverse field has not been studied so far .",
    "since the extended qcm shows two critical lines ( first order and second order transition lines ) , investigation on its thermodynamic properties and mce will be of great importance .",
    "however , in our recent work , we have shown that extended qcm in a transverse field reveals a rich phase diagram which includes several critical surfaces depending on exchange couplings @xcite . in this paper",
    "we exploit the method employed in refs . [ ] and [ ] to investigate thermodynamic properties of extended qcm in absent and presence of a transverse magnetic field .",

    "the crucial step is to define independent majorana fermions @xcite at site @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this can be regarded as quasiparticles spin or as splitting the chain into bi - atomic elementary cells @xcite .    substituting for @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) in terms of majorana fermions with antiperiodic boundary condition ( subspace with even number of fermions ) followed by a fourier transformation , hamiltonian eq .",
