    "materials exhibiting commensurately and incommensurately structurally modulated phases were extensively investigated during the last years .",
    "bccd , @xmath0 , is an outstanding example : it shows a rich variety of phases , and exhibits many intricate phenomena in its phase diagram , such as indications for accumulation points of structure branchings , and the so - called dielectric @xmath1-anomaly @xcite .",
    "the problem of the modulation and its temperature - dependence still poses many open questions .",
    "the plenitude of experimental results led to a continuing theoretical interest , and many different models for their explanation have been developed ( for reviews see references @xcite ) .",
    "we recently used the concept of symmetry - adapted local modes @xcite to derive the double ising spin ( dis ) model @xcite as a symmetry - based pseudo spin model with two two - component pseudo spin variables per crystallographic unit cell : the symmetry - breaking atomic displacements occuring at the transition from the high - temperature ( high - symmetry ) para phase to the modulated phases at lower temperatures are expanded in terms of an appropriately chosen basis set , and the pseudo spin components @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the signs of the relevant coordinates @xcite . in the case of materials with high - temperature phase space group @xmath4 ( e.g.  bccd ) , this approach yields the hamiltonian of the dis model @xcite : @xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 label the pseudo spin positions along the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11-directions respectively . at @xmath12 ,",
    "the in - layer couplings @xmath13 lead to a ferro - ordering of the layers perpendicular to @xmath14 . in @xmath14-direction ,",
    "frustrations and therefore modulations arise because of the antagonistic effects of the symmetric nearest neighbour interactions @xmath15 and @xmath16 on the one hand and the antisymmetric interaction @xmath17 on the other hand . the stable structures ( pseudo spin profiles ) obtained from the statistical mechanics treatment of @xmath18 are characterized by their wave numbers @xmath19 given in units of @xmath20(pseudo spin spacing ) .",
    "at @xmath21 , five stable phases are separated by multiphase lines in the @xmath22-@xmath23-plane . along these lines ,",
    "an infinity of different phases are degenerate . we restrict ourselves to ferroelectric @xmath2-@xmath2-interactions , i.e.  @xmath24 ; the phase diagram for @xmath25",
    "is obtained by exploiting the properties of @xmath18 . in the following",
    ", we will consider the multiphase lines ( a ) and ( b ) separating , in the notation of reference @xcite , phase v ( the pseudo spin structure repeats itself after four layers ) , from the ferroelectric phase i ( all @xmath2- and @xmath3-spins in ferro - order ) and the mixed phase iii ( @xmath2-spins in ferro- , @xmath3-spins in antiferro - order along @xmath11 ) respectively .    for low temperatures ,",
    "all phases degenerate at line ( a ) ( with @xmath24 and @xmath26 ) and obeying some rules have a finite stability range in the vicinity of this line @xcite .",
    " incidentally , this also holds for the four - state chiral clock model which can be derived from the dis model for the case @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , in the vicinity of line ( b ) ( with @xmath24 and @xmath29 ) only four different phases ( characterized by the wave numbers @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ) are stable at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "other phases are created at higher temperatures by structure combination branching processes .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report on a remarkable type of transitions in the dis model for the case @xmath24 and @xmath34 : these ` internal ' transitions occuring at certain temperatures @xmath35 are characterized by a structural change in the pseudo spin arrangement which is not accompanied by a change of @xmath19 and  in some cases  not even by a change of the symmetries of the profile .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section :",
    "mfa ] , the pseudo spin profiles calculated in mean field approximation ( mfa ) are discussed .",
    "the results are substantiated in section [ section : validation ] by employing the mean field transfer matrix method and monte carlo simulations , which prove that these transitions are no artefacts of mfa . in section [ section :",
    "bccd ] , the internal transition in the @xmath36-phase of the dis model is used to explain a dielectric anomaly in the fourfold phase of bccd as well as seemingly contradictory experimental structure analysis results .",
    "section [ section : discussion ] contains a summarizing discussion .",
    "the mean field approximation is often used for analysing the finite temperature behaviour of pseudo spin models .",
    "starting point is the variational hamiltonian @xmath37 for systems with a modulation in @xmath38-direction , with @xmath39 .",
    "the product @xmath40 describes the interaction of the spin @xmath41 ( which in our case has two components ) with a site - dependent mean field @xmath42 depending on the averages of the neighbouring spins .",
    "the mean values @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the pseudo spins @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the layer @xmath45 are determined by the mfa equilibrium equations ( @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 with the mean fields @xmath48 figure [ figure : figure1 ] shows a typical mean field phase diagram in the plane @xmath49 , @xmath50 , where we have introduced the reduced interaction parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; @xmath53 denotes the reduced temperature .",
    "the shaded areas contain incommensurate and higher order commensurate phases .",
    "the different commensurate phases are characterized by their wave numbers .",
    "para phase , ferro phase and modulated phases meet at the lifshitz point ( lp ) . at @xmath54",
    "the considered cut through the temperature - interaction phase diagram intersects the multiphase line at the multiphase point mp .    the existence of accumulation points of structure branchings in the case @xmath24 and @xmath34 was verified @xcite by formulating the mean field equilibrium equations ( [ equation : mfaeq ] ) as a four - dimensional mapping and using a fixed - point technique analogous to that employed for the annni model @xcite .",
    "also calculated were the self- and the interaction - energies of discommensurations .    as a consequence of the signs of the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath55",
    "( i.e.  @xmath24 , @xmath34 , and @xmath17 ) , all phases degenerate at the multiphase line ( b ) consist of bands of two types of two - layer sequences viz .",

    "we introduce a bracketed notation @xmath56 for the different phases : for example , @xmath57 denotes a repetitive pseudo spin structure consisting of a band with two ( ) sequences followed by a band with three ( ) sequences .",
    "the wave number for the above phase is @xmath58 the equilibrium pseudo spin profiles for configurations with a fixed wave number @xmath19 at a given temperature are obtained by finding the self - consistent solutions of the equations ( [ equation : mfaeq ] ) .",
    "this is done by starting from different initial spin configurations with the same modulation period and iterating .",
    "the respective free energies are calculated and the solution with the lowest free energy describes the stable spin configuration . keeping @xmath59 ,",
    "@xmath7 , and @xmath60 fixed , the reduced parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 are then varied in such a way that the resulting line @xmath63 always lies wholly in the stability region of the phase under investigation .",
    "figure [ figure : figure2 ] shows the obtained spin profiles for the phases @xmath64 ( wave number @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) with @xmath68 and @xmath69 . for both wave numbers",
    "there is a discontinuous internal phase transition . at higher temperatures",
    ", the @xmath65-phase exhibits also a continuous transition to a modification with two disordered layers .",
    "the obtained spin profiles for the @xmath66-phase ( for layers 1 to 8 , i.e.  for one modulation period ) exhibit symmetries given by    * at low temperatures : @xmath70 * at high temperatures : @xmath71    at a reduced temperature @xmath72 the @xmath3-spins averages change signs in layers 2 , 3 , 6 and 7 , whereas the symmetry elements of the spin profiles are left unchanged .",
    "furthermore , also the @xmath2-spins ( in all layers ) show discontinuities at @xmath72 .    for the @xmath64-phase ,",
    "the spin profiles in the vicinity of the discontinuous transition are :    * at low temperatures : @xmath73 * at high temperatures : @xmath74    in this case the @xmath2-spins in layer 3 ( and the @xmath3-spins in layers 4 and 5 ) change signs , leading to a change of the symmetries of the profile .    in general not all combinations of the signs of the spins",
    "were taken as possible starting points for solving the equilibrium equations self - consistently .",
    "however , we substantiated our results for selected values of the parameters by considering all @xmath75 ( phase @xmath64 ) or @xmath76 ( phase @xmath66 ) possible sign combinations ( changing the signs of all spins leaves the free energy unchanged ) .    in order to characterize the different modifications , a fourier analysis of the spatial modulation of @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "was performed . in the following ,",
    "the results for the @xmath67-phase are discussed , as they will be needed for the application to bccd in section [ section : bccd ] . for reduced temperatures slightly below ( @xmath79 ) and above ( @xmath80 ) the reduced temperature @xmath72 of the internal transition ,",
    "the pseudo spin averages ( profiles ) for one period of the spatial modulation are shown in figure [ figure : profile ] together with their harmonics . due to the symmetries in the pseudo spin profiles , the fourier components of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 )",
    "are all odd ( even ) about @xmath81 , and only odd orders in sine ( cosine ) occur in the fourier series : @xmath82 ) + a_3 \\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{4 } [ \\ell-\\frac{1}{2}])\\\\ \\label{equation : harms } s_\\ell & = & b_1 \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4 } [ \\ell-\\frac{1}{2 } ] ) + b_3 \\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{4 } [ \\ell-\\frac{1}{2}]).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] upon cooling ( see figure [ figure : harmonics ] ) , the relative strength of the third order harmonic with respect to the first order harmonic increases smoothly from zero near the transition to the para phase to about one third near @xmath72 ( both for the @xmath83- and @xmath84-profiles ) .",
    "when dropping below @xmath72 , only a slight increase in @xmath85 and @xmath86 but remarkable changes in @xmath87 and @xmath88 occur : @xmath88 jumps from @xmath89 at @xmath80 to @xmath90 at @xmath79 while @xmath91 decreases from @xmath92 to @xmath93 . below @xmath72 ,",
    "the @xmath84-profile is governed by the strong third order harmonic ( @xmath94 ) , which continuously increases to the ground state value @xmath95 , whereas the first harmonic keeps its nearly constant value @xmath96 .    in mfa",
    ", these discontinuous internal phase transitions were obtained for all investigated phases of the dis model , execpting only the @xmath97- and the @xmath98- ( ferro ) phases .",
    "they occur for all values of @xmath59 and @xmath99 as long as @xmath100 and @xmath101 , as well as for all in - layer couplings @xmath7 and @xmath60 ( even for very large values ) .",
    "in the previous section , the dis model was treated in the mean field approximation .",
    "the question arises whether the observed internal transitions are an artefact of this approximation or if they are also present if one goes beyond mean field theory .",
    "this problem should indeed be considered : in mfa , the axial next nearest neighbour ising ( annni ) model @xcite with weak in - layer couplings exhibits , for example , phase transitions from the low temperature phases to high temperature asymmetric and partially disordered phases @xcite .",
    "nakanishi @xcite could show that these phases are mfa artefacts by demonstrating that they do not occur if the mean field transfer matrix ( mftm ) method is used , in which the interactions in direction of the modulations are treated exactly .",
    "the same conclusion was drawn from monte carlo simulations @xcite .    in the mftm method ,",
    "the variational hamiltonian for the dis model is @xmath102 in the mfa variational hamiltonian ( [ equation : dis ] ) all interactions are described by mean fields . in contrast , in equation ( [ equation : hmftm ] ) site - dependent mean fields are only introduced for the interactions perpendicular to the direction of modulation .",
    "as the two - component mean fields @xmath42 do not depend on the indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 the problem is reduced to one dimension and the indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 will be omitted .    using the bogoliubov variational principle ,",
    "the mftm free energy is given by @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105 ,   @xmath106 ,   @xmath107 and @xmath108 ,   @xmath109 . in order to calculate the partition function @xmath110 we introduce the transfer matrix @xmath111 for a commensurate phase with period @xmath112 the mean fields repeat themselves after @xmath112 layers .",
    "the partition function ( [ equation : mftmpart ] ) is then given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix product @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the number of layers in the crystal .",
    "the mean values @xmath77 and @xmath78 are calculated by @xmath117 @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the left and the right eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath114 , whereas the matrices @xmath120 and @xmath121 are given by    @xmath122    the mean fields @xmath123 result from the minimization of the free energy ( [ equation : mftmfree ] ) . equations ( [ equation : mftmeq ] ) and ( [ equation : mftmfield ] ) are to be solved self - consistently .    as an example , we will discuss the application of this method to the @xmath67 phase .",
    "calculations in mean field approximation ( see previous section ) yield a first order phase transition at @xmath72 between a low- and a high - temperature modification ( figure [ figure : figure2 ] ) .",
    "these two spin profiles are used as starting points for the self - consistent solution of the mftm equations ( [ equation : mftmeq ] ) and ( [ equation : mftmfield ] ) .    figure [ figure : figure5 ] shows the resulting free energies obtained by varying the model parameters in the same manner as in the previous section , i.e.  one proceeds along the same @xmath124-curve as for the mfa calculations .",
    "it is clearly seen that the free energy curves of the two modifications intersect at @xmath125 , yielding a first - order phase transition .",
    "as expected , the temperature @xmath72 is slightly shifted to lower temperatures as compared to the mfa result .    in the mftm method",
    "some pseudo spin interactions , though not those in modulation direction ( which should be the most important ones ) , are still replaced by an interaction of the pseudo spins with a mean field . to make sure that this approximation is not responsible for the occurrence of internal phase transitions ,",
    "monte carlo simulations were performed for phases with a short modulation length .",
    "no attempt was made to determine the global phase diagram .",
    "systems of sizes @xmath126 were simulated , with @xmath16 ranging from 10 to 40 .",
    "the number of layers , @xmath55 , is given by the modulation length of the phase under investigation , e.g.  @xmath127 for the @xmath65-phase .",
    "this is done in order to avoid the development of fluctuations resulting from ( meta)stable phases with a larger modulation length .",
    "the standard one  spin  flip metropolis algorithm is used .",
    "figure [ figure : figure6 ] shows the calculated specific heat as a function of the reduced temperature for the @xmath65-phase , for interactions given by @xmath49 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 and a size of @xmath130 .",
    "there are two different peaks .",
    "the peak at higher temperatures corresponds to a second order phase transition to the disordered phase . in the present context ,",
    "the narrow peak is the interesting one .",
    "it corresponds to the internal first order phase transition .",
    "the resulting spin profiles for temperatures below and above the peak position compare favorably with the profiles obtained in mfa . in the inset showing the calculated energy the discontinuous character of the internal phase transition is clearly visible .",
    "due to the pseudo symmetry of half a lattice constant along @xmath131 , bccd can be considered to be built up of successive layers of half cells perpendicular to @xmath131 , which we label by the subscript @xmath45 . applying the method described in reference @xcite to bccd",
    ", the symmetry - breaking atomic displacements occuring below the transition from the unmodulated high - temperature phase to the modulated phases are expanded in terms of a localized symmetry - adapted basis set ; the respective coordinates ( mode amplitudes ) are projected onto two - valued pseudo spin variables leading to symmetry - based pseudo spin models .",
    "every basis vector ( symmetry - adapted local mode , salm ) describes a collective displacement of all atoms in a half cell .",
    "one obtains two relevant salms for the front and two for the back half cell .",
    "adequate superpositions of these describe structural modulations transforming according to the irreducible representations @xmath132 and @xmath133 of the group of the wave vector @xmath134 ( antisymmetric with respect to the mirror plane ) .",
    "the pseudo spins @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the signs of the amplitudes of the two relevant salms . for convenience , we shall henceforth call the latter , @xmath2-salm and , @xmath3-salm. previously @xcite , we deduced the displacements corresponding to the @xmath2- and the @xmath3-salms for all bccd atoms from experimental data @xcite . for a complete visualization of these salm displacements",
    "it is sufficient to follow the @xmath135-displacements of the nitrogen atoms .",
    "consider the two nitrogen atoms 1 and 2 associated to a half cell .",
    "the major part of their @xmath135-displacements is provided by the @xmath2-salm contributions ( equal for 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the @xmath3-salm contributions ( of equal sizes but opposite signs for 1 and 2 ) account for the small relative @xmath135-displacement of 1 and 2 .",
    "taking the transformation properties of the salms into account , the form ( [ equation : dis ] ) of the pseudo spin hamiltonian is obtained as well as expressions for the spontaneous polarization in terms of the pseudo spins @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations of the pressure - temperature ( @xmath112-@xmath136 ) phase diagram of bccd @xcite revealed a dielectric anomaly in the modulated phase with wave vector @xmath137 .",
    "it occurs along a line @xmath138 , which runs almost parallel to the boundary of the para phase and to the lines of constant spontaneous polarization @xmath139 . at ambient pressure",
    ", @xmath1 practically coincides with the upper boundary of the fourfold phase .",
    "the @xmath1-anomaly exhibits the characteristics of a first order phase transition ; it leaves the wave number unchanged .",
    "one proposal for the explanation of the @xmath1-anomaly was to interpret it as a freezing of the soliton lattice @xcite , i.e.  to assume that the soliton lattice is free to move above @xmath1 and is pinned below .",
    "since the wave number @xmath8 in bccd is measured in units of the reciprocal lattice constant , whereas the wave number @xmath19 in the dis model is given in units of the reciprocal layer spacing , the @xmath140-phase in bccd corresponds to the @xmath36-phase in the dis formalism .",
    "for the latter the occurence of an internal transition was explicitely shown in sections [ section : mfa ] and [ section : validation ] above .",
    "it suggests itself to interpret the @xmath1-anomaly as a manifestation of the internal transition observed in the dis model .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the following results :    in the same way as the @xmath1-line in bccd , the @xmath35-line runs parallel to the boundary of the high - temperature phase and parallel to the lines of constant spontaneous polarization @xcite @xmath141 $ ] .",
    "there is an interesting connection with experimental studies on the structure of the fourfold phase in bccd :    the displacement of atom @xmath142 in cell @xmath143 can be written as ( e.g.  reference @xcite ) @xmath144,\\ ] ] where the zeroeth order harmonics are absorbed in the average positions @xmath145 of @xmath142 with respect to the origin of the cell .",
    "there are only odd harmonics due to the symmetry of the @xmath140-phase in bccd . a comparison of the symmetries of the eigenvectors @xmath146 and @xmath147 for odd @xmath148 and of the @xmath2-salm and the @xmath3-salm shows that the @xmath149 and @xmath150 terms in ( [ equation : amf ] ) correspond to the @xmath83- and @xmath84-profile respectively @xcite .",
    "recent neutron scattering studies @xcite of the fourfold phase in bccd at @xmath151 and ambient pressure ( see figure [ figure : hypo]a ) , i.e.  below @xmath152 , revealed a strong third harmonic in the @xmath150 terms in ( [ equation : amf ] ) .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the structure of the low temperature modification in the dis model as derived in sections [ section : mfa ] and [ section : validation ] .",
    "x - ray techniques @xcite showed a more sinusoidal modulation ( @xmath153 , ambient pressure ) , which can be well described as the high temperature modification in the dis model , i.e.  the one that is expected to be stable above @xmath1 .    these seemingly contradictory experimental results can be explained if the influence of point defects on the phase diagram and recent experiments on intentionally x - ray - irradiated samples are taken into consideration .",
    "exposure to x - rays  even to doses used normally in diffractometry @xcite  produces radiation damage , which is sufficient to cause an observable lattice expansion .",
    "the effect is comparable to doping with bromine ions .",
    "the resulting ( positive ) plastic strains shift the boundaries in the @xmath112-@xmath136-phase diagram to higher pressures / lower temperatures .",
    "it was experimentally observed , that this shift is stronger for the @xmath1-line than for the other phase boundaries @xcite .",
    "this leads to the situation described schematically in figure [ figure : hypo]b : the irradiation defects induced by the x - ray measurements produce different shifts of the @xmath1-line and the other boundaries and thus open up a window for the observation of the high temperature modification of the @xmath140-phase at ambient pressure .    for a more quantitative comparison of the structures predicted by the symmetry - based dis model with the atomic displacements observed either by x - ray or by neutron measurements , we derived the amplitudes @xmath154 and @xmath155 in a decomposition of the structural modulation in the fourfold phase of bccd in terms of the @xmath2- and @xmath3-salms ( see figure [ figure : bccdprofile ] ) from the experimental data given in references @xcite . in the employed procedure @xcite , @xmath154 and @xmath155",
    "are proportional to @xmath77 and @xmath78 in linear approximation .",
    "@xmath154 and @xmath155 can be written in terms of first and third order harmonics as in equations  ( [ equation : harmt ] ) and ( [ equation : harms ] ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath156 , @xmath157 from the x - ray data @xcite and @xmath158 , @xmath159 from the neutron results @xcite .",
    "similar values can be found in the dis model for temperatures not too far above ( e.g.  @xmath160 : @xmath161 , @xmath162 ) or below @xmath72 ( e.g.  @xmath163 : @xmath164 , @xmath165 ) respectively .",
    "it is noteworthy that even with the parameters ( @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) which were rather arbitrarily chosen in this comparison and which probably do not represent the optimal choice ( e.g.  by the methods discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for bccd , we find a good agreement between theoretical prediction and experimental observation .",
    "recent theoretical developments in the field of modulated systems allow , in a physically well motivated way , to bridge the gap between pseudo spin model - parameters and -properties on the one hand , and experimental control parameters and physical characteristics of real systems on the other .    an efficient pseudo spin model , which is well suited as a basis both for largely analytical calculations and for numerical simulations , is the dis model . it can advantageously be used for the theoretical description of a large class of modulated materials . since the model variables are explicitely related to local properties of the discrete crystal lattice",
    ", it allows explicit predictions e.g.  of structures , symmetries , spontaneous polarizations , phase diagrams , and orders of transitions of modulated phases in real systems .",
    "a special feature of the dis model is that it predicts phase transitions not only between modulated structures with different wave numbers , but also between modulations with the same wave number but different pseudo spin configurations ( ` internal ' phase transitions ) .",
    "the respective phases differ significantly in the amplitudes of the harmonics in a fourier expansion of the pseudo spin profiles and in symmetry .",
    "since remotely similar theoretical results derived for the annni model were later shown to be artefacts of the employed mean field approximation , we verified the validity of our mfa results both by means of the mean field transfer matrix method and by monte carlo simulations .",
    "one indication of the suitability of the symmetry - based dis model for the description even of detailed characteristics of complex modulated real systems is the proposed explanation of the dielectric anomaly @xmath1 observed in the fourfold phase of bccd : this anomaly and its characteristic properties can be well interpreted as a realization of the internal phase transitions of the dis model .",
    "furthermore , an application of the general procedure for translating model properties to characteristics of real , experimentally investigated systems allows a tentative explanation of discrepancies between experimental structure determinations of the fourfold phase of bccd by neutrons on the one hand and by x - rays on the other . taking the influence of x - ray induced defects ( via the strain field ) into account",
    ", we propose a mechanism which allows the high temperature modification of the fourfold phase ( which exists in ideal crystals only at elevated pressure ) to become stable already at ambient pressure and , thus , be visible in x - ray measurements .",
    "the two experimentally determined structures of the fourfold phase agree fairly well with our calculated data .",
