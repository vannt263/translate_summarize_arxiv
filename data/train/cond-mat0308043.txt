    "in living brains , information is carried by spikes which propagate from one cortical area to another area .",
    "it has been controversial how information is coded in spikes ( for review , see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "one possibility is that information is coded in the number of spikes within a short time window ( _ rate code _ ) @xcite . indeed , firing activities of motor and sensory neurons have been reported to vary in response to applied stimuli . in an alternative _ temporal code _",
    ", on the contrary , information is assumed to be carried by precise firing times of neurons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of problems in the rate coding is that a fairly long time of tens of milliseconds are required to read out the rate for typical firings rate of 10 - 100 hz .",
    "however , human visual systems , for example , have been reported to quickly classify patterns within 250 ms despite the fact that at lest ten synaptic stages are involved from retina to the temporal brain : transmission times between the two successive stages are no more than 10 ms on the average @xcite .",
    "a possible mechanism to speed up reading of firing rate may be to collect spikes of many independent neurons in a population ( _ population code _ ) @xcite@xcite , where many parallel neurons perform the same task with the inefficient , high redundancy .",
    "on the other hand , one of problems in the temporal coding is that spikes are vulnerable to noise while the rate coding performs robustly but inefficiently .",
    "these issues on coding have been theoretically studied in a single neuron ensemble .",
    "it is not clear whether these conclusions may be applied to multilayer architectures relevant to cortical processing .",
    "studies with the use of multiunit recordings of frontal cortex of monkeys have shown that a spatiotemporal pattern of highly synchronous firings can propagate through several tens of synaptic connections @xcite .",
    "a simple model accounting for this phenomenon is a feedforward synfire chain first proposed by abeles @xcite .",
    "since the synfire chain model was proposed , many studies have been made on its properties @xcite-@xcite . in the rate coding ,",
    "neurons in each layer are expected to fire in uncorrelated manner with other neurons in the same layer .",
    "neurons in a given layer are assumed to compute the average firing rate of the neurons in the previous layer in order to generate the output rate which is related to the input rate . in a feedforward network , however , this firing may propagate to the next layer in synchronous way @xcite , which is detrimental for the rate code .",
    "diesmann , gewaltig and aertsen @xcite have shown by simulations of integrate - and - fire ( if ) neuron model that a pulse packet can propagate through the synfire chain if a packet satisfies the condition which is specified by the two parameters : one is the number of spikes in a pulse packet and the other is the root - mean - square ( rms ) value of firing times in a pulse packet . the result of diesmann et al .",
    "@xcite has been confirmed by the method of fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "it has been not clear whether feedforward networks support the rate - code or temporal - code hypothesis .",
    "shadlen and newsome @xcite have claimed the feasibility of the rate code , adopting a model in which excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are assumed to be balanced . because of this balanced input , postsynaptic potentials fluctuate around the resting potential , which yields random firings in output neurons .",
    "it has been shown that if each pair of output neurons shares less than 40 percent of input neurons , only a small degree of synchrony will be developed , which assures an feasibility of the rate code .",
    "the efficiency of the rate code transmission in unbalanced feedforward networks has been also studied @xcite .",
    "quite recently , however , it has been pointed out that in _ long _ feedforward networks , input firing rate can not be transmitted reliably because the mean firings rate in a deep layer is independent of input firing rate @xcite .",
    "studies on feedforward networks have been so far made mostly by direct simulations for networks described by the simplest if model .",
    "it is worthwhile to make a more detailed study on feedforward multilayers by employing more realistic neuron model with an analytical method besides simulations . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite ( referred to i hereafter ) , we have developed the semi - analytical dynamical mean - field approximation ( dma ) theory as an efficient tool dealing with large - scale fitzhugh - nagumo ( fn ) neuron ensembles subject to noises @xcite@xcite , by extending the moment method @xcite .",
    "original @xmath5-dimensional stochastic differential equations ( des ) for a @xmath6-unit fn neuron ensemble are transformed to @xmath7-dimensional deterministic des for means , variances and covariances of local and global variables .",
    "recently dma has been successfully applied to neuron ensembles described by the realistic hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) model @xcite@xcite .",
    "the fn neuron model adopted in i for a feedforward network is obtainable by a simplification of the hh model @xcite@xcite , and it is expected to be more realistic than if model . we have investigated in i , the spike propagation through the network , taking no account of the spatial correlation . experimentally , correlated firings have been observed in a variety of neurons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the correlation coefficient between cells is about 0.12 in v5 of a rhesus monkey @xcite , 0.1 - 0.3 in human motor units of muscles @xcite , and about 0.3 in cat s lateral geniculate nucleus ( lgn ) @xcite and in retinal ganglion cells of rabbits @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies on the input correlation have shown that it may yield a significant effect on the firing rate and the variability of outputs @xcite-@xcite .",
    "calculations with the use of if model have shown that the firing rate of outputs is increased with increasing the input correlation for low firing rates of inputs but is decreased for their high firing rates @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the variability of output spikes of if model is an increasing function of the input correlation , whereas that of hh model is a decreasing function of the input correlation @xcite .",
    "these studies have been made for a single neuron ensemble @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we expect that the spatial correlation plays an important role also in multilayer networks .",
    "although some theoretical studies have investigated the cross - correlation of spike rates averaged over long times @xcite , there have been no calculations of the firing - time correlation in multilayers , as far as the author is concerned .",
    "we have developed , in i , a new method calculating the instantaneous synchronization ratio in neuron ensembles which is expressed in terms of variances of local and global variables [ eq . ( 58 ) ] .",
    "as will be shown shortly , the calculated correlation in multilayers with all - to - all feedforward couplings subject to weak noises is developed to a fairly large value as spikes propagate , even for inputs without the correlation . in order",
    "that the correlation remains in the range of the observed value of 0.1 - 0.3 mentioned above@xcite-@xcite , we have to take into account at least two factors : one is the more detailed connectivity in feedforward couplings besides the all - to - all coupling and the other is noises .",
    "as for the first issue , we have assumed , in this study , that our multilayer network includes , besides all - to - all couplings , local couplings in which each neuron in a given layer receives an input from one neuron in the preceding layer .",
    "all - to - all and local couplings are superimposed with fractions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , where @xmath8 denotes a parameter expressing a degree of all - to - all component in the total feedforward couplings . as for the second issue ,",
    "several conceivable sources of noises have been reported : ( i ) cells in sensory neurons are exposed to noisy outer world , ( ii ) ion channels of the membrane of neurons and synaptic transmission by a release of synaptic vesicles are essentially stochastic , and ( iii ) synaptic inputs include leaked currents from neighboring neurons . in this study , we have taken account of white noises which are independently added to all neurons . applying spike inputs to the first layer of the network with the spatial correlation in input - time jitters",
    ", we have investigated the effect of the spatial correlation in multilayer with all - to - all and local feedforward couplings subject to independent noises .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we will discuss an adopted multilayer with feedforward couplings . by using dma , the rms value ( @xmath2 ) and the correlation ( @xmath3 ) of jitters in output firing times at layer @xmath4 are expressed as functions of the rms value ( @xmath0 ) and the correlation ( @xmath1 ) of jitters in input times . in sec .",
