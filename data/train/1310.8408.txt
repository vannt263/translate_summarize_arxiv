    "a sequential program can usually be thought of as computing a partial function from the set of possible inputs to the set of possible outputs .",
    "sometimes the program is not assumed to be deterministic , in which case its meaning is not a partial function but a more general relation .",
    "it is widely agreed that relations from inputs to outputs are usually the most appropriate class of mathematical objects for modelling the semantics of sequential programs at the abstract level .",
    "two programs are equivalent if and only if they compute the same relation .    the situation is entirely different with concurrent systems .",
    "process algebra researchers have introduced numerous abstract equivalence notions for comparing the behaviours of systems or subsystems .",
    "many are surveyed in  @xcite .",
    "it is desirable that an equivalence is a congruence , that is , if a subsystem is replaced by an equivalent subsystem , then the system as a whole remains equivalent .",
    "whether or not an equivalence is a congruence depends on the set of operators used in building systems from subsystems .",
    "although the congruence requirement narrows the range down , there is no consensus about which abstract congruence is the most appropriate . indeed , the abstract congruence that is best for some purpose is not necessarily the best for another purpose .",
    "behaviours of ( sub)systems are often represented as _ labelled transition systems _ , abbreviated _",
    "lts_. the congruence property makes it possible to apply reductions to subsystems or their ltss , and thus construct a reduced lts of the system as a whole that is equivalent to the full lts of the system but often much smaller .",
    "this _ compositional _",
    "approach is a key ingredient in many advanced process - algebraic verification methods , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "we say that `` @xmath0 '' _ implies _",
    "`` @xmath1 '' , if and only if @xmath2 implies @xmath3 for every @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we say that `` @xmath0 '' is _ weaker _ ( or coarser ) than `` @xmath1 '' , if and only if `` @xmath1 '' implies `` @xmath0 '' but not vice versa . we say that `` @xmath6 '' _ preserves _ a property , if and only if @xmath7 implies that either none or both of @xmath4 and @xmath5 have the property .",
    "if , for instance , `` @xmath6 '' preserves deadlocks , @xmath4 is complicated , @xmath5 is simple , and we can reason that @xmath7 , then we can analyse the deadlocks of @xmath4 by analysing the deadlocks of @xmath5 . on the other hand , if `` @xmath6 '' also preserves some other information ( say , livelocks ) about which @xmath4 and @xmath5 disagree , then @xmath8 . in that case , we can not use @xmath5 to analyse the deadlocks of @xmath4 because we can not reason that @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we would ideally like to use the weakest possible deadlock - preserving congruence in this analysis task .    finding the weakest congruence that preserves a given property has been tedious .",
    "a handful of such results has been published ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , but if none of them directly matches , then the user is more or less left with empty hands .",
    "furthermore , to fully exploit the weakest congruence , reduction algorithms have to be adapted to it .",
    "the prospect of rewriting the reduction tools for each property is not attractive .",
    "this publication shows that for a significant set of properties and widely accepted set of process operators , the situation is not that bad .",
    "this publication simplifies the selection of the abstract congruence that is most appropriate for a task , by listing _ all _ abstract congruences within a reasonably wide region with respect to a reasonable set of operators .",
    "the operators are parallel composition , hiding , relational renaming , and action prefix .",
    "the list will make it easy to answer such questions as `` what is the weakest congruence that distinguishes @xmath9(4,2){{\\psline[linearc=2]{->}}(-4,8)(-0.9,1.8)}}{\\psline[linearc=2]{->}}(6,2)(18,2)\\rput[b](12,4){$a$}{\\pscircle[fillcolor = white]}(4,2){2}{\\pscircle[fillcolor = white]}(20,2){2 } \\end{pspicture}}$ ] from @xmath10(18,2){{\\psline[linearc=2]{->}}(-4,8)(-0.9,1.8 ) } } { \\psline[linearc=2]{->}}(16,2)(4,2)\\rput[b](10,4){$\\tau$}{\\psline[linearc=2]{->}}(20,2)(32,2)\\rput[b](26,4){$a$ } { \\pscircle[fillcolor = white]}(2,2){2}{\\pscircle[fillcolor = white]}(18,2){2}{\\pscircle[fillcolor = white]}(34,2){2 } \\end{pspicture}}$ ] ? ''    by _ abstract _ we mean that invisible actions are not directly observable , although they may have indirect observable consequences . in the vocabulary of linear temporal logic  @xcite , we only consider stuttering - insensitive properties .",
    "it is generally accepted that this is a reasonable restriction in the case of concurrent systems .",
    "basically all process - algebraic verification methods make it .",
    "the region that we cover is abstract _ linear - time _",
    "congruences , in the following sense .",
    "a linear - time property holds or fails to hold on an individual complete execution of the system .",
    "the system has the property if and only if all its complete executions have it .",
    "we originally only consider the execution of visible actions , deadlock , and livelock as directly observable .",
    "then the congruence requirement will bring so - called refusal sets into consideration in the end , but not in the middle , of a sequence of visible actions .",
    "the modern version  @xcite of hoare s csp- or failures - divergences equivalence  @xcite is within our scope , while milner s observation equivalence or weak bisimilarity  @xcite is not .",
    "our notion of linear - time is slightly more general than that of the famous stuttering - insensitive linear temporal logic of  @xcite .",
    "this is because we do but the logic does not distinguish deadlock from livelock .",
    "the congruence that matches the logic precisely will be found in section  [ s : blisll ] . on the other hand",
    ", we will see in section  [ s : cffd ] that our notion of linear - time is less general than another line of thought yields .",
    "two results of this kind were discussed in chapters  11 and  12 of  @xcite . with the csp set of operators and a certain notion of finite linear - time observations , there are only three congruences .",
    "therefore , if the given property meets that notion , to find the weakest congruence that preserves it , it suffices to test the three congruences . if also infinite behaviour is observable , another set of only three congruences",
    "is obtained .",
    "our range covers 40 congruences .",
    "four of them are the same as in  @xcite and two are trivial .",
    "the remaining 34 are obtained because we cover a different set of properties and use a smaller set of operators than  @xcite .",
    "the additional two congruences in  @xcite assume the ability to also observe refusal sets in the middle of a trace .",
    "this publication is based on  @xcite .",
    "the former solved the problem for finite ltss , finding 20 congruences .",
    "the case of infinite ltss was analysed in  @xcite .",
    "some of the earlier congruences were split into two and some into three , so the number grew to 40 . in  @xcite and this publication , we concentrate on proving that there are no other congruences than those that we discuss , and skip the proofs that they indeed are congruences .",
    "section  [ s : def ] presents the background definitions .",
    "section  [ s : cffd ] introduces the strongest abstract linear - time congruence ( in our sense ) .",
    "congruences that are weaker than it are found in sections  [ s : dlisll ] to  [ s : blisll ] .",
    "finally section  [ s : conclusion ] summarizes the publication .",
    "in this publication , systems are composed of labelled transition systems using the action prefix , hiding , relational renaming , and parallel composition operators . in this section",
    "we define these and some related concepts , including bisimilarity .",
    "we reserve the symbol @xmath11 to denote so - called invisible actions .",
    "labelled transition system _ or _ lts _ is the tuple @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
