    "systems with a complex time evolution , which generate a great impact event from time to time , are ubiquitous .",
    "examples include fluctuations of prices for financial assets in economy with rare market crashes , electrical activity of human brain with rare epileptic seizures , seismic activity of the earth with rare earthquakes , changing weather conditions with rare disastrous storms , and also fluctuations of online diagnostics of technical machinery and networks with rare breakdowns or blackouts .",
    "due to the complexity of the systems mentioned , a complete modeling is usually impossible , either due to the huge number of degrees of freedom involved , or due to a lack of precise knowledge about the governing equations .",
    "this is why one applies the framework of prediction via precursory structures for such cases .",
    "the typical application for prediction with precursory structures is a prediction of an event which occurs in the very near future , i.e. , on short timescales compared to the lifetime of the system .",
    "a classical example for the search for precursory structures is the prediction of earthquakes @xcite .",

    ", we studied the quality of predictions analytically via precursory structures for increments in an ar(1 ) process and numerically in a long - range correlated arma process .",
    "the long - range correlations did not alter the general findings for gaussian processes , namely , that larger events are better predictable .",

    "this approach is also motivated by the book of egans @xcite which explains that receiver operator characteristics ( roc ) obtained in signal detection problems can be ordered families of functions in dependence on a parameter .",

    "the considerations in this section are made for a time series @xcite , i.e.  , a set of measurements @xmath0 at discrete times @xmath1 , where @xmath2 with a sampling interval @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the recording should contain sufficiently many extreme events so that we are able to extract statistical information about them .",
    "we also assume that the event of interest can be identified on the basis of the observations , e.g. by the value of the observation function exceeding some threshold , by a sudden increase , or by its variance exceeding some threshold .",
    "we express the presence ( absence ) of an event by using a binary variable @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6      when we consider prediction via precursory structures ( _ precursors _ , or _ predictors _ ) , we are typically in a situation where we assume that the dynamics of the system under study has both , a deterministic and a stochastic part .",
    "the deterministic part allows one to assume that there is a relation between the event and its precursory structure which we can use for predictive purposes .",
    "however , if the dynamic of the system was fully deterministic there would be no need to predict via precursory structures , but we could exploit our knowledge about the dynamical system as it is done , e.g. , in weather forecasting .    in this contribution",
    "we focus on the influence of the stochastic part of the dynamics and assume therefore a very simple deterministic correlation between event and precursor.the presence of this stochastic part determines that we can not expect the precursor to preced _ every _ individual event .",
    "that is why we define a precursor in this context as a data structure which is _ typically _ preceding an event , allowing deviations from the given structure , but also allowing events without preceeding structure .    for reasons of simplicity",
    "the following considerations are made for precursors in real space , i.e. , structures in the time series .",
    "however , there is no reason not to apply the same ideas for precursory structures , which live in phase space .",
    "in order to predict an event @xmath5 occurring at the time @xmath7 we compare the last @xmath8 observations , to which we will refer as the _ precursory variable _",
    "@xmath9 with a specific precursory structure @xmath10 once the precursory structure @xmath11 is determined , we give an alarm for an event @xmath12 when we find the precursory variable @xmath13 inside the volume @xmath14 there are different strategies to identify suitable precursory structures .",
    "we choose the precursor via maximizing a conditional probability which we refer to as the _ likelihood _ @xcite .. and the term _ aposterior pdf _ for the probability to find a precursor @xmath15 before of an already observed extreme event .",
    "note that the names might be also used vice versa , if one refers to the precursor as the previously observed information . ]",
    "the likelihood @xmath16 provides the probability that an event @xmath12 follows the precursor @xmath13 .",
    "it can be calculated numerically by using the joint pdf @xmath17 .",
    "our prediction strategy consists of determining those values of each component @xmath18 of @xmath13 for which the likelihood is maximal .",
    "this strategy to identify the optimal precursor represents a rather fundamental choice . in more applied examples",
    "one looks for precursors which minimize or maximize more sophisticated quantities , e.g. , discriminant functions or loss matrices .",
    "these quantities are usually functions of the posterior pdf or the likelihood , but they take into account the additional demands of the specific problem , e.g. , minimizing the loss due to a false prediction .",
    "the strategy studied in this contribution is thus fundamental in the sense that it enters into many of the more sophisticated quantities which were used for predictions and decision making .",
    "a common method to verify a hypothesis or to test the quality of a prediction is the receiver operating characteristic curve ( roc ) @xcite .",
    "the idea of the roc consists simply of comparing the rate of correctly predicted events @xmath19 with the rate of false alarms @xmath20 by plotting @xmath21 vs.  @xmath22 .",
    "the rate of correct predictions @xmath21 and the rate of false alarms @xmath22 can be obtained by integrating the _ aposterior _ pdfs @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the precursory volume . @xmath25",
    "note that these rates are defined with respect to the total numbers of events @xmath12 and nonevents @xmath26 .",
    "thus the relative frequency of events has no direct influence on the roc , unlike on other measures of predictability , as e.g. , the brier score or the ignorance@xcite .",
    "plotting @xmath21 vs @xmath22 for increasing values of @xmath27 one obtains a curve in the unit - square of the @xmath22-@xmath21 plane ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : rocgauss ] ) .",
    "the curve approaches the origin for @xmath28 and the point @xmath29 in the limit @xmath30 , where @xmath27 accounts for the magnitude of the precursory volume @xmath31 .",
    "the shape of the curve characterizes the significance of the prediction .",
    "a curve above the diagonal reveals that the corresponding strategy of prediction is better than a random prediction which is characterized by the diagonal .",
    "furthermore we are interested in curves which converge as fast as possible to @xmath32 , since this scenario tells us that we reach the highest possible rate of correct prediction without having a large rate of false alarms .",
    "that is why we use the so - called _ likelihood ratio _ as a summary index , to quantify the roc . for our inference problems",
    "the likelihood ratio is identical to the slope @xmath33 of the roc - curve at the vicinity of the origin which implies @xmath34 .",
    "this region of the roc is in particular interesting , since it corresponds to a low rate of false alarms .",
    "the term likelihood ratio results from signal detection theory . in the context of signal detection theory",
    ", the term _ a posterior pdf _ refers to the pdf , which we call likelihood in the context of predictions and vice versa .",
    "this is due to the fact that the aim of signal detection is to identify a signal which was already observed in the past , whereas predictions are made about future events .",
    "thus the likelihood ratio \" is in our notation a ratio of a posterior pdfs .",
    "@xmath35 however , we will use the common name likelihood ratio throughout the text . for other problems",
    "the name likelihood ratio is also used for the slope at every point of the roc .",
    "since we apply the likelihood ratio as a summary index for roc , we specify , that for our purposes the term likelihood ratio refers only to the slope of the roc curve at the vicinity of the origin as in eq .",
    "( [ defm ] ) .",
    "note , that one can show that the precursor , which maximizes the likelihood as explained in sec .",
    "[ pre ] also maximizes the @xmath33 and is in this sense the optimal precursor .",
    "we are now interested in learning how the predictability depends on the event magnitude @xmath36 which is measured in units of the standard deviation of the time series under study .",
    "thus the event variable @xmath5 becomes dependent on the event magnitude @xmath37    via bayes theorem the likelihood ratio can be expressed in terms of the likelihood @xmath38 and the total probability to find events @xmath39 . inserting the technical details of the calculation of the likelihood and the total probability ( see the appendix ) we can see that the likelihood ratio depends sensitively on the joint pdf @xmath40 of pecursory variable and event .",
    "@xmath41    hence once the precursor is chosen , the dependence on the event magnitude @xmath36 enters into the likelihood ratio , via the joint pdf of event and precursor .",
    "looking at the rather technical formula in eq .",
    "( [ mgeneral ] ) , there are two aspects , which we find remarkable :    * the slope of the roc curve is fully characterized by the knowledge of the joint pdf of precursory variable and event .",
    "this implies that in the framework of statistical predictions all kinds of ( long - range ) correlations which might be present in the time series influence the quality of the predictions only through their influence on the joint pdf .",
    "* the definition of the event , e.g. , as a threshold crossing or an increment does change this dependence only insofar as it enters into the choice of the precursor and it influences also the set on which the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ mgeneral ] ) are carried out . both @xmath42 and the set @xmath43 have to be defined according to the type of events one predicts .",

    "one uses @xmath49 , @xmath50 .    exploiting eq .",
    "( [ mgeneral ] ) we can hence determine the dependence of the likelihood ratio and the roc curve on the events magnitude @xmath36 , via the dependence of the joint pdf of the process under study .      in order to study the dependence of the likelihood ratio on the event magnitude we are going to introduce a constraint which the likelihood and the total probability to find events have to fulfill in order to find a better predictability of larger ( smaller ) events .    in order to improve the readability of the paper",
    ", we will first introduce the following notations for the aposterior pdfs , the likelihood and the total probability to find events @xmath51 we can then ask for the change of the likelihood ratio with changing event magnitude @xmath36 . @xmath52 the derivative of the likelihood ratio is positive ( negative , zero ) , if the following sufficient condition @xmath53 is fulfilled .    @xmath54    hence one can tell for an arbitrary process , if extreme events are better predictable , by simply testing , if the marginal pdf of the event and the likelihood of event and precursor fulfill eq .",
    "( [ c2b ] ) .",
    "in this section we test the condition @xmath55 as given in eq .",
    "( [ c2b ] ) for increments in gaussian , power - law , and exponentially distributed i.i.d .",
    "random numbers .",
    "we thus concentrate on extreme events which consist of a sudden increase ( or decrease ) of the observed variable within a few time steps",
    ". examples of this kind of extreme events are the increases in wind speed in @xcite , but also stock market crashes @xcite which consist of sudden decreases .",
    "we define our extreme event by an increment @xmath56 exceeding a given threshold @xmath36 @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath48 denote the observed values at two consecutive time steps and the event magnitude @xmath36 is again measured in units of the standard deviation .    since the first part of the increment @xmath0 can be used as a precursory variable , the definition of the event as an increment introduces a correlation between the event and the precursory variable @xmath0 .",
    "hence the prediction of increments in random numbers provides a simple , but not unrealistic example which allows us to study the influence of the distribution of the underlying process on the event - magnitude dependence of the quality of prediction .    in the examples which we study in this section the joint pdf of precursory variable and event",
    "is known and we can hence evaluate @xmath59 analytically . a mathematical expression for a filter which selects the pdf of our extreme events out of the pdfs of the underlying stochastic process can be obtained through applying the heaviside function @xmath60 to the joint pdf .",
    "this method is described in more detail in the appendix .    since in most cases the structure of the pdf",
    "is not known analytically , we are also interested in evaluating @xmath61 numerically . in this case the approximations of the total probability and the likelihood are obtained by binning and counting \" and their numerical derivatives are evaluated via a savitzky - golay filter @xcite .",
    "the numerical evaluation is done within @xmath62 data points . in order to check the stability of this procedure , we evaluate @xmath59 also on @xmath63 bootstrap samples which are generated from the original data set .",
    "these bootstrap samples consist of @xmath62 pairs of event and precursory variable , which were drawn randomly from the original data set .",
    "thus their pdfs are slightly different in their first and second moment and they contain different numbers of events . evaluating @xmath64 on the bootstrap samples thus shows how sensitive our numerical evaluation procedure is towards changes in the numbers of events .",
    "this is especially important for large and therefore rare events .    in order to check the results obtained by the evaluation of @xmath61 , we compute also the corresponding rocs analytically and numerically .    note that for both , the numerical evaluation of the condition and the roc curves , we used only event magnitudes @xmath36 for which we found at least @xmath65 events , so that the observed effects are not due to a lack of statistics of the large events .      in the first example we assume the sequence of i.i.d .",

    "<S> we evaluate this dependence on the probability distribution function analytically and numerically . if we assume that the optimal precursory structures are used to make the predictions , we find that large increments are better predictable if the underlying stochastic process has a gaussian probability distribution function , whereas larger increments are harder to predict if the underlying probability distribution function has a power law tail . in the case of an exponential distribution function </S>",
    "<S> we find no significant dependence on the event magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we compare these results with predictions of increments in correlated data , namely , velocity increments of a free jet flow . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity increments in the free jet flow are in dependence on the time scale either asymptotically gaussian or asymptotically exponential distributed . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results for predictions within free jet data are in good agreement with the previous analytical considerations for random numbers . </S>"
