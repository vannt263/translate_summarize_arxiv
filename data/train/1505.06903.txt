    "recent observations , such as those of the cosmic background radiation , show that @xmath2 cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) cosmology is remarkably consistent with observations , although some tensions remain , see  @xcite and references therein . on the other hand ,",
    "the unknown origins and nature of dark matter and dark energy remain mysteries which generate a steady flow of models and theories .",
    "nonetheless , current observations should be taken seriously , and viable cosmological models should therefore presumably only deviate from @xmath2cdm cosmology marginally .",
    "moreover , although successful , the @xmath2cdm model still needs to be observationally tested , which suggests that it should be continuously deformed .",
    "in addition , for a variety of reasons , it is of interest to consider a dynamical dark energy content described by a field theoretical model instead of a cosmological constant @xmath2 or a dark energy fluid .",
    "this leads to the question : what phenomenological conditions must be imposed on an effective classical field description of dark energy to continuously deform @xmath2cdm cosmology for an open set of observationally viable solutions ?",
    "although observational compatibility arguably comes first , there also exist other issues that are of interest such as various fine - tuning problems and if there exist observationally viable models that emerge from , or at least have ties to , a fundamental theory . the rather modest purpose of this paper ,",
    "however , is to    * describe general features and determine asymptotic behavior of flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models with a perfect fluid and a scalar field @xmath0 , minimally coupled to gravity , with a positive monotonic potential @xmath3 , * shed some light on the above `` observationally viable field theoretical @xmath2cdm - deformation issue '' by considering some simple models of the above type with the equation of state for the perfect fluid specialized to dust , representing nonrelativistic matter ( mainly baryons and nonbaryonic dark matter ) .",
    "since the literature about minimally coupled scalar fields and a perfect fluid in a flat flrw spacetime geometry is vast , we will start with only a few general sample references : the influential papers  @xcite and the recent review  @xcite , and references therein .",
    "it is of interest for discussions and future purposes to first consider a perfect fluid with a general barotropic equation of state @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pressure and energy density , respectively , and @xmath7 , together with a scalar field @xmath0 , minimally coupled to gravity , with a self - interaction potential @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the einstein and matter field equations for the present flat flrw models can be written as ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite )    [ hphieq ] @xmath8    where @xmath9 and where overdots denote derivatives with respect to cosmic time @xmath10 .",
    "units are such that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the gravitational constant and @xmath13 the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "it is assumed throughout the paper that the universe is expanding , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "equation   can be heuristically interpreted as an equation for a particle of unit mass with a one - dimensional coordinate @xmath0 , moving in a potential @xmath3 with a friction force @xmath15 .",
    "equation   shows that @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of @xmath0 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . introducing @xmath17 as an independent variable therefore leads to a three - dimensional dynamical system for @xmath19 .",
    "alternatively one can solve eq .   to obtain @xmath20 and consider the variables @xmath0 , @xmath21 as the dependent variables , where @xmath22 obeys the equation @xmath23 , where @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of @xmath24 by means of  .",
    "it is of some interest to introduce effective equation of state parameters , defined by @xmath25 or , alternatively , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , where    @xmath28    adding a cosmological constant to a perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of state can be regarded as a problem with a single fluid with a changed barotropic equation of state . replacing a cosmological constant in a general barotropic fluid description with a scalar field",
    "therefore adds the dynamical degrees of freedom , @xmath0 and @xmath17 , to @xmath18 ( or @xmath22 ) , which implies a complication , since this leads to a larger set of solutions with different histories . in the context of @xmath2cdm deformations",
    "this problem is somewhat alleviated by the following assumption : to obtain an evolutionary history such that primordial nucleosynthesis gives observationally compatible light nuclear abundances , we will assume that there exists a mechanism such as inflation that sets initial conditions for the present models at high redshifts so that the matter content greatly dominates over the scalar field ( dark energy ) content in the early universe .    for simplicity we will from now on consider a linear equation of state with a constant @xmath29 restricted to the range @xmath30 , which avoids bifurcations at @xmath31 , corresponding to a cosmological constant , and @xmath32 , which yields a stiff perfect fluid with the speed of sound equal to the speed of light ; @xmath33 corresponds to a fluid without pressure , which will be the focus when describing and discussing @xmath2cdm deformations , while @xmath34 corresponds to a radiation fluid .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "that @xmath35 furthermore , most of the scalar field potentials that have been considered as possible alternatives to a cosmological constant as dark energy have strictly monotonic scalar field potentials , as exemplified by , e.g. , the popular inverse power - law potential .",
    "apart from the model with @xmath36 , we will therefore assume that @xmath37 is defined , differentiable , positive , and strictly monotone for @xmath38 .",
    "without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath37 is monotonically decreasing .",
    "we also assume that the potential is such that @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath40 is finite or @xmath41 depends on how fast @xmath3 increases when @xmath42 , e.g. , for an inverse power - law potential , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , while an exponential potential , @xmath45 , leads to @xmath46 .",
    "a constant or monotonically strictly decreasing potential makes it convenient to use a particular type of dynamical systems formulation that brings @xmath47 into focus , where @xmath48 is zero for a constant potential and positive for @xmath49 when @xmath3 is strictly monotonically decreasing . within this context",
    "it is natural to regard @xmath48 as more `` fundamental '' than @xmath37 itself , where @xmath37 is obtained from @xmath50 via @xmath51 in the special case where @xmath48 and @xmath52 are bounded it follows that the potential can be bounded by an exponential and therefore @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath48 is unbounded , as in the case of an inverse power - law potential , @xmath40 is finite .",
    "finally we note that the system   has unbounded variables and right - hand sides that blow up .",
    "it is therefore not suitable for a global or asymptotic analysis of the solution space and its properties .",
    "below we will therefore make a change of variables in order to obtain a dynamical system on a compact state space that allows these issues to be addressed , as well as giving global illustrative pictures of the entire solution spaces of the models under consideration .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section we ( i )",
    "formulate the dynamical systems approach that is used throughout the paper to deal with a fluid and a minimally coupled scalar field ; ( ii ) describe the state space features ; ( iii ) point out some global properties and determine asymptotic behavior for models with a perfect fluid and a scalar field such that @xmath54 , @xmath49 , and @xmath55 where @xmath56 is finite and @xmath57 is finite or @xmath58 .    in sec .",

[",
    "sec : dynlambda ] we turn from the previous `` frozen @xmath48 '' models to some `` dynamical @xmath48 '' models .",
    "we consider ( i ) the inverse power - law potentials , characterized by @xmath61 , in a global dynamical systems setting , tying local results to the global features discussed in sec .",

    "finally , the section is concluded with ( iii ) a general discussion about observational viability conditions that @xmath48 should satisfy for _ any _ potential that might arise from some fundamental theory .    throughout",
    "we use dynamical systems pictures which clearly display general key features , and , in order to compare with @xmath2cdm cosmology , these pictures are complemented by diagrams that indicate the evolutionary history of physically important quantities .",
    "finally , we outline how it is possible to treat two fluids , e.g. dust and radiation , and a scalar field in the appendix .",
    "the presently used dynamical systems formulation is based on the following dependent variables , @xmath67 these variables are by no means suitable for all scalar field potentials , e.g. , for potentials with a zero minimum such as monomial potentials it is advisable to replace the scalar field variable @xmath68 with an @xmath16-based variable that takes into account a varying averaged oscillatory time scale at late times , as done in  @xcite . nevertheless , the above variables",
    "are useful for positive monotonic potentials .",
    "an optimal choice of the variable @xmath69 depends on the potential that is studied .",
    "however , to obtain a suitable global dynamical systems formulation @xmath68 should always be chosen to be a globally invertible monotone function in @xmath0 , defined on a _ bounded _",
    "interval @xmath70 , @xmath71 ; without loss of generality , we choose @xmath68 to be monotonically increasing in @xmath0 so that @xmath72 for @xmath70 .",
    "apart from the dependent variables we also need to choose a new time variable . in order to obtain a regular dynamical system",
    "this choice depends on if @xmath48 is bounded or not . in the case",
    "@xmath48 is bounded , as exemplified by , e.g. , exponentially bounded potentials , it is convenient to use @xmath73 , defined by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 sometimes is referred to as @xmath76 , the number of @xmath77-folds from a reference time @xmath78 [ @xmath79 , which for the present time leads to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the redshift . thus , the field equations can be written as the following coupled system :    [ dynsys0 ] @xmath82\\omega_m,\\label{omeq}\\\\ z^\\prime & = \\sqrt{6}\\frac{dz}{d\\phi}\\,x,\\label{zeq0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath83 denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath84 . with some slight abuse of notation",
    "we have written @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , the gauss constraint   is used to globally express the hubble - normalized scalar field potential energy , @xmath86 , in terms of the state space variables : @xmath87 while the deceleration parameter @xmath88 , defined via @xmath89 , is given by @xmath90 the above system is suitable when @xmath48 is bounded , but not when @xmath91 , as exemplified by , e.g. , inverse power - law potentials . in order to obtain a regular dynamical system when @xmath91 we therefore choose a new time variable @xmath92 , defined by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a suitable positive bounded function of @xmath68 such that @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where , e.g. , @xmath98 is a suitable choice for inverse power - law potentials .",
    "this results in the system    [ dynsysz ] @xmath99\\omega_m,\\label{omeqg}\\\\ \\frac{dz}{d\\bar{\\tau } } & = \\sqrt{6}g(z)\\frac{dz}{d\\phi}\\,x.\\label{zeq0g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that   is obtained by setting @xmath100 , hence @xmath101 , and so the above system formally covers both cases .",
    "the above assumptions lead to the following domain for the state vector @xmath102 for the _ interior state space _",
    "@xmath103 for models with a perfect fluid and a scalar field : @xmath104 furthermore , it follows from  , and the following auxiliary equation for @xmath86 , @xmath105 that it is possible to extend the state space and include the following boundaries :    * the boundary @xmath106 ( i.e. @xmath107 ) yields the ( pure ) _ scalar field boundary subset _ [ see eq .  ] , and thus @xmath108 with an interior state space @xmath109 given by @xmath110 , @xmath111 . * the boundary @xmath112 corresponds to a model with a perfect fluid and a massless scalar field ; we refer to this subset as the _ massless scalar field boundary subset_. note that this boundary also contains the pure massless scalar field boundary subset @xmath106 , @xmath113 , and the _ perfect fluid boundary subset _ @xmath114 ( @xmath115 , i.e. , @xmath116 ) , which is described by a line of fixed points , @xmath117 , with constant @xmath68 . *",
    "in addition we assume that the potential and @xmath68 are such that the state space @xmath103 can be extended to not only include the boundaries @xmath106 , @xmath118 , but also the boundaries @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which furthermore are assumed to constitute invariant boundary subsets .",
    "thus the _ extended compact state spaces _ @xmath121 and @xmath122 are characterized by    @xmath123    respectively , and the dynamical systems on @xmath121 and @xmath124 are of differentiability class @xmath125 or higher .",
    "we therefore assume that the potential is such that it is possible to find a scalar field variable @xmath68 and , if needed , a function @xmath94 so that    * @xmath126 _ and _ @xmath127 are bounded and differentiable on the extended interval @xmath128 $ ] , * ) @xmath129 , i.e. , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are invariant boundary subsets .",
    "although the above restrictive assumptions require that the potential @xmath3 is of differentiability class @xmath130 , they cover a vast class of potentials @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the extended state space treatment of the admissible class of potentials can be used to provide bounds on asymptotic behavior of potentials that do not admit @xmath68-extended state spaces , and thus they provide a natural starting point for very general situations .",
    "it should also be noted that for many qualitative dynamical aspects , as will be seen , there is no need to state any more information about @xmath69 or @xmath3 , although quantitative treatments of course need specific functions and thus we will give specific examples when dealing with continuous @xmath2cdm deformations .    to physically compare solutions that are obtained in the dynamical systems approach with @xmath2cdm cosmology",
    ", we will complement the state space description with diagrams involving physically important quantities .",
    "apart from the physically important state space variable @xmath131 we have given the deceleration parameter @xmath88 in terms of state space variables in eq .  , and",
    "below we will also express @xmath16 in state space variables .",
    "in addition it is of interest to give the jerk parameter @xmath132",
    "@xcite , since even though the observational feasibility of @xmath132 is questionable , it is still useful in order to theoretically compare models with @xmath2cdm cosmology for which @xmath133 ; for constant @xmath29 the jerk parameter is given by @xmath134 next we turn to structures that are helpful when it comes to determining global and asymptotic state space features .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath16 , or more conveniently @xmath135 , can be expressed in the state space variables in @xmath103 and @xmath109 and is given by @xmath136 as follows from the definition of @xmath86 .",
    "this has far - reaching consequences for the global dynamics due to @xmath137 since eqs .   and   lead to @xmath138 which together with @xmath30 yield @xmath139 as will be seen , the above inequalities for @xmath88 , induced by energy and causality conditions , play a central role for the dynamics , which strongly suggests that the field equations should be expressed in terms of @xmath88 , as done in  .",
    "the above relations imply that @xmath140 only occurs on the pure massless scalar field subsets @xmath113 , while @xmath141 requires @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",

    "a consequence @xmath135 is a monotonically decreasing function also on this subset , except when @xmath146 .",
    "however , when @xmath146 is not an invariant subset , then @xmath146 just corresponds to an inflection point in the graph of @xmath135 , and @xmath135 is thereby still monotonically decreasing .",
    "it is only when @xmath146 is an invariant subset that @xmath135 stops decreasing and for which @xmath146 can be an asymptotic state . for this to happen requires that @xmath147 , since @xmath148 on @xmath109 , also means that @xmath147 must be an invariant subset .",
    "since @xmath149 when @xmath150 , @xmath143 , this leads to the condition that @xmath151 , which by our assumptions about monotonically decreasing potentials can only happen on the @xmath152 boundaries .",
    "hence @xmath135 is also monotonically decreasing on @xmath109 .",
    "this implies that there can be no fixed points or recurring orbits ( solution trajectories ) in @xmath103 and @xmath109 , and due to   all solution trajectories in @xmath103 and @xmath109 originate and end at @xmath152 and @xmath118 , which shows that it is essential to extend the state space to include these boundaries in order to fully describe the dynamics of the present models .",

    "it is only the cases of a constant or an exponential potential that effectively reduce the problem from three to two dimensions by decoupling the equation for the scalar field variable .",

    "moreover , originally , before one realized that the deceleration parameter @xmath88 is evolving , it was thought that scale invariance and thereby a constant @xmath88 was quite desirable , since this would solve fine - tuning problems such as coincidence and energy scale problems .",
    "on the other hand , the symmetries also make the models quite inflexible . due to the changing evolutionary history of @xmath88 , where @xmath88 is currently negative ,",
    "the scaling symmetries must be broken , while still leading to models that in some way at least alleviate various fine - tuning problems ; for these reasons , and from a phenomenological perspective , scale - invariant models are no longer the favorite candidates as dark energy models .",
    "in the influential papers  @xcite peebles and ratra argued that dark energy can be phenomenologically modeled by a minimally coupled scalar field with a potential with a shallow tail , which results in the dark field energy density decreasing more slowly than the matter energy density to its `` natural '' value  zero . in particular they considered an inverse power - law potential , @xmath339 in addition they assumed a matter dominated flat flrw universe after inflation , which resulted in a set of approximate flat flrw equations for which they found a particular solution , which was shown to be linearly stable within the approximate context .",

    "the property that @xmath360 for @xmath169 , irrespective of @xmath48 ( as long as @xmath169 exists until it merges with @xmath166 ) , can subsequently be exploited by comparing the reduced two - dimensional dynamics of a sequence of reduced exponential scalar field state spaces , as done in  @xcite , to yield an approximate heuristic description of the behavior of the tracking solution .",
    "nevertheless , it should be clear that the dynamics of an inverse power - law potential model is globally very different from that of a given exponential potential , which is what can be expected from a model that does not exhibit scaling symmetries .",
    "the observational viability difficulties of the dust and inverse power - law potential models , including those of tracker solutions , arise because @xmath361 when @xmath362 , since a large @xmath48 makes the dynamics deviate from @xmath2cdm dynamics .",
    "this motivates us to consider other types of scalar field potentials for which @xmath48 is globally and asymptotically regularized .",
    "for this reason , we therefore phenomenologically regularize @xmath48 of the inverse power - law potential and use   to derive @xmath37 , in arguably the simplest possible way , so that @xmath48 becomes finite and one obtains continuous deformations of @xmath2cdm cosmology .      to obtain a type of potential that has a regular @xmath48 and still behaves like an inverse power - law potential for large @xmath0",

    "the models increasingly yield similar results as the inverse power - law potential , which again is to be expected .",
    "the structure of the flat flrw models with dust and inverse power - law potential strongly suggests that it does not suffice to just have a monotonically decreasing potential with a shallow potential tail , since even if @xmath378 when @xmath309 a large @xmath50 for some @xmath0 generally results in considerable deviations from @xmath2cdm cosmology .",
    "there are significant differences in the solution structure if @xmath48 is globally and asymptotically bounded or not .",

    "it should be pointed out that this not only produces an observationally viable set of models , but also alleviates the coincidence and possibly other fine - tuning problems since _ all _ orbits with initial values of @xmath131 close to 1 behave similarly because the invariant subset that originates from @xmath117 then constitutes an attracting separatrix surface , eliminating the need for any measure .",

    "as a consequence of the above features it follows that asymptotic future ( past ) dynamics reside on the @xmath406 ( @xmath405 ) subset .    because it is possible to solve the conservation equations for each of the two fluids in terms of the scale factor , this gives rise to a constant of motion , which also reflects that the problem is really a three - dimensional one . to obtain this conserved quantity",
