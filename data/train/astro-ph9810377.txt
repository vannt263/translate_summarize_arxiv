    "one of the surprises in the studies of galaxy clusters is that they were detected by the  ( lieu  1996c ) , an instrument whose primarily goals were the studies of stars and gas in the local neighborhood .",
    "the  has both imaging and spectroscopic capabilities that operate in the spectral range 70 - 760   ( 177 - 16.3 ev ; haisch , bowyer , and malina 1993 ) . for high latitude sight lines of low galactic @xmath3 ( @xmath4 2 ) , the optical depth @xmath5 at 130 ev and @xmath6 at 180 ev ,",
    "so 6 - 30% of the emission will be unabsorbed , permitting the detection of bright soft x - ray sources .",
    "soft x - ray emission also can be detected with the  pspc , which has an energy response extending below 150 ev and has significantly more collecting area than the  at energies of significant transmission of x - rays . at 0.13 kev ( the peak sensitivity of the  lexan / boron detector )",
    "the effective area is 28 @xmath7 , compared with 40 @xmath7 for the  pspc . at 0.155 kev",
    ", the  effective area has dropped to less than @xmath7 , whereas for the pspc it is greater than 100 @xmath7 .    in their study of the virgo cluster , centered on m87 , lieu ( 1996b )",
    "were unable to successfully fit the data with a single - temperature spectral model at the ambient cluster temperature ( about 2 kev ) and with the x - ray absorbing column fixed at the galactic @xmath3 .",
    "the failure to fit the data was due to a large excess of soft residuals , indicating that there was an additional soft component .",
    "a two - temperature model led to an acceptable fit when the soft component had a temperature of about 0.05 kev , implying that large amounts of gas at @xmath8k are present .",
    "an exciting consequence of this observation is that the cooling rate of the gas , if in a steady - state , would be at least 340  , at least a factor of 30 greater than the value determined from the standard cooling flow picture of 10  ( fabian , nulsen , and canizares 1984 ) .",
    "the presence of such a large amount of cooling gas has a variety of consequences , such as the a mass of low temperature component that was comparable to the virial mass of the cluster ( fabian 1996 ; sarazin and lieu 1998 ) .",
    "also , there were observable consequences , such as emission from the o vi species , which was not detected in the same clusters in which the soft component was present ( dixon , hurwitz , and ferguson 1996 ) .",
    "faced with these difficulties , another suggestion was proposed for this emission : the soft x - ray component was due to inverse compton radiation of the cosmic microwave background by low energy cosmic ray electrons ( sarazin and lieu 1998 ) .",
    "since the original study of the virgo cluster , several other clusters have been studied by the same group : abell 1656 ( coma ) , abell 1795 , abell 2199 , and abell 1367 ( lieu  1996a , b , c ; mittaz , lieu , and lockman 1998 ; table  [ tab : list ] ) . in each case , the excess x - ray emission is detected at approximately the same energy , about 0.15 - 0.25 kev .",
    "one might expect a thermal feature to occur at the same energy in different clusters , but it seems surprising to us that a nonthermal component would always appear at the same energy .    here",
    "we take a different approach to examining the phenomenon of the excess soft emission . since the soft emission becomes less prominent , and",
    "may disappear if lower galactic absorption columns were possible , we ask whether it is feasible to achieve a spectral fit without the soft component and for absorption columns consistent with the galactic @xmath3 .",
    "although we do not disagree with the fitting method employed by lieu and collaborators , there has recently been a downward revision of the x - ray cross section at these energies , due to improved cross sections for .",
    "we examine whether this change to the x - ray cross section permits an acceptable spectral fit without a soft component .",
    "one of the central issues in the measurement of the soft component in galaxy clusters is the correction for the absorption of x - rays by galactic gas .",
    "a very important issue for this absorption , which has only been rectified recently , is the value for the cross section of he ( fig .",
    "reff1 ) . at energies in the 150 - 250 ev range , where most of the absorption occurs",
    ", he accounts for about 71% of the cross section , with hydrogen providing the remainder .",
    "the commonly used cross section of bauciska - church and mccammon ( 1993 ) adopted a cross section for he that is based upon data from marr and west ( 1976 ) .",
    "these are 18 - 19% larger than the recent determination of yan , sadeghpour , and dalgarno ( 1998 ) , which is similar to the determinations of samson ( 1994 ) , bizeau and wuilleumier ( 1995 ) , and morrison and mccammon ( 1983 , which is in turn based upon data from henke  1982 ) . by using the improved cross section for he , the total cross section at 150 ev decreases by 13% , thus causing a rise in the expected soft continuum in a single temperature fit ( for fixed @xmath3 ) .",
    "using the new absorption cross sections , we have addressed the issue of whether the x - ray spectra from the clusters showing soft component can be fit without employing a soft component . in this case , we let the value for the galactic absorption column be a parameter that is fit , rather than fixing it .",
    "if a successful fit is discovered , as determined from an acceptable @xmath9 , we examine whether the fit value for the galactic absorption column is consistent or inconsistent with the galactic @xmath3 value .",
    "the x - ray spectral fitting is performed on our data as discussed by arabadjis and bregman ( 1998 ) , whereby the  pspc data are corrected for gain fluctuations across the image plane ( through pcpicor ) and periods of time with high backgrounds are removed , which removes only a few percent of the data at most .",
    "two concentric adjacent annuli , with point sources removed , were used to produce a pair of spectrally well - behaved x - ray sources for each cluster ( table  [ tab : source ] ) .",
    "( in a2199 and a1795 the annuli are chosen specifically to avoid the known cooling flow regions . )",
    "the exception to this is coma ( abell 1656 ) , where we sought to avoid the galaxies near the center of the cluster . in that case we chose two circular regions with radii of @xmath10 near the center but avoiding the member galaxies .",
    "background spectra were generally taken from annuli with widths between 2 - 4@xmath11 and radii between 15 and @xmath12 , again with point sources removed .",
    "the temperatures and redshift of each cluster were taken from white , jones and forman ( 1997 ) , and the metallicity assumed for each cluster was 0.3 . it should be noted that other recent temperature determinations ( e.g. white  1994 ; donnelly  1998 ) are within a few tenths of a kev of our adopted values , the effect of which is minimal upon the derived columns .",
    "this leaves two free parameters in each fit , the intervening column and the spectral normalization .",
    "the exception to this is virgo , where we fit for the temperature along with the column and normalization , and set the abundance to 0.34 ( hwang 1997 ) .",
    "the resulting temperatures , @xmath13 and @xmath14 kev , are consistent with the temperature profiles derived for virgo by nulsen and bhringer ( 1995 ) and dacri , de grandi , and molendi ( 1998 ) .",
    "the derived columns are not particularly sensitive to changes of the order of @xmath15 k and @xmath16 , changing by less than 5% .",
    "spectral fitting is performed using xspec version 10 ( see , e.g. , arnaud 1996 ) , with the important change that we have put in the new cross sections for of yan , sadeghpour , and dalgarno ( 1998 ) into the x - ray absorption routine ( vphabs ) .",
    "unlike the work discussed by lieu  ( 1996a , b , c ) , we use the  data over the energy range 0.14 - 2.4 kev but we avoid the three softest channels , for which the calibration may be unreliable ( briel , burkert , and pfeffermann 1989 ; snowden  1995 ) .",
    "successful single component fits were obtained for each of the objects ( table  [ tab : fits ] ) for helium abundances of he / h=0.09 and 0.10 .",
    "this range brackets most recent abundance determinations ( osterbrock , tran , and veilleux 1992 ; baldwin  1991 ) , although dupuis  ( 1994 ) find a somewhat lower value based upon  observations of da stars .",
    "our model fits show a tight correlation between the he abundance and the column density : a reduction of 10% in he / h increases the derived column by @xmath17% . as we discuss later , the effect is to bring the x - ray columns closer to their corresponding galactic hi columns .",
    "spectral fits with he / h=0.10 are shown with their residuals in figure  [ f2 ] . in region 1 of a1656 and a1795 and region 2 of a2199",
    "the residuals show a small systematic modulation near 0.25 kev .",
    "this is due to a small error in the  calibration matrices which results in a slight offset in the peak of the response function .",
    "because the offset is in the negative direction , it does not change our conclusion : if it is not due to calibration errors , it implies a either soft x - ray _ deficit _ , or a somewhat greater absorption column . as discussed above , in the case of virgo the temperature was an additional fit parameter in the spectral modelling , and so we show confidence contours in @xmath18 and t in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "the study of the virgo cluster was the work that established the studies of soft excess emission in clusters and motivated further work so we begin our discussion here .",
    "our analysis leads to differences between the x - ray absorption column and the 21 cm hi column that are no greater than 1.3@xmath0 and the residuals are symmetric about zero ( table  [ tab : fits ] ; figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the difference between our result and that of lieu ( 1996b ) is due primarily to the lower cross section that we used and secondarily to a lower 21 cm column density derived by hartmann and burton ( 1997 ) .",
    "the difference between the 21 cm hi column of hartmann and burton ( 1997 ) and of lieu  ( 1996b ) is within the uncertainties of the two different techniques used and is probably caused by small calibration differences , as previously discussed in arabadjis and bregman ( 1998 ) .",
    "when we use the 21 cm columns and cross sections used by lieu  ( 1996b ) we find excess soft emission as well , which nearly disappears when the intervening column in the model is allowed to be fit .",
    "figure  [ f4]a is a monotemperature fit to the virgo data which uses the lieu  ( 1996c ) value @xmath19 2 and fits for the cluster temperature , abundance , and metallicity",
    ". there does indeed appear to be excess emission from 0.14 - 0.30 kev , and the reduced chi - squared value of the fit , @xmath20 , is an unacceptable 1.37 .",
    "the lieu study remedied this by introducing a second ( lower ) temperature component which lowered @xmath20 to a marginally acceptable 1.3 .",
    "our fit ( figure  [ f4]b ) , which uses the yan  ( 1998 ) cross section and allows @xmath18 to vary , eliminates the soft excess as well , with @xmath21 .",
    "we note that the x - ray column densities that we obtained are similar to those obtained by nulsen and bhringer ( 1995 ) , who used the absorption cross sections of morrison and mccammon ( 1983 ) , which are very similar to the yan , sadeghpour , and dalgarno ( 1998 ) cross sections that we employed ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) . in summary ,",
    "our x - ray absorption column densities , which are similar to some other studies , are not significantly different than the 21 cm hi column density , leading us to conclude that a soft x - ray excess at energies below 0.3 kev is not a required feature of the x - ray spectrum of the virgo cluster .    for the other four clusters ,",
    "the x - ray absorption column is generally within 2.5@xmath0 of the 21 cm column when he / h = 0.10 , and within 1.8@xmath0 of the 21 cm column for h / he = 0.09 ( table  [ tab : fits ] ; figure  [ f5 ] ) . in abell 2199",
    ", the x - ray column exceeds the 21 cm column , while for the three other clusters , it is lower than the 21 cm column .",
    "however , in only one location is the x - ray absorption column more than 3@xmath0 different than the 21 cm column , position 2 in the coma cluster when using the larger he / h value of 0.10 ( a 3.6@xmath0 difference ) .",
    "we find this rather weak evidence for concluding that the x - ray absorption column is lower than the 21 cm column .    as discussed previously ( arabadjis and bregman 1998 )",
    ", these findings imply that the ionized layer responsible for the pulsar dispersion measure must be very highly ionized ( at least 50% of the he in the form of ) , since it can not contribute significantly to the x - ray absorption column .",
    "however , the ionized column is consistent with that associated with a hot galactic halo , which has been confirmed as a feature of the galaxy by two independent groups ( pietz  1998 ; snowden 1998 ) .",
    "future work will be able to reduce the uncertainties for several of these measurements .",
    "the upcoming x - ray telescope  should have an excellent calibration and it will have greatly superior spectral resolution compared to , so the accuracy of the fit and the resulting determination of the x - ray absorbing column should be more accurate . also , more accurate 21 cm measurements of the hi column will be possible with the green bank telescope , which should become operational within the next year .",
    "however , a major source of uncertainty is the he / h ratio in the ism , and unless future observations can help to decide how to handle dust corrections to photionization with improved accuracy , this uncertainty will persist .",
