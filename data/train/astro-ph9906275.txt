    "it has long been known that accreting stellar - mass black holes in galactic binaries exhibit a `` bi - modal '' spectral behavior - namely the so called high - soft and low - hard spectral states ; see liang ( 1998 ) for a recent review .",
    "high and low in this context allude to the relative 2 - 10 kev luminosities in a given system , which in turn responds to the rate at which mass accretion is taking place .",
    "an important point is that the high - soft state spectra are apparently a _",
    "unique _ black hole signature , whereas the low - hard state spectral form has been seen in neutron star binaries under certain conditions  typically in low luminosity states of bursters ( barret & grindlay 1995 ) .",
    "it thus seems reasonable to speculate that this unique spectral signature is directly tied to the black hole event horizon .",
    "this is the primary motivation for the bulk motion comptonization model ( bmc ) introduced in several previous papers , and recently applied with striking success to a substantial body of observational data .",
    "we will not describe the model in detail here , but refer the interested reader to the literature and briefly state its essential components : compton scattering of thermal x - rays from bulk - motion infall in close proximity to the black - hole event horizon , and a hot compton cloud obscuring the inner disk during periods of low - mass - accretion rate [ titarchuk , mastichiadis & kylafis 1997 , titarchuk & zannias 1998 , shrader & titarchuk 1998 , laurent & titarchuk 1999 , borozdin et al .",
    "1999 ( hereafter tmk97 , tz98 , sht98 , lt99 , bor99 respectively ) ] .    given the success of the bmc model in reproducing the high - soft state continuum , we have begun to investigate potential predictive power . from the spectral shape and normalization , one can calculate an effective disk radius and the mass - to - distance ratio @xmath7 .",
    "other quantities such as a black hole mass and mass - accretion rate can be determined if the distance or mass are known independently .",
    "this is dependent upon an additional factor , @xmath8 , the so called `` hardening factor '' which represents the ratio of color - to - effective temperature .",
    "if one can identify several `` calibrators '' , i.e. sources for which distance and mass are well determined , the model can be applied to a derive @xmath8 over the available dynamic range in luminosity .",
    "three such sources are gro  j1655 - 40 , for which we have presented extensive analysis in a previous paper , lmc  x-1 for which the distance is well constrained , and nova muscae 1991 ( herein nm91 ) , for which the binary parameters are reasonably constrained . in the latter two cases , we have assumed the hardening factor , @xmath9 , derived from our analysis of gro  j1655 - 40 .",
    "the temperature - flux curves we present provide a self - consistency test of this assumption .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the bmc model to lmc  x-1 and nm91 then , drawing from previous analysis of gro  j1655 - 40 , infer some physical parameters of these binary systems based on the model and on methodology detailed in bor99 and section 3 . in section 4",
    "we offer interpretation of our results including qualitative inferences regarding the evolution of the emission - region size over the course of the nm91 decline .",
    "if the physics underlying the emergent spectrum is understood , one can , with minimal model dependency , use observables to determine parameters of the system such as the mass - to - distance ratio , the mass accretion rate , and the disk effective radius . from the inferred color temperature and absolute normalization , the effective area of the emission region can be obtained in terms of the distance and @xmath8 .",
    "the observable surface area can be related to the black hole mass using , for example , the shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 ) , herein ss73 , prescription modified to treat electron scattering and free - free absorption and emission [ titarchuk 1994 ( hereafter ti94 ) , see also shimura & takahara 1995 ] .",
    "the emergent spectrum is then represented by the integral of a diluted blackbody function characterized by @xmath10 .",

    "the color temperature distribution @xmath17 which has the radial dependence , @xmath18^{1/4}(1.36r_{in})^{3/4}}\\over{r^{3/4}(1/7)^{1/4}}},\\ ] ] is normalized to @xmath19 at @xmath20 .",
    "the normalization factor of the equation ( 2 ) measured in units phot  sec@xmath12  ster@xmath12   @xmath21 is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the inclination angle ( between the line of sight and the disk normal ) , and d is in kpc .",
    "we then apply the mean value theorem to replace the radial temperature distribution with @xmath24 giving @xmath25 - 1}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 . in general",
    ", @xmath27 is a function of the photon energy @xmath28 , however if the energy coverage is such that the ratio @xmath29 , @xmath27 is nearly constant and the single temperature blackbody is a reasonable approximation to the disk spectrum .",
    "the value of @xmath27 then depends only on @xmath24 ( or @xmath19 ) .",
    "bor99 derived @xmath8 using inferred parameters and an averaging method over a large flux range [ @xmath30 ergs s@xmath12@xmath31 obtaining that @xmath9 .",
    "we can then calculate the mass - to - distance ratio @xmath32 and if the distance or mass are known , the mass accretion rate @xmath33 ^ 3}\\over{(1/7)3 ^ 4t_h^4}}.\\ ] ]",
    "to test the viability of our method , we have collected data for lmc  x-1 , for which the distance is well constrained by virtue of its location in the lmc - herein we adopt the lmc distance of @xmath34  kpc of panagia et al ( 1991 ) as the distance to lmc  x-1 - and nm91 for which the binary parameters are reasonably well constrained and the distance is known to a factor of @xmath35 . from earlier work on gro",
    "j1655 - 40 ( bor99 ) , we determined that @xmath9 , and demonstrated that the data are strikingly consistent with the temperature - flux relationship predicted by the ss73/ti94 model .",
    "we use this information here .",
    "lmc  x-1 , has been observed extensively with various instruments , for example , heao-1 ( white & marshall , 1984 ) , bbxrt ( schlegel et al . 1994 ) , and rxte ( schmidtke et al . 1999 ) .",
    "although luminous , given its @xmath36kpc distance , its intensity is much lower than that of typical galactic xrbs .",
    "the impact on our study is a lack of reliable measurement above @xmath37  kev .",
    "we found that typical 2 - 10  ksec exposures available from the rxte data archives did not include reasonable hexte ( 20 - 200  kev ) measurements .",
    "we also examined the publicly available cgro / osse data .",
    "the source appears to be marginally detected in a 200  ksec exposure , a simple power law fit yielding a spectral index consistent with typical pca values .",
    "however , it is poorly constrained ( @xmath38 ) , and since the data were not contemporaneously obtained , we can not reliably apply our model . usually , however , the proportional counter data alone were sufficient to constrain our model parameters .",
    "nm91 was a bright x - ray transient ( also known as gs  1124 - 683 = grs  1121 - 68 ) discovered in january 1991 independently by ginga / asm and granat / watch .",
    "it reached a peak intensity of about 6 times the crab over a 2 - 10  kev band , and its light curve exhibited the canonical x - ray nova fast - rise exponential - decay profile ( e.g. chen , shrader & livio 1997 ) .",
    "subsequent to its discovery , a number of follow - up observations with the ginga lac detectors were made , covering portions of the outburst peak and subsequent decay .",
    "both the high - soft and low - hard states were seen ( ebisawa et al . 1994 ) .",
    "we then followed procedures detailed in bor99 to analyze 7 spectra for nm91 and about 30 spectra for lmc - x1 .",
    "some representative results , for lmc  x-1 ( averaged over the sample ) are t=@xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( also see figures 1 and 2 . ) .",
    "cases of particular interest for nm91 , are the march 1991 data ( @xmath42 ) when the hard - power- law component is not detected , and september when the source has entered the low - hard state ( t,@xmath43)=(@xmath44 ) .",
    "a typical peak - outburst high - state spectrum ( e.g. 20 january 1991 ) has ( t,@xmath45)=(@xmath46 ) .",
    "while we were unable to obtain a satisfactory fit to the march 1991 data , we found that we could model the september 1991 data not only in terms of a thermal comptonization spectrum ( or simple hard power law ) , but as a bmc spectrum with a relatively large @xmath47value  i.e. the scattered component had become dominant .",
    "the disk at this stage is nearly obscured and our spectral index parameter decreases to values below the asymptotic limit of the typical high - state case ( tz98 ) .",
    "the apparent broad absorption feature , first noted by ebisawa et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and modeled in detail by zycki , done & smith ( 1998 ) is evident in our deconvolved spectrum of 12 january , 1991 .",
    "however , the depth that we obtain is only about half that of ebisawa et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and it is substantially less pronounced in the 20 january 1991 spectrum .",
    "we do not find strong evidence for such a feature in subsequent spectra , however , statistics become limiting as the source faded . in order to treat the entire evolutionary sequence in a consistent manner ,",
    "we have opted not to incorporate additional features into our analysis .    following the prescription outlined in the previous section , we have constructed a plot of the empirical flux - temperature relationship for lmc  x-1 and nm91 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the solid curves represent the corresponding relationship in the context of our disk model for the indicated value of @xmath48 , while the dashed - line curves represent the @xmath49 deviation corridor about the model for @xmath50 .",
    "this utilizes the hardening factor obtained by bor99 .",
    "the theoretical curves can be reproduced analytically using the following formulae :    @xmath51    we find that @xmath27 can be represented by a fourth - order polynomial of the form @xmath52 with the coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 for @xmath58 respectively .",
    "we then applied a normalization factor of @xmath59 to the theoretical values to match the data .",
    "the data in figure 3 were obtained by integrating our model flux from @xmath60  kev .",
    "a scale factor of 200 was applied to lmc  x-1 to present both sources in the same plot ( 200 is approximately the square of the ratio of the mass - to - distance values we derive for nm91and lmc x-1 ) .",
    "most of the points are associated with the inner disk edge near @xmath61 .",
    "however , as the flux decreases , and nm91 enters the low - hard state , _ the inner edge recedes outwards to 17 schwarzchild radii_. esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter emcn ) argue that the disk is located near the last stable orbit at @xmath50 in the high state , consistent with what we infer .",
    "however , our conclusions are incompatible with the emcn scenario of an accretion flow extending out to @xmath62 during decline , requiring instead a transition from the high to low states and optically thin to optically thick structure at @xmath6 .",
    "zycki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have independently reached the same conclusion , that the retreat of the inner disk during the high to the low state transition is much slower than predicted by emcn and optically thick material within @xmath63 is generally present .",
    "the path we have followed in reaching these conclusions however , is distinct from zycki et al ( 1997 ) , primarily in that those authors applied an additional model component  an absorption - edge feature  from which information regarding the disk was extracted .",
    "we have applied a self - consistently calculated model without additive components . using extensive hydrodynamical and radiative transfer calculations ,",
    "chakrabarti & titarchuk ( 1995 ) first predicted , that the apparent position of the inner edge of the accretion disk would be seen as moving to the position of the shock location ( i.e. between 8 and 15 @xmath64 ) .",
    "our conclusions here would seem to support that prediction .",
    "we have calculated mass - to - distance ratios following the method outlined in the previous section . for nm91 , orosz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have presented a comprehensive dynamical study of the quiescent binary system , leading to a maximum probability contour in @xmath65 space with m ranging from about 5 to 7.5 @xmath66 for inclination @xmath67 .",
    "the most uncertain parameter however is its distance , with published estimates ranging from 1.4  kpc ( della valle et al 1991 ) to 8  kpc ( cheng et al .",
    "orosz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who argue that @xmath68  kpc based on their characterization of the secondary star , and brightness estimates for the quiescent disk , however , their uncertainty may be understated .",
    "we calculate the bh mass , @xmath69\\times[1/2/\\cos(i)]^{1/2}d_{5.5}(t_h/2.6)^2 $ ] and mass accretion rate in the disk in eddington units , @xmath70 [ using formula ( 5 ) , mass value 24 and @xmath71 kev ] where @xmath72  kpc .",
    "our mass estimate can be reconciled with orosz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) only if @xmath73 , which would make the outburst luminosity @xmath74ergs  s@xmath12 .",
    "we note , that for our flux measurement , if @xmath75 and the mass is near the lower end of the range cited by orosz et al ( 1996 ) , the luminosity is very nearly at the eddington limit , whereas in our case it is substantially sub - eddington .",
    "however , since stable disk accretion is occurring , super - eddington levels can not persist and a mass as low as @xmath76 seems unlikely .    for lmc  x-1",
    ", we can calculate the mass directly .",
    "we find @xmath77\\times[(0.5/\\cos(i)]^{1/2}(t_h/2.6)^2 $ ] and @xmath78 .",
    "this large of a mass is consistent with the fact that lmc  x-1 is relatively luminous compared to typical galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "it would seem , however , to be at odds with published values obtained from radial velocity measurements of the candidate optical companion `` star 32 '' , of @xmath79 ( hutchings et al 1987 ) .",
    "to reconcile our result with the upper allowed - range of their analysis would require a low - inclination system , @xmath80 , however , this could render the ellipsoidal - variability amplitude below the detectability threshold .",
    "it must be noted however , that the association of lmc  x-1 with star 32 remains speculative , and the only significant constraint on the inclination is an apparent lack of eclipsing .",
    "we can make an additional argument against the lower end of the hutchings et al ( 1987 ) mass range : for a given disk inner radius and temperature distribution , @xmath81 scales in proportion with @xmath82 . since @xmath7 , and in this case @xmath82 is an invariant of our model , for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , which is inconsistent with a high - soft state source ( lt99 , bor99 ) .",
    "the temperature flux relation in nm91 seems to populate two distinct tracks .",
    "this is an indication that the emission area , and thus the inner - disk radius , is increasing .",
    "this is consistent with the previous conclusions of zycki et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who find @xmath85  as illustrated in figure 3 an inner disk radius of @xmath6 is consistent with our analysis .",
    "an issue central to stellar evolution theory is the distribution of black hole masses in the galaxy and contact binaries may provide our only insight .",
    "dynamical analyses based on optical studies are often limited due to dust obscuration or the brightness dominance of the disk .",
    "our method offers , in principle , an independent means of parameter determination .",
    "this work made use of the high - energy astrophysics science archive research center , the compton gamma ray observatory and rossi x - ray timing explorer science support facilities at the nasa goddard space flight center .",
