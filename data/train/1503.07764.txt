    "the spins of electrons confined in quantum dots are considered candidates for the quantum information processing @xcite , and the external control of confined spins has attracted a lot of attention @xcite . in iii - v devices",
    "the possible applicability is limited by low coherence time due to the interaction of the electrons with the nuclear spin field @xcite .",
    "the absence of the nuclear spin - field in carbon - based materials : graphene @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite makes them attractive for coherent spin manipulation .",
    "in contrast to graphene@xcite in which an electrostatic confinement of charge carriers is excluded by the klein tunneling @xcite , formation of quantum dots by external potentials is straightforward in semiconducting carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) @xcite .",
    "the electron spin can be controlled with electric fields by the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling in graphene is of an atomic origin and couples the @xmath2 orbitals ( forming the @xmath0 bonds ) and the in - plane @xmath3 which form the @xmath1 between the ions .",
    "however , due to the orthogonality of @xmath2 and in - plane orbitals the spin - orbit interaction does not mix the electron spins in the band structure @xcite .",
    "this is no longer the case once the graphene plane is folded into the cnt@xcite , for which the effect of spin - orbit coupling are clearly observed in spite of low atomic number of carbon @xcite .    the spin control in cnts is intensely studied by both experiment @xcite and theory @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental observations of spin transitions driven by external ac electric field were reported @xcite with the electric - dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) mechanism that was applied previously for iii - v quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the effects of the edsr - driven transitions @xcite are observed by lifting the blockade of the current flow through a biased double quantum dot .",
    "the spin - transitions in carbon nanotubes can be triggered by a bend of the cnt @xcite , which induces a dependence of the zeeman splitting on electron position within the nanotube via the strong anisotropy of the effective land factor @xmath4 . a subsequent experiment @xcite indicated that the bend of the cnt has indeed a dominant contribution to the edsr effect .",
    "recent papers @xcite investigated the cnt bend in the context of the symmetry of single - electron wave functions in external electric fields @xcite , atomic disorder @xcite , and the leakage current @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the contribution of the bend of the cnt to the principal spin - orbit interaction resulting from folding the graphene plane into the tube @xcite .",
    "we develop an effective tight - binding hamiltonian for the so coupling resulting from the bend of the cnt as a whole .",
    "we consider the effects resulting from the bend of the cnt for electron spin manipulation in a double quantum dot .",
    "the contribution of bend - related so interaction for the results should be expected small since the radii of the bend are by at least an order of magnitude larger than the cnt radii .",
    "we indeed find that the effects of the spin - orbit coupling resulting from the bend for the energy spectra are negligible , but the spin transition driven by edsr are accelerated several times .",
    "we find that generally the spin - flip transitions occur with a larger rate when the interdot charge transfer accompanies the inversion of the spin as compared to intradot spin flips with fixed charge distribution .",
    "the resonant frequencies for transitions involving charge transfer with conserved or flipped spin are close also at high magnetic field .",
    "we find that the direct rabi oscillation with spin inversion becomes attenuated by the spin - conserving interdot charge transition for a larger amplitude of the ac field .",
    "however , the spin - flip transitions can still be reached by the fractional resonances .",
    "the experimental conditions with ac bias applied to the cnt resemble the ones present for atoms and molecules in strong laser fields . in these systems besides the common rabi oscillation , fractional resonances  also known as higher harmonics generation  are observed @xcite , which are counterparts of multiphoton transitions of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "we indicate that in conditions when the transition with spin flip and interdot charge transfer is masked by a strong spin - conserving transition , one can employ fractional resonances to perform the spin - flips .",
    "we indicate that the rates of spin - flipping transitions are non - monotonic functions of the driving frequency due to overlap with the strong spin - conserving resonances .",
    "the so coupling due to the bend largely increases the width of the fractional resonances for spin - flipping transitions .",
    "we consider a cnt of length @xmath5 nm  see fig . [ 1sc](a ) .",
    "the cnts geometry is defined by a chiral vector @xcite @xmath6 with primitive lattice vectors , @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 nm . here we consider a zigzag nanotube with @xmath10 , @xmath11 for which the cnt radius is @xmath12 nm @xcite , and for which an energy gap is present in the dispersion relation that allows for confinement of charge carriers by external potentials .",
    "we assume that the radius of the bend is @xmath13 nm [ see fig .",
    "[ 1sc](a ) ] , unless stated otherwise .",
    "the atomic spin - orbit interaction is due to the electric field of the nuclei .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction due to this field mixes the @xmath2 orbitals with @xmath14 , and @xmath15 orbitals of opposite spins .",
    "the mixing leads to hybridization of @xmath2 orbitals [ labeled as @xmath16 for @xmath17-th ion  see fig .",
    "1(a)]- forming the @xmath0 bonds with the @xmath18 ( labeled as @xmath19 )  forming the @xmath1 bonds between the nearest neighbor atoms @xcite . for @xmath20",
    "standing for the spin - orbitals along the @xmath16 orbital of @xmath17th ion the first - order corrections to the spin - orbital @xmath21 due to the atomic spin - orbit interaction stemming from the electric field of the nuclei have the form@xcite : @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 parameter describes the strength of the so coupling .",
    "for the flat graphene the @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbitals for the nearest neighbor atoms are orthogonal , but the orthogonality is lifted when the graphene plane is folded into the cnt @xcite , which introduces spin - orbit coupling effects to the @xmath0 band @xcite .",
    "the second - order tight - binding hamiltonian theories taking into account the @xmath27 and @xmath28 orbitals are available @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the entire basis introduces combined effects including the electron - hole asymmetry in the spectrum @xcite and spin - splitting of the bands for chiral cnt s @xcite . in this paper",
    "we restrict the study to zigzag ( achiral ) cnt and consider the conduction band states only .",
    "we aim at estimation of the spin - orbit coupling effects due to the bend of the entire cnt . since the effects of the bend should be expected much smaller than the ones due to folding of the graphene to the cnt we restrict the modeling to the lowest - order corrections only @xcite .",
    "namely , we consider only the @xmath2 electrons , and the effects of mixing of type given by eqs .",

    "we look for an effective @xcite tight - binding hamiltonian of form",

    "the second summation in eq . ( [ eqh ] ) accounts for the external potential and the zeeman interaction with the land factor @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 stands for the vector of pauli matrices , and * b * for the magnetic field vector .",

[ 1sc](a ) ] and not on a coordinate along the length of the bent cnt .",
    "thus , the bend lowers the angular symmetry of the eigenstates with respect to the axis of the tube , which as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite allows for the spin - flip transitions in presence of the so coupling .",
    "the external potential defined within the cnt in the absence of the ac field is then @xmath39 , where the second term is responsible for the bias field applied to the system .    the previous work @xcite used the hopping parameters for a straight cnt , while the present paper deals with effects of the bend to the parameters including the so interaction .",
    "to include the effect of the bend into so coupling we need to modify the hopping parameters .",
    "for necessary transformations we use four different coordinate systems ( see fig .",

    "<S> spin - flipping transition rates are non - monotonic functions of the driving amplitude since they are masked by stronger spin - conserving charge transitions . we demonstrate that the fractional resonances  counterparts of multiphoton transitions for atoms in strong laser fields  occurring in electrically controlled nanodevices already at moderate ac amplitudes  can be used to maintain the spin - flip transitions . </S>"
