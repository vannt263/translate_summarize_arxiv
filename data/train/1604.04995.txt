    "the no - cloning theorem states that there does not exist an ideal quantum copying machine which can take two distinct non - orthogonal quantum states ( @xmath0 ) into states ( @xmath1 ) , respectively .",
    "consider two orthogonal states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we can construct a perfect cloning procedure as a unitary transformation , possibly involving a machine ( an ancilla ) @xcite such that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the blank state , @xmath6 is the initial state of the ancilla , and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) denote the output ancilla states .",
    "this implies that @xmath9 which is not equal to @xmath10 .",
    "this non - equality arises from the linearity of quantum mechanics . in spite of the no - cloning theorem",
    ", we can construct a quantum cloning machine ( qcm ) that copy an unknown quantum state approximately .",
    "buzek et.al .",
    "@xcite introduced a universal quantum cloning machine ( uqcm ) which its copying quality remains same for all input states .",
    "the fidelity of this machine is equal @xmath11 , regardless of its input state .",
    "the fidelity @xmath12 of a qcm is defined as `` how its output state @xmath13 is similar to input state @xmath14 of machine ? '' .",
    "it was also shown that the b - h uqcm machine is optimal @xcite .",
    "buzek and hillery extended their optimal uqcm to clones quantum states in arbitrary dimensional hilbert space @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there are quantum cloning machines which their fidelity depends on the parameters of the input state , i.e. , the so - called `` state - dependent qcm . ''",
    "the wootters - zurek ( w - z ) quantum cloning machine is the first example that its copying quality depends on the input state @xcite .",
    "various state - dependent qcms were also proposed @xcite .    the above mentioned qcms act only on a single party systems .",
    "but broadcasting of quantum correlation is important and essential for quantum information and computation processing @xcite .",
    "broadcasting the quantum correlation needs the construction of qcms for multi - partite systems .",
    "a simple way is to employ b - h machine for coping state of each party , locally .",
    "calculations show that this machine becomes a state - dependent qcm and also it does not preserve quantum correlations existing in the bipartite system , in an optimal manner .",
    "quantum information processing uses quantum correlation as a resource to communicate between to distant parties , hence local broadcasting is more important and useful .",
    "thus non - local b - h machine is not proper for operational quantum information processing .    in this paper",
    "we propose a local uqcm for two qubit pure states .",
    "we also introduce two classes of state - dependent qcms , by identifying our machine with pauli channel operations . in this manner",
    ", we construct our cloners by comparing the fidelity between input and output states of a symmetric unitary transformation with the fidelity between input and output states of the pauli channel operations .",
    "a comparison of the ability of qcms in broadcasting different type of quantum correlations is also investigated .",
    "quantum entanglement @xcite and quantum discord @xcite are two aspects of quantum correlations defined , respectively , within the entanglement - separability paradigm and from an information - theoretic perspective .",
    "more precisely , for the two - qubit pure and werner states we study the robustness of these quantum correlations under broadcasting .",
    "we use entanglement of formation @xcite and original quantum discord @xcite for measuring the amount of quantum correlations existing in output states of cloners .",
    "our results reveals that quantum correlation is in general very fragile during broadcasting procedure , and quantum discord is broadcasted more robustly than quantum entanglement .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follow . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce local and non - local b - h quantum copying machines and then we construct our local universal quantum copying machine for two - qubit pure states in subsection a. we then present two classes of local state - dependent quantum cloning machines for copying two - qubit states . in section iii ,",
    "we study broadcasting of quantum correlations via these qcms .",
    "the paper is concluded in section iv with a brief discussion .",
    "generalized uqcm introduced by buzek and hillery which broadcasts quantum states in @xmath15-dimensional hilbert space can be modeled by the following unitary transformation @xcite @xmath16 where@xmath17 refers to blank state , @xmath18 denotes the initial state of the ancilla ( machine ) , @xmath19 refer to output ancilla states and the cofficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real . for the case of qubits ,",
    "the dimension of hilbert space is @xmath22 .",
    "so , the basis vectors of this hilbert space are @xmath23 and @xmath24 . also ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 are @xmath27 and @xmath28 . therefore , the buzek - hillery uqcm for a given input qubit state is @xcite @xmath29 the fidelity b - h transformation defined in eq .",
    "for copying of a qubit state @xmath30 is equal to @xmath11 for all @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "now , let us assume that two distant parties @xmath33 and @xmath34 share two - qubit pure state @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "suppose , the first qubit belongs to @xmath33 and the second qubit belongs to @xmath34 .",
    "we consider the case that each of these two parties @xmath33 and @xmath34 perform b - h transformation defined in eq .",
    ", locally .",
    "by tracing over the machine vectors and after tracing over one of the two parties we get @xmath38.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fidelity between the input and output states is @xmath39 which , clearly , reveals that the local b - h machine when acting on a two - qubit state becomes state - dependent and hence loses its universality .",
    "the average fidelity of this machine is given by @xmath40 to overcome this problem , hillery and buzek propose their non - local uqcm .",
    "they considered a two - qubit state as a four - dimensional hilbert space , i.e. , substituting @xmath41 in eq . .",
    "the basis vectors of this hilbert space are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in this case , the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 take the values @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the unitary transformation of such machine is not local with respect to the a and b parties .",
    "this fact reduces the operationality of this uqcm . by tracing over the machine vectors and after tracing over one of the two parties ,",
    "we can write @xmath48.\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the @xmath50-dimensional unit matrix of each subsystem . in this case the fidelity between input state @xmath51 and output state is given by @xmath52 as we see , the fidelity of non - local case does not depend on the parameters of input state and hence the map is universal . in the following , we propose a universal local broadcasting machine for two - qubit pure states and then we explore about state - dependent qcms for two - qubit systems .",
    "a uqcm can be achieved by the following general unitary operation @xmath53 where @xmath18 denotes the initial state of the ancilla and @xmath54 refer to the output ancilla states . due to unitarity ,",
    "the only condition that we have on these states is that they are orthonormal , so that the coefficients @xmath55 satisfy the normalization condition : @xmath56 and the orthogonalization condition : @xmath57 + the symmetry of transformation implies that @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and the trace is taken over all subsystems except @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "hence , by applying this transformation on a general pure state @xmath51 and after tracing over ancillary states and states of subsystem @xmath62 or @xmath63 , we obtain @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . therefore ,",
    "we can write @xmath68 without loss of generality we can absorb phases @xmath69 to states @xmath70 , so we obtain @xmath71 also , because of symmetry of unitary transformation under exchanges between @xmath72 we must have @xmath73 now consider a universal @xmath74 quantum state cloner that takes a completely unknown pure two - qubit state @xmath51 , as input state , and generates two copy of it as the output .",
    "the optimality and universality implies that the fidelity @xmath12 between @xmath75 and @xmath76 has maximum value and also is independent of the initial parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the procedure of maximization of @xmath12 subject to the constrains defined in eqs . and",
    "is done by using lagrange multiplier method and is given in appendix a. accordingly , the optimal symmetric and universal quantum cloning machine for local cloning of two - qubit pure states could be achieve for @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 hence @xmath80 performing the above state independent qcm on general pure state @xmath51 gives us @xmath81.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , the fidelity of this universal quantum copying machine is @xmath82 , regardless of values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .      can we construct a cloning machine for an special class of bipatite quantum states , with higher degree of fidelity ?",
    "the answer is positive and leads to construction of the state - dependent qcms for bipartite system . in this subsection",
    "we look for state - dependent cloning machine for two - qubit quantum states . in this way",
    "we can construct our qcm by comparing the fidelity between input and output states of the map with the fidelity between input and output states of the pauli channel operations . the operation on an arbitrary two - qubit input state @xmath83 performed by the pauli channel is given by @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath49 is the @xmath50-dimensional unit matrix of each subsystem , @xmath85 are the pauli matrices and @xmath86 . in the following we consider two special cases    _ one - pauli channel. _",
    "first we use the `` one - pauli '' channel , i.e. , @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 for this channel , if we use a two - qubit pure input state @xmath89 with @xmath51 , we get @xmath90 in this case fidelity is @xmath91 which , clearly , depends on the input state parameters and takes its maximum value 1 for product input states , _",

    "we apply the symmetric quantum cloning machine , defined by the map presented in eq .",

    "due to symmetric property of machine , after tracing over ancillary states and states of subsystems @xmath63 or @xmath62 , we find @xmath94 .",
    "after that we calculate the fidelity between input state and output state of this machine _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath95 .",
    "+ for the case @xmath96 , a comparison between two fidelities @xmath12 and @xmath97 gives @xmath98 .",
    "also the unitarity condition implies that @xmath99 .",
    "so we have @xmath100 . due to reality and positivity of @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    ", we conclude that @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "finally , the fidelity is @xmath105 , and the average fidelity is @xmath106    _ two - pauli channel. _ as the second case , if we set @xmath107 for @xmath108 , we get the two - pauli channel , that is @xmath109 the output of this channel for the two - qubit pure state @xmath51 , as the input state @xmath83 , is @xmath110 for this case the fidelity between input state and output state of the channel is @xmath111 .",
    "as we see the fidelity depends on the input state parameters .",
    "+ now , we consider the fidelity between input state and output state of the map presented in eq . _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath95 .",
    "our aim is to construct this qcm by comparing these two fidelities .",
    "for the case of @xmath112 , comparison gives us @xmath113 and for another values of @xmath114 leads us to @xmath115 .",
    "the procedure of maximizing the fidelity with respect to the parameter @xmath116 is given in appendix b. the results of appendix b introduce a class of state - dependent quantum cloning machine ( we call it two - pauli - like cloning machine ) for local cloning of two - qubit states as @xmath117 by performing the two - pauli - like cloning machine on a general pure state @xmath51 we have @xmath118 therefore , for this cloning machine , the fidelity is @xmath119 , and the average fidelity is @xmath120",
    "in this section we study the feasibility of broadcasting of quantum correlations using the above mentioned quantum copying machines .",
    "we employ entanglement of formation and quantum discord for measuring the two aspects of the quantum correlations of a two - qubit system , i.e. , the quantum correlation defined within the entanglement - separability paradigm and the one defined from an information - theoretic perspective .",
    "the general form of two - qubit density matrix @xmath121 in bloch representation is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 are components of the local bloch vectors , @xmath125 are components of the correlation matrix @xmath126 . by performing the following general quantum cloning machine @xmath127 on the general two - qubit state introduced in eq . , we see that the bloch vectors of output state are @xmath128 , @xmath129 and the components of the correlation matrix are @xmath130 . therefore , for our universal qcm defined by eq .",
    "we have @xmath131 and hence @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 . furthermore performing the non - local b - h qcm on the general two - qubit state as input state , we obtain @xmath135 . for local b - h qcm , we have @xmath136 , so the bloch vectors and the correlation matrix of output state are @xmath137 . also for two - pauli - like cloning machine , we have @xmath138 , so the bloch vectors of output state are @xmath139 , @xmath140 and the components of the correlation matrix are @xmath141 . the unitary transformation defined in eq .",
    "maps @xmath142-states to @xmath142-states and hence all above mentioned qcms preserve the @xmath142-shape of input state .",
    "so , for pure and werner two - qubit input states , the output states of all above mentioned qcms belong to the class of @xmath142-states , i.e. , their density matrices take the following form in the standard basis @xmath143 here , for output states of all above qcms we have @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",

    "the results reveal that the quantum entanglement is more fragile than quantum discord during broadcasting procedure and it does not broadcast for some intervals of @xmath114 .    _ two - qubit werner states. _ now , we consider the two - qubit werner state , as input state .",
    "the werner state is defined by @xmath164,\\ ] ] with @xmath165 .",
    "the bloch vectors of werner states are @xmath166 , @xmath167 and the components of correlation matrix are @xmath168 .",

    "obviously , the first two qcms transform werner states to werner sates but the third and fourth one transform werner state to a bell - diagonal state . in this particular case quantum discord of the output states of first two qcms can be written as @xcite @xmath174 where @xmath175 .",

    "blue solid lines show quantum discord and the red dashed lines show eof.,width=566 ]    this figure reveals that when the input state is werner state , similar to pure input state , the non - local b - h qcm is more powerful for broadcasting the quantum discord and entanglement .",
    "although quantum discord broadcasts properly for all values of @xmath181 , quantum entanglement broadcasting is possible only for an small interval of @xmath181 .",
    "in this paper a class of universal quantum cloning machine has been presented for copying two - qubit pure states .",

    "the authors wish to thank the office of graduate studies of the university of isfahan for their support .",
    "in this appendix we provide procedure of maximization of the fidelity for state - independent cloning machine .",
