    "in  @xcite , connes and moscovici , motivated by transverse index theory for foliations , defined a cohomology theory of cyclic type for hopf algebras by introducing the concept of a modular pair in involution .",
    "this theory was later extended , by the first author and collaborators  @xcite , by introducing the notion of a stable anti - yetter - drinfeld module as coefficients for a cyclic cohomology theory of algebras or coalgebras endowed with an action or coaction of a hopf algebra .",
    "modular pairs in involution appeared naturally as one dimensional stable anti - yetter - drinfeld modules in this latter theory .",
    "it is by now clear that hopf cyclic cohomology is the right noncommutative analogue of group homology and lie algebra homology .",
    "in particular it allows an extension of connes theory of noncommutative characteristic classes  @xcite to a setup involving an action of a hopf algebra or quantum group  @xcite .",
    "there are many examples of hopf algebra - like objects that are close to being a hopf algebra but are not a hopf algebra in the usual sense .",
    "examples include ( differential graded ) super hopf algebras , quasi - hopf algebras , multiplier hopf algebras , hopf algebroids , and locally compact quantum groups . in some cases , but certainly not always , these objects are hopf algebras in an appropriate monoidal category .",
    "differential graded super hopf algebras and quasi - hopf algebras are examples of this .",
    "study of hopf algebras in symmetric monoidal categories goes back to  @xcite .",
    "recent work on braided hopf algebras is mostly motivated by low dimensional topology  @xcite .    in this paper we work in an arbitrary braided monoidal abelian category and",
    "extend the notion of a stable anti - yetter - drinfeld module over a hopf algebra in such a category .",
    "we show that to any braided hopf algebra endowed with a braided modular pair in involution one can associate a para - cocyclic object .",
    "this para - cocyclic object is cyclic if the ambient category is symmetric .",
    "in fact theorem   ( cf .",
    "also remark  ) , shows that this para - cocyclic object is almost never cocyclic if the category is not symmetric .",
    "of course , as with any para - cocyclic object , by restricting to an appropriate subspace we obtain a cocyclic object .",
    "in the symmetric case one can go much further . in this case and for an arbitrary braided stable anti - yetter - drinfeld module",
    "we obtain a cocyclic object .",
    "in fact in this case it is no longer needed to restrict to hopf algebras and one can work with module coalgebras . as a special case , we define a hopf cyclic cohomology for a ( differential graded ) super hopf algebra and relate it to the cohomology of super lie algebras by considering the enveloping algebra of a super lie algebra .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secbmc ]",
    "we recall basic notions of braided monoidal categories and _ braided hopf algebras _ which are , by definition , hopf algebra objects in such categories . in section [ hopf cyclc for h c m ]",
    "we define the notion of a stable anti - yetter - drinfeld ( sayd ) module for a braided hopf algebra . for symmetric braidings ,",
    "we define a hopf cyclic cohomology theory for triples @xmath0 consisting of a coalgebra object endowed with an action of a braided hopf algebra @xmath1 , and a braided sayd module @xmath2 . in section [ brdd cm hpf thry ]",
    "we show that when @xmath3 the hopf cyclic complex of the triple @xmath4 simplifies and we compute the resulting cocyclic object . in sections [ super hpf alg ] and",
    "[ super lie alg ] we focus on the special case of ( differential graded ) super hopf algebras and show that , for the universal enveloping algebra of a ( differential graded ) super lie algebra , hopf cyclic cohomology reduces to lie algebra homology .",
    "the last section is in a sense the heart of this paper .",
    "here we work in an arbitrary braided monoidal category and show that , for one dimensional sayd s , one can always define a para - cocyclic object for a braided hopf algebra .",
    "we compute powers of the cyclic operator and express it in terms of the braiding of the category ( theorem   and remark  ) .",
    "extending these results to more general braided sayd s and to braided triples @xmath0 is not straightforward and requires introducing extra structures .",
    "this more general case will be dealt with elsewhere .",
    "we should mention that the cyclic cohomology of ( _ ribbon_)-algebras in braided monoidal abelian categories has been introduced and studied in  @xcite , motivated by non - associative geometry .",
