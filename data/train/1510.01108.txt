    "extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) jets look like x - ray jets , but are smaller and shorter lived structures @xcite .",
    "chromospheric anemone jets were discovered by solar optical telescope ( sot ) onboard the hinode spacecraft @xcite .",
    "they are typically @xmath11@xmath1  mm long with the mean speed of @xmath12@xmath2  kms@xmath4 and they are probably connected to small scale magnetic reconnection in the solar chromosphere .",
    "recent high resolution observations from rosa ( rapid oscillations in the solar atmosphere ) multi wavelength imager on the dunn solar telescope showed numerous small - scale h@xmath5 jets , which are associated with small scale explosive events in the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "many of the observed jets in the solar atmosphere show rotational motions .",

    "recent numerical simulations also show the rotational signature in modeled jets in various situations @xcite .",
    "tornado - like structures have been reported in the solar atmosphere since 19th century @xcite . they have been associated with filaments / prominences , which are called tornado prominences @xcite .",
    "large vortex flows at the photosphere @xcite or the expansion of a twisted flux rope into the coronal cavity @xcite were assumed to be responsible for the formation of solar giant tornadoes , that may play a distinct role in the supply of mass and twists to filaments . on the other hand , the appearances of smaller scale tornadoes ( magnetic tornadoes ) in the chromosphere",
    "were recently observed @xcite , which may provide a mechanism for channeling energy from the lower into the upper solar atmosphere .",
    "the small scale tornadoes are probably formed by small scale photospheric vortex flows , which are reported in observations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite .",

    "kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) vortices have been intensively observed in recent years in solar prominences @xcite and at boundaries of rising coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) @xcite as well as in streamers @xcite .",
    "the observations resulted in increased interest toward khi in magnetic flux tubes .",
    "the khi has been studied in twisted magnetic flux tubes moving in nonmagnetic environment @xcite , magnetic tubes with partially ionized plasmas @xcite , in spicules @xcite , in soft x - ray jets @xcite , in photospheric tubes @xcite , in high - temperature and cool surges @xcite , and at the boundary of rising cmes @xcite .",
    "azimuthal velocity component in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) kink waves may also lead to khi in coronal loops @xcite .",
    "kh vortices can be considered as one of the important sources for mhd turbulence in the solar wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the khi can be developed by velocity discontinuity at boundaries of magnetic flux tubes owing to the relative motion of the tubes with regards to the solar wind or neighboring tubes .",
    "however , the flow - aligned magnetic field may suppress khi for typical velocity jumps at boundaries of observed magnetic structures , which is generally sub - alfvnic .",
    "the khi can still survive in the twisted tubes in nonmagnetic or twisted environment as the harmonics with sufficiently large azimuthal wave mode number @xmath13 are unstable for any sub - alfvnic flows along the tubes @xcite .",
    "the transverse motion of non - twisted magnetic tubes may also result in the khi for any value of speed , which may lead to the plasma turbulence and heating .",
    "recently observed fast disappearance of rapid redshifted and blueshifted excursions ( rres , rbes ) in the h@xmath5 line has been interpreted by the heating of the structures due to the khi at their boundary during transverse motion @xcite .    in general , any velocity component across the magnetic fields inside and outside a flux tube",
    "may lead to the fast development of khi .",
    "therefore , the rotation of non - twisted magnetic tubes is generally unstable to khi @xcite .",
    "the twist of tube magnetic field may , however , stabilize the instability .",
    "@xcite made the first attempt to consider the stabilizing effect of twist on khi assuming a slab model .",
    "they concluded that a very weak twist of magnetic field lines could be enough to prevent the triggering of the khi in a cylindrical coronal loop . on the other hand ,",
    "the consideration of cylindrical symmetry could be important as boundary conditions at a tube surface ( namely lagrangian total pressure ) contain the contribution from the tension force of magnetic field azimuthal component @xcite .",
    "equally important , the contribution from the centrifugal force of rotation should be taken into account in the boundary condition of lagrangian total pressure , which was neglected in previous studies .    here",
    "we study the khi of twisted and rotating magnetic jets in the approximation of incompressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) using the appropriate boundary condition of lagrangian total pressure .",

    "( [ omegas ] ) rearranging it ( the expression ) in the form @xmath179 the corresponding green curve lies , as is naturally to expect , between the two computed from the wave dispersion relation pieces of growth rate curves .",
    "if one extends the @xmath176-axis to @xmath164 or @xmath166 the difference between blue and red curves becomes invisible .",

    "note that the criterion for dense jets , eq .",
    "( [ criterion5 ] ) , gives a little bit higher values for the threshold ratio @xmath155 , and subsequently , higher threshold velocity twist parameters .",

    "it is not surprising the similarity of pictures in these two figures .",
    "the only distinct issue is the circumstance that the instability @xmath176-range for the @xmath180 harmonic is wider than that for the fluting - like mode .",
    "note that while the growth rate curves in both figures are visibly distinguishable , the dispersion curves are very close to each other in their common parts ( see the right panels in figs .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "moreover , there is an impression that for a fixed value of @xmath154 there exists a ` universal ' dispersion curve along which the dispersion curves for various values of @xmath153 lie .",
    "it is not surprising too , that for the @xmath196 mode we obtain curves similar to those plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] as one can see from fig .",

    "one can obtain a more reasonable values if we define the actual wave phase velocity as @xmath197 for small @xmath176 , it is the azimuthal propagation ( that is , @xmath13 ) which defines the wave phase velocity . with this new definition of @xmath198 , the growth rates and dispersion curves plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] take the forms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] . as seen from that figure ,",
    "the values of both growth rates and phase velocities are significantly reduced .",
    "the same is undoubtedly valid for the @xmath158 mhd mode , too .",
    "final conclusion is that the numerical solutions of the dispersion equation ( [ dispersion ] ) perfectly agree with analytical instability criteria .",
    "recent observations with high spatial and temporal resolutions revealed various jets and flows in the solar atmosphere .",
    "some of the observed jets show rotational motion , which may lead to khi due to jump of azimuthal velocity near boundary .",
    "it is obvious that both axial and azimuthal components may take part in the instability depending on the value of velocity speed and the strength of magnetic field in jets .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the flow - aligned magnetic field stabilizes sub - alfvnic motions .",
    "therefore , the structure of magnetic field in jets is crucial for possible onset of the instability .",
    "the main limitation of our study is the use of linear incompressible mhd equations in order to derive the dispersion relation governing the dynamics of rotating and twisted tubes . when the perturbations grow further in time",
    ", then nonlinear effects as well as secondary instabilities in kh vortices may lead to magnetic reconnection with consecutive heating of plasma .",
    "inclusion of compressibility can have either stabilizing or destabilizing effect , depending on the stationary state of motion @xcite .",
    "therefore , it may change the instability criteria and growth rates .",
    "viscosity may also change the instability criteria and it turns out to have a destabilizing influence when the viscosity coefficient takes different values at the two sides of the discontinuity @xcite .",
    "all these effects are absent in our simplified model , which only shows the growth of instability in its initial phase in ideal incompressible plasma .",
    "nonlinear and compressible effects may be included in mhd studies of khi ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this study",
    "we corrected the boundary condition for lagrangian total pressure adding the contribution from the centrifugal force , which has been neglected in previous studies ( see subsection 2.1 ) .",
    "long wavelength approximation of dispersion equation ( [ crit4a ] ) showed that the rotation of non - twisted tubes is always unstable to khi , but a sufficiently strong twist may stabilize the instability .",
    "we found that a twisted rotating rarified jet is unstable to khi when the kinetic energy of rotation exceeds the magnetic energy of twist ( see inequality ( [ criterion4a ] ) ) . in the case of dense jet , however , the magnetic energy is multiplied by the azimuthal wave mode number , @xmath13 ( see inequality ( [ criterion4 ] ) ) .",
    "hence the harmonics with sufficiently high @xmath13 are always stable .",
    "numerical solutions to the dispersion relation perfectly match with analytical formulas in all cases .",
    "instability criteria derived in this paper can be used to estimate the value of azimuthal magnetic field , which may stabilize khi in various jets with observed rotational motion .",

    "therefore , the azimuthal magnetic field of @xmath11@xmath1  g , which stabilizes khi , is below the threshold for the kink instability . using a magnetic field longitudinal component of @xmath204@xmath205  g leads to an alfvn speed of @xmath8@xmath9  kms@xmath4 .",
    "hence , the observed longitudinal motion of @xmath8  kms@xmath4 can be stabilized by a longitudinal magnetic field of @xmath204@xmath205  g. this means that macrospicules will be completely stable to khi instability for both , axial and azimuthal motions , if the azimuthal component of the magnetic field is @xmath207  g. however , @xcite observed the rotational speed of @xmath8  kms@xmath4 in a macrospicule , which leads to a threshold value of azimuthal magnetic field of @xmath12  g. this is already near the limit of kink instability , which means that the macrospicule could be unstable either to the kink instability if azimuthal magnetic field is stronger than @xmath12  g or to the khi if the azimuthal field is less than @xmath12  g. @xcite did not observe the kink instability as it might quickly destroy the macrospicule .",

    "@xcite observed rotational motions of the order of @xmath213  kms@xmath4 , which yields the threshold value of azimuthal magnetic field component as @xmath214  g. therefore , the azimuthal magnetic field of @xmath215  g stabilizes khi of rotational motion in x - ray jets observed by @xcite .",

    "axial magnetic field of @xmath12  g leads to an alfvn speed of @xmath219  kms@xmath4 , which is comparable or less than the axial speed of the jets , therefore the axial motion of the jet can be unstable to khi .",
    "for observed rotational motion of @xmath218  kms@xmath4 , the threshold value of the azimuthal magnetic field component , which may stabilize the khi of rotational motion , is @xmath220  g. this implies that the jet should be significantly twisted in order to be stable to khi .",
    "consequently , both axial and azimuthal velocity components could be unstable in the jet observed by @xcite .",
    "_ giant tornadoes _ are believed to exhibit rotational motions @xcite , however , it was questioned by @xcite considering as an illusion effect .",
    "there is no common agreement on this topic .",
    "@xcite and @xcite estimated the rotation velocity as @xmath2  kms@xmath4 and @xmath1  kms@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "for a typical prominence s density of @xmath221  g@xmath200 , the threshold azimuthal magnetic field can be estimated as @xmath222  g and @xmath223  g for the rotational motions of @xmath1  kms@xmath4 and @xmath2  kms@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "thus the azimuthal component of @xmath215 g may suppress khi related to the observed rotation in giant tornadoes .",
    "@xcite estimated a rising speed of tornado as @xmath224  kms@xmath4 , which is much smaller than the typical alfvn speed in prominences , therefore the axial motion of giant tornadoes probably is also stable to khi .",
    "besides the jets , khi can be important in transverse waves and oscillations , which have azimuthal velocity components .",
    "torsional alfvn and kink waves have jumps of azimuthal velocity near tube boundaries and hence can be unstable .",
    "the onset of instability depends on spatial structure of azimuthal magnetic field and velocity perturbations .",
    "azimuthal velocity and magnetic field components are in phase difference of @xmath225 for propagating waves , therefore their antinodes coincide with each other ( the azimuthal velocity has maximum at the maximum of the azimuthal magnetic field but with opposite sign ) .",
    "consequently , the azimuthal velocity is stabilized by the azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "therefore , both , propagating alfvn and kink waves are stable to khi .",
    "on the other hand , the azimuthal velocity and magnetic field components are in phase difference of @xmath226 for standing waves , therefore the azimuthal magnetic field is zero near at the antinode of velocity .",
    "consequently , the standing kink and torsional alfvn waves are always unstable to khi near antinodes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been often observed in numerical simulations of standing kink oscillations @xcite .",
    "the jets , which show clear rotational motions , could be twisted in order to suppress khi . however , if the magnetic field in the jets is not twisted , then the rotation inevitably leads to instability .",
    "it is important to estimate the growth time of khi in the different cases of jets . from eq .",
    "( [ omegas ] ) one can obtain the growth time for different @xmath13 harmonics as ( here we suppose non - twisted jets ) @xmath227 where @xmath14 is the radius of jet and @xmath228 is the azimuthal velocity at the jet boundary .",
    "for the macrospicule of @xcite ( radius of @xmath229  km and rotation speed of @xmath8  kms@xmath4 ) , the growth times of @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 harmonics are @xmath1 , @xmath233 , and @xmath234  s , respectively . for the type ii spicules of @xcite ( radius of @xmath9  km and rotation speed of @xmath205  kms@xmath4 )",

    "harmonics are @xmath239 , @xmath240 , and @xmath241  s , respectively .",
    "hence , the growth time of khi in spicules and macrospicules is of the order of seconds , while in euv and x - ray jets is of the order of minutes .",
    "kh vortices excited near the boundary of the jets may lead to plasma turbulence and energy cascade to small scales , which may eventually heat the surrounding plasma .",
    "therefore , the rotating jets could be important for chromospheric and coronal heating .",
    "for example , type ii spicules show very short live time of the order of @xmath12@xmath242  s and the estimated growth time of khi is of the order of @xmath0@xmath235  s. hence the developed turbulence and secondary reconnections due to the kh vortices may lead to the heating of plasma and consequently to the disappearance of the spicules . in this regard",
    ", we note recent observations of fast disappearance of rres and rbes by @xcite , which has been interpreted by the heating of the structures due to the khi at their boundary during the transverse motion .",
    "we have studied the khi of rotating magnetized jets using incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations . applying correct boundary condition for lagrangian total pressure ( see subsection 2.1 ) , we obtained dispersion equation , which was solved analytically and numerically .",
    "we found that a rotating and twisted tube is unstable to khi when the kinetic energy of rotation exceeds the magnetic energy of twist .",
    "instability criterion for dense tubes is @xmath243 where @xmath228 and @xmath244 are the rotation speed and azimuthal magnetic field strength at the jet surface , @xmath245 is the jet density and @xmath13 is the azimuthal wave mode number . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> observations show various jets in the solar atmosphere with significant rotational motions , which may undergo instabilities leading to heat ambient plasma . </S>",
    "<S> we study the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability of twisted and rotating jets caused by the velocity jumps near the jet surface . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a dispersion equation with appropriate boundary condition for total pressure ( including centrifugal force of tube rotation ) , which governs the dynamics of incompressible jets . </S>",
    "<S> then , we obtain analytical instability criteria of kelvin - helmholtz instability in various cases , which were verified by numerical solutions to the dispersion equation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that twisted and rotating jets are unstable to kh instability when the kinetic energy of rotation is more than the magnetic energy of the twist . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the azimuthal magnetic field of @xmath0@xmath1  g can stabilize observed rotations in spicule / macrospicules and x - ray / euv jets . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> non - twisted jets are always unstable to kh instability . in this case , the instability growth time is several seconds for spicule / macrospicules and few minutes ( or less ) for euv / x - ray jets . we also find that standing kink and torsional alfvn waves are always unstable near the antinodes due to the jump of azimuthal velocity at the surface , while the propagating waves are generally stable . </S>",
    "<S> kh vortices may lead to enhanced turbulence development and heating of surrounding plasma , therefore rotating jets may provide energy for chromospheric and coronal heating . </S>"
