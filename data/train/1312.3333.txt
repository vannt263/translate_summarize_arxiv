    "accreting black holes in binary systems are variable on many time scales . in the long term , they are observed to undergo changes in state as the mass accretion rate changes , from a bright state dominated by soft thermal emission , to a low - luminosity state dominated by a hard power - law spectrum ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these large - scale changes are interpreted @xcite as the inner part of the accretion disk switching from an optically thick and geometrically thin disk @xcite to an optically thin and geometrically thick disk , or adaf @xcite .    on shorter timescales ,",
    "the power spectra of observed accreting black holes consist of broad band noise spanning a large range of frequencies between a low and high break frequency plus , in some cases , sharper , narrower features known as quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos , see @xcite for a review )",
    ". both components can be well - described by a series of lorentzians @xcite , but the physical mechanisms by which the lorentzian components are produced are poorly understood .",
    "models for the broad band noise require a mechanism which produces variability over a large range of dynamical time- and length - scales .",
    "the magneto - rotational instability ( mri , @xcite ) , for example , creates turbulence in the accretion flow and is believed to be responsible for angular momentum transport in accretion disks .",
    "this mhd turbulence does indeed generate fluctuations over a broad range of timescales @xcite and thus could potentially produce the sort of broad - band , power - law power spectrum that is typically observed .",
    "proposed mechanisms for qpos are many and varied , including ( but not limited to ) tilted accretion flows @xcite , diskoseismic oscillations @xcite and resonances in the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "identifying features in the power spectrum of an accreting black hole could characterize special frequencies in the disk related to the black - hole mass or spin .",
    "for example , for a black hole of known mass , the identification of a power spectral feature with the orbital frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the accretion disk would indicate the black - hole spin @xmath0 , since disks around black holes with higher spin have smaller iscos .",

    "we examine how the variability properties change with the observer s inclination and choice of photon energy band and identify power spectral features that may hint at black hole properties . in section [ sec : methods ] , we describe the simulations themselves as well as the methods by which we produce the observed lightcurves and power spectra . in section [ sec : results ] , we investigate a high - frequency feature in the power spectrum , determine its origin , and show how it changes with spin , inclination , and energy .",
    "we discuss the implications for observers who seek to characterize black holes in section [ sec : discuss ] , and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .    throughout , we use standard gravitational units and set @xmath7 .",

    "similarly , our unit of time is also @xmath8 , which corresponds to a physical unit of @xmath10 .",
    "in this paper , we analyze simulations of accretion disks around black holes with three different spin parameters : @xmath11 .",
    "the simulations are performed using the 3d grmhd code harm @xcite in a kerr spacetime with the appropriate value of @xmath0 .",
    "these are the same simulations analyzed by @xcite and @xcite , but have been run longer .",
    "simulation length and other parameters are shown in table [ tab : sims ] .",
    "each simulation is initialized with an orbiting torus of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in the equatorial plane around the black hole .",
    "the gas is evolved according to the grmhd equations and is driven to steady - state accretion via mhd turbulence that emerges as a result of the mri .",
    "this initial part of the simulation before inflow equilibrium is reached is not considered in the analysis that follows .",
    "additionally , the simulations are only converged ( at a steady @xmath12 ) out to 15 - 20 @xmath8 , so we disregard the region outside the radius of convergence .",
    "the code harm does not include radiative transfer . in the present work , we use an ad hoc cooling prescription @xcite",
    "whereby we effectively set the thickness of the disk .",
    "( section [ ssec : emission ] describes how we reconstruct the emergent spectrum . )",
    "all three simulations discussed here are thin disks with @xmath13 .      in order to produce the light curves that would be seen by a distant observer",
    ", we need to trace the paths taken by photons that are emitted at the disk midplane and navigate the curved spacetime around the black hole .",
    "the strong gravity around the black hole deflects the paths of photons and produces a warped image for a distant observer , see figure [ fig : imgincline ] for examples . to reproduce this , we construct an elliptical grid in the observer s image plane and follow the paths of photons back to their places of origin , as described by @xcite .",
    "initial conditions for the position vector of each ray are given by their location in the image plane , and initial conditions for the momentum vector are given by assuming that the observer is sufficiently far away from the black hole that all photons travel parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the trajectory of the ray from each grid cell in the image plane is evolved along null geodesics in a kerr spacetime until the ray strikes the plane of the disk or crosses the event horizon and is lost .",
    "then , knowing the location at which the ray struck ( or emerged from ) the disk as well as the strike angle , we reconstruct the emergent spectrum .     = 25 m , at several inclinations .",
    "colors indicate bolometric intensity in arbitrary but consistent units .",
    "as inclination increases , the image becomes warped as photon geodesics are deflected by the strong gravity near the black hole .",
    "also , the doppler effect becomes sharper , boosting the left side of the disk where the orbital velocity points toward the observer . ]",
    "we use the stellar atmospheres code tlusty @xcite , which has been adapted to the problem of black hole accretion disks ( see @xcite ) , to calculate the radiation spectrum emerging from each disk annulus .",
    "tlusty treats annuli in the accretion disk as one - dimensional plane - parallel atmospheres . under the assumption that the atmosphere is in hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "the code solves for both the radiation field and the vertical structure of the annulus in the local comoving frame of the gas .",
    "free - free , free - bound , and bound - free radiative processes are all included , as well as an angle averaged kompaneets treatment of compton scattering @xcite .",
    "the physics of magnetic pressure support , convection , and heat conduction are , however , neglected .",
    "deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium are allowed and the level populations for h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe are explicitly computed via relevant rate equations ( under the assumption of solar abundances ) . only the lowest ionization energy level is considered for each ionization state , except for h and he where we include the lowest 9 and 4 levels respectively .    with a final assumption that the local viscous heating is proportional to gas density , tlusty allows the full range of disk annuli to be encapsulated with just three parameters @xcite : ( i ) the vertical column mass @xmath14 , ( ii ) the vertical tidal gravity @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the vertical component of the gravitational acceleration and @xmath17 is height above the midplane , and ( iii ) the total emerging flux @xmath18 . with these three parameters and knowledge of the angle",
    "at which the ray emerges from the disk , the emergent spectrum is fully determined .",
    "note that tlusty computes the emerging intensity as a function of the angle of the ray with respect to the surface normal so that limb darkening is calculated self - consistently .",
    "( at very high inclinations where @xmath19 , however , this method would not be valid since the radii at which the ray intersects the midplane and the photosphere would differ significantly . )",
    "since the properties of each annulus are uniquely specified by only three parameters , we have constructed a large precomputed grid of annuli to span the full parameter range for stellar - mass black - hole accretion disks . in this work",
    ", we make use of a grid of over 40,000 tlusty models that were developed in @xcite .",
    "the use of a precomputed grid provides a significant computational time advantage ; the overall spectra of many different disk models can be quickly computed by interpolating models from this grid . when the atmosphere is optically thick",
    ", the spectra produced by these annuli will resemble a blackbody ( plus an extended non - wien tail from non - saturated comptonization ) , but we are not limited to cases of high optical depth - the code has the advantage of handling optically thin atmospheres as well .",
    "the strike angle comes from the raytracing as described above and @xmath20 is simply a function of @xmath21 ; the other parameters must be retrieved from the simulation . because the simulation is 3d , while the procedure described above requires a flat disk , @xmath22 and @xmath14 are collapsed to the midplane along @xmath17 .",
    "the effective temperature at a point on the 2d disk is calculated by finding the total flux emitted within a vertical column .",
    "similarly , the column density is calculated by summing up the mass in all the cells in that column ; see @xcite for details .",
    "having calculated these parameters for each midplane cell in the simulation , we retrieve the spectrum emitted in the fluid frame at the location where each ray strikes the disk using the appropriate pre - computed tlusty model .",
    "finally , we calculate the observed spectrum by applying a redshift which is determined by the radius , strike angle , and orbital velocity as described by @xcite .",
    "this redshift accounts both for gravitational redshift and the doppler shift .",
    "the effect of the doppler shift is visible in figure [ fig : imgincline ] .",
    "a highly - inclined observer for whom the disk is rotating counter - clockwise will see bright , doppler - boosted emission on the left where a large component of the fluid velocity is directed toward the line of sight .",
    "conversely , on the right , emission is boosted away from the observer and the disk is dim .",
    "we have tested the method described in sections [ ssec : raytracing]-[ssec : emission ] and shown that it accurately recovers the emission produced by a novikov - thorne model disk ; see appendix [ app : nt ] for details .",
    "= 25 m , in several photon energy bands .",
    "units of flux and intensity are arbitary but consistent within this figure and with figure  [ fig : imgincline ] . as the band moves to higher photon energies ,",
    "the lightcurves and images are dominated by fluctuations at small radii . ]      the observed flux at a particular time is calculated by integrating over the disk in the image plane using the spectra retrieved as described in section [ ssec : emission ] . the light curves shown in this paper do not take into account the differences in light travel times between photons emitted at different locations on the disk .",
    "similar to @xcite , we found that including the delays has a negligible effect on the light curves and power spectra for a 10 @xmath23 black hole , so we ignore them to make the computation more straightforward .",
    "figure [ fig : lcbands ] shows sample light curves at different photon energy bands . a band which is in the rayleigh - jeans regime for the temperatures in the disk ( such as",
    "the 1 - 2 kev panels at the top ) varies smoothly over a broad range of radii , whereas a higher - energy band in the wien regime ( lower panels ) is dominated by fluctuations in the hottest , innermost radii .    at high energies ,",
    "the spectral energy distribution is steep , so a small change in temperature results in a large change in intensity ; this causes much larger variability in the light curves .",
    "the primary tool used to characterize variability in x - ray binary systems is the power spectrum @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fourier transform of the lightcurve . following this practice",
    ", we use a fast fourier transform method to compute the discrete fourier transform and power spectrum of our light curves , which have temporal resolution @xmath26 = 5 m ( the output cadence of the simulation , which corresponds to @xmath27 250 @xmath28s for a 10 m@xmath29 black hole ) .",
    "we are able to substantially reduce the noise in the power spectrum by segmenting the light curves into @xmath30 = 2 - 4 pieces before taking the fft and averaging the resulting power spectra together .",
    "we then rebin the power spectra in frequency in such a way that each bin has equal size in @xmath31 , averaging the power spectral components in each bin .",
    "then the error in the power spectrum is estimated to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of fft bins contributing to each power spectrum frequency .",
    "typical values for @xmath33 within a single power spectrum range from a few at the low - frequency end to @xmath34 at the high - frequency end ( due to the logarithmic spacing of the bins ) , such that the uncertainty in the calculated power spectrum ranges from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the power spectra are well - described by one or more underlying power laws plus an apparent qpo around @xmath37 and an additional broad feature from @xmath38 which is stronger at higher inclinations . for a 10@xmath23 black hole",
    ", a frequency of @xmath39 corresponds to about 200 hz . the orbital frequency at the isco is plotted as a vertical dashed line ; note that the broad feature is centered at a lower frequency , which suggests that the power originates at radii outside the isco . ]    in addition , we suppress leakage between frequencies by applying a welch window to each segment , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of points in each segment and @xmath42 is the time index . because the welch window de - weights the points at the ends of the segments , it effectively removes the information they carry from the power spectrum . to compensate for this , we take an additional @xmath43 segments which are offset from the original segments by half their length , and average these into the power spectra as well so that no information is lost @xcite .",
    "examples of the resulting power spectra are shown in figure [ fig : pspecincl ] .",
    "the power spectra we obtain from our simulated lightcurves are characterized by three components , which can be seen for the non - spinning case in figure [ fig : pspecincl ] :    * an underlying power law . * a qpo at low frequencies , @xmath44 ( @xmath4510 hz for a 10 @xmath23 black hole ) . * a broad feature contributing extra power at higher frequencies , breaking off around @xmath39 ( @xmath45200 hz for a 10 @xmath23 black hole ) .    as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , the underlying power law @xmath46 may be representative of the constant fluctuations caused by mhd turbulence associated with the mri .",
    "the power law index from the simulations ( @xmath47 ) is steeper than typically observed or predicted ( @xmath48 ) , and the process producing it remains to to be precisely characterized .",
    "( for a discussion of several possible mathematical models for the underlying variability , see @xcite , who also find a high - frequency feature similar to ours . )",
    "the qpo is present for all spins and at all inclinations .",
    "it also remains in approximately the same location throughout , though it moves slightly with spin from @xmath4516 hz for @xmath0 = 0 to @xmath4510 hz for @xmath0 = 0.7 and @xmath456 hz for @xmath0 = 0.9 . in this paper",
    "we focus on understanding the origin of the high - frequency feature and defer discussion of the qpo to a future paper .",
    "the effect on the broad high - frequency feature of changing the observer s inclination is evident in figure [ fig : pspecincl ] .",
    "as inclination increases , the feature becomes more and more prominent .",
    "these changes with inclination strongly suggest that the doppler effect is of great importance for this feature - as the observer becomes more inclined with respect to the disk , the component of orbital motion along the line of sight increases , strengthening the boost supplied by the doppler effect . as a result , at high inclinations the radii closest to the black hole possessing the highest orbital velocities are emphasized .    , blue ) and at high inclination",
    "( @xmath49 , red ) to the accretion disk of a black hole with @xmath0 = 0.9 . bottom panels : the same power spectra , broken down by radius of origin of the photons . at high inclination",
    ", each annulus contributes additional power at its orbital frequency ( black line ) , which results in the broad high - frequency feature in the combined power spectrum . ]",
    "an examination of the power spectra broken down by radius confirms this emphasis on smaller radii .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig:2dpspec ] , at high inclination each annulus contributes additional power at its own orbital frequency ( the black line on the bottom two panels ) .",
    "this excess is not present for a face - on observer .",
    "physically , this can be understood to mean that there are structures in the accretion disk which survive for at least one orbital period .",
    "as a feature passes through the left side of the disk it experiences a doppler boost and appears brighter , then dims as it passes on the right , and brightens again as it comes back around , repeating this process as long as the structure is present and thereby producing periodicity at the orbital frequency .",
    "based on this explanation , we refer to the resulting feature in the power spectrum as the  doppler feature . \"    because the orbital frequency changes as a function of radius , the doppler feature is necessarily broad , extending up to the orbital frequency of the radius which dominates the variability",
    ". this radius does not appear to change with inclination or the energy band in which the disk is observed ( except perhaps at the highest spin ) , though these two quantities do certainly affect how pronounced the feature is .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : pspecband ] , the doppler feature is present at all energies , both soft and hard .",
    "moving to higher energies increases the prominence of the feature , since the spectrum is steep at those energies and a small change in temperature produces a larger change in intensity than in the lower - energy bands where the spectrum is shallower .",
    "the location of the doppler feature does change with spin , however , moving to higher frequencies as spin increases ( see table [ tab : sims ] ) . at higher spins , circular orbits are stable closer to the black hole , so the inner edge of the accretion disk reaches smaller , hotter , and faster - moving radii .",
    "accordingly , the higher orbital frequencies of these radii are visible in the power spectrum . a priori",
    ", one might expect the doppler feature to be dominated by the orbital frequency of the isco , but this is not the case .",
    "in fact , the feature tends to peak or break at frequencies corresponding to radii up to @xmath50 m _ outside _ the isco , implying that there is another location in the disk which is dominant , and necessitating a more detailed explanation .",
    "the location of the break is affected not only by the strength of the doppler effect , which increases towards smaller radii , but also by the emissivity of the disk , which peaks further out . in the following sections , we model the shape of the doppler feature as a function of spin , inclination , and temperature profile , and",
    "show how its break lies between the orbital frequencies at the isco and at the peak of emissivity .",
    "as a hotspot travels around the disk , its intensity as seen by an inclined observer is modulated by the doppler effect .",
    "of course , for a smooth , non - fluctuating disk , this modulation will not produce any variability ; some background fluctuations ( such as those provided by the mhd turbulence ) are required .",
    "thus the strength of the signal from the doppler effect for a given radius will depend on ( i ) the strength of the underlying fluctuation , @xmath51 , ( ii ) the orbital frequency @xmath52 , and ( iii ) the observer s inclination .",
    "the observer s inclination is known and the orbital frequency is easily determined analytically , but @xmath51 is not as obvious .    in the simulations , we have found that fluctuations in temperature within an annulus are approximately normally distributed , with a half - width half - max @xmath53 which is consistent across all radii .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : dt ] . )",
    "this means that the typical size of fluctuations in a given annulus scales with the typical flux at that radius .",
    "given an orbital frequency @xmath52 and temperature profile @xmath54 , we can therefore estimate the doppler power as a function of radius for an observer at any inclination .    in the absence of any lensing effects ( an approximation which is obviously crude , but which simplifies the analysis ) , the total flux for an observer at an angle @xmath55 to the disk is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the distance to the observer and @xmath58 is the intensity emitted at the observer s photon energy @xmath59 at the location @xmath60 on the disk midplane at time @xmath61 . since we have determined from the simulations that the typical scale of fluctuations is independent of radius , we treat @xmath62 as the sum of constant and time - varying parts @xmath63,\\ ] ] where the second term represents a fluctuation of scale @xmath64 which orbits in the disk with frequency @xmath52 .    to apply a known disk emission profile",

    ", we find that the time - varying component of the flux @xmath77 changes with @xmath21 as @xmath78 \\frac{\\cos[\\phi - \\omega(r)t]}{(1+z)^3}.\\ ] ] given a choice of @xmath65 , this integral is fully specified and may be evaluated numerically . in the following analysis",
    ", we use a blackbody , @xmath79,$ ] so that all that remains is a choice of temperature profile . for direct comparison with simulation results",
    ", we use the temperature profiles recovered from the simulation , but any reasonable profile ( e.g. , a novikov - thorne profile ) will provide similar results .    the variable part of the flux @xmath80 at a radius @xmath21 follows a sinusoidal pattern as the fluctuation travels around the disk , providing power at the orbital frequency @xmath52 , with the amount of power scaling with the amplitude of the sinusoid . the relevant quantity for comparison with the power spectrum",
    "@xmath81 is the amplitude of @xmath82 , which can be derived from @xmath83 as @xmath84    finally , we note that in the simulation , the intrinsic variability present in the disk is more complicated than the simple cosine assumed above .",
    "the fluctuations are not constant nor are they of a single size ; rather , they have a range of sizes as shown in figure [ fig : dt ] and appear and decay over many timescales .",
    "thus , for a face - on observer , this intrinsic variability appears in the power spectrum not as a single delta function , but as a power law over a broad range of frequencies .",
    "for inclined observers , this variability will be modulated ( or multiplied ) by the boosts supplied by the doppler effect , and in fourier space , this multiplication becomes a convolution . before making the comparison with simulations , therefore , we convolve our estimate of the doppler power with a power law extending to higher frequencies to produce a final estimate of the shape of the doppler feature @xmath85 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the power law exponent at high frequencies that we fit to the simulated power spectrum for a face - on observer .        the result of this estimation can be seen in figure [ fig : breakloc ] . in each column , the top panel shows the power spectrum calculated directly from the simulation . in the bottom two sets of panels",
    ", we try to replicate the behavior of the power spectra analytically as described above - the central panels show our estimate of the doppler feature @xmath85 while the bottom panels combine this estimate with the power spectrum for a face - on observer . @xmath85 peaks at frequencies consistent with the breaks that appear in the simulations . because of the strong dependence on redshift @xmath72 ( which is a function of inclination @xmath55 ) it is stronger at higher inclination , and at high spin the location of the peak changes slightly with inclination as well .",
    "the top and bottom sets of panels are in good agreement , indicating that we have identified the origin of the high - frequency feature . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss how this may apply to observations .",
    "observations of accreting black holes are typically sorted into `` states , '' determined by their x - ray flux and spectral hardness .",
    "the canonical states are the `` thermal , '' `` hard , '' `` quiescent , '' and `` steep power law '' states @xcite , though there exist many intermediate forms as well @xcite .",
    "our simulated disks most closely correspond to accreting black holes in the thermal or spl state , as they are dominated by thin accretion disks at high accretion rates ( @xmath88 ) and thus high luminosities . in all states ,",
    "the power spectra can be described by the superposition of several lorentzian components @xcite , bounded by a low - frequency component at one end and two high - frequency components on the other .",
    "qpos are represented as lorentzians with a high quality factor @xmath20 and are sharply peaked .",
    "because we have only 40000 m ( 2 seconds for a 10 m@xmath29 black hole ) of simulation data at best , we can only compare to the high - frequency end of the observed power spectra .",
    "in particular , our highest - frequency feature ought to correspond to the highest - frequency component for observed black hole binaries .",
    "we have seen in section [ sec : results ] that the power spectra from our simulated disks have a feature at high frequencies which is induced by the orbital motion of structures in the disk and highlighted by the doppler effect .",
    "the strength and location of this doppler feature is affected by four quantities : the inclination of the observer , the energy band used by the observer , the black hole mass , and the black hole spin .    as discussed in section [ sec : results ] , the observer s inclination with respect to the disk as well as the energy band chosen by the observer each affect the strength of the doppler feature in the power spectrum . as the feature is a direct result of the doppler effect",
    ", a more inclined observer has a larger component of the fluid velocity along the line of sight , a higher doppler factor , and thus a stronger power spectral feature ( figure [ fig : extrapow ] ) .",
    "moving to high energies also enhances the feature : past the peak of the blackbody , the radiation spectrum becomes steeper so that the shifts in frequency provided by the doppler effect produce a larger shift in intensity than in bands where the radiation spectrum is shallower ( figure [ fig : pspecband ] ) .",
    "we have shown in figure [ fig : breakloc ] that the location of the doppler feature agrees with the peak of the function @xmath89 derived in section [ ssec : model ] , which estimates the amplitude of doppler modulations of hotspots produced by the temperature fluctuations present in the disk and their contribution to the power at orbital frequencies @xmath52 .",
    "the shape of this function depends on the spin of the black hole , @xmath0 , as well as the temperature profile of the disk , @xmath54 . at higher spins",
    ", the inner edge of the accretion disk extends closer to the black hole , providing access to the higher orbital frequencies at those radii and shifting the peak of @xmath85 to higher frequencies .",
    "this effect is present regardless of the temperature profile chosen .",
    "figure [ fig : spinbreak ] shows the location of the peak for the temperature profiles measured from the simulation @xmath90 as well as an analytical @xmath91 from @xcite , and both choices of temperature profile show the peak moving to higher frequencies with increasing black - hole spin as the accretion disk extends to smaller radii .",
    "observationally , the location of the highest - frequency lorentzian component has been seen to shift to higher frequencies as accreting black holes undergo state transitions from low to high luminosity @xcite , which is consistent with the idea that it represents some dominant radius that moves closer to the black hole as luminosity increases and the truncation radius marking the transition between the thin and thick disks moves inward . at the highest luminosities where",
    "the accretion disk is expected to extend all the way to the isco , therefore , one could potentially use the location of this high - frequency feature to estimate spin in cases where the black hole mass is known",
    ".    one interesting implication of the results shown in figure  [ fig : spinbreak ] is that the variation of the doppler feature frequency with black hole spin @xmath0 , as derived from the simulations ( solid lines ) , is fairly shallow .",
    "this is very different from the much steeper variation predicted by the novikov - thorne model ( dashed lines ) or the orbital frequency at the isco , @xmath92 .",
    "models of high - frequency qpos based on dynamical frequencies in the disk @xcite typically predict steep variations akin to the latter . if the doppler feature described in this paper is relevant to observed qpos , then it is clear that simulation data will play an increasingly important role in interpreting observations .        , peaks as a function of spin for several inclinations .",
    "solid lines correspond to the temperature profiles from the simulations , and dashed lines to novikov - thorne profiles @xcite .",
    "regardless of the specific @xmath54 , the peak shifts to higher frequencies as black hole spin increases .",
    "the orbital frequencies at the isco and at the peak of @xmath93ln@xmath21 ( dotted lines ) are plotted for comparison .",
    "note that the peak of @xmath85 always lies between the two , indicating that its location is a compromise between the strength of the doppler effect and the luminosity profile of the disk . ]",
    "the thin accretion disk simulations presented in this paper represent the state - of - the - art .",
    "nevertheless , they omit some important physics .",
    "notably , the code we used does not include radiative transfer .",
    "instead , radiative cooling is handled via a toy prescription @xcite which is designed to keep the disk geometrically thin .",
    "new codes are currently being developed that can handle radiation grmhd @xcite .",
    "simulations in the future with these codes will provide more reliable profiles of @xmath90 and hence more accurate estimates of the doppler feature frequency .",
    "the origin of the qpo which appears in our power spectra at lower frequencies is as yet undetermined .",
    "it moves to slightly lower frequency as the spin of the black hole increases , which is somewhat unexpected .",
    "it may be that the qpo is an artifact of the simulation , e.g. some characteristic frequency of the torus with which the simulations are initialized , but this remains to be seen .",
    "it is unlikely that the qpo corresponds to any real mode present in the disk , since the mri tends to damp out these modes and there is no obvious mechanism to replenish them in the simulations .",
    "we have shown that our simulated grmhd accretion disks have some of the same variability properties observed in black hole binaries .",
    "these variability properties , in particular the feature observed at high frequencies , are a function of the physical properties of the system such as black - hole mass and spin .",
    "the high - frequency feature originates from the orbital motion in the disk .",
    "hotspots which survive for at least one orbital period are alternately doppler boosted and dimmed for an inclined observer , producing periodicity and hence additional power at orbital frequencies .",
    "this doppler feature peaks or breaks at the orbital frequency of the radius whose doppler fluctuations are dominant , which is a function of spin ( and , to a lesser degree , inclination ) .",
    "this feature is stronger at higher inclinations , where the doppler effect is stronger , and at higher energies past the peak of the blackbody spectrum , where the sed is steep .",
    "thus , given the disk temperature profile ( e.g. , from simulations ) , an observer could potentially use the location of the highest - frequency lorentzian component in the power spectrum to determine the spin of an accreting black hole with known mass .",
    "this procedure would be most plausible in the bright thermal or steep power law states , where the thin disk component is believed to extend all the way down to the isco .    while we were successful in reproducing some of the observed characteristics of accreting black holes and understanding the origin of the highest - frequency feature ,",
    "our understanding of black hole binary variability is far from complete . in particular , the origin of the low - frequency qpo which appears in our power spectra is still unknown .",
    "it is not clear whether it is a consequence of some physical process or an artifact of the simulation . varying the parameters of the simulation itself ( e.g.",
    ", the location of the initial torus ) may reveal whether it is a physical or computational effect .",
    "additionally , increasing the length of the simulations would provide more low - frequency information in the power spectra and help to better characterize this feature .",
    "we will also aim to better describe these accreting black hole systems in the future by introducing more realistic physics into the simulations .",
    "the observed profile of emission would be significantly improved by incorporating full radiative transfer into the simulations , rather than employing our current method of using an ad - hoc cooling prescription and doing radiative transfer in post - processing .",
    "this step is crucial to fully understanding the radiative processes at work .",
    "these goals are very ambitious , but would represent a significant improvement in our ability to faithfully simulate accreting black holes .",

    "to test the raytracing code , we wish to see whether it can accurately recover all of the energy that is emitted at the disk midplane using distant observers scattered around the sky . for an accretion disk with a novikov - thorne flux profile @xmath94 @xcite , we know analytically that the luminosity per radius as observed at infinity is given by @xmath95 where the factor @xmath96 , i.e. the covariant time component of the four - velocity , accounts for gravitational redshift . the goal of this appendix is to reproduce this analytical profile numerically by raytracing back to a novikov - thorne disk to retrieve the derivative @xmath97 at a particular location @xmath98 on the sky , then integrating over observers at all locations on the sky to retrieve the universal derivative @xmath97 .",
    "this is a comprehensive test of our raytracing code .    to compute the derivative @xmath97 for a single observer",
    ", we must integrate over the observer s image plane . in our raytracing code ,",
    "the image plane is an elliptical grid in radial and angular coordinates ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) which is squeezed by a factor of @xmath101 .",
    "the total flux in the image plane at that inclination is therefore @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the intensity at infinity of the ray through the point with coordinates ( @xmath104 ) as recovered from the accretion disk by raytracing .",

    ", we find the flux profile @xmath114 as described above ; then the total observed luminosity profile is @xmath115    one additional correction is needed before we can expect our raytraced @xmath97 to match the analytical profile .",
    "the analytical profile takes the flux produced by the disk and transforms it for an observer at infinity ; it does not account for the fact that some photons never reach infinity but are rather swallowed by the black hole or fall back onto the disk",
    ". these photons will be  missing \" from our raytracing solution . to account for this",
    ", we find the fraction of energy that escapes to infinity by running the raytracing code in the reverse direction , starting on the disk and following the paths of photons outward .",
    "beginning in the rest frame of the fluid at a radius @xmath21 , we distribute rays at equal intervals in @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( fluid - frame coordinates centered at @xmath21 ) and assign them energy proportional to their solid angle @xmath118 times a factor of @xmath119 since we are representing a surface along the midplane . these rays",
    "are then transformed to disk coordinates in the lab frame assuming a novikov - thorne orbital velocity profile and integrated outward along null geodesics .",
    "raytracing is halted when one of three conditions is met : ( i ) the ray reaches the event horizon , ( ii ) the ray passes through the midplane , or ( iii ) the ray reaches some large radius and escapes .",
    "we assign the energy carried by the rays to these three bins and divide by the total energy to get the three fractions @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 which describe the fraction of energy produced at a radius @xmath21 which is swallowed by the black hole , returns to the disk midplane , or escapes to infinity respectively .",
    "these fractions can be seen for disks with spin parameters @xmath123 and 0.9 ( the same spins as our grmhd simulations ) in figure [ fig : nt ] .",
    "rays which meet the third condition and escape to infinity are the only ones accessible by the reverse - raytracing method .",
    "thus , we expect that the analytical and raytraced derivatives @xmath97 should differ by a factor of @xmath122 so that @xmath124 this quantity is plotted in figure [ fig : nt ] , along with the analytical @xmath97 .",
    "a comparison of the two shows very good agreement , which demonstrates that our method captures the emission produced at the disk surface with excellent accuracy .",
    "the redshift we seek to derive is the shift in frequency , @xmath125 for a photon with wave vector @xmath126 between an observer corotating with the disk with some circular four - velocity @xmath127 , and a distant observer with @xmath128 . for a spinning black hole ,",
