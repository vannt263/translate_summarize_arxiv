    "the adiabatic theorem tells us that non - adiabatic excitations become important whenever the rate of change of the hamiltonian is large compare to the splitting between nearby energies . a typical situation when this happens is when two weakly coupled diabatic , or bare , energy levels cross .",
    "the coupling between the corresponding states implies a lifting of the degeneracy and the crossing becomes avoided .",
    "the simplest description of this scenario is captured by the landau - zener ( lz ) model .",
    "being analytically solvable , the lz formula gives an expression for the transition probability when the system is swept through an avoided crossing  @xcite . in the diabatic representation ,",
    "the state vector @xmath0^t$ ] is a solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( @xmath1 ) @xmath2=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\lambda t & u \\\\ u & -\\lambda t\\end{array}\\right]\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\psi_x(t)\\\\ \\psi_y(t)\\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] here , @xmath3 is the sweep velocity and @xmath4 the coupling strength between the two diabatic states . for an initial state @xmath5 , @xmath6",
    ", the probability for transfer from the @xmath7-diabatic state to the @xmath8-diabatic state at @xmath9 is given by the expression @xmath10 with the adiabaticity parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the adiabatic states are the instantaneous eigenstates of the corresponding hamiltonian , and for the lz problem we note that far from the crossing at @xmath12 , the diabatic and adiabatic states coincide up to a swapping of the indices . as mentioned , a slow time - change in comparison to the energy gap , i.e. @xmath13 ( in dimensionless units ) , implies an adiabatic evolution , here seen in the large @xmath14-parameter .",
    "since adiabatic breakdown ( i.e. population transfer between adiabatic states ) occurs predominantly in the close vicinity of the crossing where the diabatic energies are approximately linear , the lz model has seen numerous applications in all possible fields of physics ; in molecular / chemical physics it demonstrates breakdown of the born - oppenheimer approximation  @xcite , in cold atom physics it can be used to explain the decay of bloch oscillations  @xcite or describe the formation of molecules when the gas is driven through a feshbach resonance  @xcite , for solid state josephson junctions lz physics can be used to analyze transport properties  @xcite or interference effects  @xcite , it may also be used to understand critical slowing down and the kibble - zurek mechanism appearing when a system is driven through a critical point  @xcite , and it can be employed for state preparation and coherent control  @xcite .",
    "this said , with ever refined experimental techniques in especially the amo community , more complicated situations can be _ in situ _ studied and as a result extended lz models become relevant .",
    "in this paper we consider a lattice version of a many - body lz ( mblz ) problem , namely ultra cold bosonic atoms loaded into the first excited states , @xmath15-bands , of a square optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "the analysis is carried out at a mean - field level which is not only computationally tractable , but it is also expected to give an accurate picture of current experiments using cold atomic gases in optical lattices . every single lattice site realizes a non - linear ( single particle ) lz system , but tunnelling of atoms from site - to - site makes the full system very complex showing an interplay between intra- and inter - site dynamics .",
    "such coupled dynamics results in a complicated evolution during the lz sweep .",
    "more precisely , there is an intra - site time - scale ( indirectly related to the adiabaticity parameter @xmath14 ) which determines the probability for transitions between the two onsite diabatic states , and there is an inter - site time - scale related to the mobility of particles within the lattice . for physically relevant parameters , intra - site adiabaticity is easier to fulfill than inter - site adiabaticity .",
    "this can be understood since the intra - site dynamics describes a macroscopic flow of atoms within the lattice .",
    "the effect becomes especially clear as the system size is increased , and in fact by taking the thermodynamic limit properly the system hosts an ising - type quantum phase transition which prevents full adiabatic driving due to the critical slowing down mechanism .",
    "the system is particularly interesting since this type of mblz problem is reminiscent of franck - condon physics which typically can be found in pump - probe experiments in molecular and chemical physics  @xcite . here , however , is the external degrees of freedom descritized to the lattice sites and apparently the corresponding ` pump ' ( lz ) process is here taking place for a finite time allowing for external evolution to occur during the ` pumping ' .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way .",
    "the system hamiltonian , and its physical realization in terms of cold @xmath15-band atoms , is introduced in the following section , where also the idea of the mean - field approach is outlined .",
    "some general remarks on the lattice problem is also given in sec .",
    "the results for the many - site problem are reported in sec  [ mssec ] . to better understand the interplay between intra- and inter - site dynamics we start by analyzing the ground state properties and",
    "then turn the attention to the time - dependent mblz problem .",
    "we conclude with a summary in sec .",
    "[ seccon ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the model that supports different internal and external characteristic time - scales .",
    "effective models describing the mblz problems discussed in this paper could arise in various physical systems like trapped spinor condensates in optical lattices  @xcite , ion traps  @xcite , impurity - bec systems in double - wells  @xcite , or atomic condensates occupying higher energy bands of optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the following derivation considers the last option , more precisely an ultracold gas of bosonic atoms loaded into the @xmath15-bands ( first excited ) of a square optical lattice .",
    "the reason for this choice is because the two time - scales appear naturally in this system .",
    "the specific system is presented next by deriving the corresponding many - body hamiltonian . from the many - body hamiltonian",
    "it is straightforward to arrive at the effective model used in this paper by introducing the coherent state ansatz wave - function and from there on obtain the mean - field equations of motion .",
    "we consider bosonic atoms of mass @xmath16 free to move in a 2d periodic potential .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian reads @xmath17 where the potential @xmath18 with @xmath19 consists of the optical lattice and the external trapping potentials respectively , with @xmath20 being the lattice wave number and @xmath21 the trap frequency .",

    "we will work with dimensionless variables where the recoil energy @xmath24 sets the energy scale giving a characteristic length @xmath25 and time @xmath26 .",
    "the scaled dimensionless variables / parameters become @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    for the isotropic 2d lattice , every",
    "lattice site hosts two degenerate atomic orbital states , the @xmath32- and @xmath33-orbitals .",
    "these orbitals represent the single site atomic states and are given by the wannier functions .",
    "since we have two of them for every site , we can think of the single site state as a spin-1/2 or qubit particle , but it should be remembered that the spatial dependence of the orbitals is important for giving a full description of the atomic states . just like the eigenstates of an isotropic 2d harmonic oscillator , the @xmath32-orbital state is roughly gaussian in the @xmath8-direction and has a single node in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "its width is larger in the direction of the node , i.e. the @xmath7-direction .",
    "the same properties apply for the @xmath33-orbital but with the two directions swapped .",
    "naturally , the shapes of these orbitals ( wannier functions ) will play an important role for the dynamics of the system .    from the single particle hamiltonian ( [ spham ] ) we continue by applying the second quantization procedure .",

    "@xmath59 are assumed the same between the two orbitals , while by tuning @xmath60 and @xmath61 externally the onsite energy becomes time - dependent and we can drive the lz sweep . in principle also the other parameters will be altered by tuning the amplitudes @xmath60 and @xmath61 , but this effect will be much smaller than the change in @xmath59 , and we can safely ignore such dependences . in the isotropic case and in the harmonic approximation ,",
    "i.e. @xmath62 with @xmath63 the width and similarly for @xmath64 , the interaction strengths obey @xmath65 .",
    "therefor , we have defined @xmath66 to parametrize all interaction terms . the effect of the trap , appearing as the last term in eq .",
    "( [ kinterm ] ) , where we have assumed that the trap varies minimally on the length scale of the lattice , i.e. the trap does not directly induce tunnelling between lattice sites . in this approximation",
    "we just replace @xmath67 and @xmath68 with the positions of the site @xmath44 .",
    "finally we make a remark about the tunnelling coefficients @xmath69 which give the amplitude for an @xmath45-orbital particle to tunnel in the @xmath56-direction . due to the anisotropic shape of the orbitals ,",
    "the tunnelling strength of say a @xmath32-orbital in the @xmath7-direction , @xmath70 , is not the same as for tunnelling in the @xmath8-direction , @xmath71 .",
    "using the particular shapes of the wannier functions on the @xmath15-bands it follows that @xmath72 , and if we pick @xmath73 we have that @xmath74 .",
    "for our purposes it is enough to consider the orbital symmetric situation @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( corresponding to the isotropic lattice ) .",
    "another consequence of the shapes of the @xmath77 s is that tunnelling can not accompany a change of orbital states ( in general such tunnelings describe spin - orbit couplings or so called dzyaloshinskii - moriya processes ) , instead orbital states are only interchanged via scattering of two @xmath32-orbitals into two @xmath33-orbitals or vice versa , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ ocint ] ) .",
    "experimentally , atoms prepared in the ground state , the @xmath23-band , can be loaded into the @xmath15-bands via a two photon raman pulse  @xcite , and there they would be let to relax into a @xmath15-band ( quasi ) ground state .",
    "such relaxation is indeed very fast - a few tunnelling times  @xcite .",
    "this implies that it takes place on a much shorter time scale than other decay mechanisms .",
    "the lattice will initially be anisotropic ( @xmath78 ) such that all atoms populate mainly one orbital type ( the lattice anisotropy lifts the @xmath15-band degeneracy ) .",
    "the lattice is then gradually changed in order to realize the lz sweep .",
    "the density of the cloud can be measured either via time - of - flight or by florescence measurements , which can work even at the single site level  @xcite .",
    "the idea of an interplay between physical mechanisms characterized by different time - scales means , in our case , that we consider a system of both internal `` spin '' ( the two orbitals ) and external spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "the idea is that if the external degrees of freedom are frozen we recover a regular ( non - linear ) lz problem , while if the full system is considered the evolution of the external degrees of freedom taking place during the lz sweep can affect the onsite lz transition probabilities . as we will see below , the lengths of the onsite spinors are not fixed and my vary in time .",
    "in particular , the lengths give the number of atoms at that site .",
    "the change in the spinor length follows then from the fact that the atoms are mobile and can occupy different sites .",
    "we will demonstrate that this particle mobility renders very complex coupled evolution .",
    "we may note that this situation is qualitatively different from earlier studies of lz lattice physics  @xcite where the occupation in the sites is fixed , and the presence of surrounding sites appears solely as a dephasing effect on the onsite problems .    in the following section",
    "were the results are presented we assume that a mean - field approximation is justified , i.e. the atom number on every single site is typically larger than ten . even at the edge of the atomic cloud , where the particle number drops well below ten , we imagine that number fluctuations are still large and a mean - field description to be motivated . by virtue of the mean - field approach",
    "we make the coherent state ansatz , i.e. @xmath79 where the @xmath44-site state @xmath80 is a two - mode coherent state @xmath81 a fock state with @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath32- and @xmath33-orbital atoms at site @xmath44 respectively . as coherent states we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "note that @xmath80 represents the spinor at site @xmath44 and from here it follows that its norm @xmath86 gives the number of particles at that particular site , i.e. @xmath87 is the total number of particles .",

    "( [ secondham ] ) .",
    "after writing the hamiltonian @xmath89 on a normally ordered form , and using the fact @xmath90 for any @xmath41 and @xmath44 , it directly follows that the energy functional is simply obtained by replacing operators @xmath43 ( @xmath91 ) with @xmath92 ( @xmath93 , where @xmath94 represents complex conjugation ) .",

    "throughout , the interaction is taken to be repulsive , @xmath102 .",
    "the mean - field equations of motion can be derived from the hamilton s equations @xmath103 .",
    "the resulting equations ( i.e. discrete gross - pitaevskii equations ) become  @xcite @xmath104 the above expressions make clear that @xmath92 couples to its own complex conjugate @xmath93 .",
    "this peculiar coupling of the order parameter stems from the orbital changing term @xmath105 given in eqs .",
    "( [ ocint ] ) and ( [ oc ] ) . normally for gross - pitaevskii realizations appearing in atomic physics , the order parameter couples only to its density @xmath106 and not to @xmath107 alone  @xcite .",
    "the coherent state amplitudes @xmath92 should be seen as the superfluid order parameter ; the atoms are assumed condensed and @xmath108 gives the number of atoms of flavor @xmath45 in site @xmath44 .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that the full atomic density , taking the spatial dependences of the wannier functions into account , is @xmath109 nevertheless , in the following we will talk about the atomic density as the occupations of the different orbital states @xmath110 , and the total density at site @xmath111 @xmath112 where as mentioned earlier , @xmath110 gives the number of @xmath40-orbital atoms in site @xmath111 .",
    "the presence of a trap is crucial for the system evolution during the lz sweep . at first , this may seen as strange since the trap shifts the energies of the two orbitals equally within a single site . in another language , it seems to be a local change of an effective chemical potential .",
    "but as we will explain next , this is indeed * not * a local density approximation , which derives from the anisotropic properties of the tunnelling , i.e. @xmath113 .    the tunnelling part of the hamiltonian drives the kinetics of particles within the lattice .",
    "hence , the coefficients @xmath114 and @xmath115 can be seen as inverse effective masses for the particles . since @xmath113 ,",
    "a @xmath32-orbital particle is ` heavier ' in the @xmath8-direction than in the @xmath7-direction , and oppositely for a @xmath33-orbital particle .",
    "thus , an initially localized single @xmath32-orbital particle will diffuse more rapidly in the @xmath7-direction than in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "furthermore , the effective mass is negative in the @xmath7-direction so the particle actually maintain both a ` particle ' and a ` hole ' character .",
    "now , if such a single @xmath32-orbital particle is confined in a harmonic potential ( atomic trap ) , its ground state wave function , @xmath116 , is gaussian in both directions , but its width in the @xmath7-direction is larger than in its @xmath8-direction .",
    "naturally , the opposite holds true for a @xmath33-orbital particle .",
    "interaction will couple the two orbital states , but as long as the interaction is not too strong ( that is , we are not in the thomas - fermi regime  @xcite ) the ground state of @xmath117 particles will not be polar symmetric even if the harmonic potential is isotropic  @xcite .",
    "that means that at sites at the boundary of the particle distribution , either @xmath32- or @xmath33-orbital particle densities will dominate .",
    "this demonstrates that the model goes beyond the local density approximation - the onsite potential strength does not uniquely determine the particle density ( chemical potential ) locally .",
    "how does this intrinsic anisotropy affect the lz driving ?",
    "starting with say @xmath118 all particles will reside in the @xmath32-orbitals and the ground state particle distribution will be elongated in the @xmath7-direction . for @xmath119 ,",
    "on the other hand , the corresponding distribution will instead be elongated in the @xmath8-direction and all particles will populate @xmath33-orbitals .",
    "this observation will be explicitly demonstrated in the next section .",
    "when we drive the lz transition adiabatically it means that at every occupied site particles swap from @xmath32- to @xmath33-orbitals .",
    "simultaneously , if we are to remain in the global ground state the external shape of the particle distribution must also change ( otherwise we pay a price in potential energy ) ; the squeeze - shaped atomic density should be rotated by 90 degrees . at every populated site a non - linear lz transition is realized , but in addition , the sites are coupled and particles can hop between them . the onsite lz transition occurs on some characteristic time @xmath120 that will depend on the sweep velocity @xmath3 and the interaction strength @xmath4 , but also on the tunnelings @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( as explained in the next paragraph ) .",
    "the extrinsic dynamics during the lz transition is characterized by some time @xmath121 which depends predominantly on the tunnelling amplitudes .",
    "of course , this is a very simplified picture of the full coupled system , but it gives an idea of the complex dynamics .",
    "it follows that performing an adiabatic sweep would mean that @xmath122 .",
    "physically , if we have a macroscopic number of particles in our lattice the above scenario implies that we need to achieve a macroscopic current of particles within the lattice . for",
    "physically relevant parameters one would therefore expect that @xmath123 . then , if @xmath124 the onsite lz transitions can be adiabatic while the overall particle distribution becomes excited in terms of collective vibrations .    a qualitative argument to explain the difference in time - scales , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , goes as follows .",
    "we first note that the single site problem can be mapped onto a lipkin - meshkov - glick lz problem  @xcite . due to the non - linearity appearing in the mean - field model ,",
    "so called swallow - tail loops of the adiabatic energies form  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the present lipkin - meshkov - glick system these loops are always present and they makes the gap between the lowest adiabatic energies to vanish .",
    "this would suggest that the intra time - scale @xmath120 should go to infinity .",
    "however , the present lattice model can not be understood from single site evolution , and the fact that the sites are couple implies that an effective gap opens up between the lowest onsite adiabatic energies .",
    "this gap is of the order of the tunnelings @xmath125 . in particular , the gap size does not depend , to lowest order , on the system size since the number of neighbors is fixed .",
    "on the other hand , the inter time - scale @xmath121 will depend on the total number of sites ( the single particle tight - binding model is gapless ) , and in particular this gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , for sufficiently large lattices the slow time - scale will unambiguously be the inter site one .",
    "in this section the idea is to demonstrate numerically what we previously argued , namely that the coupling between internal and external evolution leads to very complex full system dynamics where in particular the franck - condon type physics alters the lz transition .    the many - site problem of eq .",
    "( [ mfeom ] ) is solved using the split - operator method  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to both consider time - dependent problems as well as extracting the ground state by simply propagating some initial state in imaginary time , @xmath126 . for simplicity",

    "an alternative approach would be to add a stochastic noise term to the equations of motion ( [ mfeom ] ) , but this implies that we need to perform sample averaging and a considerable slow down in the computations .",
    "thus , we omit such an approach and it is also believed that the qualitative results would not change from the ones presented below .    to understand the non - adiabatic excitations we will introduce the widths of the @xmath33-distribution @xmath154 where @xmath155 ( @xmath41 ) is the discrete position operator . from the above widths we define the squeezing measure @xmath156 which tells how elongated the @xmath33-distribution is ; @xmath157 no squeezing , @xmath158 squeezing in the @xmath8-direction , and @xmath159 squeezing in the @xmath7-direction . if the lz sweep is adiabatic we have that at the final time @xmath160 @xmath161 and moreover @xmath162 should be time - independent for large times .",
    "variations in @xmath162 derive mainly from non - adiabatic excitations in terms of vibrations in the particle distribution ( phonons ) , and we thereby introduce @xmath163 as the time - variance of the squeezing parameter at time @xmath164 . in the following , @xmath165 and @xmath163 will be our rough measures of intra- and inter - well non - adiabatic corrections respectively .",
    "but it should be kept in mind that there is not a one - to - one relation between these quantities and the lz induced excitations .",

    "[ fig8 ] we present numerical results from integrating eq .",
    "( [ mfeom ] ) for various sweep velocities @xmath3 .",
    "the integration interval @xmath169 $ ] is taken long enough such that the effective diabatic states @xmath170 and @xmath171 are approximately decoupled at @xmath172 and @xmath160 .",
    "the initial state is obtained from first finding the ground state ( which will almost entirely populate the @xmath32-orbitals ) for the given @xmath173 .",
    "we then populate the @xmath33-orbitals with one percent by altering the initial state artificially where we take the @xmath33-orbital distribution @xmath174 to be the same as the one for the @xmath32-orbitals , @xmath175 . by increasing the initial population in the @xmath33-orbitals the intrinsic evolution would in general",
    "be more adiabatic since the gap scales with @xmath176 .",
    "however , this would also imply that the system would initially be more excited . in the figure we vary @xmath3 while the remaining parameters are calculated from wannier function overlap integrals , eqs .",
    "( [ tunov ] ) and ( [ intov ] ) , corresponding to an optical lattice with an amplitude of 17 recoil energies .",
    "this particular choice is meant to represent an experimentally relevant situation .",
    "the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows @xmath177 as a function of @xmath3 , and the lower plot gives @xmath178 at the same instant .",
    "due to long computational times , only a few values of @xmath3 have been considered .",
    "the solid line is a fit of a fifth order polynomial to the calculated data .",
    "an interesting question is whether @xmath179 can be assigned an exponential or a power - law dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "characteristic for the standard lz problem is its exponential dependence on the coupling strength @xmath4 and the sweep velocity @xmath3  the transition probability is a smooth and monotonous function of both @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , from the form of @xmath180 ( given in the introduction ) it follows that the result for small @xmath3 ( i.e. for adiabatic evolution ) is non - perturbative .",
    "extensions to multi - level problems  @xcite , many - body situations  @xcite , and non - linear lz transitions  @xcite have been considered . when the lz model becomes non - linear both the exponential dependence and the smoothness of @xmath180",
    "may be lost  @xcite .",
    "such non - linear lz problems typically arise in mean - field theories for single site lz problems .",
    "it is particularly found that for strong enough non - linearity , adiabaticity can not be achieved regardless of how slow the lz sweep is  @xcite .",
    "in addition , instead of an exponential dependence in the adiabatic regime the transition probability was found to obey a power - law dependence , i.e. @xmath181 for some power @xmath182  @xcite .",
    "power - law dependences have also been predicted in many - body lz problems beyond the mean - field regime  @xcite .",
    "the large fluctuations and the few data points of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] make it impossible to extract any reliable power - law dependence of @xmath177 in the adiabatic regime .",
    "it is found , however , that @xmath177 shows a weak @xmath3-dependence for @xmath183 , and then rapidly approach unity .",
    "this weak @xmath3-dependence for small sweep velocities followed by a `` rapid '' change in the transition probability directly imply that trying to fit a curve @xmath184 suggested by the lz formula , for some fitting parameter @xmath185 , would give a large discrepancy .",
    "for example , @xmath186 displays a rapid increase for small @xmath3 s and then a slow saturation to its asymptotic value .",
    "thus , it is clear that the transitions of the present model greatly differ from those of a single linear lz problem .     of the two orbitals in a situations where non - adiabatic excitations occurs mainly in the external degrees of freedom ( @xmath187 ) , i.e. in phononic vibrations of the particle distribution .",
    "the distribution is still squeezed in the @xmath8-direction despite the fact that almost only the @xmath33-orbital states are populated which clearly indicates that the transition takes place in the franck - condon regime . the sweep velocity @xmath188 and the rest of the parameters are as in fig .",
    ", width=264 ]    as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ( b ) , the fluctuations in the squeezing measure reach a peak in the regime when intra - site excitations are still relatively low .",
    "thus , as discussed earlier , the internal time - scale @xmath120 is shorter than the external one @xmath121 , and non - adiabatic excitations predominantly occur as vibrational phonon modes of the particle distribution .",
    "upon increasing @xmath3 , the fluctuations of @xmath189 decrease and here it is actually found that the distribution has not performed any ` rotation ' , i.e. the lz sweep has mainly taken place onsite , or in other words this is deep in the franck - condon regime . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we give an example ( snapshot ) of the final full distribution @xmath190 . here",
    "@xmath187 implies good intra - site lz transfer , but from the plot it is clear that external excitations in terms of particle vibrations are large .",
    "such large quantum fluctuations are indeed common for many - body lz problems  @xcite .",
    "the difference in this study compared to earlier ones is that we can characterize the excitations into two categories of internal and external , and thereby also quantify the types of excitations .",
    "the external excitations can be analyzed in terms of the fourier spectrum of some physical quantity @xmath191 .",
    "here we define the ` spectrum ' as the fourier transform of the @xmath7- and @xmath8-`widths ' of the full distribution @xmath192 , @xmath193 here , @xmath160 is the time when the lz sweep stops and after that the system is evolving with a constant detuning @xmath194 .",
    "thus , @xmath195 is not exploring the evolution through the lz transition , but only the vibrations in the full distribution caused be the lz sweep .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for both the directions .",
    "there are some common vibrational mode frequencies for both directions , @xmath196 .",
    "the @xmath8-component also have two additional clear modes at @xmath197 .",
    "these excitation frequencies are of the same order as the tunnelings @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) and @xmath115 ( @xmath200 ) as well as the trap frequency @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "since @xmath198 determines the band width excitations occur within the band .",
    "in particular , the amplitude of the vibrational modes is much smaller than the typical energy gap to other bands . for a potential amplitude @xmath203 ( in scaled units )",
    ", we have the gap @xmath204 .",
    "thus , the characteristic energies of these phonon modes are at least two orders of magnitude smaller than excitations between bands within the lattice and as a result we conclude that the single - band approximation should be valid .     for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 vibrations of the full atomic distribution @xmath192 .",
    "the fourier transform is taken in the interval preceding the lz transition .",
    "the parameters are as in fig .",
    ", width=302 ]    let us end by a remark on how this model shows similarities to situations in molecular physics and in this sense can serve as a controllable model for studies of phenomena known from this field .",
    "the present lz process is a kind of realization of franck - condon physics  @xcite .",
    "the idea of the franck - condon mechanism is schematically described in fig .",
    "the franck - condon principle plays an important role in molecular physics where the transition takes place between electronic states .",
    "it is used to understand internal molecular dynamics in pump - probe experiments . here , the transition is between the orbital states , which belong to different bloch bands , and the vibrational motion of the molecule is here replaced by particle motion within the lattice .",
    "one can imagine that by increasing the tunneling rates @xmath114 and @xmath115 it could be possible to be in a regime were @xmath205 and the franck - condon principle would not hold any longer",
    ". such a situation might be difficult to achieve experimentally since in this regime the single - band and tight - binding approximations fail . however , there are probably ways to circumvent such issues , for example by considering non - separable lattices where the single - band approximation is much more easily fulfilled  @xcite .",
    "the tight - binding approximation is , in principle , not expected to be too crucial for the present analysis and consequently it is possible that the present system can work as a testbed for studies of franck - condon physics and its breakdown in a controlled manner .",
    "moreover , here we analyze lz transitions , but one could consider other schemes more similar to pump - probe methods , like raman transitions  @xcite or lattices shaking  @xcite .",
    "( schematically represented by a @xmath32-orbital in the plot ) and a coupling @xmath206 between the @xmath32- and @xmath33-orbitals is turned on . if the coupling realizes a @xmath207-pulse transition , the particle will reside solely on the upper @xmath33-orbital branch after the turn - off of the coupling . in the franck - condon regime",
    "the state will be approximately @xmath208 ( a @xmath33-orbital state at site @xmath209 ) , i.e. the effective coupling strengths @xmath210 and the pulse is short such that tunnelings are negligible during the transfer .",
    "it is clear that for a pulse with a long duration the external evolution will affect the final state on the @xmath33-orbital branch.,width=264 ]",
    "in this work we considered a lz lattice problem at the mean - field level . while the present model could be experimentally realized in various types of systems , here we focused on one of cold bosonic atoms loaded into the @xmath15-bands of optical lattices . the novel feature of this system ,",
    "appearing naturally on the @xmath15-band , derived from an interplay between intra - site lz transitions and inter - site particle dynamics .",
    "the ability of particles to tunnel between lattice sites resulted in a much stricter constrain for adiabaticity .",
    "more precisely , an adiabatic evolution implied a macroscopic particle flow within the lattice .",
    "the non - adiabatic excitations appear as phonons making the particle distribution non - stationary . for physically relevant parameters",
    "it was found that the intra - site time - scale was much shorter than the inter - site time - scale which resulted in a franck - condon scenario . in this cold - atom system ,",
    "time - of - flight or single site addressing measurements would provide direct insight into both internal and external excitations created during the lz sweep .",
    "all results of this work assume a relatively large particle number per site ( typically @xmath211 ) where mean - field approximations start to give an accurate description of the physics .",
    "an interesting continuation would be to consider the opposite regime of a low filling and were strong correlations become dominant , e.g. in the insulating phase . as recently pointed out  @xcite ,",
    "the physics of this system in the mott insulator with unit filling is extremely rich and in particular realizes a @xmath212 heisenberg model , where the lz sweep would represent a gradual change in the external field .",
