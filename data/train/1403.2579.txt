    "quantum communication has opened up the possibility to transmit quantum information over long distance . a quantum repeater protocol proposed by briegel _",
    "@xcite fulfills such a long distance system .",
    "subsequently , duan , lukin , cirac , and zoller ( dlcz ) @xcite suggested a long distance quantum communication based on atomic ensembles .",
    "this scheme involves raman scattering of an incoming light from the atoms with the emission of a signal photon .  the photon is then correlated with coherent excitation of the atomic ensemble .",
    "the information may be transfered through light to another atomic ensemble or retrieved by a reverse raman scattering process , generating an idler photon directional correlated with the signal one @xcite .",
    "the signal and idler photons in alkali gases are in the near - infrared spectral region , which mismatches the telecommunication bandwidth optical fiber .",
    "therefore , an alternative process that is able to generate telecom wavelength photons correlated with atomic spin excitations @xcite would provide the essential step toward practical long distance quantum communication .",
    "the alkali atomic cascade transition shown in figure [ four ] is able to generate telecom wavelength light , the signal , from the upper transition and a near - infrared field , the idler , from the lower one .",
    "the telecom light can travel through the fiber with minimal loss , while the near - infrared field is suitable for storage and retrieval in an atomic quantum memory element .",
    "their use in a quantum information system requires quantum correlations between stored excitations and the telecom field .",
    "it is interesting to assess the cascade scheme in the dlcz protocol given that it could potentially reduce transmission losses in a quantum telecommunication system .",
    "correlated photon pairs may be generated by parametric down conversion ( pdc ) @xcite .",
    "the degree of entanglement can be quantified by schmidt mode decomposition @xcite , allowing the influence of group - velocity matching @xcite to be assessed .",
    "a pure single photon source is a basis element for quantum computation by linear optics ( loqc ) @xcite , and it can be conditionally generated by measurement @xcite .  a similar approach can be applied to the study of the transverse degrees of freedom in type - ii pdc @xcite and pdc in a distributed microcavity @xcite .  in photonic - crystal fiber ( pcf ) , a factorizable photon pair can be generated by spectral engineering @xcite .",
    "the spectral effect has been discussed in relation to a quantum teleportation protocol @xcite as a first step toward quantum communication .",
    "this motivates the research in this article where we study the spectral effect of correlated photon pair generated from cascade atomic ensemble in dlcz scheme .",
    "the dlcz scheme is based on entanglement generation and swapping , and quantum state transfer , which make up the basic elements for long distance quantum communication .",
    "generating entanglement is the first step in quantum information processing , and entanglement swapping is the essence to distribute the entanglement over distant places .",
    "quantum state transfer enables the secure transmission to eavesdropping which is therefore of great practical interest @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we start from formulating a two - photon state generated in a cold atomic ensemble .",
    "we use schrdinger s equation to investigate the correlated signal and idler photons spontaneously emitted from two driving lasers via four - level atomic structure .",
    "the essence of phase - matching in the four - wave mixing ( fwm ) conditions is discussed in section 2 , and we calculate the second - order correlation function to show the bunching behavior of the cascade - emitted photons .  in section 3 , we briefly review the schmidt decomposition that is used to analyze the frequency entanglement and mode functions of the two - photon source .",
    "we characterize these spectral properties of the correlated two - photon state for different superradiant decay constants and study how the laser excitation pulse modifies their spectral profile .",
    "we then demonstrate the modified dlcz scheme , a quantum repeater protocol , which employs cascade emission in section 4 .",
    "we reconstruct the elements of dlcz scheme including entanglement generation , entanglement swapping , effective ` polarization ' maximally entangled state projection , and quantum teleportation .",
    "we investigate how frequency entanglement of the cascade photon pair influences these elements , and study their performances ( fidelity , heralding and success probabilities ) for two types of photon detectors ( resolving photon number or not ) along with dependence of quantum efficiency .",
    "we then conclude in section 5 and discuss the alternative method of generating telecom photon by frequency conversion .",
