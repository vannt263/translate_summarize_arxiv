    "media - based modulation ( mbm ) , a promising modulation scheme for wireless communications in multipath fading environments , is attracting recent research attention @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the key features that make mbm different from conventional modulation are : @xmath3 mbm uses digitally controlled parasitic elements external to the transmit antenna that act as radio frequency ( rf ) mirrors to create different channel fade realizations which are used as the channel modulation alphabet , and @xmath4 it uses indexing of these rf mirrors to convey additional information bits .",
    "the basic idea behind mbm can be explained as follows .",
    "placing rf mirrors near a transmit antenna is equivalent to placing scatterers in the propagation environment close to the transmitter .",
    "the radiation characteristics of each of these scatterers ( i.e. , rf mirrors ) can be changed by an on / off control signal applied to it .",
    "an rf mirror reflects back the incident wave originating from the transmit antenna or passes the wave depending on whether it is off or on .",
    "the on / off status of the mirrors is called as the ` mirror activation pattern ( map ) ' .",
    "the positions of the on mirrors and off mirrors change from one map to the other , i.e. , the propagation environment close to the transmitter changes from one map to the other map .",
    "note that in a rich scattering environment , a small perturbation in the propagation environment will be augmented by many random reflections resulting in an independent channel .",
    "the rf mirrors create such perturbations by acting as controlled scatterers , which , in turn , create independent fade realizations for different maps .    if @xmath0 is the number of rf mirrors used , then @xmath5 maps are possible .",
    "if the transmitted signal is received through @xmath1 receive antennas , then the collection of @xmath5 @xmath1-length complex channel gain vectors form the mbm channel alphabet",
    ". this channel alphabet can convey @xmath0 information bits through map indexing .",
    "if the antenna transmits a symbol from a conventional modulation alphabet denoted by @xmath6 , then the spectral efficiency of mbm is @xmath7 bits per channel use ( bpcu ) .",
    "an implementation of a mbm system consisting of 14 rf mirrors placed in a compact cylindrical structure with a dipole transmit antenna element placed at the center of the cylindrical structure has been reported in @xcite .",
    "early reporting of the idea of using parasitic elements for index modulation purposes ( in the name ` aerial modulation ' ) can be found in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "mbm has been shown to possess attractive performance attributes , particularly when the number of receive antennas is large @xcite-@xcite .",
    "specifically , mbm with @xmath0 rf mirrors and @xmath1 receive antennas over a multipath channel has been shown to asymptotically ( as @xmath2 ) achieve the capacity of @xmath1 parallel awgn channels @xcite .",
    "this suggests that mbm can be attractive for use in massive mimo systems which typically employ a large number of receive antennas at the bs .",
    "however , the literature on mbm so far has focused mainly on single - user ( point - to - point ) communication settings .",
    "our first contribution in this paper is that , we report mbm in multiuser massive mimo settings and demonstrate significant performance advantages of mbm compared to conventional modulation . for example , a bit error performance achieved using 500 receive antennas at the bs in a massive mimo system using conventional modulation can be achieved using just 128 antennas with multiuser mbm .",
    "even multiuser spatial modulation ( sm ) and generalized spatial modulation ( gsm ) @xcite-@xcite in the same massive mimo settings require more than 200 antennas to achieve the same bit error performance .",
    "this suggests that multiuser mbm can be an attractive scheme for use in the uplink of massive mimo systems .",
    "the second contribution relates to exploitation of the inherent sparsity in multiuser mbm signal vectors for low - complexity signal detection at the bs receiver .",
    "we resort to compressive sensing ( cs ) based sparse recovery algorithms for this purpose .",
    "several efficient sparse recovery algorithms are known in the literature@xcite-@xcite .",
    "we propose a multiuser mbm signal detection scheme that employs greedy sparse recovery algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp)@xcite , compressive sampling matching pursuit ( cosamp ) @xcite , and subspace pursuit ( sp)@xcite .",
    "simulation results show that the proposed detection scheme using sp achieves very good performance ( e.g. , significantly better performance compared to mmse detection ) at low complexity .",
    "this demonstrates that cs based sparse signal recovery approach is a natural and efficient approach for multiuser mbm signal detection in massive mimo systems .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the multiuser mbm system model is introduced in sec .",
    "the performance of multiuser mbm with maximum likelihood detection is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . the proposed sparsity - exploiting detection scheme for multiuser mbm signal detection and its performance in massive mimo systems",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "consider a massive mimo system with @xmath8 uplink users and a bs with @xmath1 receive antennas ( see fig .",
    "[ mbm_mimo ] ) , where @xmath8 is in the tens ( e.g. , @xmath9 ) and @xmath1 is in the hundreds ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the users employ mbm for signal transmission .",
    "each user has a single transmit antenna and @xmath0 rf mirrors placed near it . in a given channel use , each user selects one of the @xmath5 mirror activation patterns ( maps ) using @xmath0 information bits .",
    "a mapping is done between the combinations of @xmath0 information bits and the maps .",
    "an example mapping between information bits and maps is shown in table [ table1 ] for @xmath11 .",
    "the mapping between the possible maps and information bits is made known a priori to both transmitter and receiver for encoding and decoding purposes , respectively .",
    ".mapping between information bits and maps for @xmath11 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     apart from the bits conveyed through the choice of a map in a given channel use as described above , a symbol from a modulation alphabet @xmath12 ( e.g. , qam , psk ) transmitted by the antenna conveys an additional @xmath13 bits .",
    "therefore , the spectral efficiency of a @xmath8-user mbm system is given by @xmath14 for example , a multiuser mbm system with @xmath15 , @xmath11 , and 4-qam has a system spectral efficiency of 16 bpcu .",
    "an important point to note here is that the spectral efficiency per user increases linearly with the number of rf mirrors used at each user . to introduce the multiuser mbm signal set and the corresponding received signal vector at the bs ,",
    "let us first formally introduce the single - user mbm signal set .",
    "the mbm channel alphabet of a single user is the set of all channel gain vectors corresponding to the various maps of that user .",
    "let us define @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the number of possible maps corresponding to @xmath0 rf mirrors .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the @xmath19 channel gain vector corresponding to the @xmath20th map of the @xmath21th user , where @xmath22^t$ ] , @xmath23 is the channel gain corresponding to the @xmath20th map of the @xmath21th user to the @xmath24th receive antenna , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , and the @xmath23s are assumed to be i.i.d . and distributed as @xmath28 .",
    "the mbm channel alphabet for the @xmath21th user , denoted by @xmath29 , is then the collection of these channel gain vectors , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "the mbm channel alphabet of each user is estimated at the bs receiver through pilot transmission before data transmission .",
    "the number of pilot channel uses needed for the estimation of each user s channel alphabet grows exponentially in @xmath0 .",
    "it is also noted that , while the mbm channel alphabet of each user needs to be known at the bs receiver for detection purposes , the users transmitters need not know their channel alphabets .      define @xmath31 .",
    "the single - user mbm signal set , denoted by @xmath32 , is the set of @xmath33-sized mbm signal vectors given by @xmath34^t , s_q \\in \\mathbb{a } ,   \\label{ss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the index of the map .",
    "that is , an mbm signal vector @xmath35 in ( [ ss ] ) means a complex symbol @xmath36 being transmitted on a channel with an associated channel gain vector @xmath37 , where @xmath37 is the @xmath38 channel gain vector corresponding to the @xmath20th map .",
    "therefore , the @xmath38 received signal vector corresponding to a transmitted mbm signal vector @xmath35 can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the awgn noise vector with @xmath41 .",
    "the size of the single - user mbm signal set is @xmath42 .",
    "for example , if @xmath11 and @xmath43 ( i.e. , bpsk ) , then @xmath44 , and the corresponding mbm signal set is given by    @xmath45      with the above definitions of single - user mbm channel alphabet and signal set , the multiuser mbm signal set with @xmath8 users is given by @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the transmit mbm signal vector from the @xmath21th user .",
    "let @xmath48^t \\in   \\mathbb{s}_{{\\tiny \\mbox{mu - mbm}}}$ ] denote the vector comprising of the transmit mbm signal vectors from all the @xmath8 users .",
    "let @xmath49 denote the channel gain matrix given by @xmath50 $ ] , where @xmath51 \\in \\mathbb{c}^{n_r \\times m}$ ] , and @xmath18 is the channel gain vector of the @xmath21th user corresponding to @xmath20th map as defined before .",
    "the @xmath38 multiuser received signal vector at the bs is then given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the @xmath38 awgn noise vector with @xmath54 .",
    "in this section , we analyze the ber performance of multiuser mbm under maximum likelihood ( ml ) detection .",
    "we obtain an upper bound on the ber which is tight at moderate to high snrs .",
    "we also present a comparison between the ber performance of multiuser mbm and those of other multiuser schemes that employ conventional modulation , spatial modulation , and generalized spatial modulation .",
    "the ml detection rule for the multiuser mbm system model in ( [ sys ] ) is given by @xmath55 which can be written as @xmath56 the pairwise error probability ( pep ) that the receiver decides in favor of the signal vector @xmath57 when @xmath58 was transmitted , given the channel matrix @xmath59 can be written as @xmath60 defining @xmath61 , we observe that @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath63 where @xmath64 . the conditional pep expression in can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are @xmath68th entries of @xmath58 and @xmath57 , respectively , and @xmath69 is the @xmath68th column of @xmath59 .",
    "the argument of @xmath70 in has the central @xmath71-distribution with @xmath72 degrees of freedom .",
    "the computation of the unconditional peps requires the expectation of @xmath70 with respect to @xmath59 , which can be obtained as follows@xcite : @xmath73 \\nonumber \\\\ & = f(\\alpha)^{n_r } \\sum_{i=0}^{n_r-1 }   \\binom{n_r-1+i}{i } ( 1-f(\\alpha))^i ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "now , an upper bound on the bit error probability using union bound can be obtained as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the hamming distance between the bit mappings corresponding to @xmath58 and @xmath57 .",
    "we evaluated the ber performance of multiuser mbm ( mu - mbm ) using the ber upper bound derived above as well as simulations .",
    "for the purpose of initial comparisons with other systems , we consider a mu - mbm system with @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , bpsk , and 4 bpcu per user .",
    "let @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote the number transmit antennas and transmit rf chains , respectively , at each user .",
    "note that in the considered mu - mbm system , each user uses one transmit antenna and one transmit rf chain , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "we compare the performance of the above mu - mbm system with those of three other multiuser systems which use @xmath3 conventional modulation ( cm ) , @xmath4 spatial modulation ( sm ) , and @xmath85 generalized spatial modulation ( gsm ) .",
    "the multiuser system with conventional modulation ( mu - cm ) uses @xmath84 at each user and employs 16-qam to achieve the same spectral efficiency of 4 bpcu per user .",
    "the multiuser system with sm ( mu - sm ) uses @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and 8-qam , achieving a spectral efficiency of @xmath88 bpcu per user .",
    "the multiuser system with gsm ( mu - gsm ) uses @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and bpsk , achieving a spectral efficiency of @xmath91 bpcu per user .",
    "figure [ ml ] shows the ber performance of the mu - mbm , mu - cm , mu - sm , and mu - gsm systems described above .",
    "first , it can be observed that the analytical upper bound is very tight at moderate to high snrs .",
    "next , in terms of performance comparison between the considered systems , the following inferences can be drawn from fig .",
    "[ ml ] .    *",
    "the mu - mbm system achieves the best performance among all the four systems considered .",
    "for example , mu - mbm performs better by about 5 db , 4 db , 2.5 db compared to mu - cm , mu - sm , and mu - gsm systems , respectively , at a ber of @xmath92 . *",
    "the better performance of mu - mbm can be attributed to more bits being conveyed through mirror indexing , which allows mu - mbm to use lower - order modulation alphabets ( bpsk ) compared to other systems which may need higher - order alphabets ( 8-qam , 16-qam ) to achieve the same spectral efficiency . * mu - mbm performs better than mu - gsm though both use bpsk in this example .",
    "this can be attributed to the good distance properties of the mbm signal set @xcite .    , @xmath80 , 4 bpcu per user , and ml detection .",
    "analysis and simulations.,width=340,height=236 ]    note that though the results in fig .",
    "[ ml ] illustrate the performance superiority of mu - mbm over mu - cm , mu - sm , and mu - gsm , they are presented only for a small system with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this is because ml detection is prohibitively complex for systems with large @xmath8 and @xmath1 ( ml detection is exponentially complex in @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , massive mimo systems are characterized by @xmath8 in the tens and @xmath1 in the hundreds . therefore , low - complexity detection schemes which scale well for such large - scale mu - mbm systems are needed . to address this need , we resort to exploiting the inherent sparse nature of the mbm signal vectors , and devise a compressive sensing based detection algorithm in the following section .",
    "it is evident from the example signal set in that the mbm signal vectors are inherently sparse .",
    "an mbm signal vector has only one non - zero element out of @xmath17 elements , leading to a sparsity factor of @xmath93 .",
    "for example , consider an mbm signal set with @xmath94 and @xmath95 . out of 16 elements in a signal vector ,",
    "only one element is non - zero resulting in a sparsity factor of @xmath96 .",
    "exploitation of this inherent sparsity to devise detection algorithms can lead to efficient signal detection at low complexities .",
    "accordingly , we propose a low - complexity mu - mbm signal detection scheme that employs compressive sensing based sparse reconstruction algorithms like omp , cosamp , and sp .      we first model the mu - mbm signal detection problem as a sparse reconstruction problem and then employ greedy algorithms for signal detection .",
    "sparse reconstruction is concerned with finding an approximate solution to the following problem @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is called the measurement matrix , @xmath99 is the complex input signal vector , @xmath100 is the noisy observation corresponding to the input signal , and @xmath101 is the complex noise vector . the mu - mbm signal detection problem at the bs in ( [ sys ] ) can be modeled as a sparse recovery problem in , with the measurement matrix being the channel matrix @xmath49 , the noisy observation being the received signal vector @xmath102 , and the input being the mu - mbm transmit signal vector @xmath103 .",
    "the noise vector is additive complex gaussian with @xmath104 .",
    "greedy algorithms achieve sparse reconstruction in an iterative manner .",
    "they decompose the problem of sparse recovery into a two step process ; recover the support of the sparse vector first , and then obtain the non - zero values over this support .",
    "for example , omp starts with an initial empty support set , an initial solution @xmath105 , and an initial residue @xmath106 . in each step ,",
    "omp updates one coordinate of the vector @xmath107 based on the correlation values between the residue vector and the columns of the @xmath108 matrix . in the @xmath21th iteration , an element @xmath109 given by @xmath110",
    "is added to the support set , where @xmath111 is the @xmath112th column of @xmath113 , and @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the support set and residue after @xmath116 iterations , respectively .",
    "the entries of @xmath107 corresponding to the obtained support set are computed using least squares .",
    "this process is iterated till the stopping criteria is met .",
    "the stopping criteria can be either a specified error threshold or a specified level of sparsity .    in the sp algorithm , instead of updating one coordinate of @xmath107 at a time as in omp",
    ", @xmath8 coordinates are updated at once .",
    "the major difference between omp and sp is the following . in omp ,",
    "the support set is generated sequentially .",
    "it starts with an empty set and adds one element in every iteration to the existing support set .",
    "an element added to the support set can not be removed until the algorithm terminates .",
    "in contrast , sp provides flexibility of refining the support set in every iteration .",
    "cosamp is similar to sp except that it updates @xmath117 coordinates in each iteration to the support set instead of updating @xmath8 coordinates as in sp .",
    "cosamp and sp have superior reconstruction capability comparable to convex relaxation methods @xcite,@xcite .",

    "an mbm signal vector from a user has exactly one non - zero entry out of @xmath17 entries as observed in the example mbm signal set in .",
    "hence , sr is expected to reconstruct a mu - mbm signal vector such that the mbm signal sub - vector corresponding to a given user has only one non - zero entry . but this constraint on the expected support set is not built in the general sparse recovery algorithms . in general , a sparse recovery algorithm can output @xmath8 non - zero elements at any of the @xmath129 locations of @xmath128 . to overcome this issue",
    ", we define user activity pattern ( uap ) , denoted by @xmath130 , as a @xmath8-length vector with @xmath21th entry as @xmath131 if there is at least one non - zero entry in the @xmath21th user s recovered mbm signal vector , and @xmath132 otherwise .",
    "a valid reconstructed signal vector is one which has all ones in @xmath130 .",
    "sr is used multiple times with a range of sparsity estimates starting from @xmath8 ( @xmath133 in the algorithm listing ) till the valid uap is obtained ( i.e. , till the algorithm reconstructs at least one non - zero entry for each user s mbm signal vector ) .    in the algorithm listing , @xmath134 denotes the uap at the @xmath112th iteration . on recovering an @xmath128 with valid uap",

    "<S> in this paper , we consider _ media - based modulation ( mbm ) _ , an attractive modulation scheme which is getting increased research attention recently , for the uplink of a massive mimo system . </S>",
    "<S> each user is equipped with one transmit antenna with multiple radio frequency ( rf ) mirrors ( parasitic elements ) placed near it . the base station ( bs ) </S>",
    "<S> is equipped with tens to hundreds of receive antennas . </S>",
    "<S> mbm with @xmath0 rf mirrors and @xmath1 receive antennas over a multipath channel has been shown to asymptotically ( as @xmath2 ) achieve the capacity of @xmath1 parallel awgn channels . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that mbm can be attractive for use in massive mimo systems which typically employ a large number of receive antennas at the bs . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the potential performance advantage of multiuser mbm ( mu - mbm ) in a massive mimo setting . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that multiuser mbm ( mu - mbm ) can significantly outperform other modulation schemes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a bit error performance achieved using 500 receive antennas at the bs in a massive mimo system using conventional modulation can be achieved using just 128 antennas using mu - mbm . </S>",
    "<S> even multiuser spatial modulation , and generalized spatial modulation in the same massive mimo settings require more than 200 antennas to achieve the same bit error performance . </S>",
    "<S> also , recognizing that the mu - mbm signal vectors are inherently sparse , we propose an efficient mu - mbm signal detection scheme that uses compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) , compressive sampling matching pursuit ( cosamp ) , and subspace pursuit ( sp ) .     </S>"
