    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : extreme - values - and - nax - stability ] we review some essential multivariate extreme value theory and provide definitions and constructions of max - stable models . in section [ sec : crps - m - estimation ] we establish regularity conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of the crps m - estimator and provide general formulae for calculating its asymptotic covariance matrix . in section [ sec : crps - for - max - stable ] we specialize these calculations to the max - stable setting . in section",

    "if one is interested in extremes , it is natural to consider the asymptotic behavior of the point - wise maxima .",

    "due to the classic results of fisher - tippett and gnedenko , the marginals of @xmath22 are necessarily extreme value distributions ( frchet , reversed weibul or gumbel ) .",

    "the dependence structure of the limit extreme value process @xmath22 rather than its marginals is of utmost interest in practice .",
    "arguably , the type of the marginals is unrelated to the dependence structure of @xmath22 and as it is customarily done , we shall assume that the limit process @xmath22 has been transformed to standard @xmath37-frchet marginals .",
