    "the purpose of this paper is to study the asymptotic behavior of the number of closed trajectories for hyperbolic flows @xmath3 in compact invariant sets .",

    "thus , if @xmath3 is a weak - mixing axiom a flow restricted to a non - trivial basic set , parry and pollicott proved @xcite that @xmath9 this asymptotic generalizes the classical result of margulis @xcite for geodesic flows on manifolds of negative sectional curvature .",
    "there are a lot of works concerning the analysis of the errors terms in ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) for different classes of dynamical systems as well as under different restrictions on the type of primitive closed trajectories considered ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references there ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath3 satisfies an approximative condition related to three primitive periods , pollicott and sharp @xcite showed that there exists @xmath10 such that @xmath11    on the other hand , for geodesic flows on negatively curved surfaces pollicott and sharp @xcite proved a much sharper asymptotic : @xmath12 where @xmath13 this results is based on estimates of the dynamical zeta function derived from strong spectral estimates for the iterations of the ruelle transfer operator @xcite .",

    "this question is closely related to the asymptotic behavior of sums of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) are functions with exponentially small support as @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the so called roof function related to a given symbolic coding of the flow , @xmath21 is the shift in the corresponding symbol space , and @xmath22 .",

    "the estimate ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) is based on the analytic continuation of the dynamical zeta function @xmath35 for @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the abscissa of absolute convergence of @xmath35 , and this continuation is obtained exploiting again the estimates ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) .",
    "the second problem we deal with concerns the asymptotic of the number of primitive closed orbits . to obtain such",
    "an asymptotic is more difficult than estimating the number of periodic points of shifts maps in abstract symbol spaces .",
    "clearly in this case one has to estimate rather carefully the number of iterated periodic orbits involved in ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) .",
    "strong spectral estimates of the form ( 1.5 ) are known to hold for hyperbolic flows on basic sets under certain additional regularity assumptions concerning the stable and unstable laminations over the basic set and under a local nonintegrability condition ( lnic ) ( see sect .",
    "the latter appears to be a rather weak condition and is expected to be satisfied in most ( if not all ) interesting cases .",
    "indeed , it is already known that this condition is satisfied for contact anosov flows ( @xcite ) , and for open billiard flows in @xmath38 satisfying a certain additional regularity assumption ( @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we show that ( lnic ) always holds for arbitrary basic sets of geodesic flows on hyperbolic manifols of constant negative curvature ( see lemma 3 in sect .",
    "7 which has an independent interest since it implies ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) ) . in the latter case the stable / unstable laminations are smooth , so no extra regularity assumptions are necessary and the estimates ( 1.5 ) always hold .    to describe our results precisely we need to introduce some notation and definitions .",
