    "properties of galaxies seen in the local universe strongly depend on their surrounding environments , as is well known from the morphology  density relation .",
    "early - type galaxies are frequently observed in high - density regions such as clusters and late - type galaxies are common in low - density regions @xcite .",
    "the atlas@xmath10 survey further demonstrates that early - type galaxies are divided into two kinds of populations based on the kinematics : fast rotators and slow rotators @xcite .",
    "this categorization makes the trend in the morphology  density relation more prominent . whereas fast rotators , which form the majority of early - type galaxies , appear in a wide range of environments , slow rotators reside exclusively in dense cores of mature clusters @xcite .",
    "such spatial segregation and the difference in their kinematics could be related to formation processes and subsequent quenching mechanisms of star formation , which probably take place at high redshift . in theoretical models , gas - rich major mergers leading to a spin - down of remnants successfully produce simulated slow rotators and are considered to be one of the possible formation processes of slow rotators @xcite .",
    "given high number densities of star - forming galaxies in proto - clusters at @xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we naturally expect a high frequency of major - merger events .",
    "what is important here is whether they are interactions between gas - dominated systems .",
    "while stellar components within galaxies are collisionless , systems comprising gas are dissipational . therefore , gas - rich major mergers trigger an intense , dusty star formation due to shocks and an inflow of gas that has lost its angular momentum , as well as establishment of the outer profile through violent relaxation @xcite .",
    "co observations are critical for measuring the molecular gas mass within galaxies , @xmath12 , and investigating the star - formation mode characterized by the star - formation efficiency , sfe = sfr/@xmath12 , and the gas depletion timescale , @xmath13/sfr",
    ". co studies at high - redshift have rapidly developed over the past years not only for very bright galaxies in the dust emission such as submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; @xcite ) but for optical / near - infrared selected galaxies such as @xmath14 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , most of them observe high - excitation co lines mainly using the plateau de bure interferometer .",
    "this significantly affects the estimates of molecular gas mass because high-@xmath0 lines trace dense gas regions rather than total gas reservoirs probed by co @xmath15 emission .    in a cluster field at @xmath16 ,",
    "@xcite detect the co @xmath15 line from five dusty star - forming galaxies and find the environmental dependence of sfe is not seen .",
    "@xcite also find that the sfes of two galaxies in a proto - cluster at @xmath17 are comparable to that of field galaxies at similar redshift . on the other hand , @xcite discover four co luminous galaxies across an @xmath3100 kpc region at @xmath18 and find that two of them have a high sfe .",
    "no conclusive result could be obtained due to a small sample size . in this paper , we report results from a deep co @xmath15 observation of a proto - cluster at @xmath19 to search for gas - rich galaxies and see if there is any environmental effect of the star - formation mode in the formation phase of the progenitors of cluster early - type galaxies seen today .",

    "our target is a proto - cluster at @xmath19 , uss1558 - 003 , where an over - density of massive , red - sequence galaxies has been discovered around a radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "this region has also been observed as part of a systematic h@xmath2  narrow - band imaging campaign with moircs on subaru telescope called `` @xmath25 '' project ( mapping halpha and lines of oxygen with subaru ; @xcite ) , and it is found to host numerous h@xmath2  emitters ( haes ; @xcite )",
    ". membership of about half of the 68 haes has been spectroscopically confirmed with a success rate of 70% @xcite .",
    "an extremely dense clump lies about three arc - minutes away from a radio galaxy in the southwest ( figure [ fig;distribution ] ) .",
    "because the dynamical mass of this clump is estimated to be @xmath26 from the h@xmath2  spectroscopy , it is expected to evolve into a single massive system with @xmath27 similar to the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "therefore , this proto - cluster is very likely the site where slow rotators , which will eventually dominate a rich cluster by the present - day , are just in their formation phase .",

    "the non - binning spectra with 2 mhz resolution shows a double - peak profile .",
    "this irregular feature is closely related to a spatial distribution of molecular gas within galaxies .",
    "local edge - on disks show a double - horn profile but a gap at zero - velocity is widespread in the velocity range and moreover rarely below 50% of the peak flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "actually , morphologies of star - forming galaxies become clumpy at @xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if most of the co emission is dominated by a few giant clumps , the observed feature can be readily explained .",
    "otherwise , one double profile would reflect a merger between two galaxies with different velocities .",
    "even higher - resolution observations would make it challenging to discriminate between a merger and multiple kpc - scale clumps within a single galaxy .",
    "we discuss further the physical process in terms of star - formation mode in section [ sec;discussion ] .",
    "although h@xmath2  emission line is one of the best indicators of sfr , it can still miss much of star formation in the case of very dusty galaxies @xcite .",
    "infrared emission , which is a re - radiation of uv flux of massive stars by their surrounding dust , is very useful for estimating dust - obscured sfrs of galaxies .",
    "three mips 24 @xmath6 m sources are identified within the primary beam , and the brightest one with @xmath46jy is located between i d 191 and i d 193 ( figure [ fig;co_map ] ) . since the psf size of the mips images is too large ( @xmath47 ) , we can not measure the 24 @xmath6 m flux density of each galaxy .",
    "we use a radio continuum image to deblend the ir emission , because it is a good indicator of extinction - free sfr reflecting the non - thermal emission from supernovae remnants and free - free emission from ionized gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a 33 ghz ( 116 ghz in the rest frame ) image is created with natural weighting by averaging the data over about 2 ghz excluding the frequency range of the co emission line .",
    "the radio data allow us to speculate the relative contribution of each galaxy to the ir emission .",
    "we estimate a 116 ghz flux density of 4.8 @xmath48jy ( 1.8@xmath49 ) and 10.2 @xmath48jy ( 3.9@xmath49 ) for i d 191 and i d 193 , respectively ( figure 2 ) .",
    "although i d 191 is marginally detected , it is clear that the blended ir emission is dominated by i d 193 .",
    "@xcite demonstrate with @xmath50/pacs data that the conversion from observed 24 @xmath6 m photometries to total ir luminosities , @xmath51 , is applicable with @xmath30.3 dex scatter out to @xmath52 .",
    "using the luminosity - independent conversion factor @xcite , we derive @xmath53 and @xmath5 for i d 191 and i d 193 , respectively . assuming that the bulk of the total ir luminosity is powered by star formation",
    ", we find with the standard calibration of that i d 193 has a high sfr of @xmath54 m@xmath55yr@xmath4 .",
    "since the h@xmath2-based sfr is @xmath340 m@xmath55yr@xmath4 , this object is likely to be strongly attenuated by a large amount of dust ( a@xmath56 mag ) .",
    "on the other hand , i d 213 is not detected at 24 @xmath6 m and the 3@xmath49 upper limit of @xmath57 is given .",
    "the separation of @xmath330 kpc and the velocity offset of @xmath3300 km s@xmath4 between i d 191 and i d 193 suggest that they are probably in the initial stage of a merger . while i d 193 is already red in the rest - frame optical and bright in the ir / radio emission , i d 191 is blue , meaning less dusty or young stellar populations .",
    "such red - blue pairs are also observed in many smgs @xcite . actually , the derived sfr of 886 @xmath58yr@xmath4 in id193 is higher by a factor of about seven with respect to the @xmath59-sfr relation of normal haes ( @xmath60 ; @xcite ) and is similar to that of smgs , where extremely high star formation is thought to be driven by major mergers @xcite .",
    "even the high - redshift disk galaxies fed by cold accretion of gas through cosmic filaments rarely show such extremely high sfrs @xcite .",
    "although this classification based on colors and sfrs is not straightforward , measurements of @xmath7 ratio are helpful for a better understanding of the star - formation mode as it reflects how molecular gas is being turned into stars .    in figure [ fig;coir ] , we plot the two haes with co and ir / radio detections on the @xmath61 diagram to compare them with other populations taken from the literature @xcite .",
    "many previous studies at high redshift are based on the co @xmath62 and @xmath63 line observations , leading to uncertainties in the estimates of the co @xmath15 luminosities because of variations of gas excitation .",
    "therefore , we use only objects whose co @xmath6410 luminosities have been directly measured .",
    "both red and blue hae have a higher ir luminosity compared to normal star - forming galaxies at a fixed co luminosity and are situated close to the regime of low - redshift ulirgs . on the other hand ,",
    "some smgs seem to follow the relation of normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "recent analyses of galaxy morphologies in @xmath65 images show that only 30% of smgs are associated with ongoing mergers @xcite while most of low - redshift ulirgs are likely to be merger - driven starbursts @xcite .",
    "this merger fraction of smgs is highly contentious , with several high - resolution co studies finding it to be 100% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the starburst in i d 191 and id193 is hard to explain by the first encounter or the final coalescence of a merger between them because the separation of 30 kpc is too large to induce violent star formation @xcite .",
    "the red hae with the high sfr , by itself , might be in a late stage of merging where the starburst is induced by a past interaction with another galaxy .",
    "in contrast , the ir luminosity measured in the blue one is highly uncertain because of the low signal - noise ratio of 1.8@xmath49 in the radio emission",
    ". therefore , we do not use i d 191 to characterize the molecular gas properties .",
    "co @xmath15 observations allow us to derive molecular gas masses independent of its excitation level .",
    "the difference of star - formation mode is closely related to a co to h@xmath8+he conversion factor , @xmath66 .",
    "recent measurements of dust mass and dynamical mass demonstrate that @xmath67 ( k km s@xmath4 pc@xmath68 is likely to be appropriate for normal star - forming galaxies at high - redshift @xcite and @xmath69 is for starburst galaxies .",
    "provided that id193 is in the starburst mode , the molecular gas mass and the gas fraction are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "its gas depletion timescale is @xmath72 25 myr which is roughly consistent with that of smgs at similar redshift @xcite . even if using @xmath73 , we find that @xmath74myr is still shorter compared to normal star - forming galaxies ( 400 myr in salpeter imf ; @xcite ) .",

    "would further increase it , such a merger system can be a good candidate of a progenitor of massive quiescent galaxies in local cluster cores .",
    "moreover , i d 193 shows a violent star - formation activity ( sfr=886 @xmath58yr@xmath4 ) , high @xmath7 ratio ( high sfe ) and red optical color . we interpret it as a star - bursting galaxy driven by a gas - rich merger with i d 191 or another galaxy . given the identification of a rare event with the depletion timescale of @xmath78 myr , merger events could frequently occur in the extremely dense environment as surrounding galaxies are expected to be dragged by a gravitational potential of a large halo . by dissipative processes between gas - rich galaxies , the systems that have undergone merger events could be observed as the remnants with little or no rotation ( slow rotators ) at @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis can naturally account for the observational results that slow rotators are frequently observed in local cluster cores @xcite . to confirm whether gas - rich merger events are in fact common in high - density environments at @xmath11 , we need a statistical sample .",
    "the combination of a wide - field h@xmath2  narrow - band imaging with a future wide - field observation of co @xmath15 emission with alma band-1 ( @xmath807 arcmin@xmath81 ) will be powerful for such studies of star - formation modes in proto - clusters at high redshift .",
