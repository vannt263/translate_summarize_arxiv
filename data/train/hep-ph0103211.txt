    "the study of @xmath0 decays plays an important role in understanding the origin of @xmath3 violation and physics of heavy flavor .",
    "we expect that the parameters of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix in the standard model , for instance , the three angles @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the unitary triangle , can be well - determined from @xmath0 decays , especially from the charmless non - leptonic two - body b decays . experimentally , many @xmath0 experiment projects have been running ( cleo , babar , belle etc . ) , or will run in forthcoming years ( btev , cern lhcb , desy herab etc . ) . with the accumulation of the data ,",
    "the theorists will be urged to gain a deeper sight into @xmath0 decays , and to reduce the theoretical errors in determining the ckm parameters from the experimental data .    in the theoretical frame ,",
    "the standard approach to deal with such decays is based on the low - energy effective hamiltonian which is obtained by the wilson operator product expansion method ( ope ) . in this effective hamiltonian",
    ", the short - distance contributions from the scale above @xmath7 have been absorbed into the wilson coefficients with the perturbative theory and renormalization group method .",
    "the wilson coefficients have been evaluated to next - to - leading order .",
    "then the main task in studying non - leptonic two - body @xmath0 decays is to calculate the hadronic matrix elements of the effective operators .",
    "however , we do not have a reliable approach to evaluate them from the first principles of qcd dynamics up to now .",
    "generally , we must resort to the factorization assumption to calculate the hadronic matrix elements for non - leptonic @xmath0 decays , in which the hadronic matrix element of the effective operator ( in general , which is in the form of current - current four - quark operator ) can be approximated as a product of two single current hadronic matrix elements ; then it is parameterized into meson decay constant and meson - meson transition form factor .",
    "the most popular factorization model is the bauer - stech - wirbel ( bsw ) model@xcite . in many cases ,",
    "bsw model achieves great success , which can predict the branching ratios of many modes of non - leptonic @xmath0 decays in correct order of magnitude .",
    "this factorization assumption does hold in the limit that the soft interactions in the initial and final states can be ignored .",
    "it seems that the argument of color - transparency can give reasonable support to the above limit . because @xmath8 quark is heavy , the quarks from @xmath8 quark decay move so fast that a pair of quarks in a small color - singlet object decouple from the soft interactions .",
    "but the shortcomings of this simple model are obvious .",
    "first , the renormalization scheme and scale dependence in the hadronic matrix elements of the effective operators are apparently missed .",
    "then the full decay amplitude predicted by bsw model remains dependent on the renormalization scheme and scale , which are mainly from wilson coefficients . in past years",
    ", many researchers improved the simple factorization scheme and made many remarkable progresses , such as scheme and scale independent effective wilson coefficients@xcite , effective color number which is introduced to compensate the ` non - factorizable ' contributions , etc .",
    "furthermore , some progresses in nonperturbative methods , such as lattice qcd , qcd sum rule etc.@xcite , allow us to compute many non - perturbative parameters in @xmath0 decays , such as the meson decay constants and meson - meson transition form factors .",
    "every improvement allows us to have a closer look at the @xmath0 nonleptonic decays .    except for the factorization approximation ,",
    "another important approach has been applied to study many @xmath0 exclusive hadronic decay channels , such as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 etc .",
    "this is pqcd method@xcite . in this method",
    ", people assumes that @xmath0 exclusive hadronic decay is dominated by hard gluon exchange .",
    "it is analogous to the framework of perturbative factorization for exclusive processes in qcd at large momentum transfer , such as the calculation of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion @xcite .",
    "the decay amplitude for @xmath0 decay can be written as a convolution of a hard - scattering kernel with light - cone wave functions of the participating mesons .",
    "furthermore , in ref.@xcite the sudakov suppression has been taken into account .",
    "two year ago , beneke , buchalla , neubert , and sachrajda ( bbns ) gave a qcd factorization formula in the heavy quark limit for the decays @xmath12@xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the radiative corrections from hard gluon exchange can be calculated by use of the perturbative qcd method if one neglects the power contributions of @xmath13 .",
    "this factorization formula can be justified in case that the ejected meson from the @xmath8 quark decay is a light meson or an onium , no matter whether the other recoiling meson which absorbs the spectator quark in @xmath0 meson is light or heavy .",
    "but for the case that the ejected meson is in an extremely asymmetric configuration , such as d meson , this factorization formula does not hold .",
    "the contributions from the hard scattering with the spectator quark in b meson are also involved in their formula .",
    "this kind of contribution can not be contained in the naive factorization .",
    "but it appears in the order of @xmath1 .",
    "so they said that the naive factorization can be recovered if one neglects the radiative corrections and power @xmath13 suppressed contributions in the qcd factorization , and the ` non - factorizable ' contributions in the naive factorization can be calculated perturbatively , then we do not need a phenomenological parameter @xmath14 to compensate the ` non - factorizable ' effects any more@xcite .",
    "this qcd factorization ( bbns approach ) has been applied to study many @xmath0 meson decay modes , such as @xmath15@xcite , @xmath16 , @xmath11@xcite and other interesting channels@xcite",
    ". some theoretical generalizations of bbns approach have also been made , such as the chirally enhanced power corrections@xcite from the twist-3 light - cone distribution amplitudes of the light pseudoscalar mesons . in this work",
    ", we will take a closer look at this issue .",
    "this work is organized as follows : sect .",
    "ii is devoted to a sketch of the low energy effective hamiltonian ; in sect.iii , we will give a detailed overview of qcd factorization , in which some elaborate calculations are shown , especially for the chirally enhanced power corrections ; sect .",
    "iv is for some detailed discussions and comparison of bbns approach to the generalized factorization and pqcd method ; we conclude in sect.v with a summary .",
    "@xmath0 decays involve three characteristic scales which are strongly ordered : @xmath17 .",
    "how to separate or factorize these three scales is the most essential question in b hadronic decays .    with the operator product expansion method ( ope ) ,",
    "the relevant @xmath18 effective hamiltonian is given by @xcite :    @xmath19+h.c .",
    ",       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20(for @xmath21 transition ) or @xmath22(for @xmath23 transition ) and @xmath24 are the wilson coefficients which have been evaluated to next - to - leading order approximation with the perturbative theory and renormalization group method .    in the eq.(1 ) , the four - quark operators @xmath25 are given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the tree operators , @xmath30 the qcd penguin operators , @xmath31 the electroweak penguin operators , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 the magnetic - penguin operators .    in this effective hamiltonian for @xmath0 decays ,",
    "the contributions from large virtual momenta of the loop corrections from scale @xmath34 to @xmath35 are attributed to the wilson coefficients , and the low energy contributions are fully incorporated into the matrix elements of the operators@xcite .",
    "so the derivation of the effective hamiltonian can be called `` the first step factorization '' .    to evaluate the wilson coefficients",
    ", we must extract them at a large renormalization scale ( for example @xmath36 in the standard model ) by matching the amplitude of the effective hamiltonian ( @xmath37 ) to that of the full theory ( @xmath38 ) , then evolve them by the renormalization group equations from the scale @xmath36 to the scale @xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that the extraction of the wilson coefficients @xmath39 by matching does not depend on the choice of the external states , if we regularize the infrared ( and mass ) singularities properly@xcite .",
    "all dependence on the choice of external states only appears in the matrix elements @xmath40 , and is not contained in @xmath39 .",
    "so @xmath39 only contains the short - distance contributions from the region where the perturbative theory can be applied .",
    "but for the matrix elements @xmath40 , the long - distance contributions appear , and are process - dependent .",
    "several years ago , the perturbative corrections to the wilson coefficients in sm have been evaluated to next - to - leading order with renormalization group method@xcite .",
    "as we know , the wilson coefficients are generally renormalization scheme and scale dependent .",
    "so , in order to cancel such dependence , we must calculate the hadronic matrix elements of the effective operators to the corresponding perturbative order with the same renormalization scheme and at the same scale , then we can obtain a complete decay amplitude which is free from those unphysical dependences .",
    "after `` the first step factorization '' , the decay amplitude for @xmath42 can be written as @xmath43 in which , as mentioned in the previous section , the contributions from the large scale @xmath35 down to @xmath44 has been separated into the wilson coefficients @xmath24 .",
    "the remaining task is to calculate the hadronic matrix elements of the effective operators .",
    "but for the complexity of qcd dynamics , it is difficult to calculate these matrix elements reliably from first principles .",
    "the most popular approximation is factorization hypothesis , in which the matrix element of the current - current operator is approximated to a product of two matrix elements of single current operator : @xmath45 obviously , under this approximation , the original hadronic matrix element @xmath46 misses the dependence of the renormalization scheme and scale which should be used to cancel the corresponding dependence in the wilson coefficients @xmath24 . a plausible solution to recover this scale and scheme dependence of @xmath40 is to calculate the radiative corrections . in one - loop level",
    ", they can be written as @xcite : @xmath47\\cdot \\langle { \\bf q } \\rangle_{\\rm tree } .\\ ] ] here @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent the one loop corrections of qcd and qed respectively .",
    "then one takes @xmath50 therefore , the scheme and scale dependence of @xmath51 which are expressed in the form of @xmath48 and @xmath52 is recovered .",
    "but in quark level , @xmath48 and @xmath52 usually contain infrared divergences if we take the external quarks on - shell@xcite .",
    "to remove or regularize the infrared divergence , the conventional treatment is to assume that external quarks are off - shell by @xmath53 . but",
    "this introduction of the infrared cutoff @xmath53 results in a gauge dependence of one - loop corrections .",
    "so how to factorize the infrared part of the matrix elements is a very subtle question .",
    "but maybe this question would get an important simplification in the case that the final states of b meson decay are two light mesons .",
    "two years ago , beneke , buchalla , neubert and sachrajda proposed a promising qcd factorization method for @xmath54 .",
    "they pointed out that in the heavy quark limit @xmath55 , the hadronic matrix elements for @xmath12 can be written in the form @xmath56.\\ ] ] obviously , the above formula reduces to the naive factorization if we neglect the power corrections in @xmath13 and the radiative corrections in @xmath1 .",
    "they find that the radiative corrections , which are dominated by hard gluon exchange , can be calculated systematically with the perturbative theory in the limit @xmath57 , in terms of the convolution of the hard scattering kernel and the light - cone distribution amplitudes of the mesons .",
    "this is also similar to the framework of perturbative factorization for exclusive processes in qcd at large momentum transfer , such as the calculation of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion @xcite .",
    "then a factorization formula for @xmath12 can be written as @xcite : @xmath58 we call this factorization formalism as qcd factorization or the bbns approach . in the above formula ,",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 are the leading - twist wave functions of @xmath0 and pion mesons respectively , and the @xmath61 denote hard - scattering kernels which are calculable in perturbative theory . at the order of @xmath1 , the hard kernels @xmath62 can be depicted by fig.1 .",
    "figures 1(a)-1(d ) represent vertex corrections , figs 1(e ) and 1(f ) penguin corrections , and figs 1(g ) and 1(h ) hard spectator scattering .    in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "both pions are energetic .",
    "the pion ejected from @xmath8 quark decay moves so fast that it can be described by its leading - twist light - cone distribution amplitude .",
    "the @xmath63 pair in the ejected pion is produced as a small - size color dipole .",
    "consequently , the ejected pion decouples from the soft gluons at leading order of @xmath13 .",
    "of course , only the cancellation of soft gluons is not enough to make the factorization hold , it is necessary that the @xmath63 pair also decouples from the collinear gluons .",
    "both the cancellations of soft gluons and collinear gluons guarantee that the hard kernel @xmath64 is of infrared finiteness .",
    "contrast to the pion ejected from b quark weak decay , the recoiling pion which picks up the spectator in b meson can not be described by its leading - twist light - cone distribution amplitude(lcda ) , because the spectator is transferred to the recoiling pion as a soft quark . here",
    "_ take the point of view that the form factor @xmath65 can not be calculated perturbatively .",
    "if we attempt to calculate the form factor within the perturbative framework , by the naive power counting , we find that the leading twist lcda of pion does not fall fast enough to suppress the singularity at the endpoint where the quark from @xmath8 decay carries almost all momentum of the pion .",
    "it indicates that the contributions to form factor are dominated by the soft gluon exchange@xcite .",
    "this point of view can be justified also from the calculation of the form factor @xmath66 by using light - cone sum rule ( lcsr)@xcite , in which the dominated contribution to @xmath65 comes from the region where the the spectator quark is transferred as a soft quark to the pion .",
    "so the transition form factor survives in the factorization formula as a nonperturbative parameter",
    ". however , when the spectator quark in @xmath0 meson interacts with a hard gluon from the ejected pion , the recoiling pion can be also described by its light - cone distribution amplitude .",
    "this hard spectator scattering is missed in the naive factorization , but calculable in the perturbative qcd at the leading power in @xmath13 .",
    "so with this factorization formula , the remaining hard part of the hadronic matrix element @xmath40 from the scale about @xmath44 has been factorized into the hard scattering kernel , and the long distance contributions are absorbed into the transition form factors and the light - cone wave functions of the participating mesons .",
    "thus this is the `` final factorization '' for the two - body nonleptonic charmless @xmath0 decays .",
    "an explicitly technical demonstration of the above argument has been presented in one - loop level in refs.@xcite . for @xmath67 ,",
    "this qcd factorization has been proved to two - loop order@xcite . in the literature ,",
    "the ejected pion is represented by its leading twist light - cone distribution amplitude(lcda ) . however , since the mass of @xmath8 quark is not asymptotically large , in particular , some power corrections might be enhanced by certain factors , such as the scale of chiral symmetry breaking @xmath68 gev , and have significant effects in studying @xmath0 two - body nonleptonic charmless decays .",
    "so , in this manner , the chirally enhanced power corrections must be taken into account .",
    "accordingly , describing the ejected pion by its leading twist lcda is not enough , the two - particle twist-3 lcdas must be taken into account .",
    "below , we will show the elaborate results of qcd factorization in these two cases . for illustration",
    ", we take @xmath69 as an example , but the result is easily generalized to the cases that the final states are the other light pseudoscalars .",
    "when inserting leading - twist lcda of the light pseudoscalar , in the heavy quark limit , the quark constituents of the ejected pion can be treated as a pair of collinear massless quark and antiquark with the momentum @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively ( @xmath72 is the momentum of the ejected pion and we take @xmath72 as a hard light - cone momentum in calculation , @xmath73 ) , because that the contributions from the transverse momenta of the quarks in ejected pion are power suppressed @xcite .",
    "now we move on to the explicit one - loop calculation of the diagram figs .",
    "1(a)-1(d ) for @xmath74 . for illustration",

    "note that the coordinate @xmath128 in the definition of @xmath127 by the non - local matrix element must be transformed into a partial derivative of a certain momentum in the projection of momentum space .",
    "however , it is difficult to find the derivative which makes the projection only depend on the structure of the light pseudoscalar itself . generally , the momentum which the partial derivative acts on is dependent on the hard kernel .",

    "similarly , the color transparency argument can not only be applied to the strong interactions , but also be generalized to the electromagnetic interactions . when the ejected meson is electric neutral , the soft photons also decouple from the fast moving small electric dipole .",
    "so qed vertex corrections are also of infrared finiteness .",
    "but for the case that the ejected meson is charged , qed corrections are infrared divergent , and the infrared divergence must be cancelled by the soft photon emission mechanism , which is common in the calculation of the radiative corrections for @xmath200 .",
    "about this , it is easy to be covered in the calculation in the previous section , just replacing the qcd vertex by a qed vertex .",
    "this can be called a one - loop demonstration for `` charge '' transparency .",
    "it should be noted that the above arguments must be based on the condition that the ejected meson is in a very compact configuration , then it , as a small color dipole , is disentangled with the soft gluons . otherwise , if its size is too large , it is difficult to decouple from the soft gluons .",
    "for example , the spectator quark in d meson is very soft , and runs around c quark like a soft quark cloud , which has a large overlap with the @xmath0 meson spectator system@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the process in which d meson is ejected from @xmath8 decay is dominated by the soft gluon exchange .      from the expressions of the qcd coefficients",
    "@xmath168 obtained in previous sections , it is found that the renormalization scale dependence of the hadronic matrix elements of the effective operators is recovered .",
    "apparently , we expect this recovered dependence can cancel the scale dependence of the wilson coefficients @xmath39 .    with the renormalization group equations for the wilson coefficients @xmath24 at leading order logarithm approximation@xcite ,    @xmath201    we do find @xmath202 when we neglect the contributions from higher order of @xmath1 . but for @xmath203 or @xmath204 , some scale dependence at the order of @xmath1 still remains .",
    "note that other qcd coefficients ( @xmath205 ) are multiplied by the product of the matrix elements of the conserved currents which are independent of the renormalization scale ; whereas the coefficient @xmath174 or @xmath175 is multiplied by a product of the two matrix elements of scalar and pseudoscalar current @xmath206 which is still of scale dependence .",
    "this scale dependence is generally represented by the factor @xmath207 after we apply the equations of motion to transform the @xmath208 matrix elements into the type of @xmath125 . here",
    "@xmath118 and @xmath119 are the current masses of the valence quarks in meson @xmath209 . with the renormalization group equations for the running mass of the current quark @xmath210 we have @xmath211 consequently",
    ", we find @xmath212 with the asymptotic form of @xmath213 .",
    "then , as we expect , the decay amplitude for @xmath0 decays to two light pseudoscalars predicted by qcd factorization is really independent of the renormalization scale within the constraint @xmath214 .",
    "this also can be obviously seen from the numerical results of @xmath215 listed in table 1 . in particular , if we think that the results of qcd factorization are reliable and really independent of the renormalization scale , maybe @xmath214 is a strict constraint for the form of @xmath133 .",
    "it should be noted that the imaginary part of qcd coefficients @xmath173 only arises at the order of @xmath1 , and depends on the renormalization scale .",
    "this dependence would bring some uncertainties in determining the @xmath3 asymmetries in @xmath0 decays .",
    "maybe this scale dependence of the imaginary part could be cancelled by the results on higher order of @xmath1 .",
    "comparing qcd factorization approach with the generalized factorization@xcite and pqcd method@xcite , some interesting comments are in order .",
    "\\(i ) at the zeroth order of @xmath1 , both of qcd factorization ( bbns approach ) and generalized factorization can reproduce the results of `` naive factorization '' ; at the higher order of @xmath1 , the renormalization scheme and scale dependence for the hadronic matrix elements can be recovered from the hard - scattering kernels @xmath216 in bbns approach and @xmath48 in generalized factorization . however , in generalized factorization , @xmath48 is from the one - loop calculations of quark - level matrix elements .",
    "according to buras _",
    "_ , quark - level matrix elements are accompanied with infrared divergences . to avoid these divergences",
    ", one may assume that external quarks are off - shell .",
    "unfortunately , it will introduce gauge dependence which is also unphysical .",
    "but in the bbns approach , it is different because the external states are all physical and can be approximated as on - shell quarks in the leading order of @xmath13 . as a consequence",
    ", the unphysical gauge dependence does not appear . in the pqcd method , li _",
    "claim that their method is based on a six - quark system in which the external quarks are on - shell , so the gauge invariance of pqcd predictions is guaranteed .",
    "the scale dependence in pqcd prediction is removed by evolving the wilson coefficients down to the proper hard scale .",
    "so no explicit scale dependence is left .",
    "\\(ii ) in generalized factorization and bbns approach , the hadronic transition form factors are not calculable , and they are dominated by soft gluon exchange and determined only by experiments or some non - perturbative approaches such as sum rule , lattice qcd , etc . in particular , the above assumption can be also justified in the bbns approach by naive power counting @xcite .",
    "however , in the pqcd method , this naive power counting rule may be invalid when the transverse momenta of the quark constituents and sudakov suppression are taken into account .",
    "so , li _ et al .",
    "_ thought that the hadronic transition form factors can be calculated in the pqcd method because @xmath8 quark is heavy enough and the soft gluon exchange is suppressed by sudakov form factors .",
    "this is the essential difference between the bbns approach and the pqcd method .",
    "\\(iii ) the generalized factorization considers `` nonfactorizable '' contributions as intractable .",
    "therefore , one may introduce one or more effective color numbers @xmath14 to phenomenologically represent `` nonfactorizable '' contributions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 is assumed to be universal to maintain predictive power . however",
    ", `` nonfactorizable '' contribution is really process - dependent . in the bbns approach and the pqcd method , such `` nonfactorizable '' contributions are indeed calculable in perturbative theory . in consequence",
    ", @xmath14 need not be introduced .",
    "\\(iv ) as mentioned in the above sections , the strong phases predicted by generalized factorization are only from the bss mechanism which is represented by the penguin insertion .",
    "however , the virtuality of the gluon or photon @xmath97 in the penguin insertion is ambiguous in generalized factorization , and usually it is approximated around @xmath98 .",
    "this brings significant uncertainties for predicting the @xmath3 asymmetries for b decays .",
    "a particular interesting result of the bbns approach is that strong phases are not only from the bss mechanism but also from the hard scattering , and there are no uncertainties in determining @xmath97 of penguin insertion .",
    "however , compared with the real part of the decay amplitude , the imaginary part is @xmath217 or power @xmath13 suppressed and can not lead to large @xmath3 asymmetries , since they come solely from hard scattering processes which are only calculable in the heavy quark limit . in the pqcd method , there is no such @xmath1 suppression in the imaginary part of the decay amplitude .",
    "thus @xmath3 asymmetries predicted by the pqcd method are usually greater than the prediction of bbns approach and generalized factorization .",
    "so maybe these differences of prediction for @xmath3 asymmetries can be an experimental test for the bbns and pqcd approaches .",
    "\\(v ) hard spectator contributions [ fig .",
    "1(g)and 1(h ) ] , which are leading power effects in qcd factorization , miss out in `` naive factorization '' and `` generalized factorization '' .",
    "they are , however , @xmath218 suppressed compared with the leading factorized contributions ( the hadronic transition form factors ) .",
    "but , in the pqcd method , they are of the same order as the form factors .",
    "\\(vi ) in the pqcd method , penguin contributions receive a dynamical enhancement called `` fat penguin''@xcite .",
    "but in generalized and qcd factorization , they are missed .",
    "this enhancement in the pqcd method arises from the strong scale dependence of the penguin wilson coefficients @xmath219 , etc .",
    "\\(vii ) final state interactions ( fsi ) do not appear in the three methods .",
    "in qcd factorization , beneke _ et al . _",
    "point out that the cancellation of the infrared divergences implies that the long distance fsi is power suppressed due to the quark - hadron duality . however , this point of view is controversial @xcite , but can be examined by the experimental measurements of @xmath220@xcite .",
    "qcd factorization formula only holds in the heavy quark limit @xmath57 . in the real world @xmath44",
    "is only about @xmath221 gev , the validity of the power suppression may be questionable .",
    "in particular , for several cases , the power suppressed corrections can be numerically large@xcite , because the perturbative expansion is in order of @xmath1 which is not small at the realistic scale @xmath222 compared to @xmath13 .",
    "\\(i ) the hard `` nonfactorizable '' contributions computed by qcd factorization are generally small compared to the leading `` factorizable '' contribution .",
    "but when the leading `` factorizable '' contributions are color suppressed , the `` nonfactorizable '' contribution may be larger than the leading results . at the same time , the potentially soft contribution , which is formally power suppressed , may be important .",
    "for example , in @xmath223 , any perturbative and soft power suppressed contributions can have a significant effect on predicting the branching ratio and @xmath3 asymmetry .",
    "furthermore , this problem also arises when the entire leading power contribution is suppressed by small wilson coefficients , for example , in @xmath224 ; or when the leading power contribution is suppressed by the small ckm elements .",
    "\\(ii ) an important power suppressed contribution is from the higher twist light - cone wave functions of the light mesons .",
    "the chirally enhanced power correction from the two - particle twist-3 wave functions is the most important , and has been partly involved in this work except for the annihilation topologies .",
    "other contribution from multiparticle non - valence fock state has been proved to be also power suppressed@xcite .",
    "however , there is no systematic way to evaluate it .",
    "the author of ref.@xcite proposed a way to evaluate the soft gluon exchange contribution from higher twist @xmath225 wave functions within the frame of the light - cone sum rule(lcsr ) .",
    "but the accuracy of lcsr is limited due to the quark - hadron duality approximation . on the other hand , power correction from transverse",
    "momenta needs a subtle treatment in the future . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors point out that the contribution from the transverse momenta might be considered when we evaluate the hadronic matrix elements to two - loop order . in this case , it is possible that sudakov suppression might be taken into account as well .    in summary , up to now",
    ", we do not have a systematic way to evaluate many kinds of power suppressed corrections for exclusive processes .",
    "how to evaluate such corrections in a consistent way within the frame of qcd factorization is a potentially interesting work .",
    "in this work , we give a detailed discussion for qcd factorization involving the complete chirally enhanced power corrections in the heavy quark limit for @xmath0 decays to two light pseudoscalar mesons , and present some elaborate calculations of radiative corrections at the order of @xmath1 .",
    "we point out that the infrared finiteness of the vertex corrections in the chirally enhanced power corrections requires twist-3 light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) of the light pseudoscalar symmetric .",
    "however , even in the symmetric condition , there is also infrared divergence from the end point of the lcdas in the hard spectator scattering and annihilation topology .",
    "so the transverse momenta and sudakov suppression should be taken into account .",
    "we also point out that the decay amplitude of @xmath2 predicted by qcd factorization is really independent of the renormalization scale , at least at the order of @xmath1 . at last ,",
    "we briefly compare the qcd factorization to the generalized factorization and pqcd method which are generally used in studying @xmath0 exclusive hadronic decays .",
    "we thank professor hai - yang cheng and kwei - chou yang for pointing out errors in the coefficients of @xmath226 and @xmath227 in eqs.(50 ) and ( 52 ) .",
    "and we also thank professor maozhi yang for helpful discussions about qcd factorization and the pqcd method .",
    "this work is supported in part by national science foundation of china and state commission of science and technology of china .",
    "two particle twist-2 and twist-3 light - cone distribution amplitudes of light pseudoscalar mesons are defined by the following nonlocal matrix elements@xcite : @xmath228 with @xmath229 being the decay constant of the light pseudoscalar , @xmath230 ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the masses of the constituent quarks in the pseudoscalar ) , and @xmath231 . here",
