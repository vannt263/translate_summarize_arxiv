    "lightcurves of grbs at gev energies are becoming more numerous @xcite thanks to the observations of the large area telescope aboard the satellite @xcite .",
    "while most of the lightcurves at gev are for long grbs , a fraction of short bursts also have a gev component ( e.g. grb 081024b @xcite and grb 090510 @xcite ) .",
    "the highest energy lat photons associated with grbs have @xmath0 energy in the comoving frame @xcite .",
    "veritas observed the location of 16 detected bursts above @xmath1 and found no associated emission @xcite .",
    "one of the important results of the era @xcite is the discovery of extended emission following some of the short bursts @xcite .",
    "@xcite found extended emission following short grbs in the batse data .",
    "an extended tail of the prompt emission may be one of the tell - tale signs of a merger event @xcite .",
    "the detection of such extended prompt emission in a high fraction of short bursts prompts us to discuss the effects of a continued energy injection into the afterglow external shock , and to discuss its effects on the high energy lightcurves .",
    "the effects of such late - arriving ejecta into the external shocks , whether due to early ejection of a range of lorentz factors or a continued outflow , are especially important for the detectability with future tev range observatories , as it flattens the lightcurves providing a higher flux at late times than in the standard impulsive , single lorentz factor case .",
    "compact binary merger events are the most promising candidates for gravitational wave detection with the ligo and virgo instruments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the working hypothesis for the short grb origin is currently the binary merger scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "electromagnetic counterpart observations are very important for localization of the gravitational wave source @xcite , for additional follow up ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for constraining the physical nature of the gravitational wave signals . furthermore , short bursts by themselves are of significant interest for tev range detections , since their spectra are generally harder then those of long bursts .",
    "previous theoretical analyses typically considered synchrotron or synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission components from top - hat like energy injection episodes when addressing the high energy lightcurves @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the physical processes associated with the refreshed shock and continued ejection scenarios in short grbs , and we calculate the expected lightcurves in different energy bands .",
    "we present illustrative cases , and discuss the observational prospects for gev and tev range observatories already in operation or in preparation .",
    "the basic idea of refreshed shocks is that the central engine ejects material with a distribution of lorentz factors ( lfs ) @xcite .",
    "this happens on a short timescale and it can be considered instantaneous .",
    "the blob with the highest lf starts decelerating first by accumulating interstellar matter . forward and reverse shocks form .",
    "the trailing part of the emitted blobs will catch up with the decelerated material reenergizing the shocks .",
    "this will result in a longer lasting emission by the reverse shock than the usual crossing time ( the latter being valid in the case without these refreshed shocks ) .",
    "the effect of the refreshed shocks is a flattening of the afterglow lightcurve @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is considered a leading candidate for the x - ray plateau ( or shallow decay ) phase @xcite .",
    "we consider the adiabatic evolution of the blast wave @xcite and derive the relation between the lf and radius from energy conservation . at early times",
    "the afterglow may be in the radiative regime @xcite . in this case",
    "the conservation of momentum will yield the correct relation between @xmath2 or @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "it is also possible to fix the extremal lfs and the initial energy ( e.g. from observations ) and consequently the total injected energy can be determined . a reasonable lower limit of injection",

    "this suppression is relevant generally above @xmath48 , but depends significantly on the source redshift . as an example , the lightcurve at @xmath49 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath50 for a source at @xmath51 .",
    "regarding the last point : the pairs created by tev range source photons can upscatter the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons to gev energies @xcite .",
    "this would result in a gev range excess in the spectrum . to account for this component ,",
    "detailed numerical treatment is needed ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which is not the scope of this work . by neglecting this component",
    ", we assume the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) is strong enough to change the direction of the pairs by roughly the beam size of the observing instrument ( e.g. few @xmath52 for fermi around @xmath53 ) .",
    "the deflection angle is @xmath54 where the expression consists of the cooling length of pairs on the cmb photons , the larmor radius of the pairs , the mean free path of tev photons on the ebl , and the source distance in this order . for",
    "a source at @xmath55 the mean free path of a tev photon is of the order of a few @xmath56 mpc , with uncertainties depending on the ebl model . assuming the coherence length of the igmf larger than the cooling length of the pairs , for the magnetic field we get @xmath57 .",
    "on the other hand , such a magnetic field will result in an exceedingly long time delay for the arrival of the gev photons .",
    "any magnetic field value in excess of @xmath58 will give a delay longer than @xmath59 , making the association of the excess gev flux with the grb difficult .",
    "late energy injection in the forward shock can also occur if there is a prolonged central engine activity following the energy injection episode responsible for the prompt emission @xcite . while in the case of short bursts , in a binary neutron star coalescence scenario the disrupted material is accreted on timescales of @xmath60 @xcite , it is possible that the merger results in the formation of a magnetar , which injects energy on a longer scale .",
    "the magnetar injects energy as it spins down , but it can occur also for a black hole central engine",
    ". an initial instantaneous energy injection can also be incorporated , which dominates the initial behavior . at sufficiently late times ( of the order of one to a few times the deceleration time ) , the effect of the continuous injection dominates over the initial injection episode . using the energy conservation and setting an power law injection profile",
    ", we can derive dynamic quantities in a similar fashion to @xcite , @xcite or section [ sec : model ] .",

    "the slope is expected to be @xmath71 ( see @xcite and figure [ fig : lc1 ] ( bottom ) at early times ) .",
    "after @xmath72 , or the order of the deceleration time , the forward shock ssc emission starts to dominate the flux .",
    "the gev range is initially ( while @xmath73 ) below the cooling and characteristic ssc frequencies .",
    "the ssc lightcurve has a break when @xmath74 passes from above and reaches its peak after @xmath75 passes . by this time",
    "this is the dominating component by one order of magnitude .",

    "this feature becomes more prominent with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "there are two possibilities how the ssc could be dominant in the grb afterglows . in the first case ,",
    "the whole gev - range flux is attributed to ssc .",
    "this needs fine tuned parameters as the ssc peak needs to be very early .",
    "the second option is to have a very smooth transition in time between synchrotron dominated and ssc dominated times .",
    "this requires less fine tuning because e.g. the temporal slopes of the two components will not be too different ( see section [ sec : x ] ) but the fluxes have to match within errors .",
    "thus we speculate that a bump feature is present in the lightcurve ( see fig 1 . in @xcite ) , but not significant .",
    "this points to a low value of @xmath12 , close to @xmath136",
    "thus far there is a dearth of short grb afterglow lightcurves observed above @xmath137 energies , compared to long grbs .",
    "nonetheless , future and current observatories offer realistic prospects for detecting gev - tev range emission from these sources , which are also the prime targets for gravitational wave detectors .    we have calculated the tev range radiation for the refreshed shock and the continued injection afterglow models of short grbs .",
    "the refreshed shock model involves a range of injected lfs , the slower material catching up at later times , reenergizing the shocks , and qualitatively similar results are obtained in continuous injection models .",
    "our aim was to show that even though many gev lightcurves decline rapidly , the sensitivity of current and future tev range instruments is sufficient to detect short grb afterglows in the framework of the refreshed shock model , where the decline of the flux can be slower . in the relevant gev - tev range we found that the afterglow ssc components are the main contributors to the flux .",
    "the usual time dependences for the non - injection cases are recovered by setting @xmath93 and @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "we also showed that in the simple case of an ism environment and adiabatic afterglow , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the continuous injection model and the instantaneous injection refreshed shock model with a range of lfs .",
    "a possible distinction between these scenarios can be made by following the x - ray lightcurve . in the continuous injection model",
    "the plateau is expected to end abruptly @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the dependence of the peak time ( peak or plateau in the lightcurve ) on the microphysical parameters and found that it correlates positively with the @xmath138 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 parameters , while it anticorrelates with the external density @xmath101 . for late times and high energies",
    "we have calculated the expected temporal slope .",
    "these can be used , when the first tev range measurements are carried out , to constrain the @xmath12 index of the lf distribution .",
    "the general behavior of a model with a lorentz factor spread or late injection is that for the same total energy output it starts out dimmer and has a flatter decline at later times .",
    "it has a more pronounced plateau phase for higher @xmath12 parameter , ending at @xmath140 .",
    "the importance of the refreshed shock and continuous injection models lie in supplying energy to the external shock complex at late times , flattening the afterglow decay , and thus making it more favorable for detection at tev energies .",
    "the flattening in the lightcurve is most notable at @xmath141 after the burst trigger .",
    "our calculations show that current and next generation ground - based instruments will be well suited to detect the gev - tev emission of short bursts with extended emission . in the event of a gravitational wave trigger ,",
    "even if swift or fermi are in earth occultation , the ground - based gev - tev detections could provide a good counterpart localization .",
    "we thank nasa nnx13ah50 g and otka k077795 for partial support , and david burrows , charles dermer , abe falcone and dmitry zaborov for discussions .",
    "we further thank stefano covino and markus garczarczyk for providing the magic sensitivity curve and the referee for a thorough report ."
