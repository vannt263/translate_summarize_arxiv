    "<S> we calculate the axial form factor in the chiral quark soliton ( semibosonized nambu - jona - lasinio ) model using the semiclassical quantization scheme in the next to leading order in angular velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained axial form factor is in a good absolute ( without additional scaling ) agreement with the experimental data . both the value at the origin and the @xmath0-dependence of the form factor as well as the axial m.s.radius are fairly well reproduced .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1#1 # 1 # 1    = 0.4 cm    rub - tpii-3/95 +   + april,95    recently , including the @xmath1 rotational corrections ( next to leading order ) in the semiclassical quantization scheme , a natural solution for the problem of strong underestimation of the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath2 in the leading order in the semibosonized nambu - jona - lasinio ( chiral quark soliton ) model has been found  @xcite . these corrections lead to an enhancement  @xcite of order @xmath3 for @xmath2 and improve considerably the agreement with the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> apparently one should expect that the @xmath1 corrections will not be small also for the axial form factor and it can change significantly the existing leading order results  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the latter suffer from the fact that @xmath4 is strongly underestimated which does not allow for an absolute agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> it is usually assumed  @xcite that the axial form factor is scaled in the same way like the axial vector coupling constant @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is , however , not necessarily true since the axial form factor contains a second contribution , which does not contribute to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> also in the calculation  @xcite a low constituent mass @xmath5 mev is used , which differs from the value @xmath6 mev extracted from a overall fit  @xcite to the static properties as well as to the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon in the model . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is worth to evaluate the axial form factor in the chiral quark soliton model using the semiclassical quantization scheme with the next to leading @xmath1 rotational corrections included , which is the aim of the present work .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the general decomposition of the matrix element of the axial current @xmath7 in terms of the corresponding form factors : @xmath8\\gamma_5 \\frac{\\tau_a}2 u(p,\\xi)\\ , , \\label{ga - definition}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 stands for spin and isospin . </S>",
    "<S> after some standard manipulations we can express the axial form factor as @xmath11 , \\label{ga - ff}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the nucleon mass and energy @xmath14 , respectively , and @xmath15 is a proton state of spin up . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that eq.([ga - ff ] ) contains matrix elements of the space components of the axial current @xmath16 , and apparently only the first term in eq.([ga - ff ] ) contributes to @xmath2 .    for the evaluation of the matrix element of the axial current we use the simplest su(2)-version of the chiral quark soliton model with up and down quarks , degenerated in mass . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on a semibosonized nambu jona - lasinio lagrangean  @xcite : @xmath17 which includes auxiliary meson fields @xmath18 constrained on the chiral circle . </S>",
    "<S> the model is non - renormalizable and one needs a cutoff to make it finite . </S>",
    "<S> this cutoff @xmath19 and the current quark mass @xmath20 are treated as parameters of the model and are both fixed in the mesonic sector to reproduce the physical pion mass @xmath21 and the pion decay constant @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the third model parameter , the constituent quark mass @xmath23 , can be related to the empirical value of the quark condensate but it still leaves a broad range for @xmath23 . actually , in order to obtain an overall good description of the baryonic properties a value around @xmath24 mev has to be used  @xcite .    in the model </S>",
    "<S> the baryons appear as a bound state of @xmath25 ( number of colors ) valence quarks coupled to the polarized dirac sea . </S>",
    "<S> since the model lacks confinement the proper way to describe the nucleon is to consider  @xcite a correlation function of two @xmath25-quark currents with nucleon quantum numbers at large euclidean time - separation . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the nucleon matrix element of the axial current @xmath26 , is represented by an euclidean functional integral  @xcite with lagrangean ( [ lagrangean ] ) : @xmath27 current @xmath28 is a composite @xmath25 quark operator  @xcite with nucleon quantum numbers @xmath29 : @xmath30    for the evaluation of the path integral in eq.([form - factor - integral ] ) we follow the line of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we will only sketch the derivation . integrating out the quarks in ( [ form - factor - integral ] ) it is easy to see that the result is naturally split in valence and sea parts . </S>",
    "<S> after that we integrate over the meson fields @xmath31 in saddle point approximation  large @xmath25 limit . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to a stationary localized meson configuration ( soliton ) of hedgehog structure @xmath32 which minimizes the effective action @xmath33\\ , , \\label{dirac}\\ ] ] where the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 since the hedgehog soliton field configuration @xmath36 does not preserve the spin and isospin , as a next step we make use of the rotational zero modes to quantize it  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is done assuming a rotating meson hedgehog fields of the form @xmath37 with @xmath38 being a time - dependent rotation su(2 ) matrix in the isospin space . </S>",
    "<S> it means that even in leading order in @xmath25 one has to go beyond the saddle point approximation extending the path integral in eq.([form - factor - integral ] ) over all fields of the form ( [ rothedg ] )  a path integral over @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that for such an ansatz one can transform the effective action @xmath40 in order to separate the angular velocity matrix : @xmath41 the dot stands for the derivative with respect to the euclidean time @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the quark propagator in the background meson field @xmath31 can be rewritten as @xmath43    since the angular velocity is quantized according to the canonical quantization rule , it appears as @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to consider @xmath45 as perturbation and to evaluate any observable as a perturbation series in @xmath45 which is actually an expansion in @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , we make essentially use of the expansions @xmath47 </S>",

    "<S> , the latter corresponds to the hamiltonian of the quantum spherical rotator : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the spin operator of the nucleon and @xmath51 is the total moment of inertia  @xcite , including both the valence and the sea quark contributions . </S>",
    "<S> it means that despite of the fact that in general the path integral over @xmath39 runs over all possible trajectories , in large @xmath25 limit the main contribution comes from trajectories close to those of the quantum rotator with hamiltonian  ( [ h - rot ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h - rot ] ) the quantization rule ( in euclidean space - time ) is given by @xmath52 due to the collective path integral over @xmath39 the order of the not - commuting collective operators @xmath53 is strictly fixed by the time ordering . for given </S>",

    "<S> the other two terms represent the divergent dirac sea part and need regularization . </S>",
    "<S> the regularization functions @xmath64 , @xmath65 can be found in refs.@xcite .    inserting the result ( [ meac ] ) in eq.([ga - ff ] ) , after some straightforward calculations we obtain for the axial factor @xmath66 \\ , , \\label{mtfmga}\\ ] ] where both densities @xmath67 and @xmath68 , split in valence and sea parts , contain leading and next to leading order terms in angular velocity @xmath45 : @xmath69 and @xmath70 the tensors @xmath71 are defined as @xmath72^{(0(1 ) ) } \\ , , \\label{tens00}\\ ] ] and @xmath73^{(1 ) } \\otimes \\tau^{(1)}]^{(0(1 ) ) } \\ , . </S>",

    "<S> similar to @xmath2  @xcite the main contribution to the axial form factor in the leading as well as in the next to leading order in angular velocity comes from the valence quarks and the dirac sea contribution is almost negligible . </S>",
    "<S> table  [ tabl1 ] contains the corresponding values for the dipole mass and m.s.radius as well as for the axial vector coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the other nucleon properties  @xcite a value for constituent mass around 420 mev is preferred . </S>",
    "<S> for this mass value the theoretical curve agrees fairly well with the experimental data without any scaling . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest value of 360 mev is almost excluded . </S>",
    "<S> on fig.[figr1 ] we also show the leading order results . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen the two groups of curves differ in both magnitude and slope . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the extracted dipole masses for the axial form factors , calculated in leading order , are larger . in particular , for @xmath78 mev the dipole mass in the leading order still agrees with the experiment , whereas in the next to leading order it is out of the experimental window . </S>",
    "<S> it means that a simple scaling behavior of the axial form factor as it is assumed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is not valid . on fig.[figr2 ] we present the separated @xmath79- and @xmath80-contributions to the axial form factor . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen the @xmath79 part completely dominates the axial form factor at small momentum transfer .    in table  [ tabl1 ] </S>",
    "<S> we also present our results for the axial m.s.radius calculated from eq.([sqradi ] ) as well as from the dipole fit ( in brackets ) in comparison with the estimate from the experimental dipole fit . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen the values directly calculated from the corresponding densities @xmath79 and @xmath80 are very close to those of the dipole fit which is an indication that even at small @xmath81 the dipole fit is a good approximation to the theoretical curves .    to summarize , we evaluate the axial form factor in the chiral quark soliton model taking into account the next to leading order ( @xmath1 ) rotational corrections in the semiclassical quantization scheme . these corrections provide not only the enhancement , needed to reproduce the experimental value of the axial vector coupling constant , but also change the slope of the axial form factor allowing for an almost perfect absolute ( without additional scaling ) description of the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the axial m.s.radii are also well reproduced . </S>"
