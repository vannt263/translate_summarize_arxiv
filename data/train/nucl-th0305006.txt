    "this paper deals with specific heats of an assembly of interacting nucleons . in recent times",
    "the subject has received a great deal of attention @xcite .",
    "the topic is beset with many controversies .",
    "some of the ideas are : under suitable condtions , nuclear systems exhibit negative heat capacities ; negative heat capacities are obtainable only in the microcanonical ensemble ; negative heat capacities also appear in canonical models but disappear once the drop size crosses the value @xmath2 60 .",
    "we investigate the specific heats using a thermodynamic model .",
    "the basic assumption of the model is that populations of different channels are dictated solely by phase space considerations .",
    "this is a common theme in many applications , for example , smm ( statistical multifragmentation model ) @xcite and mmmc ( microcanonical metropolis monte carlo ) model @xcite although details vary from one model to another .",
    "a canonical model based on this assumption was shown to be easily soluble requiring only very quick and simple computing @xcite . the first application used one kind of particle but was later extended to two kinds of particles @xcite .",
    "this appears to be accurate enough for many applications @xcite and will undoubtedly be used more and more in the future .",
    "we investigate the question of specific heat in this model primarily using one kind of particle .",
    "two kinds of particles were also used but requires longer computing time but we expect no changes from the lessons learnt from the model of one kind of particles .",
    "we will however show also some results obtained from using two kinds of particles .",
    "what we will show is that although @xmath0 for this model is always positive , @xmath1 can sometimes be negative .",
    "this is a finite particle number effect and negative values disappear in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "furthermore we get negative values of @xmath1 in the canonical model itself .",
    "we did not need to go to the microcanonical description .",
    "thermodynamic limit is obtained by using the grand canonical ensemble whereas finite systems are described by canonical model with exact particle number .",
    "we find that negative values of @xmath1 can persist for fairly large systems although this is dependent upon binding energies used etc .. this was not investigated in detail .",
    "the statements made above appear to hold for the lattice gas model as well .",
    "it was demonstrated that @xmath0 is positve in the lattice gas model even for a very small system .",
    "this can be shown almost analytically without having to use a monte - carlo simulation @xcite on the other hand @xmath1 is much harder to calculate in the lattice gas model .",
    "chomaz et al find that @xmath1 can be negative in the lattics gas model @xcite .    for completeness",
    "we describe the canonical thermodynamic model in section ii . in the next section we set up the grand canonical model to get to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "subsequent sections will show the results .",
    "the thermodynamic model has been described in many places @xcite . for completeness and to enumerate the parameters we provide some details .",
    "we describe the model for one kind of particles only .",
    "the generalisation to two kinds could be found in @xcite .",
    "if there are @xmath3 identical particles of only one kind in an enclosure at temperature @xmath4 , the partition function of the system can be written as @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the partition function of one particle . for a spinless particle",
    "this is @xmath7 ; @xmath8 is the mass of the particle ; @xmath9 is the available volume within which each particle moves ; @xmath10 corrects for gibb s paradox .",
    "if there are many species , the generalisation is @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the partition function of a composite which has @xmath13 nucleons . for a dimer @xmath14 , for a trimer @xmath15 etc .",
    "equation ( 2.2 ) is no longer trivial to calculate .",
    "the trouble is with the sum in the right hand side of eq . (",
    "the sum is restrictive .",
    "we need to consider only those partitions of the number @xmath3 which satisfy @xmath16 .",
    "the number of partitions which satisfies the sum is enormous when a is large .",
    "we can call a given allowed partition to be a channel .",
    "the probablity of the occurrence of a given channel @xmath17 is @xmath18 the average number of composites of @xmath13 nucleons is easily seen from the above equation to be @xmath19 since @xmath20 , one readily arrives at a recursion relation @xcite @xmath21 for one kind of particle , @xmath22 above is easily evaluated on a computer for @xmath3 as large as 3000 in matter of seconds .",
    "it is this recursion relation that makes the computation so easy in the model .",
    "of course , once one has the partition function all relevant thermodynamic quantities can be computed .",
    "we now need an expression for @xmath23 which can mimic the nuclear physics situation .",
    "we take @xmath24 where the first part arises from the centre of mass motion of the composite which has @xmath25 nucleons and @xmath26 is the internal partition function . for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and for @xmath29",
    "it is taken to be @xmath30\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , as in @xcite , @xmath31=16 mev is the volume energy term , @xmath32 is a temperature dependent surface tension term and the last term arises from summing over excited states in the fermi - gas model .",
    "the value of @xmath33 is taken to be 16 mev .",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath32 used here is @xmath34^{5/4}$ ] with @xmath3518 mev and @xmath36 mev . in the nuclear case",
    "one might be tempted to interpret @xmath9 of eq.(2.6 ) as simply the freeze - out volume but it is clearly less than that ; @xmath9 is the volume available to the particles for the centre of mass motion .",
    "assume that the only interaction between clusters is that they can not overlap one another .",
    "this assumption restricts the validity of the model to low density limit as was stressed in all previous applications of of the model . in the van der waals spirit",
    "we take @xmath37 where @xmath38 is taken here to be constant and equal to @xmath39 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath38 is inconsequential so long as it is taken to be constant .",
    "calculations employ @xmath9 ; the value @xmath38 enters only if results are plotted against @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the freeze - out density .    in the past , calculations with one kind of particle used the parametrisation of eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) for all @xmath25 s however large .",
    "this means that if the system has @xmath3 nucleons , the largest possible cluster allowed in the system also has @xmath3 nucleons . while we will show a few cases with this specification we will also consider a variation .",
    "we will take the value of @xmath26 to be given by eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) up to a limit @xmath42 and zero afterwards .",
    "when @xmath43 , this simply means that the largest cluster has @xmath44 nucleons .",
    "using standard definitions : @xmath45 and pressure @xmath46 we arrive at @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49k^{2/3}$ ] . the last term in @xmath50",
    "was neglected in @xcite .",
    "it is included here but makes little difference .",
    "the expression for pressure is @xmath51 multiplicity @xmath8 is given by @xmath52 .",
    "if there were only monomers in the grand canonical ensemble one would solve @xmath53 where @xmath54 of section ii . given @xmath41 and @xmath4",
    "one then finds the chemical potential @xmath55 .",
    "the number of particles is then given by @xmath56 where @xmath9 and @xmath3 are very large ( thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "the fluctuations in the number of particles implied by the use of grand canonical ensemble are then negligible compared to the average number @xmath3 .",
    "if we have a model where the only allowed species are monomers and dimers and the total particle number is very large one would solve : @xmath57 where phase - space consideration has implied that chemical equilibration exists , that is , the chemical potential of the dimer is twice that of the monomer , i.e. , @xmath58 .    for a system which is very large but , for which , the heaviest cluster has @xmath44 nucleons and no more , one needs to solve @xmath59 in this case , one might argue that one is considering a model in which the composites obey eq.(2.6 ) up to @xmath42 and @xmath23 s for @xmath60 are all zeroes .",
    "of course it is possible that both @xmath3 and @xmath44 are very large .",
    "use of the grand canonical ensemble always implies that @xmath3 is very large but @xmath44 may be large or small .",
    "pressure in the grand canonical model is calculated from @xmath61 which in this model reduces to @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "notice that formally this eq . is same as eq.(2.9 ) but , of course , @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( 2.9 ) is calculated according to the canonical formula , eq.(2.4 ) .",
    "in @xcite where the canonical thermodynamic model was first studied for phase transitions , it was pointed out that for a given density @xmath41 , the specific heat per particle @xmath65 tends to @xmath66 at a particular temperature when the particle number @xmath3 tends to @xmath66 . since ,",
    "c_v=()_v = t ( ) _ v = -t ( ) _ v ,    a singularity in @xmath67 signifies a break in the first derivative of @xmath68 , the free energy and a first order phase transition .",
    "the specific heat @xmath0 in the model has been studied in more than one application and always found to be positive .",
    "we now turn our attention to @xmath1 studied in this canonical model .",
    "it is instructive to look at @xmath69 curves at different temperatures ( equation of state ) to gain an understanding ( fig.1 ) . for 200 particles ( @xmath3=200 and @xmath44=number of nucleons of the largest allowed cluster=200 ) this",
    "is drawn at three temperatures : @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath71 is only slightly higher than @xmath72 .",
    "we notice that on @xmath73 isothermals there are regions of mechanical instability where @xmath74 is negative .",
    "it is in this region that one encounters negative values for @xmath1 .",
    "instead of @xmath41 let us use the variable @xmath75 .",
    "thus regions of mechanical instability are characterised by @xmath760 .",
    "let us try to understand how this can happen . in simpler cases as in a gas of noninteracting monomers , the multiplicity @xmath8 ( which determines the pressure , i.e.",
    ", @xmath77 is simply @xmath3 and @xmath78 is always negative .",
    "( we actually use @xmath79 rather than @xmath8 for calculating @xmath80 but this is immaterial for our discussion ) . in the thermodynamic model , because of composites , @xmath81 at moderate temperatures . at fixed temperature @xmath82",
    ", @xmath8 will always increase with @xmath9 .",
    "negative compressibility is marked by @xmath83 .",
    "let us consider points @xmath84 ( region of positive @xmath1 ) and points @xmath85 ( region of negative @xmath1 ) .",
    "points @xmath86 are on @xmath87 and points @xmath88 are on @xmath89 with @xmath90 . using    @xmath91 we arrive at @xmath92 in the region @xmath93 , @xmath94 is negative , @xmath95 ia always positive",
    "thus @xmath96 is negative .",
    "if @xmath8 goes down then so does the kinetic energy and also the potential energy ( creating more @xmath8 creates more surface and hence more energy ) .",
    "thus in this region with increasing temperature but constant pressure , both the kinetic and the potential energy of the system go down . in the `` normal '' region",
    "@xmath96 is positive and both the kinetic and the potential energies increase with @xmath4 at constant pressure .",
    "this is illustrared in table 1 .",
    "finally we show , in fig .",
    "2 , the caloric curve for a given pressure where in part of the curve temperature does go down with excitation energy .",
    "the fall is very gentle whereas the rise with energy when it happens is faster .",
    "the occurrence of a negative @xmath97 in spite of a positive @xmath67 is allowed in the following well - known relation @xcite :    c_p - c_v = vt    where @xmath98 is the volume coefficient expansion and @xmath99 is the isothermal compressibility given by : @xmath100 for negative @xmath99 , @xmath97 is less than @xmath67 and can become negative .    using the equality ,    ( )",
    "_ p = -()_t ( ) _ p    we can also write ,    c_p - c_v = vt ( ) _ v()_p .",
    "this shows that , @xmath97 can drop below @xmath67 if isobaric volume coefficient of expansion becomes negative which is the case in some regions of fig.1 .",
    "for @xmath3 very large but n=200 we use the grand canonical ensemble . for a given @xmath41 and @xmath4 ,",
    "we solve for @xmath55 where @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) is set at 200 . in the @xmath69 diagram",
    "there are no regions of mechanical instability ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the @xmath69 diagram for @xmath101 but @xmath3=200 obtained by the canonical calculation is also shown in the same figure .",
    "we see that in the low density side ( the gas phase ) the two diagrams coincide .",
    "the rise of pressure with density is quite rapid and linear .",
    "after the two diagrams separate , the rise of pressure with density in the grand canonical model slows down considerably but there is no region of mechanical instability although the canonical calculation with 200 particles has a region of instability . in the grand canonical result which represents the thermodynamic extrapolation , we have not reached the classic liquid - gas coexistence limit where there would be no rise of pressure at all ( like in maxwell construction ) .",
    "we think the reason is this .",
    "the largest cluster has size 200 which is not a big enough number .",
    "condensation into the largest and larger clusters still does not behave like a liquid .",
    "we now increase the largest cluster size to 2000 . now",
    "the coexistence region is very clear and there is unmistakable signature of first order phase transition .",
    "this grand canonical result is very close to the case where @xmath102 ( see fig . 3 in @xcite ) . in the same figure",
    "we also show results of a canonical calculation with @xmath3=2000 and @xmath44=2000 .",
    "the region of mechanical instability has gone down considerably but it has not disappeared showing that we have not reached the thermodynamic limit yet .",
    "the mechanical instability which led to negative values of @xmath1 is not only a finite number effect but it is also dependent on details of parameters ; see also @xcite . as in fig.3",
    "we draw a @xmath69 diagram for 200 particles in fig .",
    "4 but now the largest cluster has @xmath103 , that is , @xmath23 is given by eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) up to @xmath25=100 and is zero for @xmath104 .",
    "the mechanical instability region has completely disappeared .",
    "in fact , the negative compressility in the @xmath69 diagram in fig .",
    "4 disappears even with the following minimal change .",
    "we use @xmath26 of eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) upto @xmath105 and for @xmath104 use @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "we were surprised that with such small changes zones of negative compressibility disappeared but such consequences were anticipated in other models before @xcite .",
    "in this section we deal with two kinds of particles and discuss the behaviours of chemical potentials as the proton fraction of large systems changes .",
    "this is remotely connected with specific heats but the behaviour of chemical potentials with the proton fraction has attracted some attention in recent times and we felt that it is of general interest to show what the behaviour is in the themodynamic model . it was shown that in mean - field theories of nuclear matter there is chemical instability as a function of @xmath107 in limited regions of @xmath108 , that is , @xmath109 becomes negative in some region of @xmath110 plane ( correspondingly @xmath111 becomes positive ) .",
    "this is analgous to mechanical instability as a function of density @xcite .",
    "we have seen that in the thermodynamic model there are no regions of mechanical instability for large systems ( the grand canonical results ) .",
    "we will see that there is no chemical instability either in the model in the large particle number limit .",
    "now we need to consider the thermodynamic model for two kinds of particles . for details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "a composite has two indices : @xmath13=proton number , @xmath112=neutron number with @xmath113 .",
    "analogous to eq.(2.4 ) we have @xmath114 where the nuclear properties are contained in @xmath115 : @xmath116 we take the internal partition function of the composite to be @xmath117\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as is usual in all infinite matter case calculations , the coulomb interaction is switched off .",
    "we take @xmath118 mev , @xmath119 mev,@xmath120=23.5 mev and @xmath33=16.0 mev . for @xmath121",
    "we use this formula . for lower masses",
    "we simulate the no coulomb case by setting the binding energy of @xmath122he = binding energy of @xmath122h and binding energy of @xmath123li = binding energy of @xmath123h .    for a given @xmath124",
    "what are the limits on @xmath13(or @xmath125 ) ? this is a non - trivial question . in the results we will show , we have taken the limits by calculating the drip lines of protons and neutrons as given by the binding energy formula .",
    "limiting oneself to within the drip lines is a well - defined prescription , but is likely to be an underestimation since resonances show up in particle - particle correlation experiments . on the other hand , for a given @xmath124 ,",
    "taking limits of @xmath13 from 0 to @xmath124 is definitely an overestimation .    in fig .",
    "5 we have drawn isothermals ( at @xmath4=6.0 mev ) for two component nuclear systems for different @xmath108 s in the grand canonical ensemble . we restrict @xmath108 between 0.3 and 0.5 and @xmath126 between 0 and 0.5 , the ranges for which the thermodynamic model is expected to be reliable . in the calculation the largest cluster is taken to be @xmath127 .",
    "the same figure also shows the behaviours of @xmath128 and @xmath129 at constant pressure .",
    "the derivative @xmath130 is seen to be always positive ( simultaneously @xmath131 is negative ) . in the next figure , for completeness",
    ", we have continued the model beyond @xmath126=0.5 and gone upto the highest possible limit of @xmath132 in the model to see the behaviour of @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "no chemical instability is seen .",
    "we have shown that with usual concepts one can obtain a negative value of @xmath133 in part of the @xmath134 plane within the framework of a thermodynamic model .",
    "although we have shown this , for the sake of simplicity , using one kind of particle only , we have checked that the phenomenon remains when a more complicated version with two kinds of particles and realistic binding energies for the composites are used .",
    "the @xmath67 is positive and its origin is the cost in surface energy to break large clusters into smaller clusters and nucleons .",
    "a negative @xmath97 is seen in our exactly soluble canonical ensemble model for small systems .",
    "this negative value arises in regions of mechanical instability where the isothermal compressiblity is negative or equivalently , the isobaric volume expansion coefficient is negative . a negative isobaric volume expansion leads to a decrease in multiplicity , or total number of clusters , with temperature and a corresponding decrease in energy . for larger systems these regions disappear and in the grand canonical limit , @xmath97 is always positive .    since several papers",
    "have demonstrated the existence of negative specific heats it is pertinent to mention the relevance of our work to these earlier works .",
    "our model is not , in any simple way , connected to negative specific heat found in ten dimensional potts model @xcite .",
    "the specific heat considered in that work is @xmath67 and the negative specific heat appears only in microcanonical treatment .",
    "the negative specific heat seen here is at least partially similar to that seen in .",
    "there is no negative specific heat in @xmath67 @xcite but it makes its presence felt when @xmath133 is considered @xcite .",
    "although our model is quite different from the one considered in @xcite the results are similar .",
    "unfortunately we can not recommend any experiments to verify the conclusions of this paper .",
    "nuclear disasembly in heavy ion collisions can not be fine tuned .",
    "there is no reason to think that it takes place exactly at constant volume or exactly at constant pressure .",
    "calculations at constant volume gives quite reasonable predictions for observables that have been measured @xcite but this does not rule out the possibility that variations happen .",
    "if disassembly always took place at constant pressure then the following idealised experiment would be useful .",
    "one measures excitation energy per particle and also the temperature .",
    "one would then find there are cases where the average excitation energy per particle goes down even though the temperature rises .",
