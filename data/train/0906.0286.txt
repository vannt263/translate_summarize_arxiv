    "the @xmath298 amplitude ( [ regge_amplitude ] ) is used to calculate the corresponding cross section including limitations of the four - body phase - space .    to excludes resonance regions we `` correct '' the regge parametrization ( [ regge_propagators ] ) by multiplying byfactors @xmath299 ( as in [ wpin_correction_factor ] ) . in fig.[fig : dsigma_dmpipi_full_space_b ] we show the two - pion invariant mass distribution of the double - diffractive background together with the @xmath0 signal ( @xmath224 fusion ) .",
    "we show three curves corresponding to different cuts on both @xmath300 : @xmath301 = 2.0 ( solid ) , 1.9 ( dashed ) , 1.8 ( dotted ) gev .",
    "the figure suggests that the double - diffractive background should not disturb observing the @xmath0 signal at the panda experiment energies .    in this case ,",
    "unlike for the two - pion involved @xmath237 exchange discussed in the previous subsection , imposing cuts on pion rapidities would not be helpful as the double - diffractive contribution is concentrated at midrapidities as shown in fig.[fig : dsigma_dypi_b ] . at lower hesr energies",
    "the situation is better , the double - diffractive two - pion background is relatively smaller .     pion - pion invariant mass distribution for @xmath0 ( solid line ) and the double - diffractive background ( dashed lines ) for different ( sharp ) cut - off for @xmath300 .",
    "here the full phase space has been included .",
    "the calculation was performed for the highest panda center - of - mass energy @xmath76 = 5.5 gev.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     rapidity distribution of pions from the decay of the glueball candidate @xmath0 ( solid line ) and from the double - diffractive background ( dashed lines ) for different ( sharp ) cut - off for @xmath300 . for the background we impose in addition : 1.4 gev @xmath263 1.6 gev .",
    "the calculation was performed for the highest panda center - of - mass energy @xmath76 = 5.5 gev.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "for the first time in the literature we have estimated the cross section for exclusive @xmath0 meson ( glueball candidate ) production not far from the threshold .",
    "we have included both gluon induced diffractive and triangle - double - diffractive mechanisms as well as the pion - pion exchange contributions .    the qcd diffractive component was obtained by extrapolating down the cross section in the khoze - martin - ryskin approach with unintegrated gluon distributions from the literature as well as using two - gluon impact factor approach . a rather large uncertainties are associated with the qcd diffractive component . at present only upper limit can be obtained for the diffractive component as the @xmath302 decay coupling constant remains unknown .",
    "the coupling constant could be extracted only in high - energy exclusive production of @xmath0 where other mechanisms are negligible .",
    "we have found rather large contribution of pionic - triangle - double - diffractive component at higher energies ( @xmath303 10 gev ) .",
    "however , at the gsi hesr energies this contribution is strongly damped because of the phase space limitations on the @xmath127 subchannel energies .",
    "the calculation of the mec contribution requires introducing extra vertex form factors . at largest panda energies they are relatively well known and",
    "the pion - pion fusion can be reliably calculated .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated very close to the threshold where rather large @xmath304 and @xmath305 are involved .",
    "the cross section for energies close to the threshold is very sensitive to the functional form and parameters of vertex form factor .",
    "therefore a measurement of @xmath0 close to its production threshold could limit the so - called @xmath216 form factors in the region of exchanged four - momenta never tested before .",
    "we predict the dominance of the pion - pion contribution close to the threshold .",
    "our calculation shows that the diffractive components ( in fact its upper limit for the qcd mechanism ) are by more than order of magnitude smaller than the pion - pion fusion component in the energy region of future panda experiment",
    ".    the diffractive components may dominate over the pion - pion component only for center - of - mass energies @xmath257 15 gev .",
    "taking into account rather large uncertainties the predictions of this component should be taken with some grain of salt . clearly an experimental program is required to disentangle the reaction mechanism at energies @xmath257 15 gev .    disentangling the mechanism of the exclusive @xmath0 production",
    "not far from the meson production threshold would require study of the @xmath203 , @xmath204 processes with the panda detector at fair and @xmath118 reaction at j - parc . in the case",
    "the pion exchange mechanism is a dominant process one expects : @xmath306 . at high energies , when the gluonic , or double - diffractive with intermediate triangle , components dominate over mec components @xmath307 .    at intermediate energies",
    "one can not exclude a priori subleading reggeon exchanges like @xmath218 for instance .",
    "however , we do not know how to reliably calculate them from first principles .",
    "we believe that the distortions from the pion - pion at low energies and/or distortions from the qcd gluonic mechanism at high energy may tell us more and allow for a phenomenological analysis taking into account the @xmath218 component explicitly .",
    "we leave this problem for a future analysis when experimental data will be available .",
    "only a careful studies of different final channels in the broad range of energies could help to shed light on coupling of ( nonperturbative ) gluons to @xmath0 and therefore would give a new hint on its nature .",
    "the experimental studies of exclusive production of @xmath0 are not easy at all as in the @xmath224 decay channel one expects a large continuum .",
    "we have performed an involved calculation of the four - body @xmath308 background .",
    "our calculation shows that imposing extra cuts should allow to extract the signal of the glueball @xmath0 candidate at the highest panda energy .",
    "a partial wave @xmath224 analysis should be helpful in this context .",
    "the two - pion continuum will be studied in more detail in our future work .",
    "a smaller continuum may be expected in the @xmath309 or four - pion @xmath0 decay channel .",
    "this requires , however , a good geometrical ( full solid angle ) coverage and high registration efficiencies .",
    "panda detector seems to fulfill these requirements , but planning real experiment requires a dedicated monte carlo simulation of the apparatus .",
    "it is a central problem of our field if @xmath0 is a @xmath5 or glueball type .",
    "unfortunately , our analysis does not allow to give a definite answer to this important question .",
    "some information on baryon - baryon correlation may be helpful but certainly not decisive .",
    "if the cross section at high energies ( where the contribution of subleading reggeon exchanges may be neglected ) is much smaller than predicted based on the kmr method it means that gluons only weakly couple to @xmath0 .",
    "this could provide some indirect information on the @xmath0 structure .",
    "a direct comparison of the shape of differential distributions at high energies may provide a valuable test of the kmr method originally proposed for exclusive higgs production ( the latter experiment is very difficult as very small statistics is predicted ) . a possible disagreement with the prediction for exclusive @xmath0 production at high energies could put into question the kmr approach , at present state of art in the field .",
    "experiments at rhic could be useful in this context and could shed light on the nonperturbative coupling of gluons to @xmath0 .",
