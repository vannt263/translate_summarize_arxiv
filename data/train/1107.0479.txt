    "the main object of study of alice ( a large ion collider experiment ) is matter at extremely high energy density created in central collisions of heavy ions at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the expansion rate and the spatial extent at decoupling of the highly compressed strongly - interacting system created in these collisions are accessible via intensity interferometry , a technique which exploits the bose  einstein enhancement of identical bosons emitted close by in phase - space .",

    "twiss analysis ( hbt )  @xcite , has been successfully applied in  @xcite , hadron  hadron and lepton ",

    "the data were collected in 2010 during the first lead beam running period of the lhc . for the present analysis we have used @xmath0 events that correspond to the most central 5% of the hadronic cross section .",

    "the correlation analysis was performed using charged - particle tracks detected in the inner tracking system ( its ) and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) of alice .",
    "the two - particle correlation function is defined as the ratio @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the measured distribution of the difference @xmath4 between the three - momenta of the two particles @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the corresponding distribution formed by using pairs of particles where each particle comes from a different event ( event mixing ) .",
    "the efficiency with which two tracks are reconstructed within the tpc is a function of the separation between them .",
    "track splitting ( incorrect reconstruction of a signal produced by one particle as two tracks ) and track merging ( reconstructing one track instead of two ) generally lead to structures in the two - particle correlation functions if not properly treated . in this analysis ,",
    "the track splitting effect is negligible and the track merging leads to a 20 - 30% loss of track pairs with a distance of closest approach in the tpc of 1  cm or less .",
    "this can be demonstrated by studying , in monte carlo simulations , distributions of reconstructed pairs in the @xmath8 plane .",
    "the two variables represent the longitudinal opening angle and the transverse angular separation at a given cylindrical radius , respectively , and are defined as @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the initial transverse opening angle and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the two transverse momenta in gev@xmath13 ; the cylindrical radius @xmath14 is in m. the pair inefficiency in the separation variable @xmath15 is found to be sharpest at @xmath16  m ( fig .",

    "the factor @xmath23 is the squared coulomb wave function averaged over a spherical source of size equal to the mean of , , and .    the finite momentum resolution in the tpc smears out the correlation peak causing the extracted radii to be smaller than they actually are .",
    "this effect arises from the finite position resolution and from multiple scattering .",
    "the effect was studied by applying weights to pairs of tracks in simulated events so as to produce the correlation function expected for a given set of the hbt radii ( fig .",

    "the reconstructed radii were found to differ from the input ones by up to 4% , depending on the radius and .",

    "the hbt radii show a decreasing trend with increasing which is a characteristic feature of expanding particle sources .",

    "the product of the three radii is related to the homogeneity volume and is found to be two times larger at lhc than at rhic ( fig .",
