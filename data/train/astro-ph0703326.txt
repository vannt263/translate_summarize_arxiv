    "among nearby neutron stars , seven show predominantly thermal emission , with inferred temperatures of @xmath2 to 100ev .",
    "these so - called isolated neutron stars ( ins ) are thought to be young , @xmath3myr old , with the emission due to residual heat .",
    "compared to similarly aged pulsars , they have much weaker non - thermal emission , longer , 310s periods , and stronger , few @xmath4 g magnetic fields ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the ins have attracted much attention , in part because of the hope that the equation of state in the ultra - dense interior could be constrained using properties derived from their spectra , such as effective temperature , surface gravity , and gravitational redshift .",
    "progress has been stymied , however , by difficulties in interpreting the spectra : at present , hydrogen , helium , and mid - z elements , in states ranging from gaseous to condensed , all being considered ( see , e.g. , contributions to @xcite ) .",

    "xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _  spectra appeared to be featureless , blackbody - like @xcite , similar to those of the brightest ins , ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but more detailed analysis uncovered a weak , broad absorption feature near 280ev @xcite .",
    "similarly broad ( but stronger ) features at energies from 200 to 700ev were found in five other ins @xcite and are generally interpreted as proton cyclotron or neutral - hydrogen transitions . for rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 , either interpretation is consistent with the magnetic field strength @xmath5 g inferred from timing ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) .    unlike other ins , however , the spectrum of rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  changed @xcite .",
    "the change could be described as an increase in temperature , from 86 to @xmath6ev , and an increase in equivalent width of the absorption feature , from @xmath7 to @xmath8ev ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) .",
    "the nature of the changes is unclear . @xcite and @xcite",

    "[ sec : spectra ] , and suggest that only part of the surface changed .",
    "we discuss implications in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we used _ chandra _  to observe rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  several times in 2005 and 2006 , for @xmath10ks total , taking spectra with the low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letg ) . for comparison , we analysed archival spectra taken in 2000 ( @xmath11ks ) and 2004 ( @xmath12ks ) , as well as spectra of another ins , rx  j1308.6 + 2127 , taken in ( @xmath13ks ) .    for all observations , we extracted spectra following standard procedures ( we used ciao ver .  3.3 and caldb ver .  3.2 ) .",

    "2004 effective areas , and calculated photon rates using the first - order effective areas .",
    "note that we implicitly assume diagonal response matrices , thus ignoring the letg line - spread function ; this should be fine for spectra without sharp features , like ours . finally , for timing purposes , we extracted barycentered source events ( following ) .",
    "we augmented our data with archival _ xmm _  observations . for timing purposes",
    ", we extracted barycentered source events from all epic instruments ( following ) , while for making lightcurves we extracted rgs spectra .",
    "the latter was done with rgsproc ( xmmsas ver .",

    "the central wavelengths are indicated ; the widths are 5  for bands between 15 and 35 , and 10  for those from 45 to 65  ( the latter bands are not covered by rgs ) . for clarity ,",

    "to determine the timescale on which the spectral changes occurred , we used the letg and rgs spectra to produce lightcurves in eight wavelength bands ( fig .  [",

    "broadly , these confirm previous results ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) : as time passed , the flux increased at wavelengths @xmath15 , and decreased in the range @xmath16 , presumably because the absorption feature deepened . however , with the new rgs long - wavelength efficiencies , the evidence for a decrease in 2536  flux before 2003 has largely disappeared ( but the first letg and rgs observations have become discrepant , suggesting some calibration issues remain ) .",
    "figure [ fig : lightcurves ] shows that most of the change occurred rapidly , in between the 2003 may and 2003 october _ xmm _  observations . before and after , there are slower variations , with those before in the same sense as the rapid change , and those after in the opposite one .",
    "this is consistent with inferences from pn data by . to examine broad - band changes",
    ", we integrated the letg fluxes in the 1080  range ( 0.1551.25kev ) , finding totals of 0.97 , 1.06 , 1.04 , 1.02 , 1.04 , and @xmath17 for the six observations , respectively ( with @xmath18 uncertainty ) .",
    "thus , from 2000 to 2004 the flux increased by @xmath19 , and afterwards it possibly decreased slightly .",
    "the change of the total source flux is likely similar : most flux is emitted in the 1080  band , and , despite the change in spectral shape , different epochs have extinction corrections identical to @xmath20 ( e.g. , factor 1.43 for @xmath21 ) .    suggested the changes were cyclic , with a @xmath9yr period , but the lightcurves do not require this .",

    "[ fig : spectra ] , we show the letg spectrum from 2000 , taken before this time , as well as the average of all letg spectra taken after 2003 ( the further small changes in 2004 and 2005 [ fig .",

    "the comparison of the spectra raises two main questions .",
    "first , for rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 , how can the appearance of a pronounced absorption feature be associated with only a small change in temperature ( from @xmath49 to @xmath50ev ; ) ?",
    "second , why is the absorption feature in rx  j1308.6 + 2127  much stronger than that in rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  ( in either state ) ?    of these two questions , we believe the answer to the second may be simple : that not the whole but only part of the surface changed .",
    "if so , then the ` after ' spectrum contains a contribution from unchanged parts that emit the cooler , nearly featureless ` before ' spectrum .",
    "hence , the spectrum from the changed part should be hotter and should have a stronger line than one would infer from the average",
    ".    we do not know the relative contribution of the ` before ' spectrum , but an upper limit of @xmath51% is set by the requirement that it does not exceed the ` after ' spectrum at any wavelength ( set by the 3540  region ; fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) . for a contribution near this limit",
    ", the absorption feature in the changed parts of the surface would be very strong , just as observed in rx  j1308.6 + 2127 .",
    "indeed , if we subtract the ` before ' spectrum , scaled by two thirds , from the ` after ' spectrum , the residual is remarkably similar to the spectrum of rx  j1308.6 + 2127  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the epic - pn data ( mori et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we have found that most of the spectral variations in rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  occurred on a short , less than half - a - year timescale , and that , coincident with this , there likely was an increase in spin frequency .",
    "we also showed that the ` after ' spectrum could be reproduced if one third of the emission changed from the blackbody - like ` before ' spectrum to something similar to the emission of rx  j1308.6 + 2127 , and we suggested only part of the visible surface changed . here , we will interpret these findings assuming an impulsive event ( see for a discussion in terms of precession ) .",
    "as the observations show evidence for a reversal , we need to address not only the nature and cause of the change , but also how it can be undone .",
    "it is difficult to understand the change without knowing the composition and state at the photosphere (  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the order - of - magnitude increase in strength of the absorption feature suggests , however , that a new species became dominant , due to a change in ionisation balance , state ( e.g. , from condensed to gaseous ) , or composition .    in principle , a temperature change could affect the ionisation balance or state , and one could envisage heating due to a sudden energy release associated with , e.g. , a glitch , and subsequent cooling on a timescale set by the release depth . however , the average observed flux before and after the event differs by only @xmath7% . even if due to only one third of the surface , the implied increase in effective temperature is at most  4% ( find a 6% change in average temperature from spectral fits , but this may simply reflect that a model of a blackbody with a gaussian absorption line is not realistic . ) with such a small change , it is not clear the atmosphere and spectrum could change so drastically .    an easier explanation for the strengthening of the absorption feature would be a change in composition , e.g. , due to an accretion episode .",
    "such a change could also lead to a small increase in effective temperature , since heat conduction is faster for lighter elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . but how to undo the change",
    "for hydrogen , there is a possible mechanism @xcite : for @xmath5 g and @xmath52k , hydrogen will be burnt diffusively on carbon in @xmath53yr ( where @xmath54 is the hydrogen column density ) , with substantial uncertainty due to the composition of the underlying layers .",
    "a thin hydrogen layer , superposed on a condensed surface , has been invoked by @xcite and @xcite to explain the featureless spectra of some ins . for rx",
    "j0720.4@xmath03125 , it would imply a very thin hydrogen layer before the change , and a thicker one on parts of the surface afterwards .    among the two possibilities mentioned above  a glitch in the neutron - star crust and an accretion episode ",
    "the former would most naturally explain the timing results ; indeed , the fractional increase in spin frequency of @xmath55 would not be unusual for an older radio pulsar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also for magnetars ,",
    "glitches are observed , as well as slow changes on timescales of years ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the glitch could release some energy , causing a temperature increase that depends on the release depth ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , it could induce magnetospheric currents , which could produce hydrogen and helium on the surface by spallation ( as suggested for rx j1856.5@xmath03754 by @xcite ) .",
    "accretion would naturally lead to a change in composition , as well as , by its associated angular momentum , a change in spin .",
    "matter could originate in an asteroid or comet belt such as has been invoked to explain timing noise , nulling and other pulsar properties by @xcite . if accretion started due to a collision between asteroids , low - rate accretion of smaller debris could perhaps cause the slower changes .",
    "the observed frequency change requires an accreted mass of @xmath56@xmath57 g , depending on accretion regime and properties of accreting matter ( large bodies accreting directly onto the star , small grains destructed and ionized before reaching the alfven surface , etc . ) .",
    "the accretion would result in an energy of @xmath58@xmath59erg being released in a relatively short time , hence a high luminosity .",
    "we have checked the _",
    "rxte _ all - sky monitor ( asm ) data in 2003 may - october and found no emission from rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 ; however , given the low asm duty cycle , a short - lived ( @xmath60ks ) event could easily be missed .    in future , the above ideas  as well as the alternative suggestion of precession  can be tested .",
    "for instance , both give different predictions for future timing .",
    "generally , if hydrogen appeared on the surface ( or hydrogen - covered parts became visible ) , the optical flux should perhaps have increased , yet it changed by @xmath61 @xcite . also , if the composition changed locally , e.g. , near a magnetic pole , matter might diffuse outwards , perhaps leading to further slow changes .",
    "if so , one would also expect that the pulse profile evolved , perhaps being most sharply peaked , especially at high energies , shortly after the event . from the pn data ,",
    "this indeed appears to be the case ( mori et al .",
