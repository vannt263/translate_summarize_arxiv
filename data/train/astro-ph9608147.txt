    "while the baryonic content of spiral galaxies that are observed in the present epoch is concentrated in stars , in the past this must have been in the form of gas .",
    "the principal gaseous component in spiral galaxies is hi which has led to surveys for absorption systems detected by the damped lines they produce ( wolfe  1986 [ wtsc ] ; lanzetta  1991 [ lwtlmh ] ; lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek 1995 [ lwt ] , wolfe  1995 ) . damped absorption systems have neutral hydrogen column densities of @xmath9 atoms @xmath4 and they dominate the baryonic mass contributed by hi . we extend the earlier work on damped systems to higher redshifts using twenty - six qsos from the apm damped survey ( storrie - lombardi  1996 [ smih ] , storrie - lombardi , irwin & mcmahon 1996 [ sim ] ) , with eleven candidate or confirmed damped ly@xmath10 absorption systems covering the redshift range @xmath11 ( 8 with z @xmath1 3.5 ) .",
    "these data more than triple the redshift path surveyed at z @xmath1 3 and allow the first systematic study up to z @xmath7 4.7 .",
    "the mean cosmological mass density contributed by absorbers can be estimated as @xmath13 giving the current mass density in units of the current critical density ( lwtlmh ) .",
    "@xmath14 is the mean molecular weight of the gas which is taken to be 1.3 ( 75% h and 25% he by mass ) , @xmath15 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , @xmath16 is the current critical mass density , @xmath17 is the low end of the  column density range being investigated , and @xmath18 is the column density distribution function . unfortunately @xmath18 is not a simple function and its evolution with redshift is difficult to accurately quantify ( lwt , sim ) . the integral in equation  [ eqnomega",
    "] can be estimated using @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the absorption distance interval .",
    "the absorption distance @xmath21 is used to remove the redshift dependence in the sample and put everything on a comoving coordinate scale .",
    "if the population of absorbers is nonevolving (  the product of their space density multiplied by their cross - section does not change with redshift ) they have a constant number density per unit absorption distance . in a standard friedmann universe @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 & if q$_0=0.5$;\\cr                { 1 \\over 2}[(1+z)^2 - 1 ]     & if q$_0=0$. } \\label{absdis2eqn}\\ ] ] ( bahcall & peebles 1969 ; cf .  tytler 1987 ) .",
    "the errors in  are also difficult to estimate without knowing @xmath18 .",
    "lwtlmh used the standard error in the distribution of which yields zero error if all the column densities in a bin are the same .",
    "we have estimated the fractional variance in   by comparing the observed distribution of @xmath18 with the equivalent poisson sampling process .",
    "this gives @xmath23 and @xmath24 fractional errors if all the column densities included in a bin are equal . to address uncertainties in @xmath18",
    "we also calculated a maximum likelihood estimate of the errors in the hi column density .",
    "we used the power law with an exponential turnover form of the column density distribution function ,  the gamma - distribution from sim @xmath25 with log @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . unlike a pure power law",
    "this form has a finite integral mass .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimates of the errors agree well with the fractional variance .",
    "lwt found that   inferred from studies of damped systems rises with increasing redshift for 0.008 @xmath0 z @xmath0 3.5 .",
    "for the range 3.0 @xmath0 z @xmath0 3.5 which included 4 damped systems and was the the highest redshift bin in the study , @xmath5 was twice @xmath6 .",
    "this implied a much larger amount of star formation must have taken place between z@xmath73.5 and z@xmath72 than is indicated by metallicity studies .",
    "specifically , pettini  ( 1994 ) measured a low mean metallicity in damped systems at z@xmath292.2 inferring that they are observed prior to the bulk of star formation in the disk .",
    "the lwt result also implied that the bulk of stars in nearby galaxies should be metal poor whereas only a small fraction of disk stars in the solar neighbourhood are metal poor .",
    "this result presented a ` cosmic g - dwarf problem ' similar to the ` g - dwarf problem ' described in schmidt ( 1963 ) that comes about if bright and faint stars formed at the same rate and there was no accretion on to the disk of the galaxy .",
    "they concluded that the characteristic epoch of metal production in galaxies occurred after the characteristic epoch of star formation and that damped absorbers might trace disk as well as spheroid evolution .",
    "fall & pei ( 1993 ; and pei & fall 1995 ) have argued that obscuration caused by dust in damped systems could lead to significant underestimates of the neutral gas fraction at all redshifts , particularly in the range 1 @xmath30 z @xmath30 2 , also possibly explaining these results .    to further investigate these issues ,",
    "the high redshift confirmed and candidate damped systems discovered in the apm damped survey ( smih , sim ) have been combined with lower redshift samples ( wtsc , lwtlmh , lwt ) to study the evolution of  over the range 0.008 @xmath0 z @xmath0 4.7 .",
    "the combined data set includes 44 absorbers in 366 quasars .",
    "the results are tabulated in table 1 and shown in figure 1(a ) for q@xmath8=0 and 1(b ) q@xmath8=0.5 ( h@xmath8=50 ) following the format presented in wolfe  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the solid bins include the entire data set and the dashed bins exclude the new high redshift apm data .",
    "the region @xmath31 is the @xmath32 range for the mass density in stars in nearby galaxies ( gnedin & ostriker 1992 ) .",
    "the point at z@xmath70 is the value inferred from 21 cm emission from local galaxies ( fall & pei 1993 ; rao & briggs 1993 ) .",
    "the most striking result is  does not rise as steeply prior to z@xmath22 as indicated by previous studies .",
    "there is now evidence for a flattening in  at z@xmath22 and a possible turnover at z@xmath23 .",
    "this result , combined with the decline at z@xmath13.5 in number density per unit redshift of damped systems with column densities log @xmath3 atoms @xmath4 ( sim ) points to an epoch at z  3 prior to which the largest damped systems are still forming .",
    "the decrease in number density at high redshift of the highest column density absorbers is in marked contrast to the more numerous lower column density systems , lyman - limit systems ( @xmath33 atoms @xmath4 ) ( storrie - lombardi  1994 ; stengler - larrea  1995 ) and forest absorbers ( @xmath34@xmath35 @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the apm survey data for z @xmath1 3 reduces significantly the value previously found for  in the bin 3 @xmath0 z @xmath0 3.5 .",
    "only one damped system is added to the existing four in this redshift range , but the absorption distance is doubled , which comes in to the calculation of  in the denominator in equation  [ eqnestfn ] ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the additional redshift path added by the apm survey is shown graphically by the sensitivity function in figure 6 of smih .",
    "we find that over the redshift range 2 @xmath0 z @xmath0 4 the total mass in neutral gas ( ) is marginally comparable with the total visible mass in stars in present day galaxies ( @xmath31 ) for q@xmath8=0.5 .",
    "however , if one considers the total mass visible in stellar disks alone ,  excluding galactic bulges , the two values are comparable . using the result from schechter & dressler ( 1987 ) that galactic disks and bulges contribute equally to the mass density of the universe , we are observing a mass of neutral gas comparable to the mass of visible disk stars ,  @xmath2 @xmath36 .",
    "we note that the uncertainty in the total mass in visible stars in the local universe is comparable with our estimates of the mass in neutral gas at z @xmath1 2 . given this , and",
    "the fact that we do not know if damped systems are the precursors to galactic disks , bulges , or both , these results are difficult to interpret . if we make a plausible correction for obscuration by dust as advocated by pei & fall ( 1995 ) the  points shown in figure 1(b ) would migrate to the positions of the open circles shown in figure 2 . more work is needed to determine the severity of dust obscuration in optically selected qso surveys .",
    "an estimated 20% correction for the neutral gas not in damped systems is shown by the open squares .",
    "the shape of the  curve has been used by numerous authors to constrain theories of galaxy formation and cosmological models @xcite .",
    "they have found that cold@xmath37hot dark matter ( chdm ) models are incompatible with the previous results from the damped systems at z@xmath23 as they predict too few galactic halos .",
    "these models need to be reevaluated now that the value of ( z@xmath73 ) indicated from our new observations has changed significantly .",
    "for example , @xcite show a peak in  at z@xmath73 for various chdm models .",
    "though the error bars on  are still far too large to accurately discriminate between details of cosmological models , the overall shape has implications for structure formation .",
    "combining the new data from the apm high redshift survey extends studies of the cosmological mass density in neutral gas , , to z@xmath74.7 .",
    "we find evidence for a flattening in  at z@xmath22 and a possible turnover at z@xmath23 .",
    "though the turnover is not formally significant , when combined with the decline at z @xmath1 3.5 in number density of damped systems with column densities log @xmath3 atoms @xmath4 , these results point to an epoch prior to which the largest damped systems are still forming .",
    "previous studies indicated that @xmath5 was twice @xmath6 , implying a much larger amount of star formation must have taken place between z@xmath73.5 and z@xmath72 than is indicated by metallicity studies .",
    "the more gradual evolution we find in  alleviates this problem .",
    "the results are consistent with observations of damped systems at z@xmath292.2 that show a low mean metallicity , suggesting that they are observed prior to the bulk of star formation in the disk .",
    "we have also made an estimated correction to  to account for bias in optically selected quasar samples due to possible obscuration by dust in foreground absorbers .",
    "theories of galaxy formation and constraints on cosmological models utilising  should be reevaluated in light of the new observational results presented here .",
    "the error bars are still very large at high redshift and to differentiate between a peak versus a flattening in the  curve , larger samples of bright z @xmath1 3.5 quasars are needed to discover damped systems with z @xmath1 3 .",
