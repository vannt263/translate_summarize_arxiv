    "random walks figure prominently in a multitude of different physical problems .",
    "this is exemplified by such diverse fields as the polymer physics  @xcite , crystallographic statistics  @xcite , transport in disordered media  @xcite , bacterial motion , and other types of biological migration  @xcite .",
    "random walks with _ correlated _ displacements , model a host of phenomena .",
    "for example , the vacancy mechanism of atom diffusion in solids incorporates a correlation effect , since an atom has a larger probability to move backward to the hole it just vacated rather than onward  @xcite .",
    "correlations also arise in diffusion of guest molecules in zeolite channels  @xcite , electron hopping in coulomb glass  @xcite , motion of excitons at low temperatures in mixed naphthalene crystals  @xcite , etc . among the correlated walks ,",
    "the persistent random walk is possibly the simplest one to incorporate a form of momentum in addition to random motion  @xcite . in its basic realization on a one - dimensional lattice ,",
    "a persistent random walker possesses constant probabilities for either taking a step in the same direction as the immediately preceding one or for reversing its motion .",
    "firstly introduced by frth as a model for diffusion in a number of biological problems  @xcite , and shortly after by taylor in the analysis of turbulent diffusion  @xcite , the persistent random walk model is now generalized to study , e.g. , polymers  @xcite , chemotaxis  @xcite , cell movement  @xcite , and general transport mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "recently , the persistent random walk model is utilized in the description of diffusive light transport in foams  @xcite which is well established by experiments  @xcite .",
    "a relatively dry foam consists of cells separated by thin liquid films  @xcite .",
    "cells in a foam are much larger than the wavelength of light , thus one can employ ray optics and follow a light beam or photon as it is transmitted through the liquid films with a probability @xmath2 called the intensity transmittance .",
    "this naturally leads to a persistent random walk of the photons .",
    "special attention is paid to the light transport in the ordered honeycomb and kelvin structures , which have been used for an analytic access to the physical properties of disordered foams as exemplified by work on their rheological behavior  @xcite .",
    "symmetries of hexagonal and tetrakaidecahedral cells allow identifying specific one- and two - dimensional random walks , which are absent in disordered foams  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a first model , it is assumed that intensity transmittance does not depend on the incidence angle of photons and film thickness .",
    "nevertheless , analytical treatment of these peculiar and simple random walks facilitates interpretation of monte carlo simulations , in which topological disorder of foams and exact thin - film intensity transmittance are taken into account  @xcite .    in the ordered honeycomb ( kelvin ) structure ,",
    "the one - dimensional persistent walk arises when the photons move perpendicular to a cell edge ( face ) .",
    "thin - film transmittance depends on the film thickness .",
    "films are not expected to have the same thickness .",
    "these observations motivates us to consider persistent random walk on a one - dimensional lattice of _ random _ transmittances .",
    "we assume that transmittances at different sites are independent random variables , distributed according to a given probability density @xmath0 .",
    "our first approach to the problem is based upon a disorder expansion of the mean square - displacement due to kundu , parris , and phillips  @xcite . assuming that @xmath3 is finite , we validate the classical persistent random walk with an effective transmittance @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "inspired by this result , we generalize the effective medium approximation ( ema ) formulated by sahimi , hughes , scriven , and davis  @xcite to investigate the transport on a line with infinite @xmath6 .",
    "we show that if @xmath7 as @xmath8 , the mean square - displacement after @xmath9 steps is proportional to @xmath10 . if @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) as @xmath8 , we find that the mean square - displacement is proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "our monte carlo simulations confirm the anomalous diffusion of photons .",
    "quite interesting , we find that anomalous diffusion of persistent walkers and _ hopping _ particles on a site - disordered lattice  @xcite are similar . finally , for the experimental observation of the photon subdiffusion , we suggest a dielectric film stack to realize small transmittances .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we consider a one - dimensional lattice random walk in which steps are permitted to the nearest neigbor sites only .",
    "we normalize the length and duration of a step to 1 . at each site @xmath14",
    ", a walker either takes a step in the same direction as the immediately preceding one with a probability @xmath15 , or reverses its motion with a probability @xmath16 .",
    "here we assume symmetric transmittances , i.e. @xmath17 , as the transmittance of a thin - film is the same whether the light ray is going to the right ( @xmath18 ) or to the left ( @xmath19 ) direction .",
    "we assume that i ) transmittance at each site is a random variable , ii ) transmittances at two different sites are independent , iii ) transmittances at all sites are distributed according to a given normalized probability density @xmath0 .",
    "apparently @xmath20 .",
    "for any function @xmath21 , we define @xmath22 .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 @xmath24 the probability that the walker after its @xmath9th step arrives at site @xmath14 with positive ( negative ) momentum .",
    "a set of two master equations can be established to couple the probabilities at step @xmath25 to the probabilities at step @xmath9 : @xmath26    for the description of the photon distribution on the line , we do not need to specify the internal state ( @xmath27 ) explicitly .",
    "that means we are mainly interested in the probability that the photon arrives at position @xmath14 at step @xmath9 , @xmath28 from which we extract the first and second moments after @xmath9 steps as the characteristic features of a random walk : @xmath29 here the first bracket represents an ensemble average over all random transmittances , and the second bracket signifies an average with respect to the distribution @xmath30 .",
    "one obtains the classical persistent random walk assuming a constant transmittance @xmath2 at each site .",
    "translational invariance of the medium is then invoked to deduce the exact solution of @xmath30 in the framework of characteristic functions ( the spatial fourier transforms of probability distributions )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mean square - displacement of photons after @xmath31 steps can be obtained as @xmath32    considering a lattice of random transmittances with an almost narrow distribution @xmath0 , one may intuitively expect normal diffusion of the photons , and the validity of eq .",
    "( [ dif1 ] ) with an effective transmittance @xmath33 .",
    "however , a closer inspection reveals that even a few sites with small transmittances ( large reflectances ) may drastically hinder the photon diffusion : in the extreme limit where two transmittances are zero , photons are confined between two sites .",
    "this peculiar aspect of diffusion on a _",
    "one_-dimensional lattice , rules out the above guess . in the following section , we present a sound perturbative approach to the problem .",
    "many of the approaches to the transport in disordered media have the disadvantage of being restricted to one - dimensional problems . here we adopt the method of kundu et al .",
    "@xcite , which is applicable to two- and three - dimensional media .",
    "we obtain a series of approximate solutions for photon transport on a disordered line by transforming the master equation ( [ master1 ] ) to an equivalent but more appropriate integral equation for the characteristic function @xmath34 this crucial step can be achieved utilizing the generalized generating functions @xmath35 as will be shown in the following .",
    "first we simplify the set of coupled linear difference equations ( [ master1 ] ) using the method of the @xmath36-transform  @xcite explained in appendix  [ zt ] : @xmath37 we assume the initial conditions @xmath38 .",
    "now we multiply both sides of ( [ master2 ] ) with @xmath39 and sum over @xmath40 , which leads to @xmath41 where @xmath42 thus @xmath43 can be easily expressed in terms of @xmath44 . from eqs .",

    "successive approximations to the solution of integral equation ( [ masterintegral ] ) can be generated by the iteration method .",
