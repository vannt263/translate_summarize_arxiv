    "experimentally , the vast majority of data sensitive to parton densities have been taken without fixing the polarization of the initial beams or the target .",
    "the densities extracted in this way are usually refered to as the ` unpolarized ' parton distributions @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .    within roughly the last decade ,",
    "also more and more data have become available that are sensitive to the ` longitudinally ' polarized ( ` helicity  weighted ' ) parton densities of the nucleon .",
    "the tool to obtain such information has ( almost exclusively ) been deep ",
    "inelastic scattering ( dis ) of longitudinally polarized leptons and nucleons . the spin ",
    "asymmetry measured in such reactions is related to the probability for finding a certain parton ",
    "type with positive helicity in a nucleon of positive helicity _ minus _ the probability for finding it with negative helicity .",
    "these densities , denoted as @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) , contain information different from that contained in the more familiar unpolarized ones .    for a _ transversely _ polarized spin@xmath3 hadron one can define a further quark density  @xcite in very much the same way as the longitudinally polarized quark distributions , by taking differences of probabilities for finding quarks with transverse spin aligned and anti  aligned with the transverse hadron spin .",
    "these densities are called ` transversity ' densities and are denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that  unlike the situation for unpolarized and longitudinally polarized densities ",
    "there is _ no _ gluonic analogue of quark transversity  @xcite .",
    "this is due to angular momentum conservation : transversity densities are related to helicity  flip amplitudes .",
    "a gluonic helicity  flip amplitude would require the hadron to absorb two units of helicity , which no spin@xmath3 target can do .",
    "the transversity distributions are completely unmeasured so far since they can not be directly accessed in dis .",
    "it seems certain , however , that measurements of the @xmath5 will be attempted at the future polarized proton - proton collider rhic at brookhaven  @xcite . the most suitable candidate for such measurements",
    "is believed to be drell ",
    "yan dimuon production  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 complete the twist2 sector of parton densities of spin@xmath3 hadrons .",
    "nevertheless , we have not yet depleted the full set of parton densities that can be defined if spin is taken into account .",
    "there finally is a further spin ",
    "dependent _ gluon _ distribution that to some extent can be regarded as the gluonic counterpart of quark transversity . unlike the ` helicity ' density @xmath6 that describes _ circular _ polarization of the gluon , it is encountered if the gluon is _ linearly _",
    "polarized  @xcite .",
    "the density is denoted by @xmath7 and exists only in a linearly polarized hadron ( or photon  @xcite ) , which therefore has to have spin @xmath8 .",
    "there is no quark distribution in this case  @xcite . even though a measurement of @xmath9 does not seem very realistic at the moment , it possesses some interesting theoretical aspects which justify its analysis .",
    "table  1 summarizes the parton densities we have defined .",
    ".list of twist2 quark and gluon densities including spin  dependence .",
    "we have suppressed the ubiquitous argument @xmath10 of the densities .",
    "note that ` @xmath11 ' always runs over quarks as well as over antiquarks .",
    "labels @xmath12 denote helicities , @xmath13 transverse polarizations , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) stands for linear polarization along the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) axis , where the particle is moving along the @xmath18direction .",
    "subscripts refer to partons and superscripts to the parent hadron . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is important to realize that each set of parton densities in tab .  1 ( i.e. , each of the rows of tab",
    ".  1 ) is subject to its own set of evolution equations .",
    "for instance , the evolution of the longitudinally polarized densities proceeds independently from that of the unpolarized partons , and so forth . in this way",
    ", we are led to introducing separate sets of evolution kernels ( splitting functions ) for each type of polarization .",
    "the @xmath19evolution of the unpolarized densities has been worked out up to nlo accuracy of qcd already a long time ago  @xcite , and it has become standard since about ten years to analyse the unpolarized data within the nlo framework . the lo evolution of the @xmath2 , the @xmath20 , and of @xmath21 has also been known for a long time  @xcite , whereas the derivation of the nlo evolution kernels for longitudinally polarized partons has been a more recent development  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the nlo splitting functions for transversity were derived within three independent calculations  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss the nlo evolution of the @xmath5 , and its implications for an inequality between the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath5 derived by soffer  @xcite .",
    "we will also for the first time present the nlo evolution kernel for @xmath9 .",
    "since there are no gluons involved in the case of the transversity distributions , their evolution equations reduce to simple non - singlet type equations . introducing @xmath24 where the mellin moments are defined by @xmath25",
    "one has the evolution equations ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath26 for all flavours .",
    "the splitting functions @xmath27 are taken to have the following perturbative expansion : @xmath28 as indicated , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are equal at lo .",
    "similarly to  ( [ evol3 ] ) one has for linearly polarized gluons : @xmath31 where @xmath32 has a peturbative expansion analogous to  ( [ expan ] ) .",
    "these nlo evolution equations can be easily solved ; for details see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "historically , the evolution kernels for parton densities have been calculated within two rather different methods . on the one hand , the very powerful , yet quite formal , technique of the ` operator  product  expansion ' ( ope ) has been applied . here",
    "the evolution kernels are derived as anomalous dimensions of matrix elements of local operators .",
    "the other method is more intuitive and relies on parton model ideas and on the factorization of mass singularities in a physical ( ghost  free ) gauge  @xcite .",
    "this is the method we will use .",
    "very roughly , the strategy goes as follows : the nlo splitting functions are related to the residues of the collinear singularities in the _ next  to_nlo ( nnlo ) calculation of a partonic subprocess cross section for a ` physical ' process .",
    "being the pole part of this cross section , the singular terms are manifestly gauge_in_dependent .",
    "this means that we can employ a gauge in their calculation that simplifies the extraction of the mass singularities as much as possible . as was shown in  @xcite ,",
    "working in a physical gauge , like the light ",
    "cone gauge , reduces the number of singular graphs at a given order significantly .",
    "thus , a full nnlo calculation is clearly not required .",
    "in particular , only ladder  like diagrams , corresponding to a parton cascade , contribute to the pole part in such gauges , so that the cross section @xmath33 for any physical partonic process can be diagrammatically expanded into a sum of ladders of ` two  particle  irreducible ' kernels that are individually finite .",
    "mass singularities only occur on the lines connecting the kernels ( i.e. , on the ` sides ' of the ladders ) and can therefore be projected out easily using a projector @xmath34 that converts these lines into on  shell physical states .",
    "thus , the factorization of mass singularities can be achieved : the cross section @xmath33 decomposes into a finite part @xmath35 , and a function @xmath36 that contains all the collinear singularities and is universal since no process ",
    "dependence is left over in it .",
    "the function @xmath36 is then directly related to the splitting functions one is looking for  @xcite .    for the case of transversity , the projector @xmath37 is found to be @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the momentum of the particle emerging from the top of a kernel , @xmath40 is the gauge vector with @xmath41 , @xmath42 for the light  cone gauge , and @xmath43 is the transverse spin vector .",
    "more details on the calculation in the transversity case can be found in  @xcite .",
    "for linearly polarized gluons one has @xmath44 where the polarization vectors @xmath45 have non  vanishing entries only in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 components , respectively .",
    "a more detailed account of our calculation of @xmath46 will be given in a future publication  @xcite .",
    "our results for @xmath47 can be found in  @xcite and need not be repeated here .",
    "the one for @xmath46 is new and reads in the @xmath48 scheme @xmath49 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & n_c t_f \\left [ -\\frac{10}{9 } \\delta_l p_{gg}^{(0)}(x ) +   \\frac{1 - x^3}{3x } -\\frac{4}{3 } \\delta ( 1-x ) \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\   & -&c_f t_f \\left [ 2 \\frac{1 - x^3}{3x } + \\delta ( 1-x ) \\right ] \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the dilogarithm .",
    "furthermore , we have as usual @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 being the number of active flavours",
    ". finally , @xmath56 .",
    "we note that in @xcite a result for the part @xmath57 in ( [ pgglnlo ] ) at @xmath58 was presented , which corresponds to the two ",
    "loop splitting function for transitions between linearly polarized gluons and _ photons_. the result of @xcite disagrees with ours by a an additional factor @xmath59 in @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xcite therefore has to be in error , since a behaviour @xmath60 of the splitting function  more singular than the unpolarized one  can not be correct .",
    "there are two aspects of the result ( [ pgglnlo ] ) that deserve further attention .",
    "firstly , the small@xmath16 behaviour of the splitting function for linear polarization changes quite dramatically when going from lo to nlo . at lo ,",
    "the splitting function behaves @xmath61 as @xmath62 . at nlo",
    ", there are terms @xmath63 in the splitting function ( as one also encounters in the unpolarized case ) ; we have @xmath64 + { \\cal o } ( x )   \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; ( x\\rightarrow 0 ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] we note that all logarithmic terms @xmath65 cancel out in this limit .",
    "the other interesting point concerns the ` supersymmetric ' limit @xmath66 @xcite which has already been investigated for the unpolarized and the longitudinally polarized nlo splitting functions in  @xcite and for the ` time  like ' ones in  @xcite .",
    "one first of all finds that in the supersymmetric limit the lo splitting functions for quark transversity and for linearly polarized gluons become equal  @xcite : @xmath67 = \\delta_l p_{gg}^{(0 ) } ( x ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] thus , we have found the supersymmetric ` counterpart ' of transversity : linear polarization ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this nicely completes the supersymmetry relations found in the case of unpolarized and longitudinally polarized parton densities and fragmentation functions .",
    "the fact that two rather different polarizations are linked here is not too surprising as both of them are transverse in a certain sense .    to see whether the supersymmetric relation also holds at nlo",
    ", we have to transform the splitting functions to a regularization scheme that respects supersymmetry , dimensional reduction .",
    "the procedure here follows closely that discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the task is simplified by the fact that there are no parts @xmath68 in the @xmath69dimensional lo splitting functions for transversity or linearly polarized gluons at @xmath58 .",
    "such terms  which are always absent in dimensional reduction , but can be present for dimensional _ regularization _  are the reason why , for instance , the longitudinally polarized nlo splitting functions do not directly satisfy the supersymmetric relation in dimensional regularization , but have to be transformed to dimensional reduction first ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "the fact that the lo @xmath70terms are absent at @xmath58 in our case , means that our final results for the nlo transversity splitting function @xmath71 of  @xcite and for the nlo splitting function for linearly polarized gluons , eq .",
    "( [ pgglnlo ] ) , already coincide for @xmath58 with their respective @xmath48 expressions in dimensional _",
    "reduction_. we can therefore immediately compare these expressions in the supersymmetric limit .",
    "indeed , we find for @xmath66 : @xmath72 the satisfaction of the supersymmetric relation at @xmath73 is trivial ; see  @xcite , where the appropriate factorization scheme transformation to dimensional reduction at @xmath73 is given .",
    "we thus find that indeed the supersymmetric relation between the transversity splitting function and the evolution kernel for linearly polarized gluons is also verified at nlo .",
    "we note that the relation involves as expected the ` @xmath74-combination ' @xmath75 which corresponds to ` singlet ' evolution .",
    "finally , also note the miraculous cancellation of the terms @xmath63 in @xmath46 in the supersymmetric limit ( see eq .",
    "( [ smallx1 ] ) )  after all , such terms are not present in @xmath71 .",
    "the unpolarized , longitudinally and transversely polarized quark distributions ( @xmath11 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) of the nucleon are expected to obey the rather interesting relation @xmath78 derived by soffer @xcite .",
    "it has recently been clarified that soffer s inequation is preserved by leading order ( lo ) qcd evolution , i.e.  if ( [ soffer ] ) is valid at some scale @xmath79 , it will also be valid at @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "to nlo the situation is not as simple .",
    "the parton distributions are now subject to the choice of the factorization scheme which one may fix independently for @xmath11 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "one can therefore always find ` sufficiently incompatible ' schemes in which a violation of ( [ soffer ] ) occurs .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite with analytical methods that the inequality for valence densities is preserved by nlo qcd evolution in a certain ` drell - yan scheme ' in which the nlo cross sections for dimuon production maintain their lo forms , and also in the @xmath81 scheme . in this section , which is taken from  @xcite",
    ", we shall show numerically that soffer s inequation for sea quarks is also preserved under nlo ( @xmath81 ) evolution .",
    "we note that there is also a recent analytical proof of the preservation of soffer s inequality  @xcite at nlo .    for our study",
    ", we will assume saturation of soffer s inequality at the input scale for parton evolution .",
    "our choice for the r.h.s . of ( [ soffer1 ] ) will then be the nlo @xmath81 radiative parton model inputs for @xmath82 of @xcite and for the longitudinally polarized @xmath83 of the ` standard ' scenario of @xcite at @xmath84 gev@xmath85 . for simplicity we will slightly deviate from the actual @xmath82 of @xcite in so far as we will neglect the breaking of su(2 ) in the input sea quark distributions originally present in this set .",
    "this seems reasonable as su(2 ) symmetry was also assumed for the @xmath86 of @xcite , which in that case was due to the fact that in the longitudinally polarized case there are no data yet that could discriminate between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we therefore prefer to assume @xmath89 also for the transversity input .    in order to numerically check the preservation of ( [ soffer ] ) , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the ratio @xmath90 as a function of @xmath16 for several different @xmath19 values for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ( cf .",
    "( [ pm ] ) ) .",
    "if nlo evolution preserves soffer s inequality , then @xmath95 should not become larger than 1 for any @xmath96 . as we already know from @xcite",
    "this is the case for the two valence distributions .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] confirms that soffer s inequality is indeed also preserved for sea distributions .",
    "furthermore , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that evolution leads to a strong suppression of @xmath95 at small values of @xmath16 , in particular for the sea quarks .",
    "as is obvious from ( [ soffer ] ) , soffer s inequality only restricts the absolute value of the transversity distribution .",
    "therefore , we are free to choose the sign when saturating ( [ soffer ] ) , and we have to check the results for the two distinct possibilities @xmath97 ,  @xmath98 and @xmath97 ,  @xmath99 .",
    "our results do not noticeably depend on the actual choice .",
    "neither does it matter whether we decide to saturate soffer s inequality for the _ valence _ densities @xmath100 or for the full quark ( @xmath101 ) distributions at the input scale .",
    "one can utilise a saturated soffer inequality to derive upper bounds on the transverse double  spin asymmetry @xmath102 to be measured in transversely polarized drell - yan muon pair production at rhic .",
    "@xmath102 is defined as @xmath103 where the polarized and unpolarized hadronic cross sections are @xmath104 we employ the same input distributions as before , along with the same value for the initial scale @xmath79 .",
    "we choose @xmath105 for the factorization and renormalization scales , where @xmath106 is the invariant mass of the muon pair .",
    "further details of the calculation of the drell  yan cross section to lo and nlo can be found in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the transversely polarized @xmath107 cross section and the ` maximal ' double  spin asymmetry @xmath102 at lo and nlo for @xmath108 , corresponding to the rhic @xmath107 collider .",
    "we note that the region @xmath109 gev @xmath110 gev will presumably not be accessible experimentally since it will be dominated by muon pairs from bottomonium decays .",
    "the predicted maximal asymmetry is of the order of a few per cent .",
    "the expected statistical error bars have been included in the plot ; they have been calculated for @xmath111 beam polarization , an integrated luminosity @xmath112 , and @xmath113 detection efficiency .",
    "one concludes that asymmetries of this size should be well measurable at rhic .",
    "similar asymmetries are found  @xcite for another conceivable experimental situation , namely a proposed fixed ",
    "target experiment at hera that would utilise the possibly forthcoming polarized 820 gev hera proton beam on a transversely polarized target , resulting in @xmath114 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows similar results for the high - energy end of rhic , @xmath115 , where the integrated luminosity is expected to be @xmath116 .",
    "it turns out that the asymmetries become smaller as compared to the lower energies , but thanks to the higher luminosity the error bars become relatively smaller as well , at least in the region @xmath117 where the errors are approximately 1/10 of the maximal asymmetry .",
    "one can also clearly see in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the effect of @xmath118 exchange and the @xmath118 resonance .    a comparison of the lo and nlo results in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] answers one key question concerning the transversely polarized drell - yan process : our predictions for the maximal @xmath102 show good perturbative stability , i.e.  the nlo corrections to the cross sections and @xmath102 are of moderate size , albeit not negligible .",
    "finally , we also find a significantly reduced scale dependence of the results when going from lo to nlo .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the case @xmath108 .",
    "we plot here the maximal asymmetry in lo and nlo , varying the renormalization and factorization scales in the range @xmath119 .",
    "one can see that already the lo asymmetry is fairly stable with respect to scale changes , which is in accordance with the finding of generally moderate nlo corrections .",
    "the nlo asymmetry even shows a significant improvement , so that @xmath102 becomes largely insensitive to the choice of scale .",
