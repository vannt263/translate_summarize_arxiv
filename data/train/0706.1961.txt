    "it is well - known that every such @xmath3 contains a surface subgroup . indeed ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the number of `` inequivalent '' surface subgroups of @xmath3 grows factorially with the genus .",
    "lewis bowen has recently applied theorem [ main ] to show that every such @xmath3 contains a sequence of surface subgroups for which the hausdorff dimensions of the limit sets approach two ( see @xcite ) .",
    "given a free subgroup @xmath4 , we look at the convex core @xmath5 , which will be homeomorphic to a handlebody . replacing @xmath6 with a suitable nighborhood in @xmath1 , we can expand the handlebody to make it polyhedral , so that the boundary is a union of copies of the faces of @xmath4 . by expanding further , we can make the induced decomposition of the boundary finer and finer .",
    "if we expand enough , it becomes possible to attach mirrors to certain faces along the boundary ( see figure 1 ) , in such a way that the resulting 3-orbifold is the product of a compact 2-orbifold with an interval . the desired surface group is a finite - index subgroup of the 2-orbifold group .",
    "the first ingredient is the tameness theorem .",
    "let @xmath4 be a free subgroup of @xmath3 .",
    "then by @xcite and @xcite , the ( infinite - volume ) hyperbolic manifold @xmath7 is _ topologically tame _ , i.e. homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold",
    ". then work of canary ( @xcite ) implies that @xmath4 is geometrically finite i.e. if @xmath8 is the convex hull of the limit set of @xmath4 , then @xmath9 is compact .",
    "the next step , based on the ideas of @xcite , is to give a polyhedral structure to @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the tesselation of @xmath1 by copies of @xmath0 , and let @xmath11 be the _ tiling hull _ of @xmath4 this is the union of all the tiles in @xmath10 which meet @xmath8 .",

    "thus @xmath12 is a handlebody @xmath13 .",
    "the tesselation @xmath10 induces a tesselation of @xmath14 .",
    "since all dihedral angles of @xmath0 are @xmath15 , then every pair of adjacent faces in @xmath14 will meet at an angle of either @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "however , if two faces meet at an angle of @xmath16 , then we actually consider them as part of a single face .",
    "thus , every face in @xmath14 can be decomposed as a union @xmath17 , where each @xmath18 is congruent to a face of the original polyhedron @xmath0 . along each @xmath18",
    ", we may attach to @xmath13 a copy of @xmath0 , to obtain a handlebody with convex boundary containing @xmath13 , called the * expansion of w along f*. more generally , we define an * expansion * of @xmath13 to be a handlebody @xmath19 , obtained from @xmath13 by a finite sequence of such operations .",

    "a complication is that @xmath119 may not be an embedded circle in @xmath48 , and thus there may be pairs of adjacent faces in @xmath48 which meet @xmath116 non - consecutively . in this case",
