    "let us now focus on strategies to extract @xmath0 from pairs of @xmath3-meson decays , which are related to each other through the @xmath2-spin flavor symmetry of strong interactions . in order to deal with non - leptonic",
    "@xmath3 decays , @xmath2-spin offers an important tool , and first approaches to extract ckm phases were already pointed out in 1993 @xcite .",
    "however , the great power of the @xmath2-spin symmtery to determine weak phases and hadronic parameters was noticed just recently in the strategies proposed in @xcite@xcite .",
    "since these methods involve also decays of @xmath34-mesons , @xmath3 experiments at hadron colliders are required to implement them in practice . at tevatron - ii , we will have first access to the corresponding modes and interesting results are expected @xcite . in the era of btev and the lhc , the @xmath2-spin strategies can then be fully exploited @xcite , as emphasized by stone at this symposium . in the following discussion , we shall focus on two particularly promising approaches , using the @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xcite and @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xcite systems .",
    "looking at the corresponding feynman diagrams , we observe that @xmath36 is obtained from @xmath40 by interchanging all down and strange quarks .",
    "the structure of the corresponding decay amplitudes is given as follows @xcite : @xmath41\\ ] ] @xmath42,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 are cp - conserving strong amplitudes , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 measure , sloppily speaking , ratios of penguin to tree amplitudes . using these general parametrizations ,",
    "we obtain the following expressions for the direct and mixing - induced cp asymmetries : @xmath47 @xmath48 consequently , we have four observables , depending on six `` unknowns '' .",
    "however , since @xmath40 and @xmath36 are related to each other by interchanging all down and strange quarks , the @xmath2-spin flavor symmetry of strong interactions implies @xmath49 using this relation , the four observables ( [ asym-1])([asym-4 ] ) depend on the four quantities @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath0 , which can hence be determined .",
    "it should be emphasized that no dynamical assumptions about rescattering processes have to be made in this approach , which is an important conceptual advantage in comparison with the @xmath1 strategies discussed above .",
    "the theoretical accuracy is hence only limited by @xmath2-spin - breaking effects .",
    "theoretical considerations allow us to gain confidence into ( [ u - spin - rel ] ) , which does not receive @xmath2-spin - breaking corrections in factorization @xcite . moreover , there are general relations between observables of @xmath2-spin - related decays , allowing experimental insights into @xmath2-spin breaking @xcite",
    ".    the @xmath2-spin arguments can be minimized , if we employ the @xmath53@xmath54 mixing phase @xmath52 as an input , which can be determined straightforwardly through @xmath55 .",
    "the observables @xmath56 and @xmath57 allow us then to eliminate the strong phase @xmath51 and to determine @xmath50 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "analogously , @xmath58 and @xmath59 allow us to eliminate the strong phase @xmath60 and to determine @xmath61 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding contours in the @xmath0@xmath50 and @xmath0@xmath61 planes can be fixed in a _ theoretically clean _ way .",
    "using now the @xmath2-spin relation @xmath62 , these contours allow the determination both of the ckm angle @xmath0 and of the hadronic quantities @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath60 ; for a detailed illustration , see @xcite .",
    "this approach is very promising for tevatron - ii and the lhc era , where experimental accuracies for @xmath0 of @xmath63 @xcite and @xmath64 @xcite may be achieved , respectively .",
    "it should be emphasized that not only @xmath0 , but also the hadronic parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath60 are of particular interest , as they can be compared with theoretical predictions , thereby allowing valuable insights into hadron dynamics . for strategies to probe @xmath0 and constrain hadronic penguin parameters using a variant of the @xmath35 , @xmath36 approach , where the latter decay is replaced through @xmath37 , the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "another interesting pair of decays , which are related to each other by interchanging all down and strange quarks , is the @xmath66 , @xmath67 system @xcite . in the strict @xmath2-spin limit",
    ", the corresponding decay amplitudes can be parametrized as follows : @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes a cp - conserving complex amplitude , @xmath71 , @xmath72 is a real parameter , and @xmath73 a cp - conserving strong phase . at first sight , it appears as if @xmath0 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 could be determined from the ratio of the cp - averaged rates and the two cp asymmetries provided by these modes .. ] however , because of the relation @xmath74 latexmath:[\\[\\label{ru - rel } = -\\left[|a(b^0_s\\to\\pi^+k^-)|^2-|a(\\overline{b^0_s}\\to\\pi^-k^+ )    that the three parameters @xmath0 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 can not be determined . to this end",
    ", the overall normalization @xmath70 has to be fixed , requiring a further input . assuming that rescattering processes play a minor rle and that color - suppressed ew penguins can be neglected as well",
    ", the isospin symmetry implies @xmath76 in order to extract @xmath0 and the hadronic parameters , it is useful to introduce observables @xmath77 and @xmath78 by replacing @xmath37 through @xmath38 in ( [ mixed - obs ] ) . using ( [ par1 ] ) , ( [ par2 ] ) and ( [ par3 ] ) , we then obtain @xmath79 @xmath80 together with the parametrization for @xmath81 as sketched in ( [ obs - par ] ) , these observables allow the determination of all relevant parameters .",
    "the extraction of @xmath0 and @xmath73 is analogous to the `` mixed '' @xmath37 , @xmath82 approach discussed above .",
    "however , now the advantage is that the @xmath2-spin counterparts @xmath38 of @xmath37 allow us to determine also the parameter @xmath72 without using arguments related to factorization @xcite : @xmath83}.\\ ] ] on the other hand , we still have to make dynamical assumptions concerning rescattering and color - suppressed ew penguin effects .",
    "the theoretical accuracy is further limited by @xmath84-breaking effects .",
    "an interesting consistency check is provided by the relation @xmath85 , which is due to ( [ ru - rel ] ) .",
    "a variant of this approach using the ckm angle @xmath39 as an additional input was proposed in @xcite .",
    "there are many strategies to determine @xmath0 , suffering unfortunately in several cases from experimental problems .",
    "the approaches discussed above , employing penguin processes , are on the other hand very promising from a practical point of view and exhibit further interesting features . as a by - product , they also allow us to determine strong phases and other hadronic parameters , allowing comparisons with theoretical predictions . moreover , these strategies are sensitive probes for the physics lying beyond the standard model , which may lead to discrepancies in the extraction of @xmath0 or the hadronic quantities .",
    "let us hope that signals for new physics will actually emerge this way .",
