    "in this paper we reexamine and analyze the phenomenon of `` bistability '' that occurs in chemical models of dark interstellar clouds .",
    "bistability was first discussed by le bourlot et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who found that multiple solutions to the chemical rate - equations sometimes appear in numerical computations of the gas - phase abundances of atomic and molecular species for steady - state dark cloud conditions .",
    "when bistability occurs , three sets , rather than a single unique set , of chemical abundances are predicted for identical input cloud parameters such as the total gas density , the cosmic - ray ( or x - ray ) ionization rate , and the gas - phase supply of heavy elements . under such circumstances , the solution that is converged to in a numerical simulation , and perhaps , the actual steady - state of a real physical system , depend on the initial conditions and history of the gas .",
    "the subject of bistability begins with pineau des forets et al .",
    "( 1992 ) who studied how the computed chemical states of dark clouds depend on the gas density and ionization rate .",
    "they found , as would be expected , that for a given ionization rate the fractional ionization of the gas decreases roughly as the square - root of the gas density .",
    "however , they also found that the ionization fraction and associated chemical composition changes abruptly , or quasi - discontinuously , at a specific critical transition density . below the critical density",
    "the clouds are in what pineau des forets et al",
    ".  referred to as a `` high - ionization '' phase ( hip ) , characterized by high abundances of atomic ions . for densities greater than the critical density",
    "the clouds are in a `` low - ionization '' phase ( lip ) , with high abundances of molecular ions .",
    "pineau des forets et al .  also identified a chemical instability that , they argued , is responsible for the abrupt transition that they encountered in their calculations .",
    "bistability was subsequently discovered by le bourlot et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who found that instead of a phase change at a specific critical density , the lip and hip `` branches '' can sometimes overlap for a narrow range of densities .",
    "a third ( unstable ) branch also appears , intermediate between the lip and hip solutions .",
    "further investigations have explored the effects of the assumed gas phase elemental abundances , ionization rates , gas temperatures , chemical reaction rate coefficients , and gas - grain interactions , on the existence and character of the multiple solutions ( le bourlot et al .",
    "1995ab ; shalabiea & greenberg 1995 ; lee et al .",
    "1998 ; pineau des forets & roueff 2000 ; viti et al .  2001 ; charnley & markwick 2003 ) .",
    "these studies have shown that bistability is indeed related to the transition from the hip to lip ( or vice versa ) , and that it is sensitive to quantities such as the gas - phase heavy - element abundances ( le bourlot et al .  1995 ; viti et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the adopted chemical network ( lee et al .",
    "1998 ) , including specifically the dissociative recombination rate coefficient of h@xmath0 ( pineau des forets & roueff 2000 ) . in this paper",
    "we explain why the hip and lip can overlap , and we identify the chemical mechanisms that allow the possibility of multiple solutions .",
    "we will show that bistability can be simply understood and analyzed using just a handful of reactions . in a nutshell , when bistability occurs atomic ions ( usually s@xmath1 ions ) are the dominant positive charge carriers for both hip and lip conditions .",
    "two modes of neutralization are then available to the gas . in the hip ,",
    "neutralization proceeds by slow radiative recombination . in the lip ,",
    "neutralization occurs by rapid dissociative recombination , via the formation of intermediate molecular ions in reactions with o@xmath2 molecules ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) .",
    "bistability occurs when a low o@xmath2 abundance in the hip can be maintained up to maximal gas densities that are _ greater _ than the minimal densities above which a large o@xmath2 density is maintained in the lip .",
    "we will show by means of a simple analysis why this is possible .",
    "the explanation involves a chemical instability , of a type first introduced by pineau des forets et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , but not given sufficient attention in subsequent studies .",
    "bistability may be of primarily theoretical interest since , as we will discuss , it is a purely gas - phase chemical effect . if realistic gas - dust neutralization processes are included , the multiple solutions are damped or eliminated entirely ( cf .  shalabiea & greenberg 1995 ) .",
    "we will illustrate this by considering the effect of grain - assisted ion - electron recombination ( weingartner & draine 2001 ) on the chemistry .",
    "nevertheless , because bistability has been the subject of considerable discussion in the literature , we feel that a fresh analysis of how , why , and when it occurs is warranted .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we present results of an illustrative numerical computation in which bistability occurs . in ",
    "3 we discuss the key chemical instability that drives the steady - state solutions to either the lip or hip . in ",
    "4 we derive simple analytic formulae that show how the range of gas densities and ionization rates for which the gas becomes bistable depends on the elemental abundances and several important chemical rate coefficients . in ",
    "5 we analyze the sensitivity of bistability to the h@xmath0 dissociative recombination rate coefficient . in  6 we explain why gas - grain neutralization processes damp and eliminate bistability .",
    "we summarize in  7 .",
    "we first illustrate the phenomenon of bistability in a detailed numerical computation . for this purpose",
    "we calculate the steady - state atomic and molecular abundances for dark cloud conditions , as functions of the gas density .",
    "we include only gas - phase formation and destruction processes , except for molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath2 ) , which we assume is formed on grain surfaces .",
    "the chemistry is driven by cosmic - ray impact ionization of hydrogen and helium , followed by standard sequences of ion - molecule , charge - exchange , and neutral - neutral reactions .",
    "the chemistry is also mediated by radiative and dissociative recombination , and cosmic - ray induced photoionization and photodissociation .",
    "the effects of externally incident fuv photons are excluded .",
    "we use the boger & sternberg ( 2005 ) network for a system consisting of 70 atomic and molecular carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , sulfur , and silicon bearing species ( see also sternberg & dalgarno 1995 ) .",
    "we neglect all other heavy elements .",
    "our set of 868 reactions and rate coefficients is based mainly on the umist99 compilation ( le teuff et al .",
    "2000 ) with some modifications and alterations . as in boger & sternberg ( 2005 )",
    "we adopt @xmath4 @xmath5 gas - phase abundances , with c / h=@xmath6 ( cardelli et al .",
    "1993 ) , n / h=@xmath7 ( meyer et al .",
    "1997 ) , o / h=@xmath8 ( meyer et al .",
    "1998 ) , si / h=@xmath9 ( cardelli et al .  1994 ) , and s / h=@xmath10 ( lepp et al .  1988 ) .",
    "we set he / h=0.1 . we assume a constant gas temperature of @xmath11 k for the entire range of gas densities that we consider .    in our calculations",
    "we solve the equations of chemical equilibrium @xmath12 for the densities @xmath13 of all species @xmath14 in our set . in these equations ,",
    "@xmath15 are the temperature - dependent rate coefficients ( @xmath16 s@xmath17 ) for chemical reactions between species @xmath18 and @xmath19 that lead to the production of @xmath14 , and @xmath20 are the cosmic - ray destruction rates ( s@xmath17 ) of species @xmath18 with products @xmath14 .",
    "the parameters @xmath20 include impact ionizations of hydrogen and helium by the cosmic - ray protons and secondary electrons , as well as photo - destruction of heavy atomic and molecular species by induced uv photons .",
    "the @xmath20 are all proportional to @xmath21 s@xmath17 , the cosmic - ray ionization rate of molecular hydrogen ( sternberg et al .  1987 ; gredel et al .",
    "1989 )    the densities @xmath13 must also satisfy the supplementary equations of element and charge conservation .",
    "these are , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of atoms of element @xmath24 contained in species @xmath14 , @xmath25 is the total abundance of element @xmath24 relative to the total density @xmath26 of hydrogen nuclei , and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the charge of species @xmath14 . in our computations ,",
    "the negative charge is carried entirely by free electrons .",
    "h@xmath2 molecules are formed primarily on dust grains and are destroyed by cosmic - ray ionization . a separate equation",
    "may then be written for the h / h@xmath2 balance , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the atomic and molecular hydrogen densities respectively , and @xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath17 is the h@xmath2 grain surface formation rate coefficient ( biham et al .  2002 ; vidali et al .",
    "2004 ) .    for fixed gas temperature and gas - phase elemental abundances , the density fractions @xmath34",
    "as determined by equations  ( [ ceqns])-([heqn ] ) depend on the single parameter @xmath35 ( e.g. , lepp & dalgarno 1996 ; lee et al .",
    "1998 ) , as is readily seen by dividing each term in these equations by @xmath36 .",
    "we consider a range of parameters for which almost all of the hydrogen is in the form of h@xmath2 , so that @xmath37 .",
    "we therefore present our results as functions of the ratio @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we solve equations  ( [ ceqns])-([heqn ] ) numerically via newton - raphson ( nr ) iteration . in our procedure",
    "we vary the density along the hip and lip branches and use the solutions from the previous density step as the `` initial guess '' for the nr iteration in the next density step . in the bistability region",
    "we carry out repeated nr iterations with random initial guesses , so that all three branches are found .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the densities @xmath40 , and density fractions @xmath41 , as functions of @xmath38 ranging from 10@xmath42 to 10@xmath43 @xmath39 , for several species of interest .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) display our results for electrons , c@xmath1 , s@xmath1 , h@xmath0 , and a sum over all molecular ions . panels ( c ) and",
    "( d ) display our results for the neutral species c , o , co and o@xmath2 .",
    "several important features are apparent in figure 1 , some of which have been noted in previous discussions .    for our assumed elemental abundances and gas temperature , a high - ionization phase ( hip ) is present for densities less",
    "than @xmath44 @xmath39 , and a low - ionization phase ( lip ) is present for densities greater than @xmath45 @xmath39 .",
    "the hip and lip overlap , and the gas is bistable , between these minimal and maximal densities .",
    "the hip and lip solutions are connected by a third branch that we refer to here as the mix solution .    in the hip ,",
    "the positive charge is carried entirely by atomic ions .",
    "s@xmath1 is the dominant ion down to @xmath46 @xmath39 . at lower densities c@xmath1",
    "takes over , and for @xmath47 @xmath39 , h@xmath1 dominates . in the lip , the molecular ions hco@xmath1 and h@xmath48o@xmath1 are the primary positive charge carriers for densities greater than @xmath49 @xmath39",
    "however , s@xmath1 dominates at lower densities in the lip .",
    "most importantly , in our calculation s@xmath1 is the primary positive charge carrier in _ both _ the hip and lip for the densities at which bistability occurs .    the fractional ionization increases from a minimum value @xmath50 as the density decreases from @xmath51 in the hip . in the lip ,",
    "the fractional ionization decreases from a maximum value of @xmath52 as the density increases from @xmath53 .",
    "the fractional ionization drops by a factor of @xmath54 in moving from the hip to lip in the bistability region .    the free atomic carbon density and the c / co abundance ratio is large in the hip . the ratio @xmath55 in the bistability region , and exceeds unity for @xmath56 @xmath39 . in the lip the c density and the c / co ratio are small . in our computation the c / co ratio drops by a factor @xmath57 in moving from the hip to the lip .",
    "the drop in c / co is associated with an _ increase _ in the o@xmath2 density and the o@xmath2/co ratio .",
    "it is very significant that the c and o@xmath2 densities vary in opposite directions in the transition between the hip and lip .    on the mix branch",
    "the fractional ionization , and the c / co and o@xmath2/co ratios , are intermediate between the hip and lip .",
    "s@xmath1 is also the dominant positive ion on the mix branch .",
    "however , the fractional ionization increases with gas density along the mix .    in table  1 we list the densities of selected atomic and molecular species for the three hip , lip , and mix solutions , for @xmath58 @xmath39 and @xmath59 s@xmath17 .",
    "we also list the hip / lip density ratios for these values of @xmath60 and @xmath4 .",
    "atomic ions , e.g. , s@xmath1 , si@xmath1 , and c@xmath1 , are abundant in the hip solution . in the lip solution , molecular ions such as h@xmath0 , hco@xmath1 , and h@xmath48o@xmath1 are abundant , leading to more oh , h@xmath2o , and o@xmath2 than in the hip . the oxygen",
    "bearing molecules , no , so , and sio , are enhanced by the large o@xmath2 density that is maintained in the lip .",
    "carbon bearing molecules , such as cn and hcn , are enhanced in the hip because of the large atomic carbon density in this phase ( see also boger & sternberg 2005 ) .",
    "cs is produced by reactions of so ( enhanced in the lip ) with c ( enhanced in the hip ) so that the cs density changes by only a factor of @xmath61 in moving from the lip and hip .",
    "figure 1 shows that as the gas density @xmath60 is increased along the sequence of hip solutions an abrupt jump to the lip branch occurs when @xmath60 rises above @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , as @xmath60 is decreased along the lip , a jump to the hip occurs when @xmath60 falls below @xmath53 .",
    "as we now discuss , these jumps are signatures of a simple chemical instability involving electrons , s@xmath1 and h@xmath0 ions , c atoms , and o@xmath2 molecules .",
    "the instability can be understood by considering the gas - phase formation and destruction sequences for these species , for gas densities where the bistable solutions occur .",
    "we first discuss the hip and lip , and we then consider the mix .",
    "we begin with h@xmath0 . in both the hip and lip ,",
    "this ion is formed by cosmic - ray ionization of h@xmath2 followed by proton transfer , @xmath62 @xmath63 in the hip , the electron fraction is large , and dissociative recombination @xmath64 @xmath65 dominates the removal of the h@xmath0 . however , in the lip the electron fraction is small , and the h@xmath0 is removed by @xmath66 for a gas temperature of 50 k , dissociative recombination dominates the destruction of h@xmath0 when @xmath67 .    in both",
    "the hip and lip , the production of o@xmath2 is initiated by proton transfer @xmath68 which is followed by abstraction @xmath69 @xmath70 dissociative recombination @xmath71 @xmath72 and the neutral - neutral reaction @xmath73 however , the o@xmath2 is destroyed in different ways in the two phases . in the hip ,",
    "the density of free atomic carbon is large , and the o@xmath2 is removed by @xmath74 in the lip , the c density is small , and the o@xmath2 is removed much less efficiently in reactions with less abundant atoms and atomic ions .",
    "an upper limit on the o@xmath2 density in the lip is set by cosmic - ray induced photodissociation @xmath75 reaction ( r13 ) is inefficient , and the o@xmath2 density becomes large in the lip .    in the hip ,",
    "c@xmath1 is produced by cosmic - ray driven helium impact ionization of co , @xmath76 @xmath77 this is then followed by rapid charge transfer @xmath78 which leads to the production of s@xmath1 and c. the s@xmath1 ions are removed by radiative recombination , @xmath79 the c atoms are removed by cosmic - ray induced photoionization @xmath80 because cosmic - ray photoionization is inefficient , a large c density is maintained in the hip .    in the lip ,",
    "c@xmath1 is also produced by helium impact ionization ( [ r14 ] and [ r15 ] ) . however , because the o@xmath2 density is large in the lip , the c@xmath1 ions are rapidly neutralized by the sequence @xmath81 @xmath82 and the c@xmath1 density becomes small . in the lip , charge transfer between c@xmath1 and s ( [ r16 ] ) contributes negligibly to the removal of c@xmath1 , or to the formation of s@xmath1 .",
    "the main source of s@xmath1 in the lip is cosmic - ray induced photoionization @xmath83 crucially , o@xmath2 also dominates the neutralization of s@xmath1 in the lip , via @xmath84 @xmath85 for a gas temperature of 50 k , neutralization of s@xmath1 by o@xmath2 dominates over radiative recombination when @xmath86 .",
    "finally , the c atoms formed by ( r20 ) are also removed by reactions with o@xmath2 ( [ r12 ] ) , and the c density becomes small in the lip .    for the gas densities of interest ,",
    "most of the gas - phase sulfur is present as s and s@xmath1 in both the hip and lip , with only a small fraction bound in molecules .",
    "s@xmath1 is the primary positive charge carrier in both the hip and lip .",
    "however , in the hip s@xmath1 is removed by radiative recombination , whereas in the lip by reactions with o@xmath2 . in the hip ,",
    "h@xmath0 is removed by dissociative recombination , c is removed by cosmic - ray induced photoionization , and o@xmath2 is removed by c. in the lip , h@xmath0 is removed by co , c is removed by o@xmath2 , and o@xmath2 is limited by cosmic - ray induced photodissociation .",
    "the abundance ratio c / o@xmath2 is large in the hip , and is small in the lip .",
    "now consider a gas where s@xmath1 is again the dominant charge carrier , but which differs from the hip or lip in that dissociative recombination contributes significantly to the removal of h@xmath0 ( as in the hip ) , while on the other hand s@xmath1 is neutralized by o@xmath2 ( as in the lip ) .",
    "assume also that o@xmath2 is produced by the sequence ( r6)-(r11 ) , and that the o@xmath2 destruction rate increases if the o@xmath2 density decreases .",
    "this is possible when reaction ( r12 ) between o@xmath2 and c is the dominant destruction mechanism for both species , so that @xmath87 increases if @xmath88 decreases . for these conditions",
    "a chemical instability can occur , as we demonstrate with the following perturbation analysis .",
    "consider a possible solution to the steady - state rate equations . with the above assumptions this requires @xmath89 .",
    "now consider a perturbative increase in the ionization fraction @xmath90 , carried out at fixed gas density @xmath60 .",
    "this will reduce h@xmath0 by a factor that depends on the relative efficiencies of dissociative recombination versus reaction with co in removing the h@xmath0 .",
    "the o@xmath2 is removed by c ( via [ r12 ] ) , so for a given c density the reduction in h@xmath0 will lead to an equal reduction in o@xmath2 ( since o@xmath2 is formed by [ r6]-[r11 ] ) .",
    "however , the decrease in o@xmath2 will lead to an increase in c , since the c is removed by o@xmath2 ( again via [ r12 ] ) .",
    "this reduces o@xmath2 further still .",
    "the s@xmath1 density then increases by a factor equal to the total reduction in o@xmath2 ( since s@xmath1 is removed by o@xmath2 ) .",
    "finally , to close the loop , @xmath91 must then be set equal to the new value of @xmath92 , since by assumption s@xmath1 carries the positive charge . however , if the increase in s@xmath1 is larger than the initial increase in the electron density the cycle `` runs away '' in a positive feedback loop .",
    "this h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 cycle is illustrated schematically in figure 2 .",
    "it is clear that the cycle can also lead to a run - away decrease in the electron density , in response to a perturbative decrease in @xmath91 . for increasing electron densities , o@xmath2 decreases and c increases .",
    "for decreasing electron densities , o@xmath2 increases and c decreases .",
    "the instability shuts off for sufficiently large or small fractional ionizations . for large @xmath93 , radiative recombination , rather than removal by o@xmath2 ,",
    "becomes the dominant s@xmath1 neutralization process . for small",
    "@xmath93 , reaction with co replaces dissociative recombination as the h@xmath0 removal mechanism .",
    "either way , the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 instability cycle shuts off , and the gas becomes chemically stable .    in the hip ,",
    "dissociative recombination dominates the destruction of h@xmath0 , but s@xmath1 is removed by radiative recombination . in the lip ,",
    "s@xmath1 is removed by o@xmath2 , but h@xmath0 is removed by co. crucially therefore , the h@xmath0o@xmath2s@xmath1 cycle is inoperative on the hip and lip branches , and these solutions are chemically stable .",
    "we now identify the maximum possible density for the hip , @xmath51 , as the point at which o@xmath2 , _ as formed and destroyed in the hip _ , becomes sufficiently abundant to begin removing the s@xmath1 .",
    "when this occurs , the h@xmath0o@xmath2s@xmath1 cycle turns on ( since h@xmath0 is still being removed by electrons ) and a stable hip is no longer possible . as the density is increased above @xmath51 the instability induces a sharp drop in @xmath91 . as the electron density drops in the run - away loop , o@xmath2 increases and c decreases .",
    "the system is finally stabilized when the electron density becomes sufficiently small for reactions with co to begin dominating the removal of h@xmath0 .",
    "the h@xmath0o@xmath2s@xmath1 cycle then turns off , and a stable solution on the lip is reached .",
    "similarly , we identify the minimum possible density for the lip , @xmath53 , as the point at which the fractional ionization , _ as determined for the lip _ , becomes sufficiently large for dissociative recombination to begin dominating the removal of h@xmath0 .",
    "when this occurs , the h@xmath0o@xmath2s@xmath1 cycle turns on , ( since s@xmath1 is still removed by o@xmath2 ) and a stable lip is no longer possible .",
    "as the density is decreased below @xmath53 the instability induces a sharp rise in @xmath91 . as the electron density increases , o@xmath2 decreases and c increases .",
    "the electron density rises until it becomes sufficiently large ( and the o@xmath2 density sufficiently small ) for radiative recombination to dominate the neutralization of s@xmath1 .",
    "the instability then shuts off , and a stable solution on the hip is reached .",
    "the mix branch can now also be understood .",
    "it represents the locus of equilibrium solutions , with varying @xmath60 , for which the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 cycle _ is _ operative , but for which any change in electron density is precisely matched by a corresponding change in the s@xmath1 density . for these solutions , dissociative recombination and reactions with co both",
    "contribute to the removal of h@xmath0 , and s@xmath1 is removed by o@xmath2 . furthermore ,",
    "reaction ( r12 ) is the dominant destruction mechanism , for both o@xmath2 and c. as the electron fraction increases along the mix , the o@xmath2 formation rate decreases , but by a factor that is smaller than the increase in electron density .",
    "the density of c atoms ( which remove the o@xmath2 ) increases such that the total increase in o@xmath2 , and the resulting increase in s@xmath1 , exactly matches the increase in electron density .",
    "figure 3 summarizes the key characteristics of the hip , lip , and mix branches , as described above .",
    "the triangular symbols indicate the three `` legs '' of the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 cycle illustrated in figure 2 . in the hip , removal of s@xmath1 by o@xmath2",
    "is inoperative so this leg is labeled as `` off '' . in the lip ,",
    "dissociative recombination of h@xmath0 is inoperative so this leg is `` off '' for this phase . for the mix , which shares properties of both the hip and lip , all three legs of the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 cycle operate , and are `` on '' . in figure 3",
    "we also indicate the dominant removal reactions for s@xmath1 , h@xmath0 , o@xmath2 , and c , for each of the three branches .",
    "the hip and lip as originally defined by pineau des forets et al .  (",
    "1992 ) , were distinguished by whether h@xmath0 is removed by dissociative recombination ( hip ) , or by reactions with co ( lip ) .. however , they did not consider how the instability is quenched in each phase . ] here we have identified a second , and crucial , distinction . in the hip , atomic ions , are removed by ( slow ) radiative recombination . in the lip",
    "the atomic ions are effectively removed by rapid dissociative recombination , via the formation of intermediate molecular ions , as in the sequence ( r22 ) and ( r23 ) .    in our discussion",
    "it is s@xmath1 that plays the crucial role of positive charge carrier in both the hip and lip .",
    "the reason why simultaneous hip , lip , and mix solutions are possible now emerges .",
    "bistability occurs when radiative recombination is able to dominate the removal of s@xmath1 in the hip up to maximal gas densities that are _ greater _ than the minimal densities down to which reactions with co dominate the removal of h@xmath0 in the lip .",
    "alternatively , bistability occurs when it is possible for a low hip o@xmath2 abundance to be maintained up to maximal gas densities that are greater than the minimal gas densities down to which a large lip o@xmath2 density can be maintained .",
    "this is our key result .",
    "when this occurs , there exists a range of densities for which the s@xmath1 ions are either removed slowly via radiative recombination ( hip , low o@xmath2 ) or rapidly via dissociative recombination ( lip , high o@xmath2 ) .",
    "the simultaneous solutions are separated by the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 instability cycle , which drives the o@xmath2 density to either small ( hip ) or large ( lip ) values",
    ".    the critical densities @xmath53 and @xmath51 , as defined above , depend on a variety of factors including the elemental abundances , and several specific chemical rate coefficients . in ",
    "4 we derive simple analytic expressions for these critical densities .",
    "we determine , analytically , when it is possible for @xmath51 to exceed @xmath53 , which is our condition for bistability , and we determine the range of gas densities for which bistability occurs .",
    "for stable hip conditions the electron density must be sufficiently large for dissociative recombination to dominate the removal of h@xmath0 , and the o@xmath2 density must be sufficiently small for radiative recombination to dominate the removal of s@xmath1 .",
    "we now show analytically that consistent solutions that satisfy these hip conditions are possible provided the density is less than a critical _ maximum _ gas density .",
    "we first derive an expression for the o@xmath2 density in the low density limit of the hip .",
    "we show that in this limit the o@xmath2 density is small , and radiative recombination dominates the removal of s@xmath1 .",
    "we then show that our low density expression for o@xmath2 remains consistent only up to a maximal gas density .",
    "we identify this as the maximum possible density for hip solutions .",
    "we then verify that dissociative recombination dominates the removal of h@xmath0 , a necessary condition for the hip , for all densities below this critical density .    in the hip ,",
    "o@xmath2 is produced by the sequence ( r6)-(r11 ) , and is removed by reaction ( r12 ) with atomic carbon .",
    "this gives , @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 @xmath16 s@xmath17 are the rate coefficients ( at 50 k ) of ( r6 ) and ( r12 ) , and @xmath98 is the fraction ( jensen et al .",

    "the key result of the above analysis is that for our standard parameters @xmath152 , as given by equation  ( [ hcond2 ] ) , is _ greater _ than @xmath148 , as given by equation  ( [ le6 ] ) .",
    "the gas is therefore bistable between the maximal hip density and minimum lip density .",
    "the mix branch must therefore `` switch back '' from the maximal hip density to the minimal lip density .",
    "the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 instability cycle drives the o@xmath2 density to either very low values in the hip where a large ionization fraction is maintained by slow radiative recombination , or it drives the o@xmath2 density to very large values in the lip where a low ionization fraction is maintained by rapid dissociative recombination .",
    "our analytic estimates for the two critical densities are in good agreement with the numerical results displayed in figure 1 .",
    "equations  ( [ hcond ] ) and ( [ le5 ] ) show that the critical densities depend on several parameters , including the gas - phase elemental abundances of carbon , oxygen , sulfur and helium , and on several specific chemical rate coefficients , including @xmath153 , the dissociative recombination rate coefficient of h@xmath0 .",
    "varying any of these parameters alters the range of densities for which bistability occurs , or eliminates it entirely if @xmath152 becomes smaller than @xmath148 .    a dependence of bistability on @xmath153 , a rate coefficient that has been the subject of much investigation and controversy ( see e.g. , mccall et al .",
    "2004 ) , was found in numerical computations by pineau des forets & roueff ( 2000 ) . in their calculations",
    "( see their fig .",
    "4 ) they set @xmath154 @xmath39 , and varied @xmath153 from @xmath155 to @xmath156 @xmath16 s@xmath17 .",
    "they found that the gas is in the lip or hip , for low or high values of @xmath153 , and that it is bistable for intermediate h@xmath0 recombination efficiencies .",
    "our analysis provides an explanation for this behavior .    in figure 4",
    "we plot @xmath93 versus @xmath38 , for five values of @xmath153 , ranging from 0.2 to 5 times our standard 50 k value of @xmath157 @xmath16 s@xmath17 . in these numerical computations , all other parameters , including all rate coefficients and gas - phase elemental abundances , are the same as in the computations we presented in  2 .",
    "figure 4 shows that for small @xmath153 bistability is suppressed , and that as @xmath153 is increased the gas becomes bistable for an increasing range of densities",
    ". for @xmath38 held fixed at , say , @xmath158 @xmath39 , the gas is in the lip or hip for low or high @xmath153 , and is bistable for intermediate values .",
    "this is the same behavior found by pineau des forets & roueff ( 2000 ) .",
    "these results can be readily understood as follows . as the dissociative recombination rate coefficient of h@xmath0 is increased , less o@xmath2 is produced by the sequence ( r6)-(r11 ) at any give density .",
    "an hip can therefore be maintained to higher densities before o@xmath2 becomes significant in removing s@xmath1 .",
    "an increased h@xmath0 recombination efficiency also implies that electrons become competitive with co in removing h@xmath0 at larger densities in the lip .",
    "quantitatively , equation  ( [ hcond ] ) shows that @xmath51 , the density above which o@xmath2 begins removing s@xmath1 , is proportional to @xmath159 .",
    "however , @xmath53 , the density below which electrons begin removing the h@xmath0 , varies only linearly with @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , as @xmath153 is reduced , @xmath152 falls _ below _",
    "@xmath53 , and bistability disappears .",
    "as @xmath153 is increased , @xmath51 grows more rapidly , and eventually exceeds , @xmath53 , and the gas becomes bistable for an increasing range of densities .",
    "for example , if @xmath153 is increased by a factor of 5 relative to our standard value , figure 4 shows that @xmath51 increases by about a factor of 25 , and @xmath53 increases by about a factor of 5 . this is consistent with expressions  ( [ hcond ] ) and ( [ le5 ] ) .",
    "a similar scaling analysis may be carried out for the other parameters that control @xmath160 and @xmath123 .",
    "for example , if the oxygen abundance is reduced our analysis shows that the regime of bistability should move to higher values of @xmath100 , as found numerically by viti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( see their figures 5 and 7 ) . for a lower oxygen abundance @xmath160 is increased because the hip can be maintained to a higher density before o@xmath2 becomes abundant enough to remove the atomic ions .",
    "the reduced o@xmath2 density leads to a higher electron density in the lip , so @xmath160 is increased as well .",
    "our numerical and analytic results show how the onset of the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 instability cycle depends on the o@xmath2 and electron densities as determined by the elemental abundances and by the h@xmath0 dissociative recombination rate coefficient .",
    "however , figure 4 reveals an additional interesting feature . for @xmath153",
    "equal to 0.2 times our standard value the gas again becomes marginally bistable at @xmath161 @xmath39 .",
    "at such low densities the dominant atomic ion in the hip is c@xmath1 rather than s@xmath1 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the instability , and the transition from hip to lip , is therefore modified by the addition of an identical h@xmath0-o@xmath2-c@xmath1 cycle , with reactions ( r19 ) and ( r20 ) operating to neutralize the c@xmath1 .",
    "the behavior in this numerical example is a bit more complicated because s@xmath1 is still the dominant ion in the lip at the transition density .",
    "we note that at such low densities realistic clouds would likely become `` diffuse '' and optically thin to external far - ultraviolet radiation , with a resulting reduction in o@xmath2 and further modifications to the chemistry .",
    "we do not consider such effects here .",
    "we have shown that bistability arises in purely gas - phase models , consistent with previous findings . when the hip and lip solutions `` overlap ''",
    ", neutralization of atomic ions ( s@xmath1 in our models ) proceeds by either slow radiative recombination in the hip , or via the formation of intermediate molecular ions ( @xmath3 ) followed by rapid dissociative recombination in the lip .",
    "the two solutions are separated by a chemical instability , which we have identified in our models as the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 cycle .",
    "our analysis suggests that bistability will be damped , or eliminated entirely , if additional neutralization processes are included that interrupt the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 cycle .",
    "we demonstrate this by considering how the single process of `` grain assisted recombination '' of atomic ions affects the chemistry . in this process ,",
    "atomic ions recombine via electron transfer from grains to the ions during collisions with the grains ( draine & sutin 1987 ; weingartner & draine 2001 ) . the grain assisted recombination rate may be expressed as @xmath162 , where @xmath26 is the total density of hydrogen nuclei . for any ion",
    ", @xmath163 is an effective rate coefficient that depends on the dust - to - gas ratio , grain size distribution , grain charge , and gas temperature .",
    "this process dominates radiative recombination when @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the radiative recombination rate coefficient . for @xmath166 @xmath16 s@xmath17 ( appropriate for s@xmath1 ) , and a fractional ionization @xmath167 , as occurs for densities near @xmath51 in our computation ( see fig .  1 ) , grain assisted recombination dominates radiative recombination for @xmath168 @xmath16 s@xmath17 .",
    "this is well below the maximum values of @xmath169 @xmath16 s@xmath17 found by weingartner & draine , so this process is potentially relevant in determining the ionization balance .",
    "furthermore , grain assisted recombination will interfere with the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 cycle and render it inoperative when @xmath170 , where as previously defined , @xmath171 is the fraction of oxygen bound in o@xmath2 , and @xmath119 @xmath16 s@xmath17 is the rate coefficient of reaction ( r22 ) . for @xmath139 and @xmath172 ,",
    "the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 instability cycle is quenched when @xmath173 @xmath16 s@xmath17 .",
    "bistability and the sharp transition from hip to lip should then disappear .",
    "we illustrate this in figure 5 , where we plot @xmath93 versus @xmath38 , for @xmath163 ranging from zero ( as in figures 1 and 4 ) to @xmath174 @xmath16 s@xmath17 , for all atomic ions .",
    "all other parameters are as in the calculation in  2 . as @xmath163",
    "is increased the diminished electron density leads to more h@xmath0 and o@xmath2 in the hip , so that @xmath51 is reduced .",
    "similarly , the onset of dissociative recombination in the lip occurs at lower densities , and @xmath53 is reduced .",
    "thus , at first the bistability region shifts to lower densities as @xmath163 is increased .",
    "however , as estimated above , when @xmath163 exceeds @xmath175 @xmath16 s@xmath17 bistability is eliminated entirely , because the h@xmath0-o@xmath2-s@xmath1 ( and h@xmath0-o@xmath2-c@xmath1 ) cycles are fully quenched , and neutralization occurs entirely by grain recombination .",
    "these results strongly suggest that for realistic clouds , in which gas - grain neutralization is a likely important process , bistability will not occur .",
    "the precise value of @xmath163 in dark clouds may be variable , as the grain population can be modified by coagulation ( draine 1985 ; flower et al .",
    "2005 ) and other processes . however , even with the removal of all grains with sizes below @xmath176  , the rate coefficient @xmath177 @xmath16 s@xmath17 ( e.g.  mckee 1989 ) , which is sufficiently large to suppress bistability .",
    "we thus confirm and explain the results of shalabiea and greenberg ( 1995 ) , who found that bistability is eliminated when gas - grain processes , including grain assisted recombination , are incorporated in the numerical computations .",
    "the non - linearity of equations ( 1)-(4 ) is a mathematical prerequisite for bistability and the appearance of multiple solutions ( le bourlot et al .  1993 , 1995 ;",
    "lee et al .",
    "1998 ; pineau des forets & roueff 2000 ; charnley & markwick 2003 ) .",
    "however , the purpose of our paper has been to identify and analyze the chemical mechanisms underlying the bistability phenomenon .",
    "we have shown that a simple chemical instability , involving atomic ions ( typically s@xmath1 ) , o@xmath2 molecules , and h@xmath0 ions , allows multiple solutions to appear near the transition points from low - density high - ionization ( hip ) to high - density low - ionization ( lip ) conditions in the gas - phase chemistry .",
    "the instability drives the o@xmath2 density to either small ( hip ) or large ( lip ) values .",
    "bistability occurs when a low o@xmath2 abundance in the hip can be maintained up to maximal densities that are greater than the minimal densities above which a large o@xmath2 density is maintained in the lip .",
    "two modes of neutralization are then simultaneously available to the gas .",
    "the slow ( hip ) mode is radiative recombination ( usually @xmath178 ) .",
    "the fast ( lip ) mode is formation of molecular ions followed by dissociative recombination ( usually @xmath3 ; @xmath179 ) .",
    "we have derived simple analytic scaling relations for the range of gas densities and ionization rates for which bistability occurs .",
    "our formulae show how the bistable range depends on the assumed gas - phase abundances , and several reaction rate - coefficients , including the dissociative recombination rate coefficient of h@xmath0 .",
    "bistability is eliminated when the two modes of gas - phase neutralization are superseded by gas - grain processes such as grain assisted recombination of the atomic ions .",
    "this likely happens for the range of electron and o@xmath2 densities where bistability typically occurs in purely gas - phase models .",
    "we conclude that the bistability phenomenon probably does not occur in realistic dusty interstellar clouds , although it remains of theoretical interest .",
