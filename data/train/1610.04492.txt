    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems are among the best playgrounds where non - equilibrium phenomena and interaction effects can be studied .",
    "many peculiar behaviors have been predicted to occur in 1d  @xcite , with a richer and more complicated physics compared to analogous case in higher dimension . for instances ,",
    "it is well - known that fermionic particles in 2 or 3 dimensions are well - described by the fermi liquid theory , where interactions do not play a dramatic role  @xcite .",
    "indeed , for these systems one can re - formulate the problem in terms of quasiparticles with parameters renormalized by interactions , such as the effective mass or the particle velocity . on the contrary , in 1d the fermi liquid paradigm fails and interactions crucially influence the whole dynamics of the system itself  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the great advances in nanotechnology , experimental realizations of 1d and quasi-1d systems recently have lead to the verification of different predictions and to the observation of intriguing phenomena .",
    "few examples of condensed matter systems which exhibit typical 1d behavior include edge states in topological materials  @xcite , carbon nanotubes  @xcite , semiconducting nanowires  @xcite , atomic chains  @xcite and bechgaard salts  @xcite .    among all the peculiar features of interacting 1d gapless fermion systems ,",
    "charge  @xcite and energy fractionalization  @xcite are certainly some of the most interesting . here , when a particle is injected into an interacting 1d system it splits up and originates two collective excitations that propagate in opposite directions , each one carrying a fraction of the particle original charge and energy .",
    "the partitioning of these quantities between the two excitations depends on the strength of the interparticle interaction and , in the case of the energy , also on the injection process  @xcite . in the context of fractionalization",
    "phenomena many theoretical predictions have been put forward  @xcite and recently charge fractionalization has been experimentally tested in different 1d interacting systems  @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , the low energy sector of 1d interacting systems belong to the universality class of the integrable luttinger liquid ( ll )  @xcite .",
    "ll theory is extremely powerful for the study of standard equilibrium properties , and also allows for the investigation of out - of - equilibrium physics @xcite of interacting systems .",
    "this latter topic was recently addressed and investigated especially in view of the experimental progresses in ultracold atomic gases  @xcite which has renewed the interest in this field  @xcite . indeed , the possibility of tuning with high precision and in a time - dependent fashion some of the system parameters , such as the interaction strength  @xcite , allowed to probe their real time evolution and to perform transport experiments  @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting question about isolated interacting quantum many body systems far from equilibrium is whether they thermalize or not .",
    "it has been shown that this is indeed the case for the vast majority of quantum systems  @xcite . however ,",
    "if a system is integrable  @xcite , as it is for the ll , it can relax to a stationary non - thermal state , retaining strong memory of its initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "recent works have indeed confirmed how the equilibrium spectral and transport properties of a ll  @xcite are strongly modified by an interaction quantum quench  @xcite . in this respect",
    "a still open question is how fractionalization will be influenced by quench and how strong are the memory effects of the initial pre - quenched state .",
    "this issue will be addressed in the present paper .",
    "we consider a 1d system subjected to a sudden quench of the interparticle interaction and non - local tunnel coupled to a parallel voltage biased 1d non - interacting probe .",
    "we demonstrate that in the long time limit the system settles to a steady state in which the ratio of the charges that travel along the two directions depends only on the post - quench hamiltonian without any memory of the initial state .",
    "this is a quite remarkable behavior , since the majority of the observables of a quenched integrable model retain a strong memory of the initial state  @xcite .",
    "the reason for that can be traced back to the absence of charge transfer between the ll channels . on the contrary",
    ", the energy partitioning is strongly affected by the quench with a finite memory of the initial state and sharp differences from a non - quenched case .",
    "we explain this behavior as induced by the profound changes in the spectral function of a quenched ll  @xcite .",
    "indeed , due to the highly excited nature of the steady state , the spectral function possesses non vanishing tails which allow for energy flow in energy - momentum regions not accessible in the non - quenched case . as a consequence , the differential energy current in one of two directions can be negative and the energy partitioning ratio can thus be greater than one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we develop the model for the two voltage biased parallel 1d fermion systems , describing the interaction quench and the non - local tunneling .",

    "we consider two parallel 1d fermion systems : one which play the role of the external probe treated as a non - interacting ll ( hereafter referred as the probe ) and the other representing the interacting ll ( called the system ) which undergoes a quantum quench of the interparticle interactions . a schematic view of the setup is depicted in fig .",

    "non - local tunneling between probe and system is switched on immediately after the quench . to this end , the probe is subjected to a bias voltage energy @xmath21 , measured with respect to the fermi level of the interacting system . since our goal is to study fractionalization phenomena it is necessary to break the inversion symmetry injecting only either @xmath22- or @xmath23-moving particles ( see the shaded red region in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved , for instance , via momentum resolved tunneling @xcite , a technique that played a crucial role in the first experimental detection of charge fractionalization in 1d quantum wires @xcite .",
    "it consists in using an external magnetic field @xmath24 , perpendicular to the tunneling plane , that effectively shifts in momentum the dispersion relation of the probe by an amount @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the distance between the probe and the system ) .",
    "such a shift can be tuned so that the tunneling can occur only between , say , the probe @xmath23-channel and the system @xmath22-channel . in that case",
    "the non - local tunneling hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath27 the tunneling amplitude function @xmath28 models the extended tunneling region with width @xmath29 , while the heaviside function takes into account the switching on of the tunneling at @xmath30 .",
    "since the probe is also subjected to a bias voltage @xmath31 it is worth to consider two parameters : @xmath32 , the momentum of a probe @xmath23-particle at the fermi level and @xmath21 , the energy of the most energetic particle in the probe .",

    "when a finite width @xmath29 is concerned , the heisenberg principle implies an uncertainty on the tunneling particles momentum and the chiral differential charge current becomes then proportional to the convolution of the system spectral function with a weight function , centered around @xmath73 .",

    "indeed , the interparticle interaction can only create fluctuations of particle density but the total number of particles on each channel is conserved . since in our scheme particles are injected solely on the @xmath22 channel , only this one will actively contribute to the net charge current , no matter how the injection is carried out or how the system is prepared before the injection . as long as only one channel",
    "is concerned , it has been shown @xcite that fractionalization phenomena are completely controlled by the equation of motion of its field operators .",

    "nevertheless the transfer of energy between the two channels is allowed .",
