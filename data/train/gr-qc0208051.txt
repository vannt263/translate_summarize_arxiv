    "after decades of planning and development , an array of large - scale laser interferometric gravitational - wave detectors ( interferometers for short ) , consisting of the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) , virgo , geo and tama @xcite , is gradually becoming operative , targeted at gravitational waves in the high - frequency band ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) .",
    "michelson - type laser interferometry is used in these detectors to monitor gravitational - wave - induced changes in the separations of mirror - endowed test masses .",
    "more specifically , a laser beam is split in two by a 50/50 beamsplitter , and the two beams are sent into the two arms ( which may contain fabry - perot cavities ) and then brought back together and interfered , yielding a signal that senses the difference of the two arm lengths . although it is plausible that gravitational waves will be detected , for the first time in history , by these initial interferometers , a significant upgrade of them must probably be made before a rich program of observational gravitational - wave astrophysics can be carried out @xcite . in the planned upgrade of the ligo interferometers ( _ advanced ligo _ , tentatively scheduled to begin operations in @xmath6 @xcite ) , the michelson topology will still be used , as also is probably the case for advanced ligo s international counterparts , for example the japanese lcgt @xcite .",
    "an alternative to the michelson topology , the sagnac topology , originally invented in 1913 @xcite for rotation sensing , can also be used for gravitational - wave detection @xcite . in a sagnac interferometer , as in a michelson , a laser beam is split in two , but each of the two beams travels successively through both arms , though in the opposite order ( in opposite directions ) .",
    "when the two beams are finally recombined , a signal sensitive to the _ time - dependent part _ of the arm - length difference is obtained .    until now , there has been little motivation to switch from the more mature michelson topology to the sagnac topology , because : ( i ) the technical advantages provided by the sagnac topology have not been able to overcome its disadvantages @xcite , and ( ii ) the _ shot - noise limited _ sensitivities of ideal sagnac interferometers have not exhibited any interesting features @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a sustained research effort is still being made on the sagnac topology , aimed at third generation gravitational - wave detectors ( beyond advanced ligo ) .",
    "in particular , an all - reflective optical system suitable for the sagnac is being developed @xcite , with the promise of being able to cope with the very high laser powers that may be needed in the third generation .    in this paper , a theoretical study of the idealized noise performance of sagnac - based interferometers at high laser powers is carried out .",
    "it is shown that , by contrast with the previously studied low - power regime , the ( ideal ) sagnac interferometer might be significantly better at high powers than its ideal michelson counterparts , and thus is an attractive candidate for third - generation interferometric gravitational - wave detectors , e.g. , ligo - iii and euro @xcite .    in advanced gravitational - wave interferometers ,",
    "the laser power is increased to lower the shot noise . however , at these higher light powers , the photons in the arms exert stronger random forces on the test masses , thereby inducing stronger _ radiation - pressure noise_. at high enough laser powers ( above about 850 kw in advanced ligo ) , the radiation - pressure noise can become larger than the shot noise and dominate a significant part of the noise spectrum ( usually at all frequencies below the noise - curve minimum ) . as was first pointed out by braginsky in the 1960s @xcite ,",
    "a balance between the two noises gives rise to a standard quantum limit ( sql ) .",
    "as was later realized , again by braginsky @xcite , the sql can be circumvented by clever designs , which he named quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) schemes .",
    "the advanced ligo interferometers were originally planned to operate near or at the sql @xcite , but it was later shown by buonanno and chen that they can actually beat the sql by a moderate amount over a modest frequency band , due to a change in interferometer dynamics @xcite induced by detuned signal - recycling @xcite .",
    "generations beyond advanced ligo , however , will have to beat the sql by significant amounts over a broad frequency band ; i.e. , they must be _",
    "strongly qnd_. currently existing schemes for strongly qnd interferometers with michelson topology include : ( i ) the use of two additional kilometer - scale optical filters to perform frequency - dependent homodyne detection @xcite at the output of a conventional michelson interferometer , as invented and analyzed by kimble , levin , matsko , thorne and vyatchanin ( klmtv ) @xcite .",
    "( reference @xcite can be used as a general starting point for the quantum - mechanical analysis of qnd gravitational - wave interferometers . )",
    "( ii ) the speed - meter interferometer , originally invented by braginsky and khalili @xcite , developed by braginsky , khalili , gorodetsky and thorne @xcite , and later incorporated into the michelson topology by purdue and chen @xcite . in its michelson form ,",
    "the speed meter uses at least one additional kilometer - scale optical cavity to measure the relative momentum of the free test masses over a broad frequency band .",
    "the speed meter is motivated , theoretically , by the fact that the momentum of a free test mass is a _ qnd observable _",
    "@xcite i.e. , it can be measured continuously to arbitrary accuracy without being limited by the sql .",
    "practically , qnd schemes based on a michelson speed meter can exhibit broadband qnd performances using only one additional kilometer - scale cavity , by contrast with the two additional cavities needed for qnd schemes based on a conventional michelson interferometer ( a _ position meter _ ) .",
    "speed - meter - based qnd schemes are also less susceptible to optical losses than those based on michelson position meters ( sec .  v of @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly , so far as we are aware nobody has previously noticed that , because the sagnac interferometer is sensitive only to the _ time - dependent part _ of the arm - length difference , it is automatically a speed meter . moreover , as we shall see in this paper , with the help of _ signal - recycling _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , by putting one additional mirror at its dark output port , a sagnac interferometer can be optimized to have a comparable performance to a michelson speed meter , _ without the need for any additional kilometer - scale cavities_. in particular , a signal - recycled sagnac interferometer with ring cavities in its arms has exactly the same performance as the michelson speed meters of ref .",
    "@xcite , aside from ( presumably minor ) differences due to optical losses .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we derive the input - output relation of signal - recycled sagnac interferometers , with either optical delay lines or ring - shaped fabry - perot cavities in the arms , showing that they are indeed measuring the relative speed of test masses . in sec .",

    "iv , we discuss some technical issues that deserve further investigation .",

    "two variants of sagnac interferometers are shown in figs .  [ sagnac_dl ] and [ sagnac_fp ] , which uses optical delay lines or ring - shaped fabry - perot cavities in the arms .",
    "[ the idea of using optical delay lines and ring cavities are due to drever , proposed in similar designs .",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . ] in both variants , the carrier light enters the interferometer from the left port ( also called the `` bright port '' ) of the beamsplitter ( bs ) .",
    "the light gets split in two and travels into the two arms in opposite orders ; we denote by r the beam that enters the north ( n ) arm first and the east ( e ) arm second , and by l that which enters e first and n second .",
    "suppose the mirrors are all held fixed at their equilibrium positions , so that the two arms are exactly symmetric ; then the carrier r and l beams , upon arriving again at the beamsplitter , will combine in such a way that no lights exits to the port below the beamsplitter ( the `` dark port '' ) .",
    "similarly , any vacuum fluctuations that enter the interferometer at the bright port along with the carrier light will also be suppressed in the dark - port output .",
    "only vacuum fluctuations that entered the interferometer from the dark port can leave the interferometer through the dark port . as a result ,",
    "the dark port is decoupled from the bright port , as in a michelson interferometer .",
    "this fact is crucial to the suppression of laser noise in the dark - port output .",
    "when the end mirrors of the two arms are allowed to move , they phase modulate the carrier light , generating sideband fields . only antisymmetric",
    ", non - static changes in the arm lengths can contribute to the dark - port output ; this is a result of the cancellation at the beamsplitter , and the fact that the two beams pass through the two arms in the opposite order .",
    "a more detailed but still rough exploration of this point reveals the sagnac s role as a speed - meter interferometer :    denoting by @xmath7 the ( average ) storage time of light in the arms and by @xmath8 the time - dependent displacements of the end mirrors , we have for the phase gained by the r and l beams after traveling from the bright entry port through the two arms to the dark exit port : @xmath9 the amplitude of the dark - port output is proportional to the phase difference of the two beams at the beamsplitter : @xmath10\\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\left [ x_{\\mathrm{e}}(t)-x_{\\mathrm{e}}(t+\\tau    _ { \\mathrm{arm}})\\right ] \\ ,",
    ".   \\label{dphir_dphil}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a consequence , the sagnac interferometer is _ not _ sensitive to any time - independent displacement of the test masses . by expanding eq .",
    "( [ dphir_dphil ] ) in powers of @xmath11 , we see that , at frequencies much smaller than @xmath12 , the _ speed _ of the test - mass motion is measured , and at higher frequencies , a mixture of the speed and its time derivatives is measured  as also is the case in other speed meters @xcite .      as a foundation for evaluating the performances of sagnac interferometers in the high - power regime",
    ", we shall now derive their quantum mechanical _ input - output relations _ ",
    "i.e. , we shall derive equations for the quantum mechanical dark - port output field @xmath13 in terms of the input ( vacuum ) fields @xmath14 at the dark port and @xmath15 at the bright port ( which in the end does not appear in @xmath13 ) , and the gravitational - wave field @xmath16 . in figs .",

    ", we shall ignore the existence of the signal - recycling mirror ( srm ) ; and throughout we shall ignore the power - recycling mirror ( prm ) since ( as for michelson topologies ) it merely serves to provide a larger input power at the beamsplitter and has no other significance for the interferometer s quantum noise .    in this paper , we shall use the caves - schumaker two - photon formalism @xcite ( briefly introduced in sec .",

    "@xmath22 are slowly varying fields called the cosine ( or amplitude ) and sine ( or phase ) quadratures .",

    "we shall now comment on three technical issues that might affect significantly the performances of sagnac speed - meter interferometers :    _ optical losses .",
    "_ so far in this paper , we have regarded all interferometers as ideal ; most importantly , we have ignored optical losses . as has been shown by several studies of the michelson case @xcite , optical losses",
    "can sometimes be the limiting factor on the sensitivity of a qnd interferometer .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , michelson speed meters are _ less susceptible to _ optical losses than michelson position meters ( even though the losses may be enhanced by the larger number of optical surfaces on which to scatter or absorb , and by the fact that the coupling constant @xmath30 remains finite as @xmath31 rather than growing to infinity ) .",
    "it is plausible that this feature will be retained , at least for optical losses associated with the individual optical elements , and with the readout scheme , but rigorous calculations are yet to be carried out .",
    "moreover , the losses due to the use of diffractive optics and polarization techniques in some sagnac configurations @xcite deserve serious study .    _ high power through the beam splitter .",
    "_ as we saw at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : spectraldensity ] , for fp sagnac interferometers , in order to optimize the shape of the noise curve , the required values of the power transmissivity of the itm can become as large as @xmath32 , which may require optical powers at the level of tens of kilowatts through the beamsplitter ( even when squeezed vacuum is injected into the dark port ) ; this may pose a problem for implementation . in michelson speed meters ,",
    "a resonant - side - band - extraction technique can be used to greatly reduce the power through the beamsplitter without affecting the interferometer s performance , but it is not clear whether an analogous trick exists for sagnac interferometers .    _ susceptibility to mirror tilt and imperfections .",
    "_ in the low - laser - power limit , the sagnac interferometer is known to be more susceptible to mirror tilting than are michelson interferometers , but less susceptible to geometric imperfections of mirrors @xcite .",
    "a study of these susceptibilities needs to be carried out in the context of high laser power , in order to see whether they pose any serious difficulty in the implementation of sagnac speed meters .",
    "in this paper , a quantum - mechanical study of idealized sagnac interferometers , including radiation - pressure effects , has been carried out . as was already known ,",
    "sagnac interferometers are sensitive only to the time varying part of the antisymmetric mode of mirror displacement .",
    "it was a short and trivial step , in this paper , to demonstrate that this means a sagnac interferometer measures the test masses relative speed or momentum and therefore is a speed meter with qnd capabilities .",
    "detailed computations revealed that , as for other speed meters , a broad - band qnd performance can be obtained , when frequency - independent homodyne detection is performed at the dark port .",
    "signal recycling can be employed to further optimize the noise spectrum so it is comparable to that of a michelson speed meter ( or exactly the same , for sagnac configurations with ring cavities in the arms ) ; and , by contrast with the michelson , this can be achieved without the need for any additional kilometer - scale fp cavity . [ in the case of frequency - dependent homodyne detection with the aid of two kilometer - scale filter cavities , the sagnac speed meter still needs one less optical cavity than its michelson counterpart . ] if further technical issues , including those related to optical losses ( sec .",
    "[ sec : furtherissues ] ) , can be resolved , the sagnac optical topology will be a strong candidate for third - generation gravitational - wave interferometers , such as ligo - iii and euro .",

    "<S> according to quantum measurement theory , `` _ speed meters _ ''  devices that measure the momentum , or speed , of free test masses  are immune to the standard quantum limit ( sql ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a sagnac - interferometer gravitational - wave detector is a speed meter and therefore in principle it can beat the sql by large amounts over a wide band of frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown , further , that , when one ignores optical losses , a signal - recycled sagnac interferometer with fabry - perot arm cavities has precisely the same performance , for the same circulating light power , as the michelson speed - meter interferometer recently invented and studied by p. purdue and the author . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of optical losses is not studied , but it is plausible that they be fairly unimportant for the sagnac , as for other speed meters . with squeezed vacuum ( squeeze factor @xmath0 ) injected into its dark port , </S>",
    "<S> the recycled sagnac can beat the sql by a factor @xmath1 over the frequency band @xmath2 using the same circulating power @xmath3 kw as is used by the ( quantum limited ) second - generation advanced ligo interferometers  if other noise sources are made sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that the sagnac optical configuration , with signal recycling and squeezed - vacuum injection , is an attractive candidate for third - generation interferometric gravitational - wave detectors ( ligo - iii and euro ) . </S>"
