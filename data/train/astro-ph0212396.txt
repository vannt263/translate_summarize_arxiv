    "the kinematics of the cold interstellar medium ( ism ) largely determines the future star formation and black hole growth in galaxies . in the circumnuclear region of most galaxies , corresponding to approximately the central kiloparsec , both pressure and gravitational forces can dominate these kinematics . in the absence of velocity information ,",
    "observations of dust lanes in absorption from visible and near - infrared ( nir ) images can provide a snapshot of the cold ism .    before the advent of _ hst _ ,",
    "high spatial resolution observations of dust in the circumnuclear region were only possible for relatively nearby galaxies , including our own @xcite , andromeda @xcite , and several other relatively nearby galaxies where circumnuclear dust is apparent on photographic plates in , for example , the carnegie atlas of galaxies @xcite .",
    "large single - band _ hst_programs have vastly expanded the number of galaxies with high spatial resolution observations ( resolutions less than 50 parsecs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations have revealed a wealth of detail in the circumnuclear structure of spiral galaxies and show that this nuclear structure is frequently quite different from the large scale morphology in any given galaxy .",
    "multiband observations of smaller samples of active galaxies clearly show that much of this circumnuclear structure is due to nuclear dust @xcite , although mostly material that is only a factor of a few higher density than the ambient ism @xcite .",
    "one of the most common dust features found in the circumnuclear region are nuclear dust spirals , which exhibit a wide range of intrinsic shapes .",
    "these include symmetric , two - arm spirals , one - arm spirals , and chaotic , multiarm spirals @xcite . a number of theoretical models exist that can give rise to coherent dust structures in the circumnuclear region , although in all cases some differential rotation is required to form the spiral structure .",
    "galaxies with strong , large scale bars form shock fronts along the leading edges of their bar @xcite and hydrodynamic simulations show that this inflowing material can form symmetric and two - arm or `` grand design '' spiral structure in the circumnuclear region @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently modeled the circumnuclear region of barred galaxies and found grand design nuclear spirals similar to those found by @xcite .",
    "while the nuclear spirals in @xcite only corresponded to weak perturbations , the gas velocity field of the spirals in @xcite had a large negative divergence , characteristic of strong shocks and similar to the shocks in the large - scale bar .",
    "significant inflow is likely to be associated with these spirals shocks , as shown by @xcite .",
    "more chaotic , or `` flocculent '' spirals can form in the circumnuclear region from pressure forces , or acoustic turbulence , in the ism @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the liners",
    "ngc4450 and ngc4736 by @xcite show that the azimuthal fourier transform spectra have a power law slope of -5/3 , characteristic of turbulence .",
    "these structures therefore appear to be formed by the same turbulent processes that create structure in the ism of galaxies at larger radii , but have been sheared by the presence of some differential rotation in the circumnuclear region and given a spiral appearance .",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations of the central ism also naturally produce a filamentary , spiral structure in surface density with pressure and gravitational forces @xcite .",
    "both these analytic and numerical studies suggest some inflow can occur due to turbulence alone .",
    "the nuclear dust spirals on these small scales ( they are generally a kiloparsec or less in length ) are distinct from their host galaxy spiral arms both spatially and in composition .",
    "nuclear spirals rarely extend out of the region dominated by the central bulge .",
    "observations of seyfert galaxies over many kiloparsecs show that while the grand design nuclear spirals appear to connect to the dust lanes along the large scale bar , most types of nuclear spirals do not connect to the large - scale spiral arms @xcite .",
    "these nuclear spirals also appear to only be enhancements in the dust surface density and not sufficiently overdense to be self - gravitating .",
    "only a small number of nuclear dust spirals have associated star formation ( e.g.ngc4321 , coma d15 : * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and nir observations do not show enhancements in the stellar surface density associated with the spirals @xcite .",
    "in addition , density waves tend to get stronger with increasing radius , whereas the nuclear spirals get weaker with increasing radius @xcite",
    ".    one of the primary motivations for most of these multiband observations was to study the circumnuclear environment of active galaxies in order to determine the processes that removed angular momentum from host galaxy material and fueled the central , supermassive black hole .",
    "hst_programs have provided strong evidence that all galaxies with a spheroid component have a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "this result has added new urgency to the question of how nuclear activity is fueled and why it is not currently fueled in all galaxies .",
    "nuclear spiral structure was proposed as a mechanism for fueling nuclear activity because it was both discovered in nearly all of the observations of active galaxies and that these structures could be formed by shocks @xcite .",
    "both bar - driven inflow and acoustic turbulence are theoretically viable mechanisms for the removal of angular momentum . in the case of inflow from large - scale bars ,",
    "the gas and dust loses essentially all of its angular momentum in the shock front at the leading edge of the bar . for acoustic turbulence ,",
    "the shocks in the ism caused by the turbulence could dissipate sufficient energy and angular momentum to lead to significant inflow @xcite .",
    "however , aside from the absence of kinematic data to demonstrate that inflow does occur , the selective investigation of active galaxies resulted in relatively few comparable observations of inactive galaxies .",
    "such observations are needed to determine if there is an excess of nuclear spiral structure , or other morphological features , in active galaxies over inactive galaxies of similar hubble types and luminosities .",
    "we have obtained _ hst_observations of a significantly larger sample of both active and inactive galaxies to perform this analysis and present the data and a morphological study of each of the galaxies in our sample . in a future paper @xcite",
    "we compare the circumnuclear environment of active and inactive galaxies for a well - matched subsample of these data , as well as discuss some interesting results on differences in the circumnuclear environments of barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "this galaxy sample was initially formed from the 91 seyfert galaxies that meet the revised shapely - ames ( rsa ) catalog magnitude requirement ( @xmath0 mag ) discussed by @xcite , minus those with @xmath1 and axial ratios @xmath2 , to insure the circumnuclear region could be studied at high spatial resolution with minimal inclination effects .",
    "the resulting sample comprises 67 seyfert galaxies , of which eight were gto targets .",
    "inactive galaxies with approximately the same velocity , inclination , hubble type , and luminosity were selected for each of 67 these seyferts .",
    "additional seyfert and non - seyfert galaxies of particular interest were then added to increase the sample of nearby galaxies . from this input catalog , 104 galaxies",
    "were observed as part of a nicmos snapshot program ( sn 7330 ; pi mulchaey ) .",
    "the galaxies observed with nicmos , minus those that already had unsaturated , wfpc2 f606w images from _ hst _ , then formed the input catalog of 88 galaxies for our wfpc2 snapshot program ( sn 8597 ; pi regan ) and 76 of these galaxies have been observed to date . to these galaxies",
    "we have added the nicmos observations of seyfert 2s ( go 7867 ; pi pogge ) from the cfa survey @xcite , in order to place them on a common classification scheme , and the rsa seyferts observed by nicmos gto programs , to create the final sample of 123 galaxies .",
    "table  [ tbl : basic ] lists the most common name(s ) for each galaxy and provides the _ hst_program that obtained the visible and nir images .",
    "the wfpc2 filter used for the visible - wavelength image is also listed ; the f160w filter ( hereafter @xmath3 ) was used for all of the nicmos observations .",
    "comparison of the circumnuclear dust properties of active and inactive galaxies requires reliable classifications .",
    "while the active galaxies are clearly active , the question of just what constitutes a inactive galaxy is much more dependent on the quality of previous observations .",
    "the inactive galaxies in this sample are generally bright and nearby , and therefore have been observed with sufficient sensitivity to detect at least a bright active nucleus , but genuine nuclear activity at very low levels usually can not be ruled out .",
    "for example , three of the 35 inactive rsa galaxies observed for the original nicmos snapshot program were later reclassified as seyfert  2 galaxies by the palomar survey @xcite and a comparable number were classified as liners . in table",
    "[ tbl : morph ] we list the type of nuclear activity present in each galaxy from table  [ tbl : basic ] , as well as references to the original work and most recent classification . for the inactive galaxies , we list references to any surveys that could have detected some level of nuclear activity if it were present .",
    "the question of whether or not a galaxy possesses a large - scale bar presents a problem comparable to the presence of nuclear activity .",
    "while all of the galaxies have been observed as part of the rc3 @xcite and have visible - wavelength observations , many galaxies that do not appear to have bars based on visible - wavelength data do have them when studied in the nir @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of the galaxies in this sample were observed in the nir , although there are nevertheless many apparently unbarred galaxies that do not have nir observations .",
    "the classification of these unbarred galaxies are not as reliable as the unbarred galaxies that do have nir observations .",
    "nevertheless , aside from a few striking exceptions such as ngc1068 @xcite , very few galaxies that show no evidence for a bar at visible wavelengths are strongly barred in the nir @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl : morph ] lists the bar classification for each galaxy , along with a flag to represent the quality of the bar classification .",
    "table  [ tbl : morph ] also lists the distance to each of these galaxies used to compute the projected spatial scale of the images shown in figure  [ fig : cmaps ] . as the catalog of nearby galaxies",
    "@xcite was the single largest source for these distances , we have adopted a hubble constant of @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 . for galaxies that did not have a previously published distance , we have used the relationship derived by @xcite to estimate the distance .",
    "the majority of the visible - wavelength images were obtained as part of the snapshot program sn 8597 .",
    "these consist of two exposures of length 140s and 400s obtained through the f606w filter and with the galaxy centered on the pc chip .",
    "the image pairs were processed through the standard calibration pipeline and then combined with an xvista script as described in @xcite .",
    "the remaining visible wavelength images were obtained from the _ hst_archive and constitute either image pairs similar to those obtained for sn 8597 , or single exposures .",
    "these later observations required additional steps to remove the cosmic ray contamination and to process these images we have developed a new algorithm , which is described in the next section .",
    "the nir images were all processed by the standard nicmos pipeline developed at stsci .",
    "many of the earliest images were obtained while this pipeline was still under development and were later recalibrated with new procedures and reference files as they became available .",
    "the basic details of the nicmos reduction steps are described in @xcite for sn 7330 and @xcite for go 7867 .",
    "the galaxies not observed by either of these programs were obtained from the stsci archive and processed by the best reference and calibration files .",
    "none of the images were processed with calnicb , instead the final shift and add step and any cosmic ray cleaning was performed in iraf .",
    "techniques for the removal of cosmic rays fall into two general families .",
    "the first relies on multiple images of the same field , such as those obtained as part of our snapshot program . here",
    "cosmic rays are identified as an anomalously large intensity increase in a given pixel and can be rejected when the images are combined .",
    "the second method is for the case where only a single image is available . in this latter case",
    "cosmic rays are detected by the deviation of a given pixel by a certain threshold over the variation in the neighboring pixels and the value of this pixel is then replaced with some value calculated from the neighboring pixels .    for the galaxies from the _ hst_archive with only single observations , the majority of which were from snapshot program sn 5479 @xcite , we developed a new method of cosmic ray detection and removal based on detailed knowledge of the _ hst_point spread function ( psf ) and the fact that cosmic rays produce image artifacts which are usually sharper than the psf . to identify cosmic rays ,",
    "the original image is convolved with a psf model generated with the tinytim software @xcite and then this convolved image is divided back into the original image to form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the original image , @xmath8 is the psf , and @xmath9 is the convolution operator .",
    "pixels values greater than two in this divided image were empirically determined to nearly always correspond to bad pixels and these pixels were flagged and replaced by the average pixel value in the immediate vicinity in the original image .",
    "cosmic rays were typically found to contaminate neighboring pixels within approximately one pixel of those identified by this technique .",
    "we therefore smoothed an initial mask of the flagged pixels with a 3x3 boxcar kernel to generate a final mask of all contaminated pixels .",
    "each of these masked pixels was then replaced by the mean value of a 5x5 pixel box centered on the pixel , minus any other masked pixels within this region .",
    "this technique is based on the `` structure map '' concept detailed in @xcite , where a structure map is defined as : @xmath10\\otimes p^{t}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the structure map and @xmath12 is the transpose of the model psf , @xmath13 .",
    "the cosmic ray detection image differs from the structure map as the original image is simply divided by a convolved version of itself , and not then convolved again by the transpose of the psf .",
    "the image used for cosmic ray detection is similar to the second `` correction image '' formed in typical implementations of richardson - lucy ( r - l ) image restoration @xcite , although formally this latter image is @xmath14 . in practice ,",
    "image anomalies such as cosmic rays or saturated stars needed to be removed from the galaxies we studied in @xcite as the structure maps overemphasized these features to the point of obliterating neighboring physical structures of interest . in several instances we also cleaned images by hand or used the method of laplacian edge detection described by @xcite .",
    "the visible - wavelength images were calibrated with the standard calibration header keywords to approximately correspond to either ground - based @xmath15 or @xmath7 band , depending on the filter .",
    "all of the nir observations were obtained through the nicmos f160w filter , which is close to , but slightly broader than , a ground - based @xmath3 filter .",
    "the majority of these observations were obtained with nicmos camera 2 , although 22 observations were obtained with nicmos camera 1 .",
    "these nir observations were converted to @xmath3 magnitudes per square arcsecond using the standard nicmos photometric calibration .",
    "the visible and nir images , hereafter referred to as the @xmath15 and @xmath3 images , respectively , were then rebinned onto a common plate scale of @xmath16 per pixel and differenced to form @xmath17 color maps .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmaps ] shows these @xmath15 , @xmath3 , and @xmath17 images for all 123 galaxies .    the angular resolution difference of @xmath18 between the diffraction limit of _ hst_at the effective wavelengths of the f606w and f160w filters results in very different spatial resolutions in the two filters .",
    "this effect is particularly striking for the active galaxies with bright nuclei , such as ngc1068 or ngc4151 .",
    "the nuclei of these galaxies have striking red rings due to the prominence and larger radius of the airy diffraction rings in the nir data .",
    "one way to mitigate the effects of these artifacts is to convolve the respective images by the psf of the other in order to achieve a common angular resolution .",
    "however , the large mismatch in angular resolution between these frames effectively means that the excellent angular resolution of the @xmath15 observations is significantly degraded .",
    "in fact , while the angular resolution mismatch is quite striking in the active nuclei , in general it does not effect the interpretation of dust morphology in the circumnuclear environment .",
    "this is because the @xmath15 data are approximately a factor of five more sensitive to dust extinction ( for a standard milky way reddening law ) than the @xmath3 data and thus nearly all of the information on the dust morphology is contained in the @xmath15 frames and the @xmath3 data mostly provides a measure of the true stellar light distribution in the absence of dust . to prove this point , and confirm that the angular resolution mismatch between @xmath15 and @xmath3 does not introduce spurious dust features which could impact on our analysis , we have created a series of color maps with the @xmath15 and @xmath3 data convolved to the same angular resolution and compared these convolved color maps with the unconvolved frames .",
    "a subset of these comparison frames are shown in figure  [ fig : convtest ] for galaxies with particularly striking circumnuclear dust morphology . while these panels clearly show that the psf - matching process smooths out dust features , it neither erases them completely nor leads to spurious features .",
    "the wide variety of different circumnuclear dust structures in figure  [ fig : cmaps ] illustrates striking similarities and differences to the larger scale morphology of galaxies .",
    "most of these color maps show spiral lanes of dust and many of these nuclear spirals bear close resemblance to the grand design and multiarm spirals of varying pitch angle common to large scale spiral structure many kiloparsecs in extent .",
    "however , while such dust spirals appear to be quite common , many galaxies with well - ordered large scale structure have very chaotic circumnuclear environments , e.g.ngc3351 . in addition , while circumnuclear spiral structure of some form is present in most these galaxies , it is much less frequently as ordered and symmetric as large scale spiral structure .",
    "perhaps most importantly , the dust structures in the circumnuclear region only rarely appears to have any associated star formation , whereas only a small fraction of all large scale spirals ( e.g.ngc7377 and ic5063 ) are purely defined by dust , rather than star formation .",
    "the nir images also do not show evidence for any enhancement in the stellar surface density associated with the spirals , whereas large - scale , grand design @xcite and flocculent @xcite spirals show some enhancements in the nir .",
    "because of these physical and morphological differences , particularly in the spiral structure , we have decided to develop a separate classification system for circumnuclear dust , rather than attempt to continue @xcite s extension of the hubble classification scheme to smaller scales .    while the morphological differences between circumnuclear dust spirals and large scale , predominantly stellar spirals merit a different classification system , their similarities lead naturally to a parallel approach .",
    "@xcite , in their introduction to the carnegie atlas of galaxies , describe how the philosophy behind the hubble system is an amalgam of the extreme empiricist and rationalist approaches to classification in its synthesis of observational data with physical insight and intuition .",
    "we endeavored to use a similar approach in the development of criteria for classification of nuclear dust structures .",
    "this is largely because the circumnuclear dust classification is based on the hubble system , as well as the fact that some physical intuition ( or prejudice ) is unavoidable .",
    "nevertheless , we have developed this classification system with reference to the various morphological phenomena in the circumnuclear dust and have avoided reference to nuclear activity and any host galaxy properties ( with the exception of inclination ) .",
    "this approach was adopted to avoid bias imposed by the large scale structure that could obscure genuinely new characteristics of the circumnuclear region . in the following section , and in greater detail in a future paper , we discuss the relation between these different classes and nuclear and host galaxy properties .",
    "the presence of several connections between the circumnuclear classifications and both host and nuclear properties does suggest that real and distinct physical phenomena are connected to these different classes and we are not simply imposing order on chaos .      in our previous studies of circumnuclear structure in active galaxies",
    ", we noted that all of them are rich in dust structures and in most cases this dust takes the form of spiral features with greater or lesser degrees of coherence .",
    "the samples studied by @xcite and @xcite showed that circumnuclear dust structures have varying degrees of symmetry , number of spiral arms , and coherence , but were too small to search for the morphological trends necessary to establish a classification scheme for circumnuclear dust structures . in their recent morphological study of active and hii galaxies , @xcite did provide new classifications for many galaxies based on much smaller - scale structure than those used for the original rsa or rc3 classification , however in most cases these classifications were still largely based on the large - scale structure , rather than the dust morphology in the circumnuclear environment at spatial scales less than a kiloparsec .",
    "the color maps presented here more clearly show the dust morphology at radii as small as several resolution elements from the nucleus in all but the brightest active galaxies .",
    "these observations clearly show trends in the circumnuclear morphology that are similar , but not identical , to the larger - scale morphology and the most obvious similarity is in the nuclear spiral dust structure .",
    "this structure ranges from symmetric , two - arm spirals that appear similar to the beautiful grand - design spirals ngc1566 and ngc5194 , to multiarm spirals similar to ngc2336 , to spirals with only a few scattered arcs of dust . a significant fraction of the galaxies have no circumnuclear dust spirals and instead simply have more amorphous dust structures or have no dust structure in their circumnuclear region at all .",
    "we have divided the galaxies with clear evidence for spiral structure into four different classes , created a fifth class for those galaxies with chaotic circumnuclear dust , and a sixth class for galaxies that have no evidence of nonuniform dust .",
    "each of these classes are described below and an example of each class is shown in figure  [ fig : class ] .",
    "this class is defined by the presence of a symmetric , two arm dust spiral such as shown in ngc5643 ( shown in figure  [ fig : class ] ) and ngc1300 .",
    "these spirals appear similar to the grand design spirals found in the disks of many galaxies , yet these nuclear spirals are on scales less than a kiloparsec , rather than the many kiloparsecs of their larger namesakes .",
    "in addition , these arms are only traced by dust and do not exhibit the enhanced star formation and stellar surface density characteristic of galaxy - scale spiral density waves .",
    "the lack of star formation and absence of a detectable nir surface density enhancement suggests that grand design nuclear spirals either do not trace significant enhancements in the dust surface density or they have sufficient shear to inhibit star formation .",
    "estimates of the dust surface density increase in the arms by @xcite supports the former scenario , although this does not constrain the amount of shear in the dust lanes .",
    "many galaxies with grand design nuclear spirals have additional circumnuclear dust , often in the form of spiral arm fragments , in the interarm region between the grand design spiral arms ( e.g.ngc4303 , ngc6814 ) .",
    "we still classified galaxies as grand design nuclear spirals provided that the symmetric , two - arm structure was more prominent than the more irregular features in their interarm region . a common feature of many of these spirals ( and the additional types we define below ) is that the dust structures on one half of the circumnuclear disk are not as distinct as those in the other half , e.g.ngc6890 . as the division between the high and low contrast halves of the circumnuclear disk always coincides with the position angle of the host galaxy , we attribute this change in contrast to the inclination of the galaxy . in several cases ,",
    "this effect is so strong that only a hint of the second arm is apparent , yet we still classify a galaxy as a grand design nuclear spiral if a 180 degree rotation of the first arm would clearly align with any structure on the other side of the disk , as is the case for ngc2639 .      many galaxies with clear nuclear dust spirals lack either the clear symmetry of grand design spirals , two dust lanes , or both .",
    "we have separated these galaxies into two classes based upon the pitch angle of the nuclear spiral features .",
    "we classified spirals with small pitch angles as tightly wound ( tw ) and spirals with larger pitch angles as loosely wound ( lw ) .",
    "the dividing line in pitch angle corresponds roughly to hubble type sab .",
    "tightly wound nuclear spirals generally maintain their coherence for one or more complete rotations about the nucleus , e.g.ngc2985 ( figure  [ fig : class ] ) and ngc4030 .",
    "as is the case for grand design and other nuclear spirals , these arms do not appear to trace circumnuclear star formation , nor are they apparent in nir surface photometry .",
    "all of the remaining galaxies with coherent nuclear spirals , but with larger pitch angle ( comparable to the pitch angles exhibited by hubble types sb and later ) , are grouped into the class of loosely wound nuclear spirals . while these arms exhibit similar coherence as the tightly wound nuclear spirals , there are always several clear spiral arms in loosely wound nuclear spirals , e.g.ngc6951 ( figure  [ fig : class ] ) and ngc4941 , whereas the tightly wound nuclear spirals often have such sufficiently small pitch angles that it is difficult to discern the number of spiral arms present .",
    "although the lw nuclear spirals are well separated , all of the spiral arms in a given galaxy appear to have comparable pitch angles and imply the same sense of rotation .",
    "another common feature of lw spiral arms is that they are nearly always too loosely wound to make a complete rotation about the nucleus , whereas the tightly wound nuclear spirals typically make one or more complete rotations .",
    "this is not an obvious physical difference between the two types , however , as often signal - to - noise ( e.g.ngc3486 ) , the nicmos field of view ( e.g.ngc7392 ) , or larger scale structures in the host galaxy ( e.g.ngc6951 ) limit the apparent radial extent of the lw spirals .",
    "many galaxies exhibit evidence for one or more spiral arm fragments or dust arcs that suggest spiral structure , yet they lack the coherent structure over a large range in radius exhibited by the three classes described above .",
    "we classified these galaxies as chaotic nuclear spirals because they still show evidence for some spiral structure , though more reminiscent of the spiral features in irregular galaxies than in any of the traditional spiral galaxy classes .",
    "as in the case of the other types of nuclear dust spirals , the dust lanes also do not have star formation , which is not the case for the spiral arm fragments seen in irregulars .",
    "the chaotic spirals include dust spirals that are broken into many fragments ( e.g.ngc6221 ) or do not fill the entire circumnuclear disk ( e.g.ngc2460 ; figure  [ fig : class ] ) . in order to be included in this class , however , they do need to possess at least two spiral arms that suggest the same sense of rotation . for example , ngc3368 has at least two spiral arm fragments with the same sense of rotation , whereas ngc4260 , which we do not classify as a chaotic nuclear spiral , has at best one arm fragment . instead , we classify ngc4260 as a member of the chaotic class defined in the next subsection .",
    "these galaxies have clearly discernible , and often considerable , circumnuclear dust , yet without unambiguous evidence for spiral structure . while there are a few galaxies that suggest spiral features , such as ngc6946 ( figure  [ fig : class ] ) or ngc2336 , in both of these cases there are features of nearly equal size and contrast that could be due to spiral arms in a disk with the opposite sense of rotation .",
    "this class is in effect a catch - all for any galaxies that show no evidence for spiral structure , yet a larger sample could merit the division of this class into several distinct groups .",
    "for example , a number of these galaxies have straight dust lanes that completely cross the nucleus , such as ic5267 and ngc3627 .",
    "other galaxies are at relatively high inclination and have several straight dust lanes crossing the nucleus on one half , e.g.ngc4939 , ngc5033 and ngc5970 .",
    "if these galaxies were not so highly inclined relative to the line of sight , they might be classified as nuclear spirals .",
    "several other galaxies with high inclination simply have a large cloud of dust on what is presumably the near side of the disk , e.g.ngc4258 and ngc6300 , rather than many lanes of dust .",
    "the final class corresponds to galaxies with no dust structure in the circumnuclear region .",
    "galaxies in this class , e.g.ngc1398 ( figure  [ fig : class ] ) and ngc357 , do not show any dust structures within at least the central few hundred parsecs . for most of these galaxies there",
    "is also no evidence for nonuniform dust at larger radii .",
    "however , the case of ngc628 illustrates the complication caused by the large distance distribution of the full sample . in this galaxy",
    "the central region is essentially featureless , yet outside of approximately 200 parsecs radius there is significant spiral dust structure .",
    "nevertheless we have classified this galaxy as having no structure as the well - resolved central region is apparently free of dust lanes .",
    "the nuclear classifications for each galaxy are provided in the last column of table  [ tbl : nc ] .",
    "each galaxy was classified independently by two of us ( pm and mr ) after we agreed on the classification scheme described above and a set of prototypes for each class . the galaxies given above as examples of each class include the prototypes used for the classification .",
    "there were disagreements for nearly half of the galaxies .",
    "this high rate of disagreement is some cause for concern given the subjective nature of this process , yet upon closer scrutiny nearly all of the sources of conflict were between similar classes , such as between the chaotic spirals and chaotic or between chaotic spirals and loosely wound spirals .",
    "a blind reclassification of all of the sources of conflict led to resolution of most of the cases , which we attribute to our increased familiarity with the classification scheme .",
    "the remaining conflicts were resolved in binding arbitration ( provided by jm ) .",
    "galaxies with @xmath2 ( @xmath19 degrees ) were considered too highly inclined for a reliable classification .",
    "they have been labeled as high inclination ( hi ) systems in table  [ tbl : nc ] .",
    "there is a great deal of dust in these high inclination systems and occasionally nuclear spiral structure is visible , e.g.ngc  1320 . for these galaxies",
    "we have provided an additional classification after the hi in the table , although most just show chaotic dust structures . for inclinations greater than @xmath20 the fraction of galaxies classified as chaotic starts to increase noticeably and therefore only galaxies with @xmath21 are included in the detailed analysis described in paper  ii .",
    "many of these galaxies have high contrast dust features present on half of the color map and little or no structure on the opposite half .",
    "this appears to be due to the inclination of the host galaxy and can be used , as noted by @xcite , to break the degeneracy between the near and far sides of a galaxy .",
    "we assumed that lower contrast or the absence of dust features on one half of a circumnuclear disk was due to inclination alone and classified these cases as if similar dust structures were visible on both sides of the disk . for several galaxies , such as ngc3393 or ngc3458 ,",
    "the center of the galaxy fell near the edge of the nicmos image and therefore only half of the galaxy is present in the color map . in these instances , and in others where the signal - to - noise of the nir image was significantly worse than the visible image , we also used the wfpc2 ( @xmath15 ) image to aid in the classification . in the appendix",
    "we provide more detail on the classifications for individual galaxies .",
    "in figure  [ fig : agnhist ] we plot histograms of the fraction of active and inactive galaxies in each of the classes described above , as well as histograms of their distribution in heliocentric velocity ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 luminosities ( @xmath24 ) , hubble types ( t ) , size ( fraction of @xmath25 within the 20@xmath26 field of view ) , and inclination ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "each set of histograms is normalized such that a given bin reflects the fraction of the total active or inactive sample within that bin .",
    "the number on top of each histogram then gives the actual number of galaxies in that bin .",
    "the total number of galaxies in each panel does not add up to the 123 galaxies in the entire sample as there are typically several galaxies which fall outside the range of each histogram .",
    "the first histogram in figure  [ fig : agnhist ] shows that nuclear spiral structure is a very common feature in active galaxies as 52 of the 64 active galaxies ( with @xmath28 ) in this sample , or 80% , fall into one of the four classes of nuclear spiral structure defined above .",
    "nuclear spirals of some form are also found in the majority of the inactive galaxies we observed : 23 of the 39 inactive galaxies , or approximately 60% of the full sample .",
    "this sample size greatly exceeds the number studied in our previous work , in which we suggested that nuclear spirals could remove sufficient angular momentum to fuel nuclear activity .",
    "the remaining five histograms in the figure illustrate some of the potential biases that could affect the relative distributions of the active and inactive galaxies . from the distribution of host galaxy types",
    "it is apparent that the active galaxies are slightly biased toward an earlier mean hubble type than the inactive galaxies .",
    "the distribution in @xmath24 and @xmath22 shows that the active galaxies are on average also brighter and more distant than the inactive galaxies .",
    "the large number of distant active galaxies is partially due to the inclusion of the cfa seyferts , many of which are even more distant than the upper limit of @xmath29 for the last bin shown in figure  [ fig : agnhist ] .",
    "the lowest two panels show the size and inclination distributions .",
    "the active and inactive samples clearly have different size distributions .",
    "the angular size of the active galaxies are systematically smaller than the inactive galaxies , which shows that their greater mean distance more than offsets the fact that they are in brighter , presumably larger galaxies .",
    "the inclination distributions are similar for both samples .",
    "these many differences between the host galaxy properties of the active and inactive galaxies preclude any physical interpretation of the differences in the distributions of their circumnuclear dust classifications . in a future paper",
    "we will create subsamples of active and inactive galaxies without differences in their host galaxy properties and investigate the differences in their circumnuclear dust morphology in detail .",
    "in several agn the spiral nuclear dust lanes also appear to have segments illuminated by ionization cones emerging from the active nucleus .",
    "the most striking example is mrk 573 in which the grand design nuclear spiral appears to make two rotations about the nucleus , with 4 segments illuminated in emission in a double biconical form @xcite .",
    "several other galaxies also show dust lanes in absorption that become emission in a cone - shaped region centered on the nucleus , particularly mrk1066 and ngc788",
    ". this may also be the case in ngc3393 , which has spectacular s - shaped emission filaments inside the ionization cone @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath3 observation missed the nucleus and there is only a @xmath17 color map of one of the ionization cones , but the filaments on the ends of this emission become dust lanes at larger radii and outside the ionization cone .",
    "studies of both mrk573 @xcite and ngc3393 @xcite debate the relative importance of bow shocks and anisotropic nuclear ionization in the formation of these structures .",
    "following @xcite , who studied 4 galaxies , we find additional evidence that in at least some of these galaxies a significant fraction of the gas in the extended narrow - line regions is ambient gas photoionized _ in situ _ by the active nucleus .",
    "figure  [ fig : barhist ] shows a similar set of histograms for the barred and unbarred galaxies in the sample .",
    "the distribution of host properties for the barred and unbarred galaxies are much more similar than for the active and inactive galaxies , although the unbarred samples are slightly earlier hubble type , fainter , and more distant than the barred galaxies . given these similarities , the distribution of the barred and unbarred galaxies into the different circumnuclear dust classes can provide real physical insight into the interaction of a large scale bar and the circumnuclear ism , and these distributions do show some striking trends .",
    "the most prominent trend is that grand design nuclear spirals are only present in barred galaxies .",
    "there are 19 barred galaxies , or 27% or the sample , with grand design nuclear spirals , yet no unbarred galaxies .",
    "given the fraction of unbarred galaxies in the sample , we would expect there to be eight unbarred galaxies with grand design nuclear spirals if this form of circumnuclear structure were independent of the presence of a large scale bar .",
    "straight dust lanes in strong , large - scale bars have been observed in galaxies such as ngc1300 or ngc7479",
    ". simulations of barred galaxies show that shock fronts develop in the interstellar medium in strong bars @xcite",
    ". these shocks can extend inwards as a grand - design spiral , depending on the properties of the potential and ism , and cause dissipation when gas flows across them @xcite .",
    "simulations of gas flow in bars have shown that the angle between the bar and the dust lanes depends on the strength of the bar , where the dust lanes in the strongest bars are parallel to the bar s semimajor axis @xcite .",
    "these dust lanes have the greatest shear , and consequently both the largest inflow and no associated star formation .",
    "dust lanes in weaker bars ( e.g.which on average correspond to type ",
    "sab  in the rc3 catalog , although with significant scatter * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have less shear and some bars , such as in ngc1566 @xcite , have star formation in their dust lanes .",
    "several of the galaxies ( ngc4253 , ngc5135 , ngc5383 , and ngc7130 ) in this sample with dust lanes and grand design nuclear spirals also have star formation associated with the large scale bar s dust lanes , which indicates that grand design nuclear dust spirals are not only found in strong bars .",
    "there are also barred galaxies with straight dust lanes that do not form grand design nuclear spirals , such as ngc4314 and ngc6951 , where the bar dust lanes end in rings .",
    "estimates or direct observations of gas flow along the dust lanes in bars have been made for ngc1097 @xcite and ngc7479 @xcite .",
    "recent , higher - resolution simulations have shown that the infalling material may become sheared by differential rotation within the inner lindblad resonance of the bar or smoothed by a high sound speed @xcite .",
    "this differential rotation creates a symmetric , two - arm spiral like the grand design nuclear spiral class .",
    "@xcite used their models to demonstrate how the pitch angle and coherence of the nuclear dust spirals depends on the central mass concentration and the pressure in the ism , which is parametrized by a single value for the sound speed in their simulations .",
    "models with greater central concentrations have more tightly wound arms , as do models with lower sound speeds .",
    "there is a wide range of pitch angle among the grand design nuclear spirals shown in figure  [ fig : cmaps ] , which offer the opportunity to test the predictions of these simulations in detail .",
    "for example , the grand design nuclear spiral arms in ngc1530 or ngc5643 have larger pitch angles than those in ngc1300 or mrk573 . as noted above",
    ", the observations of grand design nuclear spirals show that their circumnuclear disks are generally filled with finer dust structures in regions that are not dominated by the large , two - arm spiral .",
    "the presence of these smaller , flocculent spiral structures mixed with the dominant , two - arm spiral is a clear difference between the observations of grand - design spirals and the simulations of @xcite , who only produce the two - arm spiral .",
    "this difference may be due to the use of a single sound speed to characterize the ism in their simulations as filamentary structure is seen in multiphase ism models @xcite .",
    "filamentary structure is also seen in multiphase ism models which include a weak bar potential @xcite , where the introduction of a multiphase ism causes smooth spiral shocks to break down into parsec - scale , fine structure .",
    "a second trend apparent in the nuclear class distribution is that the tightly wound nuclear spiral class appears to be much more common in unbarred galaxies than barred galaxies .",
    "there are eight unbarred galaxies with tightly wound nuclear spirals , or 26% of the sample , yet only three barred galaxies , or 4% of the sample , have tightly wound spirals . as barred galaxies outnumber unbarred galaxies by approximately three to one , and there was no obvious selection bias in favor or against circumnuclear structure in galaxies with or without large scale bars , this also appears to be real and not the spurious result of a combination of selection effects .",
    "in our sample of 123 galaxies we find 14 galaxies with a ringlike structure in the @xmath30 fields shown in figure  [ fig : cmaps ] .",
    "eight are cases of strong nuclear rings that have both current star formation and may also have an older stellar population . in these eight galaxies",
    "the basic morphology of the star formation and dust is the same : the star formation is clumpy and the star formation occurs outside of the dust ring .",
    "five of the galaxies show the ring almost equally on both sides of the galaxy ( ngc1667 , ngc2273 , ngc3351 , ngc4314 , and ngc6951 ) and three galaxies ( ngc1672 , ngc5427 , and ngc6890 ) show the star formation clearer on one side of the galaxy and the dust clearer on the other side of the galaxy .",
    "in all the cases , the dust morphology is clumpy with the dust fragments implying a spiral - like shape .",
    "the sense of the spiral pattern in the dust is in the same sense as the rotation of the nuclear ring , assuming that the gas in the bar dust lanes curves into the rings @xcite .",
    "there also seems to be a tendency for the most active region of star formation to be between the dust ring and where the bar dust lanes joins the nuclear ring .",
    "four additional galaxies appear to have old stellar rings that are visible in both the @xmath15 and @xmath3 images .",
    "two of these rings do not appear to have any associated dust : eso138-g1 and mrk477 , and two have dust lanes immediately interior to the ring : ngc1300 and ngc3081 .",
    "the final two galaxies have bright star formation rings , one a very small nuclear starburst ring in ngc864 and the other the larger starburst ring in ngc7469 .",
    "the properties of the galaxies with rings are summarized in table  [ tbl : ring ] and additional information for several of these rings , many of which were previously studied from the ground by @xcite , are provided in the appendix .",
    "we have presented _ hst_observations of circumnuclear dust structure in a large sample of nearby galaxies . the color maps which trace",
    "this dust structure show that the nuclear dust spirals reported previously are the most common morphological feature in the circumnuclear region of spiral galaxies , irrespective of the presence or absence of an active nucleus or a large - scale bar .",
    "we have defined a set of four different classes of nuclear spiral structure that together encompass the main morphological features of nuclear spiral structure .",
    "there are in addition many galaxies that show no evidence of nuclear spiral structures and these galaxies have either very chaotic circumnuclear dust or no clearly discernible dust structure in their circumnuclear environment .",
    "while the entire sample is too heterogeneous for a detailed examination of the frequency of nuclear spiral structure in active and inactive galaxies beyond the statement that it is a common feature of both types , there are several results , including two clear differences between barred and unbarred galaxies , that should not be affected by the various selection effects in this sample :    \\1 .",
    "only galaxies with large scale bars exhibit grand design nuclear spiral structure . where high - quality data on larger scales is available , the two arms of the grand design nuclear spiral connect to the dust lanes on the leadings edges of the large scale bar .",
    "as these cases demonstrate that some large scale bars can remove sufficient angular momentum to transport matter to within at least tens of parsecs of the nucleus , they provide qualitative support to the hypothesis that some large scale bars can directly fuel nuclear activity",
    ". however , these dust lanes are also found in galaxies that are not known to harbor agn .",
    "tightly wound nuclear spiral arms are more likely to be found in unbarred galaxies than barred galaxies .",
    "several active galaxies with prominent ionization cones , most notably mrk573 , mrk1066 , and ngc788 , show that the emission line gas is the same material that forms the spiral dust lanes in the circumnuclear region .",
    "these dust lanes , traced by their absorption of stellar light , become bright emission regions where they cross the opening angle of the ionization cone from the nucleus .    in a future paper",
    "we will compare a subsample of active galaxies to an inactive , control sample matched in hubble type , luminosity , heliocentric velocity , size , and inclination to determine if there are any differences in the circumnuclear dust structures between active and inactive galaxies .",
    "we will also employ a similar sample - matching strategy to verify these differences between the circumnuclear dust structures of barred and unbarred galaxies to extend the results described above .",

    "<S> the combination of these forces shapes both circumnuclear star formation and the growth of the central , supermassive black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we present visible and near - infrared _ hubble space telescope _ images and color maps of 123 nearby galaxies that show the distribution of the cold ism , as traced by dust , with excellent spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> these observations reveal that nuclear dust spirals are found in the majority of active and inactive galaxies and they possess a wide range in coherence , symmetry , and pitch angle . </S>",
    "<S> we have used this large sample to develop a classification system for circumnuclear dust structures . in spite of the heterogeneous nature of the complete sample , we only find symmetric </S>",
    "<S> , two - arm nuclear dust spirals in galaxies with large scale bars and these dust lanes clearly connect to dust lanes along the leading edges of the large scale bars . </S>",
    "<S> not all dust lanes along large scale bars form two arm spirals , however , and several instead end in nuclear rings . </S>",
    "<S> we find that tightly wound , or low pitch angle , nuclear dust spirals are more common in unbarred galaxies than barred galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the extended narrow line region in several of the active galaxies is well - resolved . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between the ionized gas and circumnuclear dust lanes in four of these galaxies provides additional evidence that a significant fraction of their extended narrow line region is ambient gas photoionized _ in situ _ by the active nucleus . in a future paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will use our classification system for circumnuclear dust to identify differences between active and inactive galaxies , as well as barred and unbarred galaxies , in well - matched subsamples of these data . </S>"
