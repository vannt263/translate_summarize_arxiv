    ", title=\"fig:\",width=168 ]    given that sbs  0335052e and w are among the lowest metallicity galaxies known , it is interesting to see if the star formation occurs at a similar gas threshold density as for more metal - rich galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested that star formation in dwarf galaxies occurs only when the gas column - density crosses a threshold value of @xmath010@xmath13  atoms  @xmath11 ; this in turn could be related to a threshold amount of dust shielding required for the production of molecular gas . in this case , one would expect that the threshold column - density increases with decreasing gas - phase metallicity .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) suggests a different model , one in which star formation is related to the formation of a cold phase of the interstellar medium . from his fitting formulae for the threshold column density , the threshold density increases with increasing gas fraction and decreasing metallicity ( all other factors being equal ) . in this model too , gas - rich xmd galaxies should have a higher threshold for star formation than spirals .",
    "this issue was also explored , in detail , in @xcite , who found no conclusive evidence for an increase in threshold density with metallicity , albeit in a relatively small sample of xmd galaxies .",
    "the  column densities at the positions of the brightest star - forming regions in sbs  0335052e and sbs  0335052w are @xmath02.0 and 5.4  @xmath9  10@xmath13  atoms  @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the measurements were made at a resolution of @xmath03.4 and 2.75  arcsec ( 880 and 715  pc ) , respectively .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio for sbs  0335052e was too low for the column density to be measured at the higher resolution used for sbs  0335052w .",
    "in sbs  0335052e , the  peak is slightly ( i.e. , @xmath01.5  arcsec , or 0.4  kpc ) , offset from the brightest star - forming region ( as was already noticed from the vla data ( pustilnik et al .",
    "nevertheless , it lies within a half beam - width of the latter .",
    "the western  peak is also slightly ( @xmath01  arcsec , or 0.26  kpc ) offset from the brightest star - forming region in sbs  0335052w .",
    "note that the column densities have not been corrected for inclination , because , as discussed above , it is difficult to estimate the inclination angles of the  discs .",
    "the  column density of sbs  0335052e , as calculated from its _ hst _ spectral observations by @xcite , is 7.0  @xmath14  0.5  @xmath9  10@xmath13  atoms  @xmath11 . the higher value that they obtain is presumably a result of the much higher angular resolution of the _ hst _ data .",
    "these peak  column densities , are amongst the largest values found in gas - rich dwarf or xmd galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; ekta et al .",
    "2006 ; ekta et al .",
    "this is despite the fact that all the above mentioned studies have better linear resolution than that of our observations , except for a few galaxies in taylor et al .",

    "-8.0 cm -6.0 cm 8.0 cm     sbs  0335052 is the lowest metallicity star - forming system known .",
    "the system is further peculiar in being an interacting pair of dwarf galaxies . in the case of sbs",
    "0335052e , the metallicity is low not just in the ionized  regions , but also in the surrounding  gas . from fuse observations ,",
    "@xcite find that the metallicity in the   envelope is similar to that in the central star - forming regions .",
    "our  data shows that the pair is in an advanced stage of interaction , with the gas being pulled out to form a bridge , as well as into elongated tidal tails . as discussed in section  [ sec : res ] , if the dynamic - to - baryonic mass ratio is @xmath1510 , the system is bound , and will eventually merge .",
    "the relatively short tails , and the faintness of the ` bridge ' then suggest that the pair is probably past its first close encounter , but has yet to fall towards each other for the second time ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite show that starbursts can be triggered in extremely gas - rich galaxies , which are undergoing their first close encounter , depending on the details of the galaxy structure and the orbit geometry .",
    "the starburst onset could range from being just before the first close encounter ( e.g. , for very close , planar encounters ) to 0.10.4  gyr after the encounter .",
    "the relatively broad tidal features ( as opposed to the narrow long features produced by direct encounters ) also suggest that neither of the galaxies is undergoing a direct encounter ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed from fig .",
    "[ fig : mom ] , one can see that if the elongated structure seen in the central regions of sbs  0335052w reflects the underlying gas disc , the galaxy is undergoing a highly inclined encounter .",
    "interestingly , all of the six lowest - metallicity star - forming xmd galaxies known are either currently undergoing tidal interactions , or appear to be the remnants of a merger of extremely gas - rich progenitors @xcite . while interactions have long been regarded as triggers for starbursts , numerical simulations show that , in fact , only a small fraction of all binary interactions lead to a reasonably strong starburst @xcite .",
    "the enhancement in the star formation rate during merger depends on a number of factors , but in general ( in recent models ) the internal structure ( e.g. , presence of a bulge , gas - mass fraction , disc - stability factor , etc . )",
    "appear to play a more crucial role in determining the strength and duration of the starburst than the interaction geometry @xcite .",
    "in particular , for gas - rich galaxies , @xcite find that the amplitude of the starburst , which occurs just after the first close passage , is generally stronger than for gas - poor galaxies .    in the current situation ,",
    "the galaxies concerned are both extremely gas - rich dwarfs , and are likely to have similar internal structure . while numerical simulations of such systems are very limited , for somewhat less gas - rich systems , @xcite show that coplanar orbits lead to somewhat stronger starbursts than inclined orbits .",
    "as discussed above , sbs  0335052w appears to be undergoing an inclined encounter , which could perhaps be the reason for its relatively lower star formation rate .",
    "as far as simulations of interacting , gas - rich galaxies are concerned , @xcite show that a direct encounter between two giant , extremely gas - rich discs can lead to the formation of spiral - galaxy - like gas - rich remnant .",
    "the star formation rate is enhanced both during the first close passage as well as during the final merger . in general ,",
    "gas - rich mergers tend to show larger enhancements in the instantaneous star formation rate than gas - poor ones , both because there is more raw material available for star formation , and also because of the inherent instability of thin gas discs @xcite .",
    "we used the recently released identikit tool @xcite to model the interaction in the sbs  0335052 system .",
    "since identikit is based on collisionless n - body simulations , we compare only the morphology of the outer regions and the velocity - field projections .",
    "the best possible match , that we could find , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : identikit ] , along with the data projections in the same co - ordinate system .",
    "while the match is not perfect ( given the limitations of the model , a perfect match is perhaps not to be expected ) the parameters from the match could be taken as indicative . in the displayed model ,",
    "the galaxies undergo a close ( pericenter distance of @xmath00.55  kpc ) encounter , which is somewhat retrograde encounter for sbs0335052e , and close to polar for sbs  0335052w .",
    "the sky plane is inclined @xmath045  degrees with respect to the orbit plane .",
    "the observed snapshot corresponds to shortly ( @xmath00.1  gyr ) after the first perigalacticon . from optical colours , the major enhanced star formation in both components",
    "is estimated to have started 0.10.4  gyr ago .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is consistent with the star formation acitivity starting just before the pericenter passage , as predicted for some cases of very close encounters in gas - rich mergers @xcite . a more detailed simulation of this unique pair would be highly desirable .",
    "while the interaction in sbs  0335052 is likely to have triggered the current starburst , it almost certainly plays an important role in the long - term evolution of the system .",
    "@xcite presents results from numerical simulations of gas - rich dwarf galaxies , and shows that in the case where there is no stellar bulge , and the gas is initially in a cold disc , the merger remnant resembles a moderately gas - rich bcd ( blue compact dwarf ) galaxy .",
    "the central compact emission comes from a starburst triggered by the inflow of gas from the outskirts of the initial cold disc .",
    "high gas pressures in the star - forming regions also lead to the formation of massive star clusters ( as seen for sbs  0335052e ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the role of high pressures in forming massive star clusters was also discussed earlier by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further , @xcite find that the strength of the central starburst found in merging gas - rich galaxies depends critically on the assumed disc stability .",
    "simulations in which gas dissipation has been decreased to prevent excessive disc fragmentation for isolated galaxies ( e.g. , their particle - mesh - sticky - particles ( pm - sm ) simulation ) show very little enhancement of star formation during the merger .",
    "further , even in their simulations which do show an enhancement in the star formation rate , the major cause of the enhancement is induced disc instabilities , and not inflow of gas .",
    "while a significant radial metallicity gradient is known to exist in large spiral galaxies , such strong gradients have not been found in dwarf galaxies , and hence , the role that infalling gas plays in lowering the metallicity of the central regions may not be important .",
    "inflow of metal - poor gas is one possible cause for sizable metal deficiency in central star - forming regions of some dwarf galaxies .",
    "other possible causes are ( a ) preferential loss of metal - enriched gas , i.e. , escape of supernova metal - enriched material from previous starbursts , ( b ) infall of pristine ` gas clouds ' from the intergalactic medium , ( c ) very slow evolution of locally very stable gas discs ( extreme low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ) , which fortuitously ( e.g. , due to residing in a void ) escaped strong external disturbances and related additional star formation , and ( d ) a genuinely young galaxy which has not undergone much star formation ( i.e. , due to a too small an age ) .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that sufficiently strong starbursts , in sufficiently small galaxies , could indeed lead to significant outflow of metal - enriched gas . a high spatial and velocity resolution study of the ionized gas around the starburst region in sbs  0335052e has indeed identified a high velocity ( @xmath050  km  s@xmath5 ) outflow @xcite . the final fate of this outflowing gas ( i.e. , whether it escapes from the galaxy or falls back to form a ` galactic fountain ' ) depends on several parameters , including the mass of the parent galaxy , the presence of a hot - gas halo from the previous star formation activity , etc .. in addition , the positive feedback from massive , compact superstar clusters could also inhibit outflow of gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as far as infall of pristine gas clouds is concerned , our present data does not show any evidence for this , although the possibility that higher sensitivity data may show such clouds can not be ruled out .",
    "the sbs  0335052 system is especially unusual in that both galaxies in the pair are extremely metal - deficient , with metallicities differing by only a factor @xmath01.5 .",
    "one possible explanation for their similar metallicities is that there has been an exchange and mixing of gas during their interaction .",
    "however , this seems unlikely , because of the faintness of the observed ` bridge ' , and also because gas exchange is not believed to be very efficient during the first encounter of equal - mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "it seems likely therefore , that the similar metallicities of these two galaxies are due to similar evolutionary histories . in this context , it is interesting to note that the sbs  0335052 system is located near the edge of a large void @xcite , and that there appears to be , in general , an indication of excess of metal - deficient galaxies in voids @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the most metal - poor galaxies known , viz .",
    ", sbs  0335052 , i  zw  18 and ddo  68 , all appear to be interacting or merger remnants . indeed , in the order given above",
    ", one could take these galaxies as forming a ` merger sequence ' , ( with sbs  0335052 being just past the first close passage , ddo  68 being a merger remnant @xcite and i  zw  18 @xcite being at an intermediate phase ) of extremely gas - rich galaxies .    to summarize ,",
    "our multi - resolution  observations show that the sbs  0335052 system consists of a merging galaxy pair . at the lowest resolution",
    ", we see a faint diffuse ` bridge ' joining the two galaxies ( although the possibility of all of the observed emission arising from beam smearing can not be completely ruled out ) , while at higher resolutions , we see both  concentrations around the stellar bodies as well as elongated tidal tails .",
    "the velocity fields are complex , and , at large - scales are dominated by the velocity difference between the galaxies and the velocity gradient along the tidal tails . at still higher resolution , we see that in sbs  0335052e , the ionized superbubble identified in the _ hst _ images by thuan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is extended along one of the tidal tails , while there is a clump of high - density   gas at the other end of the superbubble .",
    "this is consistent with a scenario , in which the propagating star formation seen in this galaxy is driven by a superbubble expanding into a medium with a tidally - produced density gradient .",
    "in contrast to sbs  0335052e , the higher resolution maps for sbs  0335052w suggest that it is undergoing a somewhat polar encounter .",
    "given the similar  parameters of both galaxies , this difference in encounter geometry is possibly the reason for the weaker tidal disturbance and the resulting large difference in the past and current star formation in the e and w components .",

    "<S> we present giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) ,  21 cm observations of sbs  0335052e and sbs  0335052w , a close pair of dwarf galaxies , which are further unusual in being the most metal - poor star - forming galaxies known . </S>",
    "<S> we present images at several angular resolutions , ranging from @xmath040 to 4  arcsec . </S>",
    "<S> these images show that sbs  0335052 is a strongly interacting system , with a faint diffuse bridge seen at low resolution , and elongated tails seen at the higher resolutions . </S>",
    "<S> the overall morphology suggests that the pair represents a major ( as both galaxies have similar  masses ) merger of extremely gas - rich galaxies , which is currently past the first close encounter . </S>",
    "<S> the low - resolution velocity field is dominated by the velocity difference between the two galaxies and the velocity gradient along the tidal features . however , for sbs  0335052w at least , at high angular resolution , one sees a central velocity field that could be associated with the spin of the original undisturbed disc . </S>",
    "<S> the two galaxies have very similar  masses , but very different optical properties and current star formation rates . </S>",
    "<S> a possible reason for this is the differing amounts of tidally - induced star formation , because of the different spin orientations of these interacting galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the highest angular resolution  images show that the ionized superbubble , identified by thuan , izotov @xmath1 lipovetsky ( 1997 ) , in the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) images of sbs  0335052e , is extended along one of the diffuse tidal features , and that there is a high - density  clump at the other end of the superbubble . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation in sbs  0335052e occurs mainly in a group of superstar clusters ( sscs ) with a clear age gradient ; the age decreases as one approaches the dense  clump . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this propagating star formation is driven by the superbubble expanding into a medium with a tidally - produced density gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the high pressures associated with the compressed material would also naturally explain why current star formation is mainly concentrated in superstar clusters .    </S>",
