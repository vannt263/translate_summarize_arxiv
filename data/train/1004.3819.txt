    "transiting exoplanets and eclipsing binaries produce familiar u- and v - shaped lightcurves with several defining quantities , such as the mid - eclipse time , eclipse depth and duration . out of these , the transit duration is undoubtedly the most difficult observeable to express in terms of the physical parameters of the system . kipping ( 2008 )",
    "showed that the duration is found by solving a quartic equation , to which exists a well - known solution . in general , two roots",
    "correspond to the primary eclipse and two to the secondary but this correspondence determination has an intricate dependency on the input parameters for which there currently exists no proposed rules . as a consequence",
    ", there currently exists no single exact expression for the transit duration .    in many applications ,",
    "the process of discarding unwanted roots may be performed by a computer , but naturally this can only be accomplished for case - by - case examples .",
    "the benefits of a concise , accurate and general expression for the transit duration , as we will refer to it from now on , are manifold .",
    "the solution provides lower computation times , deeper insight into the functional dependence of the duration and a decorrelated parameter set for fitting eclipse lightcurves ( see  6 ) .",
    "such a solution may also be readily differentiated to investigate the effects of secular and periodic changes in the system ( see  7 ) . with the changes in transit duration recently being proposed as a method of detecting additional exoplanets in the system ( miralda - escud 2002 ; heyl & gladman 2007 ) and companion exomoons ( kipping 2009a , b ) , there is a strong motivation to ensure an accurate , elegant equation is available .    in this work , we will first propose a new approximate expression for the transit duration in  2 . in  3 , we will derive two new approximate expressions for the transit duration and discuss others found in the literature ; exploring their respective physical assumptions and derivations . in  4 , we present the results of numerical tests of the various formulae .",
    "we find that one of our new proposed expressions offers the greatest accuracy out of the candidates . in  5 and  6",
    ", we utilize the new equation to derive mappings between the observeable transit durations and the physical model parameters .",
    "these mappings may be used to obtain a decorrelated transit lightcurve fitting parameter set , which enhances the compuational efficiency of monte carlo based methods . finally ,",
    "in  7 , we differentiate the favoured solution to predict how the transit duration will change due to apsidal precession , nodal precession , in - fall and eccentricity variation .",
    "before we begin our investigation , let us first clearly define what we mean by the transit duration . there exists several different definitions of what constitutes as the transit duration in the exoplanet literature . in figure 1 , we present a visual comparison of these definitions .",
    "there exists at least 7 different duration definitions : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are the definitions used by @xcite and represent the @xmath8 to @xmath9 and @xmath10 to @xmath11 contact durations respectively .",
    "these can be understood to be the total transit duration and the flat - bottomed transit duration ( sometimes confusingly referred to as the full duration ) .",
    "@xmath3 is the time for a planet to move from its sky - projected centre overlapping with the stellar limb to exitting under the same condition .",
    "@xmath4 is a parameter we define in this work as the average of @xmath1 and @xmath2 which we call the transit width .",
    "we note that @xmath12 since when the planet s centre crosses the limb of star , less than one half of the planet s projected surface blocks the light from the star .",
    "however , many sources in literature make the approximation @xmath13 , which is only true for a trapezoid approximated lightcurve ( a detailed discussion on this is given in  6.3 ) . finally , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the ingress and egress durations respectively which are often approximated to be equal to one single parameter , @xmath5 .        throughout this paper , we assume that the planet is a black sphere emitting no flux crossing the disc of a perfectly spherical star .",
    "the consequences for oblate planets is discussed by @xcite and for hot planets with significant nightside fluxes in @xcite .",
    "we will employ the definition of @xmath3 for the transit duration .",
    "once the equation for @xmath3 is known , it is trivial to transmute it to give any of the other definitions provided in figure 1 .",
    "an exact solution for @xmath3 , in terms of the true anomaly @xmath14 , is given by integrating d@xmath14/d@xmath15 between @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( where we use @xmath14 to describe true anomaly throughout this paper ) .",
    "details of the derivation can be found in k08 , but to summarize we have :    @xmath18 \\\\ & d(f ) = 2 \\sqrt{1-e^2 } \\tan^{-1 } \\big[\\sqrt{\\frac{1-e}{1+e } } \\tan{\\frac{f}{2}}\\big ] - \\frac{e ( 1-e^2 ) \\sin f}{1+e \\cos f } \\\\ & d(f_b ) - d(f_a ) = 2 \\sqrt{1-e^2 } \\tan^{-1}\\bigg[\\frac{\\sqrt{1-e^2 } \\sin f_h}{\\cos f_h+e \\cos f_m}\\bigg ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\qquad & -\\frac{2 e ( 1-e^2 ) \\sin f_h ( e \\cos f_h + \\cos f_m)}{(1-e^2 ) \\sin^2f_m + ( e \\cos f_h+\\cos f_m)^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the planetary orbital period , @xmath20 is the orbital eccentricity , @xmath21 is the ` duration function ' , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is clear that two principal terms define @xmath24 and hence we dub the expressions used here as the ` two - term ' transit duration equation . at this point ,",
    "the outstanding problem is solving for @xmath17 and @xmath16 , which are the true anomalies at the contact points .",
    "the k08 solution is derived using cartesian coordinates , but we consider here a simpler formulation in terms of @xmath25 . in order to solve , we must first consider the geometry of the system .",
    "as with k08 , an ellipse is rotated for argument of pericentre and then orbital inclination . we choose to define our coordinate system with the star at the origin with the @xmath26 axis pointing at the observer .",
    "we also choose to align the @xmath27 axis towards the ascending node of the planetary orbit , which ensures that the longitude of the ascending node satisfies @xmath28 and the longitude of pericentre ( of the planetary orbit ) is equal to the argument of the pericentre ( @xmath29 ) . in such a coordinate system , we may write the sky - projected planet - star separation ( in units of stellar radii ) :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the semi - major axis in units of stellar radii ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 is the orbital inclination .",
    "the two contact points occur when @xmath34 is equal to unity . for a body which undergoes both primary and secondary transit",
    ", there must be at least four solutions , which already is an indication of a quartic .",
    "if we let @xmath35 and rearrange ( 4 ) in terms of purely terms in @xmath36 , we obtain the following quartic equation :    @xmath37    equation ( 5 ) is a quartic equation not satisfying any of the special case quartics which are most easily solved ( e.g. a biquadratic ) .",
    "since we have four roots for @xmath38 , there are eight roots in total for @xmath14 , of which only four are physical .",
    "therefore it is preferable to always work with @xmath39 since @xmath21 may be easily expressed in terms of @xmath36 as well .",
    "although the solutions of a quartic equation are well known , two of the roots correspond to the primary transit and two to the secondary .",
    "the correspondence of which roots relate to which contact points varies with an intricate dependency on the input parameters .",
    "unfortunately , no known rules or relations currently exist for this correspondence and we were unable to find a system either .",
    "consequently , there currently exists no single exact equation for the transit duration .",
    "we note that the problem of finding the duration of an eclipse is not a new one .",
    "an equivalent problem is considered in @xcite for the time taken for a body to move between primary and secondary transit .",
    "@xcite showed that an closed - form expression is possible by assuming @xmath40 .",
    "however , this assumption would be too erroneous for the purposes of finding the duration of a transit event .      in order to avoid the quartic equation",
    ", we must make an approximation .",
    "a useful approximation we can make is that @xmath41 , i.e. the planet - star separation is approximately a constant value given by the planet - star separation at mid - transit .",
    "defining the transit impact parameter as @xmath42 , it may be shown that the difference between @xmath16 and @xmath17 is given by :    @xmath43    in addition to ( 12 ) , we require @xmath44",
    ". a good approximation would appear to be that @xmath45 , which is the true anomaly at mid - transit .",
    "@xmath46 is defined as the point where @xmath34 is a minimum .",
    "differentiating @xmath34 with respect to @xmath14 and solving for @xmath14 leads to a quartic expression again and thus an exact concise solution remains elusive but a good approximation is given by :    @xmath47      by combining equations ( 1 ) & ( 3 ) with ( 12 ) & ( 13 ) , we are able to obtain a final expression for the duration , which we dub @xmath48 ( ` two - term ' ) . testing @xmath49 for the exact solutions for @xmath50 and @xmath51 provided precisely the correct transit duration for all @xmath20 , as expected .",
    "however , we found that using approximate entries for these terms severely limited the precision of the derived equation for large @xmath20 ( the results of numerical tests will be shown later in  4 ) .",
    "the source of the problem comes from equation ( 3 ) which consists of taking the difference between two terms . both terms are of comparable magnitude for large @xmath20 and thus we are obtaining a small term by taking the difference between two large terms .",
    "these kinds of expressions are very sensitive to slight errors . in our case ,",
    "the error is from using approximate entries for @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in this next section",
    ", we will consider possible ` one - term expressions ' which avoid the problem of taking the difference of two comparable - magnitude terms .",
    "there are numerous possible methods for finding ` one - term ' transit duration expressions .",
    "starting from equation ( 1 ) , we could consider using the same assumption which we used to derive the approximate true anomalistic duration , @xmath52 ; i.e. the planet - star separation does not change during the transit event .",
    "this would yield :    @xmath53    where we have used equation ( 12 ) for @xmath52 .",
    "another derivation would be to assume the planet takes a tangential orbital velocity and constant orbital separation from the planet , sweeping out an arc of length @xmath54 .",
    "it is trivial to show that this argument will lead to precisely the same expression for @xmath55 .",
    "for a circular orbit , the task of finding the transit duration is greatly simplified due to the inherent symmetry of the problem and an exact , concise solution is possible , as first presented by @xcite ( smo03 ) .",
    "@xmath56    the physical origin of this expression can be seen as simply multiplying the reciprocal of the planet s tangential orbital velocity ( which is a constant for circular orbits ) , by the distance covered over the swept - out arc , @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58    where we expand the first term as the orbital period divided by the orbital circumference , and the second term as the arc length .",
    "it may be shown that :    @xmath59    it can be seen that our approximate expression for @xmath52 , presented in equation ( 12 ) is equivalent to equation ( 18 ) for circular orbits .",
    "it is also worth noting that both @xmath55 and @xmath49 can be shown to reduce down to @xmath60 for circular orbits .",
    "@xcite ( ts05 ) presented expressions for the duration of an eccentric transiting planet , which has been used by numerous authors since ( e.g. ford et al .",
    "2008 ; jordn & bakos 2008 ) .",
    "it is also forms the basis of a lightcurve parameter fitting set proposed by bakos et al .",
    "there are two critical assumptions made in the derivation of the ts05 formula .",
    "the first of these is that :    * the planet - star separation , @xmath61 , is constant during the planetary transit event and equals @xmath62    this is the same assumption made in the derivation of the @xmath55 equation . under this assumption ,",
    "ts05 quote the following expression for @xmath3 ( changing to consistent notation ) .",
    "@xmath63    where ts05 define @xmath62 as the planet - star separation at the moment of mid - transit , @xmath64 as the planet s orbital velocity at the moment of mid - transit and @xmath65 as ` the eccentric angle between the first and last contacts of transit ' .",
    "in the standard notation , there is no such parameter defined strictly as the ` eccentric angle ' and thus we initially assumed that ts05 were referring to the eccentric anomaly .",
    "however , substiuting the revevant terms for @xmath62 and @xmath64 gives :    @xmath66    by comparing ( 20 ) to equation ( 14 ) , it is clear @xmath67 ( also note equation ( 14 ) was derived under precisely the same assumptions as that assumed by ts05 at this stage of the derivation ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the term ts05 refer to as ` eccentric angle ' infact refers to true anomaly .",
    "this is an important point to make because the derivation of the ts05 equation would otherwise be very difficult to understand by those working outside of the field .",
    "continueing the derivation from this point , the second assumption made by ts05 is :    * the planet - star separation is much greater than the stellar radius , @xmath68    critically , this assumption was not made in the derivation of @xmath55 or @xmath49 . using this assumption , ts05 propose that ( replacing @xmath69 to remain consistent with the notations used in this work and replacing @xmath70 to refer to @xmath3 rather than the duration from contact points 1 to 4 ) :    @xmath71    where ts05 use equation ( 22 ) rather than ( 21 ) in the final version of @xmath3",
    "therefore , ts05 effectively make a small - angle approximation for @xmath52 , which is a knock - on effect of assuming @xmath68 .",
    "we argue here that losing the @xmath72 function does not offer any great simplification of the transit duration equation but does lead to an unneccessary source of error in the resultant expression , in particular for close - in orbits , which is common for transits .",
    "we also note that even equation ( 21 ) exhibits differences to equation ( 12 ) .",
    "firstly , inside the @xmath72 function , the factor of @xmath73 is missing which is present in both the derivation we presented in equation ( 12 ) and the derivation of smo03 for circular orbits , equation ( 18 ) .",
    "the absence of this term can be understood as a result of the @xmath68 assumption . as @xmath74",
    ", in order to maintain a transit event , we must have @xmath75 .",
    "secondly , the expression we presented for @xmath52 earlier in ( 12 ) has the factor of 2 present outside of the arcsin function , whereas ts05 have this factor inside the function .",
    "furthermore , the smo03 derivation also predicts that the factor of 2 should be outside of the @xmath72 function and this expression is known to be an exact solution for circular orbits . in a small angle approximation ,",
    "@xmath76 , but we point out that moving the factor of 2 to within the @xmath72 function seems to serve no purpose except to invite further error into the expression . as a result of these differences , the ts05 expression for",
    "@xmath3 does not reduce down to the original smo03 equation and is given by :    @xmath77      @xcite ( w10 ) proposed an expression for @xmath3 based on modification to the smo03 equation .",
    "the first change was to modify the impact parameter from @xmath78 , i.e. to allow for the altered planet - star separation for eccentric orbits .",
    "secondly , the altered planetary velocity should also be incorporated .",
    "w10 propose that a reasonable approximation for the transit duration is obtained by multiplying the smo03 expressions by the following ratio :    @xmath79}{\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}(f_c ) } = \\frac{\\varrho_c}{\\sqrt{1-e^2}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath80 is given in @xcite and @xmath46 is the true anomaly at the centre of the transit .",
    "this yields a new transit duration equation of :    @xmath81^{1/2}\\bigg)\\ ] ]    firstly , we note an obvious improvement of the w10 expression is that we recover the original smo03 equation for @xmath82 .",
    "secondly , comparison to the equation for @xmath55 reveals that the two expressions are very similar except for the position of an extra @xmath83 term .",
    "indeed , the @xmath55 and @xmath84 expressions are equivalent in the small - angle approximation .",
    "insights into the robustness and accuracy of the various expressions may be obtained through numerical tests of the various approximate expressions .",
    "we here compare the accuracy of four expressions : @xmath85 , @xmath84 , @xmath55 and @xmath49 .",
    "these expressions depend only on five parameters @xmath19 , @xmath32 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "one of the clearest ways of visually comparing the equations is to consider a typical transiting exoplanet example with system parameters for @xmath32 and @xmath86 and vary the eccentricity parameters .",
    "@xmath19 may be selected by simply assuming a star of solar density .",
    "we create a 1000 by 1000 grid of @xmath87 and @xmath88 values from -1 to 1 in equal steps .",
    "grid positions for hyperbolic orbits ( @xmath89 ) are excluded .",
    "we then calculate the transit duration through the exact solution of the quartic equation , @xmath90 , plus all four approximate formulae .",
    "we then calculate the fractional deviation of each equation from the true solution using :    @xmath91    we then plot the loci of points for which the deviation is less than 1% ( i.e. @xmath92 ) . in figure 2 , we show four such plots for different choices of @xmath32 and @xmath86 .",
    "the plot reveals several interesting features :    * @xmath55 consistently yields the largest loci .",
    "* @xmath49 is sometimes accurate and sometimes not , supporting the hypothesis that the approximation is not stable .",
    "* @xmath84 also yields consistently large loci .",
    "* @xmath85 consistently yields the smallest loci .",
    "we briefly discuss additional tests we performed for two sets of @xmath93 different hypothetical transiting exoplanet systems ; one for eccentricities @xmath94 and one for @xmath95 . in all cases",
    ", we randomly generated the system parameters weighted by the transit probability and calculated the deviation of the various formulae .",
    "we found that the @xmath55 expressions was consistently the most accurate , with the w10 of similar accuracy but higher assymmetry .",
    "we therefore find that the results yield a overall preference for the @xmath55 approximation .",
    "we note that authors using the @xmath84 formulation can also expect an extremely good approximation but for the remainder of this paper we will only consider using @xmath55 for the later derivations .",
    "we may define the ` improvement ' of the @xmath55 expression relative to the @xmath85 equation as :    @xmath96 * 100\\ ] ]    where @xmath97 is measured in % .",
    "we can see that if ts05 gives a lower deviation ( i.e. more accurate solution ) , we will obtain @xmath98% whereas if the candidate expression gives a closer solution we obtain @xmath99% and is essentially the percentage improvement in accuracy . for the range @xmath100 , we find the mean value of this parameter is @xmath101% and for the range @xmath102 we find @xmath103% .",
    "we note that one caveat of these tests is that they are sensitive to the a priori inputs .    for the case of kepler photometry",
    ", following the method of @xcite , we estimate that the typical measurement uncertainty on @xmath3 will be @xmath1040.1% in most cases .",
    "we find that @xmath55 is accurate to 0.1% or better over a range of @xmath105 and @xmath106 on average .",

    "assuming the transit lightcurve is symmetric ( exactly valid for circular orbits and a very good approximation for eccentric orbits ) , the following relations between these two definitions exist :    @xmath136    for the latter , @xmath137 for the trapezoid approximated lightcurve only .",
    "this is because @xmath3 is defined as when the sky - projection of the planet s centre is touching the stellar limb i.e. @xmath138 . at this point , the fraction of the planetary disc occulting the stellar disc is not equal to one half of the total in - transit occulted area .",
    "in contrast , we here define @xmath4 as the duration between the midway of the ingress to the midway of the egress .",
    "we can intuitionally see at the moment @xmath138 , less than half of the total area must be occulted and therefore @xmath139 .",
    "a further validation of this can be seen by writing down the equations for @xmath1 and @xmath2 and combining them using arcsin trigometric identities . for the simple case of a circular orbit",
    ", the resultant expression would give :    @xmath140^{1/2 } [ 1- \\nonumber \\\\ & ( 1-p^2 ) + b^2]^{1/2 } - [ ( 1-p)^2 - b^2]^{1/2 } [ 1- ( 1+p^2 ) + b^2]^{1/2}\\bigg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it may be shown that @xmath141 and thus @xmath142 . in the same manner as we derived @xmath4 , @xmath5 may also be written as a combination of the relevant arcsin functions .",
    "however , we can already see that such an expression will also be extremely laborius .",
    "this means that writing down the expressions for @xmath143 and @xmath144 is much more challenging than that for @xmath145 and @xmath146 and we were unable to find an exact inversion relation . indeed ,",
    "finding exact expressions for these inverse relations is unncessary as we may retrieve @xmath86 and @xmath31 using equations ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) .    for a circular orbit and in the limit @xmath147",
    ", the relative difference betwen @xmath3 and @xmath4 may be written as :    @xmath148    notice how for @xmath149 this expression yields zero , which is expected since the planet now takes infintessimal size .",
    "the denominator also reveals that the difference diverges rapidly for near - grazing transits i.e. @xmath150 .",
    "the transit lightcurve is essentially described by four physical parameters , which form the parameter set \\{@xmath151 , @xmath155 , @xmath31 , @xmath86}. however , efforts to fit transit lightcurves using this parameter set is known to be highly inefficient due to large inter - parameter correlations , in particular between @xmath31 and @xmath86 .",
    "@xcite used a fisher analysis to show that for a symmetric lightcurve , which is approximated as a piece - wise linear model ( i.e. a trapezoid ) , a superior parameter set to fit for is given by \\{@xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 } where @xmath5 is the ingress or equivalently egress duration assuming a symmetric lightcurve . in our case , these parameters become \\{@xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath55 , @xmath154}. the authors reported that using this parameter set decreased the correlation lengths in a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) fit by a factor of @xmath156 .",
    "in the @xcite analysis , the lightcurve is a symmetric trapezoid and therefore @xmath157 .",
    "as we have already seen , this is not true for a real lightcurve .",
    "this raises the ambiguity as to whether this fitting parameter should be @xmath4 or @xmath3 for real lightcurves .",
    "one advantage of the @xmath3 parameter is that it is independent of @xmath155 , whereas @xmath4 is not . with one degree less of freedom than @xmath4",
    ", @xmath3 will always exhibit lower correlations and may be determined to lower uncertainity .",
    "this makes @xmath3 ideal for transit duration variations ( tdv ) studies , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "however , as we saw in  5.3 , there presently exists no known expression for converting @xmath3 and @xmath5 into the physical parameter set which is used to actually generate a model lightcurve .",
    "when fitting a transit lightcurve , our hypothetical algorithm must make trial guesses for ` the fitting parameter set ' which is then mapped into ` the physical parameter set ' .",
    "these physical parameters are then fed into a transit lightcurve model generator , allowing for the goodness - of - fit between the trial model and the observations to be made .",
    "this mapping proceedure is unavoidable since the transit lightcurve is essentially generated by feeding the sky - projected planet - star separation , @xmath34 , as a function of time , into a lightcurve generating code like that of @xcite .",
    "since @xmath34 ( equation 4 ) is a function of the physical parameter set , and not the fitting parameter set , the mapping between the two sets is a pre - requisite for any lightcurve fitting algorithm .    unless an approximation is made that @xmath158 , there currently exists no expressions which perform this mapping proceedure for the fitting parameter set \\{@xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath55 , @xmath154 } ] .",
    "specifically , there currently exists no exact expression for @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , \\{@xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath55 , @xmath154 } can not be used as a fitting parameter set unless we assume @xmath158 and use \\{@xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 }    fortunately , the consequences of making this assumption will not be severe , in most cases .",
    "this is because the trial fitting parameters serve only one function - to produce trial physical parameters .",
    "these trial physical parameters may be slightly offset from the exact mapping but this is not particularly crippling since the model lightcurve is still generated exactly based upon these trial physical parameters .",
    "the only negative consequence of using this method is that an additional correlation has been introduced into the fitting algorithm since the offset between @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be a function of @xmath86 and @xmath155 .",
    "this correlation will be largest for near - grazing transits since equation ( 47 ) tends towards @xmath161 as @xmath162 .",
    "in general , we wish to avoid such correlations as much as possible to allow the algorithm to most efficiently explore the parameter space .

    "the area of the trapezoid lightcurve is given by @xmath167 where @xmath168 .",
    "the gradient of a trapezoid slope is given by @xmath169 .",
    "since @xmath170 then both @xmath166 and @xmath165 may be written as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 only , thus obviating the use of @xmath3 and the associated issues discussed in the previous subsection .    in order to proceed , a mapping from \\{@xmath165 , @xmath4 , @xmath166 } @xmath171 \\{@xmath155 , @xmath31 , @xmath86 } is required for accomplishing this goal .",
    "the exact solutions for @xmath165 , @xmath4 & @xmath166 may be found by solving the quartic equation discussed in  2 .",
    "however , the roots of this equation yields @xmath172 , @xmath173 & @xmath174 whereas we need the inverse relations . since no concise analytic solution for the inverse relations currently exists",
    ", these inverse relations would have to be calculated through a numerical iteration but such a process would need to be repeated for every single trial leading to vastly greater computation time for a fitting algorithm .",
    "it is critical to understand that using equations for a circular orbit or an approximate eccentric expression of poor accuracy will cause fitting algorithms to wander into unphysical solutions and/or increase inter - parameter correlations for planets which are eccentric , near - grazing , very close - in , etc .",
    "it is therefore imperative to use a mapping which is as accurate as possible in order to have a robust fitting algorithm .",
    "the mappings to convert the trial \\{@xmath163 , @xmath153 , @xmath164 } into the physical parameters \\{@xmath155 , @xmath31 , @xmath86 } are given by equations ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) combined with the following replacements :      we note that the favoured parameter set derived by @xcite assumed a symmetric lightcurve which is not strictly true for @xmath182 .",
    "however , for an eccentric orbit , the degree of assymetry between the ingress and egress is known to be very small ( k08 , w10 ) and thus may be neglected for the purposes of choosing an ideal fitting parameter set .",

    "since we know @xmath153 is a function of @xmath155 but @xmath55 is not , any parameter set using @xmath153 will likely exhibit larger correlations since there is an extra parameter dependency .",
    "however , a parameter set based upon @xmath55 would have to satisfy the condition that it can be inverse mapped into the physical parameters .",
    "@xmath183 , originally defined by @xcite , can be seen to be reciprocal of one half of the transit duration as defined by ts05 . unlike the \\{@xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 } parameter set",
    ", we do not need to assume @xmath137 to produce an inverse mapping . by using @xmath85 and @xmath117 ,",
    "an exact inverse mapping to the physical parameters is possible which offers significant advantages .",
    "having satisfied the criteria of being both a decorrelated parameter and inverseable , @xmath183 would appear to an excellent candidate for lightcurve fitting .",
    "a further improvement to this parameter is possible by using the new @xmath55 approximation for the transit duration .",
    "let us define :            despite the analytic arguments made so far , the clearest validation of which fitting parameter set to employ may be resolved through numerical simulations .",
    "this may be done by considering an example system , generating a lightcurve , adding noise and then refitting using an mcmc routine which outputs the inter - parameter correlations .",
    "we note that analytic expressions for the covariances may be found through fisher information analysis through the calculation of the relevant partial derivatives @xcite .",
    "however , the equations describing the lightcurve , as given by @xcite are quite elaborate and such an analysis remains outside of the scope of this paper .",
    "currently , there exists no exact fisher information analysis in the literature to draw upon .",
    "@xcite avoided this problem by making a trapezoid approximation of the lightcurve and then implementing a fisher analysis .",
    "as discussed earlier , this requires that we assume @xmath187 , which in itself introduces a host of correlations which would be missed by the fisher analysis methodology . therefore , exact numerical testing provides a useful alternative to avoid these issues .",

    "the lightcurve is generated using the @xcite algorithm with no limb - darkening and @xmath192mmag gaussian noise over a 30 second cadence .",
