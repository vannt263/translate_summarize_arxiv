    "in many aspects of human activity , a major desire is to make forecasts for an uncertain future .",
    "consequently , forecasts ought to be probabilistic in nature , taking the form of probability distributions over future quantities or events ( dawid 1984 ; gneiting 2008a ) .",
    "still , many practical situations require single - valued point forecasts , for reasons of decision making , market mechanisms , reporting requirements , communications , or tradition , among others .      in this type of situation ,",
    "competing point forecasters or forecasting procedures are compared and assessed by means of an error measure , such as the absolute error or the squared error , which is averaged over forecast cases .",
    "thus , the performance criterion takes the form @xmath0 where there are @xmath1 forecast cases with corresponding point forecasts , @xmath2 , and verifying observations , @xmath3 . the function",
    "@xmath4 depends both on the forecast and the realization , and we refer to it as a _ scoring function_.    table [ tab : scores ] lists some commonly used scoring functions .",
    "we generally take scoring functions to be _ negatively oriented _ , that is , the smaller , the better . the absolute error and the squared error are of the _ prediction error _ form , in that they depend on the forecast error , @xmath5 , only , and they are _ symmetric _ , in that @xmath6 . the absolute percentage error and the relative error",
    "are used for strictly positive quantities only ; they are neither of the prediction error form nor symmetric .",
    "patton ( 2009 ) discusses these as well as many other scoring functions that have been used to assess point forecasts for a strictly positive quantity , such as an asset value or a volatility proxy .",

    "we call an article a _ forecasting paper _ if it contains a table or a figure in which the predictive performance of a forecaster or forecasting method is summarized in the form of the mean score ( [ eq : s ] ) , or a monotone transformation thereof , such as the root mean squared error . not surprisingly , the majority of the group i papers are forecasting papers , and many of them employ several scoring functions simultaneously .",
    "overall , the squared error is the most popular scoring function in academia , particularly in groups iii and iv , followed by the absolute error and the absolute percentage error .",

    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] develops the notions of consistency and elicitability in a comprehensive way .",
    "in addition to reviewing and unifying the extant literature , we present original results on weighted scoring functions that extend prior findings on optimal point forecasts , such as those of park and stefanski ( 1998 ) and patton ( 2010 ) . section [ sec : examples ] turns to examples .",
    "the mean functional , ratios of expectations , quantiles and expectiles are elicitable .",
    "subject to weak regularity conditions , a scoring function for a real - valued predictand is consistent for the mean functional if and only if it is a bregman function , that is , of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a convex function with subgradient @xmath53 ( savage 1971 ) .",
    "more general and novel results apply to ratios of expectations and expectiles .",
    "a scoring function is consistent for the @xmath54-quantile if and only if it is generalized piecewise linear ( gpl ) of order @xmath55 , that is , of the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes an indicator function and @xmath58 is nondecreasing ( thomson 1979 ; saerens 2000 ) .",
    "however , not all functionals are elicitable .",
    "notably , the conditional value - at - risk ( cvar ) functional is not elicitable , despite its popularity as a risk measure in financial applications .",
    "the paper closes with a discussion in section [ sec : discussion ] , which makes a plea for change in the practice of point forecasting .",
    "i contend that in issuing and evaluating point forecasts , it is essential that either the scoring function be specified ex ante , or an elicitable target functional be named , such as an expectation or a quantile , and scoring functions be used that are consistent for the target functional .",
    "we now develop a theoretical framework for the evaluation of point forecasts . towards this end",
    ", we review the more general , classical decision - theoretic setting whose basic ingredients are as follows .    1 .   an _ observation domain _ , @xmath59 , which comprises the potential outcomes of a future observation .",
    "2 .   a class @xmath60 of probability measures on the observation domain @xmath59 ( equipped with a suitable @xmath61-algebra ) , which constitutes a family of probability distributions for the future observation .",
    "3 .   an _ action domain _ , @xmath62 , which comprises the potential actions of a decision maker .",
    "4 .   a _ loss function _",
    "@xmath63 , where @xmath64 represents the monetary or societal cost when the decision maker takes the action @xmath65 and the observation @xmath66 materializes .    given a probability distribution @xmath67 for the future observation , the _",
    "bayes act _ or _",
    "bayes rule _ is any decision @xmath68 such that @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a random variable with distribution @xmath24 .",
    "thus , if the decision maker s assessment of the uncertain future is represented by the probability measure @xmath24 , and she wishes to minimize the expected loss , her optimal decision is the bayes act , @xmath71 . in general ,",
    "bayes acts need not exist nor be unique , but in most cases of practical interest , bayes rules exist , and frequently they are unique ( ferguson 1967 ) .",
    "point forecasting falls into the general decision - theoretic setting , if we assume that the observation domain and the action domain coincide . in what follows we assume , for simplicity , that this common domain , @xmath72 is a subset of the euclidean space @xmath73 and equipped with the corresponding borel @xmath61-algebra .",
    "furthermore , we refer to the loss function as a scoring function . with these adaptations ,",
    "the basic components of our decision - theoretic framework are as follows .    1 .   a _ prediction - observation _ ( po ) _ domain _ , @xmath74 , which is the cartesian product of the domain @xmath75 with itself .",
    "2 .   a family @xmath60 of potential probability distributions for the future observation",
    "@xmath70 that takes values in @xmath76 .",
    "3 .   a _ scoring function _ @xmath77 , where @xmath78 represents the loss or pe- nalty when the point forecast @xmath79 is issued and the observation @xmath80 materializes .    in this",
    "setting , the _ optimal point forecast _ under the probability distribution @xmath67 for the future observation , @xmath70 , is the bayes act or bayes rule ( [ eq : bayes.act ] ) , which can now be written as @xmath81 we will mostly work in dimension @xmath82 , in which any connected domain @xmath76 is simply an interval , @xmath41 .",

    "the nonnegativity condition ( s0 ) is standard and not restrictive .",
    "indeed , if @xmath89 is such that @xmath90 for all @xmath91 , which is a natural assumption on a loss or scoring function , then @xmath92 satisfies ( s0 ) and shares the optimal point forecast ( [ eq : bayes.rule ] ) , subject to integrability conditions that are not of practical concern . generally , a loss function can be multiplied by a strictly positive constant and any function that depends on @xmath93 only can be added , without changing the nature of the optimal point forecast .",
    "furthermore , the optimization problem in ( [ eq : bayes.rule ] ) is posed in terms of the point predictor , @xmath86 . in this light , it is natural that assumptions ( s1 ) and ( s2 ) concern continuity and differentiability with respect to the first argument , the point forecast @xmath86 .",
    "efron ( 1991 ) and patton ( 2010 ) argue that _ homogeneity _ or _ scale invariance _ is a desirable property of a scoring function . we adopt this notion and call a scoring function @xmath4 on the po domain @xmath74 _ homogeneous _ of _ order _",

    "lambert et al .  (",

    "( 2008 ) consider @xmath76 to be a finite set .",
    "the work of granger and pesaran ( 2000a , 2000b ) , which argues in favor of closer links between decision theory and forecast evaluation , focuses on probability forecasts for a dichotomous event .      in the decision - theoretic framework",

    "it is _ strictly consistent _ if it is consistent and equality in ( [ eq : consistent ] ) implies that @xmath109 .",
    "_    as noted , the term consistent was coined by murphy and daan ( 1985 , p.  391 ) , who stressed that is is critically important to define consistency for a fixed , given functional , as opposed to a generic notion of consistency , which was , correctly , refuted by jolliffe ( 2008 ) .",
    "for example , the squared error scoring function , @xmath110 , is consistent , but not strictly consistent , for the mean functional relative to the class of the probability measures on the real line with finite first moment .",
    "it is strictly consistent relative to the class of the probability measures with finite second moment .    in a parametric context ,",
    "lehmann ( 1951 ) and noorbaloochi and meeden ( 1983 ) refer to a related property as _ decision - theoretic unbiasedness_. the following result notes that consistency is the dual of the optimal point forecast property , just as decision - theoretic unbiasedness is the dual of being bayes ( noorbaloochi and meeden 1983 ) .",
    "it thus connects the problems of finding optimal point forecasts , and of evaluating point predictions .",

    "our next result shows that the class of the consistent scoring functions is convex , and thus suggests the existence of choquet representations ( phelps 1966 ) .",

    "i believe that this distinction is useful , even though the extant literature has failed to make it .",
    "for example , in referring to proper scoring rules for quantile forecasts , cervera and muoz ( 1996 ) , gneiting and raftery ( 2007 ) , hilden ( 2008 ) and jose and winkler ( 2009 ) discuss scoring functions that are consistent for a quantile .    within our decision - theoretic framework ,",

    "the loss or penalty @xmath121 arises when a probabilistic forecaster issues the predictive distribution @xmath24 while @xmath80 materializes .",
    "the expectation inequality ( [ eq : proper ] ) then implies that the forecaster minimizes the expected loss by following her true beliefs .",
    "thus , the use of proper scoring rules encourages sincerity and candor among probabilistic forecasters .",
    "in contrast , a scoring function @xmath4 acts on the po domain , @xmath98 , that is , the cartesian product of @xmath76 with itself . this is a much simpler domain than that for a scoring rule .",
    "however , any consistent scoring function induces a proper scoring rule in a straightforward and natural construction , as follows .",
    "[ th : proper ] suppose that the scoring function @xmath4 is consistent for the functional @xmath46 relative to the class @xmath60 .",

    "ideally , forecasts ought to be probabilistic , taking the form of predictive distributions over future quantities and events ( dawid 1984 ; diebold et al .  1998 ; granger and pesaran 2000a , 2000b ; gneiting 2008a ) .",
    "if point forecasts are to be issued and evaluated , it is essential that either the scoring function be specified ex ante , or an elicitable target functional be named , such as the mean or a quantile of the predictive distribution , and scoring functions be used that are consistent for the target functional .    our plea for the use of consistent scoring functions supplements and qualifies , but does not contradict , extant recommendations in the forecasting literature , such as those of armstrong ( 2001 ) , jolliffe and stephenson ( 2003 ) and fildes and goodwin ( 2007 ) .",
    "for example , fildes and goodwin ( 2007 ) propose forecasting principles for organizations , the eleventh of which suggests that `` multiple measures of forecast accuracy '' be employed .",

    "we have developed theory for the notions of consistency and elicitability , and have characterized the classes of the loss or scoring functions that result in expectations , ratios of expectations , quantiles or expectiles as optimal point forecasts .",
    "some of these results are classical , such as those for means and quantiles ( savage 1971 ; thomson 1979 ) , while others are original , including a disconcerting negative result , in that scoring functions which are consistent for the cvar functional do not exist .    in the case of the mean functional , the consistent scoring functions are the bregman functions of the form ( [ eq : bregman ] ) . among these , a particularly attractive choice is the patton family ( [ eq : patton ] ) of homogeneous scoring functions , which nests the squared error ( se ) and qlike functions . in evaluating volatility forecasts ,",
    "patton and sheppard ( 2009 ) recommend the use of the latter because of its superior power in diebold and mariano ( 1995 ) and west ( 1996 ) tests of predictive ability , which depend on differences between mean scores of the form ( [ eq : s ] ) as test statistics .",
    "further work in this direction is desirable , both empirically and theoretically",
    ". if quantile forecasts are to be assessed , the consistent scoring functions are the gpl functions of the form ( [ eq : gpl ] ) , with the homogeneous power functions in ( [ eq : gpl.b ] ) being appealing examples .",
    "interestingly , the scoring functions that are consistent for expectiles combine key elements of the bregman and gpl families .    as regards the most commonly used scoring functions in academia , businesses and organizations , the squared error scoring function is consistent for the mean , and the absolute error scoring function for the median .",
    "the absolute percentage error scoring function , which is commonly used by businesses and organizations , and occasionally in academia , is consistent for a non - standard functional , namely , the median of order @xmath301 , @xmath302 , which tends to support severe underforecasts , as compared to the mean or median .",
    "it thus seems prudent that businesses and organizations consider the intended or unintended consequences and reassess its suitability as a scoring function .",

    "similarly , if multiple scoring functions are to be used in the evaluation , and the scoring functions are consistent for distinct functionals , participants ought to be allowed to submit possibly distinct point forecasts .    while thus far we have addressed forecasting or prediction problems , similar issues arise when the goal is estimation .",

    "similarly , bregman functions of the original form ( [ eq : bregman ] ) and of the variant in ( [ eq : bregman.tau ] ) could be employed in generalizing symmetric and asymmetric least squares regression .    in applied settings ,",

    "<S> single - valued point forecasts continue to be issued and used in almost all realms of science and society . typically , competing point forecasters or forecasting procedures are compared and assessed by means of an error measure or scoring function , such as the absolute error or the squared error , that depends both on the point forecast and the realizing observation . </S>",
    "<S> the individual scores are then averaged over forecast cases , to result in a summary measure of the predictive performance , such as the mean absolute error or the ( root ) mean squared error . </S>",
    "<S> i demonstrate that this common practice can lead to grossly misguided inferences , unless the scoring function and the forecasting task are carefully matched .    </S>",
    "<S> effective point forecasting requires that the scoring function be specified a priori , or that the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a statistical functional , such as the mean or a quantile of the predictive distribution . </S>",
    "<S> if the scoring function is specified a priori , the forecaster can issue an optimal point forecast , namely , the bayes rule , which minimizes the expected loss under the forecaster s predictive distribution . if the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a functional , it is critical that the scoring function be consistent for it , in the sense that the expected score is minimized when following the directive . </S>",
    "<S> any consistent scoring function induces a proper scoring rule for probabilistic forecasts , and a duality principle links bayes rules and consistent scoring functions .    </S>",
    "<S> a functional is elicitable if there exists a scoring function that is strictly consistent for it . </S>",
    "<S> expectations , ratios of expectations and quantiles are elicitable . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a scoring function is consistent for the mean functional if and only if it is a bregman function . </S>",
    "<S> it is consistent for a quantile if and only if it is generalized piecewise linear . </S>",
    "<S> similar characterizations apply to ratios of expectations and to expectiles . </S>",
    "<S> weighted scoring functions are consistent for functionals that adapt to the weighting in peculiar ways . </S>",
