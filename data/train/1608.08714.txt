    "furthermore , the strong lyman continuum radiation from the ob and wr stars in the central cluster ionizes rapidly in the region ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . a resent dust observation of the gcms with alma suggested that there is a possible scenario for the formation of the central cluster : a star - forming molecular cloud is falling from a region somewhat far from sgr a@xmath5 and supplies young stars and the ism to the vicinity of sgr a@xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "this is presumably the positive velocity end of the bar .",
    "the ea is also a conspicuous continuum substructure of the gcms ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the ionized gas streamer corresponding to the ea has complicated velocity structures .",
    "the negative velocity end of the streamer appears as a peak component apparently connecting to the bar in the panel of @xmath66 km s@xmath24 in figure 2 .",
    "the component extends along the ea in the panels of @xmath67 km s@xmath24 and reaches at least up to @xmath68 .",
    "the peak of the component seems to shift to west with going to positive velocity in the panels of @xmath69 km s@xmath24 .",

    "the velocity width increases around the south end .",
    "we also see the feature in the position - velocity diagram along the bar ( see figure 4b ) .",
    "the ea apparently overlaps with the bar in the diagrams , but this is presumably coincidence in the line - of sight by chance .",
    "another ionized gas streamer is seen @xmath72 north of the ea ( see figure 1 ) and is called  northeastern arm ( nea ) \" hereafter . the nea is also identified in the panels of @xmath73 km s@xmath24 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the nea appears to cross at the north end of the ea around @xmath74 ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "the positive velocity end of the ionized gas is seen as an elongated source between the na and the ea in the panel of @xmath77 km s@xmath24 .",
    "however , the inner end of the nea does not appear to reach to the vicinity of sgr a@xmath2 .",
    "the inner end corresponds to the group of half - shell like sources found by jvla at 34 ghz ( @xcite ) , which is discussed in section 4 .",
    "there is an ionized gas corresponding to the western arc ( wa ) ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the component with the most negative velocity appears at the south end in the panel of @xmath78 km s@xmath24 .",
    "the intensity peak goes to north along the wa with increasing velocity from @xmath78 km s@xmath24 to @xmath79 km s@xmath24 .",
    "figure 4d shows the position - velocity diagram along the wa .",
    "the inclined linear feature crosses the point of @xmath79 km s@xmath24 and @xmath80 offset in the diagram .",
    "this suggests that the wa is a part of a nearly circular orbiting ring ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the component of the wa with @xmath81 km s@xmath24 appears to cross the bar ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the bar is also seen as a vertical linear feature at the angular offset of @xmath56 from sgr a@xmath18 in figure 4d .",
    "because both components cross at nearly right angle , the wa would be not physically associated with the bar .",
    "there is a molecular gas component of the cnd along the outer boundary of the wa ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the molecular gas has the same velocity to the ionized gas component of the wa .",
    "thus , it is very likely that the ionized gas component is physically associated with the molecular gas component .",
    "meanwhile there is another molecular gas component of the cnd in the velocity range from @xmath76 km s@xmath24 to @xmath82 km s@xmath24 , which is located along the wa in appearance ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is no ionized gas counterpart in such velocity range .",
    "although the ionized gas in the gcms should not be bounded by self gravity , as in the case of hii regions in the galactic disk , the ionized gas would be seen to move along its keplerien orbit considerably .",
    "this is because the expansion of the ionized gas with a thermal velocity of @xmath83 km s@xmath24 is very slow compared to the keplerien orbital motion with a velocity of @xmath84 km s@xmath24 except near the apoastron : the ionized gas can expands up to at most 1 pc within one orbital period .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the ionized gas streamer corresponding to the bar is identified as an inclined linear ridge with large velocity width features at both the velocity ends on the position - velocity diagram along the bar ( see figure 4b ) .",
    "the kinematic characteristics of the streamer suggest that this is a part of a component with a nearly keplerien orbit around the gcbh , of which the major axis should be nearly parallel to the line - of - sight .",
    "position - velocity diagrams of keplerian orbits with high eccentricity are calculated in appendix .",
    "as shown in figure 8 , the kinematic characteristics seen in figure 4b are reproduced only in the case of @xmath85 . because the ionized gas streamer can not be confined to a single orbit and",
    "the gas distribution is not homogeneous , it is not easy to derive the orbital parameters accurately from the characteristics of the streamer on the position - velocity diagram .",
    "however , the orbit probably has a very high eccentricity , such as @xmath86 , based on the simulated position - velocity diagrams .",
    "the semi - minor axis of the orbit is expected to be @xmath87 pc from the angular extent on the position - velocity diagram of figure 4b , @xmath88 .",
    "the semi - major axis and period of the orbit with @xmath86 are @xmath89 pc and @xmath90 years , respectively .",
    "then the periastron distance from the gcbh and the orbiting velocity at the periastron are estimated to be @xmath91 pc and @xmath92 km s@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the radial velocities at the maximum angular offsets , @xmath88 , are estimated to be @xmath93 km s@xmath24 .",
    "these are actually seen on the position - velocity diagram .",
    "in addition , the matter in the orbit may be affect the feeding process of the x - ray emitting hot plasma to the gcbh because the expected periastron is located within the bondi accretion radius , @xmath94 pc , which is derived from x - ray observations by chandra ( @xcite ) .    a faint component with extremely negative velocities of @xmath95 km s@xmath24 is identified at @xmath96 ( see figure 5 ) , which corresponds to @xmath97 ( @xmath98pc ) south - southwest of sgr a@xmath2 and also corresponds to @xmath99 east of the most negative velocity component ( @xmath100 km s@xmath24 ) of the na mentioned in the previous section ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "note that a faint component seen at the position of sgr a * is probably a residual in the continuum subtraction process by casa .",
    "the ir counterpart of the faint component has been identified in sinfoni observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the component is apparently located within the bondi accretion radius . assuming a circular keplerian orbit around sgr a@xmath2 , the orbital velocity is estimated to be @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the inclination or the angle between the line - of - sight and the normal of the orbital plane . because the observed radial velocity is consistent with the orbital velocity estimated for a circular keplerian orbit with @xmath103 , @xmath104 km s@xmath24 , the physical distance from the gcbh of the component should be close to the projected distance .",
    "the observed radial velocity is also consistent with a free fall velocity ( @xmath105 km s@xmath24 ) from @xmath106 pc , i.e. , the outer end of the gcms , to the observed position with @xmath107 .",
    "this component may be a tip of another streamer approaching to the gcbh .",

    "the protostar candidates detected in the 34-ghz continuum map are concentrated exclusively in the ionized gas streamer of the nea traced by the h42@xmath0 recombination line .",

    ", the tidal force of sgr a@xmath5 and the strong lyman continuum radiation from the central cluster must suppress the star - formation activity near sgr a@xmath2 .",
    "the positional correlation in figure 7 suggests that the protostar candidates had formed in the nea when it was located in the outer region and they were brought to near sgr a@xmath2 according as the streamer falls . if a star - forming molecular cloud falls from an outer region and supplies young stars to the vicinity of sgr a@xmath5 , the obstacles to the star - formation activity near sgr a@xmath2 should be overcome .",

    "there is a good positional correlation between the protostar candidates detected by jvla at 34 ghz and the ionized gas streamer found in the north of the ea by the h42@xmath0 recombination line observation .",
