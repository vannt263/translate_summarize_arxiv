    "in this paper we study the osmotic pressure of a suspension of charged colloids or polyelectrolytes in osmotic equilibrium with an electrolyte of given composition . examples of such systems abound in our everyday life .",
    "they occur as dispersion paints , viscosity modifiers , flocculants , or superabsorbers , to name but a few technological applications @xcite .",
    "they also play a tremendous role in molecular biology , since virtually all proteins in every living cell , as well as the dna molecule itself , are charged macromolecules dissolved in salty water @xcite .",
    "a great deal of experimental and theoretical research has been devoted to their understanding , and several good textbooks @xcite and review articles @xcite are available .",
    "arguably the most fundamental thing to know about these suspensions is their equation of state , @xmath1 , how the ( osmotic ) pressure depends on other thermodynamic variables like macromolecular charge or concentration . within the last hundred years",
    "several ingenious ways have been conceived for treating this problem on varying levels of sophistication . in this article",
    "we will be concerned with poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory in combination with a cell model approximation for the macroion correlations , which we briefly revisit in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] .",
    "while this does not present the highest level of accuracy or sophistication , it is probably the simplest and up to today single most important starting point ; it offers a benchmark against which all other theories are compared .",
    "indeed , we believe that modern improvements can only be fully appreciated once one understands the successes and failures of the most fundamental mean field theories .    since the nonlinear pb equation can be solved analytically only in very few cases @xcite , its linearized version has always been an important substitute .",
    "however , the freedom to choose an expansion point and its subsequent impact on the range of validity and accuracy of the linearization has often gone unnoticed . moreover , the computation of _ thermodynamic _ properties from the ionic _ profiles _ computed in linear theory is often based on expressions from the nonlinear pb theory or expansions thereof @xcite .",
    "this procedure is by no means unique and invariably entails internal inconsistencies .",
    "both these points make it virtually impossible to conclude whether any failures of linearized pb theory are real deficiencies or avoidable side - effects of a non - optimal or inconsistent linearization .    in this paper",
    "we resolve these issues by giving a coherent presentation of linearized pb theory which illuminates the subtle interrelations between the donnan equilibrium , microion screening , linearization and the osmotic pressure . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lpb ] we utilize the functional approach to pb theory @xcite and generalize its quadratic expansion @xcite , arriving at a functional which yields the pb equation linearized about the electrostatic potential value @xmath2 .",
    "this expansion point will turn out to lie at the heart of all those interrelations . for general @xmath2",
    "we then derive in sec .",
    "[ sec : pressure ] an analytical formula for the pressure in terms of the ionic profiles .",
    "our novel expression replaces the famous boundary density rule @xcite from nonlinear pb theory , according to which the osmotic pressure of the suspension is given by the value of the microion density at the outer cell boundary . that this does not hold in _ linearized",
    "_ theory may be considered as one of the major results of the present work .",
    "the most common choice of the linearization point @xmath2  namely , the potential value in the salt reservoir  suffers from several drawbacks , as this value can be very different from the average electrostatic potential @xmath3 in the colloidal suspension , and it seems more reasonable to selfconsistently linearize about the latter @xcite .",
    "we investigate this choice in sec .",
    "[ sec : psibb ] and will prove that it is indeed optimal  in the sense that ( @xmath4 ) charge screening rests on the actual ionic strength , such that ( @xmath5 ) the crossover between counterion- and salt - screening is naturally included and ( @xmath6 ) the limit of large volume fraction is correctly reproduced . in brief , all zeroth order effects of the donnan - equilibrium are already incorporated by the mere choice of the linearization point , and the linearized equation now describes higher order effects .",
    "we will also see that ( @xmath7 ) all other choices of the linearization point overestimate the donnan effect in lowest order , since they violate a rigorous inequality from pb theory for the salt content in the colloidal suspension .",
    "based on this optimal linearization scheme we then derive explicit analytical formulas for the osmotic pressure of suspensions of charged mesoscopic objects in sec .",
    "[ sec : explicit ] .",
    "these formulas hold for spherical , cylindrical and planar shapes and should thus be useful in a broad variety of possible systems .",
    "the subsequent section  [ sec : examples ] is devoted to comparing their predictions with the full nonlinear pb theory .    within full pb theory",
    "the pressure is always positive .",
    "whether or not this also holds in the linearized theory depends both on the choice of the linearization point @xmath2 as well as on the precise definition of the pressure itself .",
    "we prove that the pressure is always positive for symmetric electrolytes if one treats @xmath2 as an independent variable . if one does not , the pressure can become negative at low volume fractions @xcite .",
    "the implied liquid - gas coexistence  not being present on the nonlinear level  is thus clearly an artifact . as a striking example",
    "we show that even a solution of dna molecules under physiological conditions would be predicted to phase separate at all relevant densities .",
    "in this section we start by introducing the physical situation we wish to describe  namely , the donnan equilibrium  and its theoretical description in terms of a cell model . pb theory is founded on its grand potential functional , and a brief derivation for the pressure ( leading to the boundary density rule ) is presented .      .",
    "the mesoscopic objects are depicted as spherical ( as appropriate for instance for `` conventional '' charged colloids or micelles ) , but our discussion will be more general and also apply to cylindrical entities ( @xmath0 dna , actin filaments , tmv viruses ) or planar objects ( @xmath0  charged membranes , clay particles ) . ]",
    "we study a suspension of charged mesoscopic objects ( henceforth simply referred to as `` colloids '' ) dialyzed against a salt reservoir of given composition , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "this situation is traditionally referred to as a `` donnan membrane equilibrium '' @xcite .",
    "much of our discussion will not depend on the shape of the colloids , and our final explicit formulas will be valid for spherical , cylindrical and planar geometries .",
    "even though the microions can traverse the membrane , their average concentration differs between the salt reservoir and the colloid compartment , since the latter is already occupied by the counterions originating from the macroions , which can not leave the compartment due to the constraint of global electroneutrality .",
    "this imbalance in average densities generates an osmotic pressure difference which the membrane has to sustain and which we wish to calculate in the following .    for simplicity",
    "we assume the reservoir to be sufficiently large such that its ionic strength remains unchanged after being brought in contact with the macroion solution .",
    "this assumption is not necessary , but simplifies our discussion of general theoretical issues .",
    "how it can be avoided is demonstrated in ref .",
    "we also note that we will not describe the solvent explicitly but rather replace it by a continuum with relative dielectric constant @xmath8 .",
    "theoretical concepts like the cell - model or pb theory have long become standard tools , so we will restrict ourselves to a brief description and only provide the basic equations  essentially in order to introduce our notation and terminology .",

    "the cell model approximation attempts to reduce the complicated many particle problem of interacting charged colloids and microions to an effective one - colloid - problem .",
    "it rests on the observation that at not too low volume fractions the colloids  due to mutual repulsion  arrange their positions such that each colloid has a region around it which is void from other colloids and which looks rather similar for different colloids .",
    "in other words , the wigner - seitz cells around two colloids are comparable in shape and volume .",
    "one now assumes that ( @xmath4 ) the total charge within each cell is exactly zero , ( @xmath5 ) all cells have the same shape and ( @xmath6 ) for actual calculations one may approximate this shape such that it matches the symmetry of the colloid ( for instance , spherical cells around spherical colloids ) .",
    "if the radius of the colloids is @xmath9 , the cell radius @xmath10 is chosen such that @xmath11 equals the volume fraction occupied by the colloids . here",
    ", @xmath12 measures the `` dimensionality '' of the colloid in the sense that @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 corresponds to planar , cylindrical and spherical colloids .",
    "if one ( @xmath7 ) neglects interactions between different cells , the partition function finally factorizes in the macroion coordinates , @xmath1 , the thermodynamic potential of the whole suspension is equal to the number of cells times the thermodynamic potential of one cell",
    ".    within each cell the small ions assume some inhomogeneous distribution which arises from their interactions with themselves as well as with the charged colloid .",
    "computing the corresponding partition function is impracticable , since all ions are strongly correlated with each other .",
    "poisson - boltzmann theory is the mean - field route to circumventing precisely this problem .",
    "a very powerful way to formulate it starts from a thermodynamic potential functional belonging to the appropriate ensemble  which in our case is the grand canonical one : @xmath16 the meaning of the symbols is as follows : @xmath17 is the inverse thermal energy ; @xmath18 is the local electrostatic potential ( made dimensionless by multiplication with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the positive unit charge ) ; the potential is generated by both the fixed charge density @xmath21 ( located for instance on the colloid surface ) as well as the distributions @xmath22 of mobile ions of species @xmath4 , which have a signed valence @xmath23 and a chemical potential @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the thermal de broglie wavelength of the small ions ; and the region of integration , @xmath26 , is understood to be the space within one cell that is actually accessible to the small ions .",

    "@xcite and references therein ) , but this need not give a unique functional @xcite and ( once @xmath33 has been identified with the grand potential ) appears like an upside - down explanation for the key initial equation ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) .",
    "however , pb theory can be well justified by deriving the functional ( [ eq : omega ] ) from the underlying _",
    "hamiltonian_. for instance , it can be obtained as the saddle point of the field theoretic action @xcite , as a density functional reformulation of the partition function combined with a first order cumulant expansion of the correlation term @xcite , or from the gibbs - bogoljubov inequality applied to a trial product state @xcite .",
    "those approaches also show that pb theory provides an upper bound of the exact thermodynamic potential .",
    "one advantage of the thermodynamic functional approach to pb theory is that it becomes immediately clear what the pressure is  in the present ensemble the derivative of the grand potential  ( [ eq : omega_eq ] ) with respect to the volume .",
    "it proves convenient to rewrite this in terms of the _ functional _ ( [ eq : omega ] ) , which can be achieved as follows .",
    "the variation upon some change in volume can be decomposed into the `` orthogonal '' changes @xmath34 where the first term contains any explicit dependence on the volume ( at fixed ion profiles ) and the second part is the implicit dependence through the ion profiles ( at fixed volume ) .",
    "however , since the equilibrium distributions make the grand potential functional stationary with respect to variations of the density profile at fixed cell geometry , the implicit terms vanish .",
    "hence , the pressure is just the negative derivative of the grand potential _ functional _ with respect to the cell volume , _ evaluated at the equilibrium profile_. the derivative @xmath35 is understood to imply a movement of the outer neutral cell boundary , which shall be located at @xmath36 , and which only occurs in the boundaries of the volume integral in eqn .",

    "the latter is obtained with comparative ease , since the electrolyte is homogeneous and hence the route via a density functional is unnecessary . on the same level of approximation as above it",

    "often the pressure has been computed ( without much justification ) by using the predictions of the linearized pb equation in formulas of the nonlinear theory ( or expansions thereof ) ; moreover , this recourse to the full theory is not unique and hence prone to inconsistencies .",
    "these problems are avoided by starting from the appropriate thermodynamic potential functional of linear theory , which however still leaves two alternative definitions for the pressure that differ in their treatment of a possible volume dependence of the linearization point .",
    "neither definition predicts the pressure to be proportional to the density of microions at the outer cell boundary , @xmath1 , the well known result from nonlinear pb theory does not apply on the linearized level .",
    "all this can be discussed without fixing the expansion point , but optimality considerations nevertheless suggest a specific choice for it .",
    "explicit formulas can be obtained , since the linearized pb equation can be solved analytically for general cell models .",
    "let us thus sumarize the key findings of this work :    \\(a ) linearized pb theory can be based on a density functional which is the quadratic expansion of the well known functional of nonlinear pb theory .",
    "the choice of the expansion point distinguishes different linearization schemes .",
    "the equilibrium value of this functional is the thermodynamic potential , in our case the grand potential .",
    "\\(b ) the pressure is given by the volume derivative of this thermodynamic potential . there is a choice as to whether or not one would like to keep the linearization point fixed , resulting in two different pressure definitions both based on the thermodynamic potential .",
    "\\(c ) the boundary density rule ( [ eq : p_pb_n ] ) from nonlinear pb theory is replaced by the quadratic expansion of the nonlinear formula in the boundary potential .",
    "\\(d ) the range of validity of linearization depends on the expansion point .",
    "we proved that linearization about the selfconsistently determined average potential is optimal  in the sense that it automatically describes the donnan effect correctly in lowest order , leaving the linearized pb equation to incorporate higher order corrections .",
    "furthermore , we showed that all other linearization schemes violate an important inequality from nonlinear pb theory related directly to the donnan effect .",
    "\\(e ) the linearized pb equation can be solved exactly for symmetric cell models of arbitrary dimension , salt reservoir composition and linearization point .",
    "we used this solution to derive explicit formulas for the pressure and have discussed their analytical properties in detail .",
    "\\(f ) a comparison with the results from nonlinear pb theory has been performed , showing that the validity of linearization depends strongly on the linearization point .",
    "while the traditional linearization scheme completely fails to describe the important limit of large volume fraction , the optimal ( donnan- ) linearization becomes asymptotically correct there .",
    "\\(g ) for pressure definition ( [ eq : p_psi_2 ] ) , @xmath1  the _ total _ volume derivative of the grand potential , negative pressures and compressibilities can occur .",
    "these findings have previously been taken as indications of a gas - liquid phase separation in suspensions of spherical colloids . in the present work we showed that the same theoretical reasoning would predict dna to phase separate under physiological conditions at all relevant concentrations .",
    "we consider this as a further striking argument against the genuineness of the transition .",
    "\\(h ) in nonlinear pb theory the pressure is always positive .",
    "whether or not this still holds on the linearized level depends crucially on the precise definition of the pressure itself .",
    "it is for this reason that we advocate defining the pressure via the _ partial _ derivative of the grand potential with respect to the volume ( @xmath1 , keeping in particular the linearization point fixed ) , since the pressure is then always positive for symmetric electrolytes  in agreement with nonlinear pb theory .",
    "md would like to thank m.  tamashiro , i.  borukhov , and h.wennerstrm for stimulating discussions or clarifying comments during the development of this work .",
    "he also gratefully acknowledges financial support by the german science foundation ( dfg ) under grant de775/1 - 1 .",
    "hhvg gratefully acknowledges intensive discussions with r.  klein and r.  van roij .",
    "consider a cell model in @xmath12 dimensions with generalized radial coordinate @xmath185 .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 corresponds to planar , cylindrical and spherical macroions , respectively .",
    "after the transformation @xmath186 and @xmath187 the linearized pb equation ( [ eq : lpb ] ) reads @xmath188 where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath189 .",
    "henceforth we will not bother with the difference between @xmath190 and @xmath191 and omit the tilde .",
    "an obvious particular solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : pblinde ] ) is @xmath192 , while the homogeneous equation is solved by the ansatz @xmath193 with @xmath194 , provided @xmath195 solves the bessel equation @xmath196 .",
    "two linearly independent solutions are the modified bessel functions @xmath197 and @xmath198 @xcite . the general solution of the differential equation ( [ eq : pblinde ] ) can therefore be written as @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 are constants to be determined by the following boundary conditions .",
    "gauss law relates the radial derivative of the electrostatic potential at @xmath202 to the surface charge density @xmath203 of the macroion .",
    "if we define the latter to be the total charge of the macroion divided by its surface area , we have @xmath204 .",
    "since the whole cell is neutral , we also have @xmath205 at the outer cell radius @xmath206 .",
    "the integration constants now follow from inserting these boundary conditions into the general solution . after a little algebra",
    "we then find the potential @xmath207 ,    \\label{eq : fvl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the determinant @xmath121 is defined as @xmath208 we have @xmath209 since @xmath210 .    at the outer boundary the potential ( [ eq : fvl ] )",
    "can be further simplified .",
    "the term in angular brackets reduces to @xmath211 , and using the volume fraction @xmath64 the surface charge density can be rewritten in terms of the colloid charge as @xmath212 . inserting the definitions ( [ eq : kappab ] ) for @xmath51 we arrive at @xmath213 equation ( [ eq : psi(r ) ] )",
    "gives the boundary potential in linearized pb theory for a general @xmath12-dimensional cell model with arbitrary linearization point @xmath2 and electrolyte composition .",
