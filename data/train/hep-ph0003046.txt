    "the past decade of precision electroweak experiments has seen outstanding confirmation of the standard model at the per mille level .",
    "but the successes of the standard model have drawn increased attention to its deficiencies , notably its unsatisfactory treatment of the mechanism behind electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this phenomenon occurs roughly at the 1  tev scale , which the lhc will access directly .",
    "the merits of any additional machine must therefore be evaluated within the context of the lhc program .",
    "a tev - scale  linear collider ( lc ) is a leading candidate for such a facility .",
    "such a machine offers control over the beam energy and polarization , and a clean environment that enables precision event reconstruction . in this paper",
    "i illustrate aspects of the lc physics program with examples drawn from higgs physics , top quark physics , and the study of large extra spacetime dimensions .",
    "more comprehensive reviews of physics at @xmath0 linear colliders are given in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "well - developed lc designs have been put forward by the slac - kek joint effort ( the nlc / jlc designs)@xcite and by desy ( the tesla design)@xcite .",
    "the two machines differ technologically but achieve similar ends .",
    "the nlc uses warm rf cavities operating in the x - band ( 11.4 ghz ) .",
    "the baseline design assumes initial operation at @xmath1  gev at a luminosity of @xmath2  @xmath3s@xmath4 , with an @xmath5 beam polarization of 80 - 90% .",
    "the linac is designed to allow adiabatic energy upgrades to @xmath6  tev through the addition of klystrons .",
    "the size of the beam - delivery and final focus systems would allow eventual operation at 1.5 tev .",
    "the tesla design uses superconducting rf operating at @xmath7  ghz , and reaches a center of mass energy of 800 - 1000  gev .",
    "initial operation would be in the 200 - 500 gev range , with an @xmath5 polarization of 80% as well as a positron beam polarization of 60% , which would introduce new measureables into physics processes . this design permits operation at very high luminosity , up to @xmath8  @xmath3s@xmath4 .",
    "the two designs have rather different beam characteristics and time structures . a brief comparison of the tesla and nlc parameters is shown in table  [ tab : machines ] ; a more complete list can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    designing a detector for a linear collider",
    "is widely regarded , at least by those who work at hadron colliders , as an easy problem .",
    "certainly the lc does not share the lhc s formidable challenges of high event rates and radiation exposures .",
    "the challenges for a linear collider detector stem from the desire to fully exploit the clean machine environment by building a detector of the highest possible precision .",
    "current designs are evolutionary extensions of the lep and sld detectors and feature ccd pixel vertex detectors , silicon or tpc outer trackers , and a fine - grained em calorimeter located inside the magnet coil .",
    "several designs incorporate the hadronic calorimeter inside the coil as well .",
    "in contrast to the lhc where triggering is a major challenge , at a linear collider the full detector can be read out between bunch trains and triggers formed in software .",
    ".summary of jlc / nlc and tesla accelerator parameters .",
    "luminosities include the pinch enhancement .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     of still greater interest , however , is a direct measurement of the top - higgs yukawa coupling , @xmath9 .",
    "such a measurement , like those of the higgs branching ratios discussed above , is needed to establish the `` higgsness '' of the higgs , and may also probe the special nature of the top quark . at the lhc , the ratio @xmath10 can be measured to an accuracy of 25% for @xmath11  gev@xcite . for a light higgs ,",
    "@xmath9 can be measured at the lc in @xmath12 production . for higgs masses around 120  gev",
    ", the cross section for this process peaks at about 2.6  fb for @xmath13-@xmath14  gev and then falls off slowly .",
    "this is some three orders of magnitude smaller than the dominant @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 backgrounds .",
    "but the spectacular nature of these events ( @xmath18 if both tops decay hadronically , or @xmath19 +  if both tops decay semi - leptonically ) , and their many kinematic constraints , provide enough handles that backgrounds can be acceptably reduced through direct mass reconstruction@xcite or a neural net@xcite . in the latter study ,",
    "the authors assume 1000  fb@xmath4 ( about 3 years of running at @xmath20 ) at @xmath21  gev , and obtain a 5.5% uncertainty on @xmath9 .",
    "outstanding flavor - id is again a prerequisite for this measurement .",
    "the possibility of measuring @xmath9 with such high precision is a strong argument in favor of the highest possible luminosities .",
    "the recent proposal@xcite to resolve the hierarchy problem through a theory of low - scale quantum gravity with large extra spacetime dimensions has generated great interest because of its testable consequences at colliders@xcite . in these models , standard model fields",
    "are confined to the 4-dimensional boundary of a `` bulk '' with @xmath22 compact extra dimensions of characteristic size @xmath23 .",
    "gravitons propagate in the bulk , where they couple with a strength of order the electroweak strength ( hence the elimination of the hierarchy ) .",
    "the apparent weakness of gravity in our 4-dimensional world arises from the geometrical suppression of the gravitational flux lines by a factor proportional to the volume of the compact extra dimensions : @xmath24 where @xmath25  gev is the planck scale , @xmath26 is the volume of the compact extra dimensions , and @xmath27 is the fundamental planck scale in the bulk . if we require @xmath28 to eliminate the hierarchy , we can obtain the characteristic size @xmath23 of the extra dimensions for various values of @xmath22 .",
    "values of @xmath23 as large as a fraction of a millimeter are permitted by current limits from cavendish - type experiments@xcite .    for phenomenological purposes , we are most concerned with the effective lagrangian that describes the interactions between gravitons and sm fields in our 4-dimensional world@xcite .",
    "gravitons then appear as a kaluza - klein tower , or series , of closely - spaced massive spin-2 states that can be emitted or exchanged along with sm gauge bosons .",
    "each such state has a very weak coupling to matter , of order @xmath29 , but because of the large number of these states their cumulative effect is comparable to that of standard model processes at energies near @xmath27 .    one way to search for the effect of these large extra dimensions at",
    "the lc is through the effect of graviton exchange on fermion pair production@xcite .",
    "this process is extremely well - understood theoretically and is a sensitive probe of many types of new physics , including @xmath30 s , compositeness , and technicolor .",
    "graviton exchange turns out to leave the total cross section and integrated left - right asymmetry unchanged , but modifies the angular distributions in a way that depends on a single parameter , @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is a dimensionless parameter of order one ( but of either sign ) that depends on model - dependent physics above @xmath27 .",
    "a fit to the angular distribution of @xmath33 , and @xmath34 gives the exclusion reach shown in figure  [ fig : hewett](a ) .",
    "a 1  tev lc with 200  fb@xmath4 can exclude @xmath27 up to 6.6 tev , similar to the 6.0  tev achievable with the lhc in 100  fb@xmath4 using @xmath35 and @xmath36 final states only .",
    "however , the lhc may have difficulty distinguishing a graviton signal from some other new physics process , such as a @xmath30 . at the lc , the polarized beams and the ability to observe @xmath37 and @xmath34 final states allow a clear separation between spin-1 and spin-2 exchange for @xmath27 up to about @xmath38 , as shown in figure  [ fig : hewett](b )",
    "tev - scale @xmath0 linear colliders offer complementary access to the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking that will be explored initially by the lhc . assuming that both the nlc and tesla designs prove technologically ( and financially ) feasible , the choice of which one to build may depend on the relative importance of high luminosity for the highest precision measurements at lower energies ( tesla ) , versus upgradability to 1 - 1.5 tev for exploratory physics and possible fuller elucidation of the susy spectrum .",
    "more advanced accelerator designs , such as the two - beam clic@xcite design , may open the path to even higher energies in coming decades , ensuring a vibrant future for  physics in the post - lhc era .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers for a stimulating and enjoyable conference in a lovely setting .",
