    "this article examines the motion of stellar systems in  einstein  aether \" theory  an alternative theory of gravity that permits breaking of lorentz symmetry through a dynamical preferred frame .",
    "the general theory contains four dimensionless couplings whose values can be constrained by comparing the predictions of the theory with observations  in particular , observations of binary pulsar systems .",
    "it will be demonstrated that all current tests will be passed by a one - parameter family whose couplings are  small - enough \" that is , on the order of @xmath0 or less . identifying whether there is a viable extension of this family to large coupling values requires additional work beyond this article .",
    "the question of whether the physical world is exactly lorentz invariant has received increasing attention in recent years .",
    "this interest is sourced largely by hints of lorentz violation in popular candidates for theories of quantum gravity  for instance , string theory  @xcite , loop quantum gravity  @xcite , and noncommutative field theory  @xcite .",
    "more broadly , challenging the rule of lorentz symmetry means challenging the fundamentals of all of modern physics , and doing that is just plain exciting .",
    "the review  @xcite discusses a wide variety of theoretical models that feature lorentz - symmetry violating effects , and observational searches for violations .",
    "so far no conclusive sign of lorentz variance has been identified , and very strong bounds exist on the size of couplings for lorentz - violating effects in standard model extensions  @xcite .",
    "the effects of lorentz violation in a gravitational context , however , are not covered by these bounds .",
    "einstein  aether theory  or  ae - theory \" for short  is a classical metric theory of gravity that contains an additional dynamical vector field .",
    "the vector field  aether \" is constrained to be timelike everywhere and of fixed norm .",
    "the aether can be thought of as a remnant of unknown , planck - scale , lorentz - violating physics .",
    "it defines a preferred frame , while its status as a dynamical field preserves diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the fixed norm , which can always be scaled to unity , ensures that the aether picks out just a spacetime direction and removes instabilities in the unconstrained theory  @xcite .",
    "much of past work on ae - theory has focussed on placing observational bounds on the values of the four free parameters @xmath1 appearing in the ae - theory action , eqn .  .",
    "constraints have been derived from the rate of primordial nucleosynthesis  @xcite , the rate of erenkov radiation  @xcite , the requirements of stability and energy positivity of linearized wave modes  @xcite , and the parameterized post - newtonian ( pn ) form of the theory  @xcite .",
    "a summary of these constraints was presented in  @xcite , where it was shown that they are met by a large two - parameter subset of the original four - parameter class of theories .",
    "additional constraints on the @xmath1 come from observations of binary pulsar systems .",
    "study of the predictions of ae - theory for binary pulsars was begun in  @xcite . there , an expression for the rate of radiation damping in @xmath2-body systems was derived to lowest non - trivial pn order and _ neglecting effects due to strong fields in the vicinity of the bodies_. it was shown that a one - parameter subset of the two - parameter family allowed by the collected constraints discussed in  @xcite would pass tests from binary pulsar systems if there were justification for ignoring strong field effects .",
    "that neglect is dangerous , though , since the fields inside neutron star pulsars should be very strong .",
    "justification requires an unclear assumption on the values of the @xmath1 .    in this article",
    ", i will incorporate strong field effects on binary pulsar systems , calculating the pn equations of motion and the rate of radiation damping of a system of strongly self - gravitating bodies .",
    "the effects will be handled via an effective approach in which the compact bodies are treated as point particles whose action contains nonstandard couplings that depend on the velocity of the particles in the preferred frame .",
    "the effective approach to @xmath2-body dynamics in relativistic gravity theories has previously been employed in pure general relativity ( gr ) and other alternative theories ; see for example  @xcite .",
    "the new interactions are parametrized by dimensionless coefficients , or  sensitivities \" , whose values can be calculated for a given stellar source by matching the effective theory onto the exact , perfect fluid theory .",
    "prior work  @xcite reveals just the form of the  first \" sensitivity at lowest order in the self - potential of a body .",
    "the expressions obtained can be used to constrain the allowed class of ae - theories .",
    "observations of binary pulsar systems allow for measurement of  post - keplerian \" ( pk ) parameters that describe perturbations of the binary s keplerian orbit due to relativistic effects .",
    "these parameters are mostly  quasi - static \" ones , whose expressions can be derived from the non - radiative parts of the pn forms of the gravitational fields and the effective equations of motion for the bodies . in addition , there is the radiation damping rate , whose expression depends on the radiative parts of the fields .",
    "the ae - theory expressions for the pk parameters differ from those of pure gr in that they depend on the @xmath1 , the sensitivities , and the center - of - mass velocity of the system of bodies . stating precise constraints for general @xmath1 values will require work beyond the scope of this article  specifically ,",
    "what is needed is a method for dealing with dependence on the unmeasurable center - of - mass velocity and a calculation of the values of the sensitivities of a given source .    for the time being , a few comments can be made , which will be defended below",
    ". a crucial piece of information learned by comparing the weak field limit of the effective theory with the weak field limit of the perfect fluid theory  @xcite is that the sensitivities will be  small \" .",
    "that is , they will be at least as small as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the body s mass and @xmath5 its size , times a @xmath1 dependent coefficient that must scale at least linearly with @xmath1 in the small @xmath1 limit . for neutron stars in pure gr , @xmath6",
    "; it is reasonable to expect something similar in ae - theory based on studies of stellar solutions  @xcite and the fact that ae - theory is generally  close \" in the small-@xmath1 limit , to gr plus a non - dynamical vector field .",
    "it then follows that bounds on the magnitude of violations of the strong equivalence principle  @xcite constrain the @xmath1 dependent factor to be less than @xmath7 it further follows that the strong field corrections fall below the level of current observational uncertainties when @xmath8 and the two conditions that match the ae - theory ppn parameters to those of gr are imposed .",
    "thus , weak field analysis  @xcite suffices for small enough @xmath1 , and implies the existence of a one - parameter family of theories that passes all current tests from binary pulsar systems .",
    "i will now present the strong field formulas .",
    "first , the effective particle action is constructed , and the exact field equations are defined in sec .",
    "the pn expansions of the metric and aether fields are then given in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , and used to express the pn equations of motion for a binary system in sec .  [ sec4 ] . the rate of radiation damping is then determined in sec .",
    "comments on dealing with center - of - mass velocity and sensitivity dependence are given in sec .",

    "i follow the conventions of wald  @xcite . in particular",
    ", i use units in which the flat space speed - of - light @xmath9 , and i use metric signature @xmath10 .",
    "this signature is opposite to that employed in  @xcite , but it is much more convenient for calculations involving a time - space decomposition .",
    "the ae - theory action is defined here in such a way as to permit easy comparison between  @xcite and this article .",

    "the aim of this work is to treat within ae - theory a system of compact bodies that potentially possess strong internal gravitational fields .",
    "the complicated internal workings of the bodies will be dealt with via an effective approach that reproduces the bulk motion of the bodies and the fields far from them .",
    "each body will be treated as a point particle with the composition dependent effects encapsulated in nonstandard couplings in the particle action .",
    "the form of the effective action can be deduced from the following considerations . the one - particle action @xmath18 will have the rough form @xmath19 , where the integral is along the particle worldline parametrized by @xmath20 , @xmath21 has dimensions of mass , and @xmath22 is a sum of dimensionless local scalar quantities .",
    "the fundamental theory has only one dimensionful parameter @xmath23 . for a first approximation",
    ", the spin of the body can be neglected .",
    "derivative couplings in the particle theory are then suppressed by powers of @xmath24 , where @xmath5 is the size of the underlying finite - sized body and @xmath25 is the radius of curvature of the background spacetime .",
    "in addition , @xmath18 presumably reduces to the standard free particle action if the particle is comoving with the local aether and must be invariant under reparametrization of the particle worldline .",
    "these considerations imply the following one - particle action : [ 1bodys ] s_a=-_a d_a ( 1 + _ a ( u^a v_a+1 ) + ( u^a v_a+1)^2 + ) , where @xmath26 labels the body , @xmath27 is the proper time along the body s curve , @xmath28 is the body s unit four - velocity , and @xmath29 is the aether .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 expressed in a pn expansion with the aether purely timelike at lowest order , is of order @xmath31 , the square of the velocity of the body in the aether frame . by assumption , @xmath31 is first pn order ( 1pn ) .",
    "the 1pn corrections to newtonian equations of motion will follow from the part of the action that is @xmath32 , so only the terms in @xmath18 written above are needed for current purposes . for a system of @xmath2 particles ,",
    "the action is given by the sum of @xmath2 copies of @xmath18 .",
    "this action can be thought of as a taylor expansion of the standard worldline action , but with a mass that is a function of @xmath33 : s_a = -d_a [ ] .",
    "the expansion is made about @xmath34 .",
    "the parameters @xmath35 are then defined as _ a = -|_=1 , _a = _ a+ _ a^2 + |_a , |_a = |_= 1 .",
    "this form of @xmath18 suggests that that @xmath36 can be determined by considering asymptotic properties of perturbations of static stellar solutions .",
    "the full action is the four - parameter ae - theory action @xmath37 [ act6 ] s = d^4x ( r - k^ab_cd_a u^c _ b u^d + ( u^a u^b g_ab + 1 ) ) , plus the sum of @xmath2 copies of @xmath18  , retaining only the terms explicitly written above . here ,",

    "while the sign of the @xmath38 term looks awkward , it permits easier comparison with the results of  @xcite .",

    "thus , this curve gives a one - parameter family of viable ae - theories if the weak field results alone are sufficient .",
    "to simplify the expression  , it is crucial to note that the damping rate is calculated to lowest pn order using the newtonian results for the motion of the system .",
    "thus , the system s motion can be decomposed into a uniform center - of - mass motion  recall the conservation of @xmath80and a fixed keplerian orbit in the center - of - mass frame . since the motion is steady - state , the damping rate must have no secular time dependence .",
    "this observation implies that secular terms in @xmath118 arising from @xmath119 , see below , must cancel with secular terms in @xmath120 .",

    "while the aether frame center - of - mass velocity @xmath127 of a binary system is not directly measurable , dependence of a binary systems s motion on @xmath127 should actually be beneficial for constraining the theory .",
    "this is because constraints arise from a failure to observe @xmath127 dependent effects . it may be possible to formulate such constraints without having to determine the physical frame , as in the manner of bounds on the ppn parameter @xmath128 .",
    "the presence of alignment between the sun s spin axis and the ecliptic plane signals the absence of frame dependent effects , and leads to a strong bound of @xmath129  @xcite . this argument does require the assumption that the component of the preferred frame in the sun s rest frame is not conveniently aligned with the sun s spin axis ; such an assumption may generally be required for similar arguments .",
    "for example , @xmath127 dependence should cause a binary s orbital plane to precess , but not if @xmath127 happens to be normal to the plane .",
    "an assumption on the order of magnitude of the norm @xmath130 is necessary to justify the use of just the leading pn order expressions for the pk parameters when applied to observed binary systems . the validity of the 1pn expressions depends on whether corrections of relative order @xmath31 and @xmath131 are smaller than observational uncertainties",

    "this  @xcite .",
    "the double pulsar psr j0737 - 3039a / b is the so - far unique binary containing two pulsars .",
    "the orbital velocity is high , @xmath133 , and the presence of two pulsars happens to make measurement of system parameters much easier and thus more precise  the smallest relative uncertainty is @xmath134 on the rate of periastron advance .",
    "the @xmath31 corrections are therefore small enough for now , but it is expected that precision will increase to probe the next pn order within the next 10 - 20 years  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath127 dependent terms must feature @xmath1 dependent factors , since it is known that there is no center - of - mass velocity dependence at next pn order in pure gr  @xcite . ignoring those factors for the moment , validity of leading pn order for the double pulsar",
    "requires that @xmath135 , giving @xmath136 , or @xmath137 . for other systems , given uncertainties ranging from @xmath138 ,",
    "the conditions are @xmath139 , giving @xmath140 , or @xmath141 .",
    "presumably , the @xmath1 dependent factor actually goes to zero as some positive power of @xmath1 , so @xmath130 can be larger in the small @xmath1 limit .",
    "a reasonable first guess for the aether frame is the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "a typical velocity for compact objects in our galaxy in this frame is @xmath142 , so the restriction on @xmath130 is met .      a formula for the sensitivities for a given source should be obtainable by comparing the strong field results of this article with analogous results in the exact perfect fluid theory .",
    "higher order terms in the exact theory must be calculated , though , since the leading order results of  @xcite only give the @xmath143 part of @xmath108 expressed in  .",
    "the calculation can be done in the case of a single body that is static except for a constant aether frame velocity , by , for example , continuing the iterative procedure used to determine the ppn parameters  @xcite .",
    "the process may be lengthy , but straightforward .",
    "i have shown that the sensitivity of a body will scale with the body s self - potential like @xmath144(g_n m / d)^2 $ ] , where @xmath145 is some @xmath1-dependent coefficient that scales at least as fast as @xmath1 in the small @xmath1 limit . even in the absence of a formula for the sensitivities and precise knowledge of center - of - mass velocities ,",
    "two useful comments can be derived .",
    "first , a constraint can be roughly stated : @xmath146 .",
    "second , there exists a one - parameter family of theories that passes all current constraints , obtained by restricting to @xmath1 with magnitude less than roughly @xmath147 and imposing the two ppn conditions , the one weak field damping rate condition , and the collected non - binary conditions .",
    "the condition that @xmath148 follows from constraints  @xcite on the magnitude of violations of the strong equivalence principle  that is , that a body s acceleration is independent of its composition .",
    "a violation would lead to a polarization of the orbit of pulsar systems due to unequal acceleration of the binary bodies in the gravitational field of the galaxy .",
    "the observed lack of polarization in neutron star ",
    "white dwarf systems leads to a constraint that can be stated here as @xmath149 , where here @xmath108 is the sensitivity of the neutron star in the considered pulsars .",
    "assuming that @xmath150 for the pulsar , as it is in gr , the constraint on the size of @xmath145 arises .",
    "it is possible that when the weak field conditions are imposed , @xmath145 will automatically satisfy the above inequality ; certainly it will in the small @xmath1 regime when @xmath151 .    the statement , that current tests will be satisfied if the weak field conditions are imposed and the remaining degree of @xmath1 freedom satisfies @xmath152 , can be derived by considering the battery of binary pulsar tests .",
    "first , consider tests that probe only the quasi - static pk parameters  that is , all but the damping rate .",
    "the tightest quasi - static test comes from the double pulsar  @xcite .",
    "the relative size of the strong field corrections to the weak field expressions will be @xmath153 , while the prediction of gr has been confirmed to within a relative observational uncertainty of @xmath154 . requiring @xmath155 and assuming that @xmath156 for the pulsars , the condition @xmath152 arises . given this and the two conditions that set the ppn parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 to zero , all current quasi - static tests will be passed .",
    "tests that incorporate the damping rate will also be satisfied by the small-@xmath1 condition and the weak field conditions .",
    "i note first that for systems in which the damping rate is probed , uncertainty on its measurement dominates uncertainties on quasi - static parameters  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is conventional to use the measurements of the quasi - static parameters to solve for the mass values of the binary bodies .",
    "when @xmath157 , and @xmath152 , so that the expressions for the quasi - static parameters are close to those of gr , the predicted mass values will also be close .",
    "now , the dipole contribution to @xmath118 can be significant in asymmetric systems where the sensitivity of one body is much larger than the other .",
    "the dipole contribution is _",
    "dipole = -g_n ( s_1 - s_2)^2 , which is of order @xmath158 compared to the quadrupole and monopole contribution , where @xmath108 is the dominant sensitivity . an applicable system is a neutron star ",
    "white dwarf binary , since for a typical white dwarf , @xmath159 .",
    "constraints have been derived  @xcite on the magnitude of dipole radiation from neutron star  white dwarf binaries psr b0655 + 64 and psr j1012 + 5307 by requiring that the dipole radiation rate be no larger than the observed rate .",
    "the analysis applied here leads to the condition @xmath160 , where @xmath108 is the sensitivity of the neutron star . in the small @xmath1 regime",
    ", this translates again to the condition @xmath152 .    for double neutron star binaries ,",
    "the dipole rate is further suppressed by the similarities of the sensitivities , and the quadrupole and monopole contributions become dominant .",
    "the tightest test involving radiation is associated with the hulse ",
    "taylor binary psr1913 + 16 , with a relative uncertainty of @xmath161  @xcite . in the small @xmath1 regime ,",
    "the condition @xmath117 matches the leading order damping rate to that of gr .",
    "the strong field corrections are of relative order @xmath108 ; to be smaller than the uncertainty again requires @xmath152 .",
    "this upper limit on @xmath162 will decrease as observational uncertainties decrease .",
    "the most promising candidate for lowering the limit is the double pulsar : 2pn - order and spin - dependent effects should be observable within the next ten or twenty years  @xcite .",
    "another type of system , yet undetected , for which high levels of accuracy could be obtained is a neutron star ",
    "black hole binary , as the structureless black hole would decrease noise due to finite - size effects and mass transfer between the bodies .    for @xmath163 ,",
    "strong field contributions to the expressions for the pk parameters may be significant .",
    "those contributions for a given source can not yet be calculated , so the theory can not be checked against observations .",
    "thus , there is no conclusion yet on the viability of large @xmath1 values . if it were possible to calculate precise predictions for a given binary system , then each observed system would imply an extension from small to large @xmath1 of the curve of allowed values .",
    "the only physically viable values would be those for which the curves for all observed systems overlapped within error .",
