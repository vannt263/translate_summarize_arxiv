    "among extragalactic radio source , those with a physical size larger than @xmath16 mpc at the source rest frame are called as _ giant radio galaxies_. the synchrotron aging technique suggests that they are relatively old sources with a typical age of @xmath19 myr @xcite . therefore , from the giant radio galaxies",
    ", we can explore the late phase of the evolution of the radio sources and the associated jets , which is not yet well understood .",
    "the bulk kinetic energy , carried by the jets of a radio galaxy , is integrated within the lobes after it is randomized and converted into the particle and magnetic energies at its terminal hot spots .",
    "the lobes are regarded as an important indicator of the past activity of the jets .",
    "one of the most valuable tools to measure the electron and magnetic energies stored in the lobes is diffuse inverse compton ( ic ) x - ray emission , where the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons are up - scattered ( @xcite ; hereafter ic / cmb ) . actually , the energetics in the lobes of numbers of radio galaxies are investigated from the diffuse x - ray emission which was naturally interpreted as the ic / cmb emission in the last two decades , with rosat @xcite , asca ( e.g. , @xcite ) , chandra ( e.g. , @xcite ) and xmm - newton ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these results indicate a dominance of the electron energy over the magnetic one by typically an order of magnitude in the lobes of radio galaxies ( @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "however , most of the sample is limited to the sources with a total dimension of @xmath20 kpc , so far .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig1a.eps ( 78.5mm,78.5mm)fig1b.eps    the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) onboard the suzaku observatory @xcite , in combination with the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) , opened a new window for the x - ray study of the lobes of radio galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , thanks to its low and stable instrumental background , which is crucial to investigate diffuse x - ray emission . with the suzaku xis , detections of the diffuse x - ray photons",
    "has subsequently been reported from the giant radio galaxies 3c 326 @xcite and 3c 35 @xcite , and these x - rays were successfully attributed to be radiated via the ic / cmb process . based on these results , @xcite proposed a possibility that the current jet power of the giant radio galaxies are significantly lower than that of the smaller objects .",
    "this motivated us to make a systematic x - ray study of giant radio galaxies .",
    "the giant radio galaxy da 240 is located at a redshift of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "it is optically classified into a low - excitation radio galaxy @xcite with an elliptical host @xcite .",
    "its radio images ( e.g. , @xcite ) revealed its classical fanaroff - riley ( fr ) ii morphology , where the lobes have a relatively flat brightness distribution .",
    "the total angular size of the source , , corresponds to a physical size of @xmath0 mpc at the redshift of the source .",
    "its spectral age was estimated as @xmath22 myr @xcite , suggesting that it is a relatively old source .",
    "the object has a high integrated synchrotron radio flux of @xmath23 jy at 609 mhz @xcite , which suggests a high ic / cmb x - ray flux from its lobes .",
    "although there is a bright radio hot spot in the east lobe , which was also detected in x - rays with xmm - newton @xcite , its contamination to the lobe is to be estimated and to be clearly removed from the diffuse lobe emission owing to the large size of the lobe in comparison with the point spread function of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) over the xis with a half power diameter of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "these make da 240 suitable for a suzaku observation .    in the present paper",
    ", we adopted the cosmology with @xmath25 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "these give the luminosity distance of @xmath29 mpc and the angle - to - size conversion ratio of @xmath30 kpc/@xmath31 , at the redshift of da 240 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we performed a suzaku observation of the giant radio galaxy da 240 , on 2010 march 19  21 .",
    "we pointed the telescope at the east lobe , since its integrated radio flux is higher than that of the west lobe . in order to minimize the influence of the anomalous columns of xis 0 and the hole of the optical blocking filter over xis 1 , the sky position with the j2000 coordinate of ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) = ( , )",
    "was placed at the xis nominal position ( @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the whole east lobe was observed within the clean field of view of the xis .",
    "the normal clocking mode with no window option was adopted for the xis while the normal mode was employed for the hxd .",
    "we reduced the data with the latest version of the standard software package headas 6.10 . since the lobe emission was found to be too faint for the hxd , only the xis data are utilized .",
    "all the xis data were reprocessed , by referring to the caldb updated at 2010 july 30 .",
    "we screened the data under the following standard criteria ; the spacecraft is outside the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , the time after an exit from the saa is larger than 436 s , the geometric cut - off rigidity is higher than @xmath35 gv , the source elevation above the rim of bright and night earth is higher than @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , and the xis data are free from telemetry saturation .",
    "these yielded a good exposure of @xmath38 ks . in the scientific analysis",
    "below , we selected the xis events with a grade of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 6 .      in order to identify possible contaminating faint x - ray sources unresolved with the xis angular resolution",

    "we thus calibrated the xis coordinate by ourselves , by referring to the chandra position ( see below ) of the hot spot in the east lobe ( the triangle in figure [ fig : image ] ) , which is clearly detected in the xis image .",
    "after the coordinate correction , figure [ fig : image ] indicates that the x - ray position of the hot spot deviates from its radio position by @xmath48 toward the south direction .",
    "the similar positional offset , in addition to the detailed spatial structure of the hot spot , is reported by @xcite , by using the higher - resolution radio and x - ray images obtained with the very large array and xmm - newton , respectively .",

    "it is unclear whether or not diffuse faint x - ray emission associated with the lobe was detected .",
    "the xis image suggests several x - ray sources within the east lobe .",

    "the agreement between the radio synchrotron and x - ray spectral slopes of the lobe , in combination with the fact that the radio and x - ray spectra do not smoothly connect to each other as we see in figure [ fig : sed ] , strongly supports the interpretation that the synchrotron electrons in the east lobe radiate the excess x - ray emission through the ic scattering . such ic x - ray emission",
    "is widely observed from other radio sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including giant radio galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we evaluate the energy density of the possible seed photon candidates for the ic process in the lobe .",
    "these include the cmb photons @xcite , infra - red ( ir ) radiation from the active nucleus @xcite , and the synchrotron photons produced within the lobe themselves .",
    "assuming an isotropic radiation , the ir flux density of the da 240 nucleus , 53 mjy at 60 @xmath146 m @xcite , yields an ir photon energy density of @xmath147 ergs @xmath8 where @xmath148 is the distance from the nucleus . in the case of the fr ii radio galaxies , including da 240 , ir photons from the base of the jet could serve as a seed photon source to some extent . since a large part of such ir emission",
    "is thought to be unobservable from our line of sight , due to a beaming effect from the relativistic bulk motion of the jet , it is not easy to evaluate precisely its energy density .",
    "assuming a typical doppler beaming factor of @xmath149 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the ic scattering off the jet ir photons is thought to become effective only within the narrow cone toward the jet direction with an opening angle of @xmath150 .",
    "if this is the case , the ic x - ray emission should be enhanced along the jet , connecting the nucleus and hot spot .",
    "however , we do not find such spatial structure in the xis image in figure [ fig : image ] .",
    "therefore , we regard that such ic process is unimportant for the x - ray emission observed from the lobe of da 240 . from the radio spectrum plotted in figure [ fig : sed ] , the synchrotron photons are estimated to be negligible , with an energy density of @xmath151 ergs @xmath8 if it is spatially averaged over the lobe .",
    "thus , we concluded that the cmb , with an energy density of @xmath152 ergs @xmath8 at the redshift of da 240 ( @xmath32 ) , highly dominates the other seed photon sources . the recent @xmath153-ray result with fermi from centaurus",
    "a @xcite confirmed an additional contribution from the extragalactic background light to the seed photon source .",
    "however , such ic emission is only detectable at the highest energy end of the ic spectrum in the gev @xmath153-ray range with only a negligible x - ray flux .",
    "based on the simple analytical formula for the ic / cmb process presented in @xcite , we derive the energy densities of the electrons and magnetic field , @xmath15 and @xmath154 respectively , in the east lobe of da 240 .",

    "giant radio galaxies ( shown with the blue symbols ) tend to be distributed around the bottom - left corner in the diagram , except for the lobes of 3c 457 @xcite of which the data point is located around the center of the distribution .",
    "especially , @xmath15 in the east lobe of da 240 is measured to be the lowest among all the x - ray detected lobes .",
    "in addition , @xmath154 in the giant radio galaxies is typically indicated to be lower than than the cmb energy density .",
    "thus , this result strengthened the idea that the dominance of the ic / cmb radiative losses over the synchrotron one is a common properties in the lobes of giant radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "as we frequently pointed out in the previous paper ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the lobes typically exhibit an electron dominance of @xmath170 , over a wide range of @xmath15 and @xmath154 .",
    "in contrast , a relatively large fraction of the giant radio galaxies detected with the ic / cmb x - rays ( da 240 and 3c 35 out of the 5 giants in total ) is found to reside nearly in the equipartition condition .",
    "we speculate that as the radio source develop from a @xmath171 kpc scale to a mpc one , the energetics in their lobes evolve from the electron dominance to the equipartition , in addition to a significant decrease in both @xmath15 and @xmath154 .",
    "the evolution of the lobe energetics is more explicitly examined in figure [ fig : ue - d ] , which plots the relation between @xmath15 and the total size @xmath172 of the radio galaxies .",
    "it is pointed out that a radio galaxy develop along the relation of @xmath173 while its lobes are actively energized by its jets @xcite .",
    "after the jet power supplied to the lobes become declined , the value of @xmath15 is thought to be significantly reduced by adiabatic expansion and radiative losses due to synchrotron and ic / cmb emission .",
    "this idea is supported by a correlation of @xmath174 for the radio galaxies with @xmath175 kpc ( the black diamonds ) , which is shown with the dashed line in figure [ fig : ue - d ] . on the other hand , it is notable that for the radio galaxy with a dormant nucleus , fornax a @xcite , the data points are located below the correlation line by more than an order of magnitude in figure [ fig : ue - d ] @xcite .",

    "this implies a significant decrease in the jet activity of radio galaxies , in the range of @xmath190 kpc@xmath52 mpc . even though the bright radio hot spots in da 240 suggesting an ongoing energy input to its lobes , the relatively steep synchrotron radio and ic x - ray spectra with the photon index of @xmath191 indicate that the east lobe of this radio galaxy reside in a strong cooling regime",
    "this means that the current energy supply to the lobe is ineffective , in comparison with the cooling loss .",
    "in fact , the rather inactive nucleus of da 240 , revealed in the xmm - newton observation with an observed luminosity of @xmath135 ergs s@xmath26 and re - confirmed in this suzaku observation with the upper - limit x - ray luminosity of @xmath132 ergs s@xmath26 in the 0.7  7 kev range , is though to be compatible with the currently low power jet scenario .    in figures [ fig : ue - um ] and [ fig : ue - d ] , we found an outlier among the giant radio galaxies , 3c 457 , with exceptionally high energy densities of @xmath192 ergs s@xmath26 and @xmath193 ergs s@xmath26 @xcite , which are comparable to those of the `` normal '' radio galaxies with @xmath194 kpc .",
    "it is reported that 3c 457 hosts a rather active nucleus with a 0.7  7 kev intrinsic luminosity of @xmath195 ergs s@xmath26 ( estimated from @xcite ) , which is more than 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of da 240 .",
    "since its radio images revealed bright hot spots at the edge of the individual lobes @xcite , it is concluded that the lobes of 3c 457 is currently expanding very fast .",
    "these are naturally regarded to be equivalent to the ongoing energy input to the lobes from the jets through the hot spots , in this radio galaxy .",
    "these active features of 3c 457 are thought to be related to the fact that the source is relatively young with a spectral age of @xmath196 myr @xcite as a giant radio galaxy ( typically @xmath19 myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , based on the consideration above , we have proposed that the jet of typical radio galaxies is possible to reduce its activity , as they evolve in size typically from @xmath197 kpc to @xmath198 mpc , although the number of giant radio galaxies , studied with the ic / cmb x - ray emission , is still small . in order to make a definite conclusion , x - ray observations of giant radio galaxies",
    "are strongly encouraged with suzaku and future high - sensitivity x - ray missions , including the next generation japanese x - ray observatory astro - h @xcite .",
