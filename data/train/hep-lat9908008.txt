    "it is generally expected that two - flavor qcd undergoes a high temperature chiral - symmetry - restoring phase transition at zero quark mass with o(4 ) critical behavior@xcite .",
    "should the axial anomaly disappear simultaneously with the phase transition , the pisarski wilczek scenario then suggests a fluctuation - driven first order phase transition .",
    "verifying these expectations is important for understanding the phenomenology of the transition and for facilitating an extrapolation of simulation data to physical quark masses .",
    "since the staggered fermion scheme breaks the anomaly explicitly at nonzero lattice spacing , lattice qcd at fixed @xmath1 with staggered fermions , as a statistical system in its own right , is similarly expected to exhibit at least o(2 ) universality , with o(4 ) or a fluctuation - driven first - order phase transition emerging in the continuum limit @xmath2 . at @xmath3",
    "the lattice spacing is coarse enough that , if there is a critical point at zero quark mass , o(2 ) is the only likely option .",
    "the standard test of universality compares critical exponents .",
    "comparing the critical scaling function itself gives further insight . to test for the expected universality we use the standard correspondence between qcd variables and o(n ) spin variables , which identifies quark mass @xmath4 with magnetic field @xmath5 , inverse gauge coupling @xmath6 with temperature @xmath7 , chiral condensate @xmath8 with magnetization @xmath9 , and the action ( plaquette ) with the energy density .",
    "a critical point is expected to occur at zero quark mass and nonzero coupling @xmath10 . for studies at fixed @xmath1 ,",
    "therefore , we define@xcite @xmath11    critical scaling theory predicts that for small quark masses we have the fisher scaling relation @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are scale constants , @xmath16 is the critical scaling function for qcd and @xmath17 is that for the appropriate universality class @xmath18 .",
    "only the scale constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 are adjustable .",
    "some critical exponents are given in table [ tab : crit_exp ] .",
    "outside the ginzburg scaling region , by definition , there are appreciable nonleading , nonscaling contributions to @xmath8 , analytic in @xmath19 and @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to corrections analytic in @xmath19 and @xmath5 , there are correction terms with subleading exponents , universal and nonanalytic in @xmath19 and @xmath5 .",
    "the mean - field scaling function is known exactly . for the o(4 ) scaling function we use results of a numerical simulation@xcite .",
    "there is a similar scaling relation for the energy density . in qcd the energy density ( plaquette )",
    "is dominated by gluon degrees of freedom , which are indirectly affected by the chiral singularity .",
    "so apparently there is a much larger analytic contribution .",
    "consequently , we have found the plaquette observable much less useful for testing critical scaling .",
    "here we concentrate on the scaling of @xmath8 .    in the next section",
    "we discuss an analysis of finite size effects , present a determination of some critical exponents , and compare our results with the critical scaling function . in the concluding section",
    "we suggest reasons for the discrepancies observed .",
    "a preliminary version of this study was presented at lattice 97 @xcite .",
    "our data set extends an old sample on lattice sizes @xmath20 with @xmath3 , @xmath21 and quark masses @xmath22 and 0.0125 , which was generated with the standard one - plaquette gauge action plus two - flavor staggered fermion action .",
    "our new simulations decrease the quark mass to @xmath23 and increase the spatial lattice size @xmath24 to 24 ( aspect ratio 6 ) .",
    "we also reanalyzed old data at @xmath25 , 8 , and 12 @xcite .",
    "the old data , unfortunately , are limited to aspect ratio @xmath26 .",
    "the extent of our @xmath3 data sample is given in table [ tab : data_set ] .",
    "included in this table are values for global observables .",
    "for equilibration we typically dropped the first 300 molecular dynamics time units of each run .    over the range of nonzero quark masses considered",
    ", there appears to be no phase transition  only a crossover , as illustrated for @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbp_m008 ] . evidently , however , the crossover steepens as the lattice volume is increased . the crossover , or `` pseudo - critical point '' is signaled by a peak in a susceptibility for any lattice size .",
    "for example the mixed plaquette / chiral condensate susceptibility , corresponding to the slope in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbp_m008 ] , @xmath28 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbpa ] for the @xmath29 lattice . here , as well as in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbp_m008 ] , we use multihistogram reweighting to interpolate the data from the simulation points and locate the peak .",
    "the error analysis was performed with the jackknife method , which enables us to obtain reliable error estimates for both the peak height and location .",
    "the peak location ( crossover coupling @xmath30 ) shows little variation in lattice size for @xmath31 .",
    "for example the peak location in @xmath32 shifts from 5.2605(10 ) to 5.2623(6 ) as @xmath24 increases from 12 to 24 , a scarcely significant change .",
    "it also shows little variation among the susceptibilities chosen .",
    "for example the peak location varies by @xmath33 over the susceptibilities considered . in all cases",
    "we take the result from the largest volume and assign an error of 0.002 .",
    "close to the critical point the peak position occurs at a fixed value of the scaling variable @xmath34 , so we have the scaling relation @xcite @xmath35 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pseudo_crit_scaling ] is the trajectory of the pseudocritical point , fitted to both @xmath36 and mean - field predictions .",
    "both fits are good .",
    "an @xmath37 fit would do equally well .",
    "such agreement was first found by karsch and laermann and inspired hope that the simulations had entered the scaling region @xcite .",
    "problems with scaling were uncovered in studies at larger volumes @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ fig : pbpa_ext_0125 ] and [ fig : pbpa_ext_008 ] we plot the peak height of the @xmath32 susceptibility for two fixed quark masses .",
    "the increase in peak height with increasing volume reflects the steepening trend seen , for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbp_m008 ] .",
    "it is necessary to extrapolate to infinite volume at each quark mass before checking scaling .",
    "we start by assuming the conventional scenario , in which the critical point occurs at @xmath38 .",
    "then at nonzero mass , the susceptibility has a finite limit at large volume .",
    "we make an _ ad hoc _",
    "choice for an extrapolation formula with the result shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pbpa_ext_0125 ] and [ fig : pbpa_ext_008 ] . @xmath39",
    "the @xmath40 data covers the largest range of lattice sizes .",
    "varying the inverse power of @xmath24 from 1/2 to 1 to 2 gives a slight preference for @xmath41 at this mass .",
    "given the uncertainties in the values themselves , we feel it is safe to use any of these extrapolations , and we have chosen @xmath41 for all masses . the extrapolated peak height of the @xmath32 susceptibility is expected to scale with decreasing quark mass . for this susceptibility , the expected scaling relation is @xmath42 we compare this prediction with results from our analysis in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbpa_ext ] . also shown",
    "are similarly extrapolated jlqcd values @xcite .",
    "if we include all points in the fit , the scaling exponent is @xmath43 , compared with an @xmath36 prediction of @xmath44  a clear disagreement , corroborating results of the jlqcd and bielefeld groups @xcite . however , it is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbpa_ext ] that at the three lightest masses this observable alone does not exclude o(4 ) . to test sensitivity to our extrapolation formula",
    ", we carried out the same analysis , replacing @xmath41 by @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting scaling exponents are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , still clearly at variance with @xmath36 over the full mass range studied .",
    "a similar fit of the plaquette susceptibility , @xmath49 , also including @xmath41-extrapolated jlqcd results , yields a scaling exponent of @xmath50 , while the @xmath36 prediction is @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 extrapolations give @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . because the crossover steepens so much with increasing lattice volume and small quark mass , it is worthwhile looking for evidence for two - phase metastability , signaling a first - order phase transition .",
    "figure [ fig : pbp.m008l24 ] shows the simulation time histories of our runs at @xmath54 . while we certainly see long correlation times , we see no evidence for a first order transition in these histories . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbp_hot_cold ] we show time histories from hot and cold starts at @xmath55 ( two hot and two cold starts ) and @xmath54 at values of @xmath6 near the peaks of the susceptibilities .",
    "again , there is no evidence for a first order transition .",
    "we turn next to an analysis of the critical scaling function , given by eq ( [ eq : scaling_fcn ] ) . here , again , we assume that we are in the scaling region .",
    "the analysis then depends on which critical exponents we adopt .",
    "using @xmath36 critical exponents from kanaya and kaya @xcite , we construct @xmath56 and compare with the scaling function @xmath57 for o(4 ) @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbpnt4.change.5225 ] . essentially all of the data lie at positive @xmath58 , which permits a log - log plot .",
    "vertical and horizontal displacements of the log - log scaling curves correspond to adjusting @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , no such displacement would result in good agreement .",
    "the newer data are plotted with octagons and squares .",
    "we observe : ( 1 ) the qcd curve falls with increasing steepness as the quark mass is decreased . since the slope of the curve at the crossover gives the peak height of the @xmath32 susceptibility , the disagreement there is consistent with the observed lack of scaling of the peak height itself .",
    "( 2 ) the new data at larger volume and smaller quark mass show generally worse agreement with the @xmath36 scaling curve .",
    "( 3 ) the crossover regions , indicated in the qcd results by line segments and in the @xmath36 scaling function by a dashed line , are far from agreeing .",
    "we show a similar comparison of the qcd scaling function with the mean - field prediction in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbpnt4.change.5235.mf ] .",
    "again the disagreement is significant .",
    "although we have not measured the @xmath37 scaling function , so can not make a direct comparison , given the close similarity of the critical exponents with @xmath36 , we do not expect any improvement with that choice .    we conclude that if the @xmath3 theory falls in the @xmath37 or @xmath36 universality class , simulations at present masses do not reach the critical scaling region .",
    "furthermore , as the quark mass is decreased over the present range , disagreement with scaling predictions worsens , offering little hope that we might be getting closer .    a similar analysis at larger @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbp_o4 ] .",
    "perhaps there is improvement with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "however , our @xmath59 sample includes data only at a single quark mass , making it the weakest test .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath60 we have no results for @xmath61 , where we first encountered difficulties at @xmath3 .",
    "we have seen that new simulations at smaller quark mass and larger volume at @xmath3 have raised doubts about the extent of the previously observed agreement between qcd and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the conventional staggered fermion action with the conventional choice of scaling variables does not show good agreement with the @xmath36 or mean field scaling functions at present quark masses and temperatures .",
    "( wilson quarks with an improved gauge action seem to behave very differently @xcite . )",
    "believers in the conventional sigma model scenario could argue that the critical region is attained only when @xmath62 and @xmath63 correlation lengths are considerably greater than @xmath64 . only in that case",
    "is the reduction of qcd to a three - dimensional sigma model well justified . here ,",
    "typically , these correlation lengths are smaller than @xmath64 .",
    "still , the observed worsening of the agreement with decreasing quark mass is disturbing .",
    "recent results from simulations of the conventional @xmath3 staggered fermion action , augmented by a four - fermi term ( `` chiral qcd '' ) permit another speculation@xcite . with the additional four - fermi interaction , kogut , laga , and sinclair",
    "are able to carry out simulations at precisely zero quark mass .",
    "they find evidence for a first order phase transition at small four - fermi coupling .",
    "a nearby first order phase transition could spoil the approach to the critical point .",
    "indeed , one can not , therefore , rule out the possibility that the first order phase transition extends to zero four - fermion coupling for a small range of quark masses below the reach of our simulations . in this case , one expects a critical end - point at a nonzero quark mass @xmath65 in the ising or mean - field universality class . at @xmath25",
    "the same group finds evidence for a crossover instead of a first - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "thus , one may speculate that the conventional one - plaquette , staggered fermion action at @xmath3 is plagued by lattice artifacts large enough to obliterate the expected @xmath38 critical point , but these artifacts diminish at higher @xmath1 .",
