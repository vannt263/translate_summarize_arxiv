    "let @xmath3 be a set of @xmath0 elements and @xmath4 be the distance between @xmath5 and @xmath6 according to a given distance metric such that @xmath7 if @xmath8 and @xmath9 otherwise . the minimum differential dispersion problem ( _ min - diff dp _ ) is to identify a subset @xmath10 of a given cardinality @xmath1 @xmath11 , such that the difference between the maximum sum and the minimum sum of the inter - element distances between any two elements in @xmath12 is minimized . formally , _",
    "min - diff dp _ can be described in the following way .",
    "let @xmath13 be the sum of pairwise distances between an element @xmath14 and the remaining elements in @xmath12 , that is :    @xmath15    the objective value @xmath16 of the solution @xmath12 is then defined by the following differential dispersion :    @xmath17    then , _",
    "min - diff dp _ is to find a subset @xmath18 of size @xmath1 with the minimum differential dispersion , i.e. ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the search space including all possible subsets of size @xmath1 in @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "the size of @xmath20 is extremely large , up to a maximum number of @xmath23 .",
    "_ min - diff dp _ is one of many diversity or dispersion problems @xcite which basically aim to find a subset @xmath12 from a given set of elements , such that a distance - based objective function over the elements in @xmath12 is maximized or minimized .",
    "these problems can be further classified according to two types of objective functions :    * _ efficiency - based _ measures which consider some dispersion quantity for all elements in @xmath12 . this category mainly includes the _ maximum diversity problem _ ( mdp ) and the _ max - min diversity problem _ ( mmdp ) , which respectively maximizes the total sum of the inter - element distances of any two chosen elements and the minimum distance of any two chosen elements .",
    "* _ equity - based _ measures which guarantee equitable dispersion among the selected elements .",
    "this category includes three problems : ( i ) the _ maximum mean dispersion problem _ ( max - mean dp ) maximizes the average inter - element distance among the chosen elements ; ( ii ) the _ maximum min - sum dispersion problem _ ( max - min - sum dp ) maximizes the minimum sum of the inter - element distances between any two chosen elements ; ( iii ) the _ minimum differential dispersion problem _ considered in this work .",
    "it is worth noting that the cardinality of subset @xmath12 is fixed except for max - mean dp .",
    "in addition to their theoretical significance as np - hard problems , diversity problems have a variety of real - world applications in facility location @xcite , pollution control @xcite , maximally diverse / similar group selection ( e.g. , biological diversity , admission policy formulation , committee formation , curriculum design , market planning ) @xcite , densest subgraph identification @xcite , selection of homogeneous groups @xcite , web pages ranking @xcite , community mining @xcite , and network flow problems @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we focus on _ min - diff dp _ , which is known to be strongly np - hard @xcite .",
    "_ min - diff dp _ can be formulated as a 0 - 1 mixed integer programming problem ( mip ) @xcite .",
    "thus it can be conveniently solved by mip solvers like ibm ilog cplex optimizer ( cplex ) . however , being an exact solver , cplex is only able to solve instances of small size ( up to @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , while requiring high cpu times ( more than 2500 seconds ) @xcite . for medium and large instances , heuristic and meta - heuristic algorithms",
    "are often preferred to solve the problem approximately . in recent years",
    ", several heuristic approaches have been proposed in the literature @xcite . in particular , in 2015 , based on greedy randomized adaptive search procedure ( grasp ) , variable neighborhood search ( vns ) and exterior path relinking ( epr ) , duarte et al . proposed several effective hybrid heuristics @xcite . very recently ( 2016 ) , mladenovi et al . proposed an improved vns algorithm which uses the swap neighborhood both in its descent and shaking phases @xcite .",
    "this new vns algorithm significantly outperforms the previous best heuristics reported in @xcite and is the current best - performing algorithm available in the literature for _ min - diff dp_. we will use it as our main reference for the computational studies .",
    "our literature review showed that , contrary to other diversity problems like mdp and max - min dp for which many methods , both exact and heuristic , have been investigated , there are currently only a few studies for _ min - diff dp _ , in particular in terms of heuristic methods . to fill the gap , we introduce in this work an iterated local search algorithm , denoted as ils_mindiff , which adopts the general framework of the three - phase search . to efficiently explore the search space , ils_mindiff iterates through three sequential search phases : a descent - based neighborhood search phase to reach a local optimum from a given starting solution , a local optima exploring phase to discover nearby local optima within a given search region and a local optima escaping phase to displace the search into a new and distant region . despite its simplicity , ils_mindiff competes very favorably with the state - of - the - art methods when it was tested on 190 benchmark instances available in the literature .",
    "specifically , ils_mindiff achieved improved best results ( new lower bounds ) for 131 out of 190 instances ( @xmath26 ) and matched the best - known results for 42 instances .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present a brief literature review on the iterated local search framework and its two recent variants . in section [ sec :",
    "hybrid iterated local search ] , we describe the general framework and the key components of the proposed algorithm . in section [ computational experiments",
    "] , we present an extensive experimental comparison with state - of - the - art algorithms . a parameter analysis is provided in section [ sec : experimental analysis ] , followed by conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "as one of the most widely - used meta - heuristic approaches , _ iterated local search _ ( ils ) @xcite has been successfully applied to solve a variety of combinatorial optimization problems . in spite of its conceptual simplicity , it has led to a number of state - of - the - art results .",
    "figure [ fig : paper statistic ] shows that over the last two decades , there has been an increasing interest in ils , as witnessed by the number of publications related to ils .",
    "ils is an iterated two - phase approach whose key idea is to explore at each iteration the search zones around the last local optimum discovered by a local search procedure .",
    "typically , ils iteratively alters between two phases : a perturbation phase to modify the current local optimal solution followed by a local search phase to find a new local optimum from the modified solution ( algorithm [ algorithm : ils framework ] ) @xcite .",

    "in this section , we study the impact of the parameters of ils_mindiff on its performance : the search depth @xmath36 , the weak perturbation strength @xmath37 and the strong perturbation coefficient @xmath38 .",
    "the analysis was based on a set of 9 instances selected from all six data sets , i.e. , _ som - b_8_n200_m80 _ , _ som - b_20_n500_m200 _ , _ gkd - b_50_n150_m45 _ , _ gkd - c_20_n500_m50 _ , _ mdg - a_20_n500_m50 _ , _ mdg - a_40_n2000_m200 _ , _ mdg - b_20_n500_m50 _ , _ mdg - b_40_n2000_m200 _ and _ mdg - c_20_n3000_m600_. for each selected instance with @xmath39 , we solved it 20 times , otherwise we solved it 10 times .      to investigate the effect of the search depth @xmath36 on the performance of ils_mindiff",
    ", we first fixed the weak perturbation strength @xmath37 to 3 and the strong perturbation coefficient @xmath38 to 1.0 , i.e. , @xmath40 , and then varied @xmath36 from 1.0 to 10.0 with a step size of 1 .",
    "figure [ fig : search depth ] shows the behavior of the ils_mindiff algorithm with @xmath36 varying from 1.0 to 10.0 , where the x - axis indicates the values of @xmath36 while y - axis shows the best / average objective value .     on the performance of the ils_mindiff algorithm , scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "figure [ fig : search depth ] discloses that the average solution values of ils_mindiff continuously decreases when the value of @xmath36 increases from 1.0 to 10.0 for all tested instances except for _ mdg - c_20_n3000_m600_. for _ mdg - c_20_n3000_m600 _ , the curve shows a large variation and it also decreases when @xmath36 increases to 5 .",
    "we also observe that ils_mindiff obtains a superior best solution value when @xmath36 is 4 or 5 on all tested instances .",
    "this justifies the adopted setting ( @xmath41 ) shown in table [ tab : parameters table ] .",
    "to study the effect of the weak perturbation strength @xmath37 on the performance of the proposed algorithm , we first fixed the search depth @xmath36 to 5 according to the outcomes of section [ effect of the search depth @xmath36 ] , and the strong perturbation coefficient @xmath38 to 1.0 , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "then , we varied the value of @xmath37 from 1.0 to 10.0 with a step size of 1 .",
    "figure [ fig : weak perturbation strength ] shows the performances of the ils_mindiff with different values of @xmath37 varying from 1.0 to 10.0 , where the x - axis and y - axis respectively shows the weak perturbation strength @xmath37 and the best / average objective values .     on the performance of the ils_mindiff algorithm , scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "figure [ fig : weak perturbation strength ] indicates that almost for all 9 tested instances , the best performance was attained when @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "a too large or small @xmath37 value gave a poor performance of the ils_mindiff algorithm .",
    "this can be understood given that a small @xmath37 value can not enable the search to jump out of the current local optimum , while a too large value of @xmath37 will have an effect similar to a random restart .",
    "this justifies the adopted setting for @xmath37 shown in table [ tab : parameters table ] .",
    "the ability of the ils_mindiff algorithm to escape deep local optima depends on the strong perturbation strength @xmath46 . to analyze the influence of the strong perturbation coefficient @xmath38 on the performance of the algorithm",
    ", we fixed the search depth @xmath36 and the weak perturbation strength @xmath37 respectively according to the values determined from figures [ fig : search depth ] and [ fig : weak perturbation strength ] , and varied the strong perturbation coefficient @xmath38 from 1.0 to 1.9 with a step size of 0.1 .",
    "figure [ fig : strong perturbation coefficient ] displays the outcomes of this experiment , where the x - axis and the y - axis respectively denote the values of @xmath38 and the best / average objective values .     on the performance of the ils_mindiff algorithm , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    as we can see from figure [ fig : strong perturbation coefficient ] , the average solution value is not really sensitive to @xmath38 on almost all tested instances except for _ mdg - c_20_n3000_m600_. to achieve a better average solution value , we roughly set @xmath47 for all instances .",
    "the minimum differential dispersion problem ( _ min - diff dp _ ) is a useful model in a variety of practical applications . however , finding high - quality solutions to large _ min - diff dp _ instances represents an imposing computational challenge . in this work ,",
    "we have proposed a highly effective iterated local search algorithm for _ min - diff dp _ ( denoted as ils_mindiff ) , which adopts the general three - phase search framework . to ensure a suitable balance between intensification and diversification of the search process , ils_mindiff runs sequentially and iteratively a fast descent - based neighborhood search phase to locate local optimal solutions , a local optima exploring phase to seek nearby better local optima , and a local optima escaping phase to escape deep attraction basin with strong perturbations .",
    "extensive computational experiments on six data sets of 190 benchmark instances have demonstrated that despite its simplicity , the proposed algorithm competes very favorably with the state - of - the - art methods in the literature . in particular , ils_mindiff is able to find new best results for 131 out of 190 instances ( improved upper bounds ) and match the best - known results for 42 out of the remaining 59 instances .",
