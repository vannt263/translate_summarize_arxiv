    "<S> a common theme in much research on self - assembly in lcs is the sensitive dependence of the assembly behavior on non - trivial boundary geometry , such as colloid shape @xcite and substrate topography @xcite .    even when not organized in a lattice , fcds exhibit a high level of geometric organization as seen in the arrangement of their focal curve pairs , which are conjugate conic sections : an ellipse and a hyperbola ( or two parabol , a case that we will not study here ) . </S>",

    "<S> however , the foci of the ellipses that are pierced by the hyperbol , seen easily in bright field microscopy , are on the `` far side '' of the ellipse  unlike in the fan texture where the hyperbol  converge , in the flower they diverge away from @xmath0 with no obvious intersection , apparently violating friedel s lcc .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we show that such packings of fcds with diverging hyperbol  can be obtained by designing hybrid anchoring conditions such that one boundary is ( approximately ) a surface of revolution with negative slope in the radial outward direction . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , we demonstrate that curved interfaces provide a way to promote spatially varying fcd eccentricity , leading to complex patterns which could guide the assembly of technologically important materials , such as colloids , nanoparticles , and quantum dots , for novel metamaterials , sensors , optoelectronic devices , and solar cells @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , thanks to the lensing properties of individual fcds @xcite , arrays of fcds organized radially as in the flower texture could efficiently focus light toward a central point , where the _ virtual _ ( unphysical ) branches of the hyperbol  intersect , for optical and photovoltaic applications .    </S>",
    "<S> we present two examples of smectic flower textures obtained from different material systems . in system </S>",
    "<S> a , the smectic - air interface is deformed by pinning at the boundary of a large colloidal inclusion , resulting in a flower texture with fcds organized radially around the colloid . in system </S>",
    "<S> b , a sma lc is placed on a substrate promoting degenerate planar anchoring , and the air interface , which imposes homeotropic anchoring , is partly replaced by a fluorosilane modified layer of @xmath1 nanoparticles that instead impose degenerate planar anchoring on the lc ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ah_fcds]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the smectic layers tilt toward the boundary between the nanoparticle - covered and nanoparticle - depleted regions , and fcds of varying eccentricity interpose between these tilted layers and the nanoparticle interface . in both systems , </S>",
    "<S> the key geometric feature is a mismatch in orientation between the interface with degenerate planar anchoring and the smectic layers at the opposite boundary . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we provide a theoretical model applying the lcc to the flower texture . by geometrically constructing a `` background texture '' that approximates an arbitrary homeotropic interface profile , </S>",
    "<S> we show that fcds of nonzero eccentricity can be smoothly embedded such that their hyperbol  extend radially outward , without violating the lcc .    in both system </S>",
    "<S> a and system b , smectic flower textures are observed in thin smectic films subjected to ( effectively ) hybrid anchoring conditions . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ mg_flower1 ] shows an example of such a texture in system a , in which flower textures assemble around a large colloidal inclusion . </S>",
    "<S> the average smectic thickness is smaller than the critical thickness @xmath2 below which fcds cost greater energy than homeotropically - aligned layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , pinning of the lc - air interface at the colloid increases the thickness locally above @xmath2 , so that fcds form near the colloid . </S>",
    "<S> the film thickness , and thus the typical domain size , decrease with increasing distance from the colloid . under bright field microscopy ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mg_flower1]a ) , the nonzero eccentricity of the fcds is apparent both from the elongation of the ellipses and from the off - center dots marking the termination of the hyperbol . as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the hyperbol  are oriented radially outward from the center , in contrast to typical fan textures where the hyperbol  converge to a central point . </S>",
    "<S> this organization is confirmed by polarized optical microscopy ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mg_flower1]b ) , which reveals dark crosses shifted off of the ellipse centers away from the colloid . </S>",
    "<S> the interfacial deformation created by the colloid leads to capillary attraction between nearby colloids to minimize the excess free energy caused by the overlap of deformations in the lc - air interface . </S>",
    "<S> figure ( [ mg_flower1]c ) shows a colloidal dimer with nearby fcds .    </S>",
    "<S> nonzero eccentricity is correlated with nonzero slope of the lc - air interface due to surface pinning at the colloid , which satisfies wetting conditions at particle surfaces as described by the young equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the slope in the radial outward direction decreases from a maximum at the colloid to zero asymptotically , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mg_flower1]d , where the profile of the lc - air interface around the inclusion , measured using scanning white - light interferometry ( swli ) , is represented . accordingly , the fcds nearest to the colloid have the highest eccentricity , while those far away have nearly zero eccentricity ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mg_flower1]e ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , fcd eccentricity is controlled by the orientation mismatch between the horizontal substrate , which imposes degenerate planar anchoring , and the locally tilted lc - air interface , which imposes homeotropic anchoring .     with apex @xmath0 and base @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the tfcd now occupies the space between two cones @xmath4 and @xmath5 , both containing the circular focal curve @xmath3 but with different apices @xmath0 , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> two different families of concentric spherical regions are centered at @xmath0 , @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) a smaller circle @xmath7 defines the base of a third cone @xmath8 as well as the focal curve of a second tfcd bounded by this cone . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) this construction works also with type - ii fcds . </S>",
    "<S> black lines outlining boundary cones are continued past the cone apex to the focal circles as gray lines . ]    in addition to the substrate and air interfaces , we might expect that anchoring on the colloid would also affect fcd formation . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the colloids were treated with polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) to replace homeotropic anchoring with strong degenerate planar anchoring on their surfaces , qualitatively similar flower textures were observed . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that the importance of the colloid in producing the flower texture lies in the colloid s wetting chemistry that deforms the lc - air interface , _ not _ the liquid crystalline anchoring on the colloid surface .    in system b </S>",
    "<S> , flowers textures also form in small planar - aligned islands covered by perfluorosilane treated @xmath1 nanoparticles surrounded by hybrid - aligned , nanoparticle - depleted regions , as shown in figure [ ah_fcds]b . here , </S>",
    "<S> the elliptical focal curves are visible at the top interface ; the hyperbol  extend downward . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ ah_fcds]c shows a less well - ordered flower texture , with striations in the nanoparticle arrangement revealing the arrangement of smectic layers . </S>",
    "<S> the ellipse focus of each fcd , where the hyperbola meets the lc - nanoparticle interface , is clearly visible as the center of a set of concentric circles in this plane . </S>",
    "<S> the hyperbol  are consistently oriented outward from the center of the planar - aligned region , toward the boundary with the hybrid aligned region .    </S>",
    "<S> the cause of the flower texture in this system is made clear by a cross - sectional sem image of the smectic layers ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ah_fcds]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> layers in the planar - aligned region bend outward toward the hybrid - aligned region . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the layer geometry as viewed from above consists of a planar - anchoring horizontal surface at the top and what can be thought of as a tilted homeotropic surface below , created by the bent layers . </S>",
    "<S> this is the geometry that produced a flower texture in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mg_flower1 ] , only upside - down ! to see this connection more clearly , we illustrate the geometry of system b schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ah_fcds]e </S>",
    "<S> . there , an arbitrarily selected bent layer , colored green , conceptually plays the same role as the curved homeotropic interface of system a. a slight difference between the two experiments is that as distance from the center of the flower texture increases , the typical domain size increases in system b whereas it decreases in system a.    can these flower textures be described by the law of corresponding cones ? in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the authors suggest that the _ virtual _ branches of the hyperbol  meet at a common point above the center of the flower , rather than the physical hyperbol  as in fan textures under the lcc . </S>",
    "<S> we put forth a geometric construction that applies the lcc  to hybrid - aligned smectics where the homeotropic interface is a surface of revolution , while the degenerate planar interface is flat . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the predictions of this model to the data .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by reviewing the law of corresponding cones for a family of fcds . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9th fcd is bounded by a cone @xmath10 that has its apex @xmath0 on the hyperbola @xmath11 and that includes the ellipse @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath10 consists entirely of generators , which are normal to the smectic layers and which each connect a point on @xmath12 to a point on @xmath11 . in the fan texture , when two ellipses @xmath13 and @xmath14 are tangent at a point @xmath15 , then their boundary cones @xmath16 and @xmath17 are tangent along an entire generator if @xmath16 and @xmath17 have a common apex @xmath0 where the hyperbol  @xmath18 and @xmath19 intersect ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ db_fcds]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> tangency along the generator @xmath20 means that the layer normals of the two fcds agree precisely where the fcds come into contact with each other . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , an fcd with bounding cone apex at @xmath0 may be joined smoothly onto a family of concentric spheres centered at @xmath0 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ db_fcds]b ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is fortunate because concentric spheres , like fcds , have a focal set of dimension less than two , avoiding energetically costly cusp wall defects .    in the case of tilt grain boundaries split into fcds </S>",
    "<S> , the cone apex @xmath0 is moved off to infinity along @xmath21 so that in place of a `` background '' texture of concetric spheres , the fcd matches smoothly onto a background texture of planes whose normal direction matches the hyperbola s asymptotic direction @xcite . the bounding cone @xmath4 has become a bounding cylinder .    </S>",
    "<S> exactly the same reasoning would apply in a hybrid - aligned smectic if the homeotropic interface were a tilted plane , with the degenerate planar interface replacing the tilt grain boundary . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the homeotropic interface is gently curved , it is reasonable to expect the eccentricity to increase with the slope of the interface , which is indeed the case as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mg_flower1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , however , the tilt grain boundary model disagrees with the fcd eccentricities @xmath22 in our system a : for a ( local ) homeotropic interface slope of @xmath23 , the formula given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite predicts @xmath24 which does not fit our data ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mg_flower1]e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the curvature of the interface is therefore an important factor . but with a curved interface , what is the background geometry into which we are to imagine placing fcds ?    </S>",
    "<S> we construct such a background texture as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first consider a single toric fcd ( tfcd ) , bounded by a right circular cone @xmath4 with apex @xmath0 , whose base @xmath3 ( the circular focal curve of the tfcd ) has radius @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> as already noted , the layers of the tfcd join smoothly onto a family of spheres concentric about @xmath0 that exist outside of @xmath4 ( fig [ db_fcds]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> but we can also bound a tfcd inside the space between two cones @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with the same base but with different apices @xmath0 and @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then , the tfcd also matches smoothly onto spherical layers concentric about @xmath6 that exist only inside of @xmath5 ( fig [ db_fcds]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> but once we have this second family of concentric spheres , it is straightforward to cut out from these spheres a cone @xmath8 sharing the apex @xmath6 with @xmath5 but with circular base @xmath7 of radius @xmath26 , and then fill in this cone with a second tfcd ( fig [ db_fcds]d ) </S>",
    "<S> . we could continue in this fashion , dividing a region into arbitrarily many nested alternating concentric sphere families and tfcds , separated by conical bounding surfaces that alternately share a common base or a common apex with the next cone . by construction , axial symmetry is preserved .    </S>",
    "<S> now , by turning the picture upside down , we see that an arbitrary surface of revolution can be approximated by an outermost layer of this alternating set of tfcds and concentric spheres ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ db_fcds2]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the homeotropic interface is a surface of revolution , this construction generates a smectic layer that approximates that surface , as well as a family of parallel , equally spaced layers below . </S>",
    "<S> if the homeotropic interface is planar at large radius , then the background tfcd of largest radius can be made to match smoothly onto planar layers by moving the apex of the largest bounding cone off to infinity , turning the cone into a cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ db_fcds2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in each family of concentric spheres bounded between two cones with common apex @xmath27 , we can place a ring of fcds with nonzero eccentricity , all bounded by smaller cones with common apex at @xmath27 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ db_fcds2]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> these fcds obey the lcc and match smoothly onto the background texture . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , because the fcds bounding cones have apex below the degenerate planar interface rather than above the homeotropic interface , all of the hyperbolic focal curves will be oriented radially outward ( fig [ db_fcds2]c ) ! the virtual branches of the hyperbol , meanwhile , intersect at the common apex @xmath27 below the center of the flower for all fcds in the same ring . </S>",
    "<S> thus the defining feature of the smectic flower texture can be brought into accordance with the lcc using this construction .    </S>",
    "<S> note that there is no requirement that the circular focal curves sit at the same height , though we have made this choice in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ db_fcds ] and [ db_fcds2 ] for simplicity . a reasonable , though not unique , alternative is to position each circle at the local center of curvature of the interface s profile . </S>",
    "<S> also , an analogous geometric construction employs type - ii fcds ( fig [ db_fcds]e ) , which produce an interface of purely positive gaussian curvature @xcite , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the tilt angle increases with increasing radius . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the picture does not need to be inverted to produce a flower texture , as the cones bounding the concentric spherical regions open upward in fig [ db_fcds]e . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that this model naturally extends a previous model for polygonal domains , in which the fcds visible in the experiment are grouped inside background textures of concentric spheres , the various sphere families being glued together by portions of invisible fcds whose focal curves lie outside the sample @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> does this geometric construction describe the experimental results ? while we have successfully captured the radial divergence of hyperbolic focal curves within the lcc , we pause to note some other implications of the model . </S>",
    "<S> first , while fcds within each ring are tangent to their neighbors , the fcds in different rings must have some space between their ellipses , where the background tfcd interposes between concentric sphere families . </S>",
    "<S> this gap is also present in the previously mentioned model for polygonal domains @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while such a gap is not visible in the experimental images , it can be made small in the model by appropriate choices of bounding cones , to squeeze the background tfcds into very small angles .        </S>",
    "<S> second , a corollary of the previous point is that fcds are predicted to pack within each ring but not to show any consistent organization from one ring to the next . </S>",
    "<S> this is plausibly consistent with the results in system a ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mg_flower1 ] ) , provided that the radius of the ring is given some leeway to vary so as to allow for compromise with the quasi - hexagonal packing of ellipses preferred by the degenerate planar substrate . </S>",
    "<S> however , system b appears to show fcds grouped into radial wedges rather than concentric rings ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ah_fcds ] ) , contrary to our expectation from the lcc . instead , it is possible that each wedge of fcds in system b has a background texture with no curvature in the azimuthal direction , this curvature being concentrated instead into small - angle tilt grain boundaries between neighboring wedges .    </S>",
    "<S> thin - film smectics need not precisely obey the lcc because more general layer structures , other than spheres and fcds , do nt incur prohibitive energy penalties if they are generated by virtual focal sets lying outside the sample , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ ,  their geometry does not require cusps in the smectic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model presented here demonstrates that the lcc is flexible enough to account for the basic features of the smectic flower but probably not capable of quantitatively describing the textures we observe .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that control over the orientation mismatch between the hybrid aligning interfaces of a smectic thin film provides control over the fcd eccentricity and , thus , over complex patterns of self - organization in a liquid crystal . in particular , we have produced smectic flower textures in two experiments : one in which the lc - air interface is curved by pinning at the surface of a colloidal inclusion , the other in which the boundary between a planar - aligned region covered by @xmath1 nanoparticles and a hybrid - aligned region exposed to air creates effective tilted hybrid anchoring . </S>",
    "<S> the radial outward orientation of the focal hyperbol , unique to the flower texture , is deduced to arise from the outward tilt of the homeotropic interface s normal vector . </S>",
    "<S> we have extended previous lcc - based models by proposing a geometric model for hybrid - aligned smectics in the case that the homeotropic interface is a surface of revolution . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting nested system of background tfcds and concentric spheres naturally allows for fcds with their hyperbol  oriented radially outward , as in the flower texture . comparing the implications of this model with the experimental results </S>",
    "<S> shows that the lcc can accomodate the arrangement of fcds in a flower texture but does not describe the details of their packing behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the findings presented here will open the door to crafting highly sophisticated self - assembled patterns in smectic liquid crystals , for use in guiding functional materials such as colloids and nanoparticles into technologically useful arrangements , by clever preparation of the boundaries .    </S>",
