    "time - reversal breaking phases are predicted to occur in the so called _ pseudogap _ region of the phase diagram of the cuprates.@xcite these phases do not change the translational symmetry of the lattice and therefore do not produce new bragg spots in ordinary diffraction experiments . since the spontaneous magnetic field generated averages to zero in each unit cell , no simple magnetic dichroism effects arise .",

    "were such samples to have a transition to magnetoelectric phases , such bragg spots would be allowed for some pattern of currents ( which enlarge the _ primitive _ unit cell ) due to transition amplitude tensors for x - ray scattering which also break time - reversal and inversion . even in the case",

    "this means that in the intensity for scattering of linearly polarized waves there is no interference term between the e1-e1 and e1-e2 channels when time - reversal is preserved but an interference exists between the time - reversal even part of the e1-e1 and the time - reversal odd part of the e1-e2 channel .",

    "[ ] one can get a rough estimate for @xmath63 . to get an interference term @xmath64",
    ", one needs to have an interference with the main e1-e1 term , which is real ( its coefficient , @xmath65 is real for both circular and linear polarizations ) .",
    "since the quadrupole matrix elements are are usually of @xmath66 of the dipole matrix elements , the magnitude of the effect is of @xmath67 of the typical resonant bragg peaks .",
    "the atomic x - ray absorption cross section can be written as the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude or by the fermi golden rule :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "the total absorption cross - section is then given by the sum over all the atoms in the unit cell . in the following two subsections",
    "we describe two dichroism experiments to detect the time - reversal broken phase in the pseudogap region of the cuprates .",
    "the geometrical conditions for either are determined by the magnetic symmetries of the material as well as the experimental geometry .",
    "the intensity of the effect is then simply determined on the basis of the so - called `` sum rules '' @xcite and of the explicit form of the conduction - band wave function , as determined for the cuprates.@xcite      linear dichroism in the x - ray range is the differential spectrum obtained by subtracting two core absorption spectra taken with orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "if the difference is of dipole - dipole ( e1-e1 ) origin , it represents normal x - ray linear dichroism ( xld ) and if of dipole - quadrupole origin , it represents nonreciprocal linear dichroism ( nrxld ) .    from ref .",

    "( [ lindice1e1 ] ) and ( [ lindice1e2 ] ) is in the time - reversal and inversion properties of the two operators .",
    "the first operator is time - reversal even and inversion even , being the symmetric traceless part of a cartesian second rank polar tensor . on the other hand",

    "magnetoelectric_. this situation is fulfilled in one of the time - reversal broken phases found in refs .",
    "[ ] . thus the detection of nrxld would be a clear evidence of the time - reversal broken phase .",
    "the geometrical conditions to detect the effect are discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "the order of magnitude of the effect is readily estimated as in the previous section for the scattering amplitude .",
    "the nrxld is due to an electric - dipole electric - quadrupole transition . as such",
    ", it mixes states of different parity : considering a k - edge process , these states are the @xmath81 and @xmath82 conduction bands . as shown in refs .",
    "[ ] , the generic time - reversal broken wave function for the cuprates is such that @xmath83 is of @xmath81 type and in @xmath84 there is a part with @xmath82 symmetry . thus the average in eq .",

    "this of course gives the same estimate obtained for the scattering amplitude , about 0.5@xmath85 , which is detectable with modern synchrotron radiation sources.@xcite      another technique that can be adopted to detect the time - reversal broken phase in the cuprates is the magnetochiral dichroism ( mcd ) .",
    "circular dichroism in e1-e1 channel is excluded , being sensitive to the expectation value of the orbital angular momentum , which is zero for the patterns found in refs .",
    "inversion - odd circular dichroism is time - reversal even , giving rise to x - ray natural circular dichroism , and thus it is excluded as well .",
    "but , as shown recently by goulon et al.@xcite for cr@xmath86o@xmath87 , the sum of two right and left circularly polarized spectra can give rise to a dichroism in magnetochiral systems , ie , magnetoelectric systems whose magnetoelectric tensor has an antisymmetric off - diagonal part . note",
    "that this is just the case of the magnetic symmetry predicted by simon and varma.@xcite in this case the dichroism is defined as the difference between the sum of two orthogonally polarized spectra in one magnetoelectric domain and those in the opposite magnetoelectric domain .",
    "note that for cuprates the choice of the magnetoelectric domain could be made difficult by the fact that they are not insulators .    as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , the magnetochiral dichroism is proportional to the expectation value , in the conduction states , of the operator @xmath88 , where @xmath74 is the direction of the wavevector of the absorbed photon :    @xmath89    in section iv we analyze the geometrical conditions to detect the effect .",
    "an eventual magnetochiral signal is a definite indication of the time - reversal broken phase .    as for nrxld ,",
    "the intensity of the signal should be of order 0.5@xmath85 , within the present experimental capabilities .",
    "we have considered the following materials : hgba@xmath86cuo@xmath90 , tl@xmath86ba@xmath86cuo@xmath91 , la@xmath92sr@xmath93cuo@xmath94 , bi@xmath86sr@xmath86cacu@xmath86o@xmath95 . except the orthorombic phase of la@xmath92sr@xmath93cuo@xmath94 , that must be studied separately , these cuprates all have _ crystalline _ space group symmetry 4/mmm ( the crystal class is primitive for hgba@xmath86cuo@xmath90 , body - centered for all the others ) .",
    "the copper ion occupies a site of maximal symmetry ( 4/mmm ) in all the cases except for bi@xmath86sr@xmath86cacu@xmath86o@xmath95 , where the symmetry is 4 mm : the mirror plane orthogonal to the four - fold axis is lost because in the bilayered compounds one of the apical oxygens is missing .",
    "two types of time - reversal breaking states can be proposed , according to the results of ref .",
    "[ ] , one with magnetic - group symmetry @xmath96 mm and the other with magnetic- group symmetry m@xmath97 m ( we use birss notation @xmath98 for a time - reversed symmetry operator @xmath99 ) .",
    "the magnetic group @xmath96 mm , ( which remains tetragonal ) is such that the inversion symmetry is preserved , while both time - reversal and the product of the time - reversal and inversion are broken .",
    "since inversion is preserved , no e1-e2 signals ( that are inversion - odd ) are possible . at the same time , the simultaneous presence of three mirror planes as symmetry elements ( even if one is time - reversed ) forbids the possibility of a magnetic moment as a local invariant ( because the magnetic moment is an axial quantity and can not be invariant under the action of two orthogonal mirror planes ) .",
    "this implies that with this pattern time - reversal odd quantities can be detected only in the e2-e2 channel .",
    "more interesting is the case when the symmetry is reduced to m@xmath97 m .",
    "this is the symmetry consistent with the results of the arpes experiment in bi-2212 .",
    "first of all , in this case the system is no longer tetragonal .",
    "this can in principle be detected by an azimuthal scan around the original four - fold axis as the new periodicity is determined by the mirror and is no longer four - fold .",
    "since inversion symmetry is also lost , in this phase the detection of some phenomena linked to magnetoelectricity becomes possible .",
    "apart from a direct observation of magnetoelectric susceptibility , x - ray diffraction , non - reciprocal linear dichroism and magnetochirality in the e1-e2 channel are all possible experiments to observe this phase .",
    "as we already saw the interesting effects arise in the e1-e2 channel through finite third - rank polar time - reversal odd tensors specified , for example , in eqs .",
    "( [ e1e2minusplus ] ) , ( [ e1e2minusminus ] ) .",
    "we specify the tensors using the following co - ordinates : the c axis of the crystal coincides with the @xmath100 direction , a and b crystalline axis ( those along the nearest neighbor cu - cu vector ) are along the @xmath101 and @xmath102 directions , as is clear from fig .",
    "the point group m@xmath97 m has the following elements : the identity , two - fold axis rotation around @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) , the reflections in the @xmath105 and @xmath106 planes ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( where @xmath113 is the time - reversal operator ) .",
    "the distinct non - zero elements of the third - rank polar tensors , odd under time - reversal in this point group are seven@xcite : @xmath114 .",
    "if we write the seven allowed tensors by symmetrizing the first two indices , we get the symmetric @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 and the antisymmetric @xmath120 and @xmath121 . the formers can be detected only with the symmetrized part of the polarizations , ie , they correspond to @xmath122 ( eqs .",
    "( [ e1e2minusplus ] ) and ( [ e1e2minusminus ] ) ) and they are proportional to @xmath123 .",
    "they also correspond to tensors @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the appendix and as such they can be detected in both @xmath126 and @xmath127 polarizations ( @xmath124 only in @xmath126 ) .",
    "the latters correspond to the tensor @xmath128 in the appendix .",
    "even if proportional to @xmath129 , the signal is not maximized in a backscattering configuration , where it would be zero , because if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both parallel to @xmath130 , then @xmath131 . this signal can be detected only in the @xmath127 channel .",
    "thus , for the pattern depicted in fig .",
    "1b , the preferred geometrical configuration should be when the wave vectors lie in the @xmath132 plane , with @xmath129 along @xmath130 and @xmath123 along @xmath133 , both about 45@xmath134 from the two axes , in order to optimize the projections of @xmath1 and of the outgoing polarization on the @xmath130-axis .",
    "the incoming polarization in the @xmath127 channel is along @xmath135 and the outgoing polarization is in the @xmath132 plane , orthogonal to @xmath2 . in this situation",
    "the only contributions come from the antisymmetric part of @xmath136 and from the symmetric part of @xmath137 .",
    "an azimuthal scan about the @xmath130-axis could reveal the two - fold time - reversal breaking signal with respect to the four - fold time - reversal even one .",
    "these considerations are , of course , subject to the requirement that @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is a bragg vector .    another possibility to detect",
    "the time - reversal breaking signal is to exploit the different polarization dependence of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the former is antisymmetric in the exchange of the two polarizations , while the latter is symmetric .",
    "also the e1-e1 contribution antisymmetric in the polarizations ( ie , @xmath142 ) is zero , because it is proportional to the average magnetic moment on the cu site , while the time - reversal even e1-e2 term , antisymmetric in the polarizations ( ie , @xmath143 ) is imaginary .",
    "therefore , subtracting the signals obtained with switched orthogonal incoming and outgoing polarizations leaves only @xmath144 .",
    "observing the effect requires a sensitivity better than @xmath145 .",
    "the orthorombic phase of la@xmath92sr@xmath93cuo@xmath94 has different symmetries , but the conclusions are similar , as well as the experimental techniques to detect the time - reversal breaking . in the more symmetric phase , due to the buckling of the oxygens , the symmetry around each copper atom is 2/m ( and the space crystal symmetry is cmce ) .",
    "this symmetry is lowered , by the magnetic orbital patterns to @xmath146 or to one of the two magnetoelectric @xmath147/ m , @xmath148 .",
    "for the first case we can apply , even with a lower symmetry , the same considerations as for the @xmath149/mm @xmath97 , while for the two magnetoelectric phases , being also magnetochiral , the same considerations as for m@xmath97 m apply .",
    "we have already discussed the considerations regarding the magnitudes of the intensity of order @xmath62 due to time - reversal breaking .",
    "there is of course a contribution of @xmath150 also .",
    "apart from other considerations of domains noted below , time - reversed domains in the scattering volume are expected to affect adversely the effect of @xmath151 and not of @xmath150 . besides the estimate of the intensity of the signal , it is important to analyze how the geometry of the systems can influence the choice of the experimental technique .",
    "the origin of the time - reversal breaking is due to orbital currents circulating around each copper ion with a well - defined pattern in each cuo@xmath86 plane , as described in ref . [ ] .",
    "the arpes experiments probe only the surface cu - o layers and indicate a surprisingly large domains size , greater than about 10 microns .",
    "if we accept this as correct , the next question concerns the relative order from plane to plane .",
    "the inter - plane coupling is expected to be quite weak and answer to this question can not be reliably obtianed from theoretical considerations .",
    "we shall examine the case of both `` ferromagnetic '' ( fm ) and `` antiferromagnetic '' ( afm ) ordering between the planes .",
    "for all the cases we have examined , the ferromagnetic pattern preserves the size of the primitive cell and the antiferromagnetic pattern changes it .",
    "therefore the `` forbidden '' diffraction spots ( at h+k+l = odd for body - centered tetragonal or body centered orthogonal lattices ) stay `` forbidden '' for the fm pattern but become allowed for the afm patterns",
    ". if the ordering between the planes is random , as is not unlikely , bragg - rods are expected to arise . for the afm pattern",
    "dichroic techniques are useless , as the signal averages to zero in the unit cell . in this case",
    "only x - ray scattering can detect a signal , because the ordinarily forbidden bragg - spots can be revealed by means of linearly polarized light in the e1-e2 channel ( for pattern b of fig .",
    "1 ) . in case",
    "the alignment of successive layers is purely ferromagnetic , it is rather complicated to resolve the magnetic signal with respect to the non - magnetic by x - ray scattering , because of smallness of the former ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "one possible way to perform the experiment in this case is linked to the different azimuthal scan between the normal ( 4-fold periodic ) and the magnetoelectric ( two - fold periodic ) phases , as shown in the following subsection .",
    "probably more appropriate to the case of purely fm ordering is the use of dichroism .    in the next subsection",
    "we shall deal with the specific case of bi-2212 , that is specially note worthy in this respect , since the evidence for the symmetry breaking phase has first been discovered in it.@xcite      the space group given is the tetragonal i4/mmm with two formula units in the cell .",
    "the four cu ions are on the wyckoff sites 4e , whose symmetry is 4 mm , ie , not the full space symmetry of the cell ( full symmetry that is recovered only by the ca ions , on the 2a sites ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the cu ions in a bilayered system like bi-2212 do not have one of the two apical oxygens and thus the /m plane , that is orthogonal to the 4-fold axis is missing . for this reason they have not even a centre of inversion and",
    "the situation is quite different from the mono - layered compound , like hgba@xmath86cuo@xmath90 , where the inversion and the /m plane are present .    from the experiment of kaminski _",
    "et al._@xcite , we can only conclude that the bilayers on the surface cells have currents in phase ( in the examined region ) but nothing can be inferred for phases between different planes in the bulk region .",
    "if we superimpose one of the two current structures , the _ local _ magnetic symmetry on the cu ion is reduced from 4mm@xmath152 to @xmath153 mm ( still tetragonal ) for pattern @xmath154 of fig . 1 , while it is reduced to @xmath155m@xmath156 for pattern @xmath157 . in this latter case",
    "the magnetic symmetry is orthorhombic ( the four - fold axis is lost ) and the mirror planes are no longer orthogonal to the cu - o bonds , but to @xmath133 and @xmath135 of fig .",
    "1b .. we already dealt with the afm case : let us now examine the case when all cuo@xmath86 layers are in phase ( fm ordering ) .",
    "if all the four cu ions have a current pattern of type @xmath154 , the space magnetic symmetry is reduced to @xmath158 mm : the group is still tetragonal and , even if cu sites are not centrosymmetric , there is a global inversion centre in correspondance to the ca ions . because of the global centre of inversion , it is not possible to detect e1-e2 terms in an absorption experiment ( their average gives zero ) .",
    "the only signal is in the e2-e2 channel and its intensity is expected to be very small ( there is an extra factor due to the radial matrix elements of the e2-e2 channel with respect of the e1-e2 , that can be estimated as an extra 0.1 ) .",
    "if all the four cu ions have a current pattern of type @xmath157 , the space magnetic symmetry is reduced to m@xmath156 m , as already seen .",
    "this group does not contain the time - reversal or the inversion as separated symmetries , but it contains their product .",
    "it is a magnetoelectric group ( contrary to the original 4/mmm ) and , as the corresponding magnetoelectric tensor has an antisymmetric off - diagonal part , it admits also magnetochirality .",
    "for this reason this configuration is even more interesting in that it can be revealed by linear ( non - reciprocal ) and magnetochiral dichroism .",
    "here we determine the best geometrical conditions for such experiments .",
    "we refer to fig .",
    "1b and to eqs .",
    "( [ lindice1e2 ] ) , ( [ cirdice1e1 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that for both kind of dichroisms the signal is maximized when the light is shone in the same direction as the anapole , as in both eqs .",
    "( [ lindice1e2 ] ) , ( [ cirdice1e1 ] ) @xmath159 stands for @xmath160 . the anapole , being a time - reversal odd polar vector , is invariant under a parallel mirror symmetry and changes sign if the mirror is orthogonal .",
    "the contrary happens if the mirror is also time - reversed .",
    "it follows that the only invariant direction for such a vector is the one drawn in fig . 1b , orthogonal to the time - reversed mirror plane .",
    "thus , in order to have a non - zero time - reversal odd signal , the light must have a wave vector with a component along this direction . notice that , in this case , a linear dichroism of e1-e1 origin is present , because of the anisotropy of two orthogonal directions within the time - reversed mirror plane , and it is expected to be bigger than the time - reversal breaking one . in order to detect the latter , two experiments must be performed , with opposite magnetoelectric domains : the substraction of the two spectra gives then twice the e1-e2 nrxld , being the e1-e1 xld invariant in the two domains .",
    "similar considerations also hold for the magnetochiral dichroism , ie , in order to maximize the signal , the light must be shone in the direction of the anapole : an useful description of the experiment is then given in ref . [ ] .",
    "finally , the reduction of the group from tetragonal to orthorombic , with the pattern @xmath157 , allows , in principle , the detection of the signal also by means of x - ray resonant scattering .",
    "the trick , as sketched before , is the following : even if all the allowed magnetic reflections correspond to non - magnetic allowed reflections , too , these latter have a four - fold symmetry around the axis orthogonal to the cuo@xmath86 plane .",
    "consider a reflection , like the ( 002 ) , whose exchange vector is directed orthogonal to the cuo@xmath86 planes . in the normal phase , making an azimuthal scan around this vector one obtains a four - fold periodicity , ie , four minima .",
    "the symmetry reduction due to the magnetic pattern ( two - fold ) reduces the number of minima to two .",

    "<S> time - reversal and inversion breaking in the pseudogap region of the cuprate compounds have been proposed and detected by means of arpes in the compound bi-2212 . given the implication of the effect in the physics of the cuprate superconductors , it is important to check the conclusions through quite independent experimental techniques . we show how time - reversal and inversion breaking may be revealed in the cuprates through resonant x - ray scattering and through non - reciprocal or magnetochiral dichroism .    2 </S>"
