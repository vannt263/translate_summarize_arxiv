    "observations of protoplanetary disks around young stars in star - forming regions support the widely accepted idea that planet formation is a common by - product of star formation ( e.g. beckwith 2000 ) .",
    "our solar system may be a typical planetary system in which earth - like planets accrete near the host star from rocky debris depleted of volatile elements , while giant gaseous planets accrete in the ice zones ( @xmath1 au ) around rocky cores ( boss 1995 , lissauer 1996 ) .",
    "when the rocky cores in the ice zones reach a critical mass ( @xmath2 ) runaway gaseous accretion ( formation of jupiters ) begins and continues until a gap in the protoplanetary disk forms or the disk dissipates ( papaloizou and terquem 1999 , habing 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of metals is then a requirement for the formation of both earths and jupiters .",
    "we can not yet verify if our solar system is a typical planetary system or how generic the pattern described above is .",
    "the doppler technique responsible for almost all extrasolar planet detections ( mayor 1995 , butler 2000 and references therein ) is most sensitive to massive close - orbiting planets and is only now becoming able to detect planetary systems like ours , i.e. , jupiters at @xmath1 au from nearby host stars .",
    "the doppler technique has found more than 40 massive ( @xmath3 ) extrasolar planets in close ( @xmath4 au ) , often eccentric orbits around high metallicity host stars ( schneider 2000 ) .",
    "i refer to _ all _ of these giants as ` hot jupiters ' because of their high mass and proximity to their central stars .",
    "approximately 5% of the sun - like stars surveyed possess such giant planets ( marcy and butler 2000 ) .",
    "thus there is room in the remaining 95% for stars to harbour planetary systems like our solar system .",
    "it is not likely that giant planets have formed in situ so close to their host stars ( bodenheimer 2000 ) .",
    "it is more likely that after formation in the ice zone , these giants moved through the habitable zone , destroyed nascent earths ( or precluded their formation ) and are now found close to their host stars ( lin 1996 ) .",
    "how this migration occurred is an active field of research .",
    "however , independent of the details of this migration , recent detections of extrasolar planets are telling us more about where earths are not , than about where earths are .",
    "the aims of this paper are to use the most recent observational data to quantify the metallicity range compatible with the presence of earths and estimate the age distribution of earth - like planets in the universe .",
    "the outline of the analysis is as follows :    1 .",
    "compare the metallicity distribution of stars hosting hot jupiters with the metallicity distribution of stars in the solar neighborhood to obtain the probability of hosting hot jupiters ( and therefore the probability of destroying earths ) 2 .",
    "assume that starting in extremely low metallicity stars , the probability to produce earths increases linearly with metallicity ( this assumption is discussed in section 2.2 ) 3 .",
    "combine items 1 and 2 above to estimate the probability of harbouring earths as a function of metallicity ( fig . 1 ) 4 .",
    "use current estimates of the star formation rate in the universe ( fig .",
    "2a ) and observations of high redshift metallicities to estimate the metallicity distribution of star - forming regions as a function of time ( fig .",
    "combine 3 and 4 above to estimate the age distribution of earth - like planets in the universe ( fig .",
    "figure 1 shows the metallicity distribution of 32 stars hosting hot jupiters whose metallicities have been published ( gonzalez 2000 , table 1 , butler 2000 , table 4 and references therein ) .",
    "the fact that these hosts are significantly more metal - rich than sun - like stars in the solar neighborhood has been reported and discussed in several papers , including gonzalez ( 1997 , 1998 , 2000 ) , ford , rasio and sills ( 1999 ) , queloz ( 2000 ) , butler ( 2000 ) .",
    "the metallicity distribution of sun - like stars in fig .",
    "1 is a linear combination of similar histograms in sommer - larsen ( 1991 ) and rocha - pinto and maciel ( 1996 ) .",
    "these two references were chosen because their g dwarf samples are taken from the solar neighborhood and , although they are not identical to the metallicity distribution of the target stars that have been searched for planets using the doppler technique , they are good representatives of these stars .",
    "let the observed metallicity distribution of the sun - like stars hosting giant planets be @xmath5 , where @xmath6 \\equiv log(fe / h ) - log(fe / h)_{\\odot } \\approx log(z / z_{\\odot})$ ] , and @xmath7 is the mass fraction of metals in the sun . in fig .",
    "1 , the distribution of sun - like stars , @xmath8 , has been normalized so that the 32 host stars represent @xmath9 ( the average planet - finding efficiency given in marcy and butler 2000 ) of the total .",
    "that is , each bin of @xmath8 has been rescaled such that @xmath10 .",
    "target stars have not been selected for metallicity .",
    "although doppler shifts can be measured with slightly more precision in metal - rich stars , and metal - rich stars are slightly brighter for a given spectral type ( leading to a malmquist bias ) , these two selection effects are estimated to be minor compared to the difference between the distributions in fig . 1 ( butler 2000 ) .      for a given metallicity , an estimate of the relative probability that a star will host",
    "a hot jupiter is the ratio of the number of stars hosting hot jupiters to the number of stars targeted ,    = .",
    "this is plotted in fig . 1 and labelled `` probability of destroying earths '' .",
    "at low metallicity , @xmath11 is low and remains low until solar metallicity , where it rises steeply .",
    "this probability predicts that more than @xmath12 of sun - like stars with @xmath13 will have a doppler - detectable hot jupiter , @xmath14 of @xmath15 stars will have one and @xmath16 of solar metallicity stars ( @xmath17 ) will have one .",
    "these predictions are also supported by independent observations :    * a star with extremely high metallicity was included in the target list because of its high metallicity ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "a planet , bd-10 3166 , was found around it ( butler 2000 ) .",
    "this star was not included in fig .",
    "1 because of selection bias , but this result does support the probability calculated here : @xmath19 .",
    "* thirty - four thousand stars in the globular cluster tucanae 47 ( @xmath20 ) were monitored with hst for planets transiting the disks of the hosts .",
    "fifteen or twenty such transits were predicted based on a @xmath16 planet - finding efficiency ( assumed to be independent of metallicity and stellar environment ) . none has been found ( gilliland 2000 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the probability calculated here : @xmath21 , but gilliland ( 2000 ) also suggest that the lack of planets could be due to high stellar densities disrupting planetary stability .    the width of the ` probability of destroying earths ' region has been set by the errors on the terms in eq .",
    "1 . the region is broad enough to contain @xmath11 s calculated when alternative estimates of @xmath8 are used singly or in combination ( e.g. sommer - larsen 1991 , rocha - pinto and maciel 1996 , favata 1997 ) and when a range of planet - finding efficiencies are assumed ( @xmath22 to @xmath23 ) .",
    "thus , the curve is fairly robust to variations in both the estimates of the metallicity distribution of the target stars and to varying estimates of the efficiency of finding hot jupiters .",
    "when larger numbers of hot jupiters are found and the metallicity distribution of the target stars is better known , the new @xmath11 should remain in ( or very close to ) the region labelled `` probability of destroying earths '' in fig",
    "the probability of producing earths is zero at zero metallicity and increases as metals build up in the universe .",
    "the qualitative validity of this idea is broadly agreed upon ( trimble 1997 , whittet 1997 ) but it is difficult to quantify . during star formation ,",
    "varying degrees of fractionation transform a stellar metallicity disk into rocky and gaseous planets .",
    "simulations of terrestrial planet formation by wetherill ( 1996 ) suggest that the mass of rocky planets within 3 au is approximately proportional to the surface density of solid bodies in the protoplanetary disk . in the low surface density regime , ( @xmath24 )",
    ", where finding enough material to make an earth is a problem , the number of planets in the mass range @xmath25 increases roughly in proportion to the surface density , i.e. , to the metallicity .",
    "this increase is not because the overall number of planets increases but because the masses ( of a constant number of planets ) increase , bringing them into the earth - like mass range .",
    "these simulations may be the best evidence we currently have to support the idea that in the low metallicity regime , the probability of forming earths is linearly proportional to metallicity .",
    "this also suggests that the earliest forming earths orbit minimal metallicity stars and are at the low mass end of whatever definition of ` earth - like ' is being used .",
    "similar considerations apply to jupiter formation but at a slightly higher surface density threshold . weidenschilling ( 1998 )",
    "finds that a @xmath26 disk surface density is not quite enough to initiate runaway jupiter formation but that a modest increase in surface density will .",
    "these simulations support the standard core accretion models of planet formation and suggest that planet formation ( both rocky and gaseous ) is enhanced when more metals are available .    in this analysis",
    "i make the simple assumption that the ability to produce earths is zero at low metallicity and increases linearly with metallicity of the host star .",
    "specifically , let @xmath27 be the relative ability to produce earths as a function of metallicity .",
    "i assume that :    * @xmath28 ( earth production is proportional to the abundance of metals ) * @xmath29 .",
    "that is , at very low metal abundance , @xmath30 , the probability of producing earths is @xmath31 . to represent the uncertainty in this zero probability boundary condition , the range @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "this assumption is discussed later . * the most metallic bin , @xmath33 ,",
    "is assigned the probability of 1 : @xmath34 .",
    "the probability of a stellar system harbouring earths , @xmath35 , is the probability of producing earths times the probability of not destroying them , = [ 1- ] .",
    "this probability of harbouring earths is plotted in fig .",
    "1 . starting at low metallicity , it rises linearly and then gets cut off sharply at @xmath36 .",
    "it peaks at @xmath37 , has a mean of @xmath38 and a median of @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath40 confidence range is @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "@xmath35 can be used to focus terrestrial planet search strategies .",
    "for example , to maximize the chances of finding earths , nasa s terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) should look at stars with metallicities within the 68% confidence range and in particular near the peak of @xmath35 . also , since there is a radial metallicity gradient in our galaxy , @xmath35 can be used to define a galactic metallicity - dependent habitable zone analogous to the water - dependent habitable zones around stars .",
    "this can be done by replacing ` @xmath42 ' in eqs . 3 , 4 and 6 with galactic radius",
    "` @xmath43 ' and replacing the @xmath44 with the density of sun - like stars @xmath45 .",
    "the sun ( @xmath46 \\equiv 0 $ ] ) is more metal - rich than @xmath47 of local sun - like stars and less metal - rich than @xmath47 of the stars hosting close - orbiting extrasolar planets .",
    "the high value of @xmath48 ( compared to neighboring stars ) and the low value compared to hot jupiter hosts may be a natural consequence of the goldilocks metallicity selection effect discussed here ( see also gonzalez 1999 ) .",
    "models need to simultaneously explain the presence of hot jupiters close to the host star , the high metallicity of the host stars ( specifically the steepness of the rise in @xmath49 seen in fig .",
    "1 ) as well as the small eccentricities of the closest orbiting planets and the large eccentricities of the planets further out . planet / planet gravitational scattering may provide a natural way to explain these features ( weidenschillling and marzari 1996 , rasio and ford 1996 and lin and ida 1997 ) .",
    "higher metallicity of the protoplanetary disk enhances the mass and/or number of giant planets , thereby enhancing the frequency of gravitational encounters between them .",
    "simulations with up to nine planets have been done ( lin and ida 1997 ) and apparently , `` the more the merrier '' .",
    "that is , the more planets there are , the more likely one is to get scattered into a sub - au orbit .",
    "the least massive planets suffer the largest orbital changes .",
    "thus the least massive are more likely to be ejected , but also are more likely to be gravitationally scattered into orbits with small periastrons which can become partially circularised either by tidal circularization or by the influence of a disk ( provided the disk has not dissipated before the scattering ) .",
    "the observational determination of the star formation rate ( @xmath50 ) of the universe has been the focus of much current work which we summarize in fig .",
    "2 a. various sources indicate a @xmath50 at high redshift an order of magnitude larger than the current @xmath50",
    ". initial estimates in which a peak of star formation was found at redshift @xmath51 are being revised as new evidence indicates that there may be no peak in the star formation rate out to the maximum redshifts available ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "let us restrict our attention to the set of sun - like stars ( spectral types f7 - k1 , in the mass range @xmath53 ) that have ever been born in the universe .",
    "since @xmath16 of the mass that forms stars forms sun - like stars , the star formation rate as a function of time , @xmath44 can be multiplied by @xmath54 to yield the age distribution of sun - like stars in the universe . here",
    ", the standard simplification is made that the stellar initial mass function is constant .",
    "if low mass star formation is suppressed in low metallicity molecular clouds ( nishi and tashiro 2000 ) then the 1.5 gyr delay between @xmath50 and @xmath55 ( section 5 ) is even longer .    if all sun - like stars formed planets irrespective of their metallicity , then the planet formation    rate in the universe would equal @xmath56 , shown in fig .",
    "2a . however , fig .",
    "1 indicates that metallicity is a factor which should be taken into account .",
    "thus , we estimate the earth - like planet formation rate , @xmath57 , orbiting sun - like stars as    pfr(t ) = a sfr(t ) f(t ) ,    where @xmath58 is the fraction of stars being formed at time @xmath42 which are able to harbour earths .",
    "if all sun - like stars formed planets and metallicity had no effect on terrestrial planet formation , we would have @xmath59 . if we knew",
    "that on average one out of every thousand sun - like stars had an earth - like planet , ( and this number did not depend on the metallicity of the star ) , then the planet formation rate would be @xmath60 , which is just a rescaling of the @xmath50 in fig .",
    "a plausible first approximation could have @xmath61 .",
    "that is , the higher the average metallicity of the universe , the higher the efficiency with which star formation produces earths . in this analysis , however , this guess is improved on by taking into account the dispersion of metallicity of star forming regions around the mean at any given time , as well as by including the metallicity dependent selection effect for harbouring earths . when these are taken into consideration , @xmath58 becomes an integral over metallicity ,    f(t ) p ( , ( t ) ) d ,    where @xmath62 was derived above and @xmath63 is a gaussian parametrisation of the metallicity distribution of star - forming regions in the universe ( eq .",
    "the universe started off with zero metallicity and a complete inability to form earths .",
    "the metallicity of the universe gradually increased as a result of star formation and its by - products : various types of stellar novae and stellar winds .",
    "various observations form a consistent picture of the gradual increasing metallicity of the universe ( fig .",
    "the star formation rate plays a dual role in this analysis since stars make planets ( @xmath64 , eq .",
    "3 ) and stars make metals , @xmath65 .",
    "integration of this last proportionality yields the increasing mean metallicity , @xmath66 , of star forming regions in the universe _",
    "0^t sfr(t)dt ~(t ) .    the resulting @xmath66 ,",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "2b ( thick line ) .",
    "the grey area around @xmath66 reflects the spread in the estimates of the @xmath50 ( grey area in @xmath67 ) .",
    "metallicity observations in our galaxy and at large redshifts are available to check the plausibility of this integral and are shown in fig .",
    "2b .    at any given time @xmath42 , some star forming regions have low metallicity while some have high metallicity .",
    "we parametrize this spatial dispersion around the mean by a time - dependent gaussian centered on @xmath66 :    p(,(t ) ) = exp [ ] .",
    "the current metallicity distribution of ob stars in the thin disk ( gummersbach 1998 ) , which may be our best estimate of the current mean metallicity of star - forming regions in the universe , is used to normalize this function , @xmath68 , and provide the dispersion , @xmath69 .",
    "performing the integral in eq .",
    "4 and inserting the result into eq . 3 yields an estimate of the terrestrial planet formation rate in the universe which is also the age distribution of earths orbiting sun - like stars in the universe .",
    "this distribution is plotted in fig . 2c and indicates that the average age of earths around sun - like stars is @xmath70 billion years .",
    "the error bar represents the uncertainty in the @xmath50 ( shown in fig .",
    "2a ) as well as the range of assumptions about the low metallicity tail of @xmath71 , discussed below .",
    "thus , the average earth in the universe is @xmath0 billion years older than our earth . and ,",
    "if life exists on some of these earths , it will have evolved , on average , @xmath72 billion years longer than we have on earth . among these earths ,",
    "@xmath73 are older than our earth while @xmath74 are younger .",
    "@xmath40 of earths in the universe are between @xmath75 and @xmath76 gyr old while @xmath12 are between @xmath77 and @xmath78 gyr old .",
    "the time delay between the onset of star formation and the onset of terrestrial planet formation is the difference between the x - intercept of the thin and thick solid lines in fig .",
    "2c . this delay is @xmath79 gyr and has an important dependence on the low metallicity tail of @xmath62 , specifically , on the metallicity for which @xmath80 has been assumed . to estimate the dependence of the main result on this assumption , both a high and a low metallicity case ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 )",
    "have been considered .",
    "that is , i have used the two boundary conditions @xmath83 and @xmath84 and the variation they produce in the result , to compute representative error bars .",
    "the resulting variation is about one half of the variation due to the uncertainty in the @xmath50 .",
    "if rocky planets can easily form around stars with extremely low metallicity due to high levels of fractionation during planet formation , then the lower limit used here , @xmath85 , may not be low enough .",
    "these linear metallicity variations yield error estimates but other possibilities exist .",
    "the masses of earth - like planets and the ability of a stellar system to produce them may not be linear functions of metallicity .",
    "for example , there may be a strongly non - linear dependence on metallicity such as a metallicity threshold below which earths do not form and above which they always do .",
    "if that were the case then the @xmath55 plotted in fig . 2c",
    "would shift to the right or left depending on where the threshold is .    in this analysis",
    "i have assumed that the moons of hot jupiters do not accrete into earth - like planets .",
    "this speculation has not been explored in any detail . if true , hot jupiters would destroy earths , but would also help create alternative sites for life . however , the delayed onset of planet formation compared to star formation derived here would be largely unchanged .",
    "the cratering history of the moon tells us that the earth underwent an early intense bombardment by planetesimals and comets from its formation 4.56 gyr ago until @xmath86 gyr ago . for the first 0.5 gyr ,",
    "the bombardment was so intense ( temperatures so high ) that the formation of early life may have been frustrated ( maher and stevensen 1988 ) . the earliest isotopic evidence for life dates from the end of this heavy bombardment @xmath87 billion years ago ( mojzsis 1996 ) .",
    "thus , life on earth seems to have arisen as soon as temperatures permitted ( lazcano and miller 1994 ) .    to interpret fig . 2c as the age distribution for life in the universe several assumptions need to be made . among them",
    "are :    1 .",
    "life is based on molecular chemistry and can not be based on just hydrogen and helium .",
    "2 .   the dominant harbours for life in the universe are on the surfaces of earths in classical habitable zones .",
    "3 .   other time - dependent selection effects which promote or hamper the formation of life ( supernovae rate ?",
    ", gamma ray bursts ? , cluster environments ? ) are not as important as the metallicity selection effect discussed here ( norris 2000 ) .",
    "life is long - lived .",
    "if life goes extinct on planets then the @xmath55 needs to have its oldest tail chopped off to represent only existing life .",
    "this paper is an attempt to piece together a consistent scenario from the most recent observations of extrasolar planets , the star formation rate of the universe and the metallicity evolution of the star - forming regions of the universe .",
    "the precision of all of these data sets is improving rapidly . with more than 2000 stars",
    "now being surveyed , we expect more than @xmath88 giant planets to be detected in the next few years .",
    "the metallicities of target lists are also under investigation .",
    "thus , the uncertainties in the metallicities of target stars and stars hosting planets will be reduced ( reducing the error bars in both the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "planet / planet interactions may explain the hot jupiter / high metallicity correlation but at least two other ( non - mutually exclusive ) explanations exist : 1 ) metallicity enhanced migration of giants in protoplanetary disks ( e.g. murray 1998 ) and 2 ) infall of metal - rich accretion disks onto the host stars , precipitated by the in - spiraling of large planets ( e.g. gonzalez 1998 , quellin and holman 2000 ) .",
    "the infall of metallicity - enhanced material probably occurs in all migration or interaction scenarios .",
    "however , if the outer convective zones of g dwarfs are thick enough to mix and dilute this material ( laughlin and adams 1999 ) then the analysis done here requires no significant modification for metallicity enhancement .",
    "if the dilution is not effective then the observed metallicity of a star will not be a faithful indicator of the star s true metallicity and therefore will not be a good indicator of the probability to produce earths as assumed here .",
    "the results obtained here for the metallicity and age distributions of earth - like planets in the universe are easily testable . over the next decade or two",
    ", intensive efforts will be focused on finding earths in the solar neighborhood .",
    "microsecond interferometry ( sim ) and even higher angular resolution infrared interferometry ( tpf & irsi - darwin ) as well as micro - lensing planet searches ( planet ) and high sensitivity transit photometry ( corot ) all have the potential to detect earth - like planets .",
    "these efforts will eventually yield metalllicity and age distributions for the host stars of earth - like planets that can be compared to figs . 1 and 2c .",
    "in addition , figs . 1 and 2c can be used to focus these efforts .",
