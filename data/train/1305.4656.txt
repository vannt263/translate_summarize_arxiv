    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are believed to be the sites of galactic cosmic - ray acceleration by the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ; bell 1978 ; blandford & ostriker 1978 ) . however , owing to large ambiguity of magnetic field that plays essential role in the dsa by scattering particles , detailed process of the dsa remains a matter of debate .",
    "polarization observations of synchrotron emissions can be crucially important , since they have variety of information about the magnetic field in the snrs .",
    "it has been suggested by radio polarization observations that the magnetic fields in some young snrs are oriented radially ( dickel et al .",

    "jun & norman ( 1996 ) studied the rayleigh - taylor instability ( rti ) at the contact surface in the snr .",
    "they found that the growth of the rti causes the radially oriented magnetic field , because the rti driven turbulence is biased toward the radial component .",
    "although the rti provides a promising origin of magnetic field orientation in the snrs , it can work only in the vicinity of the contact surface ( see , however , schure et al .",
    "2009 ) , while the observations suggest radial orientation even in the region of shocked interstellar medium ( ism ) ahead of the contact ( e.g. , reynoso et al .",
    "the richtmyer - meshkov instability ( rmi ) may solve the puzzle of the magnetic field orientation in the snrs , because the rmi is a rayleigh - taylor type instability that is induced by the interaction between the shock and density fluctuations in the ism , i.e. , the rmi can grow even at the downstream of the forward shock .",
    "the role of the rmi in the snr has recently been studied using magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations .",

    "we solve the adiabatic ideal mhd equations for the gas with adiabatic index @xmath13 and mean molar weight @xmath14 , because we are interested in the young snrs in the late free - expansion phase .",
    "the basic mhd equations are solved using the second - order godunov - type finite - volume scheme ( van leer 1979 ) that employs an approximate mhd riemann solver developed by sano et al .",
    ". the consistent method of characteristics with the constrained transport technique ( clarke 1996 ) is used for solving the induction equations that ensures the divergence free constraint .",
    "the integration is done in the conservative fashion , so that we can handle high - mach - number shock waves precisely .",
    "since we consider the adiabatic ideal mhd , the results of the simulations are scale - free .",
    "the physical scale is introduced when we fix the scale of density fluctuations given below . in the following , for intuitive presentation",
    ", we express the scale of the system using physical scales .",
    "we prepare a cubic numerical domain of the volume @xmath15 that is composed of 1024@xmath16 uniform unit cells .",
    "because the snrs that show radially oriented magnetic field seem to be located in the diffuse ism , we consider so - called the `` big - power - law - in - the - sky '' ( armstrong et al .",
    "1995 ) as an origin of the density fluctuations in the preshock ism .",
    "the fluctuations are given as a superposition of sinusoidal functions with various wave numbers that range @xmath17 and random phases .",
    "the power spectrum of the density fluctuations is given as the isotropic power law : @xmath18 for the above range of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fourier component of the density , which is consistent with the big - power - law - in - the - sky .",
    "thus , our initial density structure is parameterized by mean density @xmath21 and dispersion @xmath22 .",
    "we set the mean number density , the initial thermal pressure , and the initial magnetic field strength to be @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 k @xmath24 and @xmath26 g , respectively , which are the typical values in the diffuse ism ( myers 1978 ; beck 2000 ) .",
    "thus , the initial mean sound speed and alfvn velocity are @xmath27 km s@xmath28 and @xmath29 km s@xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the model parameters ( the initial degree of the fluctuation and the initial orientation of magnetic field ) are summarized in table 1 .",
    "if we suppose the turbulence in the diffuse ism is driven by supernovae , the driving - scale of the turbulence and the degree of density fluctuation at the driving - scale would be given as @xmath30 pc and @xmath31 , respectively ( e.g. , de avillez & breitschwerdt 2007 ) .",
    "in that case , the degree of small - scale density fluctuations due to cascade of the turbulence at the scale @xmath32 pc is estimated as @xmath33 , where we have used the relation @xmath34 . hence , we regard models 1 and 2 as fiducial ism models .    to induce a blast wave that generates a shocked layer",
    ", we set a hot plasma of @xmath35 k @xmath24 , @xmath36 @xmath24 and @xmath37 @xmath2 g at the @xmath38 boundary plane . according to the solution of the riemann problem , when the preshock density takes uniform value of @xmath39 @xmath24",
    ", such a hot gas induces a shock wave of @xmath40 km s@xmath28 , indicating that mean shock velocity induced by the hot gas is @xmath41 km s@xmath28 .",
    "we use the periodic boundary conditions for the @xmath42-@xmath43 and the @xmath42-@xmath44 boundary planes , and we assume free boundary condition at the @xmath45 boundary plane . in the young snrs such as tycho , kepler , and sn1006 , the shock speed does not vary substantially , since the snrs would be in the late free - expansion phase .",
    "in addition , our numerical domain ( @xmath46 pc ) is smaller than the curvature of the young snrs ( @xmath47 pc ) .",
    "thus , the dynamical effect of the curvature can be omitted . to study the effect of the shock strength",
    ", we also perform the run named model 1f that is similar to model 1 with twice the shock speed ( @xmath48 km s@xmath28 ) by enhancing @xmath49 by a factor of four .",
    "in figure  [ f1 ] , we show a two - dimensional slice of the magnetic field strength ( _ upper half _ ) and the number density ( _ lower half _ ) of the result of model 1 at @xmath50 yr .",
    "interaction between the blast wave shock and the density fluctuations results in an induction of turbulence , where the magnetic field is amplified beyond the shock compression value of @xmath51 @xmath2 g for the perpendicular shocks propagating into uniform medium .",
    "top panel of figure  [ f2 ] shows evolution of the average magnetic field strength @xmath52 and the dispersion @xmath53 in the shocked layer . here",
    "@xmath54 represents the mean value in the shocked region where @xmath55 k @xmath24 and @xmath56 @xmath24 ( the former and latter conditions exclude the preshock ism and the hot ejecta component , respectively ) .",
    "one can find more detailed descriptions about the rmi driven turbulence ( or the effect of rippled shock in another expression ) and resulting dynamo effect in many literatures ( e.g. , giacalone & jokipii 2007 ; inoue et al .",
    "2012 ; fraschetti 2013 ) .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ f2 ] shows , for the perpendicular shock models , the velocity dispersion in the shocked layer @xmath57 and the dispersion of magnetic field strength @xmath58 at @xmath50 yr as functions of the preshock density dispersion .",
    "if we apply the result of a simple linear analysis by richtmyer ( 1960 ) , the velocity dispersion of shocked density fluctuations that is essentially given by the growth velocity of the rmi can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 corresponds to the atwood number and @xmath61 is the ellipticity of the fluctuations that is zero for the isotropic inhomogeneity ( see nishihara et al .",

    "we assume @xmath73 and the relativistic electrons are uniformly distributed in the shocked region ( @xmath74const . ) .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] shows the structure of polarization degree @xmath75 ( colors ) and the magnetic field orientation vectors derived from the polarization angle @xmath76 ( bars ) observed along the @xmath44-axis .",
    "panels ( a)-(d ) correspond to the results of model 1 - 4 , respectively .",
    "we see that the orientation angle to the @xmath42-axis @xmath77 decrease with distance from the shock , even in the cases of the perpendicular shock .",
    "in particular , substantial fraction of the orientation vectors are aligned almost radially ( @xmath42-direction ) in the results of @xmath78 ( panels [ a ] and [ d ] ) .",
    "note that the l.o.s .",
    "direction along @xmath44-axis corresponds to the situation in which the expectation value of the polarization angle to the @xmath42-axis @xmath79 is the largest in any other l.o.s . direction . in table  1",
    ", we list the average polarization angles for the cases of the l.o.s . along @xmath44-axis ( @xmath4 ) and the l.o.s . along @xmath43-axis ( @xmath4 ) , in which the average is taken in the region of @xmath80 where the effect of turbulence is active . in the models of @xmath81 , both angles are smaller than that of the isotropic case : @xmath82 .",
    "the mechanism for this transition of the orientation vector can be explained as follows : in the bottom panel of figure  [ f2 ] , we plot the ratio of @xmath83 dispersion to the average value of @xmath84 and @xmath85 dispersions [ @xmath86 ( _ solid _ ) and the ratio of the average strength of @xmath87 to the average value of @xmath88 and @xmath89 strengths [ @xmath90 ( _ dotted _ ) .",
    "we see that the velocity dispersion is anisotropic that is biased toward @xmath42-component .",
    "this indicates that the turbulence , which stretches and amplifies magnetic field lines , works selectively for the @xmath42-component magnetic field . as a result , the magnetic field orientation shifts to the @xmath42-direction .",
    "note that , since the isotropic component of the magnetic field is averaged out by the l.o.s .",
    "integration , the radial orientation of the magnetic field appears even if the anisotropy of the magnetic field strength is weak .",
    "this mechanism is essentially the same as the rti case at the contact surface studied by jun & norman ( 1996 ) , and possibly explains small dispersion of dust emission / absorption polarization angles in molecular clouds as discussed in inoue & inutsuka ( 2012 ) . as for model 3 ( @xmath91 )",
    ", the anisotropy of magnetic field strength @xmath92 do not exceed unity in 800 yr evolution due to the smaller velocity dispersion .",
    "this results in the insufficient polarization transition in the panel ( c ) .",
    "the mean polarization degrees @xmath9 at @xmath50 yr are exhibited in table 1 .",
    "the polarization degree of @xmath93-@xmath94% in the shocked layer for the cases of @xmath95 agrees with the radio polarization observations of young snrs ( dickel et al . 1991 ; delaney et al . 2002 ; reynolds & gilmore 1993 ; reynoso et al . 2013 ) .",
    "these lower polarization degrees @xmath9 compared to the homogeneous magnetic field case of @xmath96% for the standard dsa electron spectrum is clearly attributed to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field .    because the transition of polarization angle is caused by the anisotropic turbulent dynamo effect , larger velocity dispersion of turbulence results in a smaller transition length of the polarization angle .",
    "the transition lengths of the polarization angle for the perpendicular shock cases are @xmath97 pc for model 1 ( @xmath98 ) , 0.25 pc for model 4 ( @xmath99 ) , 0.23 pc for model 5 ( @xmath100 ) , and 0.23 pc for model 6 ( @xmath101 ) . here",
    "the transition length is defined as the average distance from the shock front at which polarization angle becomes @xmath102 .",
    "note that the transition lengths are converged at @xmath103 yr within @xmath104% deviations from the above values .",
    "we also confirmed that the transition length are converged within @xmath104% deviations , even if we employed @xmath105 .    in the present set of problem , the distribution of magnetic field that determines @xmath106 , and @xmath107 is passive to the turbulence .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the turbulence is described by eq .",
    "( [ vrmi ] ) , and the characteristic scale of the turbulent modification of the magnetic field can be written as ( richtmyer 1960 ; sano et al .",
    "2012 ) @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the downstream velocity and @xmath110 is the shock compression ratio .",
    "it is widely known that @xmath110 converges quickly to the value of four for the high mach number shock in the monoatomic gas .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ lrmi ] ) indicates that the modification scale of the magnetic field is insensitive to the mach number or the shock velocity .",
    "the result of model 1f , which is similar to model 1 except the shock velocity is doubled ( @xmath111 km s@xmath28 ) , confirms the insensitivity of @xmath106 , and @xmath107 to the shock velocity ( see , table 1 ) .",
    "can the rmi driven turbulence account for the observed radially oriented magnetic fields in the young snrs ?",
    "recent radio polarization observation of sn1006 has shown that the magnetic field orientations in southwest ( sw ) and southeast ( se ) regions seem to be shifted from perpendicular ( to the shock normal ) to parallel ( reynoso et al . 2013 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , these two regions show different features : in the sw region , where @xmath112 and non - thermal x - ray emission is bright , the transition length of the polarization angle is apparently @xmath113 that corresponds to @xmath114 pc for the distance @xmath115 kpc ( see , figure  3 of reynoso et al .",
    "2013).on the other hand , in the se , the transition length is apparently @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) pc , where the polarization degree is high @xmath118 and the non - thermal x - ray emission is faint .    as we have discussed in  2 that the upstream density dispersion of @xmath119 ( for @xmath32 pc ) may be the standard fluctuation amplitude in the diffuse ism .",
    "if so , the transition length of the polarization angle is @xmath120 pc ( table 1 ) that is comparable to that of the se region of sn1006",
    ". the averaged polarization degree of our fiducial model ( model 1 ) @xmath121 is much smaller than the se value of @xmath118 .",
    "however , the polarization degree of the se region is measured only near the rim due to the faint emission .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] indicates that the polarization degree at the rim of the shock is also large ( @xmath122 ) in our model .",
    "therefore , model 1 is consistent with the se region of sn1006 .    as for the sw region ,",
    "the transition length of the fiducial model ( @xmath120 pc ) is larger than that measured by the observation(@xmath123 pc ) .",
    "in addition , even at the rim of the shell , the polarization degree of the sw is low ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "even if the amplitude of the fluctuations is much larger than the fiducial model ( @xmath124 ) , the velocity dispersion of induced turbulence can be at most as large as the cases of models 4 - 6 , because the induced velocity dispersion saturates at @xmath125 ( see , mid panel of figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the larger density inhomogeneity does not substantially shorten the transition length ( see , table 1 ) and the thickness of the rim with @xmath126 ( see , figure  [ f3 ] )",
    ".    the observed transition length of the southwest region of sn1006 can be much smaller than 0.1 pc ( @xmath127 ) , since it is comparable to the scale of beam spread . in that case",
    ", we have interesting options to address the scale discrepancy between the theory and the observation of the sw region as follows : as we have mentioned in  2 , since our mechanism is based on the scale - free ideal mhd phenomenon , we can expect smaller scale polarization shift , if there are small - scale fluctuations with sufficient amplitude .",
    "in other words , if we re - normalize the scale of our numerical domain to be 1/10th of our choice , the same result with the 1/10th of spatial and temporal scales without changing other variables is obtained .",
    "we can reasonably expect large - amplitude small - scale density fluctuations around the young snr shock , if the cosmic - ray acceleration is efficient .",
    "for instance , the drury instability can be an origin of the large - amplitude small - scale density fluctuations , which amplifies preexistent sound waves in the precursor of the cosmic - ray modified shock ( drury & falle 1986 ) .",
    "also , recent particle - in - cell simulations have shown that the cosmic - ray streaming instability ( e.g , bell 2004 ) causes density fluctuations in the upstream region in its non - linear stage ( riquelme & spitkovsky 2009 ; niemiec et al .",
    "2008 ; ohira et al .",
    "in addition , the density fluctuations could be produced by pickup ions originated in hydrogen atoms ( ohira & takahara 2010 ; ohira 2012 ) .    in the case of the drury instability , the most unstable scales of the acoustic waves are ( malkov et al .",
    "2010 ) @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the cosmic - rays pressure gradient in the shock precursor . as for the non - linear stage of the cosmic - ray streaming instability ,",
    "the typical scale is given by ( bell 2004 ) @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the cosmic - ray current density and @xmath132 is the upstream magnetic field strength amplified by the instability that can be measured via the thickness of thin synchrotron shell . since the typical scale of the rmi given in eq .",
    "( [ lrmi ] ) roughly gives the transition length ( @xmath133 ) , once the scale of the transition length is measured with sufficient resolution , we can recover the scale of the drury instability or the cosmic - ray streaming instability by substituting @xmath134 or @xmath135 for @xmath136 .",
    "this method potentially enable us to measure the cosmic - ray pressure gradient : @xmath137 or the cosmic - ray number density : @xmath138 by observations .",
