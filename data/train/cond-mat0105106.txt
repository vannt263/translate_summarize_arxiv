    "the properties of magnetic nanoparticles and fine particle assemblies have been attracting the interest of physicists for many decades . below a critical size such nanoscopic magnetic systems",
    "develop new properties that can not be found in macroscopic systems , where the material is divided into domains in order to decrease the magnetostatic energy .",
    "stoner and wohlfarth @xcite laid the theoretical basis , which are widely used nowadays , to describe such low dimensional systems and predicted new effects like the superparamagnetism .",
    "according to the stoner - wohlfarth s model , the strong exchange interaction aligns all the particle spins so that the magnetization inside the nanoparticle is assumed to be a uniform field , which rotates coherently due to the presence of an external magnetic field . despite being a suitable assumption for homogeneous systems , it is not appropriate to describe heterogeneous particles , for instance , formed by regions of localized moments having distinct magnetic character ( ferromagnetic , ferrimagnetic , and antiferromagnetic ) . for such heterogeneous systems",
    "the exchange energy plays a central role in determining the magnetization of the nanoparticle @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the non - trivial interaction among the spins is responsible for a highly correlated behavior that is very difficult to describe in terms of analytical expressions or exact numerical solutions , for a general case .",
    "in addition , the boundary conditions imposed by the finite size of the nanoparticles and surface disorder complicate otherwise simpler solutions for infinite systems .    in most experiments the magnetization due to an ensemble of nanoparticles is the measured parameter . in this case",
    "the long range dipolar interaction is dominant ; it produces a collective energy barrier for the magnetization reversal of a nanoparticle and , consequently , sets a new time scale for irreversible processes @xcite .",
    "the magnetization of independent nanoparticles being experimentally accessible in the limit of very dilute particle ensembles .",
    "however , a series of recent experiments , using a micro - squid technique , have demonstrated the possibility of measuring both the magnetization reversal mechanism and dynamics of individual homogeneous nanoparticles ( 10 - 20 nm in diameter ) @xcite and cobalt nanoclusters ( 3 - 5 nm in diameter ) @xcite .",
    "the formalism presented in this paper should provide a theoretical foundation for experiments made on single ( or independent ) heterogeneous nanoparticles .",
    "magnetic systems are well known for developing long range interactions , specially in the continuous phase transitions , where the correlation length is infinite . because of that the calculation of critical exponents require sophisticated theoretical formalisms such as renormalization group techniques or high temperature series expansions , or numerical methods such as the monte carlo . on the other hand , away from the critical point , where the correlation length decays exponentially , a mean field theory may provide a good description of the behavior of the system .",
    "nevertheless , the plain mean field approach corresponds to one in which there is no correlation between any pair of spins and a given spin interacts with the average magnetization of its neighbors or , equivalently , with an effective mean field produced by all the spins in the system .",
    "this simplified approach might fail however for nanoparticles having a core with magnetic properties that differ from those of the surface , as in the instance of a ferromagnetic particle coated by a ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic layer @xcite , caused by oxidation processes , or the case of a disordered surface as well @xcite . for these systems",
    "the correlations between neighbors are important to establish boundaries between regions of different magnetic properties .    in this work",
    "we propose a new method to describe the classical magnetic properties of non - interacting nanoparticles .",
    "the method takes a further step from the standard mean field approach and treats the nearest neighbor pair correlations between spins within the particle explicitly , therefore being capable of describing heterogeneous systems . in spite of being extensively used to calculate the magnetic properties of infinite systems , the bethe - peierls ( also called pair )",
    "approximation has not yet been used to calculate the magnetic properties of nanoparticles .",
    "a somewhat similar approach was used to describe the magnetization of fe quasi-1d clusters @xcite , in view of the fact that the results obtained by the bethe - peierls approximation agree with the ising solution for 1d systems @xcite . in the following the details of the model and the formalism",
    "are presented .",
    "then , in the remainder of the paper , it is shown that the model accounts for many of the properties of magnetic nanoparticle systems .",
    "at first , consider a two - dimensional ( 2d ) array of ising spins in an hexagonal lattice , as depicted in figure 1 for a structure made up of 3 shells .",
    "a similar model system could be used to describe the properties of single - crystalline disks with hexagonal contour , as the 10 - 20 nm bafecotio nanoparticles whose magnetization reversal has been measured @xcite .",
    "we note that the formalism applies equally well for any 2d lattice and can be extended to tridimensional ( 3d ) lattices as well .",
    "taking advantage of the sixfold rotational symmetry of the lattice , we need to consider only a small subset of spins ( marked @xmath0 through @xmath1 by filled dots in fig .",
    "1 ) to provide the magnetization of the whole particle .",
    "each of the spin sites , which stand for the atomic moments in the nanoparticle , are described by ising spin variables that take on values @xmath2 .",
    "the nanoparticle is assumed to be very small , so that it constitutes a monodomain .",
    "in addition , according to experimental results @xcite , an uniaxial anisotropy is implicit in the model , with the easy axis coinciding with the ising spin direction .",
    "therefore the energy of the system is written as @xmath3 where only the exchange coupling between nearest neighbors is considered , with @xmath4 as the exchange coupling constant , and @xmath5 is the applied magnetic field .",
    "having defined the relevant spins that describe the system we start by writing the dynamical equations for the average spin magnetizations @xmath6 and the pair correlation functions @xmath7 where the index @xmath8 , as well as @xmath9 , designates a spin site and the sum over @xmath10 accounts for all the spin configurations .",
    "since we restrict our model to take into account only pair correlations , the probability of a given spin configuration is written as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total number of spins .",
    "the time evolution of the system is obtained by means of the master equation for the probabilities @xmath13 with @xmath14 as the transition probability per unit time from the spin configuration @xmath15 to configuration @xmath10 . here",
    "we assume that the dynamics of the system is governed by single - spin - flip transitions , which can be mathematically described by the glauber formalism @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17 } \\\\   & \\equiv &   \\tanh{(\\delta_{i } ) } ,   \\label{gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath19 is the absolute temperature and @xmath20 is the relaxation time for a single spin .",
    "this dynamical rule is chosen so that the transition probabilities @xmath21 depend on the spin value of @xmath22 as well as on the values of its nearest neighbors .",

    "this is done in the appendix .",
    "in this section we describe the properties of the model and show that it accounts for many of the phenomena presented by magnetic nanoparticle systems .",
    "we start by discussing the properties of the hysteresis of homogeneous ferromagnetic nanoparticles , as yielded by the present model . for this purpose consider figure 3(a ) where it is shown hysteresis loops for 3 different nanoparticle sizes @xmath53 = 1 , 2 and 11 .",
    "@xmath53 is the number of shells and can be associated with the radius of the nanoparticle .",
    "we define the total magnetization of the nanoparticle @xmath54 , where the sum runs over all the spins of the nanoparticle ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the smallest nanoparticle ( @xmath53 = 1 ) has vanishing coercive field and its magnetization is well fitted by a langevin function , whereas the bigger particles ( @xmath53 = 2 through 11 ) exhibit typical hysteresis loops of ferromagnetic nanoparticles .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the dependency of the coercive field ( @xmath55 ) on the number of shells of the nanoparticle , by plotting @xmath55 as a function of @xmath56 , for the reduced temperature @xmath57 .",
    "this graph demonstrates that the functional relation @xmath58 fits very well the results of our calculations for nanoparticles of size @xmath59 , with the exception of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 cases .",
    "the former is in the superparamagnetic regime @xcite , as indicated by fig .",
    "3(a ) , whereas the last already starts to behave as an infinite system .",
    "the same behavior exhibited by @xmath55 in fig 3(b ) is obtained for the reduced temperature @xmath62 . according to our calculations , for @xmath63 the curie temperature ( @xmath64 ) of the nanoparticle coincides with the @xmath64 of an infinite cubic system , as yielded by the bethe - peierls relation @xmath65 } = 5 $ ] @xcite .",
    "calculations for a square lattice showed that @xmath66 for small clusters , where @xmath67 stands for its lateral dimension .",
    "finally , we point out that the mechanism of magnetization reversal that takes place in our nanoparticle is not entirely coherent . because of their smaller coordination number ,",
    "the average magnetization ( @xmath68 ) of the outside spin shells decrease by the action of the reverse field @xmath5 , consequently also decreasing the magnetization of their neighboring shells and creating a nonuniform magnetization profile . eventually , when @xmath5 reaches @xmath55 all the spins flip together",
    ". this process should be responsible for easier magnetization rotation and lower switching fields than those given by the stoner - wohlfarth model .",
    "in the remainder of this section we consider the properties of heterogeneous nanoparticles , which are more complex systems consisting of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ( or ferrimagnetic ) regions coupled with each other .",
    "examples of such systems are oxide - coated cobalt ( co ) or iron ( fe ) nanoparticles @xcite , among many others that exhibit the exchange anisotropy effect @xcite .",
    "when cooled in the presence of an external magnetic field the soft ferromagnetic core of the particle aligns with the applied field but its outer antiferromagnetic ( af ) surface gets ordered only when the temperature of the system is lower than @xmath69 ( nel temperature ) @xcite .",
    "the coupling of the ferromagnetic core with the antiferromagnetic surface therefore produces a unidirectional exchange anisotropy that shifts the hysteresis loop to higher or lower magnetic fields , depending on their mutual orientation . to obtain this effect we consider an 8-shell nanoparticle with the following characteristics : the exchange interactions in the core ( @xmath53 = 0 to 7 ) are given by the coupling parameter @xmath70 , the outmost shell ( @xmath71 ) is also ferromagnetic with an exchange constant @xmath72 and the coupling between the @xmath73 and @xmath71 shells is due to an antiferromagnetic exchange constant @xmath74 .",
    "the hysteresis we obtain with our formalism is shown in figure 4(a ) , which presents a clear exchange shift .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows the magnetization curves of individual spins within the nanoparticle : in the center of the nanoparticle ( @xmath75 ) , in the sixth shell ( @xmath76 ) , in the seventh shell ( @xmath77 ) and in the surface shell ( @xmath78 ) . as evidenced by this graph ,",
    "the surface shell and the layer just below it are locked in a very stable af configuration , whereas the average magnetization of the inner ferromagnetic shells vary gradually towards the center of the particle . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we have also calculated the hysteresis for the same system , but using a simple mean field approach , whose results are shown in figures 4(c ) and 4(d ) . for the standard mean field equations each spin experiences only an effective field that can be seen as an average interaction with all the other spins and , consequently , the exchange shift disappears .",
    "looking at the individual spin magnetizations ( fig .",
    "4(d ) ) it is evident that there is no correlation between the surface and core domains .",
    "another important experimental technique used to investigate the properties of magnetic nanoparticles is the field cooling ( fc ) and zero field cooling ( zfc ) magnetization measurements . for an ensemble of",
    "non - interacting homogeneous particles the blocking temperature ( @xmath79 ) is related to the magnetic anisotropy constant and the volume of the nanoparticle @xcite . for a system of interacting nanoparticles",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the blocking temperature , where the maximum of the zfc curve occurs , indicates the point in which the thermal energy is comparable to the average anisotropy barrier in the nanoparticles , and beyond it the magnetization decreases with temperature . in the following we show a deblocking behavior that is caused only by the exchange interaction between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic regions in a single nanoparticle . for that purpose",
    "consider a 6-shell nanoparticle whose core is predominantly af , @xmath80 for @xmath53 = 0 to 5 , with a ferromagnetic surface , @xmath81 for @xmath53 = 6 , which is ferromagnetically coupled with the core , @xmath82 between @xmath53 = 5 and @xmath53=6 .",
    "the energy parameter is @xmath83 and the time taken to sweep over the whole temperature interval is @xmath84 , with @xmath20 appearing in eqs ( [ mean ] ) and ( [ pair ] ) .",
    "the calculations were performed in accordance with the standard fc - zfc experimental practice @xcite .",
    "the obtained fc ( solid line ) and zfc ( dashed line ) magnetization curves are shown in figures 5(a ) through 5(f ) as a function of the reduced temperature , for values of the applied field that vary from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 is the normalized magnetization of the entire nanoparticle , as previously defined . because it corresponds to a single particle , @xmath79",
    "is sharply marked and does not exhibit the characteristic dispersion caused by the size distribution of the particles . according to our calculations ,",
    "@xmath79 is not strongly dependent on @xmath88 however it does depend on @xmath89 and @xmath88 .",
    "figure 5 shows that the blocking temperature occurs just about the range @xmath90 , which is confirmed for different nanoparticle parameters ( size , exchange constant and @xmath91 ) . despite being observed to take place for nanoparticles of different sizes ,",
    "the blocking temperature effect is very sensitive to the relative strengths between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange constants . for clarity ,",
    "figure 6 displays the relation between the average magnitude of the energies associated with the parallel spin alignment ( @xmath92 ) and anti - parallel spin alignment ( @xmath93 ) configurations within the particle , @xmath94 in terms of which we define the differential exchange energy @xmath95 .",
    "solid and dashed lines represent fc and zfc processes , respectively , and the arrows indicate their dynamics .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath96 term to the total energy of the nanoparticle is very small , however it is responsible for the deblocking behavior at @xmath79 . at the high temperature regime",
    "the average exchange energy is nonzero , because of a remaining finite short range correlation between nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "most of the energy is due to the ferromagnetic ordering . during the zfc ( dashed line ) the af core overwhelms the ferromagnetic surface and forces the magnetization of the whole nanoparticle to vanish .",
    "then , in the subsequent heating , even a very small applied field is enough to trigger the alignment of the ferromagnetic surface , which is evidenced by the relative increase of the ferromagnetic energy . on the other hand , during the fc process",
    "the applied field is able to magnetize the nanoparticle at higher temperatures , before the af correlations of the core become too strong .",
    "thus , the interplay between af and f exchange energies gives rise to the hysteresis in temperature that we observe in the fc - zfc calculations .",
    "we have developed a new approach to calculate the classical magnetic properties of single - domain nanoparticles . treating the nearest neighbor pair correlation functions explicitly we were able to obtain a simple set of equations for the magnetization at any point in the particle .",
    "in addition , eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) can also account for the inclusion of interactions between next nearest neighbors in a straightforward manner , by incorporating the corresponding @xmath4 into the operators ( [ op1 ] ) and ( [ op2 ] ) and increasing the coordination number @xmath97 of each spin . the method can be applied to different lattice geometries and extended to 3d systems .",
    "the formalism treats correctly the short - range correlations that arise in heterogeneous nanoparticles , which have regions of different magnetic properties , e.g. , oxidized ferromagnetic particles .",
    "such spin correlations were evidenced by the observation of the exchange shift in hysteresis loops and by the blocking - deblocking effect in the fc - zfc calculations .",
