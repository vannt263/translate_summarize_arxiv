    "so the accretion luminosity is 10@xmath81 - 10@xmath22 times higher than the measured bolometric luminosity and efficiency of conversion of available energy in radiation must be lower than 10@xmath90 .",
    "the final efficiency depends actually on how the matter , once captured at r@xmath85 is accreted , how reaches the bh event horizon , which are the characteristics of the flow and whether a disk forms . cocker and melia ( 1997 ) in their simulations also found that the accreted specific angular momentum l in units of cr@xmath50 ( @xmath46 = l / cr@xmath50 ) varies around an average of @xmath46 = 40  @xmath91  10 with the sign swapping on time - scales of @xmath75  100 years .",
    "this implies that the circularization radius r@xmath92 ( distance at which angular momentum equals the keplerian value ) is @xmath47  3000  r@xmath50 and a large accretion disk probably does not form .",
    "an optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disk has efficiency of the order of 0.1 and , if present around sgr  a@xmath2 , would originate a bright spectral peak in the uv band similar to the blue bump of agns , followed by a steep wien tail which may contribute little to x - rays",
    ". the low energy tail would extend to nir and such component would violate the menten et al .",
    "( 1997 ) upper limits .",
    "+ the first attempt to fit the entire spectrum of sgr  a@xmath2 modeling the accretion into the massive bh was done by melia ( 1992 , 1994 ) , who computed emission produced in pure spherical bondi - hoyle geometry . without the viscous dissipation which occurs in disks , matter would fall into the hole heated up by simple adiabatic compression , and efficiency of conversion of gravitational energy in radiation would be very small",
    ". however it is usually assumed that matter carries , in the fall , the magnetic field , maintained in equipartition with the gas , and magnetic dissipation by turbulence or field lines reconnection can heat efficiently the particles which then emit synchrotron , free - free and inverse compton radiation . with this model melia ( 1992 )",
    "could fit the available data for a black hole mass of 10@xmath0  m@xmath1 , a value smaller than recent estimates . in its 1994 model ,",
    "melia also included an optically thick disk at small radii , to account for the effects of the accreted angular momentum , but the menten et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ir upper limits are not compatible even with such small disk .",
    "recently , cocker and melia ( 2000 ) revisited the model improving computation of the emitted spectrum and assuming magnetic field b in sub - equipartition by letting its value to be free parameter .",
    "considering variability the model luminosities seem marginally compatible with the data and imply that b , which is of few mg at r@xmath85 ( @xmath75 10@xmath14  r@xmath50 ) , does not reach the equipartition value at intermediate radii . only in the inner region of @xmath5  5 - 25",
    "r@xmath50 , where gas circularizes and a small keplerian disk is formed , the magnetic dynamo can rise the field to values of the order of 200 g. the emission from this inner region could then account for the sub - mm excess and for its polarization .",
    "however this variant of the model fits the data only for an effective accretion rate @xmath47  10@xmath74  @xmath86 . + in 1995",
    ", narayan et al .",
    "proposed that accretion flows for sub - eddington rates ( @xmath93 ) in systems with bhs be dominated by advection .",
    "these models ( adaf ) assume a very weak coupling between protons and electrons in the flow and the energy carried by protons is not transmitted efficiently to the radiating electrons but rather advected into the hole .",
    "+ the plasma gets very hot ( optically thin ) , flows with 2 temperatures ( kt@xmath94  10@xmath95  k , kt@xmath96  10@xmath26  k ) , with nearly spherical geometry ( geometrically thick disks ) , but with viscous dissipation and momentum transport .",
    "the radio spectrum is generated by optically thick self - absorbed synchrotron emission from hot nearly - relativistic thermal electrons at different temperatures .",
    "each disk ring at radius r gives rise to a spectrum peaked at the critical frequency above which radiation becomes optically thin . a total flat spectrum is then produced by the superposition of these ring spectra .",
    "highest radio frequencies are generated by the hottest electrons of the inner regions close to the bh while inverse compton produces a weak tail in ir , optical and uv , and x - rays are produced by thin thermal bremsstrahlung from electrons at all radii till r@xmath85 .",
    "the best adaf model for sgr  a@xmath2 @xcite fits the radio data , the rosat x - ray flux and the ir and hard x - rays upper limits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ibissen ] ) for the correct bh mass but for an accretion rate @xmath97 10@xmath55  m@xmath1 yr@xmath19 .",
    "this is more than a factor 10 lower than estimated from the irs  16 stellar winds .",
    "since in adaf l  @xmath98  @xmath99 the luminosity for 10 times the rate would be 100 times greater and the discrepancy is not easily explained @xcite . to account for the egret @xmath3-ray source narayan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) computed the contribution of decay of pions produced by proton - proton collisions in the very hot inner region of the adaf .",
    "the spectrum could reproduce the egret spectral shape but not the flux normalization . on the other hands electrons produced by the muons seem able to naturally account for the _ cm _ part of the spectrum not well explained by the thermal electrons @xcite .",
    "+ the spectrum of narayan et al .",
    "1998 fitted the rosat flux and the new value of x - ray luminosity obtained with chandra certainly makes more acute the problem of accretion rate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ibissen ] ) .",
    "blandford @xmath27 begelman ( 1999 ) argued that adafs must have outflows in form of winds and , more recently , it was also found that convection in the disk may reduce outward transport of angular momentum reducing the net flow of matter into the hole @xcite .",
    "both these new variants of adaf ( known as adios and cdaf ) could reduce effective mass accretion .",
    "however quataert @xmath27 narayan ( 1999 ) discussed the spectral shape of adaf with winds and found that since soft x - rays are produce far from the hole ( between 10@xmath13 - 10@xmath14  r@xmath50 ) , outflows , expected in the inner regions , will not reduce the expected x - ray emission and discrepancy with the accretion rates is not resolved . moreover",
    "the chandra steep spectrum does not seem compatible with thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "another important difficulty for adaf models is the recent discovery of linear polarization in the sub - mm band . in both adaf and bondi - hoyle models",
    "this excess is produced in the inner regions of the flow and therefore even if radiation can be initially polarized , the accreting plasma encountered on the way out would depolarize the emission by faraday effect @xcite , unless very peculiar geometries are invoked . observed",
    "values of polarization seem to imply accretion rates as low as 10@xmath100  m@xmath1  yr@xmath19 making of course need for low - efficiency models much less important .",
    "+ all these factors certainly revive the non - thermal models of sgr  a@xmath2 .",
    "the flat ( index @xmath5 0.3 ) radio spectrum could indeed be interpreted as due to thin synchrotron radiation from a quasi mono - energetic distribution of electrons , e.g. accelerated by shocks inside the accretion flow .",
    "the low frequency cut - off is due to self absorption while the high frequency one to the cut off in the truncated power - law electron distribution .",
    "such model was investigate by beckert et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and refined by beckert @xmath27 duschl ( 1997 ) .",
    "x - rays can then be produced by self synchrotron compton ( ssc ) emission .",
    "the main difficulty was to correctly account for the x - ray flux and to explain the `` ad - hoc '' cut off in the electron distribution .",
    "another non - thermal model for sgr  a@xmath2 is the jet / nozzle model , recently re - discussed by falcke @xmath27 markoff ( 2000 ) ( see references therein ) .",
    "the authors propose that radio emission is generated in a compact radio jet , similar to those seen in agns , but less powerful .",
    "this model could explain the possible asymmetry in the radio and sub - mm shape of the source @xcite which , if confirmed , would indeed favor the presence of a jet .",
    "the base of the jet where the acceleration of the magnetized plasma takes place , the nozzle , is a compact region where the sub - mm radiation is originated .",
    "the nozzle is close to the bh and to the inner part of the accretion flow .",
    "the jet mechanism is not known but the authors invoke a coupling between jet and accretion disk . as for the mono - energetic electron model",
    "the x - rays are produced by ssc and the expected spectrum seems to fit well the recent chandra results .",
    "however the accretion flow must not provide relevant x - ray emission and the problems of low - efficiency accretion or of a much lower effective accretion rate than the one estimated from data on stellar winds remain .",
    "+ finally , the sgr  b2 6.4 kev line could indicate that sgr  a@xmath2 is flaring , may be cyclically like the x - ray novae .",
    "however if the accreted material is stored between the flares , in a large low - viscosity disk , the latter should be visible in ir .",
    "adafs have become popular in recent yeas because they seemed able to explain , in the frame of bh accretion disk thermal models , the low efficiencies observed in the nucleus of our galaxy and of other close normal galaxies",
    ". however these models are now encountering serious difficulties , and non - thermal models become again competitive .",
    "all models however fail to explain why the closest known massive black hole to us radiates so little , unless we admit that it does not accrete the available matter as expected .",
    "major advances in understanding of the physics of the galactic center will be provided in the next years by new and more accurate observations , in particular at high energies .",
    "the chandra and xmm - newton observatories will probably address the question of the x - ray ( 0.1 - 15 kev ) luminosity , variability and spectrum of sgr  a@xmath2 and of the characteristics and origin of the local x - ray diffuse emission .",
    "the next esa @xmath3-ray ( 3 kev - 10 mev ) mission integral will allow to study , if present , the adaf hard x - ray component predicted by narayan et al .",
    "[ fig : ibissen ] reports the expected sensitivity of the medium energy ( 20 kev - 10 mev ) instrument ( ibis ) onboard integral compared with the adaf model .",
    "detailed simulations @xcite show that ibis will be able to detect the expected thermal bremsstrahlung hard component of sgr  a@xmath2 in 4  10@xmath0  s. with integral it will be possible to search for a compact source of 511 kev line at the gc . in spite",
    "most models do not predict a strong e@xmath71-e@xmath70 annihilation line contribution from the mbh itself , fatuzzo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argued that part of the 511 kev bulge component may be due to cumulative effect of pair production in the expanding shells of repeated sgr  a  east type events .",
    "high energy observations with glast at @xmath9 100 mev will resolve the standing problem of the egret source , possibly linked to the sgr  a@xmath2 or to the non - thermal sgr  a east shell .",
    "the latter is also expected to provide detectable flux in the tev range , making the gc an interesting target also for next generation of ground vhe / uhe @xmath3-ray and neutrino experiments .",
    "moreover the galactic center has been recognized as possible site of large cold dark matter concentration and annihilation .",
    "+ sgr  a@xmath2 is probably the closest massive black hole , and in spite presently in low state of activity , remains a highly privileged target for astronomical multi-@xmath46 observations and for future astroparticle experiments .",
