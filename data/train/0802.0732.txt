    "figure [ fig:8x ] compares the avrami exponents @xmath91 calculated when @xmath75 with those calculated when @xmath130 ( without cutoff ) .",
    "the avrami exponent @xmath91 becomes much larger than ideal value @xmath0 when @xmath130 as expected .",
    "however , since we can still deduce not only the avrami exponent @xmath91 but the incubation time @xmath20 and the growth time @xmath30 , the kjma picture of phase transformation represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.9 ] ) is still qualitatively valid even when @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , qualitative picture of nucleation and growth will be still valid even if we do not introduce cutoff @xmath73 .",
    "so far , such a thermal fluctuation is expected to initiate nucleation of patter formation in phase field model  @xcite or cell dynamics  @xcite , and is uncritically used without any special care such as our cutoff in this paper .",
    "our phase field simulation for the most basic process of nucleation and growth clearly showed that such a naive expectation is only qualitatively valid and may not lead to quantitatively correct description of the dynamics of phase transformation .",
    "in this report , we used the cell dynamics method  @xcite to study the whole dynamics of phase transformation from the homogeneous nucleation to growth in a simple phase field model .",
    "we found that the kolmogorov - johnson - mehl - avrami ( kjma ) scenario of nucleation and growth is correct in this phase - field model .",
    "specifically , the evolution of the volume fraction of transformed volume follows the kjma formula . by fitting the kjma formula to the simulation data",
    ", we could deduce not only the avrami exponent @xmath91 but the incubation time @xmath20 and the growth time @xmath30 .",
    "so far as the present author knows , there has been virtually no detailed quantitative study of the incubation time .",
    "therefore our report is probably the first quantitative report of the theoretical study of the incubation time @xmath20 .",
    "the avrami exponent @xmath91 is found to be very close to the ideal value @xmath0 .",
    "the incubation time @xmath20 is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature and is qualitatively in accord with the theory of shneidman - weinberg  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion would be valid for real materials unless some activation - type temperature dependence comes in through , for example , diffusion - limited growth .",
    "in fact , many experimental workers  @xcite successfully analyzed their experimental data assuming exponential activation - type temperature dependence of incubation time without paying much attention to the shneidman - weinberg theory .",
    "however , this could partly due to the ambiguity of the definition of experimentally determined incubation time that could be actually the growth time . in our study",
    "we have separated the incubation time and growth time unambiguously using the kjma formula for the volume fraction .",
    "it turns out that both the incubation time and the growth time are the same order of magnitude in the phase - field model .",
    "therefore , similar clear discrimination between the incubation time and the growth time , if possible , would be necessary to analyze experimental data quantitatively .",
    "the temperature dependence of nucleation rate @xmath133 deduced from the growth time @xmath30 follows the classical nucleation theory except at low undercooling .",
    "the error at the low undercooling is caused from the difficulty of controlling nucleation event in phase field model .",
    "an ad hoc cutoff @xmath73 to prevent thermal fluctuation and extra nucleation in the region where the phase transformation has already started can not work well for the low undercooling .",
    "therefore , a blind use of thermal fluctuation in phase field model and/or cell dynamics method needs caution . it may not give a quantitatively correct dynamics of phase transformation .",
    "our numerical simulation has unambiguously shown that an inappropriate choice of this cutoff parameter will lead to quantitatively incorrect avrami exponent @xmath91 .    in conclusion , we have shown that the most basic dynamics of phase transformation in the phase field model follows the scenario of kolmogorov - johanson - mehl - avrami .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that the incubation time @xmath20 and the growth time @xmath30 show different temperature dependence .",
    "therefore , the total phase transformation time @xmath122 will not be described by a simple single formula .",
    "if , however , @xmath30 is dominant , that is expected when the temperature is lowered , the temperature dependence of phase transformation time follows usual activation - type formula of cnt . on the other hand , if @xmath20 is dominant , the phase transformation time is not activation - type but is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature  @xcite .    finally , in contrast to the standard cellular automaton  @xcite and the lattice model  @xcite where artificial evolution processes are introduced algorithmically , the evolution in the phase - field model is driven by the free energy and the thermal noise , and is completely free from artificial parameters .",
    "therefore , the phase - field model with cell dynamics method is powerful method to study the various phase transformation scenarios , in particular , of the time evolution including the incubation time and the growth time without introducing many unknown and uncontrollable parameters .",
    "for example , various scenarios of heterogeneous nucleation are already clarified  @xcite by this phase - field model with cell dynamics method .",
