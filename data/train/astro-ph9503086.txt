    "astrophysicists have had a long - standing interest in the physics of elementary processes in super - strong magnetic fields , with field strengths @xmath0  g. the cyclotron lines observed in the spectra of her x-1 @xcite and of 4u 0115 + 63 @xcite as well as in many other x - ray pulsars have energy centers which correspond to field intensities in this range .",
    "there is also evidence for such field strengths in the spin - down rates of radio pulsars .",
    "if the spin - down is attributed to energy loss to electromagnetic radiation from a spinning magnetic dipole , many observations are consistent with field strengths of the order of @xmath1-@xmath2  g , with some pulsar field strengths well in excess of even @xmath2  g @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is tantalizing evidence for cyclotron lines in the spectra of gamma - ray bursts seen by the gamma - ray burst detector aboard the ginga satellite @xcite , with line center energies consistent with field intensities of order @xmath1  g.    the association of soft gamma repeaters with supernova remnants provides indirect evidence for even stronger fields . if the 8  s periodicity of the march 5 1979 event is identified with the rotation period of the neutron star , the known age of the n49 remnant may be used to estimate that the field strength is approximately @xmath3  g @xcite .",
    "moreover , such a strong field could help resolve the puzzle of how the march 5 1979 event could ostensibly have been so extravagantly in excess of the eddington limit ( @xmath4 ) , by suppressing the thomson cross - section for photons propagating nearly parallel to the field lines @xcite .    in fields such as these , comparable in strength to the critical field strength @xmath5  g ,",
    "all calculations of elementary processes must be carried out using quantum electrodynamics .",
    "there have been many such calculations over the past two decades , covering topics such as cyclotron absorption @xcite , cyclotron decay @xcite , single photon pair production @xcite , pair annihilation to a single photon @xcite , compton scattering @xcite , two photon pair production @xcite , two photon pair annihilation @xcite , @xmath6 scattering @xcite , and several more .",
    "all these processes have very different behavior from their @xmath7 counterparts ( if those counterparts are even possible ) , on account of the peculiar kinematics , as well as the discrete electronic states ( landau levels ) associated with a uniform external magnetic field .",
    "these calculations have always been carried out in the furry picture , in close analogy to the @xmath7 feynman rules .",
    "the free space electron propagator is replaced by a propagator which is a green s function for the dirac equation in the external field , and the external fermion lines are represented by solutions of that equation .",
    "the results have often been interesting and useful , but they have not been uniformly satisfactory . the leading order calculation of resonant compton scattering yields results which are divergent at the cyclotron resonances @xcite , evidently because to this order the theory makes no provision for natural line width .",
    "the line width may be included `` by hand '' in the results , making the cyclotron resonances finite @xcite . however , there are other such `` resonant divergences '' in compton scattering , which have nothing to do with the cyclotron resonances and which are not nearly as tractable @xcite .",
    "in fact , one such resonance , which occurs exactly at the threshold where the initial photon may pair - produce , is responsible for making the total compton cross - section divergent _ everywhere _ above this threshold .    in fact , the theory of elementary processes in external magnetic fields is plagued with such divergences . with a little practice",
    ", it is not hard to discover divergences resembling these _ in every single process of second or higher order_. clearly , this is a troublesome development that casts a shadow upon the entire undertaking .",
    "these resonant divergences occur because the kinematics of these processes allow intermediate `` virtual states '' to be real  that is , on - shell .",
    "often , the on - shell intermediate state is an excited state , such as an electron in an excited landau level , or a photon above the one photon pair - production threshold . in this case",
    "there is an associated decay width that may be pressed into service to control the divergence .",
    "the weisskopf - wigner broadening prescription , @xmath8 when applied to the energy denominators in the propagator , pushes the poles in the propagator off the real axis , so that while the intermediate states may still be on - shell the propagator no longer diverges there .",
    "this is in fact the approach that has been adopted for compton scattering @xcite , and which ascribes the natural line width to the cyclotron resonances .    however , there are circumstances in which a _ stable _ on - shell intermediate state may be produced .",
    "such states are not attended by a decay width , so the associated divergence may not be reined in as before .",
    "it should be pointed out that these divergences are entirely unrelated to the notorious ultraviolet divergences of qed .",
    "they are not the consequence of improper manipulation of field - theoretic distributions ; rather , they occur whenever the circumstances of the elementary process permit a kinematically accessible on - shell intermediate state ( kaosis ) .",
    "it is easy to recognize when a kaosis is permitted .",
    "for example , a second - order process will allow one if it may be viewed as a succession of two real first - order processes .",
    "thus the kaosis corresponding to cyclotron resonance occurs because the process may be viewed as a real cyclotron absorption followed by a real cyclotron emission .",
    "similarly , the second `` disastrous '' resonance in compton scattering is due to a kaosis that corresponds to the initial photon undergoing a real decay to a pair , followed by the resulting positron annihilating with the initial electron to produce the final photon .",
    "the reason this kaosis is catastrophic is that the intermediate positron may be in the landau ground state , so that no decay width is available to restrain the divergence .    at the same time",
    ", there is a second defect of the theory which so far has not received recognition as a problem . the calculation of s - matrix elements as outlined above always results in a @xmath9-function which enforces strict energy conservation between initial and final states .",
    "this remains true even if some of these scattering states are unstable .",
    "but this is not physically sensible ; the energy of an unstable state is only known to within its decay width , so that it is ludicrous to demand strict energy conservation for such transitions",
    ". nevertheless , the current theory does so irrespective of whether or not the states are stable . as an example , the calculation of the decay of an electron in an excited landau state produces the result that the emitted cyclotron photon is monochromatic , rather than having the lorentzian line shape characteristic of resonant decay @xcite .",
    "the difficulties of resonant divergence and of spurious energy conservation are related .",
    "briefly , a stable kaosis may only occur if some of the particles in the initial and final states are themselves unstable , and it is their decay widths that restrain the divergence . however , the introduction of these decay widths smears out their energy , so that energy conservation ( which was a consequence of their assumed eternal duration ) no longer obtains .",
    "thus it appears that we must modify the current theory somehow if we are to circumvent these unphysical features . that modification is the purpose of this work .",
    "we demonstrate below that radiative corrections modify the propagators and the scattering states by introducing their respective decay widths into the s - matrix elements . in this sense",
    ", we are extending the results of graziani @xcite , who carried out this program for the electron propagator only .",

    "we begin with a discussion of the role that the bare electron and photon propagators have in producing the resonant divergences . in this section and throughout the rest of this work we use the metric signature",
    "@xmath10 $ ] .",
    "the bare electron propagator is simply expressed in terms of the fermion one - particle states .",
    "we work in the furry picture , so these states are represented by solutions @xmath11 of the landau - dirac ( l - d ) equation , that is , the dirac equation in the presence of a classical , uniform , external magnetic field : @xmath12\\psi^{(\\eta)}_a=0.\\label{ldeqn}\\ ] ] here , @xmath13 refers to whether the solution has positive or negative energy , while @xmath14 is the set of quantum numbers that specify the state  landau level number , @xmath15-momentum , spin , and an orbit center coordinate .",
    "we choose the gauge @xmath16 , @xmath17 for the external magnetic field , which is directed in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "we also choose the orbit center coordinate @xmath19 to be the @xmath20 cartesian coordinate of the orbit center . with these choices , the functional dependence of the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ ldeqn ] ) is that of a plane wave in the @xmath21 and @xmath15 coordinates , while the @xmath20 dependence is that of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator eigenfunction centered about @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to separate out the time dependence of @xmath11 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an eigenstate of the landau - dirac hamiltonian with quantum numbers @xmath14 and eigenvalue @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath25 is given by @xmath26^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath27 is the landau level number , @xmath28 is the momentum in the @xmath15 direction , and @xmath29 is the larmor frequency .",
    "the bare electron propagator @xmath30 may be represented in terms of the @xmath31 : @xmath32 it is easy to verify that the expression in eq .",
    "( [ beprop ] ) is a green s functions for eq .",
    "( [ ldeqn ] ) with the required boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we write @xmath30 rather than @xmath33 because neither eq .",
    "( [ ldeqn ] ) nor its green s functions are translationally invariant  they are invariant under combinations of translations and gauge transformations .",
    "the bare electron propagator enters the leading order calculation of such processes as compton scattering , pair annihilation to two photons , and two photon pair production .",
    "the s - matrix elements for these processes are obtained by sandwiching @xmath30 between appropriate fermion and photon states and integrating over @xmath34 and @xmath35 . these processes",
    "all exhibit resonant divergences .",
    "the proximate cause of those divergences is evidently the energy denominator in eq .",
    "( [ beprop ] ) .",
    "the convolution of the propagator with the initial and final states fixes the values of @xmath36 and @xmath28 at the total energy and @xmath15-momentum of the states , respectively .",
    "thus , the residual energy - related degree of freedom in the summation over intermediate states is the landau level number @xmath27 , a non - negative integer .",
    "it follows that the energy denominator in eq .",
    "( [ beprop ] ) may be zero if the energy and @xmath15-momentum of the scattering states are suitably tuned to one of the landau levels .",
    "if this happens a resonant divergence occurs .",
    "the bare photon propagator has the usual `` transverse '' expression @xmath37 it enters the calculation of s - matrix elements for processes such as electron - electron scattering @xcite and electron - positron scattering .",
    "these processes have total cross - sections which exhibit resonant divergences",
    ". this may seem surprising at first , since the s - matrix elements for these processes are entirely finite , even when a kaosis is present .",
    "there is a key difference between the photon and electron propagators : in the electron case the on - shell energy contains a dependence on the landau level quantum number , a discrete degree of freedom .",
    "thus the resonances are `` spaced - out '' and well - separated . on the other hand ,",
    "the photon on - shell energy is entirely dependent on the purely continuous degrees of freedom @xmath38 , and the `` sum over intermediate states '' is really an integral .",
    "while this integral will undoubtedly encounter any kaosis singularity , the small imaginary part in the denominator of the propagator provides a perfectly straightforward prescription for circumventing the pole .",
    "thus the s - matrix elements are finite for these processes .",
    "nevertheless , whenever an on - shell intermediate state is kinematically accessible , the total cross - sections diverge .",
    "what is going on ?",
    "the divergence is evident in the expressions in appendix c of langer @xcite for the e - e scattering cross - section .",
    "langer performed the integrals over the intermediate states simultaneously with those over final states and the average over initial states , in order to take advantage of several simplifications that ensue .",
    "unfortunately , these manipulations obscure the source of the divergences . in order to shed some light on the situation",
    ", we have calculated cross - sections for e - e and e@xmath39-e@xmath40 scattering by computing the s - matrix elements before summing over final and averaging over initial states .",
    "what we have found can be best illustrated by considering the specific example of e@xmath39-e@xmath40 scattering . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ e+e- ] , there are two relevant feynman diagrams .",
    "we have confirmed that in each case the s - matrix elements are finite even when there is a kaosis .",
    "when a kaosis exists , however , there is a divergence resulting from the sum over _ final _ states . in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ e+e-](a ) , the divergence arises from the integral over the variable @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the orbit center @xmath20-coordinates of the final positron and electron , respectively . in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ e+e-](b ) , the divergence is due to the integral over the variable @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the orbit center @xmath20-coordinate of the initial electron .",
    "we see , then , that the divergence manifests itself as an infinite range of interaction .",
    "when a kaosis is present , the intermediate photon may travel an arbitrarily large distance between its emission and its absorption without a reduction in amplitude .",
    "consequently there is no spatial cutoff in the interaction , and the resulting integral over orbit center separation diverges .",
    "the situation may be further clarified by explicitly computing the interaction range in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "when we calculate an s - matrix element for these processes , we integrate the bare photon propagator @xmath46 multiplied by two fermion currents , one for each vertex . since our states are chosen to be plane waves in the @xmath21-@xmath15 direction , the currents are also plane waves in @xmath21 and @xmath15 , and the integrals over @xmath47 , @xmath21 , and @xmath15 are tantamount to fourier transforms of the photon propagator in those coordinates .",
    "the remaining integral over @xmath20 folds together two ( in general well - separated ) current functions @xmath48",
    ", @xmath49 with the transformed propagator @xmath50 .",
    "we may easily compute @xmath51 .",
    "if we define @xmath52 , with @xmath53 , we find @xmath54 thus , if @xmath55 ( the condition for the existence of a kaosis ) , the effective interaction range is infinite , whereas it is of finite range @xmath56 otherwise .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of coulomb scattering .",
    "if a wave packet scatters with large impact parameter from the center of the coulomb potential , the momentum transfer is very low , and thus the exchanged photon is very close to its mass - shell ( that is , its @xmath57 vector is very near the apex of the light cone ) .",
    "this is the reason that the total coulomb cross - section is divergent  the extreme infrared photons , which are nearly on - shell , give the interaction an infinite range .",
    "there is one noteworthy difference here , however : for the processes we consider , the virtual photons do not need to be infinitely soft to be on - shell , so that these resonant divergences are in no sense infra - red divergences .    as a consequence of this analysis",
    ", the cure for photon - propagator - related resonant divergences will necessarily have a slightly different mathematical character from that for the divergences that arise in connection with the electron propagator .",
    "while in the latter case we need to show how the previously diverging amplitudes may be made to converge , in the former case we must show how the previously long - range `` effective interaction '' may have its range curtailed .",
    "the necessity of complexifying the energy denominator of the electron propagator so as to obtain the weisskopf - wigner line shape has been recognized for some time @xcite , although these authors lacked a formal justification for their _ ad hoc _ complexification of the energy , given in eq .",
    "( [ ecmplx ] ) .",
    "graziani@xcite provided this justification by considering radiative corrections to the electron propagator . as it turns out ,",
    "the same procedure may be applied to the photon propagator as well .",
    "quite generally , one finds that the operator which represents the self - interaction ( the mass operator @xmath58 in the case of the electron , the polarization operator @xmath59 in the case of the photon ) singles out those solutions of the wave equation in which it is diagonal .",
    "the dressed propagator may then be expressed as a sum over all such states , with the energy in the denominator acquiring an imaginary part given by eq .",
    "( [ ecmplx ] ) .",
    "we review the discussion of the electron propagator from ref .",
    "@xcite , and extend it to the photon propagator in the next section .",
    "the dressed propagator @xmath60 is related to the bare propagator and the self - energy operator @xmath61 by the dyson equation @xmath62 , where the dot denotes four - dimensional convolution as well as spinorial matrix multiplication .",

    "it may be shown @xcite that @xmath65 diagonalizes @xmath58 if the @xmath31 are simultaneous eigenstates of the landau - dirac hamiltonian and of the @xmath15-component of the magnetic moment operator of sokolov and ternov @xcite .",
    "this condition defines what is meant by `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' , in the absence of the tools provided by poincar group representation theory ( the physical system no longer has full poincar invariance ) .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , _ and only in this case _ , @xmath66 may be represented in a form analogous to eq .",

    "it is in general a complex number , in contradistinction to the case where the external field strength is zero , where the diagonal matrix elements of the self - energy operator are real .",
    "the real part of @xmath68 merely yields a small shift in the energy of the state , while the imaginary part provides a line - width to the otherwise divergent resonant energy denominator .",
    "this justifies neglecting the real shift while preserving the imaginary width .",
    "it was shown explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite that in this approximation , the pole in the propagator corresponding to state @xmath14 , @xmath70 is located at @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is just the weisskopf - wigner decay rate of the state @xmath14 , computed to leading order : @xmath73 here , @xmath74 is the interaction matrix element for the transition from the state @xmath14 to the state @xmath75 with the emission of a photon with wave vector * k * and polarization .",

    "it turns out that in every second - order process with a stable kaosis there are non - zero decay rates associated with the initial and final scattering states .",
    "thus , in the first of the two examples above , the initial and final photons are capable of decay , while in the second example , there are excited landau levels in both the initial and final states .",
    "one might hope , then , that the decay rates of the scattering states might be pressed into service to control the resonant divergences when the decay rate of the intermediate state is zero . as we now demonstrate , this is not only possible , it is a necessary feature of the same program of radiative corrections that brought the decay rates into the propagators .",
    "that program demands that we should apply radiative corrections to the external lines , in addition to the propagators .",
    "it might be objected at this point that loop corrections to external lines can have no bearing on the problem , since the arbitrary constants which arise during renormalization are in part fixed by the requirement that the external lines should suffer no corrections , so that the scattering states should continue to be represented by solutions of the `` free '' wave equation with the physical mass @xcite .",
    "the answer to this objection is that in the present case , the limited number of arbitrary constants is not sufficient to satisfy the physical requirement above for all scattering states .",
    "for example , in the case of the electron field , we may _ only _ demand that the landau ground state @xmath133 propagate according to eq .",

    "the origin of this `` feature '' of magnetic qed is the fact that excited scattering states are technically not scattering states at all , insofar as they do not correspond to asymptotic one - particle states of the quantum field which are stable . in principle",
    ", we should only use stable states as initial and final scattering states  electrons and positrons in the landau ground state and photons below the one photon pair - production threshold .",
    "the consequence of this restriction on the theory would be that multiple scattering events and scatterings followed by multiple emissions could only be treated by computing scattering amplitudes corresponding to very high order feynman diagrams , a notoriously burdensome task .",
    "thus , some of the most interesting astrophysical applications of the theory would become virtually inaccessible .    as an alternative",
    ", we may represent such high - order multiple events as a succession of lower order transitions between states that are not necessarily stable , and treating those states as if they were genuine scattering states .",
    "for example , a process in which an electron in the ground state and a photon of energy above the third cyclotron harmonic make a resonant transition to a state with an electron in the ground state and four photons may be approximated by a compton scattering event in which the final electron is left at the third harmonic , followed by three resonant decays .",
    "this approximation of scattering states by excited states is a common one in the literature @xcite , but to date there has been no investigation of its validity and limitations , or of what modifications the usual feynman perturbation theory must suffer in order to accommodate them .",

    "go to infinity in the s - matrix element is tantamount to asking the question , `` what is the probability of observing this decaying state in the infinitely distant future ? '' clearly , no calculation is required to see that the answer must be `` zero . '' similarly , letting the lower time limit go to minus infinity amounts to inquiring about an interaction at a finite time of a decaying state which was prepared in the infinitely distant past  a process which also has vanishing probability of occurrence .",
    "it is therefore necessary that the scattering theory be formulated for states prepared at finite times @xmath158 and measured at finite times @xmath159 .",

    "physically , it is necessary to ensure that the initial states be normalized at the preparation time @xmath158 , and that the final states be normalized at the measurement time @xmath159 .",

    "( [ absecon ] ) , so that in this case we also recover strict energy conservation for stable state to stable state scattering .",
    "the regime of validity of the `` emission '' and `` absorption '' scattering limits is obvious from their context . on the other hand , the general formula in eq .",
    "( [ etfacgen ] ) requires some discussion .",
    "as discussed previously , the formula never `` misbehaves '' , in the sense that it never yields a divergent result .",
    "in fact , in general that result tends to zero as @xmath242 .",
    "while this is physically sensible , it obviously makes the large time - lapse limit a less than useful one .",
    "it is clear that what fails in this limit is the validity of the perturbation - theoretic order of the calculation .",
    "since the scattering states are themselves decaying to other states , those other states should be included in the calculation , leading to higher - order processes .",
    "the second - order calculations outlined in the previous section are only useful for values of @xmath241 such that the scattering states have little chance to decay , that is for @xmath274 , where @xmath208 is the largest of the decay rates in the process . for example",
    ", we might choose @xmath241 to be on the order of a collision time , if we are studying a gas with density and temperature such that the collision rates far exceed the decay rates .",
    "the general case above obviously represents a fairly radical departure from the usual scattering formulae .",
    "the `` emission '' and `` absorption '' scattering limits amount to somewhat less radical modifications .",
    "one obvious such modification is the replacement of strict energy conservation with `` lorentzian '' energy conservation .",
    "another is that the `` non - resonant '' energy denominators [ eqs .  ( [ absetfdmn ] ) , ( [ absetfcpl ] ) , ( [ absetfcmn ] ) , ( [ emetfdmn ] ) , ( [ emetfcpl ] ) , ( [ emetfcmn ] ) ] now contain the decay rates of the scattering states as well as those of the intermediate states .",
    "the importance of these changes depends upon whether the decay widths entering the energy denominators are electron decay widths or photon decay widths .",
    "if the decay widths are purely fermionic , they are gently varying functions of energy , and their magnitudes are smaller by @xmath77 than their own characteristic scale of variation , the scale of variation of the interaction matrix elements , and the characteristic separation of the resonances .",
    "consequently , in this case the relative change that results from introducing lorentzian , rather than exact , energy conservation , and from introducing the decay widths of the scattering states into the energy denominators , is of order @xmath77 . on the other hand ,",
    "if some of the decay widths correspond to photon lines , they can vary rather rapidly as a function of energy @xcite .",
    "thus , the behavior of the energy denominators is not really `` lorentzian '' , despite notational appearances to the contrary .",
    "the departure from the cross - sections computed assuming strict energy conservation and not including external line decay widths might turn out to be appreciable in this case , although its precise magnitude remains to be assessed .    in the limit of stable scattering states the usual results",
    "are completely reproduced , since we recover strict energy conservation and there are no scattering state decay widths to include in resonant energy denominators .    in connection with the dressed photon propagator of eq .",
    "( [ dppropa ] ) , we wish to comment on a point which is a potential source of confusion .",
    "the decay width @xmath121 is to be evaluated on the light cone , as implied by the first line of eq .",
    "( [ gammaphot ] ) .",
    "now , when the photon propagator is used in an s - matrix element , the values of @xmath275 , @xmath276 , and @xmath277 are fixed by the @xmath47 , @xmath21 , and @xmath15 momenta of the scattering states .",
    "thus , the sum over intermediate photon wave states involves an integral over the component @xmath278 of the wave vector @xmath113 .",
    "the value of @xmath121 must be evaluated for _ each _ value of @xmath278 in the integral .",
    "this is analogous to the case of the electron propagator , eq .",
    "( [ depropa ] ) , in which the intermediate electron decay width is evaluated , on the energy shell , for each landau level in the sum over intermediate states .",
    "the only difference between the two cases is that the relevant degrees of freedom are discrete for the electron propagator , while they are continuous for the photon propagator .",
    "the radiatively corrected photon propagator permits for the first time the evaluation of processes such as @xmath279 , @xmath280 , and @xmath281 , all of which are important for neutron star emission . of equal astrophysical importance",
    "is the evaluation above the one photon pair - production threshold of compton scattering , two photon pair annihilation , and two photon pair production , which is now possible by virtue of the radiatively corrected scattering states .",
    "finally , we now have access to the processes @xmath282 and @xmath279 even when the initial and final states are excited .",
    "while this work was performed , carlo graziani held a national research council - nasa goddard space flight center research associateship .",
