    "<S> the effective hamiltonian is designed to generate , up to second order in perturbation theory , the same heisenberg equations of motion for the photonic operators as the full hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we thus determine the equations of motion for the photon operators @xmath33 perturbatively in the photon - electron coupling constant @xmath31 and deduce @xmath32 from them . </S>",
    "<S> we deal with a nonequilibrium problem in steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the external bias voltage that drives the system out of equilibrium leads to time - dependent phases in the effective hamiltonian and we obtain @xmath34 the effective hamiltonian @xmath32 has the form of the hamiltonian of the quantum parametric amplifier in eq .   and describes electronic pumping of photons via coupling to superconducting leads . </S>",
    "<S> it consist of three parts that correspond to different aspects of the junction .    </S>",
    "<S> the first part is the photon energy renormalized by the interaction @xmath35 , which is of no fundamental importance to our analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the second term describes the effect of the device being a source of single photons . </S>",
    "<S> it also occurs in the normal state where it describes radiation of the usual light emitting diode and produces single photons at a constant rate . in the presence of superconducting leads and the macroscopic electronic coherence </S>",
    "<S> , however , this term also contributes to the emergence of two - photon coherence . </S>",
    "<S> the different physical processes that contribute to the coherence are depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the `` coefficients '' @xmath36 contain fermionic creation and annihilation operators . as a consequence of the non - equilibrium state , </S>",
    "<S> these operators depend on the initial values of the fermionic operators well in the past where we assume that the system was decoupled and in local equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> they act as random external ( non - commuting ) fields , which arise from the coupling of the photons to the fermionic bath , and commute with the photon operators @xmath37=0 $ ] but not with their hermitian conjugate @xmath38 \\neq 0 $ ] . at @xmath39 in the superconducting state , they are defined by correlators such as ( for details consult the supplementary material ) @xmath40 they contain the superconducting energy dispersions @xmath41 , the bcs coherence - factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 and we have neglected corrections to the quasi - particle energies by photon momenta @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> most important is the third term , where at @xmath39 holds @xmath45 this term is responsible for the fact that @xmath46 does have the form of a parametric amplifier , producing entangled photon pairs . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is meant in the sense that the emitted photon pairs have opposite momentum and same chirality . </S>",
    "<S> if the coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 were numbers and would not contain fermionic operators of the initial state , we would immediately see that eq .   describes a system that produces squeezed light  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent analysis shows that this is still the case , even with the more complicated form of @xmath46 .     </S>",

    "<S> where @xmath70 , it follows directly from the bosonic commutation relations that ( for details see supplementary material ) @xmath71where @xmath72 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 depends on the superconducting phase difference @xmath74 and can easily be determined from our model . </S>",
    "<S> the key finding is that the expectation value ( see eq .  ) that determines the uncertainties of the quadrature amplitudes of @xmath75 can be changed if one changes the relative phase of the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> if we picture the squeezing as an uncertainty ellipse ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) , changing @xmath13 simply rotates it .    , where @xmath76 denotes the free photon propagator and @xmath77 the photon self - energy due to coupling to electrons . </S>",
    "<S> solid ( dashed ) lines denote conduction ( valence ) electron propagators and wiggly lines denote photon propagators . ]    </S>",
    "<S> next we address the problem of squeezing and photon statistics using a more rigorous approach that allows more easily for a generalization to higher order processes and feedback of the photon system onto the superconducting leads . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we use the schwinger - keldysh formulation  @xcite of the hamiltonian in eq .   and integrate out the fermionic degrees of freedom to arrive at an effective photonic action on the keldysh time - contour given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 carries both the keldysh @xmath80 and the nambu structure . </S>",
    "<S> the photonic propagator @xmath81 acquires self - energy corrections due to the coupling to the superconducting leads @xmath77 as well as a coupling to an external ( markovian ) photon bath @xmath82 , which leads to a finite photon linewidth @xmath83  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider one - loop processes such as those shown in fig .  [ fig:2](a , </S>",
    "<S> b ) . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the electronic coherence of the cooper pairs is transferred to the photons via the anomalous elements of the photon self - energy [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](b ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we first focus on the zero temperature limit in both the leads and the photonic system , and calculate the resulting photonic coherence between modes of opposite momenta by inverting the dyson equation   up to second order in the electron - photon coupling @xmath31 to find @xmath84 here , @xmath85 is the photon frequency measured relative to the applied potential difference and the location of one of the resonances is determined by the bogoliubov dispersion @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the product of bcs coherence factors @xmath87 depends on the relative phase @xmath2 between the two superconductors . using the keldysh approach </S>",
    "<S> , we can thus confirm the above results for the phase dependent quadrature amplitudes and our ability to manipulate light squeezing by coupling to the superconducting phase difference @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the rotating frame of the photon fields the squeezing ellipse rotates with the detuning off the central ( cooper - pair ) peak like @xmath88 $ ] .    while we can perform the momentum sum numerically for the most general parameters , here </S>",
    "<S> we make a simplifying assumption of parabolic band dispersions @xmath89 and @xmath90 with effective masses @xmath91 and band gap @xmath92 . for a symmetric choice @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 defines the ( quasi- ) fermi energies in the two bands related to the applied voltage by @xmath98 , we can evaluate the correlator analytically . the summation over momenta in eq .   in this case </S>",
    "<S> yields @xmath99 } { ( \\nu_{{\\mathbf{q}}}- i \\eta)^2 \\sqrt { 4 </S>",
    "<S> |\\delta|^2 - ( \\nu_{\\bf q } - i \\eta)^2 } } \\nonumber \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 denotes the fermionic density of states at the fermi surface and @xmath101 and @xmath102 are dimensionless frequencies and decay rates .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](b ) , we present the zero temperature expectation value @xmath103 of eq .   for a particular choice of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the function exhibits two peaks , one at frequency @xmath104 and one at @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower frequency peak corresponds to quasi - particle tunneling from the conduction to the valence band , while the peak at @xmath50 is due to tunneling of cooper pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the sum over momenta only broadens the quasi - particle peak . </S>",
    "<S> both processes involve the emission of photons and are thus possible at @xmath39 in the absence of a finite photon density .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also obtained results for the photon coherence in the presence of a finite temperature @xmath105 thermal background of photons . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](c ) a third peak at frequency @xmath106 appears at photon temperature @xmath107 , which corresponds to the absorption of photons from the thermal background and transfer of quasi - particles from the valence to the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> the three processes are schematically depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition we analyze the photon - photon correlation functions by coupling the photons @xmath108 to external counting fields . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the density correlations between the photons of the same momentum @xmath109 obey the thermal relation @xmath110 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations simply reflect the tendency of bosonic particles to bunch . </S>",
    "<S> two photons with the same momentum @xmath111 must have been emitted in uncorrelated events since cooper pairs have total momentum zero .    in the presence of electronic coherence , </S>",
    "<S> however , there also appear density correlations between photons of opposite momenta @xmath112 where @xmath85 and @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations are inherited from the coherence of the cooper pairs within the bcs many - body state . </S>",
    "<S> as before , we observe the asymmetric peak structure at zero temperatures with two peaks occurring at @xmath114 and @xmath50 corresponding to tunneling of quasi - particle and cooper pairs from the conduction to the valence band . </S>",
    "<S> again , at finite ( photon ) temperatures a third peak emerges at @xmath106 due to the correlated absorption of photons from the thermal background imprinting density correlations between @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that a pn - junction in proximity to two bcs superconductors can be operated to emit squeezed light , produces entangled photon pairs and affects the photon density correlations . </S>",
    "<S> squeezing occurs between modes of opposite momenta and results from a transfer of the electronic coherence of the cooper pairs to the photons . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezing angle is controlled by the phase difference between the two superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> this squeezed light emitting diode enables us to use the macroscopic coherence of superconductors to manipulate the photon coherence in a two - photon pump . </S>",
