    "the dissociation of methane on transition metals is an important reaction in catalysis .",
    "it is the rate limiting step in steam reforming to produce syngas.@xcite it is also prototypical for c  h activation in other processes .",
    "a large number of molecular beam experiments in which the dissociation energy was measured as a function of translational energy@xcite as well as various bulb gas experiments@xcite have already been done on this system .",
    "these experiments have contributed much to our understanding of the mechanism of the dissociation . however , our knowledge is still small compared to what we know about a well - studied reaction as @xmath0 dissociation .",
    "some years ago we performed a multi - configurational time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) study of ch@xmath1 dissociation on ni(111)@xcite with a potential energy surface ( pes ) based on our earlier density functional theory ( dft ) calculations.@xcite we included the distance of the methane molecule to the surface , a c  h distance , and the orientation of methane as coordinates .",
    "other wavepacket simulations focused on ( some of ) these coordinates in combination with lattice motion on several metals.@xcite other theoretical studies on this system used dft calculations@xcite too and classical stochastic trajectory simulations.@xcite    none of the wavepacket simulations published so far have looked at the role of the internal vibrations of methane .",
    "it was observed experimentally that vibrationally hot @xmath2 dissociates more readily than cold @xmath2 , with the energy in the internal vibrations being about as effective as the translational energy in inducing dissociation.@xcite however , a more detailed assessment of the importance of the internal vibrations could not be made , because of the large number of internal vibrations .",
    "a recent dft calculation also showed that the transition state for ch@xmath1 dissociation on ni(111 ) involves considerable internal excitation of the molecule.@xcite in this paper we report on wavepacket simulations that we have done to determine which and to what extent internal vibrations are important for the dissociation .",
    "we are not able yet to simulate the dissociation including all internal vibrations .",
    "instead we have simulated the scattering of methane , for which all internal vibrations can be included . by looking at vibrational excitations and the deformation of the molecule when it hits the surface we can derive information that is relevant for the dissociation .",
    "we have used pess that have been developed with ni(111 ) in mind , but our results should hold for other surfaces as well .",
    "we have again used the mctdh method for the wavepacket simulations , because it can deal with a large number of degrees of freedom and with large grids.@xcite this method has been applied successfully to gas phase reactions and reactions at surfaces.@xcite    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a brief description of the mctdh method .",
    "then the various pess that we have used are derived .",
    "( a harmonic intramolecular pes is adapted to include anharmonicities in the c  h distance , the decrease of the c  h bond energy due to interactions with the surface , and the increase of the c  h bond length also due to interactions with the surface . )",
    "the results of the simulations are presented and discussed next .",
    "we focus on excitation probabilities and deformation of the molecule when it hits the surface .",
    "the implications for the dissociation are discussed separately .",
    "we end with a summary and some general conclusions .",
    "we give here a short overview of the mctdh approximation for completeness . more details can be found in refs .   and . the exact wave - function of a @xmath3-dimensional system ,",
    "is approximated by an expression of the form @xmath4 from this expression , it is possible to obtain the equations of motion for the one - dimensional functions @xmath5 and for the correlation coefficients @xmath6 . without loss of generality we can choose the @xmath7 s to be natural single - particle states.@xcite they insure that we obtain the best approximation to the exact @xmath8 for a fixed number of configurations ; i.e.",
    ", they minimize the expression @xmath9 where @xmath10 and where @xmath11 is the exact wave - function .",
    "the natural single - particle functions are eigenstates of the reduced density operators . @xmath12",
    "the equations of motions for the natural single - particle states can be obtained by differentiation of the eigenvalue equation : @xmath13 this gives us @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the hamiltonian @xmath17 given by @xmath18 the equations of motion for the coefficients @xmath19 are again obtained by differentiation .",
    "@xmath20 equations  ( [ eb ] ) and ( [ ec ] ) are a particular form of the more general equations obtained from a time - dependent variational principle.@xcite they conserve the norm of the wave - function and the mean energy of a time - independent hamiltonian .",
    "the resulting system of first - order differential equations , has to be solved with a general - purpose integrator .",
    "we used the variable - order variable - step adams method , as implemented in the nag library.@xcite this method gave good convergence for all described simulations .",
    "for the hardest simulation the method needed 195027 calculations of the time derivatives for 35000 atomic units simulation time , which took around two days cpu - time on an 166 mhz .",

    "the singularities in eqs .",
    "( [ eb ] ) , ( [ ee ] ) , and ( [ ec ] ) have been treated numerically by the regularization procedure described in ref .  .",
    "the natural single - particle states have some small advantages over other possible choices of single - particle states .",
    "the most important one is that one can directly see from @xmath21 how well @xmath22 approximates the exact wave - function .",
    "how much a natural single - particle functions contributes to the wave - function is given by the eigenvalue @xmath23 of the reduced density matrix . in an approximate mctdh simulation @xmath21 is an approximation for this exact eigenvalue .",
    "the natural single - particle functions are also convenient for interpreting the results of a simulations .",

    "we found that the scattering is predominantly elastic . the elastic scattering probability is larger than 0.99 for all orientations and pess at a translational energy of 96 kj / mol , except for the pes with @xmath96 and three hydrogens pointing towards the surface for which it is 0.956 .",
    "this agrees with the observation that the translation - vibration coupling is generally small.@xcite    if we would have wanted to determine the role of the internal vibrations from the scattering probabilities , we would have to do quite accurate simulations .",
    "we have opted instead to look at the molecule when it hits the surface , which enables us to obtain good results with much less costly simulations .",
    "the surface pes has c@xmath41 ( with one or three hydrogens towards the surface ) or c@xmath48 symmetry ( with two hydrogens towards the surface ) .",
    "if we expand this pes in a taylor - series of internal vibrations , we see that the linear terms contain only those vibrations that transform as @xmath40 in c@xmath41 , respectively , c@xmath48 .",
    "these are therefore easier to excite than others ; we did not find any appreciable excitation of @xmath44 modes of c@xmath41 and the @xmath55 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 modes of c@xmath48 .",
    "we will not present results of the simulations with the harmonic pes , because they give almost the same excitation probabilities as the pes with @xmath67 .",
    "the maximum excitation probabilities at the surface for the pes with @xmath67 are given in table [ tab : exprop ] .",
    "we have observed the highest excitations for this pes in the @xmath63 umbrella and @xmath91 bending modes in the orientation with two hydrogens , and for the @xmath63 umbrella mode in the orientation with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface .",

    "we have observed higher excitation probabilities for the @xmath81 and @xmath45 stretch modes in the one hydrogen orientation .",
    "the excitation probability of the @xmath63 umbrella mode is here lower then for the other orientations , but still in the same order as the stretch modes for this orientation .",
    "this can be explained by the values of the @xmath34 s of @xmath26 ( see table [ tab : alpha ] ) and the force constants of @xmath65 ( see table [ tab : gen ] ) , because @xmath65 is approximately @xmath67 for the ground state .",
    "the force constants of @xmath25 for the @xmath81 symmetrical stretch stretch and @xmath45 asymmetrical stretch are of the same order , but the @xmath34 parameter in @xmath97 in the orientation with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface for the @xmath45 asymmetrical stretch is around twice as large as for the @xmath81 symmetrical stretch , which explains why @xmath45 is more excited as @xmath81 .",
    "the surface repulsion on the @xmath63 umbrella mode is even three times lower then on the @xmath81 symmetrical stretch mode , but the force constant is also much lower .",
    "it results in a little more excitation of the @xmath63 umbrella then in the @xmath81 symmetrical stretch .    for the orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the surface the repulsion on the vibrational modes",
    "is for all modes in the same order ( @xmath91 bending a little higher ) , so the difference in excitation probabilities correlate here primarily with the force constants .",
    "the force constants of the @xmath91 bending and @xmath63 umbrella modes are of the same order , as are those of @xmath81 and @xmath45 .",
    "the stretch force constants are higher , however , so that the excitation probabilities are lower .",
    "the repulsion on the @xmath63 umbrella mode is the largest in the orientation with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface .",
    "the force constants is lower for this modes then for the @xmath81 and @xmath45 stretch modes , so the primary excitation is seen in the @xmath63 umbrella mode .    for the orientation with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface the repulsion on the @xmath63 umbrella mode",
    "is the highest in combination with a low force constant , so this mode has a much higher excitation probability than the @xmath81 and @xmath45 stretch modes .",
    "another interesting detail is that the @xmath98 parameter is higher for the orientation with two than with three hydrogens pointing toward the surface , but the excitation probabilities for the @xmath63 umbrella in this orientations are equal .",
    "this is caused by a coupling between the excitation of the @xmath91 bending and the @xmath63 umbrella mode in the orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the surface .",
    "we observed with @xmath99 ( see table [ tab : exprop ] ) that all excitation probabilities become much higher than with @xmath67 , except for the @xmath63 umbrella mode with two hydrogens towards the surface , which stays almost the same .",
    "it is caused by the fact that , although the @xmath81 symmetrical stretch and @xmath45 asymmetrical stretch contribute almost completely to @xmath67 , the @xmath63 umbrella does so just for a small part .",
    "the @xmath63 umbrella contributes primarily , and the @xmath91 bending completely , to the harmonic terms of intramolecular pes @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath99 gives only a lowering in the @xmath100 terms of @xmath25 , so we should expect primarily an higher excitation probability in the @xmath81 and @xmath45 stretch modes .",
    "this will also cause a higher excitation probability of the other modes , because the turn - around point will be some what later , which give effectively more repulsion on the other modes .",
    "we also observed that for both stretches the excitation probabilities shows the following trend ; three hydrogens @xmath101 two hydrogens @xmath101 one hydrogen pointing towards the surface . for one hydrogen pointing towards the surface",
    "the excitation probability of the @xmath45 asymmetrical stretch is around twice that of the @xmath81 symmetrical stretch , they are almost equal for two hydrogens , and for three hydrogens the @xmath81 is twice the @xmath45 stretch .",
    "some of these trends can also be found for the pes with @xmath100 , but are not always that obvious .",
    "they follow the same trends as the @xmath34 parameters of @xmath26 in table [ tab : alpha ] .",
    "@xmath92 ( see table [ tab : exprop ] ) gives also higher excitation probabilities for almost all modes than @xmath67 , but for the @xmath91 bending mode in the two hydrogens pointing towards the surface orientation it became lower .",
    "this means that the repulsion of the surface is here caused for a large part by the @xmath102 terms ( see eq .",
    "( [ vshift_d ] ) ) , where the @xmath91 bending modes do nt contribute .",
    "it is also in agreement with the fact that we have observed the excitation maximum earlier , so the @xmath26 repulsion on the @xmath91 bending modes will be lower .",
    "[ fig : potdif ] shows that the repulsion for the pes with @xmath92 is stronger than for the other three pess .",
    "the excitations in the @xmath81 and @xmath45 stretch modes are extremely high with @xmath92 , because they contribute strongly to the c  h bond elongation .",
    "the trend in the excitation probabilities of the @xmath81 symmetrical stretch mode is caused by the number of bonds pointing towards the surface , because the @xmath103 parameters are for all bonds and orientations the same , so only the strength of the coupling with the shift - factor dominates .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : symshift ] .",
    "we did nt observe this trend in the @xmath45 asymmetrical stretch mode , because there is also difference between the @xmath104 parameters as can be seen in table [ tab : gammaone ] and [ tab : gammatwo ] .",
    "if we put the methane molecule far from the surface , then all pess are identical .",
    "for this situation we calculated a bond distance of 1.165  and bond angle of 109.5 degrees in the ground state .",
    "the results of the maximum structure deformations are shown in the table [ tab : strdef ] .",
    "[ fig : orient ] shows the names of the bonds and angles for the three orientations .",
    "we observed that the pess with @xmath67 and @xmath99 give again the same trends , but that for the pes with @xmath99 these trends are much stronger .",
    "this is in agreement with the observations discussed for the excitation probabilities above .",
    "the deformations for the pes with @xmath92 are dominated by the change of the bond distances for the bonds which are pointing towards the surface .",
    "these bonds become longer for all orientations in the same order .",
    "so there is no orientational effect and this will be probably caused completely by the @xmath92 terms ( see eq .",
    "( [ vshift_d ] ) ) .    for the orientation with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface ( see table [ tab : strdef ] )",
    ", we observed that the bond pointing towards the surface becomes shorter , as expected , for the pes with @xmath67 and even more with @xmath99 .",
    "this is caused by the repulsion of the @xmath26 terms , which works in the direction of the bond axes .",
    "we observed also some small bond angle deformation .",
    "this is probably a secondary effect of the change in the bond distance and correlates to excitation of the @xmath63 umbrella mode .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath92 the bond length increases .",
    "clearly the effect of the change in equilibrium bond length is more effective than the repulsion with the surface",
    ". the shift effect may be somewhat too large , but the observed change ( 0.232  ) is much lower than the shift of the equilibrium ( 0.54  ) on which we fitted @xmath92 .",
    "we also observed for all orientations with @xmath92 an earlier turn - around point , which is in agreement with the earlier observed excitation maximum .",
    "this is caused by the extra repulsion contribution in the @xmath92 terms and by the longer bond length ; a longer bond gives a higher repulsion for the same position of the center of mass .",
    "[ fig : potdif ] shows this effect in the @xmath45 asymmetrical stretch mode .",
    "the orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the surface ( see table [ tab : strdef ] ) gives also shorter bond distances for the bonds pointing towards the surface for the pess with @xmath67 and @xmath99 , although very little in comparison to the one hydrogen orientation .",
    "we expected this , because just half of the repulsion is now in the direction of the bonds .",
    "the other half is perpendicular on the c ",
    "h bonds and this makes the bond angle larger .",
    "the bond angles between the bonds pointing towards the surface show a quite large deformation .",
    "this was already expected from the excitation of the @xmath91 bending and @xmath63 umbrella modes .",
    "we also observed that a smaller bond length of the bonds pointing towards the surface correlates with a larger bond angle of the angles between the bonds pointing towards the surface and a higher excitation probability of the @xmath91 bending mode .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "when the bonds become shorter the center of mass can come closer to the surface .",
    "because of this there will be more repulsion on the @xmath91 bending mode , which will cause a larger bond angle deformation .",
    "most of the deformations of the other bond angles can be explained as an indirect effect of the deformation of this bond angle , but the deformation of the angle between the bonds pointing away from the surface which was seen at the pes with @xmath92 must be caused by the excitation of the @xmath63 umbrella mode .",
    "we observed almost no change in bond length for the pess with @xmath105 and @xmath99 at the three hydrogens towards the surface orientation ( see table [ tab : strdef ] ) .",
    "almost all energy is absorbed by the @xmath63 umbrella mode , so this gives quite large bond angle deformations .",
    "the bond angle deformation is larger for the pes with @xmath99 than with @xmath67 pes ; in agreement with higher excitation probability for the pes with @xmath99 . the pes with @xmath92 has around the same excitation probabilities for the @xmath63 umbrella mode as the pes with @xmath99 , but the bond angle deformation is the same as for the pes with @xmath67 .",
    "this may be caused by the higher excitations of the @xmath81 and @xmath45 stretch modes and the longer bonds pointing towards the surface at the pes with @xmath92 , which can make it harder to deform the bond angles .",
    "several dissociation mechanisms for direct methane dissociation on transition metals have been suggested .",
    "all proposals can be related to two main ideas .",
    "one of them is the breaking of a single c ",
    "h bond in the initial collision.@xcite this model is most suggested in literature and also all wavepacket simulations have focussed on the effects of this model.@xcite the other mechanism is often called `` splats '' and suggests that the critical requirement for methane dissociation is angular deformation of methane which allows a ni ",
    "c bond to form.@xcite even though we did not try to describe the dissociation itself , we would like to discuss the implication of our simulation for the dissociation .    the `` splats '' model seems easiest to discuss .",
    "angular deformation is related to the @xmath91 bending and the @xmath63 umbrella mode .",
    "the excitation probabilities in table  [ tab : exprop ] seem to indicate that these modes are easy to excite , and that angular deformation should be large .",
    "these excitation probabilities are misleading , however .",
    "table  [ tab : strdef ] shows that , although the excitation probabilities depend on the pes , the changes in the bond angles do not . moreover , these changes are quite small .",
    "they are largest for the orientation with two hydrogen atoms pointing towards to surface , for which they are about @xmath106degrees at most .",
    "this seems much too small to enable the formation of a ni ",
    "a previous estimate of the bond angle deformation gave an energy of @xmath107kj / mol to get three hydrogens and the carbon in one plane .",
    "this correspond to a bond angle of @xmath108degrees.@xcite we find with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface that the bond angle only changes to about @xmath109degrees at the higher energy of @xmath110kj / mol .",
    "the reason for this difference is that for the older estimate it was assumed that all translational energy can be used to deform the bond angle , whereas tables  [ tab : exprop ] and [ tab : strdef ] clearly show that this is not correct .",
    "the excitation probabilities for the stretch modes depend strongly on the orientation of the molecule and on the pes . for the pess without a change of the equilibrium bond length the excitation probabilities are only appreciably with one hydrogen pointing towards the surface .",
    "this is , however , not a favourable orientation for the dissociation .",
    "moreover , table  [ tab : strdef ] shows that in those cases the repulsion with the surface shortens the c  h bond .",
    "the same holds for the orientation with two hydrogens pointing towards the surface , although to a lesser extent , whereas the bond length changes hardly at all with three hydrogens pointing towards the surface .",
    "this indicates that the intramolecular pes needs the bond elongation to overcome the repulsion of the surface that shortens the c  h bond , and to get dissociation .",
    "this agrees completely with electronic structure calculations that yield a late barrier for dissociation with a very elongated c  h bond.@xcite the large excitation probabilities for the pes with the elongated equilibrium bond length should not be over - interpreted , however .",
    "they are to be expected even if the molecule stays in its ( shifted ) vibrational ground state .",
    "more telling is that for this pes we do find at least some inelastic scattering .",
    "we have done wavepacket simulations on the scattering of methane from a flat ni(111 ) model surface with a fixed orientation with one , two , or three hydrogens pointing towards the surface .",
    "we used the mctdh method and four different model pess for each orientation .",
    "we used a translational energy of up to @xmath110kj / mol and all internal vibrations in the ground state .",
    "the scattering was in all cases predominantly elastic .",
    "when the molecule hits the surface , we always observe vibrational excitations of the @xmath63 umbrella and @xmath91 bending modes , especially in the orientations with two or three hydrogens pointing towards the surface .",
    "this is due to a favorable coupling that originates from the repulsive interaction with the surface , and the low excitation energies .",
    "deformations of the molecule are predominantly in the bond angles .",
    "the changes in the bond angles are , however , too small to allow for the formation of a ni  c bond , as suggested in the `` splats '' model of methane dissociation .",
    "appreciable excitations of the @xmath81 and @xmath45 stretch modes when methane hits the surface are only observed when one hydrogen atom points towards the surface , or when the intramolecular pes has an elongated equilibrium c  h bond length close to the surface .",
    "the repulsion of the surface shortens the c  h bond .",
    "this can only be overcome when the intramolecular pes incorporates the effect of a longer equilibrium c  h bond length caused by overlap of occupied surface orbitals with the antibonding orbitals of methane .",
    "this agrees with quantum chemical calculations , which show a late barrier for dissociation .",
    "the simulations with these model pess show that the internal vibrations play an important role in the dissociation mechanism .",
    "excitation probabilities when the molecule hits the surface show how the translational energy is converted into vibrational energy and it is distributed over the internal modes .",
    "these probabilities vary strongly with the pes .",
    "as only few internal vibrations contribute to the dissociation , it is important to obtain more information on the real pes for this system .",
