    "finite - size effect on this singular diamagnetism has been theoretically studied for carbon nanotubes @xcite and graphene ribbons .",

    "the horizontal and vertical axes are scaled by @xmath33 respectively .",
    "@xmath34 represents the energy scale in the dirac cone associated with the length scale @xmath35 .",
    "we also calculated the susceptibility for different system sizes and found that for each of four types , the susceptibility and the level structure plotted in this scale becomes almost universal as long as @xmath36 .",
    "this is naturally expected from the fact that the low - energy physics are well described by the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "upper figure in each panel presents the energy level structure at @xmath37 , where dashed ( black ) lines are non - degenerate levels , and solid ( red ) lines are two - fold degenerate levels . in the low temperature regime ,",
    "@xmath38 , we observe that the susceptibility abruptly changes at every single energy level , and in particular , it exhibits sharp spikes toward the paramagnetic direction ( downward in the figure ) at two - fold degenerate levels .",
    "this is because the degenerate states , having opposite magnetic moments , split linearly in magnetic field just like spin zeeman splitting , and induce paramagnetism in an analogous way to spin pauli paramagnetism .",
    "the contribution to the orbital susceptibility ( per area ) from the degenerate states at @xmath39 is written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the magnetic moments of the doublet .",
    "the typical magnitude of @xmath20 is shown to be @xmath42 , which is the only magnetic - moment scale in the massless dirac system .",
    "the major difference between armchair flakes and zigzag flakes comes from the existence of the zero - energy edge states peculiar to the zigzag edge .",
    "@xcite in the triangular zigzag flake , fig .",
    "[ mag_mu](d ) , there are a number of energy levels exactly at zero energy,@xcite of which wavefunctions are shown to be localized at the edge , and the degeneracy is the order of @xmath43 . remarkably , the susceptibility in the low temperature regime is completely flat at these levels , meaning that the edge states have absolutely no contribution to the orbital magnetism .",
    "this is simply because the edge states are locked to zero energy even in the presence of magnetic field , and never participate in the total energy change . in the hexagonal zigzag flake , fig .",
    "[ mag_mu](c ) , on the other hand , the edge levels slightly shift from zero energy , leading to some small contributions to the orbital susceptibility .",
    "the energy shift arises because the edge states on neighboring sides of the hexagon always reside at different sublattices , and they are hybridized by some finite matrix element including @xmath7 .",

    "we see that the finite - size effect almost vanishes in this temperature regime , giving a universal curve independent of the atomic configuration .",
    "the curves still slightly differ near the central peak , because the level spacing around the dirac point , which is about @xmath52 , is not completely negligible compared to @xmath53 at this particular system size",
    ". this small variance would vanish in larger flakes which satisfy @xmath54 .",
    "the curve is characterized by the strong diamagnetic peak at the dirac point and some smaller structures off the dirac point .",
    "the contribution from the lower - half spectrum adds up to a paramagnetic offset to the central diamagnetic peak .",
    "namely , the susceptibility near @xmath55 is approximately written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is given by eq .",
    "( [ bd ] ) , and @xmath58 the offset @xmath59 is much smaller than the height of the central peak @xmath60 , since @xmath61 is usually much smaller than @xmath7 . outside the dirac cone region ,",

    "the flux circulates entirely on the system reflecting the absence of the characteristic wave length in graphene .",
    "as temperature becomes higher , it is going to be localized near the edge .",
    "the current circulation of zigzag and armchair graphene flakes are globally similar , but the flux lines of armchair flakes exhibit some roughness while it is not observed in zigzag flakes .",
    "this actually corresponds to the atomic - scale current circulation in the kekul pattern seen in the original current map ( left inset ) , @xcite which is caused by the inter - valley ( between @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) hybridization peculiar to the armchair edge .",

    "we can show that , however , the integrated edge current approximates @xmath81 independently of the edge type , in the high temperature regime @xmath82 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the orbital susceptibility is then given by the bulk limit regardless of the atomic configuration .",
    "when comparing hexagonal and triangular flakes of the same edge type , we see that the curves are almost completely equivalent in @xmath82 .",
    "this suggests that the edge current distribution in high temperature is solely determined by the local edge configuration , independently of the global shape .",
    "the orbital magnetism always competes with the spin paramagnetism which has been neglected so far .",
