    "tungsten is foreseen as a coating material for plasma facing components in future fusion tokamaks because of its favorable thermo - mechanical properties .",
    "it is the material of choice for the divertor @xcite of the international iter tokamak , currently under construction at the cadarache research center in france .",
    "tungsten has already been used successfully in asdex upgrade @xcite and in on - going studies of the iter - like wall configuration at jet @xcite . in all these devices",
    "it is inevitable that tungsten is sputtered off the inner walls of the vacuum vessel and so contaminates the fusion plasma .",

    "electron - impact excitation and electron - ion recombination of highly charged tungsten ions lead to subsequent emission of energetic photons which leave the plasma . above a certain level of tungsten concentration in the core plasma ,",
    "these radiation losses limit the plasma operation and performance .",
    "plasma model calculations suggest that the fraction of tungsten ions in the core plasma must not exceed a few @xmath4 , otherwise plasma burning can not be sustained @xcite . in order to understand the composition of impurities in the plasma , detailed knowledge of the atomic structure of tungsten ions and of the atomic collision processes of tungsten ions in the plasma",
    "is required .",
    "thus , excitation , ionization and recombination processes involving tungsten ions are of major interest for the fusion community .",
    "current plasma models for tungsten @xcite use theoretical recombination rate coefficients from the adas database which are based on the semi - empirical burgess general formula @xcite , as discussed in ref .",

    "the modeling became increasingly difficult due to the associated large number of spectral lines .",
    "the resulting quasi - continuum in the spectrum prevented identification of individual charge states . in order to reproduce the observed line intensities by models , accurate rate coefficients for the dominant excitation , ionization , and recombination",
    "processes are needed .",
    "theoretical predictions are challenging because of the complex electronic structure involved .",
    "in this situation , experimental recombination rate coefficients are needed to benchmark theory .    to date",
    ", only a single direct measurement of a recombination rate coefficient of highly charged tungsten ions has been published , namely for w@xmath6([kr]@xmath7 ) forming w@xmath8 @xcite . for this open-@xmath3-shell tungsten ion",
    "it was found that the recombination rate coefficient is dominated by resonant processes such as dielectronic recombination ( dr ) , in particular at energies below 50  ev , while contributions from radiative recombination ( rr ) are negligible .",
    "the strong , mutually overlapping , low - energy recombination resonances have a significant impact on the total recombination rate coefficient even at the rather high plasma temperatures of interest for fusion devices .",
    "a discrepancy of a factor of four was found between the experimental results and the adas recombination rate coefficient .",
    "subsequent to the measurement for w@xmath6 , new theoretical calculations of recombination rate coefficients of xe - like tungsten have been carried out .",
    "the theoretical calculations have been challenged by the extraordinary complexity of the open-@xmath3-shell atomic structure of w@xmath6 . for such complex systems , the common approach of including correlations via large configuration interaction expansions",
    "can not be applied to the extent that would be necessary to obtain results with sufficient accuracy . consequently , intermediate coupling ( ic ) calculations @xcite result in smaller resonance strengths than the measured ones at low collision energies .    while the cause of this discrepancy is well understood now ,",
    "it is technically hard to overcome . in this situation ,",
    "statistical theory @xcite provides a useful framework for estimating the missing  recombination resonance strength . the application of statistical theory to describe the highly - mixed dielectronic capture / autoionization processes via a breit - wigner redistribution leads to much better agreement with the experimental merged - beam rate coefficient for w@xmath6 @xcite , at least at very low energies . at higher energies , autoionization into excited states becomes energetically possible and this greatly suppresses , or damps , the dr rate coefficient , as was evidenced by the ic results in ref .",

    "the present measurements were performed at the tsr heavy - ion storage ring @xcite of the max planck institute for nuclear physics in heidelberg , germany .",
    "the experimental procedures and data analysis are very similar to the ones used in our previous study on w@xmath6 ions  @xcite .",
    "w@xmath0 ions were produced by stripping of a parent beam of negatively charged tungsten carbide that was created in an ion sputter source delivering currents of about 12  @xmath9a .",
    "the wc@xmath10 ions were injected into a tandem accelerator where carbon atoms and electrons were stripped off by passing the beam through thin carbon foils . behind the acceleration section",
    "isotopically pure @xmath11w@xmath0 ions were selected using a dipole magnet and subsequently injected into the storage ring .",
    "the time - averaged electrical current behind the analyzing magnet was 250  pa .",
    "the kinetic energy of the stored ions was 169  mev , corresponding to a velocity of 4.5% of the speed of light .",
    "the tsr electron cooler was used for electron cooling of the stored w@xmath0 ion beam and as an electron target for the present recombination measurements .",
    "the recombined w@xmath2 ions were separated from the stored w@xmath0 beam in the tsr bending magnet following the cooler .",
    "the recombination products were detected by a channeltron - based single particle detector @xcite with practically 100% detection efficiency .",
    "count rates of up to several tens of khz were recorded . at these count rates",
    "dead time effects were negligible since the detection system can process count rates of up to several hundreds of khz .    at the beginning of each measurement cycle",
    "w@xmath0 ions were injected into the storage ring and first cooled for 1.5  s with the cooler cathode voltage adjusted for matching electron and ion velocities .",
    "the 1.5  s cooling time also allowed for the de - excitation of metastable w@xmath0 ions that are produced in the foil - stripping process . for an estimation of the remaining metastable fraction in the cooled - ion beam , lifetimes of metastable levels of the w@xmath0 ground configuration [ kr]@xmath12 and of the first excited configurations [ kr]@xmath13 and",
    "[ kr]@xmath14 were calculated employing the autostructure atomic structure code ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : theo ] ) . in this calculation , the ground level is found to be [ kr]@xmath15 as was predicted earlier @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are 1670 excited levels within the chosen set of electron configurations .",
    "their excitation energies range up to about 114  ev above the ground level .",
    "their lifetimes were determined by calculating e1 , m1 , and e2 radiative transition rates to all accessible energetically lower states .",
    "the results for all levels with lifetimes longer than 10  ms can be found in tab .",
    "[ tab : meta ] .    except for the [ kr]@xmath16 level that has a radiative lifetime of about 12 years , all of the calculated lifetimes are below one second .",
    "all calculated transition rates were used to simulate the level populations in the stored w@xmath0 beam as a function of storage time . to this end , a set of coupled rate equations @xcite has been solved numerically . as an initial condition , a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of the levels @xcite has been assumed .",
    "figure [ fig : meta ] shows the resulting populations as a function of storage time .",
    "after 1  s about 90% of the stored ions have decayed to the ground level and most of the remaining 10% have accumulated in the long - lived metastable [ kr]@xmath16 level .",
    "this result is largely independent of the temperature that characterized the boltzmann distribution of initial level populations .",
    "thus , we conclude that , after the initial cooling of the ion beam , 90% of the stored w@xmath0 ions were in the [ kr]@xmath15 ground level and 10% remained in the [ kr]@xmath16 level .",

    "the cathode voltage was ramped through a preselected range of values corresponding to the desired collision energy interval .",
    "each voltage range comprised 2000 discrete collision energy steps .",
    "the dwell time was 1  ms at each step , resulting in an overall ramping time of 2  s. fresh ions were injected into the storage ring and cooled for 1.5  s prior to the next ramping cycle .",
    "this scheme was repeated for usually about 1  h , then the energy range of interest was changed to the next interval .",
    "each scan over a certain energy range had 50% overlap with the previous measurement . in total , the present measurements comprise collision energies ranging from 0.2  mev to 300  ev .",
    "the experimental energy spread is determined by the velocity distributions of the ions and of the cooler electron beam .",
    "it can be characterized by the longitudinal and transverse temperatures @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite . for a well - cooled ion beam ,",
    "the velocity distribution of the ions can be neglected and the experimental energy spread is determined by the electron beam temperatures only . in the present experiment the ion beam is only cooled for 1.5  s after injection and there is no beam cooling during the ramping cycles .",
    "therefore , the collision velocity spread , and , hence , the effective temperatures are higher than with the usual experimental scheme ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) where beam cooling is applied in between two cooler cathode voltage steps . from the comparison between our theoretical calculations and our experimental measurements ( see below ) we infer @xmath40  mev and @xmath41  mev as rough estimates . with these temperatures the experimental energy spread @xcite is 0.05  ev at an energy of 1  ev and 0.80  ev at 290  ev .    for the present measurements , no dedicated effort has been made to calibrate the experimental energy scale beyond the accuracy that is determined by the merged - beam experiment itself .",
    "the velocity - matching condition , corresponding to vanishing collision energy of electrons and ions and referred to as the 0  ev case , is found by observing the cusp in the rate at the recombination detector as a function of the electron acceleration voltage .",
    "the acceleration voltage difference to this 0  ev structure defines the experimental electron - ion collision energy @xcite .",
    "its systematic uncertainty lies at sub - mev values near 0 ev and increases with increasing energy .",
    "a conservative estimate @xcite yields systematic uncertainties of 0.3 and 1.2  ev at electron - ion collision energies of 10 and 300  ev , respectively .      from the signal count rate @xmath42 registered by the recombination detector",
    ", the merged - beam recombination rate coefficient as a function of collision energy @xmath43 is derived as @xcite @xmath44 here , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the ion and electron velocities , respectively , in the laboratory frame of reference in units of the speed of light , @xmath47 is the detection efficiency , @xmath48 is the number of stored ions , @xmath49 is the electron density in the interaction region , and @xmath50  m is the tsr closed orbit circumference .",
    "the effective length @xmath51 of the interaction region is different from the length @xmath52  m of the cooler , because the velocity vectors of electrons and ions point into different directions in the toroidal merging and demerging sections of the cooler .",
    "this shortens the length of the merging section , where electrons and ions move with the preset relative velocity ; and in the toroidal sections it introduces higher electron - ion collision energies than the nominal set value .",
    "this affects the measured merged - beam rate coefficient , in particular , in energy ranges where it exhibits steep gradients . in principle",
    ", this effect can be accounted for by a deconvolution procedure @xcite .",
    "however , this procedure requires knowledge of the electron - ion recombination rate coefficient at higher energies , which is presently not available .",
    "therefore , we have chosen @xmath53  m as the mean value of the geometrically shortest ( 1.3  m , excluding the toroidal sections ) and longest ( 1.5  m , including toroid sections ) overlap lengths , with the uncertainty being half the difference between these two values .    usually , the number @xmath48 of stored ions is derived from the measured ion current in the storage ring . however , under the present experimental conditions the ion current was too low to be measured using the tsr ion current transformer .",
    "therefore , in a first step , a relative recombination rate coefficient was obtained by normalization of the measured recombination count rate to a proxy of the ion current . in a second step ,",
    "detailed below , the resulting relative recombination rate coefficient was scaled to the separately measured absolute rate coefficient at zero electron - ion collision energy .",
    "the ion current proxy was obtained from the count rate of w@xmath8 ions , resulting from ionization in residual gas collisions , on an appropriately situated detector similar to the one used to record the recombination signal .",
    "the measurement energy range was well below the ionization threshold of w@xmath0 at 462.1  ev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ionization signal only depends on the parent ion current and the density of the residual gas , which is assumed to be constant in the relevant part of the tsr for the duration of the data taking .    the relative recombination rate coefficient from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel ] ) contains a background that results from electron capture during collisions of the w@xmath0 primary ions with residual gas particles .",
    "usually , this background is measured by inserting interleaving reference energy steps into the sequence of measurement energies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , this procedure significantly reduces the duty cycle of the measurement procedure . in view of the extremely short beam lifetime of only 1.6  s ( see below ) no interleaving reference steps were used for the present measurements .",
    "instead , we assume that the recombination background from collisions is independent of the electron - ion collision energy and take as a background the lowest measured recombination count - rate level which was measured at an electron - ion collision energy of @xmath54260  ev .",
    "after this background subtraction , the relative recombination rate coefficient , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel ] ) , is put on an absolute scale as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : abs ] . with this normalization",
    ", the absolute rate coefficient at low energy is found to range up to @xmath55  @xmath56  s@xmath57 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : resmb ] ) . at energies above 220  ev its value becomes smaller than @xmath58  @xmath56  @xmath59 and monotonically further decreases up to @xmath60 250  ev .",
    "nevertheless , the measured signal at 260  ev can still contain contributions from electron - ion recombination events that have occurred in the cooler .",
    "these would be falsely subtracted in the background removal described above . in order to account for at least part of this signal",
    "we re - added , after background subtraction and proper absolute normalization ( see below ) , a theoretical rate coefficient for radiative recombination ( cf .",
    ",  sec .",
    "[ sec : theo ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that both the residual variation of @xmath61 above 220  ev and the re - added radiative recombination rate coefficient ( @xmath62  @xmath56  s@xmath57 at 260 ev ) represent only small corrections to the total rate coefficient .",
    "the major uncertainty associated with the present background correction procedure comes from the neglect of unresolved recombination resonances which also may contribute to the measured recombination signal at 260  ev . if such resonances were present , too much background would have been subtracted , and our experimental rate coefficient would be too small .",
    "however , our theoretical calculations do not suggest strong recombination resonances at electron - ion collision energies around 260  ev ( see below ) .",
    "lifetime measurements of the stored ion beam with the cooler electron - beam off and on , respectively .",
    "after 3.5  s the electron - beam was switched on .",
    "the symbols represent the measured count rate on the recombination detector .",
    "the white solid lines are exponential decay fits to these data points . ]    as in our previous study with w@xmath6 ions @xcite , the absolute recombination rate coefficient @xmath63 at a collision energy of 0  ev was determined by monitoring the storage lifetime of the w@xmath0 ion beam .",
    "to this end , the count rate of the recombined w@xmath2 has been recorded as a function of beam storage time .",
    "the lifetime of the ion beam is limited by collisions with residual gas particles .",
    "due to additional electron - ion recombination , the lifetime is even further reduced when the electron beam of the cooler is switched on .",
    "the measured count rates over time , with the cooler switched on and off , were fitted with separate exponential decay functions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : life ] ) .",
    "the absolute recombination rate coefficient can be determined from the respective beam lifetimes @xmath64 and @xmath65 obtained from the fits via @xcite @xmath66 the electron density at zero electron - ion collision energy was @xmath67  @xmath56 .",
    "the beam lifetimes @xmath68  s and @xmath69  s. these values were obtained by averaging over the fit results from three separate measurements and result in @xmath70  @xmath56  s@xmath57 .",
    "the separate fit results from each individual measurement agreed within the uncertainties from the fit .",
    "the quoted uncertainties correspond to a 90% confidence interval .",
    "this absolute recombination rate coefficient at 0  ev collision energy was then used to normalize the relative merged - beam recombination rate coefficient which was obtained by scanning the collision energy as described above .",
    "it should be noted that the energy - independent factor @xmath71 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel ] ) , that accounts for the metastable ion fraction in the parent ion beam , effectively does not enter the absolute normalization of the cross section via eq .",
    "( [ eq : abs ] ) . in principle",
    ", one could expect different beam lifetimes for ground state ions and metastable ions .",
    "this would lead to double - exponential decays for each part of fig .",
    "[ fig : life ] .",
    "however , the observed beam decays in fig .",
    "[ fig : life ] are both single - exponential .",
    "there are two possible explanations .",
    "the long - lived [ kr]@xmath72 level is not significantly populated .",
    "second , the relevant collision cross sections are nearly the same for both the [ kr]@xmath72 metastable level and the [ kr]@xmath73 ground level . consequently , the decay curves do not allow one to discriminate between the two levels and the derived value for @xmath63 is independent of the population of the metastable level . in either case ,",
    "@xmath63 is the correct value for the recombination rate coefficient of ground - level ions and there is no additional uncertainty of this value related to @xmath71 .    at a confidence limit of 90% , the statistical error of the absolute rate coefficient at zero collision energy amounts to 4.2% .",
    "systematic uncertainties of the absolute rate coefficient arise from several sources .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of the effective interaction length amounts to 7% and that of the electron density to 1% @xcite .",
    "the systematic error from background subtraction depends on the collision energy . at 0 ev , where the recombination rate coefficient is independently measured via eq .",
    "( 2 ) , there is no influence of the background subtraction at all . at high collision energies of 220  ev , where the residual recombination signal after the background subtraction is small , the resulting uncertainty amounts to @xmath5480% . at intermediate energies of 1  ev and 30  ev , the background subtraction procedure results in systematic uncertainties of 2% and 25% , respectively . since all these uncertainties are independent of each other , they need to be summed in quadrature .",
    "in addition to the systematic uncertainty there is a counting - statistical error on the relative recombination rate coefficient ( as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : exptheo ] ) , which varies with energy as well .",
    "the total uncertainty of the data at a 90% confidence limit , i.e. , the quadrature sum of systematic and statistical uncertainty , ranges from 8% at 0 ev across 9% at 1 ev , 38% at 30 ev and 120% at 220 ev , as the rate coefficient approaches zero .",
    "different errors are derived for the plasma rate coefficient as detailed below .",
    "our basic approach to dielectronic recombination is detailed in @xcite .",
    "we use the independent processes , isolated resonances plus distorted waves ( ipirdw ) approximation .",
    "we energy - average each resonance over a width of energy @xmath74 which is chosen to be large compared to the resonance width and small compared to the characteristic width of any subsequent convolution .",

    "it is convenient to bin  the cross section via @xmath96 where @xmath97 ( for the linear case ) .",
    "the sum over @xmath80 is over all final states which lie below the ionization limit of the recombined ion @xmath81 .",
    "this sum may include cascade through autoionizing levels in general although we do not need to consider it here .",
    "the sums over @xmath80 and @xmath79 are taken to convergence to obtain total rate coefficients for application to low - density plasmas but the sum over @xmath80 ( and hence @xmath79 ) normally needs to be truncated for application to laboratory measurements .",
    "our calculational approach closely follows that used for w@xmath6 @xcite , with one extension .",
    "we used the program autostructure @xcite to calculate all energy levels , radiative rates and autoionization rates necessary to describe the full range of two - step dr reactions which take place via @xmath98 and @xmath99 promotions of @xmath100 and @xmath3 electrons from the w@xmath0 ground - state .",
    "we used configuration - average- , @xmath101-  , and intermediate - coupling schemes .",
    "the purpose of using multiple coupling schemes is to study the convergence of theory with experiment at low energies as the amount of mixing of autoionizing states is increased  see fig .  5 of @xcite .",
    "even the intermediate coupling results fall short of experiment because we are restricted to mixing autoionizing states which result from one - electron promotions ( plus capture ) .",
    "there are many more autoionizing states present which result from multiple - electron promotions ( plus capture ) .",
    "these are not populated directly by dielectronic capture from the ground state since this is mediated by a two - body operator .",
    "nevertheless , such forbidden  capture states could typically radiatively stabilize at a rate @xmath102 comparable with that for an allowed  capture , if they were populated somehow .",
    "such population occurs through mixing of doubly excited states with - and - between multiply excited states .",

    "the open @xmath80-shell is a situation where such redistributive mixing occurs .",

    "in particular , in the range where w@xmath0 is expected to exist in a collisionally ionized plasma , the discrepancy still amounts to factors of 510 . since this discrepancy is similar to what has been found earlier already for w@xmath6 @xcite we expect that recombination rate coefficients from the adas data base are significantly in error also for tungsten ions of neighboring charge states .",
    "the present fruitful interplay between experiment and theory has clearly lead to a much better understanding of recombination in multi - electron ions with very complex atomic structure . in the near future",
