    "the intensive interest in @xmath10-meson production in different elementary reactions is mainly related to the investigation of the okubo - zweig - iizuka(ozi ) rule violation  @xcite which is thought to originate from the strangeness degrees of freedom in the nucleon and nucleon resonances .",
    "based on the ozi rule , the ratio of @xmath10- to @xmath11-meson production under similar kinematic conditions are expected to be @xmath12  @xcite , with the small deviation @xmath13 from ideal mixing of octet and singlet isoscalar vector mesons at the quark level . a significantly apparent ozi rule violation , however , was reported in @xmath14 annihilation at the lear facility at cern  @xcite .",
    "some authors attributed the origin of the ozi rule violation to the shake - out and rearrangement of the intrinsic @xmath6 content in the quark wave function of the nucleon  @xcite , which was indicated by the analysis of the @xmath15-nucleon @xmath16-term  @xcite and the lepton deep - inelastic scattering data  @xcite .",
    "this picture has also been applied to the @xmath10-meson electro- and photoproduction off the proton  @xcite , and may give a natural explanation to the empiric evidence of a positive strangeness magnetic moment of the proton  @xcite .",
    "recently , ozi rule violation was found in the @xmath17 collisions at the anke facility at cosy  @xcite , and they obtained @xmath18  @xcite , and @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical articles  @xcite were published trying to advance our understanding on this problem . using a relativistic meson exchange model , nakayama et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that the mesonic current involving the ozi rule violating @xmath20 vertex is dominant , while the nucleonic current contribution had effect on the angular distribution due to its destructive interference with the mesonic current .",
    "they did not consider the possible role of the nucleon resonances , because there were no experimentally observed baryonic resonances which would decay into the @xmath21 channel , and also the existing data were not enough to extract the parameters relevant to the resonances .",
    "however , the paper as well as other ones  @xcite on the @xmath1 reaction did not give a simultaneous good predictions to the total cross section and angular distribution measured recently by cosy - anke collaboration  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that the contributions from sub-@xmath21-threshold @xmath0 resonance were dominant to the near - threshold @xmath10 production in proton - proton and @xmath22 collisions , and all the experimental data could be nicely reproduced by the model .    in this paper , we extend the model  @xcite to study the @xmath23 reaction without introducing any further model parameters .",
    "we assume the reaction is predominantly proceeded through the excitation and decay of the sub-@xmath21-threshold @xmath5 resonance with the final nucleons merging to form the deuteron .",

    "@xmath78 is the deuteron internal momentum and @xmath79 is the polarization vector of the deuteron .",
    "we neglect the d - wave part of the deuteron wave function since it gives only a minor contribution  @xcite , and the s - wave deuteron wave function @xmath80 can be parameterized as the reid soft core wave function  @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the results with parameterized hulthn wave function  @xcite , which has distinctive difference from reid soft core wave function only below @xmath81 fm .",
    "it gives about 20% smaller cross section without changing the shape of the angular distribution much and is still compatible with available experimental data .",
    "so the different choice of the deuteron wave function does not affect our final conclusions .",
    "but since reid soft core wave function is a more realistic description of deuteron , hereafter our calculations are all based on the reid soft core",
    ".    then the invariant amplitude can be obtained straightforwardly by applying the feynman rules to fig . 1 . here",
    "we take explicitly the @xmath82 exchange and projectile excitation diagram as an example , @xmath83 where the form factor for @xmath5 resonance , @xmath84 , is taken as , @xmath85 with @xmath86 = 2.0 gev .",

    "according to pdg  @xcite , the dominant decay channels for the @xmath5 resonance are @xmath8 and @xmath93 , so we take , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the following two - body phase space factor , @xmath96 it is too computer - time - consuming to directly compute eq .",

    "all the four momenta in @xmath108 are dependent on the @xmath99 and should be integrated out , @xmath109 this prescription could largely reduce the laborious computation , and a comparison of the full calculation eq .",

    "@xcite of @xmath113 reaction , contribution from the @xmath15-meson exchange is larger than that from the @xmath34-meson exchange by a factor of 2 .",
    "contrarily , in fig .  [ tcs ]",
    ", we can see that @xmath34-meson exchange is larger than @xmath15-meson exchange by a factor 2 in @xmath114 reaction in the present calculation .",
    "the main reason is that the use of deuteron wave function for the @xmath115 final state interaction gives an enhancement factor to the @xmath34 exchange diagram about a factor of 4 larger than to the @xmath15 exchange compared with results without including any @xmath115 fsi . in the calculation",
    "@xcite of @xmath116 reaction , a simple global jost factor is used for the @xmath117 fsi as many other previous calculations , and gives an equal enhancement factor to all meson exchanges . as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , this kind of treatment of fsi seems too simple . for the @xmath118 , the use of paris wave function for the nn fsi results in enhancement factor about a factor of 1.75 larger for the @xmath34 exchange than for the @xmath15 exchange . in our present calculation of @xmath114 reaction with @xmath115 as a bound state",
    ", the enhancement factor is then understandably more larger for @xmath34 exchange than for the @xmath15 exchange .",
    "the contribution from @xmath33-meson exchange is about three orders of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath34-meson exchange .",
    "this relative magnitude is smaller compared to the case of @xmath113 reaction .",
    "the relative suppression of @xmath33-meson exchange is due to its iso - scalar property while the iso - vector mesons play more important role in the @xmath115 interaction due to participation of their charged members .",
    "the simple incoherent sum of these contributions can give a nice description of the experimental data .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ dcs ] , our calculated @xmath10-meson polar angular distributions are compatible with the experimental data and show some structure in high excess energy .",
    "it is seen that our angular distributions of @xmath119 follow the behaviour of the corresponding distributions in @xmath120 reaction , modified slightly by the neutron - proton - deuteron vertex .",
    "the upward bending at forward and backward angles becomes more pronounced with the increasing excess energy , and it would be possible for the experiment performed in higher energies to verify these structures .",

    "the dotted , dashed , dash - dotted and solid curve correspond to contribution from @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath3meson exchange and their simple sum , respectively .",
    "the data are from ref.@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]      there are some interesting findings if we compare our results with those of others . in the model of nakayama et al .",
    "@xcite , only mesonic and nucleonic current were considered , and they claimed that it was necessary to introduce an ozi rule violation at the @xmath20 vertex in the mesonic current , which provided the enhancement of the @xmath10-meson production .",
    "four parameter sets extracted from the analysis of @xmath121 were used to study the @xmath114 reaction , but none of them could give a simultaneous explanation to the experimental data . the model parameter sets 1 and 2 underestimated the total cross section slightly though they can give a fairly flat angular distributions up to excess energy 100 mev .",
    "the sets 3 and 4 reproduced much better the total cross section but the predicted angular distributions showed obvious downward bending at forward and backward angles , which was somewhat inconsistent with the experimental data .",
    "those characteristics might mean that it could not reasonably account for the reaction dynamics of the @xmath114 reaction by only including mesonic and nucleonic currents .",
    "kaptari et al .",
    "@xcite used a modified model including the bremsstrahlung and conversion diagrams , corresponding to the nucleonic and mesonic currents respectively , and found conversion diagrams were predominant without introducing obvious ozi violation in @xmath20 vertex .",
    "they predicted a rather small total cross section though their angular distribution results in the near - threshold region seemed to be consistent with the experimental data .",
    "another theoretical work was finished by grishina et al .",
    "@xcite , and their two - step model slightly underestimated the total cross section , though this might be attributed to the adopted large normalization factor arising from the initial state interaction .",
    "this normalization factor seemed to be somewhat arbitrary and it was a pity that they did not give their angular distributions .",
    "as clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tcs ] and fig .",
    "[ dcs ] as well as ref .",
    "@xcite , if the @xmath0 resonance is dominant in the @xmath10 production in nucleon - nucleon collisions , a consistent description of @xmath122 and @xmath123 reactions can be acquired .",
    "certainly , it has to be admitted that it can not definitely exclude the contribution from the mesonic and nucleonic current because alternative combination of those currents and @xmath0 resonance would yield a good fit to the present data .",
    "especially , it is noted that @xmath0 resonance gives upward bending but those currents give downward bending at forward and backward angles , and their merging is expected to give much flatter angular distributions as present data have shown .",
    "the higher energy data should be helpful to decide the portion of these contributions since the bending behavior is more prominent for the excess energy above 100mev .    according to above analysis , it is safe to conclude that the contribution from @xmath0 resonance plays important role for the @xmath10-meson production in @xmath17 collisions and may be the real origin of the large ozi rule violation .",
    "the significant @xmath124 coupling alone would be enough to explain the enhancement in the @xmath10-meson production in @xmath17 collisions , and this may indicate large @xmath6 component in quark wave function of @xmath0 resonance and hence the large coupling of @xmath0 to strangeness decay channels  @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath124 coupling should also play important role in other relevant processes . in the study of the @xmath10-meson production in the @xmath125 annihilations , the strange hadron loops , such as @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 loops ,",
    "are found to play important role  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the contribution through @xmath5 and @xmath129 excitations . for the @xmath130 reaction , although the total cross sections can be reproduced by the t - channel @xmath34 exchange and/or subthreshold nucleon pole contributions  @xcite , these contributions are very sensitive to the choice of off - shell form factors for the t - channel @xmath34 exchange and the @xmath131 couplings and can be reduced by orders of magnitude within uncertainties of these ingredients .",
    "alternative mechanisms  @xcite with large @xmath5 contribution can reproduce data perfectly . for the @xmath132 reaction , a much larger ozi rule violation for @xmath10-meson production",
    "was suggested  @xcite with no indications for s - channel resonances above threshold  @xcite . the t - channel diffractive pomeron exchange with photon transition to @xmath10",
    "is found to play dominant role  @xcite , but further mechanisms are needed to account for the bump structure in the forward angle differential cross section at low energy region  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to check the role of @xmath5 and/or other s - channel @xmath55 through polarization observables .",
    "the role of @xmath5 can also be further explored in the @xmath133he@xmath10 reaction  @xcite , though this channel is convoluted with the large momentum transfer between the deuteron and @xmath134he .",
    "a two - step model  @xcite underpredicted the total cross section by at least a factor of four , and the reaction dynamics involving @xmath0 resonance may be necessary to resolve the @xmath10 production mechanism in this reaction .    in summary , we have phenomenologically investigated the role of the @xmath0 resonance in @xmath119 reaction near threshold , and all model parameters are taken from a previous study of the @xmath120 reaction  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the including of the dominant @xmath0 resonance contribution is necessary to reproduce the recently measured total and differential cross sections , though mesonic and nucleonic currents might also have some minor contributions .",
    "we argue that the large coupling of the intermediate @xmath0 resonance to @xmath10-meson maybe an very important origin of the ozi rule violation in the @xmath10-meson production .",
