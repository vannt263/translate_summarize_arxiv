    "to that of zn , one can assess the quantity of interstellar grains in the systems .",
    "most chemical evolution models ( e.g. , malaney & chaboyer , 1996 ; pei , fall , & hauser , 1999 ) predict the global metallicity of the universe to rise from nearly zero at high @xmath15 to nearly solar at @xmath16 although galaxy to galaxy variation may be expected from the mass - metallicity relation ( tremonti et al . 2004 ; savaglio et al . 2005 ) as well as from gradients of abundance with galaxy radius ( i.e. ellison , kewley & malln - ornelas , 2005 ; chen et al .",

    "contrary to most models of cosmic chemical evolution , recent observations suggest a relatively mild evolution in dla global metallicity with redshift for 0@xmath18z@xmath18 4 ( prochaska 2003 ; khare , et  al . , 2004 ;",

    "similar values for the slope have been reported from previous zn samples ( @xmath22 ; kulkarni & fall 2002 ) , and from a larger heterogeneous sample of zn , fe , si , s , and x - ray absorption measurements ( @xmath23 ; prochaska et al .",
    "overall the -weighted mean metallicity of dlas is less than 1/10@xmath5 solar at z=2 and about 1/6@xmath5 solar at z=1 ( meiring et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the global mean dla metallicity stays far below the solar level at all redshifts .",
    "however , the exact shape of the metallicity - redshift relation is still not accurately determined .",
    "this uncertainty is mainly due to the small number of measurements available at @xmath24 , which corresponds to @xmath25 of the age of the universe .",
    "in fact , most of the low - redshift data available so far are based on low - resolution spectroscopy . only 2 dlas with",
    "@xmath26 have been measured at high resolution , a dla at z=0.68 ( de la varga & reimers 2000 ) and a dla at z=0.86 ( pettini et al .",
    "this is primarily because ( a ) for @xmath27 , zn ii lines lie in the uv and can only be accessed with hst ( which currently has no high - resolution spectrograph working ) , and ( b ) for @xmath28 , zn ii lines lie in the blue wavelengths where most spectrographs have relatively low sensitivities . yet , high resolution is important both for lowering the detection threshold and for resolving blends of mg i and cr ii and the two zn ii lines at @xmath29 2026 2062 which are separated by 50 km / s and 62 km / s respectively .",
    "fortunately , new low - redshift dlas are being discovered rapidly .",
    "the 100,000 quasar spectra being obtained in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) combined with hst observations ( and future facilities ) are expected to increase the number of dlas by an order of magnitude ( york et al .",
    "2000 ; rao & turnshek 2000 ; york , et al . 2001 ; york et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it is important to determine the elemental abundances in these dlas which probe a large fraction of the age of the universe .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * @xmath30 : * the abundance in ca is a lower limit since the ionisation potential of ca ii ( 11.868 ev ) is lower than the one of hi and therefore ca ii represents only some of the total calcium contained in a neutral gas cloud .",
    "+      the resulting abundances for each of the systems under study are summarised in table  [ t : ab ] .",
    "all the absorbers are found to have metallicities larger than the -weighted mean metallicity for low - redshift dlas .",
    "overall the four quasar absorbers analysed here are amongst the most metal - rich systems known to date ( see also prochaska et al .",
    "the dla with = 20.70 towards sdss j0256@xmath110110 , in particular , has an almost solar metallicity : [ zn / h]=@xmath60.11@xmath70.04 .",
    "furthermore , the sub - dla with = 19.93 towards sdss j0134@xmath110051 studied here also yields an upper limit [ zn / h]@xmath80.36 which is consistent with this absorber being a metal - rich system .",
    "these results go in line with our recent findings based on all sub - dlas studied so far being better tracers of the metallicity of the universe because for a given dust - to - gas ratio , there is less  gas and therefore dust in a sub - dla than in a dla .",
    "thus , the obscuration bias will affect the dlas at a lower dust - to - gas ratio as compared to the sub - dlas ( proux et al . ,",
    "the net result is that the observed metallicity of sub - dlas will appear higher than those of classical dlas in a given observed limited magnitude quasar survey .      all the [ fe / h ] measurements presented here are sub - solar ( [ fe / h]@xmath31@xmath61 ) whilst the [ zn / h ] abundances determined are : [ zn / h]=@xmath60.11@xmath70.04 in sdss j0256@xmath110110 at = 0.725 , [ zn / h]=@xmath60.54@xmath70.20 in sdss j1107@xmath110048 at = 0.740 and [ zn / h]=@xmath60.49@xmath70.22 in sdss j2328@xmath110022 at = 0.652 , plus one upper limit ( [ zn / h]@xmath80.36 in sdss j0134@xmath110051 at = 0.842 ) .",
    "the ratio of refractory to volatile elements , such as chromium and zinc respectively , provides an indication of the dust content of quasar absorbers ( e.g. pettini et al .",
    "an increase in the deficiency relative to the solar ratio [",
    "cr / zn]=0 corresponds to an increase in the fraction of chromium depleted from the gas to the dust phase .",
    "here we derive [ cr / zn]=@xmath60.41 in sdss j0256@xmath110110 , [ cr / zn]=@xmath60.25 in sdss j1107@xmath110048 and [ cr / zn]=@xmath60.11 in sdss j2328@xmath110022 .",
    "so most of these systems are above the average estimate of the dust in most quasar absorbers ( see meiring et al .",
    "2006 for a recent compilation ) , which is consistent with their being metal rich .",
    "these results hint once more towards the existence of a population of quasar absorbers having large amounts of dust and high zn abundance ( vladilo & proux , 2005 ) .",
    "there have been suggestions of an obscured fraction of quasar absorbers where the dustier systems would have dimmed their background quasars to the extent than these would not be selected in abundance studies in magnitude - limited samples .",
    "boiss et al .",
    "( 1998 ) empirically determined a so - called `` obscuration threshold '' of [ zn / h]+@xmath32=@xmath32 n(zn ii)@xmath3313.15 in the [ zn / h ] versus @xmath32  parameter space above which no quasar absorbers were observed at the time .",
    "but , there are now three dla systems out of 65 known to lie at @xmath32 n(zn ii)@xmath3313.15 , and of these three dla / sub - dla systems only one deviates by more than 0.15 dex ( sdss j1323@xmath60021 ; proux et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the sample presented here , one additional system ( towards sdss j0256@xmath110110 ) is found to lie slightly above the boiss dust cut - off .",
    "therefore , the `` obscuration threshold '' reported by boiss et al .",
    "( 1998 ) still appears to hold empirically .",
    "it is interesting that the new points do not break the envelope by much , given that other media are known to lie in this region of the [ zn / h ] versus @xmath32  plot , such as gamma ray burst ( grb ) hosts ( see savaglio et al .",
    "2003 , watson et al .",
    "but it might also be that grb hosts , which are evidently warm , high density regions , have strong mg i and therefore overestimates of zn ii , although a curve - of - growth analysis might on the contrary underestimate zn ii .",
    "another mean of assessing the dust content of quasar absorbers is to look at the possible reddening of the background quasar continua . here , we calculate the observed @xmath34 colours of the quasars and derive the excess @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the colour excess based on sloan redshift dependent quasar composite templates ( which removes the effects of redshift in the continuum and lines which affect the colors in a given band ) .",
    "this leads to : @xmath37=@xmath60.041 , 0.081 , 0.078 and @xmath60.137 for sdss j0134@xmath110051 , sdss j0256@xmath110110 , sdss j1107@xmath110048 and sdss j2328@xmath110022 , respectively .",
    "based on figure 3 of york et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , if @xmath37 @xmath330.2 , there is a good chance that the object is reddened , while @xmath37 @xmath380.2 is almost certainly not reddened ( because a random sample shows few objects at those extremes ) . therefore , there is no evidence for very strong reddening due to the absorbers under study in any the four quasars , but the @xmath37 values show that there is not inconsistency with taking the object as reddened .",
    "because  column density estimates at low - redshift require space - based uv spectroscopy , there have been several attempts to find accurate indicators of  from metal lines parameters with large rest - frame wavelengths ( i.e. rao , turnshek & nestor 2006 ) .",
    "more recently , ellison ( 2006 ) has proposed a finer indicator of the presence of dlas via the so - called @xmath39-index , i.e. the ratio of the ( mg ii @xmath40 2796 ) line s ew to velocity spread .",
    "her result shows that at fairly high - resolution  and @xmath39-index correlate , with @xmath39-index@xmath336.3 corresponding to classical dlas .",
    "our present sample adds new data to further constrain the reported correlation : mg ii @xmath40 2796 is covered for three systems ( it falls in a spectral gap for sdss j2328@xmath110022 ) plus an additional sub - dla studied in proux et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . we have measured the following @xmath39-indices for sdss j0134@xmath110051 , sdss j0256@xmath110110 , sdss j2328@xmath110022 and sdss j1323@xmath60021 respectively : @xmath39=5.6 , 6.9 , 8.5 and 7.8 .",
    "these values fall in the right ball - park of the @xmath39-index versus  plot of ellison ( 2006 ) for the sdss j0134@xmath110051 sub - dla and for both the dlas but is off in sdss j1323@xmath60021 case which admittedly is a sub - dla with a large  column density .",
    "therefore our data confirm that the d - index is a good indicator of the presence of dlas among mg ii absorbers .      along the same line of reasoning",
    ", there has been recent renewed interest in the detection of ca ii h and k lines because they might constitute a secure tool with which to detect dlas at low - redshift from medium - resolution optical spectra such as the ones from the sloan survey ( wild & hewett , 2005 ; wild , hewett & pettini , 2006 ) .",
    "these authors report a clear correlation between the strength of the ca ii equivalent width and the amount of reddening in the background quasar spectra .",
    "these findings are surprising given that ca ii is known to be highly depleted onto dust grains and that , therefore , one would expect dusty absorber to have small _ measured _ ca ii abundances .",
    "one way to better understand the relation between observed ca ii and dust would to be study higher - redshift quasar absorbers where the dust content can be estimated with other means ( i.e. cr ii / zn ii ) .",
    "to our knowledge , there are very few measurements of ca ii in quasar absorbers with known n(hi ) at high - redshift . in our sample of high - resolution spectra of @xmath381 quasar absorbers ( proux et al . , 2006 and the present paper )",
    ", only sdss j2328@xmath110022 has the right wavelength coverage to allow ca ii h and k detections .",
    "both @xmath40 3933 and @xmath40 3969 lines are nicely fitted at = 0.652 toward this quasar ( see figure  [ f : q2328_others ] ) and we derive log n(ca ii)=12.43@xmath70.03 ( [ ca / h]@xmath410.78@xmath70.10 ) .",
    "furthermore , we derive [ ca / zn]@xmath410.29 . more systems with a simultaneous measurement of zn ii , cr ii and ca ii lines would help to understand the origin of the trend between reddening and ca ii equivalent width .",
    "we now briefly discuss the implications of our data for the metallicity evolution of dlas .",
    "given that the selection of these systems is based on the presence of strong metal lines , these results represent a ceiling to the global metallicity evolution .",
    "this section is based on dlas only and therefore does not include the sub - dla towards sdss j0134@xmath110051 presented here or the one towards sdss j1323@xmath60021 ( proux et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "the analysis is based on the statistical procedures outlined in kulkarni & fall ( 2002 ) , and uses the data from this paper , the data compiled in kulkarni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , our recent mmt data ( meiring et al .",

    "based on empirical relations , others ( chen et al .",
    "2005 ; zwaan et al .",
    "2005 ) have argued that a combination of metallicity - luminosity relation and metallicity gradients in galaxy discs could produce lower mean metallicity at low redshift , but most models predict that the abundance of dlas at z=0 should be close to solar .    for now , the current samples support the conclusions of khare et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and kulkarni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that the metallicity of the universe traced by dlas evolves slowly at z@xmath383 .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ f : zlowz ] which shows the @xmath43-weighted mean metallicity _ vs. _ look - back time for each of our 6 redshift bins .",
    "the fact that our new systems may be biased ( due to the selection criterion ) towards high metallicity makes the above observations even stronger .",

    "to conclude , we have presented new high - resolution observations of mg i , mg ii , fe ii , zn ii , cr ii , mn ii , ti ii and ca ii towards 3 dlas and 1 sub - dla at 0.6@xmath38@xmath380.9 selected from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "while this small sample is not necessarily representative of the general population given the pre - selection of strong metal lines , it shows that there are high metallicity systems at z@xmath381 .",
