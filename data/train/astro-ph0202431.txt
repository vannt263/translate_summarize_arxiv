    "this test is best for the sources with secular increase or decrease or sudden turn - on or off in the flux , but not good at detecting short - term variations .",
    "none of 28 eligible sources ( @xmath12 30 counts ) are found to have significant variations . from table 2",
    ", we can find that at least 8 sources ( 24 , 32 , 48 - 50 , 59 - 61 ) have intrinsic absorption .",
    "the estimated column densities are from 10@xmath37 to at least 10@xmath51 @xmath10 .",
    "cappi et al . ( 2001 ) found source excesses at levels of @xmath1 2 @xmath2 around two z@xmath10.5 galaxy clusters 3c 295 and rxj 003033.2 + 261819 .",
    "we did a similar analysis for the central field of a1367 .",
    "we chose the central 8.@xmath173 square field centered at the aimpoint ( a chip size , see fig .",
    "2 ) , where the sensitivity is the highest , to examine the log n - log s relation in the soft band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and hard band ( 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "the point sources with known origins ( associated with member galaxies here ) were excluded in computing the log n - log s. a power law model ( @xmath43=1.7 ) with the galactic absorption is assumed for the sources .",
    "the conversion factors are 3.1@xmath810@xmath13 ergs @xmath10 s@xmath5 for 1 c / ks in the 0.5 - 2 kev , and 2.4@xmath810@xmath14 ergs @xmath10 s@xmath5 for 1 c / ks in the 2 - 10 kev .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the source numbers observed are over 2 times that predicted by the log n - log s relations found in the deep fields in both soft and hard bands ( hasinger et al .",
    "1998 ; mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ; giacconi et al .",
    "2001 ; tozzi et al .",
    "2001 ; brandt et al .",
    "the k - s tests show that the observed log n - log s relations and any known ones from deep surveys are quite different ( @xmath12 0.95 ) . in the soft band ,",
    "when we move the observed log n - log s relations from the deep surveys up to @xmath1 2.5 @xmath2 levels , they begin to be consistent with the observed one .",
    "the largest difference is at flux larger than 2@xmath810@xmath13 ergs @xmath10 s@xmath5 .",
    "we observe 20 sources with fluxes larger than that value , while the log n - log s relations from the deep surveys predict 7 - 10 sources .",
    "thus , in the soft band , there is a source excess at a level of @xmath1 2.5 @xmath2 .",
    "similarly in the hard band , we detect 16 sources with flux larger than 8@xmath810@xmath13 ergs @xmath10 , while the log n - log s relations from the deep surveys predict @xmath1 6 sources .",
    "thus , in the hard band , there is also a source excess at a level of @xmath1 2.5 @xmath2 .",
    "the source excess observed in a1367 seems similar to what cappi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found .",
    "however , in the case of a1367 , since it is much closer than the two z@xmath10.5 clusters , any galaxies with b less than @xmath1 20@xmath52 should be clearly revealed in dss ii blue image .",
    "thus , if the excess sources are related to a1367 , then they must be very optically faint ( log(l@xmath53/l@xmath54 ) @xmath18 8.5 ) . in the sources",
    "used to derive the soft band log n - log s relation in the central field , the faintest and the brightest sources have x - ray luminosities of 3@xmath810@xmath15 ergs s@xmath5 ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and 2.5@xmath810@xmath26 ergs s@xmath5 ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) respectively if they are physically located in a1367 .",
    "for the brightest nine sources in the central field , we have fitted their spectra simply by power law models .",
    "the derived photon indices are generally consistent with those of agn ( @xmath1 1.7 ; table 2 ) .",
    "thus , if the excess is due to the sources in a1367 , they have to be llagns with low optical luminosities ( log(l@xmath53/l@xmath54 ) @xmath18 8.5 ) or even ulxs .",
    "optical identification of all the sources seen in the a1367 field is needed to resolve the difference between the expected excess and that observed .",
    "we have reported results from the most complete flux limited sample of x - ray sources in this part of a1367 .",
    "ten of twenty - five known member galaxies ( log(l@xmath53/l@xmath54 ) @xmath0 9.5 ) in the  field were detected .",
    "thermal halo , x - ray binary and nuclear components are all observed in their spectra .",
    "eight of ten galaxies are point - like sources in this observation and are discussed in the paper .",
    "the radio galaxy 3c 264 ( ngc 3862 ) is found to have a bl lac - like x - ray spectrum ( @xmath43=2.44@xmath190.05 in the 0.7 - 9 kev ; @xmath43=2.72@xmath22 in the 2 - 9 kev ) .",
    "this observation further discovered 2 new agn / llagn ( ngc 3861  absorbed and ngc 3860 ) and 2 candidates of agn / llagn ( cgcg 097 - 109 and cgcg 097 - 113 ) , showing that the x - ray observation serves as a powerful way to detect agn , especially llagns since they usually have weak optical emission lines .",
    "it is known that agns are rare in the nearby ( z @xmath55 0.1 ) cluster of galaxies ( @xmath1 1% by dressler , thompson & shectman 1985 ; may be less by way , flores & quintana 1998 ) .",
    "there are 25 known member galaxies in the field ( from ned ) .",
    "thus , the observed percentage of agn / llagn in this field ( @xmath0 12% ) is much higher than that found by dressler et al .",
    "however , the limited statistics here make any further discussion impossible at this time .    for early type galaxies , the x - ray luminosities of thermal halos",
    "are correlated with the optical luminosities l@xmath53 , though dispersion is large ( e.g. , canizares , fabbiano & trinchieri 1987 ; brown & bregman 1998 ) .",
    "two early type galaxies ( ngc 3842 and ngc 3837 ) were discovered to have soft thermal components , which are explained as thermal halos .",
    "they follow the predicted l@xmath44 - l@xmath53 correlation ( e.g. , brown & bregman 1998 ) . moreover , we estimated the upper limits of x - ray luminosities of those early type galaxies without detection in the field ( table 1 ) .",
    "the derived upper limits are also consistent with the known l@xmath44 - l@xmath53 correlation .",
    "the discovery of the thermal halos in elliptical galaxies ngc 3842 and ngc 3837 ( t @xmath1 0.5 - 0.8 kev ) , in combination with the discovery of an extended feature associated with ngc 3860 ( t @xmath1 0.5 - 0.9 kev ; discussed in paper i ) , demonstrate that galactic coronae can survive in the cluster environment ( e.g. , vikhlinin et .",
    "al 2001 ) .",
    "although we do not know the exact positions of these galaxies along the lines of sight , the fact that ngc 3842 is the cd galaxy of a galaxy concentration suggests that it should be located close to the bottom of the potential well . using the @xmath56-model fit to the nw subcluster by donnelly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we derive an icm density of @xmath1 5 @xmath8 10@xmath57 cm @xmath58 surrounding ngc 3842 .",
    "the icm surrounding ngc 3842 has a temperature of @xmath1 4.5 kev ( see fig . 6 in paper i ) .",
    "thus , the evaporation time - scale is @xmath1 10@xmath59 yr ( no matter classical or saturated evaporation ; cowie & mckee 1977 ) .",
    "however , the radiative cooling time - scale  3m@xmath60kt/2@xmath61m@xmath62l@xmath44  is 2.3@xmath810@xmath63 yr for ngc 3842 .",
    "thus , heat conduction at the boundary of ngc 3842 must be suppressed to a factor of @xmath1 20 for the survival of its thermal halo .",
    "this provides an additional evidence for the suppression of heat conductivity in the icm after the  discovery of thermal halos in the two dominant galaxies of coma ( vikhlinin et .",
    "al 2001 ) .",
    "a tangled magnetic field is one possible reason for such suppression ( e.g. fabian 1994 ) .",
    "when we gather more cases of suppressed heat conduction in icm , the physics behind this phenomenon will be better understood .",
