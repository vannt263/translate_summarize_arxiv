    "these clumpy systems are expected to coalesce and form a spheroid while a surrounding disk may grow through the continued accretion of gas @xcite .",
    "individual clumps could in some cases be the nuclei of star - forming objects that are merging together , or they could be giant starburst regions inside a larger gaseous system induced by merging or a plentiful smooth or `` lumpy '' gas supply .",

    "however , it is important to keep in mind that the properties of galaxies in the local universe are generally very different from those at high redshift , making it hard to disentangle actual physical differences from observational biases . to better facilitate the straight comparison , the `` lyman break analogs '' ( lba ) project",
    "was designed in order to search for local starburst galaxies that share typical characteristics of high redshift lbgs @xcite . in brief , the uv imaging survey performed by the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) was used in order to select the most luminous ( @xmath13 @xmath14 ) and most compact ( @xmath15 @xmath14 kpc@xmath16 ) star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "although such galaxies are very rare , they tend to be much more luminous in the uv than typical local starburst galaxies studied previously @xcite consistent with high sfrs and relatively little dust extinction .",

    "one of the advantages of lbas being so bright in the rest - frame uv is that their morphologies can be easily compared with typical galaxies at high redshift without having to artifically brighten them as was done in previous studies @xcite . in @xcite ( paper i )",
    "we analyzed the uv morphologies of a small sample of 8 lbas observed with hst , finding that most of the uv emission in the lbas originates in highly compact burst regions in small , clumpy galaxies that appear morphologically similar to lbgs .",
    "we argued that if lbgs at high redshift are also small merging galaxies similar to the lbas , this would be very hard to detect given the much poorer physical resolution and sensitivity . in this paper , we present an analysis of the morphologies of our full data set consisting of rest - frame uv and optical hst images of 30 lbas and compare with star - forming galaxies at @xmath21 in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) .",

    "the comparison data consist of three samples of star - forming galaxies at @xmath3 , @xmath19 and @xmath33 .",

    "nonetheless , after we have applied an additional cut on uv luminosity ( see below ) , it is expected that these samples are very similar to the typical uv - selected lbg samples referred to in literature as @xmath38-dropouts ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath39-dropouts ( @xmath33 ) . at @xmath3 ,",
    "analogous selections can be made based on the @xmath40 colors of starbursts that are typically referred to as bm / bx samples .",
    "because deep @xmath38 and @xmath6-band data were not available to us for the hudf , we have instead used a sample of galaxies selected according to @xmath41 from @xcite .",
    "this criterion selects star - forming galaxies ( `` s@xmath2 '' galaxies ) with photometric redshifts in the range @xmath42 @xcite , and it has been shown that there is a high degree of overlap between the uv - selected `` bm / bx '' galaxies and the @xmath43-selected s@xmath2 galaxies , particularly at faint ( @xmath44 ) magnitudes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we will remedy these shortcomings as follows . in the minority of cases",
    "where our available uv data is somewhat bluer or redder than the mean rest - frame wavelenghts of the high redshift data , we will assume that the morphological @xmath43-corrections from rest - frame fuv to nuv/@xmath38 are negligible .",

    "first , galaxies may contain unresolved components containing more than 20% of the light , thereby causing @xmath101 to be overestimated and @xmath7 to be underestimated .",
    "second , a small offset between the estimated center of a galaxy and a highly concentrated nucleus will also cause @xmath7 to be underestimated compared to its true value .",
    "because both effects can only be countered effectively for the redshifted lba sample ( for which sub - resolution and sub - sensitivity spatial information is available ) but not for the real high redshift samples , we have not attempted to correct for these effects .",
    "the gini coefficient is known to correlate with @xmath7 , but differs in the sense that it is sensitive to any concentrated light independent of its spatial distribution @xcite .",
    "similar to @xmath7 and @xmath6 , the @xmath9 parameter is also sensitive to concentrated light . however , because every pixel is multiplied by the square of its distance relative to the centre ( a free parameter ) , it is more sensitive to spatial fluctuations such as bright clumps or double nuclei from merging systems ( high @xmath9 ) .",

    "the drop in the median values can be explained due to a combination of the loss in resolution and sensitivity .",
    "the loss of faint structures causes the 80% light radius to be underestimated ( lowering @xmath7 ) and the flux to be more evenly distributed over the detected pixels ( lowering @xmath6 ) .",

    "the statistical results are consistent with our qualitative conclusions summarized above .",

    "although we currently do not know the relative contribution from major and minor mergers , the diversity in lba morphologies at least suggests a range in merger conditions and stages albeit that they all have in common that their starbursts are all very young ( ages of a few tens of myr ) , compact and uv - luminous @xcite .",
    "we have shown that , both in the uv and optical , asymmetry appears to be a better indicator for this merger activity than @xmath9 .",
    "the median @xmath8 is larger than the merger criterion of @xmath118 from @xcite , while the median @xmath9 is much lower than the merger criterion of @xmath106 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we redshifted the lbas to @xmath119 and found a significant drop in the uv asymmetries such that the median @xmath8 fell well below the merger criterion . in the optical ,",
    "the drop was smaller and less significant .",
    "@xmath9 became even smaller as the different star - forming clumps blended into single light concentrations at high redshift .",
    "we thus conclude that if galaxies similar to lbas were observed in the uv at high redshift , all but a few would be mistaken as being relatively smooth and symmetric rather than identified as mergers . in the optical",
    ", we estimate that @xmath1050% would be identified as symmetric .",
    "@xcite investigated in detail the complicated relation between the ability to morphologically classify merging galaxies on one hand , and the physical details of the merger on the other . as expected , the merger observability time - scale ( i.e. , the time during which a merger is identified as such compared to the total merging time ) critically depends on , e.g. , orbital parameters , gas fraction , dust , sn feedback , and viewing angle .",
    "these results explain , for example , why the @xmath120 system is much more effective in identifying the roughly two - thirds of local ulirgs having more than one nuclei that are seen either just prior to final coalescence or in projection at first passage , than single nucleus ulirgs @xcite . in a similar fashion , this `` merger observability '' as defined by @xcite can also explain why a significant fraction of the lbas do not appear to be particularly disturbed for some or all of the morphological parameters .",
    "however , in addition to these effects , our simple simulations clearly show that for lba - like galaxies observed at high redshift the decreased physical resolution and sensitivity are of equal or even greater importance than the physical details of the merger .",
    "the median @xmath9 of lbgs at @xmath4 is larger than that of lbas , while the @xmath8 is similar .",
    "the fractions of lbgs classified as disturbed based on either one of these parameters in the uv is @xmath1030% , consistent with previous works @xcite . in the optical , a similar result",
    "is obtained based on @xmath8 , while a much smaller fraction is derived based on @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the differences observed between @xmath2 galaxies and lbas are much more significant than those between lbgs and lbas : in the uv , @xmath2s have the highest @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the lowest @xmath7 and @xmath6 of all samples considered here . in the optical , @xmath2s had the largest median half - light radii",
    ".    it must be noted , however , that our way of selecting lbas based on a uv surface brightness criterion was tuned to select objects having similar uv luminosities and sizes as typical lbgs at @xmath19 @xcite . in principle , the lba selection could be expanded or modified to search for such objects more similar to @xmath2 galaxies , but one must be more careful as such a selection would include a wider variety of galaxies that are not so suitable analogs of high redshift objects compared to lbas @xcite .",
    "an example of a particularly clumpy lba is the luminous blue compact dwarf galaxy haro 11 at @xmath121 @xcite , which lies close to the edge of our lba selection criteria based on fuv luminosity and surface brightness @xcite .",
    "it is similar to the lbas in most aspects but with a relatively high degree of clumpiness due to three strong light concentrations in an otherwise amorphous , forming galaxy .",
    "its uv morphology at high redshift is similar to that of double nucleated galaxies identified on the basis of a large @xmath9 or even a `` by eye '' classification @xcite .",
    "based on the results presented in the previous sections , we can now make a series of statements purely based on the comparison of the morphologies of lbas and high redshift starbursts ( such as bzks and lbgs ) : + 1 .",
    "lbas show clumpy star formation .",
    "our redshift simulations suggest that real high redshift samples have a similar ( lbgs ; @xmath4 ) or perhaps a slightly stronger ( @xmath2s ; @xmath3 ) degree of clumpy star formation .",
    "lbas show luminous uv clumps and faint optical tidal features that , in the majority of cases , are interpreted by us as being due to mergers based on the visual evidence .",
    "our simulations suggest that this information can not be recovered from the rest - frame uv morphological parameters at high redshift , while in the rest - frame optical perhaps 1 out of every 2 objects would be classified as disturbed .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that current estimates for the fraction of galaxies at high redshift having disturbed morphologies ( as opposed to smooth / symmetric morphologies ) is most likely a ( weak ) lower limit on the true fraction .",
    "this statement is independent of the physical mechanism that is the cause of these disturbed morphologies .",
    "the observations suggest a scenario where either cold gas accretion and internal instabilities can drive clumpy star formation in lbgs at levels higher than any seen in lbas in the local universe , or where clumpy cold accretion , possibly at the level of major or minor mergers may be responsible for star formation in lbas and lbgs alike .",
    "we will discuss these possibilities in more detail below .",
    "+ the latest observational evidence suggests that the fraction of lbgs at @xmath4 having disturbed or distorted morphologies is @xmath1030% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* this paper ) .",
    "although these disturbances do not necessarily need to be explained by galaxy mergers , it does suggest that bulk material is coming in , perhaps in the form of giant gas clouds or minor mergers .",
    "@xcite find that the fraction of @xmath33 @xmath39-dropouts forming a pair with another @xmath39-dropout is very similar to the fraction of disturbed morphologies : @xmath1020% within a 20 h@xmath27 kpc projected radius .",
    "interpreting the similarity in the pair counts and morphologies as evidence for merging , they estimate that a @xmath122 @xmath123 galaxy will undergo a major merger every 12 gyr at @xmath4 .",
    "similar high merger rates were obtained for @xmath124 , possibly with an increase towards the most massive and most luminous galaxies @xcite . with such high inferred merger rates , the mass growth of lbgs due to",
    "these mergers could make a significant contribution to the mass growth at @xmath19 compared to that due to star formation fueled by a more continuous gas accretion and sustained over a period of a gyr at a rate of @xmath125 @xmath123 yr@xmath27 .",
    "perhaps these two channels of formation are not contradictory given that the high density environments of lbgs are likely to be simultaneously associated with both frequent mergers of small galaxies and rapid cold accretion ( likely with some level of lumpiness ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the remaining 7080% of lbgs , that appear as relatively smooth / symmetric and are forming stars at a similarly high rate as the disturbed objects , could be the result from rapid gas collapse , provided that a sufficiently long amount of time ( @xmath1260.5 gyr ) has passed since their last major merger otherwise this would have been apparent in their morphology given the high ( inferred ) merger rates .",
    "however , our new results based on lbas present an important caveat to this interpretation : we have shown that , at least for galaxies at high redshift similar to lbas , in the majority of cases we are not able to detect significant disturbances or asymmetries to their morphologies ( mostly because of redshift effects , and not because they are not there ) .",
    "this allows for the possibility that the fraction of galaxies at high redshift that is undergoing interactions could be much higher than currently inferred from the observations .",
    "alternatively , less violent accretion processes coupled with large disk instabilities at high redshift are capable of triggering starbursts at levels only seen in low redshift , merger - induced samples such as the lbas .",
    "future deep , high resolution observations of rest - frame optical morphologies and kinematics ( see below ) , together with constraints on the lbg pair fractions and small - scale clustering @xcite will perhaps allow us to distinguish between these scenarios .      in recent years , the study of high redshift lbgs has advanced considerably beyond studies that are based purely on morphology .",
    "mainly through the use of integral field spectrographs in the near - infrared it has become feasible to determine the basic kinematical properties of the emission line gas as well .",
    "motivated by the high degree of similarity in the properties of our locally selected uv - luminous galaxies and those at high redshift , it is a useful exercise to compare the gas kinematics of lbas and lbgs . in a first study published by @xcite , the bright pa-@xmath98 emission line was used to study the resolved gas dynamics in 3 of our lbas . in two cases ,",
    "a mild velocity gradient was found , but in all three cases the kinematics were dominated by the dispersion rather than structured rotation ( @xmath127 ) . simulating the data at @xmath3 demonstrated that the ( gas ) kinematical properties of these objects are similar to the kinematical profiles commonly seen at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argued that neither the self - gravity of disks fueled by gas accretion flows nor the internal velocity dispersions of massive star - forming clumps can fully explain the high velocity dispersions observed at high redshift .",
    "furthermore , the most massive of clumps observed possibly would not have been formed at all if the gas turbulence in the disk was not high enough to begin with @xcite , while mergers alone may not be sufficient to explain those objects dominated by a large number of massive clumps in so - called `` clump - cluster '' or `` chain galaxy '' configurations at high redshift @xcite . instead , @xcite suggest that the kinematic properties of the ism in starburst galaxies is affected by the mechanical energy input resulting from massive star formation . in this scenario ,",
    "the starbursts that are associated with each of the clumps drive blast waves from supernovae ( sn ) and stellar winds that appear sufficient to give rise to the high gas pressures and high velocity dispersions observed .",
    "as shown in @xcite , some lbas show very high pressures and clear evidence for an ism that is dominated by starburst- and sn - feedback associated with massive star - forming clumps , consistent with such a scenario . if this is correct , then estimates for the merger rates at high redshift estimated from pair counts or morphologies are perhaps less biased than those obtained from the ( ionized ) gas kinematics because the latter may not always trace galaxy interactions , if present , very well .",
    "in addition , @xcite have shown with simulations that at least some merging systems would still be classified as `` disks '' using the methodology applied to observations at @xmath3 by @xcite .",
    "the simulations of @xcite also show how some of the main structural , spectral and chemical properties of certain @xmath2 galaxies can be explained in the context of gas - rich mergers as well , eventhough it has been claimed that such systems can not be merger remnants .",

    "<S> previous work has shown that lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) display a range in structures ( from single and compact to more clumpy and extended ) that is different from typical local star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we have introduced a sample of rare , nearby ( @xmath0 ) starburst galaxies that appear to be good analogs of lbgs . </S>",
    "<S> these `` lyman break analogs '' ( lbas ) provide an excellent training set for understanding starbursts at different redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we present an application of this by comparing the rest - frame uv and optical morphologies of 30 lbas with those of galaxies at @xmath1 in the hubble ultra deep field . </S>",
    "<S> we compare lbas with star - forming s@xmath2 galaxies at @xmath3 , and lbgs at @xmath4 at the same intrinsic uv luminosity ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the uv / optical colors and sizes of lbas and lbgs are very similar , while the @xmath2 galaxies are somewhat redder and larger . </S>",
    "<S> lbas lie along a mass - metallicity relation that is offset from that of typical local galaxies , but similar to that seen at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> there is significant overlap between the morphologies ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) of the local and high redshift samples , although the high redshift samples are somewhat less concentrated and clumpier than the lbas . </S>",
    "<S> based on their highly asymmetric morphologies , we find that in the majority of lbas the starbursts appear to be triggered by interactions / mergers . </S>",
    "<S> when the images of the lbas are degraded to the same sensitivity and linear resolution as the images of lbgs and bzk galaxies , we find that these relatively faint asymmetric features are no longer detectable . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is particularly severe in the rest - frame ultraviolet . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that high redshift galaxies experience intense bursts unlike anything seen in the local universe , possibly due to cold flows and instabilities . in part , this is based on the fact that the majority ( @xmath1070% ) of lbgs do not show morphological signatures of interactions or mergers . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that this evidence is insufficient , since a large fraction of such signatures would likely have been missed in current observations of galaxies at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves open the possibility that clumpy accretion and mergers remain important in driving the evolution of these starbursts , together with rapid gas accretion through other means . </S>"
