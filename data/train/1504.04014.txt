    "artificially - prepared honeycomb lattices offer insight into parameter ranges that are out of reach for natural graphene , suggesting new directions in which to push experimental investigations in materials science  @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of such artificial graphene is that the tunnelling of particles between different lattice sites can be controlled in an independent and flexible way .",
    "a beautiful result from the theory of electron motion in honeycomb lattices is that the effect of an elastic deformation of the material , e.g. as induced by a mechanical strain , can be described in terms of an artificial valley - dependent magnetic field acting on the electrons .",
    "this effect was first predicted in carbon nanotubes  @xcite and soon extended to two - dimensional graphene  @xcite .",
    "a suitably designed strain can generate a constant magnetic field such that the electronic spectrum exhibits quantized landau levels , as experimentally observed in graphene nanobubbles  @xcite . as a consequence of the underlying dirac dispersion of the electron band structure ,",
    "the spacing of the landau levels follows a square - root law starting from zero energy for both positive and negative energies , with the sign of the artificial magnetic field opposite for electrons in the vicinity of the two inequivalent dirac points .    in the photonic context , this physics was first experimentally investigated in  @xcite using a distorted lattice of optical waveguides : the lattice deformation modulated the hopping amplitude between neighbouring waveguides , which in turn generated an artificial pseudo - magnetic field for photons .",
    "given the propagating nature of the optical set - up , evidence of the landau levels could only be obtained in an indirect way from the localized edge modes , which reside in the energy - gaps between the landau levels . in this experiment , it was not possible to obtain detailed information on the microscopic structure of the landau levels themselves .    in this paper , we propose an alternative photonic set - up consisting of an array of cavities with a honeycomb geometry , as inspired by the experiments of  @xcite and  @xcite : the former used a laterally patterned semiconductor microcavity device for infra - red light , while the latter were based on an array of coupled dielectric cylindrical resonators sandwiched between metallic plates .",
    "in contrast to the propagating waveguide set - up of  @xcite , such cavity arrays are intrinsically driven - dissipative systems , which allow the use of spectroscopic techniques to characterize their eigenstates .",
    "in fact , a general result  @xcite is that the different eigenmodes of a driven - dissipative system naturally appear as peaks in the transmission / absorption spectra under a coherent incident field .",
    "when the pump frequency is set on resonance with a given mode spectrally isolated from its neighbours , the intensity profiles in both real- and momentum - space faithfully reproduce the mode wavefunction  @xcite .    here",
    "we show how this general spectroscopic technique can be applied to the case of a honeycomb lattice to investigate the landau levels appearing in the presence of distortion . instead of a complex trigonal distortion of the lattice ,",
    "as considered , for example , in  @xcite , we consider a simpler geometry with a single hopping amplitude that is linearly varied  @xcite . even though this configuration is hard to realise by mechanically straining a real graphene sample , for the sake of simplicity we shall refer to it as the _ strained _ honeycomb lattice .",

    "strain is mechanically generated by applying suitably designed external forces to the sample , so that atoms are physically pushed closer together or pulled further apart in a spatially - dependent way .",
    "this results in a corresponding modulation of both the sample geometry and the hopping amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "typical geometries used in graphene experiments involve graphene nanobubbles  @xcite or trigonal deformations of the honeycomb lattice  @xcite .",
    "such trigonal deformations were implemented in the photonic context in the coupled waveguide experiment of  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we take advantage of the wider design flexibility of artificial graphene to show how much simpler geometries with a unidirectional hopping gradient can be used to generate an artificial magnetic field .    to understand how a magnetic field naturally appears in a strained honeycomb lattice , one can follow the available literature  @xcite and make use of an extended tight - binding model with a suitably designed spatial dependence of the hopping amplitudes @xmath25 on the site indices @xmath7 .    as a first step , we consider constant , spatially independent @xmath26 .",

    "moreover , this imaginary part can be understood as off - diagonal components in the dirac velocity recast in a tensorial form  @xcite .    in order to have a non - zero artificial magnetic field",
    ", one must allow for a spatial dependence of the hopping elements @xmath25 on the site indices @xmath7 , as sketched in fig.[fig : graphene ] : the position of the ( local ) dirac points in @xmath41 space then varies along the lattice in real space , following the spatial dependence of the artificial vector potential @xmath42 . the artificial magnetic field @xmath5 ( directed along the @xmath45 direction )",

    "[ fig : graphene ] . along @xmath0",
    ", the ribbon is terminated on both ends with bearded edges .",
    "we assume that the hopping @xmath49 is positive and has the following spatial dependence : @xmath50 with a gradient oriented in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "the positive dimensionless parameter @xmath51 quantifies the intensity of the spatially inhomogeneous strain and the positions @xmath52 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath53 hoppings in the other two directions are spatially uniform and equal @xmath54 .",
    "we choose the hopping in the middle of the ribbon to be @xmath55 . as we require the hoppings to have the same sign at all positions along @xmath0 , the condition @xmath56 at one edge imposes an upper bound on the strain , @xmath57 this condition automatically implies that @xmath58 at the other edge , which guarantees ( within a local band picture ) that no local lifshitz transition to a gapped state  @xcite takes place in the considered ribbon .",
    "the form of the strain in eq .   leads to a vector potential @xmath42 in the landau gauge with a constant valley - dependent pseudo - magnetic field @xmath59 of strength : @xmath60 the corresponding magnetic length is : @xmath61 inserting the values of the electron charge and the lattice spacing of real graphene , the field in eq .",

    "the procedure to diagonalize the hamiltonian is closely analogous to the usual one for charged massive particles in a uniform magnetic field in free space  @xcite . at the lowest order in @xmath31 and @xmath0",
    ", we can express the spatial dependence of the hopping amplitudes in terms of a position operator @xmath68 and the off - diagonal matrix element in eq .",

    "all the discussion so far neglects the dependence of the dirac velocity on the hopping amplitudes in eq .  .",
    "the first correction to the relativistic landau levels in eq",

    "their energies are in good agreement with the analytical prediction of eq .  , including the corrections due to the spatial dependence of the dirac velocity @xmath64 .",
    "the slight discrepancies that are visible to a careful eye can be explained by the approximations in our analytical calculations , e.g. the neglect of higher - order terms in the expansion .",
    "as expected , the agreement between the analytical model and the full numerics gets better for smaller values of the strain parameter @xmath51 : in this regime , the magnetic length extends for a larger number of sites ( proportional to @xmath117 ) and the @xmath41-space wavefunction gets more localized in the vicinity of the dirac point .",
    "this makes the continuum approximation underlying the analytical model more and more accurate . at the same time , the characteristic value of the vector potential @xmath42 within the real - space wavefunction decreases as @xmath118 , thus reducing the importance of the corrections to the isotropic conical dirac dispersion .",
