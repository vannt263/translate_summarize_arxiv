    "the influence of internal factors and environment on galaxy evolution has been the subject of detailed studies in recent years ( blanton et al .",
    "2005 , van der wel 2008 , hoyle et al .",
    "2012 , etc ) . from these studies",
    "it has become apparent that the process leading to the evolution of a galaxy from one morphological type to another are similar in all environments , but they are more intensive in dense regions ( see review by blanton & moustakas 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "the results from correlation studies between the main galaxy parameters such as colour , stellar mass and morphology have shown that the environmental dependence on colour is stronger than for morphology ( bamford et al .",
    "deng et al .",
    "( 2012 ) concluded that galaxy colour depends more on environment than galaxy luminosity .    to study the influence of the environment on galaxy properties ( such as colours , morphology , luminosity etc .",
    ") , it is necessary to have reference samples .",
    "the authors of environmental studies ( see references below ) used the various kinds of reference samples which could be roughly grouped into three categories : ( i ) the galaxies from all environments ( see for example blanton et al .",
    "2005 , van der wel 2008 ) ; ( ii ) the galaxies in the void regions ( rojas et al .",

    "note that in certain cases the control sample consists of galaxies which have similar properties to the investigated sample ( e.g. , patton et al .",
    "2011 ) .    by definition ,",
    "the isolated galaxies are objects that have not been appreciably affected by their closest neighbours over the past few gyr so their properties are mainly driven by intrinsic evolution and not by the external influence of their environment ( see karachentseva 1980 , verley et al .",
    "2007 , karachentseva et al . 2010 and references therein ) . unlike `` field '' or `` non - clustered '' galaxies , which are simply objects located outside of groups and clusters ( de vaucouleurs 1971 , turner & gott 1977 , makarov & karachentsev 2011 , karachentsev et al . 2012 ) , the isolated galaxies are the objects selected using a special `` isolation '' criterion ( examples of the different approaches can be found in the works by karachentseva 1973 , varela et al .",

    "recently , fernandez lorenzo et al . (",
    "2012 ) considered the colour properties of kigs and showed that the isolated spiral galaxies are redder than objects in close pairs .",
    "at the same time the authors did not find clear differences between the colours of isolated galaxies and galaxies in group / field environments .",
    "moreover , isolated and non - isolated early type galaxies showed a similar @xmath7 .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to consider the colour properties of the 2mass isolated galaxies ( 2mig ; karachentseva et al .",
    "2010 ) in comparison with galaxies in other i.e. denser ( field , pair , group / cluster ) environments . in section 2 we present the sample of 2mig galaxies and the selection criteria . in section 3",
    "we compare the colours of 2mig galaxies which have faint companions and without them .",
    "we also compare the 2mig colours with those of control samples randomly selected from the field , groups and clusters .",
    "the results of a colour comparison between the 2mig galaxies and those in group / cluster and pair / triplet environments is given in section 4 .",

    "the 2mig entire sky catalogue of isolated galaxies ( karachentseva et al .",
    "2010 ) was selected from 1.6 million objects of the two micron all - sky survey extended source catalog ( 2mass xsc ; jarrett et al .",
    "selection of objects was performed twice : ( i ) automatically according to the original criteria of isolation by karachentseva ( 1973 ) adapted to the 2mass data :    @xmath8    and    @xmath9    where subscripts `` 1 '' and",
    "`` i '' refer to the fixed galaxy and its neighbours , respectively . according to these criteria",
    ", a galaxy with a standard angular diameter @xmath10 is considered isolated if its angular separation @xmath11 from all its neighbours with `` significant '' angular diameters @xmath12 inside interval ( 2 ) is equal to or exceeds 30@xmath13 .",
    "\\(ii ) visual inspecting of the images ( dss1,2 and sdss ) of all isolated candidates to identify visible neighbours .",
    "visual inspection allowed us to eliminate physically multiple systems with blue neighbours which were missed in the automatic selection ( see details in karachentseva et al .",
    "2010 ) . finally , the 2mig catalogue consists of 3227 galaxies brighter than @xmath14 = 12 mag and with angular diameters @xmath15 30@xmath16 . in total",
    "we found approximately 6% of isolated galaxies among the extended sources of 2mass xsc survey .",

    "( 2011 ) considered the statistical relations between different observational characteristics , and kudrya & karachentseva ( 2012 ) constructed the tully - fisher relations for the 2mig galaxies .",
    "coziol et al .",
    "( 2011 ) made an extensive analysis of agn impact in the 2mig sample , and anderson et al .",
    "( 2013 ) considered the x - ray properties of 2migs with rosat data .",
    "we have updated the data about the radial velocities of the 2mig galaxies using the ned and hyperleda ( paturel et al .",
    "2003 ) databases .",
    "this has led to an increase in the number of known velocities from 2328 to 2573 . in the current paper",
    "we consider only those objects with @xmath17500 km / s .",
    "we have also revised the morphological types of galaxies according to the sdss images and to the types given by coziol et al .",
    "the authors of the latter paper took into account not only the visually defined types of 2migs but also their star formation history based on spectra analysis .",
    "this led to a further 232 galaxies in the 2mig sample having new morphological types . in this paper , like in karachentseva et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , we have adopted the scale : -2  e , 0  s0 , 1  s0/a , 2  sab , 3  sb , 4  sbc , 5  sc , 6  scd , 7  sd , 8  sdm , 9  i m , 10  ir .     magnitude distribution for 2mig ( n=2541 ) and 2mig - sdss ( n=912 ) galaxies.,width=321 ]            in this work we have consider two galaxy samples : the 2mig and 2mig - sdss galaxies having 2mass and sdss magnitudes , respectively .",

    "these companions are not satisfied the condition ( 2 ) , i.e. their diameters are too small in comparison with 2migs . however karachentseva et al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed that these companions have little effect on the dynamic isolation of the 2mig galaxies .    in table 1",
    "we compared the medians of ( @xmath41)@xmath42 and ( @xmath7)@xmath42 rest - frame colour indices according to formula ( 3 ) of 2mig galaxies which have faint companions ( 2mig@xmath43 ) and which do not have them ( 2mig@xmath44 ) .",

    "3 ) . table 2 represents the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) probabilities that pairs of the samples are derived from the same parent population .",
    "we did not compare l type galaxies separately because of their paucity n=4 ( 3% ) in 2mig@xmath43 sample .",
    "the part of l type galaxies in whole considered 2mig sample is near 11% but it is not surprising that the earlier type galaxies tend to have more companions than the later types .",
    "the median values of the absolute magnitudes @xmath45 of 2mig@xmath43 and 2mig@xmath44 are -22.18@xmath46 and -21.98@xmath47 , respectively , which indicates that isolated galaxies with faint companions are in general more massive than those without any neighbours , i.e. we see luminosity vs. morphology relation .",
    "the significance of the difference is confirmed by the ks probability given in table 2 . however",
    "if we consider e and m types separately , we do not see any significant difference in the magnitudes : -22.26@xmath48 and -22.18@xmath49 for e and m types of 2mig@xmath43 sample , and -22.26@xmath50 and -21.98@xmath51 of 2mig@xmath44 sample , respectively .    considering tables 1 and 2 we conclude that e type galaxies with and without companions have completely same colours .",

    "for all three e , m and l types we observe the same tendency : with decreasing the distance between galaxies the median value of the colour indices increasing forming a peak on cp1 sample and then , again , the median colour index is decreasing with minimum on the kp+kt sample .",
    "meanwhile we know from table 4 that the difference between @xmath1 colours of e - type galaxies is significant only for the 2mig and cp1 samples ( the latter sample is redder ) . here",

    "<S> we made detailed comparisons between the near - infrared ( 2mass ) and optical ( sdss ) colours of the 2mass xsc selected sample of isolated 2mig galaxies and with other objects from the wide range of denser environments ( field , groups / clusters , triplets and pairs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that early type galaxies show similar @xmath0 and @xmath1 colours practically in all types of environments . </S>",
    "<S> exception is for the massive early type galaxies located in compact pairs with high velocity difference ( @xmath2180 km / s ) , which are significantly redder and brighter than isolated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that these pairs are located in the centres of more populated groups and clusters . </S>",
    "<S> in general , galaxies in groups and pairs of spiral and late morphological types have redder near - infrared colours @xmath0 than 2mig isolated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 colours of galaxies in groups and pairs with high velocity difference are also significantly redder than corresponding colours of 2mig galaxies . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the members of most compact pairs ( @xmath250 km / s , @xmath330 kpc ) show the same @xmath1 colour and even tend to be bluer than 2mig galaxies . in summary , </S>",
