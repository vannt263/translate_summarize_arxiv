    "several experiments on cooling two spin - polarized states of a fermi gas have proven that this setup is an important tool for investigating the collisional properties of such a quantum system @xcite .",
    "the jila group has recently performed experiments in which the collisionality of a @xmath0k mixture is tuned by either varying the atomic density @xcite or the off - resonant value of the inter - species scattering length @xcite .",
    "also the temperature of the gas has been used to drive its collisionality and the importance of pauli blocking at very low temperatures has thereby been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "the role of collisions has also been investigated in dipolar collective modes of a boson - fermion mixture  @xcite at temperatures in both the quantum and classical regimes .",
    "the behaviour of the collision rate inferred from these experiments plays a crucial role in the development of strategies to improve the evaporative cooling techniques .",
    "in addition , the collisionality also affects other observables such as the damping and diffusion processes in the quantum mixture . in ref .",
    "@xcite an anisotropic expansion of a cigar - shaped two - component fermi gas has been observed .",
    "in contrast to the bosonic case , the anisotropy of the expansion at very low temperatures can not be taken as a clear signature of fermionic superfluidity @xcite and could be due to purely collisional effects .    while ergodic approximations on semiclassical boltzmann equations have been used to describe the evaporative cooling process  @xcite , a microscopic understanding of the transition towards hydrodynamics @xcite or of the anisotropic expansion in the case of attractive interactions  @xcite needs a complete numerical study of the dynamics of the quantum gas in position and momentum space @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe the strategy that we have used to solve numerically the vlasov - landau equations ( vle ) for an ultracold two - component fermion gas with a fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) algorithm .",
    "the two fermionic fluids are treated by a particle - dynamics approach  @xcite , accounting for mean - field interactions and for collisions between the two species .",
    "since the pauli principle causes a saturation of phase space at very low temperature , we have developed a _ locally adaptive importance - sampling _ technique which allows us to select the colliding particles in a way which is by several orders of magnitude faster than in standard monte carlo techniques .",
    "furthermore , the control of the occupancy of the unitary cells of phase space and a suitable choice of _ computational parameters _ permit us to avoid pauli inconsistencies during the dynamics .",
    "the two fermionic gases are confined inside different harmonic traps .",
    "regardless of the initial perturbation exciting the dipolar modes , we observe that as temperature is lowered , even through most collisions become forbidden classically and by the pauli principle , the few collisions that occur still suffice to drive the mixture from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime . this effect has already been predicted in our previous study  @xcite , where the angular degree of freedom was taken into account _ via _ an effective weight in a 2d numerical code .",
    "the limitations of the 2d approach are illustrated in the present work by comparing the oscillation frequencies and the damping rate of the dipolar oscillations evaluated within the 2d approach with those obtained by means of the present 3d scheme .",
    "we also find that the choice of the initial state modifies the spectra of the dipolar modes .",
    "in particular , if the symmetry of the initial configuration is broken and one species is initially at rest , kicking by the other species will induce oscillations at the characteristic frequency of the latter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce the physical model and describe in detail the numerical method developed to solve it . in sec .",

    "we describe each species in the box by means of a set of @xmath31 computational particles ( cp ) at phase - space points @xmath32 which are spread according to the distribution @xmath33 . in this way each fermion is represented by @xmath34 `` quarks '' .",
    "the initial selection of the computational particles is made by direct monte carlo sampling of the equilibrium distributions . moreover , since collisions are very sensitive to the statistical nature of the colliding particles , we enforce the pauli principle in each phase - space volume of size @xmath35 by resampling the computational particles that would otherwise exceed the allowed number of quarks @xmath36 in that cell .",
    "this further control is needed since we are dealing with a finite - size sample of fermi - dirac distributions .    the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ vlasov ] ) proceeds in two steps : ( i ) the lagrangian evolution of each distribution in phase space due to mean - field and external forces , and ( ii ) the occurrence of binary collisions among particles of the two species _  la _ boltzmann .",
    "once the initial state is prepared , the first stage of the evolution is carried out by means of a second - order symplectic integrator @xcite , and we update the position and velocity of each particle @xmath37 according to the scheme @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the mean - field force @xmath40 with @xmath41 or 2 . to compute the mean - field forces",
    "we first calculate the average density at a given cell by counting the number of particles inside the cell .",
    "the density is then numerically differentiated to obtain the forces at the grid points .",
    "the forces so calculated are finally linearly interpolated to the positions of the particles .",
    "it is worthwhile remembering that liouvillean evolutions are incompressible , so that a distribution function satisfying the pauli principle at a given time will satisfy the same constraint afterwards .",
    "this is an exact property whose _ numerical _ counterpart is checked during the course of the simulation .",
    "the second step of the solution involves binary collisions . at variance from the lagrangian evolution these are tracked on a coarser mesh of spacing of the order of the de  broglie wavelength ( a `` pauli cell '' ) . in this way",
    "we introduce a temperature - dependent scale which imposes a length scale on which the particles are effectively indistinguishable .",
    "this can be seen as an extension of the standard boltzmann approach .",
    "furthermore , collisions in different pauli cells can be handled independently due to the locality of eq .",
    "( [ integralcoll ] ) .",
    "our method allows us to count the number of collisions that occur step - by - step both classically and quantum - mechanically . in each pauli cell",
    "we add up the classical probability of collisions between every pair of particles and store the pairs whose probability is greater than a _ locally adapted _ threshold .",
    "this reduces the running time and the storage needs of the code by several orders of magnitude , and at the same time the threshold is adjusted in order to guarantee a correct supply of pairs at each time step .",
    "the quantum features of the mixture are included in the last step of the collision algorithm where the pauli suppression in eq .",
    "( [ integralcoll ] ) is applied .",
    "for every classically colliding pair we calculate the blocking terms @xmath42 by analyzing the occupancy of the momentum states in the pauli cell .",
    "we have explicitly verified that this procedure yields the correct pauli - suppressed fraction of collisions for a weakly interacting gas at least down to @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "we turn now to the discussion of the choice of computational parameters which allows us a reliable implementation of the lagrangian evolution . during the dynamics two unphysical processes",
    "may occur : ( i ) the presence of an excess of quarks in saturated phase - space cells , and",
    "( ii ) a broadening of the atomic cloud inside the trap . no cell of volume @xmath35 contains more than @xmath36 quarks for each species if the initial state has been accurately prepared . in this case , the inconsistent location of quarks takes place _ after _ we move the particles . indeed , both problems ( i ) and ( ii ) are related to the calculation of the accelerations induced by mean - field forces .",
    "as already mentioned , these forces are constructed first on the simulation grid and then interpolated to the actual position of each particle .",
    "therefore , an accurate description requires small spacings @xmath30 and a large number of computational particles per cell .",
    "aiming at understanding the impact on the results of the different choices for the values of @xmath36 and @xmath44 we have studied the axial motion of two interacting fermi clouds for several values of these parameters .",
    "hereafter we shall consider magnetically trapped @xmath0k atoms that are equally shared in two different zeeman states ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) and confined in isotropic harmonic traps with slightly different frequencies ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "for this test case we take the total number of particles @xmath49 , the mutual scattering length @xmath50 bohr radii ( a strongly collisional regime ) , and @xmath51 .",
    "both clouds are suddenly displaced from their equilibrium positions along the axial direction and start oscillating .",
    "we then analyze the evolution of the mixture for a total time @xmath52 ( @xmath53 complete oscillations ) and from the value of the centre - of - mass position @xmath54 we extract the oscillation frequencies @xmath55 of the two components and the average damping rate @xmath56 .",
    "the details of this procedure will be given in sec .",
    "in addition we also compute the axial spreads of the density profiles @xmath57 and the quantum collision rate @xmath58 by direct counting of the total collisions per particle , and monitor the number @xmath59 of computational particles located in forbidden phase - space cells .",
    "the latter shall be called pauli _",
    "inconsistencies_. for the system parameters here considered , we find that the oscillation frequencies do not vary considerably as @xmath36 and @xmath44 are varied .",
    "the dependence of the other observables is summarized in table  [ tavola ] .",

    "the average damping rate @xmath62 is sensitive to the spreading of the clouds , but seems to be less affected by the presence of few inconsistencies . on the other hand the collisional rate @xmath58 depends more strongly on both factors .    in summary",
    ", this test case has given us enough information to select appropriate parameters for reliable calculations . in the following numerical experiments we shall choose the most suitable values of @xmath36 and @xmath44 in order to ensure @xmath73 and a negligible @xmath59 , while keeping the computing time within reasonable limits .",
    "the quantum features of the mixture are most conveniently displayed by its collective modes , which in turn can be investigated by analyzing the dynamical response of the system under distortions of the equilibrium state .",
    "this can be done quite straightforwardly in actual experiments where the cloverleaf setup is used @xcite : a bias magnetic field displaces the centre of the trap , while a stern - gerlach separation of the two zeeman states could be obtained by adding a magnetic field gradient @xcite .    in the following",
    "we analyze the dipolar modes of the mixture at varying scattering length , as can be done _",
    "e.g. _ by exploiting feshbach resonances @xcite , and focus on two specific types of initial conditions : one in which both components start oscillating with the same amplitude ( _ in - phase oscillations _ ) and the other in which only the @xmath45 species is initially displaced ( _ kicked oscillations _ ) .",
    "the equilibrium fermionic density profiles for @xmath74 particles are first created with the traps centred at @xmath75 . at @xmath76 we let the confinements return to the position @xmath77 and hence the atoms start oscillating .",
    "in the collisionless regime the natural oscillation frequencies of the two species are different and correspond to trap frequencies renormalized by mean - field interactions , whereas the hydrodynamic regime is characterized by a common oscillation frequency of the two clouds , whose motions have been locked by frequent collisions between their particles . in this limit",
    "_ classical _ kinetic theory predicts that the common frequency is @xmath78 , which in our case gives @xmath79 .",

    "we calculate the average damping rate as @xmath81 and estimate the uncertainty of the result by analyzing the dependence of the fit parameters on the fitting range .",
    "this uncertainty is reported in the figures as error bars .",
    "the intermediate regime is characterized by a strong damping and larger uncertainties in the single - mode frequencies , which destroy the coherence of the oscillations .    as an illustration of the various dynamical regimes we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_z_normal ] the evolution of the centre of mass of the two species for three values of @xmath58 at @xmath51 . for @xmath82",
    "the two clouds oscillate independently without appreciable damping , whereas as @xmath83 approaches unity the two centres of mass start moving together but still incoherently and therefore their oscillations are damped . at higher collisionality ( @xmath84 ) the two species are locked and oscillate at the same frequency without damping .",
