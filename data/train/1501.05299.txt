    "misalignments due to projection effects are expected to be more common for small viewing angles , so the alignment we find suggests the viewing angles are not especially small , although our statistics are limited  @xcite .",

    ", @xcite found @xmath55 to be a good indicator of viewing angle , where @xmath56 with @xmath57 the 1.4  ghz core luminosity and @xmath58 the @xmath59-corrected optical v - band magnitude . assuming a flat core spectral index , we find that the @xmath60 values for these nls1s ( 1.51.9 ) are at the low end of the distribution for jet - selected radio - loud agn  ( e.g. , the mojave sample ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "this common assumption is supported in these particular cases by the alignment of the approaching parsec - scale jet and the longer kiloparsec - scale lobe  @xcite .",
    "both methods have a degeneracy between the speed and the viewing angle @xmath61 , but assuming @xmath62 , as seems to be the case , @xmath63 to within the likely accuracy of our measurements .",
    "first , we consider the flux ratio between the hotspots in the approaching and receding jets . if absorption is negligible along the additional optical path to the counter - jet , the expected ratio is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the projected speed at which the lobes advance at angle @xmath61 to the line of sight . for this calculation ,",
    "we use the ratio of the peak intensity ( in @xmath66 ) between the jet and counter - jet lobes , ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we obtain similar results if we instead use the ratio between the flux densities obtained by fitting a gaussian component model . for and , if we interpret the parsec - scale jets as two - sided , the flux density ratios of 1.2 and 2.3 imply jet speeds @xmath68=0.04 and 0.18 , comparable to those found at kiloparsec scales .",
    "we can also examine the asymmetry in length between the jet and counter - jet .",
    "if the structure is intrinsically symmetric , differential light travel time will cause the approaching jet to appear longer than the receding jet  @xcite . in this case , the ratio @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the lengths of the jet and counter - jet , and @xmath72 is the jet speed estimate .",
    "this method gives comparable results to the beaming ratio method , so overall we find @xmath730.3 .",
    "these correspond to doppler factors in the range @xmath741.5 , where @xmath75 .",
    "doppler beaming will increase the apparent brightness temperature of an emitting region relative to its intrinsic brightness temperature , @xmath76 , with the observed @xmath77 .",
    "using our vlba data , we computed @xmath78 in the emission frame from an elliptical gaussian model as @xmath79 where @xmath15 is the observing frequency in ghz and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are the flux density in janskys and the major and minor axis fwhms ( in mas ) of the core component .",
    "the brightness temperatures we find are all substantially below the equipartition limit of about @xmath83  k , compatible with a low doppler factor  @xcite . in each source",
    ", the presumed core has the highest brightness temperature of all fitted components by at least a factor of eight .",
    "the kinematic ages of these sources , computed assuming the approaching hotspots advanced outward steadily at their current speeds ( @xmath84 ) at a viewing angle @xmath8515 , are found to be a few times @xmath86@xmath4  y. these are in the range found for other extended radio - loud nls1s , consistent with nls1s being much younger than blazars or radio galaxies  @xcite .",
    "extended emission on kiloparsec scales was detected in all three of our targets .",
    "this is perhaps surprising in light of the small number of spatially extended nls1s previously known .",
    "however , few have been observed with the requisite angular resolution and sensitivity to detect the extensions we found here .",
    "because our targets were arbitrarily selected from a parent sample of bright , radio - loud nls1s , there was no reason all three were especially likely to show extended emission .",
    "thus , our findings suggest that other nls1s in the parent sample are also likely to be extended .",
    "observations of a larger sample are needed to verify this and , if true , to investigate whether this is generally true of all radio - loud nls1s or is a peculiar property of the parent sample .",
    "the morphologies of these sources on both kiloparsec and parsec scales are consistent with the presence of a mildly relativistic jet at a moderately small ( 1015 ) angle to the line of sight .",
    "the three sources we observed and most previously known extended nls1s where resolution permitted classification show fr  ii - like edge - brightened lobes . in contrast , @xcite recently reported edge - darkened fr  i - like extended radio emission in the nls1 .",
    "the latter is radio quiet , while the others are radio loud , suggesting that radio loudness may be connected to intrinsic source properties , such as jet power , rather than orientation effects .",
