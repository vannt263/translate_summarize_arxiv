    "the interplay of magnetic impurities with strongly correlated electron systems has attracted considerable attention over the past decade . the discovery of high - temperature superconductors stimulated studies of impurities in two - dimensional mott - insulators with long - range antiferromagnetic order  @xcite , where the copper - oxide parent compounds are driven to superconductivity by doping with holes or electrons . at low doping ,",
    "the dopants are localized and it is therefore insightful to study the limit of isolated static holes , which have been realized experimentally  @xcite and extensively studied theoretically  @xcite .",
    "there is a considerable body of work devoted to impurity bonds and added spins  @xcite , a generalization of the static hole case , and an unexpected behavior of the impurity magnetic susceptibility at low temperature has been revealed quite recently  @xcite .",
    "there is also a separate and very interesting kondo - like problem of an impurity in a magnetic system close to an @xmath9 quantum critical point  @xcite .",
    "however , in this work , we consider impurities ( added spins ) in a system with long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the very unusual behavior we find , closely related to that observed for the magnetic susceptibility and other quantities in the papers  @xcite , is due to gapless goldstone spin - wave excitations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we formulate the model , derive the spin - wave vertices and introduce an effective hamiltonian describing the interaction between impurities , which is explicitly calculated in sections [ sec : interaction ] an [ sec : rabi ] as a function of the distance between impurities .",
    "a similar problem has been considered earlier in ref .  , but only the case of small separations has been addressed , here we focus on the long - range behavior .",
    "the magnetization disturbance in the host antiferromagnet induced by a single impurity is then calculated in section [ sec : mag ] , and finally section vi presents our conclusions .",
