    "the rabi model @xcite , describing the interaction between a two - level system and a quantized harmonic oscillator , is a fundamental model in quantum optics . for the cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) experiments ,",

    "experiment progresses in rabi models @xcite in the ultrastrong coupling regime @xcite , in which the qubit - oscillator coupling strength becomes a considerable fraction of the oscillator s or qubit s frequency , the rwa breaks down but relatively complex quantum dynamics arises , bringing about many fascinating quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "explicitly analytic solution to the rabi model beyond the rwa is hard to obtain due to the non - integrability in its infinite - dimensional hilbert space . since it is difficult to capture the physics through numerical solution @xcite , various approximately analytical methods for obtaining the ground states of the symmetric rabi models ( srm )",
    "have been tried @xcite .",
    "especially , braak @xcite used the method based on the @xmath0 symmetry to analytically determine the spectrum of the single - qubit rabi model , which was dependent on the composite transcendental function defined through its power series but failed to derive the concrete form of the system s ground state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , ashhab _ et al .",
    "_ applied the method of adiabatic approximation to treat two extreme situations to obtain the eigenstates and eigenenergies in the single - qubit srm , i.e. , the situation with a high - frequency oscillator or a high - frequency qubit .",
    "ashhab @xcite used different order parameters to identify the phase regions of the single - qubit srm and found that the phase - transition - like behavior appeared when the oscillator s frequency was much lower than the qubit s frequency .",
    "lee and law @xcite used the transformation method to seek the approximately analytical ground state of the two - qubit srm in the near - resonance regime , and found that the two - qubit entanglement drops as the coupling strength further increased after it reached its maximum .",
    "previous studies consider the ground state of the srm , i.e. , the qubit - oscillator coupling strengths of the counterrotating - wave and corotating - wave interactions are equal . in this paper",
    ", we study the asymmetic rabi models ( asrm ) , i.e. , the coupling strengths for the counterrotating - wave and corotating - wave interactions are unequal , which helps to gain deep insight into the fundamentally physical property of such models .",

    "@xcite , we here use the transformation method to obtain the ground state of the single - qubit asrm under the near - resonance situation , where the oscillator s frequency approximates the qubit s frequency .",
    "differ further from ref .",
    "@xcite , our investigation for the two - qubit asrm intuitively identifies the collective contribution to its ground - state entanglement caused by the corotating - wave and counterrotating - wave interactions .",
    "we investigate the single- and two - qubit asrms and show that their approximately analytical ground states agree well with the exactly numerical solutions for a wide range of parameters under the near - resonance situation , and the ground - state energy has an approximately quadratic dependence on the coupling strengths stemming from contributions of the counterrotating - wave and corotating - wave interactions . besides",
    ", we show that the ground - state energy is mainly contributed by the counterrotating - wave interaction in both models . for the two - qubit asrm",
    ", we obtain the approximately analytical negativity .",
    "interestingly , for the two - qubit asrm , we find that , with the increase of the coupling strength in the counterrotating - wave or corotating - wave interaction , the two - qubit entanglement first reaches its maximum then drops to zero .",
    "the advantages of our result are the collective contributions to the ground state of the asrm caused by the corotating - wave interaction and counterrotating - wave interaction can be determined approximately , and the contribution of the counterrotating - wave interaction on the ground state energy is larger than that of the corotating - wave interaction .",
    "we find that the maximal two - qubit entanglement of the asrm is larger than that in the case of srm .",
    "however , the transformation method here is applicable to the asrm only under the near - resonant regime , where the oscillator s frequency approximates the qubit s frequency .",
    "when the corotating - wave and counterrotating - wave coupling constants are large enough in the asrm , the result obtained by the transformation method has a big error compared with that obtained by the exactly numerical method .",
    "such an investigation can also be generalized to the complex cases of three- and more - qubit asrm .",
    "note that the asrm can be realized by using two unbalanced raman channels between two atomic ground states induced by a cavity mode and two classical fields in theory @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the ground states of the single- and two - qubit asymmetric rabi models , in which the qubit - oscillator coupling strengths for the counterrotating - wave and corotating - wave interactions are unequal . </S>",
    "<S> we take the transformation method to obtain the approximately analytical ground states for both models and numerically verify its validity for a wide range of parameters under the near - resonance condition . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ground - state energy in either the single- or two - qubit asymmetric rabi model has an approximately quadratic dependence on the coupling strengths stemming from different contributions of the counterrotating - wave and corotating - wave interactions . </S>",
    "<S> for both models , we show that the ground - state energy is mainly contributed by the counterrotating - wave interaction . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for the two - qubit asymmetric rabi model , we find that , with the increase of the coupling strength in the counterrotating - wave or corotating - wave interaction , the two - qubit entanglement first reaches its maximum then drops to zero . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the maximum of the two - qubit entanglement in the two - qubit asymmetric rabi model can be much larger than that in the two - qubit symmetric rabi model . </S>"
