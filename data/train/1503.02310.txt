    "the spontaneous synchronization of mutually coupled oscillators is observed in many complex biological , chemical , physical and sociological systems with different origins of rhythmical activity and different mechanisms of coupling .",
    "depending on the context the term `` oscillator '' may refer to neurons @xcite , cardiac pacemaker cells @xcite , yeast cells @xcite , flashing fireflies @xcite , chirping crickets @xcite , applauding spectators @xcite , nano - mechanical resonators @xcite , lasers @xcite , superconducting josephson junctions @xcite , etc . the concept of spontaneous synchronization has proved to be useful in designing of artificial networked systems capable of self - organization in the absence of any centralized control mechanism @xcite .",
    "a common example of these systems is the so - called wireless sensor networks that typically consist of a number of spatially distributed devices with computational , sensing , memory and wireless communication capabilities @xcite .",
    "many industrial and civil applications of sensor networks require global clock synchronization of sensors @xcite or their distributed consensus on certain quantities of interest @xcite .",
    "a good synchronization scheme should provide the robustness with respect to failure of an individual sensors and take into account the diversity of sensor s properties and the presence of noise .",
    "the nature - inspired approach to this problem is completely distributed synchronization strategies based on the mutual coupling between sensors @xcite . in self - organizing sensor network",
    "the nodes are coupled through the exchange of information : each node transmit its own state and receive the signals from the neighbors .",
    "the knowledge of this information allows to single node to update itself occasionally in accordance with some correction rule so as to facilitate the global synchrony .",
    "another important technological application of synchronization phenomenon lies in the field of smart power grids @xcite .",
    "the modern electrical grids consist of thousands of generators and substations linked across large distances . to ensure stable operation and efficiency of the entire system",
    ", all the components that generate electricity must operate at the same frequency . in a decentralized smart power grid",
    ", the nodes could communicate among each other and correct their parameters in order to achieve and maintain the synchronized state .",
    "motivated by the discussed applications , in this work , we investigate an ensemble of phase oscillators for which the mutual coupling has a form of phase correction .",
    "our model implies that each oscillator evolves autonomously except for discrete times when the instantaneous correction events occur .",
    "we focus our attention on the simple correction rule which prescribe to oscillator to reset its phase to the ensemble - averaged value at a typical rate which is determined by the product of the coupling constant and the degree of global phase coherence .",
    "this basic model is inspired by the famous kuramoto model in which the effective coupling force is proportional to the amplitude of the mean field @xcite .",
    "the central result of the work is a synchronization transition upon the change of coupling constant .",
    "we demonstrate that for sufficiently strong coupling a partially synchronized state continuously bifurcates from incoherence .",
    "it is also shown how the synchronization properties of oscillators change in the case of non - linear relation between the correction rate and the degree of synchrony .",

    "we introduce the one - oscillator probability density of a phase distribution as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a solution of the stochastic equation ( [ phase dynamics ] ) for a fixed realization of noise .",
    "the time evolution of this function obeys the following fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath18 note that @xmath19 is nonnegative , @xmath20-periodic in @xmath21 , and satisfies the normalization condition @xmath22 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath23 , the order parameter ( [ order parameter0 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath24    for an arbitrary initial distribution @xmath25 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ fpe0 ] ) is given by the convolution @xmath26 , where the green function @xmath27 obeys the fokker - plank equation ( [ fpe0 ] ) together with the initial condition @xmath28 .",
    "it follows from ( [ green function ] ) that any initial state relaxes exponentially fast to the uniform distribution @xmath29 , which corresponds to zero order parameter ( [ order parameter1 ] ) .",
    "predictably , the diverse population of non - interacting noisy units behaves incoherently .",
    "next , let us assume that oscillators are coupled and update itself in order to improve the degree of global synchrony .",
    "namely , the @xmath9th oscillator evolves accordingly to the equation ( [ phase dynamics ] ) , but from time to time it instantaneously shifts the phase to the current ensemble - averaged value @xmath0 .",
    "we treat the updating time instants as completely random and statistically independent for different oscillators .",
    "the intensity of phase correction is characterized by a typical rate of updates @xmath30 per oscillator which , in general , may change over time . under these assumptions",
    ", the phase dynamics can be viewed as a drifting diffusion process on a circle in the presence of stochastic resetting @xcite with @xmath0 and @xmath30 playing a role of resetting position and resetting rate , respectively .",
    "we , thus , write the following master equation in the limit @xmath23 @xmath31 where @xmath0 is determined by ( [ order parameter1 ] ) and the one - oscillator probability density @xmath32 implies the averaging of phase dynamics over both the noise and stochastic phase correction .",
    "the structure of the equation ( [ fpe2 ] ) is quite transparent : the first and second terms in the right hand side correspond to a diffusion and uniform rotation at natural frequency ( cf . with eq .",
    "( [ fpe0 ] ) ) , while the third and fourth terms are related to updates and represent a negative probability flux out of each point @xmath21 and a corresponding positive probability flux into @xmath33 .",
    "taking into account the @xmath20-periodicity of function @xmath19 in @xmath21 it is easy to show the conservation of total probability ( [ normalization condition ] ) .",
    "the equation ( [ fpe2 ] ) constitutes the basis of our statistical model for coupled oscillators .",
    "the focus of this study is the synchronization properties of the system in the case when the correction rate @xmath30 is a function of the mean - field amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "it is useful to start with the description of the steady - state dynamics arising from the eq .",
    "( [ fpe2 ] ) with constant parameter @xmath30 .",

    "if frequency distribution @xmath12 has a single maximum at frequency @xmath36 and is symmetric , it is reasonable to seek @xmath37 in the form of some stationary profile uniformly rotating at frequency @xmath36 .",
    "then passing into the rotating frame @xmath38 and neglecting the time fluctuations of the order parameter at @xmath23 one can set @xmath39 without loss of generality . in result",
    ", the problem reduces to the stationary equation @xmath40 supplemented by the periodic condition @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",

    "we can now calculate the order parameter ( [ order parameter1 ] ) by using ( [ solution]-[coefficients ] ) . since @xmath39 by assumption , one readily obtains @xmath46 in a particular case of a lorentzian distribution @xmath47 we find exactly @xmath48 whereas for a normal distribution with standard deviation @xmath49 one obtains @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the complementary error function .",
    "importantly , the result ( [ order_parameter5 ] ) is extracted from the equation ( [ fpe2 ] ) which is justified by the assumption that updates are the random poisson events .",
    "there is a more general way to derive the steady - state coherence @xmath1 which is applicable to the case of arbitrary stationary statistics of updating time instants as long as these instants are independent for different oscillators .",
    "as previously , we suppose that density profile of oscillators in the phase circle is stationary in the the rotating frame , @xmath38 , and set @xmath39",
    ". then the oscillator dynamics may be thought of as a renewal process : each update resets the phase of oscillators to @xmath52 , whereas in the inter - update time intervals the evolution of phase is given by superposition of diffusion and detuning drift . the green function ( [ green function ] )",
    "rewriting in the rotating frame yields the probability density of phase distribution for a randomly chosen oscillator @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the time elapsed since the last update of this oscillator . to obtain the steady - state distribution @xmath55 one should average the eq .",
    "( [ green function rotating ] ) over different realization of the phase correction process , i.e. @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the probability density of random variable @xmath54 .",

    "( [ order parameter4 ] ) to the case of independent periodical correction processes .",
    "we assume that the sequence of updating events @xmath60 of @xmath9th oscillator is given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is updating period and @xmath63 is a random variable uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 otherwise .",
    "performing integration in ( [ order parameter4 ] ) with @xmath47 one obtains @xmath68 in agreement with intuition , eqs .",
    "( [ lorentzian ] ) , ( [ normal ] ) and ( [ lorentzian+periodic ] ) give @xmath69 ( incoherence ) and @xmath70 ( perfect synchrony ) at @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "we now turn to the more non - trivial case when the correction rate @xmath30 is not fixed but depends itself on the state of population .",
    "let us assume that updates occur the more frequently , the more higher the current degree of phase synchrony @xmath1 .",
    "apparently , this coupling scenario sets up a positive feedback so that as the population becomes more coherent , @xmath1 grows and so the correction rate @xmath30 increases , which tends to synchronize the oscillators even stronger .",
    "the situation is quite similar to classical kuramoto model where the mean - field coupling becomes stronger with the growth of global synchrony .",
    "it is well - known that kuramoto - like coupled oscillators exhibit spontaneous synchronization provided the interaction constant is large enough .",
    "the major question we wish to address here is whether there is a similar phenomenon in the discussed case of coupling through the coherence - induced phase correction .",
    "the answer is positive , below we demonstrate that for sufficiently strong coupling the phase correction compensates the destructive effects of noises and frequency s diversity and a partially synchronized state emerges .",
    "we focus our attention on the linear relation between coherence and correction rate , i.e. @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the interaction constant",
    ". the nonlinear generalizations of the model will be discussed briefly in section [ sec : nonlinear ] .",
    "one may expect that starting from an arbitrary initial condition the population of oscillators will settle into a steady state with constant coherence @xmath1 and average phase @xmath0 running at frequency @xmath36 .",
    "then the correction rate @xmath30 becomes time - independent and the results of the previous section can be straightforwardly applied . replacing @xmath30 by @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ order parameter4 ] ) , we find the following self - consistency condition for stationary coherence @xmath1 @xmath76 a trivial zero solution @xmath77 , corresponding to a incoherent state , holds for any value of @xmath78 .",

    "remarkably , formula ( [ critical coupling ] ) has the same structure as that for the critical coupling in the noisy kuramoto model @xcite . at the same time , the models differ by the critical behaviour of the order parameter .",
    "an expansion of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ self - consistent ] ) in powers of @xmath1 yields the linear scaling law @xmath3 in the vicinity of transition .",
    "in contrast , in kuramoto model the order parameter of the bifurcating branch obeys the square - root law @xmath81 near threshold .",
    "note also that how @xmath1 grows with @xmath78 strictly depends on the statistics of updates . for the sake of illustration ,",
    "suppose that @xmath12 is a lorentzian distribution .",
    "then , for stochastic phase correction we find from ( [ lorentzian ] ) exactly @xmath82 at @xmath83 .",
    "however , for periodic phase correction with coherence - dependent frequency of updates @xmath84 , one obtains from ( [ lorentzian+periodic ] ) the non - trivial solution @xmath85 at @xmath83 .",
    "the emergence of spontaneous synchronization is confirmed by simulations of large but finite population of oscillators .",

    "we generate the set of @xmath4 random numbers @xmath94 having distribution @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath97 , we switch the phase of @xmath9th oscillator to the current ensemble - averaged value @xmath98 .",
    "thus , the rules for the evolution of the system are as follows @xmath99    in numerics the initial phases of @xmath100 oscillators were uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath101 $ ] and the discrete time step @xmath102 was used .",
    "the diffusivity was @xmath103 and the natural frequencies @xmath11 were chosen from normal distribution @xmath12 with expected value @xmath104 and standard deviation @xmath105 .",
    "figure  [ pic : coherence ] represents numerical results for the time - averaged coherence @xmath1 as a function of coupling constant @xmath78 in comparison with theoretical curve for infinite-@xmath4 system .",
    "it can be seen that level of synchrony in population remains low until @xmath78 reaches a critical value @xmath106 , above which @xmath1 monotonically increases towards its asymptotic value of unity .",
    "the non - zero values of @xmath1 below @xmath2 in the simulation reflect fluctuations due to finite @xmath4 .",
    "the self - consistent arguments presented above do not provide any information about the stability of incoherent and partially synchronized states .",
    "the direct analysis of the stability properties is possible when the diversity of natural frequencies is negligible , i.e. @xmath107 .",
    "then , using eq .",
    "( [ fpe2 ] ) one can derive the following closed - form equations associated with angular and radial motions of the order parameter @xmath108 @xmath109 the equation ( [ phase equation ] ) suggests that the average phase just uniformly rotates at frequency @xmath36 . substituting @xmath73 we find easily the solution of amplitude equation ( [ amplitude equation ] ) @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an initial condition .",
    "for @xmath112 the coherence @xmath1 always decays to zero as @xmath113 , but for @xmath114 incoherent state loses stability and one obtains another attracting point @xmath115 corresponding to partially synchronized state . since @xmath107 by assumption , the critical value @xmath116 is consistent with ( [ critical coupling ] ) .",
    "if the natural frequencies of oscillators are non - identical , there is no closed description of global dynamics in terms of the order parameter . in the next subsection",
    "we propose perturbative approach which allows us to demonstrate that incoherent solution becomes linearly unstable as the strength of the coupling goes beyond the threshold ( [ critical coupling ] ) .      in what follows",
    "we look at the oscillator dynamics in the frame moving with frequency @xmath36 .",
    "let us consider a small perturbation of the uniform incoherent state @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "at lowest ( linear ) order in @xmath119 the evolution of perturbation is governed by equation @xmath120 to proceed we write a @xmath20-periodic function @xmath121 as a superposition of fourier harmonics @xmath122 note that normalization condition ( [ normalization condition ] ) automatically provides @xmath123 .",
    "when ( [ fourier harmonics ] ) is substituted into ( [ fpe3 ] ) , we obtain the following equation for the amplitude @xmath124 @xmath125 the evolution equation for @xmath126 is just the conjugate of ( [ high harmonics ] ) .",
    "next , substituting ( [ fourier harmonics ] ) into ( [ order parameter0 ] ) yields @xmath127 thus , only the first harmonic of the fourier decomposition , which is the so - called fundamental mode , contributes to the order parameter .    from ( [ high harmonics ] ) and ( [ order parameter ] ) one easily sees , that equation for the amplitude @xmath128 ( and @xmath129 ) is uncoupled @xmath130 let @xmath131 , then we obtain @xmath132 , where @xmath133 .",
    "the spectrum of the operator @xmath134 was constructed in @xcite in the context of noisy kuramoto model @xcite .",
    "they show that the continuous part of spectrum lies in left half - plane for any @xmath78 , thus corresponding modes never cause instability .",
    "in contrast , the location of discrete spectrum depends strongly on interaction constant @xmath78 .",
    "when @xmath78 exceeds a threshold ( [ critical coupling ] ) , the discrete real eigenvalue @xmath135 appears so that incoherent state becomes unstable .",
    "now we turn to the analysis of high order amplitudes .",
    "the equation ( [ high harmonics ] ) may be solved easily in terms of @xmath136 , @xmath137 and the initial condition @xmath138 .",
    "the result is @xmath139 the order parameter is completely determined by the fundamental mode through eq .",
    "( [ order parameter ] ) , thus we put @xmath140 , where the eigenvalue @xmath141 belongs to the spectrum described above . after integration one obtains @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "notice that the denominator in ( [ high amplitude ] ) never vanishes since @xmath145 and @xmath146 for any @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the second term in the rhs of ( [ high amplitude ] ) rapidly dies out , while the behaviour of the first one depends on the coupling strength @xmath78 . at @xmath147",
    "the spectrum @xmath141 lies in the left half - plane so that @xmath148 always decays to zero . for @xmath149",
    "the aforementioned positive discrete eigenvalue provides the exponential growth of @xmath148 .",
    "let us summarize the results of this subsection .",
    "the incoherent state goes linearly unstable to perturbation involving first harmonic for @xmath150 , where the critical coupling @xmath2 coincides with the prediction ( [ critical coupling ] ) of self - consistency analysis . above the threshold the instability of the first harmonic induces also the growth of the high order amplitudes",
    "so far , we have considered the linear relation between correction rate @xmath30 and amplitude of the order parameter @xmath1 .",
    "one may expect more complex and interesting collective behaviour in system with non - linear dependence @xmath151 .",
    "let us discuss as an illustration the quadratic model @xmath152 focusing on the case of identical oscillators , i.e. @xmath107 .",
    "then , the amplitude equation ( [ amplitude equation ] ) reads : @xmath153 at @xmath154 the only time - independent solution is @xmath77 and @xmath136 decays to zero as @xmath113 for any initial condition @xmath155 .",
    "however , for @xmath156 there are three fixed points : @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "thus , two partially synchronized branches bifurcate discontinuously from @xmath159 at @xmath160 , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : nonlinear ] .",
    "the incoherence ( @xmath77 ) and the upper synchronous state ( @xmath161 ) are stable , and the lower synchronous one ( @xmath162 ) is unstable .",
    "this means that the initial configurations with @xmath163 relax to incoherence as @xmath113 , while those with @xmath164 converge to the synchronized state at long - times .",
    "the described bistability is clearly observed in numerical simulations of finite-@xmath4 system , see fig .",
    "[ pic : quadratic ] .",
    "note also that in more general case @xmath165 with @xmath166 the critical coupling is @xmath167 and two partially synchronized branches bifurcate from @xmath168 . here",
    "again the system is bistable with respect to initial conditions .",
    "for the second particular example @xmath169 the amplitude equation ( [ amplitude equation ] ) yields @xmath170 the incoherent solution @xmath77 is unstable , while the only non - trivial solution @xmath171 ^ 2 $ ] is stable and exists for any @xmath78 .",
    "thus infinitely small coupling leads to spontaneous synchronization of system .",
    "this feature is common for all models @xmath165 with @xmath172 .",
    "as it was stated in the previous section , if oscillators have different natural frequencies , there is no closed evolution equation for the order parameter .",
    "nevertheless , the stationary values of @xmath1 can be found by substitution @xmath151 into ( [ critical coupling ] ) and solving the resulting self - consistency equation .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ lorentzian ] ) that when the frequency diversity is described by a lorentzian distribution @xmath12 one should just replace @xmath15 by @xmath173 in the above formulas for identical oscillators .",
    "notice , however , that these arguments do not indicate which of the found branches are stable .",
    "in this work , we proposed and investigated a new model of coupled non - identical noisy phase oscillators .",
    "we assumed that the mutual coupling manifests itself as a tendency of each oscillator to adjust its phase to the ensemble - averaged value through instantaneous phase shifts which occur at random updating time instants .",
    "then in the thermodynamic limit the time evolution of the one - oscillator probability density function is governed by the equation ( [ fpe0 ] ) .",
    "the key ingredient of our model is the coherence - dependent rate of updates : the more pronounced the coherence of the current state of population , the more frequently the phase shifts occur .",
    "we mainly concentrated on the simplest linear case when the typical rate of updates is given by the coupling constant multiplied by the coherence .",
    "the distribution of natural frequencies of oscillators was assumed to be unimodal and symmetric .",
    "our study revealed that the system exhibits the transition to spontaneous synchronization in a fashion similar to the mean - field kuramoto model .",
    "specifically , using the self - consistency arguments for an infinitely large population , we evaluated analytically the critical coupling strength ( [ critical coupling ] ) that marks the continuous onset of a partially synchronized solution .",
    "the same threshold follows from the linear stability analysis of incoherent state . in the vicinity of the critical value",
    ", the linear scaling of the order parameter is found .",
    "for the sake of illustration , we performed the numerical simulations of large number of oscillators undergoing coherence - induced phase correction .",
    "the analytical predictions for the degree of phase coherence in dependence on the coupling strength turned out to be in good agreement with numerical results , see fig .",
    "( [ pic : coherence ] ) .    for homogeneous population of oscillators , we found a closed description of global dynamics , which consists of two uncoupled evolution equations ( [ phase equation ] ) and ( [ amplitude equation ] ) for the amplitude and phase of the complex order parameter . based on this result , we were able to demonstrate easily the global stability of a partially synchronized state in the system of identical oscillators .",
    "finally we considered the direct generalization of the model to the case of a nonlinear coupling .",
    "when the relation between the correction rate and the coherence is given by a power law with exponent larger than unity , the synchronization transition is discontinuous ( fig .",
    "[ pic : nonlinear ] ) and above the threshold the oscillators exhibit bistability of global activity between incoherence and a partial synchronization ( fig .",
    "[ pic : quadratic ] ) .",
    "if the correction rate grows with the coherence slower than linearly , the system shows the non - zero level of synchrony for arbitrary small coupling constant ( fig .",
    "[ pic : nonlinear ] ) .    the model presented here can be further extended in many ways .",
    "obviously , the knowledge of the current states of nearby nodes can not be assumed perfect in a networked applications because of communication and processing time delays and information losses .",
    "from the perspective of the proposed theoretical framework this means that the delta - function in the rhs of our basic equation ( [ fpe2 ] ) should be replaced by some spread function which depends on the previous states of the system .",
    "another natural extension of the model includes the short - range interaction effects for regular and complex networks . in future studies , it is important also to consider the synchronization properties of system in which the updating time instants of different oscillators are correlated . here we have restricted ourselves to the case of `` attractive '' phase correction which attempts to mutually synchronize the oscillators .",
    "there are many practical situations in which the formation of a coherent state in ensemble of oscillatory units is unacceptable and should be avoided @xcite .",
    "one may expect that `` repulsive '' phase correction ( i.e. the phase shifts to @xmath174 rather than to @xmath0 ) is a good strategy to break the undesired synchronization of kuramoto - like coupled oscillators .",
