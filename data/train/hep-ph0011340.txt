    "the contributions of higher orders of the perturbation theory over the interaction with an electromagnetic field give the electromagnetic radiative corrections to the electron mass and lead to appearance of the anomalous magnetic moment ( amm ) of the electron @xcite .",
    "it is known that under influence of an external electromagnetic field these effects in particular the amm of electron are changed essentially @xcite , @xcite . here",
    "we consider how the mentioned effects modify in a medium .",
    "the correction to the electron mass is described by the amplitude defined by the diagram of the electron self - energy .",
    "we use the operator quasiclassical method ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this method",
    "the mentioned amplitude is described by the diagram where the electron first radiates a photon passing to a virtual state and then absorbs it .",
    "this corresponds to use of the non - covariant perturbation theory where in the high energy region only the contribution of this diagram survives . for the electron with energy @xmath1",
    "is the electron mass ) this process occurs in a rather long time ( or at a rather long distance ) known as the lifetime of the virtual state @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the characteristic transverse momentum of the process , the system @xmath4 is used . when the virtual electron is moving in a medium it scatters on atoms .",
    "the mean square of momentum transfer to the electron from a medium on the distance @xmath5 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the charge of nucleus , @xmath9 is the number density of atoms in the medium , @xmath10 is the screening radius of atom .    in the case of weak scattering @xmath11",
    "the influence of a medium is weak , in this case @xmath12 . at high energy",
    "it is possible that @xmath13.in this case the characteristic value of the momentum transfer ( giving the main contribution into the spectral probability ) is defined by the value of @xmath14 .",
    "the self - consistency condition is @xmath15 with @xmath14 increase the lifetime of the virtual state [ 1.1 ] decreases and correspondingly the corrections to the electron mass and amm of the electron are suppressed .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a motion of the charged particle in a medium in presence of an external electromagnetic field . in sec.2",
    "the general expressions for the correction to the electron mass and for amm of the electron are derived to order @xmath0 of the perturbation theory . in sec.3",
    "we analyze the influence of medium on amm of the electron in detail .",

    "@xmath21 it is convenient to start from eq.(7.59 ) of @xcite . summing over the final electron polarization",
    "we find that the combination @xmath21 in the expression for the probability of radiation ( [ 2.0 ] ) has the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vector describing the initial polarization of the electron ( in its rest frame ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the first two terms coincide with eq.(7.60 ) of @xcite ( unpolarized electrons ) , the third term depends on electron polarization .    in the paper @xcite(see also @xcite ) we derived the following expression for the spectral distribution of the probability of radiation per unit time for unpolarized electron @xmath26 where @xmath27 here @xmath28 is euler s constant , @xmath9 is the number density of atoms in the medium , @xmath29 is the coordinate in the two - dimensional space measured in the compton wavelength @xmath30 , which is conjugate to the space of the transverse momentum transfers measured in the electron mass @xmath31 .",
    "the total probability of radiation @xmath32 is connected with imaginary part of the radiative correction to the electron mass according to @xmath33 since the amplitude @xmath34 is the analytic function of the potential @xmath35 we have that @xmath36 one can derive this formula considering the self - energy diagram and the corresponding amplitude of forward scattering of electron ( see eqs.(12.18 ) and ( 12.39 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "here it is helpful also to use the approach formulated in @xcite .    in the presence of a homogeneous external field the hamiltonian ( [ 2.2 ] ) acquires the linear over",
    "coordinate term .",
    "one can find the explicit form of this term using the eq.(7.84 ) of @xcite and carrying out the scale transformation of variables according to eq.(2.7 ) of @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the electric field strength transverse to the velocity of particle @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath42 is the known parameter characterizing quantum effects in the radiation process .",
    "we split the potential @xmath43 in the same way as in eq.(2.17 ) of @xcite : @xmath44 the definition of the parameter @xmath45 will be considered below . according to this",
    "splitting and taking into account the addition to the hamiltonian ( [ 2.5 ] ) we present the propagators in eq.([2.1 ] ) as @xmath46 where @xmath47 the representation of the propagator @xmath48 permits to carry out its decomposition over the `` perturbation '' @xmath49 @xmath50 the procedure of matrix elements calculation in this decomposition was formulated in @xcite , see eqs.(2.30 ) , ( 2.31 ) . here",
    "the basic matrix element is @xmath51 .",

    "substituting into ( [ 2.11 ] ) @xmath57 and taking into account the constant term in the hamiltonian ( [ 2.12 ] ) we obtain @xmath58 .",

    "according to analysis performed in subsec.7.4 of @xcite and in @xcite the vector @xmath60 in ( [ 2.15 ] ) gets over to the operator @xmath61 standing in the formula ( [ 2.1 ] ) for @xmath34 from the right of the propagator @xmath48 and the vector @xmath61 in ( [ 2.15 ] ) gets over to the operator @xmath61 standing in the formula ( [ 2.1 ] ) for @xmath34 from the left of the propagator @xmath48 . as a result we have for the addition to @xmath34 in eqs.([2.1 ] ) and (",

    "this means that result will have the logarithmic accuracy over the scattering ( but not over an external field ) . with regard for an external field the parameter @xmath45 in eq.([2.6 ] ) is defined by a set of equations : @xmath65=1 \\quad { \\rm for } \\quad 4\\frac{\\chi^2}{u^2}+ 4ql_1 \\geq 1 , \\label{2.18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are defined in eq.([2.2 ] ) , @xmath69 is defined in eq.([2.6 ] ) .",
    "the matrix elements entering into the mass correction have in the used approximation the following form @xmath70dt,\\quad \\left<0|(g_f^{-1}{\\bf p}-{\\bf p}g_f^{-1 } ) |0\\right > = \\frac{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\chi$}}{2\\pi u } \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\exp(-it)\\frac{\\varphi}{\\cosh^2 \\frac{\\nu t}{2}}dt , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\varphi \\equiv \\varphi(\\chi , \\nu , t ) = \\exp\\left[-\\frac{4i\\chi^2t}{\\nu^2 u^2}\\left ( 1-\\frac{2}{\\nu t}\\tanh\\frac{\\nu t}{2 } \\right ) \\right ] . \\label{2.19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two first equations are consistent with obtained in @xcite .",
    "thus , in the used approximation ( @xmath71 ) we have for @xmath72 eq.([2.16 ] ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "within relativistic accuracy ( up to terms of higher order over @xmath75 ) the combination of vectors entering in eq.([2.20 ] ) can be written as ( see eq.(12.19 ) in @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 defined in eq.([2.14 ] ) is the magnetic field in the electron rest frame .",
    "here we use that @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the unit vector in the direction of acceleration ( this vector is used in @xcite ) .    in the electron rest frame one",
    "can consider the value re  @xmath80 depending on the electron spin as the energy of interaction of the amm of electron with the magnetic field @xmath77 ( see eq.(12.23 ) in @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath81    taking into account eqs.([2.4 ] ) , ( [ 2.16 ] ) , ( [ 2.16a ] ) , ( [ 2.20 ] ) , ( [ 3.1 ] ) , ( [ 3.2 ] ) we obtain the following general expression for the amm of electron moving in a medium in the presence of an external electromagnetic field : @xmath82    in the absence of scattering ( @xmath83 ) the expression ( [ 3.3 ] ) gets over into the formula for the amm of electron in external field ( see eq.(12.24 ) in @xcite and @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath84dt \\label{3.4}\\ ] ]    in the weak external field ( @xmath85 ) we obtain the formula for the amm of electron under influence of multiple scattering @xmath86 where @xmath87 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\beta=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\psi\\left(\\frac{1+x}{2 } \\right)- \\psi\\left(\\frac{x}{2 } \\right ) \\right ] , \\label{3.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function .",
    "the dependence of the amm of electron on its energy @xmath89 in gold is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that at energy @xmath90  gev value of amm is 0.85 part of standard quantity of amm ( sq ) , at energy @xmath91  tev it is 0.77 part of sq and at energy @xmath92  tev it is 0.5 part of sq .",
    "actually in all heavy elements the behavior of amm of electron will be quite similar , i.e. the scale of energy where the amm of electron deviates from sq is of order of tev .    in the case of weak effect of multiple scattering @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the characteristic electron energy starting with the multiple scattering distorted the whole spectrum of radiation ( @xmath95  tev in gold and it has a similar value for heavy elements ) .",
    "integrating in eq.([3.6 ] ) by parts over the variable @xmath96 we find @xmath97 the asymptotic behavior of the function @xmath98 at @xmath99 calculated in appendix : @xmath100 , \\label{3.9}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 substituting this result into ( [ 3.5 ] ) we obtain for amm of electron at @xmath102 @xmath103    at very high energy @xmath104 the effect of multiple scattering becomes strong . in this case",
    "( see eq.(3.3 ) in @xcite ) @xmath105 the main contribution into the integral ( [ 3.6 ] ) give the regions @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    ". making the substitution of variable as in ( [ a.8 ] ) and expanding the exponent as in appendix we have from ( [ a.11 ] ) the asymptotic expansion of amm of electron : @xmath108 redefinition of the characteristic energy @xmath109 is connected with enlargement of the radiation cone ( in comparison with @xmath75 ) or in another terms with increasing of the characteristic transverse momentum transfers due to the multiple scattering .",
    "to obtain the additional term in the radiation intensity depending on the spin of the radiating electron one has to substitute the formula ( [ 2.20 ] ) into expression for the spectral distribution of the probability of radiation per unit time eq.([2.1 ] ) and to multiply it on the photon energy @xmath110 . as a result",
    "we obtain the mentioned term @xmath111 so for polarized electrons the total intensity of radiation is the sum of eq.(3.8 ) of @xcite and @xmath112 ( [ 4.1 ] ) .    at @xmath102",
    "one can decompose @xmath113 in integral over @xmath96 in ( [ 4.1 ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath114 where @xmath115 is given by eq.(3.9 ) of @xcite .    in the opposite case of large energies",
    "@xmath104 the main contribution into integrals in ( [ 4.1 ] ) gives the region @xmath116 . then substituting the exponent by unity we find @xmath117 where @xmath115 is given by eq.(3.11 ) of @xcite",
    "here we discuss the possibility of experimental observation of influence of medium on the amm of electron . at a very high energy where the observation becomes feasible the rotation angle @xmath118 of the spin vector @xmath23 in the transverse to the particle velocity @xmath40 magnetic field @xmath41 depends only on the value of amm and",
    "does nt depend on the particle energy : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the path of electron in the field , @xmath121  oe . the dependence of @xmath122 on energy @xmath89 is found in sec.3 and shown in fig .    since at radiation of hard photons in a medium",
    "the picture is quite complicated : energy losses , cascade processes , spin flip and depolarization , it is desirable to measure the particles which do nt radiate photons on the path @xmath120 .",
    "the number of such particles @xmath123 is determined by the total probability of radiation in a medium found in @xcite , eqs.(3.12)-(3.14 ) : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the rotation angle for standard value of amm in qed ( @xmath126 ) , @xmath127 is the number of initial electrons",
