    "the structure and dynamics underlying complex networks have been widely investigated , providing insight for many systems where they arise naturally @xcite .",
    "complex networks appear in a wide variety of fields ranging from lasers @xcite , granular media @xcite , quantum transport @xcite , colloidal suspensions @xcite , electrical circuits @xcite , and time series analysis @xcite , to heart rhythms @xcite , epidemics @xcite , protein folding @xcite , and locomotion @xcite among others @xcite .    from the mathematical point of view , a network is a graph , composed by nodes or vertices and by their connections or edges @xcite .",
    "sometimes , each node is characterized by some dynamical state ( amplitude ) , which evolves according to some local contribution and to the interaction with the neighborhood . in other words ,",
    "the complexity of the system underlying the network may be introduced either in the way nodes are interconnected ( topology ) or in the way nodes evolve in time ( dynamics ) .    when studying network dynamics one frequently assumes a regular topology ( lattice ) where each node evolves according to some more or less complicated dynamics , typically fixed points @xcite , limit cycles @xcite or chaotic attractors @xcite .",
    "one main goal of this approach is to study the so - called spatio - temporal chaos which appears in many different spatially extended systems out from equilibrium , such as hydrodynamical flows , chemical reactions and biological systems@xcite .",
    "two main topics in this context concern the study of mechanisms underlying pattern formation and pattern selection@xcite and also the study of chaotic synchronization behavior@xcite .",
    "spatially extended systems are fundamentally modeled by ( i ) sets of coupled differential equations@xcite with nonlinear terms , where both time and amplitude are continuous , ( ii ) cellular automata @xcite , where both time and amplitude are discrete or ( iii ) coupled map lattices@xcite , where time is discrete as in cellular automata , but the space of states is continuous . in all these models",
    "the underlying networks have connections whose range assumes all values from @xmath3 ( nearest neighbors ) up to some maximum range , in particular the size of the system ( global coupling regime ) .",
    "in other words , neglecting boundary conditions , these network systems assume translational symmetry and therefore the underlying network is called a regular network .",
    "to study more complicated network structures , one usually neglects node dynamics and all complexity is introduced by the network topology , i.e.  by the way nodes are connected to each other .",
    "this may be done in three different ways @xcite : by randomly connecting the nodes ( random networks @xcite ) , by considering some random long - range connections in a regular network with some small range of couplings ( small - world networks @xcite ) , or by considering the introduction of new nodes which are connected to the previous ones following some rule of preferential attachment ( scale - free networks @xcite ) . for all these cases there is no translational symmetry and no typical range connection : connections do not have a ` spatial ' interpretation .",
    "therefore , one uses some general topological quantities to characterize each particular network , namely the average path length @xmath4 , i.e.  the average minimum number of connections linking two nodes , the clustering coefficient @xmath5 , defined as the average fraction of neighbors which are connected to each other , and the distribution of connections @xmath6 , representing the number of nodes having @xmath1 connections .",
    "table [ tab1 ] shows the values of these three quantities for all three topologies .",
    "cccc &  random   &  small - world   &  scale - free   + @xmath7 & @xmath8 & @xmath9 for small @xmath10 & @xmath11 + & & @xmath12 for large @xmath10 & + @xmath5 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 + @xmath6 & @xmath16 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 +    random networks were introduced by erds and rnyi in the late fifties@xcite to study organizing principles underlying some real networks @xcite . in random networks",
    "one defines some probability @xmath18 , function of the total number @xmath9 of nodes , which determines the probability for any two nodes to be connected in a total of @xmath9 nodes .",
    "consequently , the connections are typically long - range connections having a completely irregular structure .",
    "one main goal in studying random networks is to determine the critical probability @xmath19 , beyond which some specific property starts to be very likely to be observed , e.g.  the critical probability marking a transition to percolation @xcite .",
    "one important feature of random networks , which also appears in real networks , is their small average path length @xmath4 , i.e. the average distance between any two nodes increases slowly with the system size .",
    "however , unlike random networks , real networks also have large cluster coefficients @xmath5 .",
    "small - world networks were introduced recently by watts and strogatz @xcite in order to satisfy both these two features , short @xmath4 and large @xmath5 .",
    "small - world networks have short - range connections between neighbors , as in regular networks , but they also have long - range connections similar to random networks , without middle range ones .",
    "there are mainly two procedures to construct a small - world network : starting from same regular network , where each site is coupled to some number of first neighbors , one either _ rewires _ each regular connection with probability @xmath10 ( watts - strogatz model @xcite ) or _ adds _ a random connection to each node with probability @xmath10 ( newman - watts model@xcite ) .",
    "the second procedure is more appropriate for most purposes , since it avoids the possibility of generating disconnected clusters@xcite .",
    "both random and small - world topologies produce typically networks where connections obey a poisson distribution ( see tab .  [ tab1 ] ) . however , there are real systems which are scale - free , i.e.  where the connection distribution obeys a power - law .",
    "scale - free networks were introduced by barabsi and albert @xcite using growing and preferential attachment : one starts with a small amount of nodes totally interconnected , and adds iteratively one node with @xmath20 connections to the previous nodes , chosen from a probability function proportional to their number of connections . with this construction one",
    "obtains analytically@xcite a distribution of the connections @xmath21 , where @xmath22 as @xmath23 , independently of the initial number of fully interconnected nodes and of @xmath20 .",
    "it is also possible to generate scale - free networks , by either imposing _ a priori _ a power - law distribution of all connections randomly distributed , or by following a deterministic iterative rule for new nodes .",
    "the first procedure generates what is usually called a generalized random graph , while the latter was recently referred as deterministic scale - free network @xcite .",
    "deterministic scale - free networks , are hierarchical structures composed by some succession of generations of nodes , i.e.  the set of new nodes appearing simultaneously at a given iteration during the ` construction ' of the network , whose connections follow a particular power - law distribution @xcite , being more easier to handle .",
    "the main difference between random and deterministic scale - free networks is due to the local connectivity character of the latter : random constructions generate irregular long - range connections , while deterministic networks impose a succession of generation of new nodes which are , in some way , organized in ` space ' .",
    "therefore , deterministic networks are applied for instance in spin systems @xcite , and geographical and social networks @xcite .    after considering separately dynamical and topological complexity ,",
    "the next logical step toward real network dynamics is to consider them together .",
    "one important question addressed in this context is to know if full synchronization between oscillators in such complex topologies would appear and under which conditions it is stable . by full synchronization we mean the convergence of the amplitudes of all oscillators to the same value , evolving _ coherently _ from then on .",
    "therefore we call henceforth these fully synchronized states _ coherent states _ , to distinguish them from _ partially _ synchronized configurations , when several different clusters of nodes with the same amplitude are observed @xcite .",
    "synchronization and coherent behavior of oscillator networks with complex topologies have been studied for the random topology @xcite and small - world topology @xcite , and also scale - free networks @xcite . in random networks , it is already known @xcite that with high coupling strengths it is possible to fully synchronize oscillators and the corresponding stability condition may be computed @xcite from the matrix of connections characterizing the network . in small - world networks , synchronizability is observed @xcite only at the end of the small - world regime ( high values of @xmath10 ) , and recently @xcite it was found that heterogeneity in the coupling may destroy coherence .",
    "these findings for small - world networks are somehow controversial with the ones of other studies @xcite and other topological quantifiers have been proposed @xcite . in scale - free networks",
    "some recent studies indicate that synchronizability among oscillators depends on the average connectivity @xcite and is robust to delayed flow of information @xcite and to the removal of low - connected nodes @xcite .",
    "in this manuscript we describe the general approach to study coherent states in any general complex network of oscillators , and apply it to the particular case of a scale - free network of discrete - time oscillators , which is studied in great detail .",
    "we start in section [ sec : stab ] by describing the stability analysis approach to model in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) and deduce the corresponding conditions for synchronizability . in section",
    "[ sec : examp ] we apply this stability analysis procedure to the particular case of scale - free networks , comparing our results with numerical simulations .",
    "the random scale - free case is treated in section [ subsec : barabasi ] , where we show that the threshold value of such a transition as a function of coupling strength and outgoing connectivity obeys a power - law with an exponent that depends on the nonlinearity , while deterministic scale - free networks are studied in [ subsec : deter ] , namely a pseudo - fractal network @xcite and an apollonian network @xcite .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "for all the network topologies described above , if one considers discrete - time oscillators , namely maps of the interval , the equation of evolution for their amplitudes reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coupling parameter , @xmath26 labels time , @xmath27 with @xmath28 representing the amplitude at time - step @xmath26 of node @xmath29 , where @xmath9 is the total number of nodes , @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 being real nonlinear functions , and @xmath34 is the coupling ( laplacian ) matrix , whose element @xmath35 represents the relative strength with which node @xmath36 is coupled to node @xmath37 , and satisfies the conditions @xmath38 and @xmath39 for all @xmath29 . in general @xmath34",
    "is a non symmetric matrix .",
    "usually , one choses @xmath40 when studying linear coupling , and @xmath41 when studying nonlinear coupling . here",
    "we consider the nonlinear case . apart from this choice",
    ", all the information about dynamics is introduced in function @xmath42 , while all the information about the coupling topology ( regular , random , small - world or scale - free ) and the coupling regime ( either homogeneous or heterogeneous ) is included in the coupling matrix @xmath34 .    from eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) one easily sees that the coherent state @xmath43 evolves in time according to the local map @xmath44 .",
    "there are two ways to study these coherent states : either by studying the stability of small perturbations of the coherent states or by making statistics over significant large samples of initial configurations , counting how many converge to a coherent state . some attention to the parameter ranges",
    "must be taken , since the basin of attraction of the coherent states may be bounded by regions of phase space where amplitudes diverge . in particular , for maps of the interval one has @xmath45 in order to guarantee convergence of any initial configuration .    in this manuscript",
    "we will illustrate both analytical and numerical approaches for the particular case of scale - free networks . to this end",
    ", we define the coupling matrix as @xmath39 and @xmath46 if node @xmath36 is coupled to node @xmath37 , with @xmath47 representing the number of nodes of node @xmath37 and @xmath48 is the set of labels of all neighbors of node @xmath36 . if nodes @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "are not coupled @xmath49 .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 is a real number controlling the heterogeneity in the coupling : positive values of @xmath50 enhance the coupling strength with sites having larger number of neighbors , while negative values favor sites having less neighbors . for @xmath51",
    "the coupling between each site and its neighborhood is homogeneous .    for local dynamics",
    "we choose the well - known quadratic map @xmath52 , where the free parameter @xmath53 is restricted to the interval @xmath54 and contains all possible dynamical regimes from a fixed point ( e.g.  @xmath55 ) to fully developed chaotic orbits ( e.g.  @xmath56 ) .    when determining the stability of coherent states , various criteria are possible .",
    "for instance , one could compute the maximum lyapunov exponent and obtain the conditions where it is negative .",
    "however , maximum lyapunov exponents do not indicate the existence of local instabilities in the synchronous state , which may pull the trajectories apart from the coherent manifold .",
    "the correct approach is based on the variational equation of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) proposed by pecora and carroll @xcite , which is valid for any network of identical oscillators in what concerns their local dynamics ( quadratic map , lorenz system , etc . ) and their coupling regime ( linear , nonlinear , etc ) .",

    "if @xmath34 has zero - sum rows , i.e.  @xmath64 , and all its eigenvalues @xmath65 are real and nonnegative , then @xmath66 corresponds to the mode parallel to the synchronization manifold and the largest lyapunov exponent defines a master stability function @xcite .",
    "the coherent state is stable whenever @xmath67 for @xmath68 @xcite .    in our case",
    ", it is easy to check from eq .",
    "( [ matc ] ) that indeed @xmath34 have zero - row sum , yielding @xmath66",
    ". moreover , all the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath34 are real and non - negative , since @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a positive semidefinite symmetric matrix , namely @xmath71 with @xmath72 being the adjacency matrix of the network @xcite , and matrices @xmath73 and @xmath74 being the diagonal matrices with elements @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively .    from eq .",
    "( [ linestab ] ) and regarding the ordering of the eigenvalues @xmath63 one easily concludes that the stability condition reads @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the lyapunov exponent of the local single map .",
    "in particular there is a range of coupling strengths enabling synchronizability whenever @xmath79 holds .",
    "therefore , by computing the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix @xmath34 one is able to find the range of couplings for which coherent states are stable .",
    "this approach can be applied for any system ruled by eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) .",
    "for the particular case of scale - free networks , recent results @xcite show a transition to full synchronization for two particular values of the nonlinearity @xmath53 in the homogeneous regime ( @xmath51 ) , when either the coupling strength or the number of outgoing connections are varied . however , as far as we know there is no detailed study showing how these coherent states depend on all the parameter models .",
    "therefore , we present in this section detailed numerical results concerning synchronization in oscillator networks with scale - free topologies .",
    "our purpose is to give a complete example of how to study coherent solutions in complex networks of oscillators , comparing both the stability analysis and the numerical approaches .",
    "the stability analysis is carried out just by computing the boundary values @xmath80 and @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ epsint ] ) as a function of the model parameters .",
    "the ranges of values where @xmath82 are the ones where coherent solutions appear . as stated above , for discrete oscillators , ruled by maps of the interval , the condition @xmath83 must be added .",
    "numerically , to detect coherent solutions from a given sample of initial configurations , we compute the standard mean square deviation @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the average amplitude at a given time step @xmath26 .",
    "whenever @xmath86 is zero within numerical precision , i.e.  @xmath87 , all the nodes are synchronized at the same amplitude .",
    "we divide our approach in two parts , the first one concerning random scale - free networks ( section [ subsec : barabasi ] ) and a second one concerning deterministic scale - free networks ( section [ subsec : deter ] ) .      in this section ,",

    "figure [ fig9]a shows the distribution of the average standard deviation over a sample of @xmath91 initial configurations , from which one clearly sees that there are no coherent solutions . here",
    "the standard mean deviation is characterized by some large value which is almost constant beyond the weak coupling regime ( @xmath168 ) . in the weak coupling regime ( @xmath169 ) the standard mean square deviation is even larger , since the coupling is not strong enough to compensate the highly chaotic local dynamics ( @xmath56 ) .                     from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] one also sees that , for the pseudo - fractal and @xmath170 , the upper threshold @xmath81 increases monotonically with the heterogeneity , while for the apollonian network the upper threshold decreases .",
    "this particular difference between both networks should be due to their geometrical differences , in particular the fact that apollonian networks are embedded in euclidean space could explain in some way that stronger dominance in the coupling to the most connected nodes _ destroys _ coherence .",
    "choosing other values of @xmath53 for which local dynamics is chaotic , one finds the same values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 as functions of @xmath50 only shifted : @xmath80 gets smaller , while @xmath81 increases .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] illustrates this for the particular case of @xmath118 .",
    "decreasing even further the nonlinearity below the accumulation point @xmath171 synchronizability is attained for any positive value of @xmath50 , whenever the coupling strength is sufficiently strong .",
    "moreover there is a complicated dependence of the average standard deviation on the coupling strength and nonlinearity . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9]b for deterministic scale - free networks one finds two main regions in the @xmath172 plane : ( i ) a region where the standard mean square deviation is large and varies smoothly with the parameters and ( ii ) a region where the mean square deviation is smaller but has larger fluctuations .",
    "this second region , observed for @xmath173 , is somehow surprising , since irregular variations of the standard mean square deviation occur for low nonlinearity and high coupling strengths , precisely where one would expect the most regular behavior of the node dynamics . as for the heterogeneous coupling regime ( @xmath174 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] illustrates the transition to coherence by varying the heterogeneity @xmath50 for the pseudo - fractal ( fig .",
    "[ fig10]a ) and the apollonian network ( fig .",
    "[ fig10]b ) . for both networks",
    ", one sees that coherence sets in for @xmath175 , and the contour of the histograms marking the transition to coherence fits well the regions in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] labeled as sync. moreover , from figs .  [ fig10]c and [ fig10]d one observes that all these transitions to coherence are of first - order .",
    "finally , we study the role of hubs in deterministic scale - free networks , as we did in the previous section for random networks . to this end",
    ", we impose synchronization among @xmath176 generations , with @xmath177 being the total number of generations , and observed in what conditions coherent states are observed . in the pseudo - fractal network",
    "the first generation has @xmath178 nodes , the second one has @xmath179 nodes , and the @xmath180th generation has @xmath181 nodes . in the apollonian network",
    "the number of nodes appearing at each generation is precisely the same .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the standard mean square deviation as a function of coupling strength for pseudo - fractal ( fig .",
    "[ fig11]a ) and apollonian networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig11]b ) . in each case",
    "we choose the fully chaotic map ( @xmath56 ) and impose synchronization among the nodes of the first @xmath33 generations by setting them to be their mean amplitude at each time - step . in both cases , one sees that the standard mean square deviation remains large when synchronization is imposed to all @xmath182 generations .",
    "coherent solutions are only observed for @xmath183 and @xmath184 , beyond a coupling threshold which is smaller for the latter case .",
    "surprisingly , for @xmath185 the transition to coherence occurs for the same coupling strength in both networks .",
    "this may be due to the fact that , the fraction @xmath186 of nodes on which one imposes synchronization is the same for both networks and is high enough to suppress the influence of local connectivities .",
    "for @xmath183 the pseudo - fractal network shows coherence only above very high coupling strengths , near @xmath187 , while for apollonian networks the threshold is much lower .",
    "this difference in the coupling strength threshold is due to the fact that here the fraction of nodes @xmath188 to which synchronization is imposed is small enough to not suppress the influence of local connectivities .",
    "therefore , since the hubs in the pseudo - fractal network are less connected than the hubs in apollonian networks , one needs higher coupling strength to observe coherence . for any higher value @xmath177 of generations",
    "the same results are obtained , since one has for the quotient of the number of nodes between two successive generations @xmath189 as @xmath180 increases .    as a general remark",
    ", one observes from fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] that one needs to synchronize a rather high fraction of nodes ( @xmath190 ) to induce coherence .",
    "therefore , it seems that , dynamical collective behavior on scale - free networks is quite insensitive to hubs . as shown in the insets of figs .",
    "[ fig11]a and [ fig11]b , the transition to coherence is also of first - order .",
    "in this paper we studied fully synchronized solutions for three scale - free network topologies .",
    "the main conclusion is the following : in random scale - free networks synchronization of chaotic maps not only depends on the coupling strength but is mainly controlled by the outgoing connectivity @xmath1 , which is a measure of cohesion in the networks . because of that , one finds coherent solutions in random scale - free networks of fully chaotic logistic maps ( @xmath56 ) with outgoing connectivity @xmath117 and homogeneous coupling , but not in deterministic scale - free networks , since they have rather small effective outgoing connectivity , namely @xmath191 for the pseudo - fractal network and @xmath192 for the apollonian network .",
    "therefore , although the exponent @xmath146 of connection distributions in scale - free networks does not depend on the outgoing connectivity @xcite , we have shown that , in general , synchronization of chaotic maps in such coupling topologies is quite sensitive to it .    our results were obtained both numerically , from histogram of significantly large samples of initial configurations with a criterion for full synchronization based on the mean standard deviation of amplitudes , eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , and analytically from the eigenvalue spectra of the diagonalized variational equations computed at the coherent states , eq .",
    "( [ linestab ] ) .    in particular , for random scale - free networks , the threshold values of the coupling strength obey a power - law , eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) , as function of the outgoing connectivity .",
    "the exponent of this power - law depends on the nonlinearity @xmath53 of the chaotic map , being almost constant below @xmath193 and decreasing linearly above it .",
    "interestingly this value of @xmath194 is in the vicinity of the bifurcation of the quadratic map where the period-@xmath139 window appears , and coincides with the appearance of other nontrivial behaviors in coupled map lattices with regular topologies , namely in the velocity distribution of traveling wave solutions @xcite .    for deterministic scale - free networks with homogeneous coupling ,",
    "the same value @xmath194 indicates the threshold above which no coherent solutions are observed , independently of the coupling strength . above @xmath194 ,",
    "coherence is observed only for heterogeneous coupling , namely for @xmath167 .",
    "however , for this range of values , we have also shown that coherence is also absent either for very small or for very large coupling strengths , due to spatial instabilities .",
    "another particularly interesting result that still needs to be explained is that , for apollonian networks , the coupling threshold beyond which coherence disappears gets smaller when the heterogeneity is further increased .",
    "this point is not observed for the pseudo - fractal network and may be due to the geometrical differences between both deterministic networks .    as a general property",
    ", we have shown that all transitions to coherence are of first - order , indicating a similarity with other complex networks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , all results are robust not only against changes of the initial configurations of node amplitude but also , in random scale - free networks , against changes of the connection network",
