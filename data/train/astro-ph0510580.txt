    "the atmospheres of the lowest - luminosity brown dwarfs , hosting abundant molecular gas species and liquid and solid condensates , have more in common with the atmospheres of giant planets than main sequence stars .",
    "their unique spectral morphologies have brought about the introduction of two new spectral classes , l dwarfs and t dwarfs ( kirkpatrick 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "the former , more luminous objects , have red near infrared ( nir ) colors resulting from warm photospheric condensate dust clouds ; the latter have blue nir colors and relatively dust - free photospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the transition between these two classes has turned out to be rather intriguing . despite significant evolution in spectral morphology , effective temperatures ( t@xmath5 ) appear to be largely invariant between late - type l dwarfs and mid - type t dwarfs @xcite , while surface fluxes at 1  @xmath6 actually increase ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been surmised that the l / t transition may be modulated by a rapid evolution of photospheric condensate dust clouds , as opposed to the gradual sinking of these clouds as predicted by atmospheric models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have proposed that these clouds break apart , creating bright regions analogous to jupiter s 5 @xmath6 hot spots @xcite .",
    "@xcite postulate a phase of `` rapid rainout '' .",
    "@xcite , however , argue that the 1  @xmath6 brightening arises from variations in secondary parameters , such as age or metallicity . with such diversity in its interpretation",
    ", the l / t transition remains an outstanding problem in brown dwarf astrophysics .",
    "one key source in the midst of this transition is sdss  j042348.57@xmath0041403.5 ( hereafter sdss  0423@xmath00414 )",
    ". identified by @xcite in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , this relatively bright brown dwarf exhibits weak ch@xmath7 absorption at 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath6 and red nir colors indicative of residual photospheric condensate dust . while these properties are consistent with those of other early - type t dwarfs , sdss  0423@xmath00414 is noteworthy as its optical spectrum indicates an earlier l7.5 classification @xcite , and it is @xmath41  mag brighter in the nir than other similarly - typed dwarfs @xcite .",
    "sdss  0423@xmath00414 is also one of the few brown dwarfs to exhibit both 6708   absorption and 6563   h@xmath8 emission @xcite .",
    "it has been surmised that this source could be a young , extremely low mass brown dwarf ; a distended rapid rotator ; or an unresolved binary . in this letter , we demonstrate that sdss  0423@xmath00414 is a binary system straddling the l / t transition .",
    "sdss  0423@xmath00414 was observed as part of @xmath2 ( @xmath9 ) general observer program 9833 , targeting 22 t dwarfs spanning spectral types t0 to t8 with the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) .",
    "sources were observed with the nic1 detector ( pixel scale 0@xmath10432 ) and the f110w and f170 m filters , the former sampling the spectral flux peak of t dwarfs and the latter sampling the 1.6 @xmath6 ch@xmath7 band . f110w@xmath0f170 m color measures the depth of this band , distinguishing t dwarfs from other objects and providing an estimate of their spectral type .",
    "full details of our @xmath9 program will be presented in a forthcoming publication ( burgasser et al .  in prep . ) .",
    "observations of sdss  0423@xmath00414 were made on 22 july 2004 ( ut ) .",
    "multiple exposures totalling 407.7 and 1519.2  s were obtained in the f110w and f170 m filters , respectively , dithering in a spiral pattern with 1@xmath13 ( 30 nicmos pixels ) offsets .",
    "all data were reduced using the stsci calibration pipeline with calnica and the most recent calibration files as of august 2005 .",
    "combined mosaic images were also acquired from the calnicb output of the stsci pipeline .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] displays 2@xmath15@xmath102@xmath15 subsections of the mosaic images centered on sdss  0423@xmath00414 .",
    "two overlapping point sources are resolved , extending along a north - south axis .",
    "aperture photometry for the combined pair was measured using the iraf apphot routine , employing a wide ( 20 pixel radius ) circular aperture containing @xmath1199% of the total flux of the pair .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were corrected to the arizona vega system using nicmos flux calibration parameters ; vega fluxes of 1785.9 and 946.2 jy for f110w and f170 m , respectively @xcite ; and zeropoints of 0.02 mag .",
    "uncertainties in the photometry include photon shot noise and read noise , 0.2% uncertainty in the nicmos photometric calibration , 1% stability in the zeropoint , and 2% uncertainty due to the extreme spectral morphology of the target @xcite .",
    "derived magnitudes are listed in table  1 .    to measure the component fluxes , we employed an iterative psf fitting routine as described in @xcite .",
    "model images were generated from psfs of the unresolved sources 2mass j05591914@xmath01404488 and sdss j125453.90@xmath0012247.4 ( * ? ? ?",

    ". however , the latter are substantially brighter at optical wavelengths than l or t dwarfs , which have @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the absence of an optical counterpart at the position of sdss  0423@xmath00414 in serc er survey images ( @xmath16 ) implies @xmath17 and spectral types @xmath11m6 for both components .",
    "in addition , no optical counterpart was detected in deep @xmath18- and @xmath19-band images obtained on 24 january 2003 ( ut ) using the palomar 1.5 m telescope facility ccd camera , down to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the two sources are l and/or t dwarfs .",
    "are they physically associated ?",
    "current estimates of the surface density of l and t dwarfs for @xmath22 ( consistent with the brightness of the secondary ) are of order 10@xmath23 deg@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "hence , the probability of two such objects lying within 1@xmath25 of each other is @xmath26 , ruling out random alignment at the 99.98% confidence level .",
    "common proper motion can be constrained by the fact that the pair is unresolved in two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; cutri et al .",
    "2003 ) images , for which point sources can be resolved for separations @xmath111@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this restricts the motion of an unassociated source to 0@xmath1080@xmath142 yr@xmath27 at a position angle consistent within @xmath340@xmath28 .",
    "these limits , coupled with the late spectrophotometric types and angular proximity of the two sources , lead us to conclude that they are physically associated .",
    "the colors of the sources provide only rough constraints on their spectral types , l5t3 .",
    "absolute magnitudes also provide weak constraints due to the inflections in absolute magnitude / spectral type trends around type t0 .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 magnitudes of the brighter ( a ) component , 14.86@xmath30.12 and 13.08@xmath30.12 , are consistent with both mid- and late - l ( l5l7 ) and early- and mid - t ( t2t4 ) types ( burgasser et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the fainter ( b ) component , 15.44@xmath30.12 and 13.93@xmath30.12 , are similar to both early- ( t0t1 ) and mid - type ( t4t5 ) t dwarfs . to derive more precise estimates , we compared `` hybrid '' nir spectra of late - type l and t dwarf components to the unresolved spectrum of sdss  0423@xmath00414 ( * ? ? ?",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] demonstrates how an l6.5+t2 combination provides an excellent match to spectral energy distribution of sdss  0423@xmath00414 , particularly ch@xmath7 and h@xmath31o band strengths .",
    "the hybrid spectrum has @xmath32 , similar to the measured color of 1.69@xmath30.04 .",
    "good agreements were also found with l5.5+t1 , l5.5+t2 and l6.5+t1 combinations . using an l8 primary resulted in ch@xmath7 bands that were too weak and excessive @xmath33-band flux , while a t3.5 secondary gave ch@xmath7 bands that were too strong . combining these results with comparisons of the individual colors and absolute magnitudes , we estimate spectral types of l6@xmath31 and t2@xmath31 for the two components of sdss  0423@xmath00414 , although resolved spectroscopy is required for more accurate classifications .",
    "the binary nature of sdss  0423@xmath00414ab explains many of its unusual properties , most notably its overluminosity and high t@xmath5 relative to similarly - classified brown dwarfs .",
    "@xcite derive @xmath34 = 14501825  k from the combined luminosity , @xmath4300  k hotter than typical l8t2 brown dwarfs .",
    "the component temperatures ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) can be deduced from the relative luminosities and stefan s law , assuming similar radii . however , the luminosity ratio is difficult to estimate for this system due to the inflection in absolute brightnesses across the l / t transition . if @xmath37 then @xmath38 @xmath39 0.6 ; however , both components could have identical luminosities . assuming an average @xmath38 @xmath39 0.8 , we estimate @xmath35 = 12501575  k and @xmath36 = 12001500  k , consistent with most t@xmath5/spectral type trends to date ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the mass ratio of this pair to be m@xmath40/m@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the combination of close separation and near - unity mass ratio are common among substellar field binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sdss  0423@xmath00414 joins a growing list of visually resolved substellar binaries , of which roughly 30 are now known ( e.g. , seigler et al .  2005 ) .",

    ", implying a binary fraction of 47@xmath42% . even considering",
    "biases incurred from the sources having been chosen from magnitude - limited search samples , this fraction is still over twice that of magnitude - limited samples of early - type l dwarfs and mid- and late - type t dwarfs ( @xmath420% ; @xcite ) , and represents a lower limit due to the probable existence of tighter , unresolved systems . an excess of late - l / early - t binaries could provide a natural explanation for many of the photometric and spectroscopic peculiarities observed across the l / t transition .",
    "a more rigorous analysis of binary fraction trends and their implications will be presented in a forthcoming publication .    the close separation and proximity of the sdss  0423@xmath00414 pair makes it a useful system for dynamical mass measurements .",
    "assuming an age of 15 gyr for this system ( typical for field sources ) and component t@xmath5s as deduced above , evolutionary models @xcite predict component masses of 0.0400.075 m@xmath43 ; at least one component has m @xmath44 0.065 m@xmath43 due to the presence of absorption in the composite optical spectrum .",
    "these estimates imply an orbital period of 1520  yr ( assuming an orbital separation of 1.29@xmath12 ; fischer & marcy 1992 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath9 and/or ground - based adaptive optics observations should be able to measure significant orbital motion over the next few years .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have pointed out that binary systems with li absorption can be age - dated to higher precision than other field brown dwarfs , particularly if only one component exhibits the line .",
    "this system could therefore be exploited to empirically test brown dwarf theoretical models with precise mass and age measurements .",
