    "graphene is a unique electronic material which consists simply of a single two - dimensional ( 2d ) atomic membrane of carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the seminal discovery @xcite that graphene can be gated ( i.e. , `` doped '' with a finite free carrier density ) to produce a variable carrier density ( @xmath0 ) electron or hole 2d system simply by tuning an external gate voltage has given rise to a truly amazing level of intellectual activity with more that 10,000 graphene publications appearing in the scientific literature since 2005 covering many disparate fields including physics , chemistry , materials science , electrical engineering , and chemical engineering . from the fundamental perspective of quantum condensed matter physics graphene is an intriguing system @xcite in many ways : it is a true 2d stable crystal with unique elastic and mechanical properties , and gated graphene is an exotic 2d gapless and chiral electron system with linear energy dispersion , i.e. , the electron - hole bands in graphene have dirac - weyl massless linear dispersion instead of the usual parabolic energy dispersion one sees in most solid state materials .",
    "graphene is thus both a semimetal and a gapless semiconductor , which can be easily doped by an external gate voltage to induce a variable carrier density @xmath0 ( either electrons or holes ) with a special charge neutrality point ( @xmath1 ) , often called the dirac point , separating electron bands from the hole bands .",
    "the purpose of the current work is to theoretically consider electron - electron interaction effects in gated graphene ( i.e. @xmath2 ) , sometimes also called `` extrinsic '' graphene @xcite to contrast with very special situation of `` intrinsic '' graphene ( @xmath1 ) where the chemical potential is precisely located at the dirac point . since the dirac point itself ( @xmath3 precisely )",
    "is by definition a set of measure zero ( particularly because of the gaplessness of graphene bands ) , most experiments can only probe extrinsic graphene ( with @xmath4 ) with any conclusion about the dirac point being obtained indirectly through an extrapolation to zero density .",
    "the physics of graphene dirac point is interesting in its own right as it is well - established @xcite that intrinsic graphene ( @xmath3 ) is not a fermi liquid .",
    "the presence of disorder - induced electron - hole puddles@xcite makes it difficult to study the physics of pristine dirac point physics .",
    "interaction physics at the dirac point is outside the scope of the current work .",
    "since our interest is extrinsic gated graphene at @xmath5 , we consider our starting noninteracting system to have the fermi energy ( @xmath6 , or equivalently the chemical potential @xmath7 ) in the conduction band ( with no loss of generality ) given by @xmath8 , choosing @xmath9 throughout , where @xmath10 is the graphene ground state degeneracy arising from spin ( 2 ) and valley ( 2 ) degeneracies .",
    "the fermi wave vector @xmath11 defines the 2d momentum upto which the conduction band with linear noninteracting band dispersion @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the 2d wave vector , is filled .",
    "the linear band dispersion leads to a simple linear @xmath14 density of states , which then provides @xmath15 , @xmath6 , _ etc . _ quoted above @xcite . here",
    "@xmath16 cm / s is the noninteracting graphene velocity obtained , for example , from band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "electron - electron interaction would affect the graphene noninteracting dispersion @xmath12 , perhaps modifying the dispersion itself , i.e. , changing the constant @xmath17 , which is independent of both the carrier density and the substrate material supporting the graphene layer in the noninteracting single - particle approximation , to a renormalized wave vector - dependent nonlinear graphene velocity @xmath18 which depends not only on @xmath19 , but also on the carrier density @xmath0 and the substrate material ( through the background dielectric constant @xmath20 ) .",
    "the main goal of our work is to make precise ( and experimentally verifiable ) quantitative predictions about the interacting quasiparticle energy dispersion and the renormalized interacting velocity @xmath21 in gated extrinsic graphene which , in principle , may depend on wave vector , carrier density , and the substrate material .",
    "quite surprisingly , this issue , in spite of its considerable importance , has not been studied in details in the existing theoretical literature as earlier work on the subject has concentrated mostly on interaction effects in intrinsic graphene @xcite and the associated instabilities of the dirac point or on the numerical calculations of the interacting spectral function in a narrow range of momentum and frequency @xcite .",
    "in addition , we investigate the renormalized quasiparticle energy dispersion for different interaction strength ( i.e. @xmath22 ) values to investigate instability at low energy regime ( i.e. , near the dirac point ) .",
    "it is expected that the quasiparticle feature may be modified due to the many body effects ( plasmonic feature ) as seen in the arpes@xcite .",
    "however , unexpectedly we find that the quasiparticle features disappear as the interaction strength increases . in earlier work@xcite some of the features presented here",
    "are discussed for small @xmath22 values ( @xmath23 ) . however , the instability due to many body effect is significantly enhanced for large @xmath22 and for low densities , which is not discussed elsewhere .",
    "this is a very interesting prediction and can be observed in samples with high @xmath22 value ( for example , suspended graphene ) .",
    "in fact , we find that a careful experimental study of even the standard graphene on substrates should be able to discern our predicted signature of a dispersion instability in the spectral function .",
    "we emphasize that there have been several theoretical investigations of interaction effects in graphene@xcite including some by us @xcite as well as a few careful experimental studies @xcite comparing with the theoretical predictions .",
    "our work is based on existing @xcite and well - established theoretical techniques ( namely , feynman - dyson diagrammatic perturbation theory using the dynamically screened coulomb interaction as the effective coupling constant  a technique that goes back to the 1960s and has been used extensively and successfully to calculate many - body interaction effects on single - particle properties in metals , doped semiconductors , and 2d electron systems as well as in band structure calculations under the name of @xmath24 approximation ) . in spite of the existing theoretical literature dealing with the calculation of electron - electron interaction - induced many - body renormalization effects in doped graphene , the results presented in the current work are completely new and are directly relevant to experimental measurements .",
    "although based on the standard @xmath24-type theoretical approximation our numerical results for the coupling constant dependent graphene fermi velocity as well as the wave vector dependent graphene velocity are unavailable in the literature .",
    "these quantities can be measured directly by stm / sts or arpes measurements to be compared with our theoretical results .",
    "similarly , our results for the anomalous quasiparticle dispersion and the associated collapse of the quasiparticle picture for graphene at low carrier densities are new although the graphene spectral function itself has earlier been calculated in the literature @xcite .",
    "finally , our comparison between on - shell and off - shell self - energy approximations for graphene many - body renormalization has not earlier been investigated in the graphene literature where all earlier work specifically considered the off - shell solution of the dyson equation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the general theory of the self - energy of graphene . in sec .",
    "iii we present our calculated renormalized fermi velocities within on - shell and off - shell approximations . in sec .",
    "iv we show the detail results of the quasiparticle spectral function and the instability of the graphene dispersion , and finally we conclude in sec . v.     included in our theory with the wiggly and the non - wiggly lines representing the bare interaction ( @xmath25 ) and green s function ( @xmath26 ) respectively .",
    "figures ( e ) and ( f ) represent two second - order contributions ignored in the theory , which may approximately cancel each other leading to the on - shell approximation being quantitatively `` better '' than the off - shell dyson s solution . ]",
    "the central theoretical quantity we calculate is the graphene dynamical self - energy function @xmath27 , which , in general , depends both on momentum ( wave vector ) and energy ( frequency ) independently .",
    "an exact theoretical evaluation of the self - energy for electrons interacting via the long - range coulomb interaction ( @xmath25 ) is , of course , impossible for arbitrary carrier density and interaction strength , but an excellent approximation scheme , which goes by the various nomenclatures such as the @xmath24-approximation or the dynamical rpa , is well - established for parabolic metallic 2d and 3d electron systems .",
    "this approximation involves calculating the self - energy in an infinite order diagrammatic perturbation theory including all diagrams containing ( to all orders ) the bare coulomb interaction , the bare electron green s function , and the bare polarizability ( i.e. , the bubble or the ring diagrams formed by the closed loop of an electron and a hole propagator ) .",
    "equivalently , this infinite series of ring diagrams ( we show in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] the self - energy diagrams of the theory ) corresponds to the leading - order perturbation expansion in the dynamically screened coulomb interaction ( @xmath28 ) where the screening is done by the electronic dynamical dielectric function ( @xmath29 ) obtained in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) involving the infinite series of ring diagrams @xcite .",
    "the validity of considering rpa type diagrams is based on the infrared divergence of the ring diagrams .",
    "all non - rpa diagrams are negligible compared with the same order rpa diagram .",
    "the divergence can be controlled by the rpa re - summation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the justification for why non - rpa diagrams in graphene can be neglected is discussed in ref .  .",
    "we also emphasize that there is no known controlled technique for systematically calculating quasiparticle properties in interacting electron systems other than the @xmath24 approximation based on rpa . within the leading - order dynamical rpa the self - energy @xmath27 of graphene is given by@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the inverse temperature , @xmath28 is the screened coulomb interaction , @xmath32^{-1}$ ] is the bare green s function ( where @xmath33 , and @xmath7 are matsubara fermion , boson frequencies and chemical potential , respectively)@xcite . due to the chiral property of graphene the self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) has an additional term ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) which does not exist in the non - chiral systems .",
    "the @xmath34 arises from the overlap of @xmath35 and @xmath36 and is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are band indices of graphene and @xmath39 is the angle between @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the screened coulomb interaction @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the bare coulomb potential ( @xmath44background dielectric constant ) , and @xmath45 is the 2d dynamical dielectric function . in the rpa @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the noninteracting polarizability@xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath48 , @xmath28 , @xmath49 involve multidimensional complex integrals over internal momentum and energy .",
    "since there has been substantial earlier work in the literature on the theory of the electron self - energy within the dynamical rpa @xmath24 approximation in systems as different as 3d electron gas @xcite , 2d electron gas @xcite , 1d electron gas @xcite , monolayer graphene @xcite , and bilayer graphene @xcite , we refrain from giving more theoretical details on our calculations , concentrating instead on the results and their experimental implications for observable many - body effects in gated graphene .",
    "we note that ( @xmath50 ) the calculation of the self - energy @xmath48 leads immediately to the interacting green s function @xmath51 , [ i.e. @xmath52 which contains all information about the single - particle properties of graphene , and that ( ii ) once the bare polarizability @xmath49 , which was earlier obtained @xcite , is known , the calculation of self - energy [ eq .",
    "[ sigma ] ] would lead to @xmath51 since @xmath26 and @xmath25 are known by definition .",
    "we note that we are utilizing the leading - order  @xmath53 \" rather than the self - consistent  @xmath24 \" approximation in our theory .",
    "we believe the @xmath53 approximation to be more meaningful from a diagrammatic perturbative sense since it is a true leading - order expansion in the effective rpa screened dynamical interaction @xmath28 whereas the iterative @xmath24 approximation mixes in unwanted higher - order terms in @xmath28 which are inconsistent with the leading - order expansion in @xmath28 .    we emphasize that the graphene self - energy calculation is highly nontrivial and extremely subtle because one must include both intraband and interband contributions in the theory . remembering that the noninteracting green s function @xmath54^{-1}$ ] has its poles at the noninteracting energy @xmath55",
    ", we get the following equation for the poles of the interacting green s function @xmath56 , which defines a general integral equation ( dyson equation ) for the interacting graphene dispersion : @xmath57 .",

    ". we solve the integral equation defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyson ] ) numerically iteratively to obtain the interacting quasiparticle dispersion @xmath58 , and refer to this iterative solution as the `` off - shell '' approximation which alludes to the full solution of the dyson equation . an alternative approximation for the self - energy ,",
    "the so - called on - shell approximation , goes back to the early days of diagrammatic many - body theory @xcite , and has , in particular , been emphasized by rice @xcite . in the on - shell approximation ,",
    "one simply takes the first iterative solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyson ] ) to get @xmath59 , \\label{eq : onshell}\\ ] ] which does not involve solving the dyson integral equation .",
    "this would define an on - shell graphene velocity given by @xmath60 . note that the imaginary part of on - shell self energy near fermi surface behaves as im[@xmath61 \\propto [ e_0(k ) -",
    "\\mu]^2 \\ln    [ e_0(k ) - \\mu]$ ] , where @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite thus the on - shell imaginary part of the self - energy certainly vanishes as @xmath63 . in fact , the inelastic scattering rate , an extensively used physical quantity of much experimental interest , is precisely the on - shell approximation to the im[@xmath64 $ ] .",
    "we will compare the on - shell and the off - shell graphene self - energy solution within our dynamical rpa scheme because the issue of which of these two is a better approximation to the coulomb self - energy problem has been much discussed in the literature over the last 50 years @xcite .",
    "these past discussions of course focused only on regular nonchiral parabolic electron systems with only intraband contributions and our current work is on chiral , linearly dispersing , gapless graphene carriers where both intra- and inter - band contributions to the self - energy must be included in the theory ( as we do in our current work ) .",
    "we note that there is no deep principle that could make the `` correct '' theoretical choice between the on - shell and the off - shell approximation within the @xmath53 self - energy scheme since both schemes obey the ward identity and the dyson equation up to the order in the interaction the theory is meant to be valid .",
    "( i.e. , leading order in the dynamically screened interaction @xmath28 ) . the only effective choice between these approximations is an operational one based on the detailed quantitative comparison with the experimental data as has already been discussed in the past @xcite",
    ".    it may be worthwhile for us to make some remarks on the on - shell versus off - shell many - body self - energy approximation in the context of graphene physics , and why this may be a question of substantial importance .",
    "this issue arises because the dynamical coulomb self - energy can only be calculated approximately in the leading - order gw - rpa approximation .",
    "if an exact self - energy function @xmath27 is available , then obviously the full dyson equation solution would be necessary to obtain the quasiparticle energy dispersion @xmath65 , making the off - shell velocity the only meaningful quantity .",
    "it has , however , been pointed out @xcite that the leading - order screened interaction expansion ( i.e. , the ring diagram approximation ) for the calculated rpa self - energy necessitates using the leading - order iterative solution of @xmath27 , i.e. , using the on - shell approximation @xmath66 , instead of the full solution of the integral dyson equation so as not to mix various orders of approximation in the theory .",
    "in particular , it has been argued@xcite that the on - shell approximation of the self - energy is , in fact , quantitatively better than the off - shell approximation within the gw - rpa scheme of the coulomb self - energy evaluation for metallic electrons .",
    "the subject has been controversial @xcite with no definite consensus in the literature in spite of the almost 50-year history of the topic",
    ". our careful quantitative comparison of on - shell and off - shell approximations , when compared with the available experimental data in graphene should lead to a resolution of this old and important theoretical controversy .",
    "our results tend to indicate that the off - shell approximation works better for graphene as described below .",
    "we emphasize , so that there is no misunderstanding of this point , that if the self - energy is evaluated exactly then one must always solve the dyson equation , and as such the off - shell theory defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyson ] ) is the only option for the quasiparticle dispersion in any exact theory .",
    "the question arises , however , whether solving the dyson equation is always preferable for obtaining the quasiparticle energy dispersion @xmath65 even when the self - energy has been calculated in an approximate theory .",
    "in particular , if the self - energy is calculated in the leading - order expansion in the dynamically screened coulomb interaction , as it is in the current rpa - ring diagram @xmath24 theory and in all the existing theories in the literature , then it is unclear which approximation , on - shell or off - shell , is a better quantitative approximation .",
    "iterating eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyson ] ) formally order by order , i.e. , solving the implicit integral equation for the off - shell self - energy defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyson ] ) through the standard iterative technique , we get @xmath67 we note that the leading - order iterative solution above is the same as the on - shell approximation defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : onshell ] ) .",
    "we now note that the @xmath24 approximation used in the current ( and many other ) work involves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) calculating the self - energy formally as a leading - order expression in the screened coulomb interaction @xmath68 , and as such all iterations of the self - energy beyond the on - shell approximation must necessarily involve terms which are formally higher order in @xmath28 , which would be inconsistent with the leading order @xmath24 calculation .",
    "this is in fact the argument behind the claim that the on - shell approximation may be a better approximation than the off - shell one within the leading - order @xmath24 theory . within this leading - order theory",
    "there is no obvious way to claim that the full solution of the dyson equation ( i.e. the off - shell approximation ) is necessary better than the leading - order solution of the dyson equation ( i.e. the on - shell approximation ) since the former necessarily includes only an uncontrolled subset of higher - order terms in the screened interaction whereas the latter is manifestly leading - order in the screened interaction everywhere .",
    "we therefore provide results for both on - shell and off - shell approximations for future comparison with experiments .",
    "for a given self - energy we can calculate the fermi velocity by differentiating the self - energy with respect to the wave vector at @xmath69 , that is , @xmath70 .",
    "the renormalized fermi velocities @xmath71 corresponding to the appropriate self - energies of eqs .",

    ", we take the limit of both @xmath19 and @xmath77 going to the fermi surface simultaneously . along this path",
    "the imaginary part of the self energy becomes identically zero at the fermi surface .",
    "however , taking @xmath19 and @xmath78 to the fermi surface independently gives rise to the different results and would be incorrect .",
    "we note that , while @xmath71 ( both for on - shell and off - shell approximations ) depends on the coupling constant ( i.e. , the background dielectric constant @xmath20 ) and the carrier density ( @xmath0 ) , the general renormalizied graphene velocity @xmath18 depends also on the momentum @xmath19 , implying that the interacting quasiparticle graphene energy dispersion @xmath65 is no longer simply linear in @xmath19 ( as the noninteracting energy @xmath79 is ) even for a given substrate and fixed density .",

    "( b ) , and ( c ) results for a fixed density @xmath105 @xmath89 and for different @xmath22 values ( @xmath107 , 0.88 , and 2.2 respectively ) are shown , and in ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) results for a fixed @xmath108 and for different densities ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath85 @xmath89 , respectively ) are shown in both on - shell and off - shell approximations comparing them with the noninteracting energy dispersion @xmath12 .",
    "the fermi velocity in each case is given by the @xmath69 point .",
    "we note that @xmath107 , 0.88 , 2.2 correspond to graphene on sic ( or bn ) , sio@xmath133 , vacuum , respectively . the important thing to note is that the on - shell approximation indicates very strong quasiparticle dispersion renormalization , particularly for suspended graphene ( @xmath127 ) , which may be unphysical , thus perhaps ruling out the validity of the on - shell approximation .",
    "consistent with the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , the off - shell approximation predicts rather small many - body dispersion ( and velocity ) renormalization , but it does make a very dramatic prediction about the complete failure of the quasiparticle picture for small momentum in suspended graphene ( @xmath127 ) . in particular",
    ", the off - shell quasiparticle mode for @xmath104 ( and @xmath105 @xmath89 ) completely disappears for @xmath134 ( we have checked the same to be true for other carrier densities also ) , leaving only a weak plasmaron mode which shows up for all @xmath22 values at low wave vectors .",
    "thus a clear prediction of our theory is that the quasiparticle dispersion in suspended graphene ( @xmath127 ) will look dramatically different for @xmath135 with the complete disappearance of any particle - like feature in the graphene dispersion . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](f ) we find that the similar feature ( i.e. the complete disappearance of a particle - like feature ) develops as the density decreases . for @xmath103 and high enough densities [ @xmath136 ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) and ( d ) ] the quasiparticle - like dispersion is well defined even at @xmath137 , but for @xmath138 the quasiparticle feature starts to disappear near @xmath137 .",
    "thus , there are two distinct ways of approaching strong - coupling in graphene either by going to smaller @xmath15 ( i.e. lower density ) keeping @xmath22 fixed or by keeping @xmath15 ( or density ) fixed and increasing @xmath22 .",
    "however , these two strong - coupling approaches give non - equivalent results as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "note that in ordinary electron 2d gas only changing @xmath22 is allowed to approach the strong coupling limit whereas in graphene one has one more adjustable parameter to approach the strong coupling limit , i.e. , by changing @xmath22 through background dielectric constant of substrate and by changing @xmath15 through the back gate voltage . since some aspects of this interesting physics were already observed in ref .",
    "[ ] we believe that experiments at higher ( lower ) @xmath22 ( @xmath0 ) values should lead to a striking confirmation of our theoretical predictions .",
    "this prediction can be directly tested in arpes @xcite and sts @xcite measurements .",
    "earlier theoretical work@xcite on the graphene spectral function completely missed this bizarre collapse of the quasiparticle picture for suspended graphene since they @xcite focused on graphene on substrates .",
    "we note that @xmath127 is a relatively weak - coupling regime compared with 3d metals ( @xmath139 ) and 2d semiconductors ( @xmath140 ) where no such dispersion instability in the interacting spectral function has ever been predicted .     as a function of energy @xmath141 and wave vectors @xmath101 for three different @xmath22 values , ( a ) and",
    "( d ) @xmath107 , ( b ) and ( e ) @xmath108 , ( c ) and ( f ) @xmath127 . in ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) the density @xmath131 is used , and the density @xmath132 is used in ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) . ]    to further emphasize the low wave vector interaction - driven instability in the graphene quasiparticle spectrum discussed above , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] our calculated interacting graphene spectral function given by @xmath142 , which directly provides the spectral strength of @xmath65 features in the graphene spectrum with the noninteracting result being precisely @xmath143 $ ] .",
    "the calculated spectral function in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] clearly shows that for @xmath127 , the single particle - like feature disappears completely from the graphene spectral function for @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) for @xmath105 ( @xmath146 ) @xmath89 , and the spectral weight basically gets distributed broadly over the incoherent background . for @xmath107 ( graphene on sic or bn ) , however , some sharp spectral features persist down to low wave vectors , whereas graphene on sio@xmath133 ( @xmath103 ) is intermediate in nature with sharp particle - like spectral features being present in the spectrum at low wave vectors and at high density , but disappearing at low density .",
    "our theory , which has direct observable consequences for graphene experiments , thus predicts that the whole linear dispersing noninteracting energy band picture in graphene should completely collapse in suspended graphene for @xmath147 in the @xmath148 @xmath89 density range where all the spectral weight should disappear into a broad incoherent background due to electron - electron interaction .",
    "we emphasize that earlier graphene spectral function calculations @xcite completely missed this dramatic behavior arising from the linear chiral nature of graphene .",
    "to clearly see the disappearance ( instability ) of the graphene energy dispersion at small wave vectors ( near dirac point ) , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] we show the calculated spectral function , @xmath149 , as a color plot in @xmath101 and @xmath141 space for two different densities ( a),(b),(c ) @xmath150 and ( d),(e),(f ) @xmath151 , respectively . in this figure",
    "the narrow bright area indicates the highest spectral weight . for @xmath107 [ ( a ) and ( d ) ] the single particle - like linear dispersion has the most spectral weight and",
    "well defined plasmaron features appear below the single particle - like peak .",
    "however for @xmath127 [ ( c ) and ( f ) ] there are no well defined peaks at small wave vectors and the spectral weight is distributed broadly over the incoherent background .",
    "the broadening of spectral weight at small wave vectors is more pronounced at low density ( f ) .",
    "the disappearance ( instability ) develops gradually as the wave vector decreases , and the anomalous dispersion is stronger for lower density and higher @xmath22 .",
    "we suggest that spectral function measurements via arpes or sts be carried out on suspended graphene to directly observe our predicted instability .",
    "to conclude , we have provided the detailed quantitative results for nonlinear interacting graphene dispersion as a function of density , coupling constant , and momentum , predicting in the process a spectacular collapse of the quasiparticle picture in suspended graphene for @xmath152 , which can be directly tested in experiments .",
    "our results indicate that many - body renormalization of graphene velocity is possible up to a factor of two as a function of either carrier density or wave vector if a large range of density and wave vector can be explored in future experiments .",
    "our work is a generalization of earlier works @xcite in the literature to large @xmath22 values and lower carrier densities where the anomalous dispersion properties of graphene should lead to a striking collapse of the quasiparticle picture as shown in our results .",
    "even though we have used the well known many body diagrammatic perturbation theory ( @xmath53 approximation ) our main findings ( i.e. , fermi velocity renormalization in both on - shell and off - shell approximations and an instability in the graphene energy dispersion ) are totally unexpected .",
    "especially , the disappearance of the quasiparticle features at small wave vectors as the interaction strength increases is totally unanticipated and has not earlier been predicted or discussed anywhere in the existing literature to the best of our knowledge .",
    "since the current available experiments @xcite do not indicate any signature of this instability we believe that this work is important and of interest because the results presented in this paper are relevant for future experiments .",
    "the current available experiments have mostly been performed at small @xmath22 values for graphene on substrates .",
    "so , to see our prediction of the instability it is required to do experiments with samples having small electron density and high @xmath22 value such as suspended graphene . since there are two distinct ways of approaching strong - coupling in graphene either by keeping density @xmath0 fixed and increasing @xmath22 or by going to smaller @xmath0 keeping @xmath22 fixed , the similar many body featuren may appear as the density decreases for a fixed @xmath22 value .",
    "thus , in stead of increasing the @xmath22 value we can measure these many body effects by reducing density in graphene on sio@xmath133 or sic substates .",
