    "the holographic principle  @xcite and its first realization in string theory , i.e. the ads@xmath3/cft@xmath4 correspondence  @xcite provided us new perspectives and methods in finding quantum theory of gravity .",
    "recent major advances made along this direction was began by the searching of quantum gravity descriptions of the kerr black hole , namely the kerr / cft correspondence  @xcite , together with its various generalizations  @xcite .",
    "the kerr / cft correspondence was first proposed for the near horizon extremal kerr black hole which contains an ads@xmath5 structure ( a warped ads@xmath6 structure with @xmath7 isometry ) , then the left hand central charge @xmath8 of the dual 2d cft was obtained by following similar treatment in the ads@xmath6/cft@xmath2 duality  @xcite to analyze the asymptotical symmetries of the spacetime , where @xmath0 is the angular momentum of the kerr black hole .",
    "it was later shown that the kerr / cft duality can be generalized to the near extremal kerr black hole case by studying the low frequency scattering process of external fields  @xcite .",
    "for both the extremal and near extremal kerr black holes , the near horizon ads@xmath9 geometries play an essential role in obtaining the central charges and conformal weights of the dual 2d cfts .",
    "however , when the black hole is non - extremal , there is no apparent near horizon ads structures , thus the usual ads / cft approaches do not work directly .",
    "remarkably , it was suggested that a generic non - extremal kerr black hole should still dual to a 2d cft based on the fact that there exists a hidden 2d conformal symmetry which can be probed by a scalar field at low frequencies  @xcite . for other extensions on the hidden conformal symmetry ,",
    "see  @xcite .    among the generalizations of the kerr / cft correspondence ,",
    "an interesting progress is the studying of the cft description of the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole , i.e. the rn / cft duality  @xcite .",
    "since the rn black hole is non - rotating and it only contains an ads@xmath2 geometry in the near horizon ( near ) extremal limit , to follow the method of the kerr / cft correspondence , one can uplift the 4d rn black hole into a five dimensional spacetime , in which a @xmath10 symmetry in the 5d metric appears and then a ( warped ) ads@xmath6 structure comes out in the ( near ) extremal near horizon region  @xcite .",
    "an alternative way is to reduce the 4d rn black hole into two dimensions and investigate the stress tensors and current of its 2d effective theory by analyzing the asymptotical symmetries  @xcite . like the kerr black hole case ,",
    "the rn / cft correspondence is found not only valid for the extremal and near extremal cases , but also for the non - extremal rn black hole , motivated by the work of probing hidden conformal symmetry .",
    "moreover , we showed that for the 4d rn black hole , like its 5d uplifted counterpart , its holographic dual cft should still be two dimensional  @xcite . a key observation made in  @xcite",
    "is that the @xmath10 symmetry of the background electromagnetic field can be probed by a charged scalar field , and then the hidden 2d conformal symmetry of the 4d rn black hole can be revealed .",
    "consequently , a dual cft@xmath2 description is conjectured .",
    "the result in  @xcite indicates that the @xmath10 symmetry of the background gauge field plays an equivalent role with that of the @xmath10 symmetry coming from the rotation .",
    "this is actually part of the motivations for our present paper on exploring the twofold hidden conformal symmetries of the kerr - newman ( kn ) black hole .    with the kerr / cft and rn / cft correspondences in hand ,",
    "naturally the next step is to investigate the cft duals for the kn black hole .",
    "there were some trials on this problem but the results are incomplete  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that in all the above attempts , only the angular momentum ( @xmath0- ) picture of the kn black hole was revealed , where the central charges of the dual 2d cft are @xmath11 , which do not depend on the black hole charge @xmath1 .",
    "although this @xmath0-picture can reproduce correct entropy of the kn black hole and other information of the dual cft , it is still unsatisfied . since geometrically",
    ", the kn black hole will return to the kerr black hole when @xmath12 while to the rn black hole when @xmath13 .",
    "however , if one takes @xmath13 in the @xmath0-picture , it will not recover the information of the corresponding rn black hole .",
    "that is to say , a multiple cfts dual to the kn black hole is expected , more specifically , another @xmath1-picture ( in which the central charges will depend on @xmath1 ) should exist for the kn black hole .",
    "this is another part of motivations for our present work . in this paper",
    "we will show that , there are indeed two different individual 2d cfts dual to the generic non - extremal kn black hole , based on the fact that there are twofold 2d conformal symmetries in the low frequency wave equation of the external scalar field when we suitably turn on / off the couplings . though these 2d conformal symmetries are not derived from the geometry of kn black hole background except for near horizon ( near ) extremal limits .",
    "nevertheless , they should reveal the hidden conformal symmetries of the kn black hole and could still be understood in a geometric picture which will be discussed in the section of conclusion .",
    "our result indicates that each of the dual cft gives a complete holographic description for the kn black hole , which can be described as a kn / cfts dualities .",
    "our suggestion is further supported by matching of the absorption cross sections and real time correlators calculated in both the @xmath0- and the @xmath1-pictures from the gravity and the cft sides .",
    "in addition , our work also leads to a fascinating `` microscopic no hair conjecture ''  for each macroscopic hair parameter , in additional to the mass of a black hole in the einstein - maxwell theory ( with dimension @xmath14 ) , there should exist an associated holographic cft@xmath2 description .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first review some basic properties of the kn black hole and study the scattering process of a probe charged scalar field propagating in its background in section ii . in section iii , we will reanalyze the angular momentum @xmath0-picture of the kn black hole in order to compare it with the @xmath1-picture .",
    "this section include the probing of hidden conformal symmetry , the calculation of absorption cross sections and real time correlators .",
    "then in section iv , we explore explicitly the charge @xmath1-picture of the kn black hole parallel to the @xmath0-picture .",
    "we give the conclusion in section v , and appendix a list the symmetry and casimir operators in ads@xmath6 spacetime .",

    "\\frac{\\delta \\sin^2\\theta}{\\delta - a^2\\sin^2\\theta } d\\phi^2 \\right ) , \\nonumber\\\\ a_{[1 ] } & = & - \\frac{q r}{\\sigma } \\left ( dt - a \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 the radii of black hole outer and inner horizons @xmath20 , the horizon angular velocity @xmath21 and the chemical potential @xmath22 are @xmath23 and the corresponding thermodynamical quantities , i.e. the hawking temperature and the black hole entropy , are @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the surface gravity and area of the outer horizon , respectively .    consider a probe charged scalar field scattering in the the kn black hole background , the admitted motion is described by the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are mass and electric charge parameters of the scalar field respectively . after assuming the following mode expansions @xmath30 the kg equation can be decoupled into the angular and radial equations as @xmath31 s & = & 0 \\\\ \\partial_r ( \\delta \\partial_r r ) + \\left [ \\frac { [ ( r^2 + a^2 ) \\omega - q q r - m a ] ^2}{\\delta } - \\mu^2 ( r^2 + a^2 ) + 2 m a \\omega - \\lambda \\right ] r & = & 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the separation constant .",
    "furthermore , for a massless probe scalar field with @xmath33 , the radial equation can be further expressed in the following desirable form @xmath34 ^ 2}{(r - r_+ ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } \\!-\\ ! \\frac{\\left [ ( r_-^2 \\!+\\ !",

    "moreover , the condition @xmath40 simplifies the solution of the angular equations to be the legendre polynomials and the separation constant should have the standard values @xmath41 .",
    "finally , the radial equation ( [ radial ] ) reduces to @xmath42 ^ 2}{(r - r_+ ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } - \\frac{\\left [ ( r_-^2 + a^2 ) \\omega - a m - q r_- q \\right]^2}{(r - r_- ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } \\right ] r = l ( l + 1 ) r.\\ ] ]    remarkably , there are twofold 2d conformal symmetries encoded in the solution space of the above equation  ( [ eqr ] ) . as we will see , the affiliated coordinates of the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( originating the frequency @xmath45 ) compose the two dimensional base of the apparent ads@xmath6 structure of the searching hidden conformal symmetry",
    ". however , there are two possible candidates for the fibration  either the @xmath46-coordinate associated with the mode parameter @xmath47 or the internal coordinate of the @xmath10 symmetry space connected with the electric charge @xmath29 of the probe scalar field .",
    "it turns out that each choice of fibration coordinate gives a different apparent ads@xmath6 and therefore , individual cft@xmath2 description . for the choice of @xmath46 coordinate",
    ", the corresponding field theory is an extension of the cft dual to the kerr black hole  with the same central charges determined by the angular momentum but generalized temperatures .",
    "this description , called the @xmath0-picture , has been well - investigated recently in  @xcite and we are going to reproduce the results , for comparison with another picture , in this paper .",
    "the other choice of fibration , i.e. the internal @xmath10 phase , similarly gives a generalization of the rn / cft correspondence in which the cft central charges are given by the charge of the black hole .",
    "the realization of the second description , called @xmath1-picture , is not so obvious by using the technique developed in  @xcite for the dyonic rn black hole .",
    "all the details will be presented in the coming sections .",
    "in order to probe the @xmath0-picture cft@xmath2 description dual to the kn black hole , one should consider a neutral scalar field by imposing @xmath48 as a probe and the equation  ( [ eqr ] ) becomes to @xmath49 ^ 2}{(r - r_+ ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } + \\frac{\\left [ ( r_-^2 + a^2 ) \\partial_t + a \\partial_\\phi \\right]^2}{(r - r_- ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } \\right ) \\phi =",

    ", the probe scalar field does not couple with the background gauge field , so it reveals essentially the angular momentum dominated section of the dual field theory , resembling the dual cft of the kerr black hole .",
    "the corresponding central charges are completely determined by the angular momentum @xmath53 as the first supporting evidence , one can straightforwardly check that the cft microscopic entropy from the cardy formula indeed reproduces the bekenstein - hawking area entropy of the kn black hole : @xmath54      for the further evidences to support the @xmath0-picture in kn / cfts correspondence , we study the scattering process of the neutral probe scalar field in the kn black hole background .",
    "we can compute , from the gravity side , the absorption cross section and the real time correlator which can be verified in agreement with the corresponding results for the operator dual to the scalar field in the 2d cft .",
    "the near region kg equation  ( [ eqr ] ) can be solved technically easier in terms of a new variable @xmath55 defined by @xmath56 and the general solutions , after imposing @xmath48 , include ingoing and outgoing modes as @xmath57 in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath58 labeled by the following coefficients @xmath59 there is an important relation among these coefficients : @xmath60 . actually the ingoing mode , more precisely its asymptotically behavior at the match region @xmath61 ( but still satisfying @xmath62 ) already contained the necessary information for the absorption cross section and real time correlator .",
    "the asymptotic form can be read out by taking the limits @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the result for the ingoing mode is @xmath65 where two coefficients are @xmath66 one more additional information can be obtained is that the conformal weights of the operator dual to the scalar field should be @xmath67 hence , the coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be expressed in terms of parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xmath72 with @xmath73 the essential part of the absorption cross section can be read out directly from the coefficient @xmath74 , namely @xmath75    in order to compare the absorption cross section with the two - point function of the operator dual to the probe scalar field , one needs to identify the conjugate charges , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , defined by @xmath78 from the first law of black hole thermodynamics @xmath79 one can get the the conjugate charges via @xmath80 and the solutions are and the solution  @xcite @xmath81 the identifications of parameters are @xmath82 and @xmath83 . since the probe scalar field is neutral , in such case , we have @xmath84    therefore , one can straightforwardly verify the following relation for the imaginary part of the coefficient @xmath85 , @xmath86 finally , the absorption cross section can be expressed as @xmath87 which is the finite temperature absorption cross section of an operator dual to the neutral probe scalar field in the @xmath0-picture 2d cft corresponding to the kn black hole .",
    "one can further check the real - time correlator  @xcite in the @xmath0-picture .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of ingoing scalar field  ( [ asymrj ] ) indicates that two coefficients play different roles : @xmath74 as the source and @xmath88 as the response , and the two - point retarded correlator is simply  @xcite @xmath89 following the identity @xmath60 , we can easily check that the retarded green function is @xmath90 using the relation @xmath91 we have @xmath92 moreover , since the conformal weights @xmath93 are integers so @xmath94    from the cft side , the euclidean correlator , in terms of the euclidean frequencies @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , is @xmath97 where @xmath98 the retarded green function @xmath99 is analytic on the upper half complex @xmath100-plane @xmath101 and the euclidean frequencies @xmath102 and @xmath103 should take discrete values of the matsubara frequencies ( @xmath104 are integers for bosons and half integers for fermions ) @xmath105 at these frequencies , the retarded green function precisely agrees with the gravity side computation  ( [ greenrj ] ) up to a numerical normalization factor .",
    "for the @xmath1-picture cft@xmath2 description one should turn off the @xmath46-direction momentum mode of the charged probe scalar field , by imposing @xmath106 , and the the corresponding radial equation , from eq.([eqr ] ) , becomes to @xmath107 ^ 2}{(r - r_+ ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } + \\frac{\\left [ ( r_-^2 + a^2 ) \\partial_t + ( q r_-/\\ell ) \\partial_\\chi \\right]^2}{(r - r_- ) ( r_+ - r_- ) } \\right ) \\phi = l ( l + 1 ) \\phi,\\ ] ] where the operator @xmath108 acts on `` internal space '' of @xmath10 symmetry of the complex scalar field and its eigenvalue is the charge of the scalar field such as @xmath109 .",
    "the parameter @xmath110 in principle can be any values reflecting an `` ambiguity '' in the holographic dual description of the rn black hole . actually , this parameter has a natural geometrical interpretation as the radius of extra circle when the rn solution is considered to be embedded into 5d , for more detailed explanation of @xmath110 , see  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the radial equation is just the casimir operator  ( [ casimir ] ) acting on @xmath51 with the following identifications @xmath111 in this picture , the momentum mode on the @xmath46 direction is turned off and such probe scalar field is not able to explore the information related to the angular momentum .",
    "therefore , it can reveal only the charge dominated subsection resembling the dual cft of the rn black hole .",
    "the corresponding central charges are @xmath112 and the cft microscopic entropy matches the bekenstein - hawking area entropy of the kn black hole ( note that @xmath113 ) @xmath114      as what we did for the @xmath0-picture , we are going to study the scattering process to find further supports for the duality . in terms of new",

    "the crucial asymptotically behavior of the ingoing mode at the match region @xmath61 ( but still satisfying @xmath62 ) can be obtained by taking the limits @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the result is @xmath118 where the two key coefficients are @xmath119 as like the case in the @xmath0-picture , the conformal weights of the operator dual to the scalar field are @xmath120 hence , the coefficients @xmath121 and @xmath122 can be expressed in terms of conformal weights ( real part ) and two parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( imaginary part ) @xmath125 where , unlike the @xmath0-picture , @xmath126 are composed by three sets cft parameters : frequencies ( @xmath127 ) , charges ( @xmath128 ) and chemical potentials ( @xmath129 ) as @xmath130 with @xmath131 the essential part of the absorption cross section can be read out directly from the coefficient @xmath132 , namely @xmath133 again , the conjugate charges in this picture @xmath134 can be solved according to the first law of black hole thermodynamics  ( [ 1st ] ) and relation @xmath135 . the solution is @xmath136 the identifications of parameters are @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "since the probe scalar does not have momentum mode along @xmath46-direction , in such case , we have @xmath137    therefore , one can straightforwardly verify the following relation for the imaginary part of the coefficient @xmath138 , @xmath139 finally , the absorption cross section can be expressed as @xmath140 which has the same form of the finite temperature absorption cross section of an operator with the conformal weights ( @xmath141 ) , frequencies ( @xmath142 ) electric charges ( @xmath143 ) and chemical potentials ( @xmath144 ) in the dual 2d cft with the temperatures ( @xmath145 ) .      in the @xmath1-picture ,",
    "the two - point retarded correlator is simple as well @xmath146 repeating the same analysis done in the @xmath0-picture , we firstly can easily check that retarded green function , by following the identity @xmath117 , is @xmath147 then , by using the relation @xmath91 we have @xmath148 and , since the conformal weights @xmath149 are integers so that @xmath150 at the matsubara frequencies  ( [ matsubara ] ) , the retarded green function precisely agrees with the cft results  ( [ cftgr]-[cftger ] ) up to a normalization factor depending on @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "it is a remarkable result that there are two different individual 2d cfts holographically dual to the kn black hole .",
    "in fact this is an expectable result since from the gravity side , the kn black hole will return to the kerr black hole when @xmath12 while to the rn black hole when @xmath13 .",
    "thus it is probable to describe the quantum gravity description of the kn black hole in terms of the kerr / cft or rn / cft@xmath2 dualities . in this paper , we have explored the twofold hidden 2d conformal symmetries in the generic non - extremal kn black hole by analyzing the near region wave equation of a probe scalar field at low frequencies . despite the fact that these 2d conformal symmetries are not derived directly from the kn black hole geometry , they should reflect the information of the background .",
    "the geometric picture of the apparent ads@xmath153 ads@xmath5 structure could be understood in the follows .",
    "the radial and the time coordinates ( associated to the frequency mode @xmath45 ) of the kn black hole serve as the ads@xmath2 base manifold .",
    "besides , there are two possible choices for the @xmath10 fiber to form an apparent ads@xmath6 structure : either the @xmath46-coordinate ( associated with the momentum mode @xmath47 ) or the internal phase of the probe scalar field ( associated with the electric charge @xmath29 ) , as shown in figure 1 ( this geometric picture becomes more faithful in the near horizon near extremal limit of the kn black hole ) .",
    "it is shown that each choice gives an individual cft@xmath2 description , called the @xmath0-picture for the first choice coupled to the angular momentum , and the @xmath1-picture for the second one coupled to the background gauge field , dual to the kn black hole . in both pictures ,",
    "the cft central charges are transcribed exactly from their `` descendants '' , i.e. the kerr / cft and the rn / cft@xmath2 correspondences , respectively .",
    "these twofold dualities are further supported by the agreements of the entropies , absorption cross sections and real time correlators computed from both the gravity and the cft sides .",
    "[ fig1 ]     therefore , in addition to the mass , every one of the other two macroscopic hairs of the kn black hole , either the angular momentum or the charge , can provide an individual holographically dual cft@xmath2 description .",
    "actually , it has been discussed that for the higher dimensional rotating black holes , each angular momentum can provide an individual dual cft@xmath2 , see for example  @xcite . according to our results ,",
    "the charge of black holes also shares the same property .",
    "hence , we conjecture that there should be a general property for any black hole sourced by abelian gauge fields , which could be summarized as a `` microscopic no hair theorem '' : _ for each macroscopic hair parameter , in additional to the mass of a black hole in the einstein - maxwell theory ( with dimension @xmath154 ) , there should exist an associated holographic cft@xmath2 description . _",

    "<S> in this paper , we suggest that there are two different individual 2d cfts holographically dual to the kerr - newman black hole , coming from the corresponding two possible limits  the kerr / cft and reissner - nordstrm / cft correspondences , namely there exist the kerr - newman / cfts dualities . </S>",
    "<S> a probe scalar field at low frequencies turns out can exhibit two different 2d conformal symmetries ( named by @xmath0- and @xmath1-pictures , respectively ) in its equation of motion when the associated parameters are suitably specified . </S>",
    "<S> these twofold dualities are supported by the matchings of entropies , absorption cross sections and real time correlators computed from both the gravity and the cft sides . </S>",
    "<S> our results lead to a fascinating `` microscopic no hair conjecture ''  for each macroscopic hair parameter , in additional to the mass of a black hole in the einstein - maxwell theory , there should exist an associated holographic cft@xmath2 description . </S>"
