    "a fundamental paradigm in classical many - body physics  laying the foundations of statistical mechanics  is that of ergodicity , namely the ability of a many - body system to sample the microcanonical ensemble of states by means of its very own hamiltonian dynamics @xcite . in generic , non - random quantum many - body systems , the celebrated eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth )",
    "@xcite translates this paradigm at the level of hamiltonian eigenstates : in the thermodynamic limit , expectation values on individual eigenstates become uniquely a function of their energy , and therefore reproduce the microcanonical averages . as the statistical ensemble is built in the eigenstates",
    ", the entanglement entropy and quantum fluctuations of macroscopic properties on extensive subsystems must obey the same volume - law scaling and mutual relationships as for the corresponding thermodynamic quantities .",
    "as a consequence , the hamiltonian dynamics initialized in any superposition of eigenstates within a given energy window will reproduce the equilibrium values of the microcanonical ensemble after dephasing .",
    "disordered quantum systems offer a competing paradigm to the eth one , the one of quantum localization , as laid down by the seminal work of anderson @xcite .",
    "the localization of single - particle wavefunctions due to disorder offers an example  in which the approach to equilibrium is simply impossible \" @xcite .",
    "more recent works @xcite have convincingly shown that , in the presence of sufficiently strong disorder , an interacting quantum many - body system can display many - body localization ( mbl ) , violating the tenets of eth for a part or for the totality of its eigenstates .",
    "eigenstates displaying mbl exhibit an _ area law _ for entanglement entropy and quantum fluctuations , and strong fluctuations of expectation values between eigenstates with adjacent energies . as a consequence ,",
    "the dynamics initialized in a superposition of eigenstates with mbl keeps memory of the initial state and fails to equilibrate , as demonstrated in recent seminal cold - atom experiments @xcite .",
    "a most investigated and challenging phenomenon is the transition from the eth to the mbl regime in the hamiltonian spectrum , and in the ensuing hamiltonian dynamics . if the spectrum of the system is fully localized for sufficiently strong disorder , this transition can be obviously driven by the disorder strength at any energy density . yet a generic system featuring mbl may also display a window of disorder strengths in which the spectrum is only partially localized , and spectral ranges of localized eigenstates are separated from ranges of extended eigenstates by so - called many - body mobility edges .",
    "the strongest evidence for the spectral mbl transition comes from exact diagonalization on small disordered one - dimensional quantum systems @xcite , an aspect which might prevent the accurate location of the transition point , as witnessed by the disagreement with other approaches such as the linked - cluster expansion @xcite .",
    "moreover recent theoretical work challenges the very existence of many - body mobility edges , based on rare - event arguments @xcite .",
    "another very intriguing aspect concerns the eth regime close to the transition , which is predicted @xcite and numerically shown @xcite to display a very rich phenomenology , characterized by a disorder- and energy - dependent slow dynamics . these aspects ( namely the existence of mobility edges , the nature of the dynamics in the proximity of the mbl transition , etc . ) are still awaiting for an experimental verification .     of the ( quasi-)random potential ( in this case , the secondary component of the incommensurate superlattice , depicted in the top part of the figure ) .",
    "the ( quasi-)random potential is then quenched suddenly to a fixed final value @xmath0 , thereby injecting an amount of energy density in the system which is controlled continuously by the quench amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "a sufficiently large quench amplitude may provide enough energy to cross a many - body mobility edge ( which we assume to be continuously connected to a ground - state quantum critical point ",
    "qcp ) , and to probe it by monitoring the short - time and long - time post - quench dynamics",
    ". ]    our present work aims at establishing a theoretical as well as experimental protocol to probe unambiguously the existence of a many - body mobility edge , and the very peculiar nature of the dynamics upon approaching it .",
    "inspired by theoretical and experimental observation of mbl in incommensurate optical superlattices @xcite , we focus our theoretical study on a model of 1@xmath2 interacting spinless fermions in a quasi - periodic potential .",
    "this model displays a localization transition at a non - trivial critical value of the quasi - periodic potential in its ground state , and a similar transition in its most excited state  as we thoroughly demonstrate numerically , making use of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "the ground state and the most excited state exhibit clearly different critical values for the disorder , suggesting the model as a natural candidate for the existence of an intermediate mobility edge in the spectrum . the case for a many - body mobility edge",
    "is further made by an extensive exact diagonalization study , by which we reconstruct the non - trivial dependence of the putative mobility edge on the disorder strength from the statistics of level spacings and the scaling of entropy and fluctuations .",
    "but the strongest evidence of a mobility edge comes from an extensive study of the out - of - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "indeed we suggest an original protocol ( sketched in fig .",
    "[ f.qqspectro ] ) by which the eigenstates of a given ( final ) hamiltonian @xmath3 in a selected energy range are addressed by quenching the system from the ground state of a different ( initial ) hamiltonian @xmath4 , differing from @xmath3 in the disorder strength @xmath5 . a wider quench in the disorder strength from the initial to the final value",
    "amounts to populating eigenstates of @xmath3 with a parametrically higher energy density .",
    "this `` quench spectroscopy '' method endows the study of the quasi - stationary state of the system , reached after the out - of - equilibrium dynamics , with energy resolution . in the presence of a mobility edge separating localized states at low energy density from extended states at high energy density , exact diagonalization and time - dependent dmrg clearly show the existence of two regimes of quantum quench dynamics : a regime of small quenches in which the system fails to thermalize ( verifying mbl ) , and a regime of large quenches in which the quasi - stationary state of the system shows thermalization ( revealing eth ) .",
    "most interestingly , a clear dynamical transition appears already at the level of the short - time dynamics , with small quenches featuring a logarithmically slow increase of the entanglement entropy , and large quenches featuring a power - law increase with an energy - dependent exponent . as the short - time dynamics is accessible to time - dependent dmrg studies as well as to cold - atom experiments ,",
    "our protocol offers an original tool for scalable numerical studies of mobility edges beyond exact diagonalization , and , most importantly , for experimental quantum simulation .",

    "the phase boundary between the ag phase and the ps phase is determined by the onset of droplets in the density profile @xmath27 .",
    "the boundaries between the ll phase on one side , and the ag and ps phase on the other side , correspond very well to the location of a sharp drop in the entanglement entropy of the half chain , shown in false colors in fig .",

    "a most important aspect of this phase diagram concerns the fundamental asymmetry between the attractive and the repulsive side .",

    "this qualitative feature is also observed in the estimated mobility edge for the widely investigated case of the heisenberg spin chain in a random field @xcite as well as in other disordered models @xcite . it is a consequence of the fact that , starting from a localized ground state ( or most excited state ) at @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , and increasing ( decreasing ) the energy density , localization gets weaker .",
    "this is generically understood from the limit of a classical lattice gas ( namely @xmath84 ) , which features an increasing density of states upon moving away from the edges of the spectrum ; reintroducing the hopping in the system , the latter can couple coherently an increasing number of quasi - resonant states , leading _ e.g. _ to a growing entanglement entropy of the half system .",
    "this argument implies that the maximum critical disorder strength to induce mbl is expected for @xmath85 , featuring the maximum density of states for all potential strengths .",

    "hence in the thermodynamic limit the entropy and fluctuations should exhibit a violent decrease at the mbl transition upon increasing the energy , resulting in a maximum derivative ( and possibly a divergent one ) with respect to @xmath43 at the transition point .",
    "this feature survives also in finite - size systems , exhibiting a clear maximum in the energy derivative of the entanglement entropy and fluctuations ( see fig .  [ f.sf](c-d ) ) : hence the position of the maximum can be taken as a finite - size estimate of the mbl transition .",
    "a similar reasoning can be used for the dependence of the entanglement entropy and fluctuations on @xmath5 : a maximum in the @xmath5-derivative can be used again as a finite - size estimate of the mbl transitions .",
    "these estimates ( from the @xmath94 and @xmath95 derivatives ) for a system size of @xmath54 are reported in fig .",
    "[ f.spectralphd ] , and they allow to draw a phase boundary between the extended and mbl phase which is in good agreement with the mbme obtained from the scaling of the adjacent - gap ratio .    finally , we analyze the adjacent - state variation of the entanglement entropy and fluctuations @xmath96 as shown in fig .",

    "indeed the energy difference between two adjacent eigenstates is of the order @xmath99 $ ] , and therefore a similar scaling should also be exhibited by the entropy and fluctuation differences , if one requires differentiability of the entropy and fluctuations with respect to the energy . a decreasing behavior with system size in both @xmath97 and @xmath98 is indeed observed in the putative extended phase , changing drastically into an increasing behavior upon approaching the transition to the localized regime . in particular",
    "the two above quantities exhibit a peak roughly in correspondence with the estimate mobility edge : this can be justified by observing that the entropy and fluctuations go from volume - law scaling to area - law scaling upon crossing the transition , and therefore the corresponding state - to - state variations ( which at most obey the same scaling ) exhibit their largest magnitude close to the transition .    in conclusion , we argue that our results from exact diagonalization on small sizes already provide strong evidence for the existence of a mobility edge in the many - body spectrum . in particular for @xmath45 and @xmath100 we estimate the position of the mbme as @xmath101 . as we shall see in the next section , an even stronger evidence in favor of the mbme is offered by the out - of - equilibrium dynamics .    .",

    "these results are a very solid manifestation of the existence of a low - energy mbl regime , corresponding to the analysis of the previous section .    on the other hand , a large quench ( @xmath138 ) injects sufficient energy to change completely the behavior of the asymptotic state .",

    "indeed one sees that for small energy densities injected by the quench , the entanglement entropy density and the thermodynamic entropy are radically different : namely , even if the post - quench quasi - stationary state displays an extensive entanglement entropy ( unlike each of the eigenstates in the mbl regime ) , it remains very far from the thermal state . on the other hand ,",
    "for a sufficiently large energy density the entanglement entropy density matches almost perfectly the thermal value .",
    "this is a further , strong evidence  coming from the out - of - equilibrium evolution  that the system with @xmath73 possesses a spectral range with extended states .",
    "this indication , along with the strong evidence of mbl for sizes up to @xmath128 for small quenches , corroborates again the existence of a mbme in the spectrum .    the estimate of the position of the mbme from the value of @xmath43 at which @xmath140 matches @xmath139 turns out to be in reasonable agreement with the estimate extracted from the scaling analysis on the properties of the spectrum reported in sec .

    "our finite - size limitations may easily lead to an underestimation of @xmath140 with respect to its true value in the thermodynamic limit ; a similar reasoning can be made for finite - time effects due to possible incomplete saturation of the entanglement entropy to its asymptotic long - time limit . despite the uncertainty in the location of the mbme from the quench dynamics ,",
    "it remains nonetheless incontrovertible that two distinct regimes ( an extended one and an mbl one ) exist in the properties of the quasi - stationary state . as we shall see in the next section , the short - dynamics provides an even richer palette of dynamical behaviors , with a seemingly universal time dependence in the mbl regime , and a disorder- and energy - dependent behavior in the extended one .",

    "the asymptotic quasi - stationary behavior is challenging both numerically ( on sufficiently large system sizes ) as well as experimentally ( due to decoherence and dissipation effects ) .",
    "at the same time , the transient dynamics of relaxation towards the quasi - stationary state of strongly disordered interacting systems turns out to contain even richer information , concerning the properties of particle transport and information transport in the system .",
    "the mbl regime was numerically shown @xcite and later predicted @xcite to exhibit a logarithmically slow growth of entanglement entropy of a subsystem .",
    "this behavior is understood as the result of exponentially small ( in the distance ) effective couplings existing between localized degrees of freedom ( or so - called  local integrals of motion \" ) @xcite whose excitations , activated by the quench , are nearly resonant in energy , and therefore can be communicated over the small couplings to induce entanglement . on the other hand , after a short transient particle - number fluctuations were numerically shown not to grow with time in the mbl phase @xcite . in the extended regime close to the mbl transition , on the other hand , a slow dynamics has been predicted and numerically verified @xcite to occur , characterized by dynamical exponents which are continuous functions of disorder , and which vanish at the onset of mbl .",
    "hence the mbl transition is characterized by a continuous transition in the relaxational dynamics , which has been recently verified numerically as a function of disorder at fixed energy density @xcite .",
    "since our main focus is the study of the energy - driven mbl transition across a mbme , we shall search for a similar phenomenology in the dynamics after variable quantum quenches , preparing the system below or above the mbme in the system . a first indication of the extremely strong energy dependence of the post - quench dynamics is provided in fig .",

    "interestingly , the initial state has the exact same properties in the two cases  given that , on average over the phase @xmath11 , the equilibrium properties of the system are invariant under a change in sign of the quasi - periodic potential .",
    "yet the ensuing dynamics after a quench to @xmath102 is radically different : the small - quench dynamics leads to a decrease in the entanglement entropy and fluctuations , witnessing the weak entanglement and fluctuation content of the weakly excited states of the final hamiltonian ; whereas both entanglement and fluctuations substantially increase after the large quench .    a thorough analysis of the dynamical transition bridging the above regimes of small and large quenches is provided by fig .",

    "@xcite predict that , in the extended phase close to the mbl , the energy transport is subdiffusive , namely the characteristic change @xmath161 in the local energy evolves as @xmath162 with a dynamical exponent @xmath163 which is related to that of the entanglement as @xmath164 . since energy transport can potentially occur only via collisions and without particle transport",
    ", one can imagine that @xmath165 with @xmath166 ( and @xmath167 from our numerical results )",
    ". therefore the extended phase close to the mbl transition may be as rich as to feature at least three distinct forms of dynamics ( associated with particle transport , energy transport and entanglement spreading , in increasing order of speed ) .",
    "in this paper we have proposed and numerically demonstrated a technique ( quantum - quench spectroscopy ) to probe the localized vs. extended nature of selected regions in the spectrum of a strongly disordered , interacting quantum systems .",
    "quantum - quench spectroscopy provides in particular a probe for the existence and the dynamical signatures of a many - body mobility edge . preparing the system in an initial state , which is chosen to be",
    "parametrically far from the ground state of a given target hamiltonian , allows to selectively probe different energy sectors of the spectrum of the hamiltonian in question .",
    "we have applied quantum - quench spectroscopy to a model of one - dimensional interacting fermions in a quasi - periodic potential , possessing strong numerical signatures for the existence of a many - body mobility edge in the spectrum over a broad range of potential strengths . when the low - energy sector of the hamiltonian is many - body localized ,",
    "the quasi - stationary state after a small quench deviates radically from a thermal state , and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) is not verified . on the other hand , when the quench is sufficiently large as to inject an energy exceeding the many - body mobility edge , the quasi - stationary state after long - time dynamics is found to become ergodic . in particular , its entanglement entropy matches the microcanonical entropy at the corresponding energy , as mandated by eth .",
    "even more strikingly , the relaxation dynamics towards the quasi - stationary state is radically different in the two regimes of small and large quenches : below the many - body mobility edge the entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with time , and particle number fluctuations do not show any growth ; above the many - body mobility edge , the entanglement entropy grows with time as a power law , with a dynamical exponent parametrically depending on the energy , whereas the particle number fluctuations appear to increase logarithmically .",
    "our results have a deep significance both at the theoretical as well as at the experimental level . on the theory side , we provide ample evidence for the existence of a many - body mobility edge in the model under investigation . despite the smallness of the lattice sizes we can treat numerically with exact diagonalization , the scaling of the spectral properties clearly points towards this conclusion .",
    "moreover , quantum - quench spectroscopy serves as a new theoretical diagnostics giving invaluable insight already at the level of the short - time dynamics .",
    "the latter can be studied with time - dependent dmrg , scaling up significantly the system sizes that are numerically accessible .",
    "the remarkable agreement between the analysis of the spectral properties and the analysis of the quench dynamics point towards the existence of a transition in the spectrum .    at a more general level",
    "we observe that , in the recent literature , quench dynamics is typically used to exhibit the different dynamics driven by _ different _",
    "hamiltonians , starting from the _ same _ initial state , or from a random state generated from the same distribution  this is the case _",
    "e.g. _ for seminal studies of many - body localization both with numerics @xcite and with cold - atom experiments @xcite ) . here",
    "we show that strongly disordered quantum systems offer a new paradigm , in which the _ same _ hamiltonian can lead to radically different dynamics when initializing the system in _ different _ initial states , due to the existence of a transition in the spectrum .    on the experimental side",
    ", quantum - quench spectroscopy lends itself very naturally to an implementation within cold - atom setups , endowing the quantum simulation of many - body localized systems with energy resolution .",
    "in particular cold - atom setups offer an invaluable , microscopic insight into the dynamics of the system via the use of quantum - gas microscopes @xcite , already applied to many - body localized systems in a very recent experiment @xcite .",
