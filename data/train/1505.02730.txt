    "the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite , apart from being successful in describing the low - lying levels and electromagnetic transition intensities of even - even heavy nuclei , has also been used in studying transitions @xcite between the different dynamical symmetries of the model , by changing its parameters .",
    "the model is known to possess 3 dynamical symmetries , namely u(5 ) , o(6 ) and su(3 ) . when a system possesses a certain dynamical symmetry , it is completely integrable .",
    "away from these dynamical symmetries , one would expect chaos .",
    "however , this is not always the case .",
    "a situation of great interest is the notion of quasidynamical symmetry ( qds ) , i.e. , the approximate persistence of a symmetry , in spite of strong symmetry breaking interactions @xcite .",
    "symmetry breaking can also be seen as the transition of a system from regular dynamics ( exhibited by the presence of a dynamical symmetry ) to chaos @xcite .",
    "the interplay between regular and chaotic behavior in the context of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) , has been extensively studied by alhassid and whelan @xcite and other authors @xcite , using both classical and quantum measures of chaos . in their study , they had found integrability at the three dynamical symmetry limits of the symmetry triangle @xcite of the ibm , namely , u(5 ) , o(6 ) and su(3 ) , as well as at the o(6)u(5 ) side of the triangle , due to the o(5 ) symmetry known @xcite to underlie the o(6)u(5 ) line .",
    "away from these integrable regions , one expected chaotic behavior .",
    "however , the study of the interior of the symmetry triangle of the ibm , brought to the surface a region of nearly regular behavior @xcite , connecting the u(5 ) and su(3 ) vertices , known as the `` alhassid  whelan arc of regularity '' ( aw arc ) .    the increased regularity observed in the region of the alhassid  whelan arc , as well as the locus of the arc , have been studied using several different techniques .",
    "\\1 ) information entropy of the wavefunctions is a measure that quantifies the eigenstate localization of a particular ibm hamiltonian in different symmetry bases associated with dynamical symmetries , linking it with the degree of regularity @xcite .",
    "it has indeed been found @xcite that increased localization in the symmetry bases occurs on the alhassid ",
    "whelan arc of regularity .",
    "\\2 ) the line corresponding to the degeneracy of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states within the symmetry triangle of the ibm has been found to closely follow the arc of regularity @xcite . furthermore , more than twelve nuclei exhibiting this behavior were placed on the arc , providing an experimental confirmation of its existence @xcite .",
    "later on , the approximate degeneracy of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states has been related to the degeneracy of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bandheads , its locus has been determined through the intrinsic state formalism , and has been found to be located very close to the alhassid ",

    ", a bunching pattern of @xmath0 states has been found @xcite on the arc , similar to the bunching pattern seen along the o(6)u(5 ) side of the triangle @xcite , which is known for its regular dynamics @xcite .",
    "\\4 ) the line corresponding to the degeneracy of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states has also been found @xcite to closely follow the arc of regularity . in the large boson number limit",
    "this degeneracy also guarantees the degeneracies predicted by the su(3 ) symmetry in the first few bands lying lowest in energy .",
    "this can be considered @xcite as a sign of an underlying su(3 ) quasidynamical symmetry , however its validity is limited to low lying states and to the large boson number limit .",
    "\\5 ) a line within the symmetry triangle of the ibm , also lying close to the arc of regularity , has been obtained @xcite using a contraction of the su(3 ) algebra to the algebra of the rigid rotator .",
    "this finding is related to the ground state band alone and has again been obtained in the limit of large boson numbers .",
    "\\6 ) recently , families of high - lying regular rotational bands have been found @xcite in the ibm framework , occurring even in nuclei far away from the su(3 ) dynamical symmetry and leading to increased overall regularity .",
    "the present paper offers a closer view on the quantum chaotic dynamics at the vicinity of the arc of regulatiry , without attempting to elucidate the nature of the symmetry underlying the arc .",
    "taking advantage of the new code ibar @xcite , which can handle up to @xmath7 bosons , the present study is focused on states with zero angular momentum ( @xmath8 ) , but can be easily extended to other angular momentum values .",
    "the main objectives are described here .",
    "\\1 ) to determine any energy dependence of statistical measures of quantum chaos in @xmath0 states and in @xmath9 transition strengths .",
    "this study is for the first time feasible , due to the good statistics allowed by the large number of bosons used .",
    "\\2 ) to examine the stability of the location of the arc of regularity within the symmetry trianlge of ibm with changing boson number .",
    "the ibar code allows for the first time to examine this stability for large boson numbers .",
    "the question of stability is of importance in relation to the empirical evidence @xcite found for the arc of regularity , since different nuclei are described by different boson numbers , in the region of deformed nuclei already used @xcite the boson number being close to 14 .    in section",
    "ii , the ibm hamiltonian is described .",
    "the fluctuation measures , used to study the quantum dynamics in the symmetry triangle of the ibm are introduced in section iii , while in section iv the numerical results are presented .",
    "an o(6 ) line is considered in section v , while in section vi the discussion of the results is given .",
    "in the context of the ibm , low lying states in nuclei can be described in terms of a monopole boson , @xmath10 , with angular momentum 0 and a quadrupole boson , @xmath11 , with angular momentum 2 .",

    "numerical calculations of energy levels and @xmath9 transition rates have been performed using the code ibar @xcite which can handle up to @xmath16=1000 bosons .",
    "in this section , the fluctuation measures or statistics , which are applied to the spectrum and the transition intensities of @xmath0 states , are introduced . however , before proceeding to the quantum chaotic analysis of the spectrum or of the transitions intensities , the eigenvalues should be unfolded .",
    "the reason is that the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) requires that the average level spacing , @xmath24 , of a spectrum in the limit @xmath25 should be constant , however , the ordered sequence of levels @xmath26 produced , for example from the ibm hamiltonian , forms a spectrum in which the low energy levels have consistently larger spacings than the high energy ones . in order to be consistent with the goe requirements",
    ", one needs to unfold the spectra , that is to say , modify the spectrum , so that the average level spacing , @xmath24 , is constant .",
    "the first step of unfolding is performed by constructing a staircase function of the data .",
    "a staircase function is the number of levels found below some specific energy .",
    "then , a low order polynomial @xmath27 is fitted to the staircase function @xcite .",
    "the unfolded energies , called normalized energies , are defined as @xmath28 . with this mapping ,",
    "the average level spacing of the spectrum of the normalized energies , the unfolded spectrum , becomes constant and specifically , equal to one , @xmath29 .",
    "the fluctuation measures , are then applied to the unfolded spectrum , which might have constant average level spacing , however , the spacings still show strong fluctuations .",
    "the statistical measures used for the determination of the fluctuation properties of the unfolded spectrum are the nearest neighbor level spacing distribution @xmath30 @xcite and the @xmath31 statistics of dyson and mehta @xcite . for the quantum statistical analysis of the transition intensities , the distribution @xmath32 @xcite , a @xmath33 distribution , with @xmath34 degrees of freedom",

    "after proper normalization of the transition strengths @xmath63 ( see @xcite ) , their logarithms are assigned to bins and a histogram of normalized transition strengths is produced .",
    "then , the interpolating function @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath37 is a factor added for scaling reasons , is fitted to the histogram , through a least squares fitting , in order to find the best value of @xmath34 . however , since @xmath63 is the logarithm of the normalized transition strengths , one should change the variable @xmath63 of the intepolating function of eq .",

    "@xmath79 was used , producing 54,756 possible transition strengths , @xmath9s , between the 234 @xmath0 states .",
    "the reason for selecting @xmath79 instead of @xmath78 , was that in the latter case more than 6,000,000 possible transition intensities are produced between the 2640 @xmath0 states , which renders the calculation impossible to run in terms of time , while for @xmath79 , the run time and the statistics are more than satisfactory .",
    "the allowed number of @xmath9s differs from point to point in the symmetry triangle of the ibm and this number gets larger , as the dynamics of the point get more chaotic .",

    "the fitting of the interpolating function of the last statistical measure , @xmath32 , on the su(3 ) vertex is rather poor , which reflects the fact that the expression of eq .",

    "in addition to the notion of quasidynamical symmetry ( qds ) , i.e. , the approximate persistence of a symmetry , in spite of strong symmetry breaking interactions @xcite , the notion of partial dynamical symmetry ( pds ) has been introduced @xcite , including three different cases . in type",

    ", we applied the nearest neighbor spacing distribution , on @xmath0 states , for @xmath78 bosons , at various points on and around the o(6 ) pds line , in order to see whether the o(6 ) pds line induces regular dynamics to the @xmath0 states considered here .",

    "it is expected that in general pds can lead to suppression of chaos , however this is expected to depend on the number of states exhibiting the pds . in @xcite a model hamiltonian with an su(3 ) pds has been used , in order to examine whether there is suppression of chaos on the point of the pds .",
    "classical and quantum measures of chaos have been used for three different values of the angular momentum ( @xmath89 ) and @xmath90 .",
    "minimum chaoticity has been found around the point where the su(3 ) pds was supposed to exist , but the minimum diverged slightly from this point for the two lowest values of angular momentum , while it was more pronounced and closer to this point for the larger value of angular momentum ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the same behavior has been seen for the average su(3 ) entropy of the eigenstates of the model hamiltonian , which also showed a more pronounced and closer to the point of the su(3 ) pds minimum for @xmath91 . this behavior has been explained in terms of the increase of the number of soluble states with increasing @xmath92 .",
    "in contrast , in @xcite , where a large number of states had an su(2 ) pds , the classical and quantum measures of chaos showed a minimum exactly at the point where the su(2 ) pds was supposed to exist .",
    "in this paper , we presented the application of statistical measures of chaos on the energy spectrum and the transition strengths of excited @xmath0 states , in the context of the interacting boson model and more precisely on a line connecting a point on the u(5)su(3 ) leg of the symmetry triangle with a point on the u(5)o(6 ) leg . while the statistical measures of chaos reveal regularity on the u(5)o(6 ) leg , due to the o(5 ) symmetry known @xcite to underlie this leg , the point on the u(5)su(3 ) leg seems to be the most chaotic point on this connection line . besides the u(5)o(6 ) leg , one more minimum",
    "is revealed on the transition line , located on the arc of regularity , which is in agreement with previous studies performed with smaller number of bosons and levels with angular momentum @xmath93 .    concerning the objectives posed at the end of the introduction , the following comments are in place .",
    "\\1 ) the study of chaos as a function of energy gave some intriguing results .",
    "this study has already been performed using both classical @xcite and quantum measures of chaos @xcite , but never using the fluctuation measures of the quantum spectrum or the transition intensities , due to the bad statistics imposed by the small number of bosons used .",
    "the degree of chaos differs as the energy changes .",
    "the results , both for the spectrum , as well as the transition intensities , show that the low energy part of the spectrum has always more regular dynamics compared to the immediately higher energy parts , which are almost completely chaotic . however , as the energy increases , chaoticity decreases and regularity prevails at the highest parts of the spectrum .",
    "this is the general behavior for points studied in the vicinity of the arc .",
    "however , the point on the arc is always more regular , compared to the other points , in all energy intervals , giving a confirmation for its regular character .",
    "\\2 ) quantum chaos also depends on the number of bosons used . as the number of bosons increases , the degree of chaos converges to a steady value . beyond @xmath79 ,",
    "the relative chaoticity of different points is the same , for all numbers of bosons used in the context of this work .",
    "for example , chaoticity on the arc points is less than on the neighboring points , regardless of the number of bosons beyond @xmath79 , giving for the arc a steady position in the symmetry triangle as a function of boson number beyond @xmath79 .",
    "below @xmath79 , however , the location of the arc appears to be sensitive in @xmath16 , this fact affecting the efforts of finding nuclei lying on or near the arc @xcite , since the boson numbers corresponding to these nuclei are around @xmath94 .",
    "while the fluctuation measures of chaos reveal semiregularity on the arc , they can not reveal the nature of the approximate symmetry underlying the alhassid - whelan arc of regularity , a question which has been addressed in several recent studies @xcite , but still remains open .",
    "recently , a line based on an o(6 ) pds was found in the symmetry triangle , extending from the o(6 ) vertex to a point on the u(5)su(3 ) leg of the triangle , intersecting with the arc of regularity .",
    "calculations of chaos around the intersection point show that the o(6 ) pds does not contribute to the development of regular dynamics for the @xmath0 states , a reasonable result since the o(6 ) pds under consideration regards only the ground state band of the nuclear spectrum .",
    "the extension of the present study to states with non - zero angular momentum is desirable . in this case , attention should be paid to handling degeneracies in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "study of the interplay of order and chaos has also been extended to the region of shape - phase transitions in the triangle .",
    "shape phase transitions between different dynamical symmetries , as well as critical point symmeties appearing at the relevant transition points , have been an active field of investigation over the last decade @xcite . in the framework of the interacting boson model , in particular",
    ", a first order shape phase transition between spherical and deformed shapes is known to exist @xcite , characterized by a phase coexistence region @xcite .",
    "the appearance of degeneracies within the phase coexistence region @xcite , as well as the evolution of order and chaos across the first order transition @xcite , are emerging fields of investigation .",
