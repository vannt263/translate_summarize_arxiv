    "the atlas inner detector ( i d ) , depicted in figure  [ fig : indet ] , is designed to measure the momentum of charged particles from their bending radius in the 2 t solenoidal magnetic field on the one hand , and to provide a good pattern recognition for efficient vertexing on the other hand .",
    "it consists of the following subdetectors  @xcite :    * the pixel detector is a silicon tracking device with a uniform pixel size of 50@xmath2 m @xmath3 400@xmath2 m .",
    "it provides a 2-dimensional measurement with a resolution of 14@xmath2 m @xmath3 115@xmath2 m for single - pixel hits  @xcite .",
    "this can be further improved with hit clustering , especially for low incidence angles  @xcite .",
    "the barrel part of the pixel detector is comprised of three layers of wafers , whereas the endcaps have 3 disks each . *",
    "the semi - conductor tracker ( sct ) is a silicon strip detector with 4 barrel layers and 9 endcap disks .",
    "each barrel module features two single - sided back - to - back strip wafers with 80@xmath2 m pitch , affixed at 40mrad stereo angle . at normal track incidence angle",
    ", this setup provides for a space point resolution of approximately 17@xmath4  perpendicular to the strips , and 580@xmath4  along them  @xcite .",
    "endcap modules have a similar setup but a fan - out strip structure  @xcite . *",
    "the transition radiation tracker is a gaseous straw tube detector .",
    "it consists of approx .",
    "300000 individual straw tubes with a 4 mm diameter , providing a per - tube resolution of approximately 130@xmath2 m perpendicular to the anode wire  @xcite . the straws of the trt are arranged into 96 barrel and 2 @xmath3 28 endcap modules .    to fully profit from the performance of the atlas i d ,",
    "the best possible knowledge of module positions is essential . after assembly and optical survey ,",
    "this can be achieved by two means : _ track _ and _ hardware _ based alignment techniques , covered in section  [ sec : trackbasedalignment ] and section  [ sec : hardwarebasedalignment ] , respectively .",
    "generally , for each of the silicon modules , 6 alignment degrees of freedom ( dof ) can be defined : 3 translations and 3 rotations . for the silicon detectors these are the two in - plane measurement directions , local @xmath5 and local @xmath6 along the more and less precise measurement directions .",
    "local @xmath7 is orthogonal to the first two , and points away from the interaction point . at the same time , local @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the module rotation axes .",
    "currently , at atlas there are 3 alignment algorithms for the silicon detectors : the robust alignment algorithm ( ra ) described in subsection  [ ssec : ra ] , the global @xmath1 algorithm ( g@xmath1 ) introduced in subsection  [ ssec : gx2 ] , and the local @xmath1 algorithm which shall not be discussed here . the alignment algorithm for the trt  @xcite",
    "will not be covered here either .",
    "all the alignment algorithms are part of the official atlas software  @xcite .",
    "efforts are underway to consolidate these 3 + 1 approaches into one single algorithm .    all the above approaches are based on track residuals @xmath8 , which are canonically defined as the distance between the intersect of the track with a given module and the measured hit position .",
    "the main postulate of track - based alignment approaches is that for a perfectly aligned detector all the residual distributions will be centered around zero and will have a width determined by multiple scattering and the intrinsic detector resolution only .",
    "accordingly , for the quality of alignment a figure of merit calculated from the residuals can be defined , e.g. the @xmath1 for the g@xmath1 algorithm ( see subsection  [ ssec : gx2 ] ) .    during the alignment procedure it can happen that a local minimum of the alignment figure of merit is reached while some global distortions of the detector remain , resulting in biased track parameter distributions .",
    "such distortions are called _",
    "weak modes_. some examples are `` clocking '' ( @xmath9 ) , elliptical distortions in transverse plane , `` telescope '' ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11-dependent sagitta distortions ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "they can be tackled to some extent with infinite track statistics . for some of those deformations , requiring tracks to come from the beamline as well as imposing direct constraints from an independent measurement can be very helpful .",
    "cosmic events which traverse both hemispheres of the detector with a continous , off - beamline helix can be very effective for the barrel part of the detectors , whereas beam - gas and beam halo events can be used to eliminate weak modes in the endcaps .      following the main postulate of track - based alignment approaches , the main concept of the robust alignment algorithm ( ra )  @xcite",
    "is based on centering @xmath13 , @xmath14 residual distributions for each of the individual modules .",
    "intuitively , for a perfectly aligned detetector with only a single misaligned module , this will give the desired result .",
    "however , for a situation where the whole i d is misaligned , correlations between misaligned modules are propagated by the track fit .",
    "they are taken into account via iterations .",
    "typically , @xmath15 are necessary",
    ". two types of residuals can be used : _ biased _ , where all the hits are considered in the track fit , and _ unbiased _ , where the hit of the given residual is excluded .    in the ra algorithm",
    ", the so - called overlap residuals @xmath16 play a special role .",
    "they are defined as the difference between two residuals of the same track in two neighbouring modules in the same layer / disk : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 designates the edge of the module where the overlap occurs , and @xmath19 the residual type .",
    "their advantageous property is the small distance the track traverses between the modules , which reduces effects due to multiple scattering . to profit from this",
    ", the ra algorithm offers the possibility to assign them an increased weight @xmath20 compared to regular residuals .",
    "overall , the alignment corrections @xmath21 are derived using the formula : @xmath22      the global @xmath1 algorithm ( g@xmath1 )  @xcite is based on the minimisation of the figure @xmath23 with respect to alignment parameters @xmath21 . here",
    ", @xmath8 is the residual vector for a given track , and @xmath24 its covariance matrix .",
    "certainly , this quantity depends via the residuals @xmath8 on the fitted track parameters @xmath25 .",
    "linearising this expression around the minimum under the assumption of small alignment corrections , the general solution is given by : @xmath26 similarly , @xmath27 can be obtained for one single track : @xmath28 the main advantage of the g@xmath1 algorithm is the proper treatment of correlations between residuals of the same track in different modules , and the fact that it generically can treat the full @xmath21 vector , i.e. 6 dof per module .",
    "the technical difficulty of finding the ( mathematically ) exact solution with the g@xmath1 algorithm lies with the necessity to solve a system of @xmath29 linear equations , which is inherently singular .",
    "various preconditioning and fast solving techniques like ma27  @xcite have been implemented , as documented in  @xcite .",
    "in june 2006 around 400k cosmic ray events were recorded by parts of the sct and trt detectors in the atlas surface building sr1  @xcite .",
    "468 out ouf 2112 sct barrel modules arranged in two opposite full - length wedges were read out , as well as 12 out of 96 trt barrel modules .",
    "no pixel detector was present .",
    "the trigger signal was given by three scintillator plates operated in coincidence .",
    "with a lead plate between the lower two a momentum cut - off at approximately 100mev was introduced .",
    "no magnetic field was used in this setup .",
    "this challenge was highly important for commissioning of the i d , the tracking , and the alignment .",

    "convergence was reached within 10 iterations .",

    "the combined sct resolution in the peak region improves from 65.1@xmath30 m to 35.2@xmath30 m .",
    "this compares well to the residual width expected for a perfectly aligned geometry , which is 31.2@xmath30 m , and is an impressive result given that the ra algorithm aligns only two main dof for each module .",
