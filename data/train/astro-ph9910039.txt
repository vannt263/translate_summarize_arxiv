    "the source behavior in the flaring state is characterized by frequently occurring episodes of hard energy spectrum lasting typically @xmath8 s. the prominent , relatively narrow variable - frequency @xmath9 hz qpo peak ( dark u-shaped band in the _ lower panels _ in fig .",
    "1 ) is a generic feature of the source power density spectrum during hard episodes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "using the data from our sample of flaring state observations ( table 1 ) , we studied the relation between the duration of a hard episode , @xmath10 ( determined using the hardness ratio ) and the lowest value of the qpo frequency reached ( determined from the fitting of the pds to the analytical model ) . in fig .",
    "[ qpo_dip_1 ] the duration of a hard episode is plotted as a function of the minimal qpo frequency . for all observations used in the analysis",
    "there is a strong anticorrelation between these two quantities .",
    "the dependence has a nearly power law form for durations of a hard episode shorter than @xmath11 s and probably flattens for longer events .",
    "according to the value of the slope @xmath12 of this power law dependence the observations can be subdivided into two groups : @xmath13 for the 06/04/96 , 07/10/96 , 18/06/97 , 07/07/97 and 17/12/97 observations ( the first group , _ left panel _ in fig .",
    "[ qpo_dip_1 ] ) and @xmath14 for the 26/05/96 , 25/10/96 , 07/11/96 and 18/05/97 observations ( the second group , _ right panel _ in fig .",
    "[ qpo_dip_1 ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the flux histories showed that these two groups have qualitatively different lightcurves : for the first group the transition from hard to soft state is characterized by the growth of the @xmath2 kev flux ( figure [ lc_pds_1 ] , _ upper left panel _ ) , while for the second group this transition corresponds to the decrease of the x - ray flux ( figure [ lc_pds_1],_upper right panel _ ) .",
    "in the subsequent paper ( @xcite ) it will be shown that these two groups are also distinguished by the properties of their energy spectra : for the first group the soft thermal component makes a significant contribution to the overall luminosity in the @xmath15 kev energy range , for the second group the energy spectrum is dominated by the hard component ( the contribution of the soft thermal component to the total luminosity is @xmath16 ) .",
    "the study of the spectral and temporal evolution of grs 1915 + 105 during the periods of flaring activity has shown that bursting behavior of the source can be reduced to a sequence of varying hard and soft episodes .",
    "the hard episodes are distinguished by the presence of the prominent qpo peak in the source power density spectrum .",
    "combined time - resolved spectral and timing analyses revealed ( i ) a strong correlation between the qpo frequency and parameters of the soft component of the energy spectrum ( presumably emitted by the optically thick part of the disk ) on a wide range of time scales ( trudolyubov 1999_a _ ; markwardt 1999 ; muno 1999 ) ; ( ii ) the dependence of the duration of the hard episode upon the corresponding characteristic radius of the optically thick disk ( derived through the spectral fitting with multicolor disk black body model ) @xmath17 is similar to that expected if the duration of the hard episode is proportional to the viscous time scale of the radiation pressure dominated disk ( belloni 1997_b _ ) . given ( i ) and ( ii ) some sort of correlation between the qpo frequency and the duration of the hard episode is naturally expected .    to explain the observational properties of black hole and neutron star binaries in the _ hard _ state a number of models involving the hot comptonization region near the compact object surrounded by the optically thick accretion disk was proposed .",
    "it is often assumed that the qpo phenomenon is caused by interaction between these two distinct parts of the accretion flow occurring on the local dynamical time scale at the boundary of these regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the following analysis",
    "we will also assume that the qpo frequency is proportional to the keplerian frequency at the inner boundary of the accretion disk .",
    "= 9.0 cm    in the standard accretion disk theory ( shakura @xmath1 sunyaev 1973 ) the viscous time of the radiation pressure dominated disk is @xmath18 , where @xmath19  viscosity parameter , @xmath20  mass of the compact object in solar masses , @xmath21  disk accretion rate in units of critical eddington rate , @xmath22  distance to the compact object in units of 3 gravitational radii . introducing the local keplerian frequency , @xmath23 hz",
    ", we obtain : @xmath24    this dependence , @xmath25 , reproduces well the relation between the duration of a hard episode and the associated minimal qpo frequency for the first group of observations ( fig .",
    "[ qpo_dip_1 ] , _ left panel _ ) .",
    "moreover , for several observations from this group the observed relation between the duration of a hard episode and the maximal value of the characteristic inner radius of the disk , determined via spectral fitting , matches remarkably well the expected dependence of the viscous time scale on the radius for the radiation pressure dominated disk ( @xcite ) .    assuming that the qpo frequency is proportional to the keplerian frequency ( @xmath26 ) and duration of the hard episode is proportional to the viscous time ( @xmath27 ) , one can estimate the required mass accretion rate @xmath21 using equation ( 1 ) : @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) compact object mass was normalized to the value of 33 m@xmath29 , implied by the interpretation of the 67 hz qpo feature as a signature of a keplerian oscillations near the last marginally stable orbit around a schwarzschild black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred values of the accretion rate for the observations from the first group are in the range @xmath30 ( fig . [ qpo_dip_1 ] ) .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the results of the spectral analysis ( trudolyubov 1999_b _ ) where the bolometric luminosity of the soft spectral component corresponding to a given value of qpo frequency was used as a measure of the mass accretion rate .",
    "if the qpo frequency is associated with the selected region in the accretion disk ( e.g. inner edge of the optically thick disk ) which is moving radially on the viscous time scale , then we expect correlation of the qpo frequency and the rate of the frequency change . assuming that rise of the qpo frequency is caused by the inward motion of the inner edge of the radiation pressure dominated accretion disk one can write : @xmath31 where @xmath32  radial velocity of the matter in the disk at radius @xmath22 ( shakura @xmath1 sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "integrating eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we obtain : @xmath33 where @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "[ obs_theory ] this dependence is shown in comparison with the observed qpo evolution for two observations from the first ( 18/06/1997 ) and the second ( 25/10/1996 ) groups .",
    "for the first group both initial decrease and following rise of the qpo frequency during the hard episodes are generally described by eq .",
    "( 4 ) ( fig .",
    "[ obs_theory ] , _ upper panel _ ) but with different values of coefficient @xmath35 . for",
    "the rise phase the value of coefficient @xmath35 remains practically the same on a time scale of an individual observation ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "for the second group of observations only rise of the qpo frequency is generally described by eq .",
    "( 4 ) , while the initial decay often has a more complicated structure ( fig . [ obs_theory ] , _ lower panel _ ) .",
    "in addition , an extended plateau in the time dependence of the qpo frequency near its minimum is sometimes present .",
    "this might explain the deviation of the dependence of @xmath37 on the qpo frequency from the @xmath38 law for the second group of observations .",
    "we analyzed the temporal behavior of grs 1915 + 105 using the set of 9 _ rxte_/pca observations representing typical patterns of the source x - ray evolution during the periods of flaring activity .",
    "+ 1 . for all individual observations",
    "the tight correlation between the duration of a hard episode and the minimal qpo frequency was found .",
    "+ 2 . for @xmath0half of the observations",
    "this correlation is satisfactory described by the standard radiation pressure dominated disk theory assuming that the qpo frequency and the duration of a hard episode are proportional to the keplerian frequency and the viscous time on the inner edge of the disk respectively .",
    "the derived values of the mass accretion rate for these observations are in the range @xmath39 .",
    "not all observations fit this dependence .",
    "in fact for the large fraction the relation @xmath40 breaks .",
    "it should be noted , that for these observations the correlation @xmath17 ( belloni 1997_b _ ) also fails .",
    "the temporal evolution of the qpo frequency during the rise phase of the hard episodes can be explained as a change of the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of optically thick accretion disk caused by its viscous motion .",
