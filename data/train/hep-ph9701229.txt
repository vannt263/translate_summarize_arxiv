    "an interesting problem in nuclear and particle physics is computing gluon distribution functions for a nucleus at small values of bjorken @xmath0 .",
    "some time ago the problem was attacked by l. mclerran and r. venugopalan @xcite . in their model",
    "they consider a very large nucleus , larger than a physical nucleus , which is moving ultra - relativistically and effectively looks like a pancake in the transverse plane . in that plane",
    "the nucleus is described by a classical color charge density @xmath1 .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath2 is small , which gives a lower limit on the typical scale of the transverse momentum in the problem : @xmath3 . actually , to apply successfully the perturbation theory one also has to satisfy another condition : @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the relevant transverse coordinate scale in a scattering process is small , but it should not be too small @xcite : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the typical scale of the color charge density fluctuations . in @xcite",
    "it was assumed that one has to find the classical gluon field in the light - cone gauge , treating the nucleus as a classical source , and that this field will dominate in the distribution function .",
    "quantum effects will come in as virtual corrections .",
    "for this approximation to be valid one needs this @xmath5 condition .    since the nucleus is ultrarelativistic and lorentz - contracted to almost a plane , a small-@xmath0 gluon in the nucleus `` sees '' not just one nucleon in the longitudinal direction , but in the order of @xmath7 of them , with @xmath8 the atomic number . that is an essential feature of the model at hand",
    " longitudinal coherence of the nucleus . in order to find an average value of any observable with longitudinal coherence length long compared to the nucleus",
    ", one has to calculate this observable for a given color charge density @xmath9 and then average it over all @xmath10 with the gaussian measure @xcite .    the correct classical gluon field , as a solution of the classical non - abelian equations of motion , has recently been found @xcite .",
    "an important issue is the way one has to treat the nucleus .",
    "the ultrarelativistic nucleus is a source of color charge in the classical yang - mills equations of motion . until recently it was treated just as an infinitely thin sheet lying in the transverse plane  a delta function along the light cone @xcite .",
    "this approximation happened to be not quite accurate , and leads to infrared problems @xcite .",
    "later , a solution for the gluon field has been constructed which incorporates the effects of a finite size of the nucleus in the longitudinal direction @xcite .",
    "our solution @xcite and the one found in @xcite by j. jalilian - marian et al .",
    "are equivalent , they give the same expression for the gluon distribution function @xmath11 .    in our approach",
    "@xcite we formulate the mclerran - venugopalan model in terms of point charges : each `` nucleon '' was taken , for simplicity of color algebra , to be a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "these valence quarks and antiquarks were free to move inside the nucleons ( spheres of equal radius in the rest frame ) , but unable to get out .",
    "finding the solution for the gluon field in covariant gauge , we then performed a gauge transformation to the light - cone gauge and obtained the non - abelian weizscker - williams field for the ultrarelativistic nucleus ( see eq .",
    "( 10 ) in @xcite ):",
    "@xmath12    @xmath13    here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the transverse coordinates of the quark and antiquark in the @xmath16th nucleon , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the light - cone coordinates , @xmath19 is the total number of nucleons in the nucleus , @xmath20 are @xmath21 generators , @xmath22 are similar generators in the color space of each nucleon .",
    "the classical current in a non - abelian gauge theory is given by @xmath23 , so the matrix @xmath24 can be understood as a part of the coupling .",
    "it is a matrix in the color space of a nucleon , which is different from the color space of @xmath20 .",
    "these two matrices act in the different color spaces , and , therefore , commute . the non - abelian weizscker - williams field ( [ clsol ] )",
    "is used in calculation of such quantities as the gluon distribution function .",
    "therefore , the condition that the initial and final states of the nucleons should be color singlets is imposed on a product of two fields , but not on the field itself .",
    "@xmath25 is a matrix which effects the gauge transformation from covariant to the light - cone gauge , and is given by ( eq .",

    "( [ cutoff ] ) we neglect the contribution of the `` last '' nucleon , i.e. , the nucleon ( or several nucleons ) whose quarks or antiquarks may overlap the point @xmath29 at which we calculate @xmath30 .",
    "this is justified , because if the nucleons are ordered in longitudinal direction there is only one such nucleon .",
    "the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) corresponding to this `` last '' nucleon gets cancelled by color algebra once we try to calculate the field in eq .",
    "( [ clsol ] ) .",
    "if there are several `` last '' nucleons , then we can just throw them away , since the nucleus is considered to be large and the contribution of a few of its nucleons is not substantial .",
    "the choice of @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) to be a path - ordered integral from @xmath31 to @xmath28 is not unique .",
    "one could also take a path - ordered integral from @xmath28 to @xmath32 , or construct some other expression which would enable us to perform the desired gauge transformation .",
    "in this paper we will try to understand the quantum structure of the classical field given by eq .",
    "( [ clsol ] ) .",
    "we shall show that this field corresponds to a particular set of feynman diagrams in the light - cone gauge .",
    "expanding the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ clsol ] ) in powers of @xmath33 , we start by giving the feynman diagrams corresponding to the non - abelian weizscker - williams field at lowest orders in the coupling constant . in sect . ii we will present and calculate the diagrams corresponding to the classical field at orders @xmath33 and @xmath34 for two nucleons in the nucleus",
    ". an easy and elegant way to sum the diagrams at order @xmath34 and higher orders is by applying the ward identity @xcite .",
    "we will briefly review this technique for the light - cone gauge .    in sect .",
    "iii we will write down and evaluate those diagrams giving the order @xmath35 contribution to the classical gluon field of two nucleons in the nucleus . at this level",
    "we shall see that taking the color average in the color space of each nucleon , similar to what one has to do to calculate the correlation function of two fields , is crucial for the equivalence of the diagrams and the classical field , as well as for calculating the field itself . at higher orders ( @xmath36 and above )",
    "the classical solution ceases to be a good approximation to the physical gluon field of two nucleons , since quantum corrections become important .",
    "that is , we find a limit to the classical approach , which happens to be just two gluons per nucleon .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "iv by constructing the lowest order diagrams contributing to the scattering cross - section of the ultrarelativistic nucleus on a heavy quarkonium . in this example",
    "we show that if one limits exchanged gluons to two per nucleon , all the diagrams are essentially `` classical '' , that is this scattering is described by a classical field .",
    "that shows that the classical approximation is valid at this order and allows one to use it in the calculation of many other processes such as charm production , etc .",
    "our goal now is to find the feynman diagrams in the light - cone gauge giving the non - abelian weizscker - williams field for a nucleus . to understand the general structure of these diagrams we consider a simple case of two nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "the generalization to a large number of nucleons will be simple , once we understand what kind of diagrams are needed to construct the classical gluon field .",
    "we start with two nucleons , which are ordered and separated in the longitudinal direction ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "then , expanding eq .",
    "( [ clsol ] ) for @xmath38 , we obtain the classical field of this system at lowest order : @xmath39 @xmath40    before discussing the diagrams giving this field ( one of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ or1 ] ) , we make a few comments about the way we treat the gluon propagator in light - cone gauge , since it will be very important in the calculations to follow . the gluon propagator in light - cone gauge",
    "is given by : @xmath41 where color indices have been suppressed and where @xmath42 is such that for any four - vector @xmath43 : @xmath44 . in calculating feynman diagrams",
    "one has to deal with the singularity of this propagator at @xmath45 .",
    "we regularize it in such a way that the propagator becomes @xmath46 if the momentum @xmath47 in a term in the propagator flows from @xmath42 to @xmath47 we use @xmath48 ( if the momentum flows from @xmath6 to @xmath49 , as in fig .",
    "[ prop ] , then for a term like @xmath50 we say that it flows from @xmath42 to @xmath47 . ) . if it flows the other way we take @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is some infinitesimal number .",
    "this unusual choice of the @xmath53 is necessary to reproduce the classical solution ( [ clsol ] ) from feynman diagrams .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath54 gives a theta - function @xmath55 . in principle",
    "we could regularize the propagator in other ways , for example by taking the @xmath56 with an opposite sign or by taking the principal value of the @xmath57 integral .",
    "the fourier transform then would give @xmath58 or @xmath59 . in that sense our choice of regularization is arbitrary .",
    "it is done in the spirit of our choice of the matrix responsible for the gauge transformation in @xcite .",
    "we want to reproduce the field which was obtained using one particular choice of that matrix [ see eq .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) ] , so we have to regularize the propagator in a corresponding way .    now consider the diagram shown in fig .",
    "the fermion lines correspond to the quark and antiquark in the first and second nucleons respectively .",
    "the cross at the end of gluon line denotes the point where we measure the gluon field .",
    "the incoming and outgoing quark lines are on - shell , their momenta are almost identical and in light - cone coordinates are given by @xmath60 .",
    "each nucleon in our model is a bound state of a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "the state has a unit normalization .",
    "the quarks in the nucleons are not very far off - shell , which allows us to treat them as on - shell incoming and outgoing particles in our calculation .",
    "the total transverse momentum of gluons interacting with a nucleon is small compared to the typical momentum in the nucleon s wave function .",
    "this results from the fact that the total transverse momentum of the gluons is cut off by the inverse size of the nucleus , which is much larger then the size of the nucleons .",
    "so , the wave function of the final state of a nucleon is approximately the same as the initial state wave function and does not depend much on the total transverse momentum of the gluons coming into the nucleon , since it is small .",
    "that means that the product of these wave functions is just a square of the initial state wave function , which gives us just a factor of one after momentum integration due to the normalization of the bound state .",
    "for that reason we are not going to explicitly include the wave function in our calculations . in the calculations we make in this and the following sections to find the classical field we are not computing an amplitude of a physical process .",
    "therefore , we do not require the initial and final states of the nucleons to be color singlets unless specified separately .",
    "also we do not impose any limit on the magnitude of the gluon s transverse momentum . in a physical process , such as scattering",
    ", the total transverse momentum of the gluons interacting with a nucleon is cut off by the inverse size of the nucleus .",
    "however , this does not limit the transverse momentum of each individual gluon .",
    "the only possible cutoff on that momentum is the inverse size of a nucleon , but it is very large .",
    "that allows us to integrate the transverse momentum up to infinity .    using the formula for the gluon propagator in the light - cone gauge , we can write down the contribution of the graph in fig .",
    "[ or1 ] as : @xmath61 the @xmath62 part of the propagator gives @xmath63 and , therefore , vanishes .",
    "when @xmath64 the propagator is proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "when @xmath66 the amplitude is again zero because @xmath67 , since the transverse momentum of the quark is @xmath68 ( for example see appendix a of @xcite ) . the only non - vanishing contribution comes from @xmath69 .",
    "but even in that case the covariant part of the propagator ( @xmath70 ) goes away .",
    "this way we are left with the expression given on the right of eq .",
    "( [ lo ] ) .",
    "the factor of @xmath71 comes from the condition that the outgoing quark line is almost on - shell .",
    "formula ( [ lo ] ) is similar to the light - cone potential of a point charge @xcite .",
    "it has the same normalization except for a factor of @xmath72 resulting from a prefactor in the fourier transform . performing a fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ lo ] ) in the transverse and longitudinal directions we end up with @xmath73 which looks exactly like the lowest order classical field emitted due to one parton .",
    "summing over the diagrams with the gluon line hooking to each one of the four fermion lines gives the expression in eq .",
    "( [ order1 ] ) .",
    "a minus sign appears when the gluon is connected to an antiquark line .",
    "this establishes the correspondence between the classical field and the feynman diagrams at lowest order in @xmath33 .",
    "let us try to go further and find the diagrams giving the field at order @xmath34 .",
    "first one has to write down the classical fields at this order of the coupling , which is easily done by expanding eq .",
    "( [ clsol ] ) to the next order in @xmath74 : @xmath75 @xmath76    the claim is that in the light - cone gauge the sum of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ or3 ] , together with all permutations ( gluons connecting to different pairs of quarks , each of them being in a different nucleon , not just to 1 & 2 like in the fig .",
    "[ or3 ] , but also to 1 & 2 , 1 & 2 , 1 & 2 ) gives us the contribution to the classical field presented in eq .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) .    a brute force calculation yields , for the @xmath77 component ,    @xmath78    @xmath79    @xmath80    in the calculation of the graphs @xmath81 and",
    "@xmath82 we take only the part of the gluon propagator for the @xmath83-line which is longitudinally polarized at the @xmath84-end of the line .",
    "the @xmath85 part of the propagator gives @xmath86 .",
    "the covariant part of the propagator , i.e. , the part proportional to @xmath70 , is small .",
    "the reason for that is quite straightforward .",
    "suppose we have a gluon line connecting two fermions which are separated by some distance @xmath87 in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the typical @xmath28 is much larger than the longitudinal size of the nucleons .",
    "if a gluon had a mass the interaction described by the covariant part of the propagator would be a short range interaction and would be suppressed .",
    "but in our case the role of the mass is played by the transverse momentum of the gluon .",
    "we take the covariant part of the gluon s propagator and perform a fourier transform along the @xmath88 direction . to localize the fermions we take them to have some mass . in the infinite momentum frame , for a fermion with non - zero mass @xmath89 ,",
    "its momentum is given by @xmath90 .",
    "using the condition that the fermion , after emitting a gluon , remains on - shell ( @xmath91 ) in the fourier transform we obtain @xmath92 which is very small .",
    "this is due to the fact that in any frame the longitudinal separation of the nucleons ( @xmath28 ) is much greater than the longitudinal size of the nucleons .",
    "the non - zero mass of the quark is not crucial , we can get the same result using some non - vanishing quark transverse momentum @xmath93 instead of the mass .",
    "summing up the contributions : @xmath94 @xmath95 if we perform a fourier transform of this expression and impose @xmath96 condition we obtain @xmath97 where @xmath98 is some infrared cutoff , coming from the fourier transform of @xmath99 : @xmath100 now our claim becomes manifest .",
    "summing the expressions like eq .",
    "( [ abc ] ) for different pairs of quark lines we see that the cutoff @xmath98 gets cancelled , and we end up with an expression exactly equal to the one given in eq .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) .",
    "the principle behind this summation of diagrams is the ward identity .",
    "the covariant part of the propagator of the @xmath83-line in the graph @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ or3 ] in coordinate space gives a contribution proportional to @xmath102 , which is excluded by our ordering of the nucleons : @xmath37 .",
    "one can track this explicitly through the calculations , or use the following `` heuristic '' argument . if we have only the covariant part of the @xmath83-line propagator , then the three - gluon vertex in the graph @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "[ or3 ] ) should be close to the first ( left ) nucleon in the longitudinal direction , since the covariant part of the gluon propagator can not propagate over large distances along the @xmath28-axis [ see eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) ] .",
    "then the @xmath47-line should propagate the distance between the two nucleons , so that its propagator can not have a covariant part .",
    "but , because of the current conservation this propagator contains only a @xmath103 term and , therefore , can not go backwards in the @xmath28-direction .",
    "so , once we impose the ordering of the nucleons along the @xmath28-axis this contribution becomes zero .",
    "it was shown above that the contribution of the covariant part of the @xmath83-line propagator is also zero for the graphs @xmath81 and @xmath82 in fig .",
    "we can conclude that the @xmath83-line is longitudinally polarized at its right end in all of the three graphs in fig .",
    "[ or3 ] , and , consequently , we can apply ward identity .    the way to apply it at order @xmath34",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "we follow the notation introduced by thooft in @xcite , which is also described in @xcite . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ ward ] corresponds to a longitudinally polarized gluon .",
    "the propagator for this line is @xmath104 , where the arrow corresponds to the @xmath84-end of the line .",
    "the beginning of the line ( @xmath105-end ) is just a usual qcd vertex , in our case the gluon - fermion vertex . on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ ward ] the vertex at the other end of the line , where the arrow is , is also a qcd vertex .",
    "however , on the right - hand side of fig . [ ward ]",
    "it implies only the four - momentum conservation and gives no other factors .",
    "the color factors of the graphs on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ ward ] are the same as the color factors on the left - hand side .",
    "after we apply the ward identity we get the contributions on the right hand side .",
    "the graphs where the dashed line hooks to the end of a quark line are zero , since the quarks are on - shell .",
    "that is why we do not have such contributions for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the diagrams on the right hand side of @xmath81 and @xmath82 cancel the second diagram on the right - hand side of the expression for @xmath101 .",
    "we are left with the first diagram , which gives the answer ( see fig . [ ward ] ) .",
    "so far we have calculated only the @xmath77 component of the diagrams on fig .",
    "[ or3 ] . to get a full correspondence to the classical field one needs to show that @xmath106 and @xmath107 contributions are zero . from the light - cone gluon propagator we obviously see that @xmath106 component is zero . to get the @xmath108 component one has to take the @xmath109 term in the propagator , which is longitudinally polarized at the @xmath10-end .",
    "summing over all possible connections of this line to the gauge invariant object above ( two nucleons connected by a gluon line ) we get zero due to the ward identity .",
    "note that these connections include some diagrams which are not shown in fig .",
    "[ or3 ] , since they give obviously wrong @xmath28 ordering in coordinate space .",
    "here we are going to work with those diagrams giving the classical field at order @xmath35 .",
    "we first note that we are looking for a correspondence between the diagrams and the classical gluon field taken in the form in which it appears in the gluon distribution function , i.e. , in the correlation function of two classical fields .",
    "but when we calculate a correlation function , we have to impose the condition that each nucleon is a color singlet , and average over all possible colors ( see @xcite ) . in the spirit of the calculation of the gluon distribution function",
    ", we will treat the first nucleon as a color singlet , which means that we will take a trace in this nucleon s color space .",
    "we will do this for the diagrams , as well as for the classical solution itself .",
    "then the color averaged , in the color space of the first nucleon , classical solution at order @xmath35 is @xmath110    let us calculate the contributions of the graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ or5 ] , doing the color averaging mentioned above .",
    "the lines connected to the first nucleon will always have momenta @xmath83 and @xmath111 , the line connected to the second nucleon will carry momentum @xmath47 , just as in graph @xmath112 in fig .",
    "we will keep the parts of the @xmath83- and @xmath111- lines propagators which are longitudinally polarized at the right end , i.e. , the @xmath113 and @xmath114 parts .",
    "the contributions where at least one of these lines is longitudinally polarized at the opposite end will vanish after applying the ward identity and color averaging in the color space of the first ( left ) nucleon .",
    "so , we throw away those parts of the propagators . the contributions where we take one or both of @xmath83- and @xmath111- lines to be covariant give us the terms proportional to @xmath115 , which is zero .",
    "this can be shown by a brute force calculation or by a `` heuristic '' argument , similar to the one given at order @xmath34 .",
    "finally we are left with the @xmath116 and @xmath117 parts of the propagators , which give us some non - vanishing contribution .    at order",
    "@xmath35 the @xmath106 and @xmath107 components of the diagrams are zero , for the same reasons as at the order @xmath34 .",
    "when we apply ward identity to get the cancelation of @xmath107 component , similarly to @xmath118 case , we have to include several diagrams which are not present in fig . [ or5 ] , but go away after color averaging in the first nucleon or because they have a wrong @xmath28 ordering in coordinate space .",
    "some of these diagrams are divergent , i.e. , purely quantum , but those vanish after color averaging . therefore we concentrate our efforts on @xmath77 part .",
    "since both @xmath83- and @xmath111- lines are longitudinally polarized we can apply ward identity to sum these diagrams .",

    "the color averaging is crucial , it eliminates many extra terms in the sum of the contributions of different diagrams .",
    "it also eliminates some graphs at order @xmath35 which have `` quantum '' parts  vertex and propagator corrections .",
    "if we had not imposed the color singlet condition , the correspondence between the classical field and the diagrams would not work .",
    "one can ask the question whether it is possible to go to the higher orders in @xmath33 that is , to orders @xmath36 , @xmath139 , etc .",
    "the answer is no , because at higher orders the classical field does not dominate , and the contribution of quantum corrections becomes important .",
    "we illustrate this statement at order @xmath36 in fig .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "[ or7](a ) is a typical graph which one would expect to contribute to the classical gluon field at this order .",

    "the diagram in fig .",
    "[ or7](b ) can not be a part of the classical field , because it is divergent and has to be renormalized , which is an essentially quantum procedure .",
    "so , the gluon field at this order has both classical and quantum contributions in it , and , although the correspondence of the classical field to some diagrams may still hold , it does nt make much physical sense to try to isolate it . therefore once we have more than two gluons connected to the first nucleon we can not take the gluon field to be classical . this way we obtained a limit to mclerran - venugopalan model .",
    "the classical approach is valid as long as we have no more than two gluons per nucleon .",
    "to illustrate this limit , still at the level of two interacting nucleons , we will construct diagrams contributing to the cross - section of the nucleus on a quarkonium ( quark - antiquark bound state ) at order @xmath140 , which means two gluons per nucleon .",

    "the generalization to more than two interacting nucleons is straightforward .    by diagram @xmath145 in fig .",
    "we mean a class of diagrams where the gluon line coming from the first ( left ) nucleon to the second nucleon connects in all possible ways to the second nucleon and the gluons emitted off it . similarly graph @xmath146 in fig .",
    "[ ampl ] includes all diagrams where the two gluon lines connecting the nucleons hook in all possible ways to the second nucleon .",
    "also it is understood that in all graphs gluons hook to all possible quark lines in the nucleons .",
    "color averaging is assumed in the color space of each of the nucleons .",
    "we have to prove that the graphs we drew are the only possible diagrams giving significant contribution to the scattering .",
    "we do not consider the diagrams where all gluons hook to one of the nucleons and the other nucleon remains a non - interacting spectator or just interacts with itself .",
    "those graphs would be at most of order @xmath147 , i.e. , down by a factor of @xmath19 compared to the diagrams in fig .",
    "one can easily see that for a graph corresponding to four gluon fields coming off two nucleons , the diagrams of type @xmath8 are the only possibilities at order @xmath140 .",
    "( note that now we do the color averaging everywhere . )",
    "analogously we can prove that graphs like @xmath145 are the only possibilities for three - field contributions at this order of the coupling .",
    "the fourth gluon line can not remain in just one nucleon since that contribution will be cancelled by color averaging .",
    "it has to connect to another nucleon and that way we obtain graphs like @xmath145 .",
    "`` symmetric '' graphs , i.e. , the graphs where the first and the second nucleon are interchanged in the diagram , but not in the @xmath28 direction , are either equivalent to the diagrams in class @xmath145 , as happens to that particular graph shown in fig .",
    "[ ampl ] , or give zero after imposing longitudinal ordering and applying ward identities .",
    "the arguments leading to this conclusion are much the same as those we now give for graphs in class @xmath146 .    for the graphs with two gluon fields",
    "the situation is a little more complicated .",
    "here we have many more diagrams which disappear leaving only diagrams as in @xmath146 in fig . [ ampl ] .",
    "most of the graphs with two gluon fields at order @xmath140 , which are not equivalent to diagrams in class @xmath146 , can be represented as having one gluon line , which gives the field , connected to some fermion line in nucleon number one , with the other three lines connected in all possible ways to provide one more gluon field , but not hooking to that first gluon line .",
    "now , in each of these diagrams there must be one or two paths to get from one nucleon to the other along gluon lines .",
    "each of these paths corresponds to some product of the propagator denominators . due to the longitudinal separation between the nucleons",
    ", at least one of these denominators should include @xmath148 .",
    "that is , it should correspond to a part of propagator which is longitudinally polarized at the right end , @xmath149 , otherwise we would get either an exponential suppression as in ( [ yukawa ] ) or a wrong ordering .",
    "such a denominator should be present on each path from one nucleon to the other .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the longitudinally polarized propagator , and is the same as in fig .",
    "the blobs represent some combinations of the gluon lines .",
    "each graph is of order @xmath140 .",
    "case i corresponds to diagrams where there is only one path from one nucleon to the other along the gluon lines in the diagram .",
    "it also includes the case where there are two paths , but a longitudinally polarized line belongs to both of them .",
    "the situation where we have two paths between the nucleons and the longitudinally polarized lines are different for each of the paths is represented in case ii .",
    "there we pick the longitudinally polarized line along one of the paths , without worrying much about the location of the similar line on the other path .    for case i in fig . [",
    "zero ] we can just apply the ward identity to get the diagram on the right , which is zero after color averaging in the right nucleon . by application of the ward identity we mean summation over the contributions of the diagrams which have the same structure to the left and to the right of the dashed line , but different connections of the dashed line on the right hand side .",
    "the sum of these gives the graph on the right of i , similarly to fig .",
    "analogously in case ii in fig .",
    "[ zero ] we can apply the ward identity to the dashed line . the result is shown in the second line of case ii in fig .",
    "the first graph there corresponds to the arrow of the dashed line connected either to the vertex where the two paths split , if such vertex exists , or to the quark line in the first nucleon , if the paths do not overlap in the left blob .",
    "now in both graphs there is only one path from one nucleon to another , and that brings us back to case i and cancels for the same reason . that way we include all the contributions from these diagrams and prove that they are zero .",
    "we illustrate our technique in fig .",
    "[ sample ] . in general at order @xmath140 the graphs that we consider in fig .",
    "[ zero ] can be subdivided in two classes , representatives of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ sample ] .",
    "we may have two gluons leaving nucleon number one to connect to nucleon number two [ fig . [ sample](a ) ] .",
    "there may also be just one such gluon [ fig .",
    "[ sample](b ) ] .",
    "the application of our method to the class of diagrams in fig . [ sample](a ) is straightforward .",
    "this obviously corresponds to case ii in fig .",
    "at least one of the gluon lines connecting the nucleons should be longitudinally polarized .",
    "summation over all of its possible connections on the right and application of the ward identity leaves us with only one line connecting the nucleons .",
    "this line in its turn should be longitudinally polarized .",
    "applying the ward identity once again we get zero .",
    "the diagrams represented in fig .",
    "[ sample](b ) are a little harder to deal with .",
    "the contribution in which line 1 is longitudinally polarized on the right belongs to case i in fig .",
    "[ zero ] . therefore ,",
    "summing over all possible connections of line 1 on the right we get zero . when line 1 is covariant or longitudinally polarized at the left end we need either line 2 or line 3 to be longitudinally polarized at the right end .",
    "let it be line 3 .",
    "now the situation corresponds to case ii in fig . [",
    "zero ] . applying the ward identity we end up with the right end of line 3 hooking back to the three - gluon vertex or to the cross at the end of the gluon connected to the second nucleon .",
    "we took the contribution of line 1 which can not insure the longitudinal separation .",
    "therefore , now line 2 has to be longitudinally polarized on the right .",
    "the situation again becomes similar to case i in fig .",
    "summation over all possible connections of line 2 on the right gives us zero .",
    "the diagrams which are not included in the representation shown in fig .",
    "[ zero ] can be eliminated by a similar technique . in the end",
    "we are left with the class of the diagrams @xmath146 in fig .",
    "[ ampl ] . the classical field at order @xmath35",
    "is included in contributions of some of these diagrams .",
    "the initial and final states of the nucleons are color singlets . therefore , color averaging in the first nucleon when calculating the graphs for the classical field at order @xmath35 in sect .",
    "iii is justified .",
    "there are no graphs with just one gluon field contributing to the scattering process , since we can not emit one gluon off a color singlet object .",
    "so , the scattering process in light - cone gauge is described by the diagrams of the types shown in fig .",
    "[ ampl ] , i.e. , by the classical field .",
    "if one thinks about this process in the covariant gauge , it is easy to see , that the only diagrams that contribute are of type @xmath8 in fig .",
    "it obviously is a combination of the classical fields . that way the correspondence can be easily seen in the covariant gauge .",
    "the two gluons per nucleon limit is also manifest in that gauge .    to conclude we summarize the results of this paper .",
    "the feynman diagrams corresponding to the classical non - abelian weizscker - williams field in the light - cone gauge were constructed ( see fig .",
    "[ or1 ] , fig .",
    "[ or3 ] , fig .",
    "[ or5 ] ) .",
    "we derived a limit for the classical approach , which is two gluons per nucleon .",
    "it was shown that for a large nucleus the diagrams , satisfying this limit , which dominate a scattering process are described by a classical field ( see fig .",
    "[ ampl ] ) .",
    "therefore it is possible that the classical field may be used for calculation of such processes as charm production , dijet cross - section and many others in nuclear collisions .",
