    "in the recent years , finding exact solutions of higher - dimensional general relativity has attracted much interest .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "the string theory , which is a promising candidate of a quantum gravity theory , predicts that the spacetime has more than four dimensions .",
    "furthermore the possibilities of the large or infinite extradimensions are proposed for solving the hierarchy problem . also , the production of higher - dimensional black holes in future linear colliders is predicted based on these models @xcite .",
    "although the uniqueness theorem has not been generalized to the higher dimensions yet , the studies of the spacetime structures in higher - dimensional general relativity revealing the rich structure have been performed recently with great intensity .",
    "for example , several authors examined some qualitative features concerning the black hole horizon topologies in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "this possibility of the variety of horizon topologies gives difficulty to the establishment of theorems analogous with the powerful uniqueness theorem in four dimensions .",
    "also several exact solutions involving black holes were obtained in the higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the higher - dimensional generalization of the four - dimensional exact solutions were obtained for cases of the schwarzschild and reisner - nordstrm black holes by tangherlini @xcite and for the kerr black hole by myers and perry @xcite . particularly in the five - dimensional case ,",
    "several researchers have tried to search new exact solutions since the remarkable discovery of a rotating black ring solution with horizon topology @xmath1 by emparan and reall @xcite .",
    "for example , the supersymmetric black rings @xcite and the black ring solutions under the influence of external fields @xcite are found .",
    "the systematical derivation of these solutions and some generalizations were examined by yazadjiev @xcite .",
    "in addition the richness of the phase structure of kaluza - klein black holes have been discussed . above all , the phases with and without kaluza - klein bubbles have been investigated energetically .",
    "( see and references therein . )",
    "also the phase transition between black holes and black strings are widely investigated .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein . )",
    "new geometrical structure of charged static black hole in the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory has been studied @xcite .    in this context",
    "a systematical search of possible solutions in higher dimensions   is of great significance . in the four - dimensional general relativity",
    ", the solution - generating techniques had been fully developed for the stationary and axisymmetric spacetime .",
    "these techniques were used for the systematical generations of solutions @xcite , including the famous multi - kerr solutions @xcite , since the discovery of tomimatsu - sato solutions @xcite . as in the four - dimensional case ,",
    "the development of systematical ways of constructing new solutions would promote our understanding of the higher - dimensional general relativity .",
    "using the fact that finding some class of five - dimensional solutions can be reduced to the four - dimensional problem , the present authors @xcite obtained a new class of five - dimensional stationary solutions by using a kind of bcklund transformation . in the analysis the formula given by castejon - amenedo and manko @xcite were applied .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "this method is promising in the point that we can easily perspect the property of the solution and obtain the exact expression of it .",
    "it was shown that the solutions obtained in @xcite include a single - rotational black ring solution with @xmath1 event horizon topology which rotates in the azimuthal direction of @xmath0 .",
    "this @xmath0-rotating black ring solution is important , especially when we try to find a double - rotational black ring solution , because it should be realized when we take a single - rotational limit of the double - rotational black ring .",
    "after the discovery of the solution , figueras found a c - metric expression of @xmath0-rotating black ring solution @xcite .",
    "tomizawa et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the same black ring solution is obtained by using the inverse scattering method @xcite , which has potential to produce more general solutions .",
    "this techniques was applied to the higher - dimensional theory of kaluza - klein compactifications several decades ago @xcite .",
    "recently it was applied to the five - dimensional static einstein equation @xcite .",
    "also this technique was used to rederive the five - dimensional myers and perry solution @xcite . using this technique and a matrix transformation of ehlers type ,",
    "solitonic solutions of five - dimensional string theory system were obtained .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed explanation for the solution - generating technique used to derive the new solutions in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "in addition we analyze the qualitative features of the solutions including singular ones in detail .",
    "these solutions are generated from the five - dimensional minkowski spacetime as a seed solution .",
    "although the spacetimes found here have singular objects like closed timelike curves ( ctc ) and naked curvature singularities in general , a part of these solutions is a new class of black ring solutions whose rotational planes are different from those of emparan and reall s .",
    "this black ring solution needs a conical singularity inside or outside the ring because the effect of rotation can not compensate for the gravitational attractive force .",
    "the excess angle of the ring can be represented by mass and radius parameters .",
    "when we fix the mass and radius parameters , there is an upper limit of the rotational parameter of the ring .",
    "we also study the rod structures of the seed solution and the corresponding solitonic solution to understand the relation between them . the rod structure analysis help us to find the seed solution for the solitonic solution we want to obtain .",
    "recently the seed solution of emparan and reall s @xmath2-rotating black ring has been obtained following this strategy @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the @xmath2-rotating black ring solution is generated starting from the levi - civita metric by using the inverse scattering method @xcite .    particularly in the @xmath0-rotating black ring , the c - metric representation of the solution",
    "was obtained @xcite .",
    "this representation is simple and suitable for the analysis of the solutions . in this paper",

    "we use the fact that the five - dimensional problem with some conditions can be reduced to a four - dimensional problem , which had been investigated elaborately several decade ago . as a result",
    ", we can use several well - established solution - generating techniques in the four dimensions to generate new five - dimensional solutions in a straightforward way .",
    "also if we prepare various seed solutions for each applications , then we can obtain various kinds of new solutions even within the limitation of single - rotation .",
    "the spacetimes which we considered satisfy the following conditions : ( c1 ) five dimensions , ( c2 ) asymptotically flat spacetimes , ( c3 ) the solutions of vacuum einstein equations , ( c4 ) having three commuting killing vectors including time translational invariance and ( c5 ) having a single nonzero angular momentum component . under the conditions ( c1 )  ( c5 )",
