    "from the long - standing solar @xcite and atmospheric @xcite neutrino anomalies we now have compelling evidence that an extension of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is necessary in the lepton sector .",
    "the simplest and most generic explanation of these experiments is provided by neutrino oscillations induced by neutrino masses and mixing . as is well known and accepted ,",
    "the indication of the lsnd experiment @xcite for oscillations at a large mass - squared difference can not be reconciled with solar and atmospheric data within a 3-neutrino framework . for recent four - neutrino  @xcite analyses",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . for this reason we choose not to consider the lsnd data and focus therefore on the simplest 3-neutrino scheme with the two mass - squared differences",

    "the corresponding lepton mixing matrix is parameterized by the three angles @xmath5 and one complex cp - violating phase @xmath6 ( see later for exact definitions ) relevant in lepton - number - conserving neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "it is known from atmospheric neutrino data that @xmath7 has to be nearly maximal .",
    "on the other hand , data from present solar neutrino experiments favor a large value for the angle @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "an improved determination is expected from solar neutrino data and/or the results of the kamland experiment @xcite .",
    "the value of the third angle @xmath1 is not known at present , there is only the bound @xmath9 implied by combining the results of the reactor experiments  @xcite chooz and palo verde with atmospheric data . together with the requirement of solar neutrino oscillations this bound implies that @xmath10 has to be small .",
    "the value of the phase @xmath6 is completely unknown .",
    "currently a new generation of long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments using a neutrino beam originating from the decay of muons in a storage ring is being discussed @xcite .",
    "these so - called _ neutrino factories _ are considered as the ideal tool to enhance our knowledge about neutrino mixing parameters . besides the possibility to explore cp violation in the lepton sector an important aim of a neutrino factory will be a precise determination of @xmath1 ; it is claimed that a measurement of @xmath1 down to values of a few@xmath11 will be possible  @xcite .    in a large class of models beyond the standard model non - standard interactions ( nsi ) of neutrinos with matter arise .",
    "the simplest nsi do not require new interactions beyond those mediated by the standard model electroweak gauge bosons : it is simply nature of the leptonic charged and neutral current interactions which is non - standard due to the complexity of neutrino mixing @xcite . on the other hand nsi",
    "can also be mediated by the exchange of new particles with mass at the weak scale such as in some super - symmetric models with r - parity violating @xcite interactions .",
    "such non - standard flavor - violating physics can arise even in the absence of neutrino mass @xcite and can lead to non - universal ( nu ) or to flavor - changing ( fc ) neutrino interactions .",
    "non - standard interactions of neutrinos affect their propagation in matter and the magnitude of the effect depends on the interplay between conventional mass - induced neutrino oscillation features in matter @xcite and those genuinely engendered by the nsi , which do not require neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "correspondingly their implications have been explored in a variety of contexts involving solar neutrinos @xcite , atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , other astrophysical sources @xcite and the lsnd experiment @xcite .",
    "the impact of non - standard interactions of neutrinos has also been considered from the point of view of future experiments involving solar neutrinos @xcite as well as the upcoming neutrino factories @xcite .",
    "various aspects of nsi for a neutrino factory experiment have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper we will consider from a phenomenological point of view the impact of nsi on the determination of neutrino mixing parameters at a neutrino factory . in particular we will focus on the @xmath0 channels , which are supposed to be the `` golden channels '' for the measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "we extend our previous work @xcite by taking simultaneously into account neutrino oscillations and the effect of nsi in neutrino source , propagation and detection  @xcite .",
    "we will show that a certain combination of fc interactions in source and propagation can give exactly the same signal as oscillations arising due to @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that information about @xmath1 can only be obtained if bounds on nsi are available . in view of the existing bounds on fc interactions ,",
    "this leads to a drastic loss in sensitivity in @xmath1 , at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "all our considerations also apply to the determination of @xmath1 in long baseline experiments using upgraded conventional beams  @xcite .",
    "however , due to the different production processes involved , the nsi parameters relevant in the source of a conventional beam experiment differ from the ones at a neutrino factory .",
    "the same methods discussed here can be adapted to cover also that case .",
    "a detailed numerical consideration of conventional beam experiments goes beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : models ] we briefly sketch the theoretical motivation for nsi in the context of gauge theories of neutrino mass . in section [ sec : framework ] we discuss examples of low energy four - fermion hamiltonians , which lead to nsi in neutrino source , propagation and detection . in section [ sec : bounds ] we review some bounds on nsi parameters obtained in the literature . in section [ sec : rate ]",
    "we present the framework of our numerical calculations and discuss the appearance rate in the presence of nsi and oscillations . in section [ sec : confusion ] we derive analytical expressions for this rate and formulate the _ oscillation  nsi confusion theorem_. in section [ sec : simulation ] we describe the simulation of a neutrino factory and our statistical method to investigate the possibilities of such an experiment to determine nsi and oscillation parameters . in section [ sec : sensitivity ] we define sensitivity limits for @xmath12 and show our numerical results for the three baselines 700 km , 3000 km and 7000 km as a function of bounds on the relevant nsi parameters .",
    "we also discuss the sensitivity limits if information from two different baselines is combined .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "more often than not , models of neutrino mass are accompanied by nsi , leading generically to both oscillations and neutrino nsi in matter",
    ". the simplest are those nsi which arise from neutrino - mixing .",
    "the most straightforward example of this case is when neutrino masses follow from the admixture of isosinglet neutral heavy leptons as , for example , in seesaw schemes  @xcite .",
    "these contain @xmath13 singlets with a gauge invariant majorana mass term of the type @xmath14 which breaks total lepton number symmetry , perhaps at a large @xmath15 or left - right breaking scale .",
    "the masses of the light neutrinos are obtained by diagonalizing the mass matrix @xmath16 in the basis @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the standard @xmath13 breaking dirac mass term , and @xmath19 is the large isosinglet majorana mass and the @xmath20 term is an isotriplet  @xcite . in left - right models the latter",
    "is generally suppressed as @xmath21 .",
    "the structure of the associated effective weak @xmath22 currents is rather complex  @xcite . the first point to notice",
    "is that the heavy isosinglets will mix with the ordinary isodoublet neutrinos in the charged current weak interaction . as a result ,",
    "the mixing matrix describing the charged leptonic weak interaction is a rectangular matrix @xmath23  @xcite which may be decomposed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are @xmath27 matrices .",
    "the corresponding neutral weak interactions are described by a non - trivial matrix  @xcite @xmath28    in such models non - standard interactions of neutrinos with matter arise from the non - trivial structures of the charged and neutral weak currents .",
    "note , however , that the smallness of neutrino mass , which follows due to the seesaw mechanism @xmath29 and the condition @xmath30 implies that the magnitude of neutrino nsi is expected to be negligible .",
    "however this need not be so in general .",
    "for example , since the number @xmath31 of @xmath13 singlets is arbitrary , one may consider models with majorana neutrinos based on _ any value _ of @xmath31 .",
    "one can therefore extend the lepton sector of the @xmath32 theory by adding a set of _ two _ 2-component isosinglet neutral fermions , denoted @xmath33 and @xmath34 , in each generation @xcite .",
    "in such @xmath35 models one can consider the @xmath36 mass matrix  @xcite @xmath37 ( in the basis @xmath38 ) .",
    "the majorana masses for the neutrinos are determined from @xmath39 in the limit @xmath40 the exact lepton number symmetry is recovered and neutrinos become massless  @xcite .",
    "this provides an elegant way to generate neutrino masses without a super - heavy scale and automatically allows one to enhance the magnitude of neutrino nsi strengths by avoiding the constraints which arise from the smallness of neutrino masses presently indicated by the oscillation interpretation of solar and atmospheric neutrino data .    the propagation of the light neutrinos is effectively described by a truncated mixing matrix @xmath25 which is not unitary",
    "this may lead to oscillation effects in matter , even if neutrinos were massless  @xcite .",
    "they maybe be resonant and therefore important in supernovae matter @xcite .",
    "the strength of nsi is hence unrestricted by the magnitude of neutrino masses , only by universality limits , and may be large , at the few per cent level",
    ". the phenomenological implications of these models have been widely investigated  @xcite .    an alternative way to induce neutrino",
    "nsi is in the context of the most general low - energy super - symmetry model , without r - parity conservation  @xcite .",
    "in addition to bilinear violation @xcite one may also have trilinear @xmath41 violating couplings in the super - potential @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are ( chiral ) super - fields which contain the usual lepton and quark @xmath45 doublets and singlets , respectively , and @xmath46 are generation indices .",
    "the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lq ] ) give rise at low energy to the following four - fermion effective lagrangian for neutrinos interactions with @xmath47-quark including @xmath48 where the parameters @xmath49 represent the strength of the effective interactions normalized to the fermi constant @xmath50 .",
    "one can identify explicitly , for example , the following _ non - standard _ flavor - conserving nsi couplings @xmath51 and the fc coupling @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the masses of the exchanged squarks and @xmath54 denotes @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the existence of effective neutral current interactions contributing to the neutrino scattering off @xmath47-quarks in matter , provides new flavor - conserving as well as flavor - changing terms for the matter potentials of neutrinos .",
    "such nsi are directly relevant for solar and atmospheric neutrino propagation @xcite .    clearly , such neutrino nsi are accompanied by non - zero neutrino masses . in fact one",
    "has a hybrid model for neutrino masses in which the atmospheric scale arises at the tree level while the solar neutrino scale is induced by loops which involve directly the nsi coefficients in ( [ eq : lq ] ) .",
    "this way one obtains the co - existence of oscillations as well as nsi of neutrinos .",
    "the relative importance of nsi and oscillation features is parameter - dependent .",
    "an alternative variant of the above scheme is provided by some radiative models of neutrino masses such as the one discussed in  @xcite . in all such models nsi",
    "may arise from scalar interactions .",
    "finally , we mention that unification provides an alternative and elegant way to induce neutrino nsi .",
    "for example unified super - symmetric models lead to nsi as a result of super - symmetric scalar lepton non - diagonal vertices induced by renormalization group evolution  @xcite . in the special case of @xmath56 the nsi may exist without neutrino mass . in @xmath15 neutrino masses",
    "co - exist with neutrino nsi .",
    "in what follows we shall investigate the interplay of nsi - induced and neutrino - mass - induced ( oscillation - induced ) conversion of neutrinos at a neutrino factory and on how it can vitiate the , otherwise very precise , determination of neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "in this section we consider in some detail the simplest examples of effective low energy hamiltonians , which lead to nsi in the source ( @xmath57 ) , propagation ( @xmath58 ) and detection ( @xmath18 ) of neutrinos in a neutrino factory experiment .    in such an experiment neutrinos",
    "are produced by the decay of the stored muons @xmath59 and the charge conjugated process . in the sm",

    "appearance channel and hence , we are interested only in the neutrino produced together with the positron ( or the electron , for the charge conjugated processes )",
    ". more generally , also processes @xmath63 with an arbitrary flavor combination @xmath64 may occur . in this case",
    "the final state in the source can be different from the one in the sm .",
    "such additional processes must be added incoherently to obtain the transition rate defined later in eq .",

    "the important observation is that none of the three parameters ( @xmath168 ) relevant for the @xmath104 channel appears .",
    "therefore , no additional information on these parameters can be obtained by considering the disappearance channel .",

    "( [ coeff ] ) it is easy to check that if the relation @xmath174 holds , oscillations are indistinguishable from nsi .",

    "we consider a magnetized iron calorimeter with a mass of @xmath180 . the neutrino detection threshold is set to 4 gev",

    "we do not include any backgrounds , efficiencies and errors in the particle identification . the amplitude @xmath182 describing the neutrino propagation is obtained by numerically solving the neutrino evolution equation with the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) , using the average matter density along each baseline . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that this is an excellent approximation as long as the baseline is shorter than approximately @xmath183 , _ i.e. _  as long as it does not cross the core . then the transition rate eq .",

    "( [ chi2 ] ) is zero and occurs at @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , the allowed region at the cl @xmath198 is given by the set of all points in @xmath195 which fulfill @xmath199 where @xmath200 is determined by a @xmath193-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom .",
    "for simplicity we consider only starting values with @xmath201 , _ i.e. _  pure oscillations .",

    "we show the lines with the same total event rates ( solid for neutrinos , dashed for anti - neutrinos ) as in the starting point .",
    "the general shape of these lines can immediately be understood from eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) .",
    "the small regions delimited by the dark solid lines arise from a global fit procedure including also the information on the spectra with the expected energy resolution as described above .",
    "one notices that these confidence regions follow closely the intersection of the lines of constant rates for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "this means that most information is obtained from simultaneously taking into account neutrino and anti - neutrino rates  @xcite .",
    "this follows from the fact that the allowed regions extend as long as the lines of constant neutrino and anti - neutrino rate are close to each other , _",
    "i.e.  both _ rates are similar to the ones in the test point .",
    "we conclude that it is important to run the neutrino factory in both polarities .",
    "on the other hand we learn that most of the information is contained in the total rates ; the spectral information is not very important : our results are rather insensitive to variations of the number of energy bins and of the energy resolution assumed .",
    "solutions in the @xmath205 plane of the type as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : th13 ] _ always _ exist , irrespective of the starting value @xmath204 .",
    "this is a consequence of the confusion theorem we have presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : confusion ] .",
    "however , the magnitude of the required nsi parameters @xmath178 and @xmath159 strongly depends on the size of @xmath204 as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ s13rel ] ) or fig .",
    "[ fig : th13 ] .",
    "thus , _ it is only possible to derive a limit on @xmath188 if there is a limit on @xmath178 and/or @xmath159 _ ; a neutrino factory can only test a certain value of @xmath188 if the values of @xmath178 and/or @xmath159 , which lead to the same signal , are ruled out by some other measurement . in fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] we show the attainable sensitivity limit on @xmath188 as a function of different limits on the nsi parameters ( the present estimated nsi limits are indicated by the solid horizontal lines ) .",
    "we define this sensitivity on @xmath188 in the following way . for a dense grid of starting values @xmath204 in the range @xmath206",
    "we calculate the 90% cl allowed region in the @xmath205 plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : th13 ] . for each value of @xmath204",
    "we show the minimum value of @xmath207 ( left panel ) , @xmath208 ( middle panel ) or @xmath209 ( right panel ) inside this allowed region .",
    "the neutrino factory is sensitive to this value of @xmath188 only if there is a bound on this nsi parameter ( combination of parameters ) , which is smaller than this minimum value .",
    "any experiment ( _ e.g. _  like a near detector at a neutrino factory ) trying to measure @xmath178 and @xmath159 will only restrict a certain combination of the nsi parameters in the source and the detector used in this particular experiment ( see eq .",
    "( [ ratend ] ) ) . in general",
    "it will be very difficult to translate such a result into a bound on @xmath178 , and even more difficult on @xmath159 , in a model - independent way .",
    "it is however to be expected that the constrained combination depends on the square of the nsi parameters since the transition rate @xmath210 .",
    "therefore we show the results for the three simple functions @xmath211 and @xmath212 as mentioned above .",
    "the left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] shows the sensitivity limit if there is a bound on @xmath207 and all values of @xmath178 are allowed .",
    "it seems very difficult to obtain such a bound in a model - independent way , because it is not possible to probe directly the nsi parameters relevant in neutrino propagation . as recently stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite in general it is not possible to use bounds on similar processes involving charged leptons .",
    "moreover , many different processes may contribute to @xmath159 ( see eq .",
    "( [ defep ] ) ) . in the middle panel",
    "we show the sensitivity limits for a bound on @xmath208 and all values allowed for @xmath159 , which is probably the most realistic case because it should be possible to constrain @xmath178 with a near detector setup . in the right hand panel we display the optimal situation , if a bound on the combination @xmath213 is available .",
    "the diagonal solid line in fig .  [ fig : single ] shows the theoretical bound implied by the oscillation ",
    "nsi confusion theorem eqs .",
    "( [ epsrel ] ) and ( [ s13rel ] ) .",
    "this bound corresponds to the best possible situation , which can be achieved only for large values of @xmath188 due to large event numbers . for smaller values of @xmath188",
    "the realistic bound gets worse because of statistical limitations due to small event numbers .",
    "the numerical differences between the three plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] is due to the different symmetries of the used function of @xmath178 and @xmath159 with respect to the symmetry of the allowed regions in the @xmath214 plane . for small values of @xmath213 ( right panel )",
    "the bounds converge to the sensitivity limits obtained without taking into account nsi  @xcite .",
    "the range of these limits for the three different baselines is shown as the gray vertical band .",
    "we can understand the behavior of the sensitivity limits in fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] by considering the allowed regions in the @xmath214 plane for different baselines , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bases ] . for small baselines",
    "the allowed region is roughly a circle .",
    "therefore a bound on an individual @xmath159 or @xmath178 is useless for a sensitive determination of @xmath188 ( see left and middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] ) .",
    "we conclude that if only a baseline of 700 km is available it is mandatory to establish solid bounds on _ both _ nsi parameters .",
    "however , a bound on @xmath209 is most suitable for small baselines and in this case @xmath215 km can do even better than longer baselines ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] ) . for",
    "longer baselines the allowed regions in the @xmath214 plane become smaller ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bases ] ) and hence , also a bound on an individual nsi parameter is useful .    with the solid horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] we illustrate the order of magnitude of current bounds on nsi parameters . for @xmath159 we show the bound given in eq .",
    "( [ boundsq ] ) , while for the @xmath178 case we use the bound given in eq .",
    "( [ boundslep ] ) .",
    "it is clearly visible that using even these rather optimistic bounds on the relevant nsi parameters the sensitivity of a neutrino factory is at its best @xmath216  compared to @xmath217 - in the absence of any nsi .",
    "the sensitivity is deteriorated by two orders of magnitude for all baselines .",
    "let us stress again that we are _ not _ using the bounds from eqs .",
    "( [ boundsq ] ) and ( [ boundslep ] ) in our analysis because they are derived under some model - dependent assumptions from non - neutrino processes .",
    "the horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] should merely `` guide - the - eye '' in reading the plots , they simply give a rough idea of the order of magnitude of existing bounds .",
    "the geometry of the currently discussed muon storage rings offers the striking possibility to illuminate two detectors at different baselines with neutrinos from one neutrino factory . with this in mind , let us investigate to which extent the sensitivities for @xmath188 can be improved by combining the information of two baselines . from fig .",
    "[ fig : bases ] we find that although the shape of the allowed regions in the @xmath214 plane is very different for different baselines , they all have a common intersection .",
    "moreover , considering the lines in the @xmath214 plane which have the same event rates as the starting value @xmath204 ( shown as gray solid lines for neutrinos and gray dashed lines for anti - neutrinos ) we observe that all iso - rate lines meet in a single point .",
    "this is again due to our oscillation ",
    "nsi confusion theorem : eqs .",
    "( [ epsrel ] ) and ( [ s13rel ] ) do not depend on the baseline .",
    "thus even the combination of baselines can not lift this degeneracy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : double ] we show sensitivity limits for @xmath188 obtained as before , but now we use the sum of the @xmath193-functions eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) for two different baselines . in comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] we observe that the theoretical bound can now be achieved somewhat easier .",
    "however , in contrast to the case considered in our previous work  @xcite , where only nsi with the earth matter are taken into account , in our present more realistic situation including also effects in the neutrino source even a combination of baselines does not resolve the confusion problem . with the current bounds on the relevant nsi parameters",
    "the sensitivity is @xmath218 , which coincides with the sensitivity obtained at a single baseline .",
    "again this sensitivity is two orders of magnitude worse than without nsi .",
    "in this paper we have considered the impact of non - standard neutrino interactions on the determination of neutrino mixing parameters at a neutrino factory . in particular",
    "we have focused on the so - called `` golden channels '' for the measurement of @xmath1 , namely the @xmath0 channels .",
    "we have extended our previous work @xcite by taking into account both the effects of neutrino oscillations as well as the effect of nsi at the neutrino source , propagation and detection  @xcite . within a very good approximation",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated how a certain combination of fc interactions in source and propagation can produce exactly the same signal as would be expected from oscillations arising due to @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that information about @xmath1 can only be obtained if bounds on nsi parameters are available and that all one can achieve at a neutrino factory is a _ correlated oscillation ",
    "nsi study_. in view of the current estimates of the bounds on fc interactions , this leads to a drastic loss in sensitivity in @xmath1 , at least two orders of magnitude .    in order to improve the situation it is mandatory to obtain better bounds on @xmath178 and @xmath159 at the @xmath219 level , which is several orders of magnitude more stringent than current limits",
    "this unexpected complication should be taken into account in the design of a neutrino factory .",
    "on the other hand , a neutrino factory may also offer the possibility to obtain these very stringent limits on the nsi parameters . using a small near detector ( @xmath220 ) with very good particle identification for taus",
    "it would be possible to restrict the @xmath221 down to @xmath222 .",
    "since @xmath223 this translates into a bound for @xmath219  @xcite .",
    "thus the near site physics program of a neutrino factory is a necessary and very important part of the long baseline program .",

    "<S> most neutrino mass theories contain non - standard interactions ( nsi ) of neutrinos which can be either non - universal ( nu ) or flavor - changing ( fc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study the impact of such interactions on the determination of neutrino mixing parameters at a neutrino factory using the so - called `` golden channels '' @xmath0 for the measurement of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a certain combination of fc interactions in neutrino source and earth matter can give exactly the same signal as oscillations arising due to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that information about @xmath1 can only be obtained if bounds on nsi are available . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the existing bounds on fc interactions , this leads to a drastic loss in sensitivity in @xmath1 , at least two orders of magnitude . a near detector at a neutrino factory offers the possibility to obtain stringent bounds on some nsi parameters . </S>",
    "<S> such near site detector constitutes an essential ingredient of a neutrino factory and a necessary step towards the determination of @xmath1 and subsequent study of leptonic cp violation . </S>"
