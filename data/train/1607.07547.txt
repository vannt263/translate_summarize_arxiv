    "to continuous introduction of mobile devices and services , future cellular systems are facing a significantly increased number of mobile devices requesting large data volume . to accommodate such a large growth of mobile devices , there are active researches on the 5th generation ( 5 g ) cellular system .",
    "new targets for the 5 g cellular system are to support latency - sensitive applications such as tactile internet @xcite and low energy consumption for machine - type communication ( mtc ) @xcite or the internet of things ( iot ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a cellular system can not achieve the two targets simultaneously , but a non - trivial tradeoff can exist .",
    "although this tradeoff is very important to 5 g cellular system designers , related researches are rare .",
    "this is because it is often hard to deal with the latency and the energy consumption analytically so that intensive simulation - based network plannings are widely spread @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , this approach becomes impractical when the network components , such as the number of users and bs antennas are scaled up .",
    "more viable approach is to analyze the network .",
    "this paper mainly concentrates on the analysis about the tradeoff between the latency and the energy consumption in a promising 5 g cellular system .    in 5 g cellular systems ,",
    "there has been great interest to a large - scale antenna system ( lsas ) , a.k.a .",
    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) , in which very large number of antennas are equipped at a base station ( bs ) to serve many users simultaneously @xcite .",
    "its inherent merits come from massive spatial dimensions , which include i ) generating sharp beams for intended users to improve spectral efficiency by suppressing unintended interference @xcite , @xcite , ii ) reducing transmit energy while guaranteeing quality of service ( qos ) @xcite , and iii ) allowing a complexity - efficient transceiver algorithm @xcite . in order to achieve such advantages ,",
    "an appropriate channel state information ( csi ) acquisition process is essential . to acquire csi ,",
    "a widely - accepted approach is the training - based transmission in which a frame is divided into two phases : one is the training phase , in which users transmit known training signals and the bs estimates the csi , and the other is the data transmission phase , in which the users transmit information - bearing signals and the bs extracts the information by utilizing the estimated csi .",
    "even if the training - based transmission is not optimal in information - theoretic point of view , it gives an efficient way to acquire the csi as well as to provide the optimal degrees of freedom in the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime @xcite .    in order to analyze the latency in the training - based lsas ,",
    "it is necessary to optimize the user scheduling policy as well as the resource allocation under reasonable and practical constraints .",
    "if this optimization is not performed , it often gives an inappropriate cellular system design .",
    "the optimization of the training - based transmission is firstly investigated by hassibi and hochwald @xcite .",
    "they consider the mimo point - to - point channel with a capacity - approaching transmitter / receiver pair and successfully derive the optimal system parameters as a function of snr and other parameters .",
    "later , this results are extended to the mimo broadcast channel @xcite , multiple access channel @xcite , relay channel @xcite , and interference channel @xcite .",
    "however , these works optimize the energy and time dedicated to the training phase only under a given user set so that it can not be directly applied to the latency - energy tradeoff in the lsas . in order to evaluate the latency of the lsas ,",
    "it is necessary to further optimize those variables under the optimal scheduling policy .",
    "the scheduling policies to minimize the latency ( or delay ) under a minimum rate constraint or to maximize spectral efficiency under a maximum latency constraint have been widely investigated in literature under various system models . in @xcite",
    ", the system average delay is optimized by using combined energy / rate control under average symbol - energy constraints . in @xcite ,",
    "delay - optimal energy and subcarrier allocation is proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the energy minimizing scheduler , by adapting energy and rate based on the queue and channel state is proposed .",
    "however , most of them assume perfect csi at transmitter and receiver so that it often overestimates the network - wise performance .",
    "also , their scheduling policies are too complicated to be analyzed for providing an intuitive insight on the network - wise performance .",
    "thus , a practically optimal scheduling policy for the training - based lsas is needed and an intuitive analysis is desired to provide an insight on the latency - energy tradeoff in the lsas .",
    "decreasing the latency in the lsas is closely related to increasing the spectral efficiency , because higher spectral efficiency results in a smaller transmission completion time if the number of users and their rate constraints are given .",
    "in addition , the spectral efficiency of a multiple - access channel with @xmath1 bs antennas and @xmath10 scheduled users is asymptotically expressed as @xmath11 as @xmath12 , which implies that the spectral efficiency can be enhanced by scheduling users as many as possible in the lsas .",
    "however , most literature assumes that _ orthogonal _ pilots are allocated to users so that the maximum number of scheduled users is limited by the number of available pilots in practice .",
    "actually , there is no reason that orthogonal pilots are optimal for the latency - energy tradeoff so that it is natural to consider _ non - orthogonal _ pilots in general .",
    "there are a few results related to the case using non - orthogonal pilots . in @xcite ,",
    "optimal non - orthogonal pilots for minimizing channel estimation error are derived and it turns out that finding the optimal non - orthogonal pilots is equivalent to solving the grassmannian subspace packing problem . in @xcite ,",
    "an iterative algorithm is proposed to find optimal non - orthogonal pilots for maximizing the number of users with a minimum rate constraint in a downlink lsas .",
    "however , they still do not address the effect of the non - orthogonal pilots on the latency and it would be very interesting to find whether the use of non - orthogonal pilots can reduce the latency and when and how much reduction can be obtained over the case of using orthogonal pilots .    in this paper , we are interested in an uplink training - based lsas serving many users with an average energy constraint , in which each user has a limited average energy for transmitting a frame . in addition , we assume a block rayleigh fading model and a practical receiver such as the maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) or the zero - forcing ( zf ) receiver and focus on the resource allocation and multiple access strategy ( to be specific , pilot allocation , user grouping and scheduling , and energy allocation ) . the main target of this paper is to address the following question : * _ how much time is needed for guaranteeing the minimum throughput to all users in the uplink training - based lsas ? _ * it is , in general , hard to address this question analytically so that we look into the two asymptotic regimes , high and low energy regimes and successfully derive the effect on the network latency according to the energy consumption .    the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * we optimize the uplink scheduling policy for minimizing the latency with guaranteeing the minimum rate constraint .",
    "the optimizing variables are the scheduling groups in which users are simultaneously scheduled , the scheduling portion indicating how often each scheduling group actually transmits , and the energy allocation indicating how much portion of energy is dedicated to the training phase .",
    "this problem is transformed into an equivalent problem of maximizing the spectral efficiency with the rate constraint .",
    "the optimal scheduling policy is obtained by solving the binary integer programming ( bip ) and it is proved that the optimal solution of the original bip can be obtained by a linear programming relaxation with a polynomial - time complexity . * we investigate the asymptotic performance of the proposed optimal uplink scheduling policy for a large number of users .",
    "we derive a simple close - form expression for the asymptotic network latency and find the optimal parameters for the proposed optimal uplink scheduling policy . then , we identify four operating regimes of the training - based lsas according to the growth or decay rate of the average received signal quality , @xmath0 , and the number of bs antennas , @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that orthogonal pilot sequences are optimal only when the average received signal quality is sufficiently good and the number of bs antennas is not - so - large . in other regimes , it turns out that non - orthogonal pilot sequences become optimal .",
    "in fact , the use of non - orthogonal pilots can reduce the network latency by a factor of @xmath6 when the received signal quality is quite poor ( @xmath4 ) or by a factor of @xmath7 when the received signal quality is sufficiently good ( @xmath8 ) and the number of bs antennas is sufficiently large ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "this regime can be interpreted as the scenario that each bs equipped with a very large number of antennas serves users with limited transmit energy in a large - sized cell . in this case , optimal pilots are non - orthogonal with the same asymptotically optimal scheduling policy to that for regime iii ) , but with different optimal energy allocation is given as @xmath409 however , if @xmath410 is selected as in regime i ) , the equal - energy allocation becomes optimal . in case @xmath399 , in order to meet the latency requirement , the target throughput needs to be scaled as @xmath411 .",
    "it is worth noting that our analysis may be regarded as the results of the capacity - approaching receiver , even if we deal with simple linear receivers only because as @xmath412 , the lower - bound of the achievable rate of the zf or mrc receiver converges to the exact achievable rate , i.e. , @xmath413 and the achievable rate also converges to the capacity .",
    "the only required condition is @xmath414 , which is valid in regimes i ) and ii ) .",
    "however , this condition is not satisfied in regimes iii ) and iv ) , which implies that linear receivers become strictly sub - optimal if the network is operated in a limited energy regime .    from the above",
    ", it is shown that orthogonal pilots become optimal only in regime i ) , i.e. , only in a classical cellular system scenario , but non - orthogonal pilots become optimal in regimes ii)-iv ) , i.e. , in new scenarios for future cellular systems . to quantify the advantages of using non - orthogonal pilots , the asymptotically optimal network latency using orthogonal pilots only is given as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath415 but the network does not allow non - orthogonal pilots ( i.e. , @xmath416 ) . as @xmath378 and @xmath137 with @xmath390 , the asymptotically optimal network latency is given as @xmath417    since non - orthogonal pilots are not allowed , the asymptotically optimal network latency is obtained by using @xmath418 and @xmath419 .",
    "as the number of bs antennas increases , the gain obtained by allowing non - orthogonal pilots becomes quite dramatic in regimes ii)-iv ) . in regimes",
    "iii ) and iv ) , @xmath1 times lower network latency can be achieved . in regime",
    "ii ) , the use of non - orthogonal pilots makes the network latency decrease sub - linearly rather than logarithmically with @xmath1 .",
    "thus , an important design guideline can be derived : _ for a latency - sensitive application , it would be better to serve more users by employing non - orthogonal pilots , which is quite dramatic in the case of being operated in a high energy regime with a high target throughput , and is still quite meaningful even in the case of being operated in a low energy regime_.    in order to prevent the misunderstanding on the above results , we would like to emphasize that each of users is assumed to have an independent transmit energy source for transmission in this paper .",
    "so , as the number of scheduled users increases , more energy is consumed at a given sub - frame .",
    "thus , in a low energy regime , i.e. , regime iii ) or iv ) , the gain coming from scheduling more users is larger than the channel estimation quality degradation , which is clearly different compared to the case in @xcite , where the total energy dedicated for a transmission is fixed regardless of the number of scheduled users .",
    "in this paper , the latency - optimal static uplink scheduling policy is provided and its network latency is analyzed in an uplink training - based lsas employing simple zf or mrc receiver .",
    "the optimal uplink scheduling problem considered in this paper is to minimize the network latency when each user is constrained with a target throughput and energy limit and the corresponding optimal solution provides the optimal scheduling groups with their own scheduling portions , the optimal energy allocation between the training and data phases for each user , and the optimal frame configuration for the training based lsas .",
    "the optimal energy allocation is derived in a simple close - form for a given scheduling group and the optimal scheduling groups are found to be comprised of users with similar received signal quality .",
    "then , a low - complexity uplink scheduling algorithm providing the exact optimal solution is proposed with polynomial - time complexity of @xmath420 . via numerical examples",
    ", it is shown that the proposed uplink scheduling algorithm can provide an optimal policy which can provide several times lower network latency at given throughput and energy constraints over the conventional non - optimized scheduling algorithms in realistic environments , which shows that the proposed work can be a key enabler for the oncoming 5 g communication networks .",
    "in addition , the proposed uplink scheduling policy and the corresponding optimal network latency are analyzed asymptotically to provide better insights on the system behavior . as the number of users increases , it is shown that the network latency , normalized by the number of total users , converges to a deterministic quantity and asymptotically optimal frame configuration and scheduling policy can be obtained , which gives a way to construct much simpler asymptotically optimal uplink scheduling policy with complexity of @xmath328 .",
    "further , four operating regimes are classified according to the growth or decay rate of the average received signal quality and the number of bs antennas .",
    "it turns out that orthogonal pilot sequences , widely used in current systems , are optimal only when the average received signal quality is sufficiently good and the number of bs antennas is not - so - large , i.e. , only in a conventional scenario . in other regimes representing new service and system scenarios , it turns out that non - orthogonal pilot sequences become optimal . by using non - orthogonal pilots ,",
    "the network latency can be reduced by a factor of @xmath6 when the received signal quality is quite poor ( @xmath4 ) or by a factor of @xmath7 when the received signal quality is sufficiently good ( @xmath8 ) and the number of bs antennas is sufficiently large ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , this work proves that , in order to minimize the network latency , it is better to schedule users more than the amount of available training resource by employing non - orthogonal pilots for a training - based lsas , which would be a critical guideline for designing 5 g cellular communication systems supporting massive mtc ( or iot ) with low energy or latency - sensitive ultra - reliable tactile internet services .",
