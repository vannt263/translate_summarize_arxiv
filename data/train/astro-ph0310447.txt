    "internal velocity dispersions of the ucds and a comparison de , n ( fcc303 ) have been measured using the vlt and keck telescopes ( drinkwater et al.2003 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the ucds range from 24 to 37 km s@xmath0 , considerably higher than those of galactic gcs .",
    "the ucds lie well off the globular cluster l @xmath1 @xmath2@xmath3 relation in a previously unoccupied region .",
    "this supports the `` galaxy threshing '' model in which the ucds are the remnant nuclei of infalling de , ns which have been tidally disrupted by the cluster cd galaxy ( bekki et al .",

    "n galaxy reduces the total luminosity by about a factor of 100 but barely changes the central velocity dispersion .",
    "we obtained deep multicolour imaging ( u , g , r , i ) of the core of the fornax cluster taken with the ctio mosaic camera .",
    "the colours of the ucds were compared with a sample of ngc 1399 globulars ( mieske et al .",
