    "the key component of the unification model for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is a geometrically thick torus ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) where gas and dust obscure the primary optical - ultraviolet agn emission , depending on the line - of - sight viewing angle .",
    "the signature of such a torus is a pronounced infrared ( ir ) peak in the spectral energy distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) , which is interpreted as thermal emission from hot dust heated by the primary radiation ( @xcite ) . in this scenario",
    "the obscuring material surrounding the agn accretion disk has a hydrostatic toroidal geometry and is thought to begin at the dust sublimation radius and extend for tens , or possibly even hundreds , of parsecs @xcite .",
    "a smooth continuous distribution of the medium in the torus leads to stability problems .",
    "thus it has been suggested that the thick torus should either be clumpy @xcite , or be supported by an additional force combined with the thermal pressure .",
    "nuclear star formation ( sf ) can play an important role in sustaining its vertical extent , e.g. through stellar radiation pressure @xcite , supernovae explosions @xcite , or stellar winds @xcite .",
    "thus the connection between agn activity and nuclear sf is an important issue related to the torus structure .",
    "indeed nuclear sf happens in all types of agn @xcite , and there is evidence that enhanced sf ( reaching starburst intensities ) is related to the black hole accretion rate @xcite .",
    "thanks to the capabilities of the adaptive optics assisted integral field spectroscopy , it has recently become possible to study the inner 100  pc of galaxies with a spatial resolution of @xmath310  pc .",
    "@xcite used sinfoni to analyse the molecular gas and stars in ngc  3227 , finding the central gas distribution was geometrically and optically thick , analogous to the standard molecular torus .",
    "furthermore they found a recent , but no longer active , starburst within the tens of parsecs around the agn that occurred @xmath4  myr ago .",
    "a similar result is found in a larger sample of agn galaxies , where there appears to be a delay of 50100  myr between the onset of star formation and the onset of agn activity @xcite . on similar scales of tens of parsecs , (",
    "* hereafter h09 ) traced the distribution and kinematics of the warm molecular gas , which they associated with the largest scale structures of the torus .",
    "analysis of the h@xmath5  ( 1 - 0)s(1 ) emission in these agn showed that the gas has a huge velocity dispersion ( 50100 km / s ) , implying it has a geometrically thick structure with a height of the order of the disk radius ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "moreover , based on spatial distribution , column density and kinematics , h09 concluded that the molecular gas is spatially mixed with the nuclear stellar population .    in an attempt to further understand the circumnuclear structure around agn , we present here ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 1 - 0 ) distributions and kinematics in four nearby seyfert galaxies observed with the _ plateau de bure interferometer _",
    "( pdbi ) . with this array , it is possible to reach a spatial resolution of @xmath7 at 89  ghz .",
    "although this is still one order of magnitude larger than the resolution obtainable at near - ir wavelengths , the millimetre regime offers a number of clear advantages , most importantly the excellent spectral resolution and that the emission is free of extinction .",
    "our main purpose of this paper is to understand whether the high dispersion seen previously in the warm h@xmath5 is related to the tracer properties , or whether it is really representative of the bulk gas properties .",
    "this is an important distinction because the 2.12  @xmath8 m h@xmath5 line traces just the warm ( @xmath9  k ) component of the gas , which accounts only for a tiny fraction of the total gas mass ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "in contrast , the ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 1 - 0 ) transitions probe the cold ( @xmath11k ) and dense ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) molecular gas @xcite and are thus suitable for our purposes .",
    "this is the case mainly for two reasons : ( _ i _ )  and  lines trace @xmath14 times denser gas than corresponding ( rotational ) co transitions and ( _ ii _ )  ( and ) are relatively strong close to the agn , and weaker elsewhere .",
    "in fact the  ( and ) to co intensity ratio can be significantly higher in agn than in starburst or quiescent regions @xcite .",
    "we note that the x - ray irradiation of the gas by the agn may affect the nuclear chemistry ( i.e. molecular abundances ) .",
    "for example , models in @xcite and @xcite show that the equilibrium abundances depend on the ratio of the local gas density and the incident x - ray ionization rate .",
    "these effects are beyond the scope of this work , but are investigated with specific reference to ngc3227 by @xcite . despite this , a modified chemistry should have little impact on the molecular gas kinematics .",
    "the use of two tracers , when available , reduces the risk that the observed kinematics are skewed by chemistry affecting the inferred gas mass distribution . as such ,  and  lines",
    "can be used to reliably measure the characteristic kinematics of the dense gas in the central region .    in this paper",
    "we present ( 1 - 0 ) observations for ngc  2273 , ngc  3227 , ngc  4051 and ngc  6951 together with ( 1 - 0 ) data for ngc  2273 and ngc  4051 .",
    "obervations and data reduction are discussed in section  2 , and the general properties of the molecular gas are presented in section  3 . in section  4",
    "we analyse the dense gas kinematics , and section  5 is dedicated to the evolutionary interpretation .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  6 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a rotating gaseous disk becomes unstable once the local gravity overcomes both differential rotation and turbulent pressure , i.e. when the toomre q parameter @xcite is smaller than a critical value q@xmath15 :    @xmath16    in equation  [ q ] , g is the gravitational constant , @xmath17 the local velocity dispersion ; and @xmath18 is the epicyclic frequency , which is a function of the angular velocity @xmath19 . an isothermal thick disk has a critical q parameter @xmath20 @xcite . for a uniform disk",
    "the epicyclic frequency becomes : @xmath21 with @xmath22 the rotation velocity at radius @xmath23 .",
    "the surface density of the gaseous disk in eq .",
    "[ q ] is : @xmath24 where , in the right part , we replace the gas mass m@xmath25 with the derived dynamical mass m@xmath26 scaled by the gas fraction @xmath27 .",
    "because of significant random motions ( @xmath28 from table  [ tb : kin ] ) , we note that m@xmath26 , in turn , depends on both rotation velocity and dispersion : @xmath29 equation  [ md ] arises from combining the kinetic energy of the random motions , which we take to be @xmath30 ( assuming @xmath17 comes from macroscopic turbulence , and that we measure a one - dimensional component of an isotropic three - dimensional distribution ) , with a @xmath31 term for the rotation .",
    "finally , we use the relation between size scales and kinematics for a compact disk , which gives : @xmath32 by substituting equations  [ k ] , [ s ] , [ md ] , and [ th ] into the q parameter definition ( eq .  [ q ] ) we obtain a simple expression for q , that depends only on the geometric structure of the thick disk and the gas fraction : @xmath33 we note that eq .",
    "[ qdf ] is , for example , analogous to the expression derived in @xcite , but with an added term corresponding to the mass supported by random motions .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the dense gas fraction @xmath34 , once the molecular gas mass is estimated .",
    "the  luminosity ( l@xmath35 ) is related to @xmath36 through @xcite : @xmath37 the dynamical mass , as given in eq .",
    "[ md ] , is listed in table  [ tb : qpar ] together with the  luminosity , gas fraction and the toomre q parameter computed at the scale radius r taken from table  [ tb : kin ] .",
    "the estimate of the uncertainties given in the table is based only on the propagation of random errors , and does not include systematic uncertainties such as the coefficients used to estimate the dynamical mass or the uniqueness of the relation between hcn luminosity and gas mass . nevertheless , with a gas fraction of @xmath38 as derived above , there are indications that the q parameter is greater than the critical value , which would imply that the central 30 - 100  pc of our agn are stable against star formation .",
    "the high toomre q parameters derived for our sample ( table  [ tb : qpar ] ) , indicate that it should not be possible for the gas to rapidly form stars .",
    "we expect , therefore , that no significant star formation should be detected in the central @xmath2pc regions observed with the pdbi . to verify this conjecture , we look for ongoing sf by investigating mid - infrared spectra in the context of other observations .",
    "the @xmath39 m waveband is expected to show strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features if the molecules are excited by radiation from young massive stars @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir spectra obtained with _",
    "spitzer_/irs @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : spitzer ] .",
    "all the sources exhibit strong pah emissions , suggestive of significant star formation .",
    "but it is not clear where the sf is spatially located .",
    "indeed , due to the irs slit aperture of @xmath40 , the spectra are integrated over the central 450  pc , 305  pc , 180  pc and 370  pc respectively for ngc  2273 , ngc  3227 , ngc  4051 and ngc  6951 .",
    "data obtained at high angular resolution can help , but it can still sometimes be hard to reach a firm conclusion .",
    "as described in section  3.2 , in ngc  3227 the  nuclear emission is surrounded by an annular structure seen with co(2 - 1 ) line and h - band continuum observations ( fig .",
    "[ fg : maps ] , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this circumnuclear ring hosts the bulk of the current sf ; while at radii @xmath41  pc , sf has recently ceased .",
    "this has been shown by adaptive optics observations @xcite , which reveal that the br@xmath42 equivalent width is inconsistent with on - going sf .",
    "based on this and other diagnostics , these authors concluded that the inner tens of parsecs in ngc  3227 have experienced a short starburst event in the last 40  myr , which has now ceased .    for both this source and ngc  2273",
    ", b06 find a reduction in the stellar velocity dispersion across the ring , which they ascribe to recent sf in dynamically cool gas .",
    "the implication is that the higher dispersion in the nucleus indicates that sf is not active there . for ngc  2273",
    ", the circumnuclear ring is clearly visible also in hst / nicmos images @xcite . from their spectroscopic data ,",
    "@xcite relate h@xmath43 emission to hii regions in the ring , whereas they argue that the nuclear [ oiii]/h@xmath43 ratio is typical of agn .",
    "thus , although we can not firmly rule it out , these results from b06 and @xcite suggest that , as for ngc  3227 , there is no current sf in the nucleus .    in ngc  4051 stellar kinematic measurements",
    "have been prevented by the strong agn emission ( b06 ; @xcite , hereafter r08 ) , and the central physics are more puzzling .",
    "the br@xmath42 emission is very compact and it is hard to draw firm conclusion : r08 find no rotation and argue that most of the emitting gas is not confined to the plane of the galaxy ; in contrast , @xcite trace a br@xmath42 velocity field consistent with rotation , that is seen also in the h@xmath5 1 - 0s(1 ) and stellar kinematics ( h09 ) . from the h@xmath5 line ratios r08 argue that the gas is thermalised rather than fluorescently excited as one might expect from recent star formation .",
    "although this could instead be due to high densities , the h@xmath5  ( 1 - 0)s(1)/br@xmath42 ratio in the nucleus is about 1 , higher than expected if the heating process is due to uv radiation from young stars .",
    "moreover , r08 also detect [ oiii ] and [ caviii ] lines characterized by blue wings and argue that significant line emission originates from the agn narrow - line region .",
    "thus , a similar origin of the compact br@xmath42 emission is plausible . on the other hand ,",
    "if we do attribute the br@xmath42 emission to sf , we can estimate its equivalent width once the flux measured by @xcite is corrected for dilution ( see fig .  1 in r08 ) .",
    "this yields an equivalent width of about 7 , a low value for sf that , according to @xcite , implies ceased sf activity . finally , @xcite are able to give only an upper limit for the @xmath44 m pah feature using a @xmath45 slit .",
    "we can thus conclude that the sf is ngc  4051 is mainly located between @xmath45 and @xmath40 , and if a nuclear component within the central 40  pc is present , it is not significant .",
    "in addition to its agn , ngc  6951 also exhibits a pronounced starburst ring located at @xmath46 ( 480  pc ) from the nucleus . plausibly , most of the pah emission may originate from this ring , which has been observed in several wavebands : near - ir @xcite , optical ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , and radio @xcite .",
    "high resolution observations detect strong co and  emission both in the ring and the central agn ( k07 ; @xcite , @xcite ) . while the /co ratio in the ring is typical of a starburst , the  is significantly enhanced in the nucleus",
    ". the higher nuclear ratio could be due either to denser and/or hotter gas than in the starburst ring , or because the gas chemistry in the nucleus of ngc 6951 is dominated by x - ray radiation from the agn , skewing relative abundances ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , again , significant sf close around the agn can not easily be excluded .",
    "the radio observations can help to address this issue .",
    "the supernova rate , estimated from the nuclear radio flux density , is @xmath47  yr@xmath48 @xcite , much smaller than would be expected for strong ongoing sf , and rather less than in ngc  3227 where the sf has ceased @xcite .",
    "indeed , if the sf is continuous , we can estimate an associated sf rate ( sfr ) from equation  20 in @xcite , obtaining sfr(m@xmath49m@xmath50)@xmath51  m@xmath50yr@xmath48 ( including stars below 5  m@xmath50 , thus a factor of 2 higher as for the original @xcite relation ) .",
    "this is comparable to the time - averaged sfr for the nuclear regions of other agn @xcite , and provides an upper limit to the actual on - going sfr .",
    "we have analysed 3  mm interferometric data obtained with the pdbi tracing the ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 1 - 0 ) molecular lines in four local agn . our main conclusion , that these lines typically trace a thick disk with suppressed star formation , is based on the following :    \\1 .",
    "the line emission is marginally resolved in all four seyfert galaxies .",
    "when data for both  and  are available , their spatial extents are in good agreement within the errors .    \\2 .",
    "the global kinematics are consistent with rotation .",
    "we create dynamical models that match the observations , using four constraints , namely the integrated linewidth , the diameters of the major and minor axes , and the separation of the red and blue channel map centroids .",
    "the resulting structure is a geometrically thick disk .",
    "the most remarkable feature is a high velocity dispersion that , once corrected for beam smearing using the dynamical models above , lies in the range 20 - 40  km / s .",
    "this is about a factor 2 lower than the stellar and/or h@xmath5 1 - 0s(1 ) dispersion , but is still remarkably high considering that we are tracing dense molecular gas .",
    "it implies a vertical height h@xmath52 of the scale radius r.    \\4 .",
    "finally , we estimate the gas fraction within r ( @xmath53 ) and the toomre q parameter , finding that the central @xmath2  pc should be stable against star formation .",
    "this result appears to be observationally confirmed by the lack of ongoing nuclear sf in the nucleus ( although there is plentiful evidence for on - going star formation in circumnuclear rings ) .",
    "ngc  4051 remains the most puzzling source , with the lowest velocity dispersion and unclear evidence for or against nuclear star formation .",
