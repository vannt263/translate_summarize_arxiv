    "the properties of electron transport in nanoscopic semiconductor devices are an important diagnostic tool in the basic study of charge and spin degrees of freedom of functional and reliable nanoelectronic devices  @xcite . in quantum dots defined electrostatically in a two dimensional electron gas",
    "@xcite , both the electron number and the tunnel coupling to the leads are tunable .",
    "when high potential barriers separate the quantum dot from the source and drain reservoirs , tunneling to and from the dot is weak and the number of electrons @xmath0 on the dot is a well - defined integer . in the coulomb blockade ( cb ) regime  @xcite , transport proceeds primarily by sequential resonant tunneling events and @xmath0 fluctuates by one . in the non - equilibrium regime , where more than one transport channel lies within the bias window , a classical transport treatment  @xcite is no longer appropriate , and a nonequilibrium quantum approach is imperative  @xcite . in this paper , we microscopically derive analytic expressions for the current in the sequential regime through the formalism of the reduced density matrix and generalized master equations for the evolution of the occupation probabilities  @xcite .",
    "one of the main motivations is the recent observation of negative differential conductance in theory and experiment  @xcite in several specific systems .",
    "our goal in the present work is to derive rather general but well - defined conditions for the suppression or even the quenching of current whenever a second channel enters the bias window .",
    "we define our model as a two - dimensional lateral quantum dot  @xcite weakly coupled to source and drain reservoirs , where the total hamiltonian is given by    @xmath1    the source and drain hamiltonians , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , are taken to be noninteracting fermion systems shifted by the bias : @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 a creation and an anihilation operator , respectively , for particles in the source ( drain ) reservoir .    the quantum dot hamiltonian in eq .",
    "is given by , @xmath7 where the single - particle energies @xmath8 are shifted by the applied gate voltage @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the interaction among the confined particles , which we leave general in the present work .",

    "we assume operators in each subsystem are independent of each other , and that the eigenstates of the system are known . for @xmath17 in ( [ eq : qdothamil ] ) ,",
    "these states are , in general , correlated states  coherent superpositions of slater determinants .",
    "we derive master equations for a non - equilibrium system ( @xmath18 ) by means of the reduced density matrix , @xmath19 of the system  @xcite . in the born - redfield theory",

    "the first term in the integrand of  ( [ eq : wmn ] ) describes the dot interaction with the source reservoir .",
    "this portion of @xmath21 may be written as @xmath31 respectively denoting the addition and removal of an electron to or from the dot , corresponding to the two terms of  ( [ eq : spectralall ] ) .",
    "the second term in  ( [ eq : wmn ] ) , describes analogous interactions with the drain reservoir , allowing us to symbolically decompose  ( [ eq : wmn ] ) into four terms , @xmath32 denoting the addition and removal of particles from the source and drain reservoirs .",
    "it is useful to define a generalized chemical potential @xmath33 , as the energy required to add a particle to the @xmath0-particle ground state , yielding an @xmath34-particle system in the @xmath35 excited state ( @xmath36 is therefore the usual chemical potential ) .",

    "the system is in the @xmath0-particle ground state when the chemical potential @xmath40 lies below the fermi energy of the reservoirs , and @xmath41 lies above the fermi energy .",
    "if we denote by @xmath0 the number of confined particles at equilibrium , and by @xmath42 the number of particles in the state @xmath16 , then by an analysis of eqns .",
    "( [ eq : spectralall ] ) , ( [ eq : spectralreduced ] ) and  ( [ eq : spectralreservoir ] ) , one can deduce that @xmath21 is non - zero only when one or more of the following four sets of conditions are satisfied :    [ eq : wcond ] @xmath43    here , @xmath44 denotes the difference in chemical potentials between @xmath45 particles and @xmath0 particles in the dot .",

    "we consider the current through a quantum dot such that electrons tunnel into the dot from the source reservoir , and out of the dot to the drain .",

    "the current is proportional to the difference between these two quantities : @xmath59 , where , for example , @xmath60 .    using  ( [ gme_sd ] ) we obtain ,    [ eq : current ] @xmath61    and @xmath62 in the steady - state regime .",

    "we define three many - body states : @xmath63 is the @xmath0-particle ground state , @xmath64 is the @xmath0-particle first excited state .",
    "the transitions between these states are governed in part by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wcond ] ) .    there will be precisely one channel in the transport window , fig .",

    "coupled set and inserting into  ( [ eq : current ] ) , the steady state currents are found to be @xmath69 which is the standard expression  @xcite for a two - level steady state dc current .",
    "the two - channel regime , fig .  [ energ1]c , is entered upon relaxing condition  ( [ eq : onechannel2 ] ) .",
    "if we again assume unit occupation of the @xmath0-particle ground state as our initial condition , the set  ( [ gme ] ) now reduces to three equations :    @xmath70    transport now involves the ground states of the @xmath0 and @xmath71-particle ground states ",

    "negative differential conductance will be observed whenever @xmath78 .",
    "that is , an increase in the bias reduces the current .",
    "general conditions under which such phenomena occur are explored in the subsequent sections .",
    "to explore the relative magnitudes of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we define two anisotropies .",
    "the first is an extrinsic anisotropy characterizing the barrier widths . if we assume tunneling to and from the source is proportional to tunneling to and from the drain , we can write @xmath79 for all many - body states @xmath22 and @xmath23 . through eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmn ] ) , these can be related directly to the tunneling coefficients @xmath80 , @xmath81 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tunnelhamil ] ) .",

    "the second anisotropy is intrinsic to the dot and denotes the relative ease with which particles can tunnel to different orbitals .",
    "core orbitals tightly bound to the center of the dot , for example , have weaker coupling to the leads than do orbitals localized around the edge of the dot . for the particular case of the many - body states @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 defined above , we write @xmath86 where @xmath72 and @xmath74 are @xmath0-body states , and @xmath73 is an @xmath71-body state .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath87 will be determined by the spatial extent of the single - particle orbitals involved in the respective transitions .",
    "starting from the @xmath71-particle state @xmath73 , @xmath88 describes an electron tunneling out of the dot , leaving the system in the @xmath0-particle state @xmath72 , whereas @xmath89 describes a similar process , with the system ending up in state @xmath74 .",
    "the ration @xmath87 depends on the particular orbitals involved .    in the example we give below ,",

    "( [ currents_c ] ) , and @xmath76 , eq .",
    "( [ currents_b ] ) , in terms of the anisotropy parameters @xmath91 and @xmath87 , we find @xmath92 for @xmath93 , current is suppressed and , in the extreme case of @xmath94 ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) , the presence of the second channel in the transport window completely quenches the current , @xmath96 . a detail of the coulomb diamond for which this analysis applies is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : coulomddiamond ] .    as an illustrative example",
    ", we consider a two - dimensional parabolic quantum dot , confining two electrons , with sequential resonant tunneling proceeding by the addition and removal of a third electron .",
    "the three states corresponding to fig .",
    "[ energ1]c are the ground - state singlet , @xmath72 , the lowest - energy triplet , @xmath74 , and the three - particle ground state , @xmath73 .",
    "these respective configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2econfig ] .",
    "the orbitals can be labeled by two harmonic oscillator indices plus spin , @xmath97 , where the shell number is given by @xmath98 , and the angular momentum @xmath99 . with regard to fig .",
    "[ fig:2econfig ] , we have @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . the orbital @xmath102 penetrates the barrier  @xcite to a greater degree than the @xmath103 orbital , and so the tunneling amplitude @xmath104 has smaller magnitude than @xmath105 ; depending on the geometry and the magnetic field , this difference can be severe .",
    "in general , we expect @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intrinsicanis ] ) .    in the two - channel regime ,",
    "we look first at the symmetric barrier case , @xmath107 . here , suppression of current , @xmath93 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : currentratio ] ) , occurs whenever @xmath108 , that is , whenever tunneling into the edge is more than two times as likely as tunneling into the core . in this case",
    ", current is never completely quenched ; the limiting case ( @xmath109 ) has @xmath110 .",
    "complete quenching does occur , however , if we additionally have a barrier asymmetry . specifically ,",
    "if the source barrier is sufficiently opaque such that tunneling into the core from the source reservoir is suppressed ( @xmath95 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2econfig ] ) , but tunneling from the core to the drain is not ( @xmath111 ) , then @xmath94 and @xmath96 even though @xmath112 ; the addition of the second transport channel in the bias window suppresses the current completely .",
    "once state @xmath74 becomes occupied , the system is blocked and no other transitions can occur .",
    "this quenching of current is a _ dynamical blockade _ : it requires an interplay between both ground and excited states .",
    "this is in contrast to effects such as a ) spin blockade , where a transition changing the number of electrons by one is accompanied by a change of spin greater than 1/2  @xcite , or b ) blockade due to spin polarized injection and extraction of charge carriers  @xcite , where the current is quenched due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the quenching of current will be destroyed whenever the spin - flip plus orbital decay rate is large compared to the dwell time of the tunneling electron . in this case ,",
    "a direct transition from @xmath74 to @xmath72 may occur by emission of a phonon and simultaneous absorption of spin through nuclear baths , spin - orbit coupling , or other spin - symmetry - breaking process .",
    "likewise , strong coulomb correlations will generally open up additional tunneling pathways , likely involving edge orbitals , and this too will destroy the quenching of current .",
    "in conclusion , we have derived a set of general yet well - defined conditions for quenching of transport through a multichannel quantum dot . we find that under certain tunneling anisotropies the presence of a second transport channel may decrease the current through the dot .",
    "specifically , if the tunneling rates to or from core states are less than half than the rates to or from edge states , the current may be suppressed .",
    "complete quenching of the current may occur if , in addition to the edge / core anisotropy , an anisotropy between source and drain barriers is also present .",
    "the presence of these dark channels is a measure of the lifetime of excited states .",
    "finally , although the present work focused on the two - electron case , the general phenomena should appear in numerous locations throughout the coulomb diamonds ; it can generally appear whenever ground - state tunneling transitions involve edge orbitals , and excited - states tunneling involves core orbitals , and asymmetric source and drain barriers are present ."
