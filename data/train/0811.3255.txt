    "sulentic et al . (",
    "2000b ) developed a semi - analysis model in which the rfe depends on @xmath10 as @xmath68 .",
    "although the rfe is found to generally increase with @xmath10 in optical bright quasars , netzer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that a number of high - z quasars deviate the trend , i.e. , with very small rfe but large @xmath10 ( see also in netzer & trakhtenbrot 2007 )",
    ". using the large database provided by the sloan digital sky survey , netzer & trakhtenbrot ( 2007 ) recently suggested that the enhanced rfe is mainly caused by increased metal abundance .    in the current sample ,",
    "the distribution of rfe is shown in the right panel of figure 5 .",
    "rfe uniformly ranges from @xmath69 to 1 .",
    "on the contrary , @xmath10 distributes in a quite narrow range as describe above .",
    "in fact , no correlation between rfe and @xmath10 is found in our sample ( see the upper panel in figure 6 ) , which motivates us to suspect that rfe does not depend on @xmath10 only .",
    "rfe is plotted against the characteristic disk temperature @xmath70 in the bottom panel in figure 6 .",
    "the temperature scales with @xmath10 and @xmath9 as predicted by the standard geometric thin disk model ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "the exact formula of disk temperature depends on various accretion disk models . for a rapidly rotating kerr hole , with a spin parameter @xmath71 and efficiency of 0.31",
    ", we have @xmath72 .",
    "the diagram indicates an obvious correlation between the two parameters .",
    "a spearman rank - order test calculated by survival analysis yields a formal correlation coefficient @xmath73 ( @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the probability of null correlation ) . the correlation is not highly significant probably because of the small sample size .",
    "the estimated temperature spans about one order of magnitude ( @xmath76 ) , corresponding to a factor of @xmath77 .",
    "the correlation then suggests a trend of more intensive emission for higher disk temperature .",
    "a marginal dependence of the continuum shape of qsos on @xmath70 was recently identified by bonning et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who compared the observations of sdss with the nlte models of accretion disk .",
    "the current result means that the strength of the emission is likely controlled by the spectral shape of the ionizing continuum .",
    "the physical reason of the absence of the baldwin relationship ( baldwin 1977 ) for low ionization emission lines is still an open question .",
    "in fact , a weak inverse baldwin relationship for h@xmath0 has been demonstrated by recent studies basing upon large agn samples ( e.g. , croom et al .",
    "2002 ; greene & ho 2005 ) .",
    "we identify a tight , positive correlation between @xmath63 and ew(h@xmath41 ) in our hard x - ray selected agns ( i.e. , an inverse baldwin relationship ) .",
    "figure 7 presents the correlation with correlation coefficient @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) estimated by the spearman rank - order analysis .",
    "ew(h@xmath41 ) roughly scales with hard x - ray luminosity as @xmath80 .",
    "wilkes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) identified a marginal baldwin effect in h@xmath0 line . noted that they examined only the luminous local quasars with @xmath81",
    "although many models are developed to explain the baldwin effect for high ionization emission lines ( e.g. , , wandel 1999 ; korista et al .",
    "1998 ; shields et al . 1995 ; wills et al .",
    "1999 ; baskin & loar 2004 ; bachev et al .",
    "2004 ) , these models can not explain the difference between and h@xmath0 .",
    "croom et al . ( 2002 ) suggested that the inverse baldwin relationship could be explained if the longer wavelength continuum contains emission from other components ( e.g. , thermal dust emission , non - thermal radio emission , starlight ) .",
    "we estimate the possible contribution of the unknown sources as follows .",
    "we start from the relationship @xmath82 , and re - write @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the agn luminosity and luminosity of other unknown sources at the h@xmath0 wavelength , respectively .",
    "the x - ray luminosity could be replaced by @xmath84 given eq .",
    "( 2 ) and the bolometric correction factor of 9 . replacing @xmath86 as @xmath84 given eq.(1 ) finally yields a relationship @xmath87 . considering the typical case with @xmath88 ,",
    "about 40% of the observed continuum at h@xmath0 wavelength is estimated to be contributed by the unknown sources .",
    "the properties ( @xmath10 and @xmath9 ) of accretion onto smbh are examined in a sample of 42 hard x - ray selected ( 3 - 60kev ) broad - line agns in terms of their optical spectra taken by us .",
    "the energy range is harder than that usually used in the similar previous studies .",
    "these agns are mainly compiled from the rxte all sky survey ( sazonov & revnivtsev 2004 ) , and are complemented by the released _ integral agn sample ( bassani et al .",
    "the statistical analysis allows us to draw the following conclusions : _    1 .",
    "we confirm the tight correlation between the hard x - ray and optical emission line luminosities ( and bolometric luminosity ) in our sample , which suggests a close link between the hard x - ray emission reflected by the ionized surface of the accretion disk and uv / optical radiation .",
    "using the hard x - ray luminosity , a strong inverse baldwin relationship of the h@xmath0 emission line is identified in the sample .",
    "2 .   the hard x - ray selected broad - line agns listed in the sample are found to be strongly biased toward luminous agns with high @xmath10 and low column density . since @xmath10 is constant ( mostly between 0.01 and 0.1 ) in a first order approximation , the hard x - ray luminosity",
    "is strongly correlated with the black hole mass in our sample , which is most likely due to the selection effect of the surveys .",
    "although the rfe parameter is independent on @xmath10 in our sample , it is found to be correlated with the accretion disk temperature as assessed by @xmath89 .",
    "this result implies that the strength of the emission is determined by the shape of the ionizing spectrum .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that a new era in agn hard x - ray study will be opened in next a few years due to the launch of new missions with enhanced hard x - ray detection capability in not only sensitivity , but also imaging , such as simbol - x , next and nustar .",
    "these missions will provide larger , and more complete samples to study the present open issues .",

    "<S> the energy range in the sample is harder than that usually used in the similar previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> these agns are mainly complied from the rxte all sky survey ( xss ) , and complemented by the released _ integral agn catalog . the black hole masses , </S>",
    "<S> bolometric luminosities of agn , and eddington ratios are derived from their optical spectra in terms of the broad h@xmath0 emission line . </S>",
    "<S> the tight correlation between the hard x - ray ( 3 - 20kev ) and bolometric / line luminosity is well identified in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> also identified is a strong inverse baldwin relationship of the h@xmath0 emission line . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , all these hard x - ray agns are biased toward luminous objects with high eddington ratio ( mostly between 0.01 to 0.1 ) and low column density ( @xmath1 ) , which is most likely due to the selection effect of the surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the hard x - ray luminosity is consequently found to be strongly correlated with the black hole mass . </S>",
    "<S> we believe the sample completeness will be improved in the next few years by the ongoing _ swift and _ integral missions , and by the next advanced missions , such as nustar , simbol - x , and next . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the correlation between rfe ( = optical /h@xmath0 ) and disk temperature as assessed by @xmath2 leads us to suggest that the strength of the emission is mainly determined by the shape of the ionizing spectrum . _ _ _ </S>"
