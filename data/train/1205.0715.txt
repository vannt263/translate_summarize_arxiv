    "the detection of baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) in the large - scale distribution of galaxies in both the sdss @xcite and 2dfgrs @xcite redshift surveys was a triumph for the standard cosmological model ; the bao feature @xcite is essentially created by closely related physics to the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature power spectrum .",
    "therefore , the observed bao feature supports the standard cosmology in several independent ways : the existence of the feature supports the basic gravitational instability paradigm for structure formation ; the relative weakness of the bao feature supports the @xmath14 ratio of baryons to dark matter , since a baryon - dominated universe would have a bao feature much stronger than observed ; and the observed length - scale of the feature in redshift space is consistent with the concordance @xmath15cdm model derived from the cmb and other observations , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been several new independent measurements of the bao feature in galaxy redshift surveys , e.g. from sdss - dr8 @xcite , wigglez @xcite , 6dfgrs @xcite , and an angular measurement from sdss - dr9 @xcite , which are all consistent with the concordance @xmath15cdm model at the few - percent level .",
    "the bao feature is probably the best - understood standard ruler in the moderate - redshift universe , and therefore in conjunction with cmb observations it offers great power for constraining cosmological parameters including dark energy @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical and numerical studies @xcite have concluded that the comoving length - scale of the bao feature evolves by @xmath18 percent between the cmb era and @xmath19 due to non - linear growth of structure , but this shift can be corrected to the @xmath20 percent level using reconstruction methods @xcite .",
    "therefore , there are several very ambitious redshift surveys including the ongoing wigglez @xcite , boss @xcite and hetdex , the recently approved esa euclid space mission @xcite , and the proposed bigboss and wfirst , which plan to survey @xmath21 million galaxy redshifts over huge volumes , to give sub - percent measurements of the bao feature at various redshifts @xmath22 .",
    "however , one drawback of the bao feature is that the comoving length @xmath23 is calibrated at @xmath24 using a combination of cmb observations and theory ; this leaves us vulnerable to systematic errors from possible unknown new physics at early times ( see  [ sec : bao ] for discussion ) .",
    "low - redshift measurements of the bao scale essentially measure a ratio of @xmath25 relative to some distance which is itself dependent on cosmological parameters @xmath26 etc .",
    "therefore , in a joint fit to cmb+bao data , a wrong assumption in the cmb measurement of @xmath25 may be masked by biased values of cosmological parameters , i.e. a `` precisely wrong '' outcome ( see  [ sec : neff ] for an example ) .    in this letter",
    "we present a new and useful approximation which can accurately anchor the absolute bao lengthscale using only low redshift measurements at @xmath11 , therefore providing a clean zero - parameter test of the standard early - universe cosmology , in particular the density of relativistic particles .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in   [ sec : bao ] we briefly review the main features of bao observations , then in   [ sec : dvdl ] we present the new approximation for the dilation scale @xmath27 . in ",
    "[ sec : neff ] we review the effects of non - standard radiation density , and in   [ sec : dist ] we discuss potential observational issues for measuring the absolute bao length .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in   [",
    "sec : conc ] .    throughout the paper we use the standard notation that @xmath28 is the present - day density of species @xmath29 relative to the critical density ; and the physical density @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "our default model is flat @xmath15cdm with @xmath32 ; in other cases , @xmath2 is the dark energy equation of state , @xmath33 is the total density parameter , and @xmath34 .",
    "the bao feature appears as a single hump in the galaxy correlation function @xmath35 , or equivalently a series of decaying wiggles in the power spectrum ( see @xcite for a clear exposition , and @xcite for a recent review ) . in the following , we denote @xmath25 to be the comoving length scale of the bao feature in a galaxy redshift survey , while @xmath23 is the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch @xmath36 , which is conventionally defined as the fitting formula eq .  4 of @xcite .",
    "these lengths are not quite identical due to evolution of perturbations after the drag epoch and non - linear growth of structure , but the shifts are predicted to be below the 0.6 percent level and well correctable from theory @xcite ; therefore , measuring the bao feature at low redshift provides a very robust link to the sound horizon in the cmb era .    in the small angle approximation and assuming we observe a redshift shell which is thin compared with its mean redshift , the angular size of the bao feature is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the usual proper angular - diameter distance to redshift @xmath3 ; and the difference in redshift along one bao length in the line - of - sight direction is @xmath39",
    "@xcite    in practice , current galaxy redshift surveys are not quite large enough to distinguish the bao feature separately in angular and radial directions , so the current measurements constrain a spherically - averaged length scale ; the most model - independent quantity derived from these observations is @xmath40 , where @xmath5 is called the dilation scale and is defined by @xcite as @xmath41^{1/3}\\ ] ] this is essentially a geometric mean of two transverse and one radial directions .",
    "measuring the bao feature from a galaxy redshift survey requires a mapping from observed galaxy positions and redshifts to galaxy pair separations in comoving coordinates , which is itself dependent on cosmological parameters including @xmath42 etc .",
    "therefore , extracting the value of @xmath25 from a galaxy redshift survey is slightly theory - dependent ; but the above dimensionless ratios @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath40 are essentially theory - independent , since to first order any change in the reference cosmology produces an equal shift in the fitted length @xmath25 .    as above , the comoving length @xmath23 is defined as the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch @xmath36 @xcite . adopting standard early - universe assumptions , @xmath23 depends only on the densities of matter , baryons and radiation ; the latter is very well constrained by the cmb temperature ( assuming standard neutrino content ) , hence @xmath25 depends only on @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which in turn are well constrained by the heights and morphology of the first three cmb peaks .",
    "fits from the wmap7 data alone @xcite give @xmath47 with approximately 1.3  percent precision , and forthcoming data from the planck mission @xcite is expected to improve this prediction of @xmath25 to @xmath48 percent precision .",
    "we note that the cmb derivation of @xmath23 does not rely on assuming a flat universe or details of dark energy , since the observed cmb peak heights constrain @xmath45 and @xmath46 well without assuming flatness .",
    "however , the inference of @xmath23 does rely on many simple but weakly tested assumptions about the @xmath24 universe , including    1 .",
    "standard gr , 2 .",
    "standard radiation content ( photons plus an effective number @xmath49 light neutrinos ) , 3 .",
    "standard recombination history , including negligible variation in fundamental constants . 4 .",
    "negligible early dark energy , 5 .",
    "negligible contribution of isocurvature fluctuations , 6 .",
    "the primordial power spectrum is smooth and almost a power - law .",
    "densities of matter and radiation scale as the standard powers of scale factor ; e.g. negligible late - decaying particles at @xmath50 etc .",
    "if one or more of the above assumptions are wrong , this can bias the value of @xmath25 deduced from the cmb fits , and in turn this will generally result in biased inferences about other cosmological parameters ( especially @xmath0 ) when doing joint fits to cmb and bao data .",
    "possible violation of ( ii ) above was analysed by @xcite , and is discussed later in ",
    "[ sec : neff ] ; for some other non - standard cases , see for example @xcite for early dark energy , @xcite for varying @xmath51 , and @xcite for the effect of isocurvature fluctuations .    for the above reasons , measuring the _ absolute _ bao length scale at low redshift forms a powerful consistency test of the assumptions underlying standard cosmology at @xmath24 .",
    "the well - known route to this is to measure the transverse bao scale at some effective redshift which gives @xmath52 , and also use a combination of standard candles ( e.g. sne ia ) and the local hubble constant @xmath0 to measure the usual luminosity distance , @xmath53 , to the same redshift .",
    "combined with the standard distance - duality relation @xmath54 , this can give a theory - independent absolute measurement of the bao length .",
    "however , one disadvantage of the above is that it requires a bao survey of sufficiently large volume to separate the transverse and radial bao scales , and reaching sufficient cosmic volume requires a survey at significant redshift @xmath55 ; in turn , this means that type - ia sne are likely the only distance indicators bright enough to be useful for measuring @xmath53 , and there is a non - negligible time baseline over which supernova evolution may bias the measurements of @xmath53 .    as a complement to the above",
    ", it would be valuable to calibrate @xmath25 using bao measurements of @xmath56 at lower redshifts @xmath57 , combined with an accurate calibration of @xmath27 from distance indicators .",
    "although bao surveys at lower redshift suffer from increased cosmic variance due to the limited available volume , there are several compensating benefits : there is a shorter time baseline for possible evolution of sne properties ; the sne are brighter and more readily observable in the rest - frame near - ir ; and low redshift offers better prospects for using alternative distance indicators such as gravitational lens time - delays , and potentially gravitational - wave standard sirens @xcite ; and finally we avoid the complication of separating the radial and angular bao scales in the analysis .",
    "however , this low-@xmath3 route requires an absolute measurement of @xmath27 rather than @xmath38 , which is slightly more challenging ; from eq .",
    "[ eq : dv ] , a measurement of @xmath53 tells us @xmath27 apart from an unknown factor of @xmath58 ; this is helpful due to the 1/3 power of @xmath59 , but is not good enough for percent - level precision . at @xmath60 , @xmath61 as with all cosmological distances ; however , there is insufficient volume to measure the bao feature at @xmath62 , while beyond this cosmological distance effects can not be ignored . for a concordance @xmath15cdm model at an example @xmath63 , the crude approximation @xmath64 is 6  percent too large , while the approximation @xmath65 is too large by 1.6  percent ; these approximations are clearly not good enough for precision cosmology .",
    "since @xmath27 is directly related to the comoving volume element per unit redshift , via @xmath66 where @xmath67 is comoving volume and @xmath68 is solid angle , we could measure @xmath5 directly if we could observe a population of `` standard counters '' of known comoving number density .",
    "unfortunately , our limited understanding of galaxy evolution implies that there is little hope of finding standard counters good enough for a percent - level measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "alternatively , a direct measurement of @xmath69 is possible using differential ages of red galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , but again it may be very challenging to reach few - percent absolute accuracy with this method .    in the next section , we show a new alternative route for obtaining accurate calibration of @xmath5 : we find a much better approximation for @xmath5 , which relates @xmath27 to the observable @xmath7 at a slightly higher redshift , specifically @xmath70 .",
    "here we find an an accurate approximation relating the dilation length @xmath27 to the observable luminosity distance @xmath7 at a slightly higher redshift .",
    "we first define as usual the scale factor @xmath71 with @xmath72 , and the time - dependent hubble parameter @xmath73 where dot denotes time derivative .",
    "we also have the usual expression for comoving radial distance , @xmath74 in the appendix of @xcite , we found a good approximation at moderate redshift @xmath75 this approximation was derived using a taylor - series expansion of @xmath76 around redshift @xmath77 ; this results in the first derivative @xmath78 cancelling so there is no error of order @xmath79 , and uses the convenient fact that the second derivative @xmath80 has a zero - crossing at @xmath19 in a concordance @xmath15cdm model , so the error of order @xmath81 is small at moderate redshift . in a flat universe",
    "this leads to @xmath82 this is still fairly accurate even for weakly - curved models , since the multiplicative change in @xmath7 for a non - flat model is of order @xmath83 for fixed expansion history ; for plausible values of @xmath84 , this is a very small effect at @xmath11 .    in @xcite we also found a good approximation for @xmath27 at moderate redshift , which is @xmath85 both approximations ( [ eq : dlapp ] ) and ( [ eq : dvh ] ) are accurate to @xmath86 percent for @xmath87 for models reasonably close to standard @xmath15cdm ; the error in approximation ( [ eq : dvh ] ) is shown in figure  [ fig : dvh ] for some example models .",
    "( this will be useful below in   [ sec : omm ] ) .    both eqs .",
    "[ eq : dlapp ] and [ eq : dvh ] involve @xmath69 at slightly different redshifts ; however , it is clear from the above that if we consider a bao measurement at effective redshift @xmath88 , then @xmath89 is closely related to @xmath90 , while if we consider @xmath91 this is also related to @xmath92 ; we can therefore combine approximations [ eq : dlapp ] and [ eq : dvh ] to cancel the unknown @xmath93 , which gives the approximation @xmath94    we now explore the error in approximation [ eq : dvapp1 ] : figure  [ fig : dvapp1 ] shows the ratio of the rhs of eq .  [",
    "eq : dvapp1 ] to the exact @xmath27 for various example cosmological models .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we take @xmath32 for each model .",
    "specifically , figure  [ fig : dvapp1 ] shows three flat @xmath15cdm models with @xmath95 ; one flat @xmath2cdm model with @xmath96 ; and two non - flat @xmath15cdm models with @xmath97 = 0.9 and 1.1 respectively ; finally , an einstein - de sitter @xmath98 model , and a zero dark energy model with @xmath99 .",
    "( these latter two models are well known to be grossly inconsistent with cmb and other measurements , but are included for comparison purposes ) .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : dvapp1 ] that approximation  [ eq : dvapp1 ] is surprisingly accurate : for the three @xmath15cdm models the error is less than 0.2 percent at @xmath9 , and the @xmath2cdm model is only slightly worse .",
    "the two ocdm models are still quite good , with error @xmath100  percent at @xmath9 ; this is considerably better than the medium - term expected errors @xmath101 percent on the bao ratio , and also current upper limits on @xmath102 are significantly tighter than 0.1 ; more realistic values @xmath103 give rise to minimal error in ( [ eq : dvapp1 ] ) .",
    "therefore for any wmap - allowed model , the error in approximation ( [ eq : dvapp1 ] ) is several times smaller than the medium - term precision on bao observables .",
    "the approximation [ eq : dvapp1 ] becomes significantly worse for the einstein - de sitter and open zero-@xmath15 models , with errors respectively + 1.25  percent and + 2.0  percent at @xmath104 ; however , even these give sub - percent error at @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( [ eq : dvapp1 ] ) is exact at all @xmath3 for a de sitter model with @xmath106 , while its accuracy degrades rather slowly with increasing @xmath1 and/or curvature ; thus , for near - flat and accelerating models favoured by current data , it is remarkably accurate .",
    "an explanation of this property in terms of taylor series is given in appendix a : this shows that ( [ eq : dvapp1 ] ) is exact to second order in @xmath3 independent of all cosmological parameters ; while at third order , there is a fortunate coincidence that for deceleration parameter @xmath107 and small curvature , the difference in the @xmath81 coefficients is also small .",
    "this makes eq .",
    "[ eq : dvapp1 ] accurate at @xmath108 for all near - flat accelerating models , with little dependence on precise values of @xmath1 , @xmath10 , @xmath2 etc .",
    "( note that all results in the main body of the paper use the numerical integrals for @xmath5 and @xmath7 ; the taylor series in appendix a are only provided as an aid to intuition ) .",
    "we also see from figure  [ fig : dvapp1 ] that approximation  ( [ eq : dvapp1 ] ) is a slight overestimate of the exact @xmath27 for all the flat and open models shown ; only the closed model ( @xmath109 ) gives an underestimate .",
    "since ( [ eq : dvapp1 ] ) gives a slight overestimate of the exact @xmath5 for all the plausible models fairly close to @xmath15cdm , we can get a modest but useful improvement by removing this bias , by multiplying by a polynomial in @xmath3 chosen to give a good fit for concordance @xmath15cdm ; we find an excellent fit with small terms in @xmath81 and @xmath110 , specifically @xmath111    by construction , this approximation is excellent for the concordance model , with relative error @xmath112 percent at @xmath113 . for other plausible models ,",
    "the resulting ratio ( rhs of [ eq : dvapp2 ] ) / ( exact @xmath27 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : dvapp2 ] ; in this figure we have used a smaller range of @xmath10 for the non - flat models , and added two models with time - varying @xmath2 with the common parametrisation @xmath114 , to give a set of models roughly spanning the @xmath115 allowed range from current data .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : dvapp2 ] that approximation [ eq : dvapp2 ] is very accurate in the wmap - allowed neighbourhood of @xmath15cdm , including generous variations of @xmath1 , modest curvature and @xmath116 .",
    "for all the models shown the relative error is smaller than @xmath117 at @xmath118 , thus 0.2 percent error at @xmath119 .",
    "this error is substantially smaller than the cosmic variance in bao measurements , and the expected accuracy in next - decade absolute distance measurements , so is almost negligible for practical measurements of @xmath25 .",
    "this means that a direct measurement of @xmath120 can immediately predict @xmath27 with very little dependence on cosmological parameters @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "multiplying this by a bao measurement of @xmath56 from a galaxy redshift survey thus measures @xmath25 in comoving mpc , based entirely on low - redshift data .",
    "this can then be compared with a cmb - only prediction of @xmath23 for a _ zero parameter _",
    "test of our early universe assumptions : if the local @xmath25 measured from baos and @xmath7 as above is not consistent with the @xmath25 inferred from the cmb , something is definitely wrong with one or more measurements , or the early - universe assumptions or the frw framework ; tuning of the late - time cosmological parameters @xmath123 within the @xmath124 wmap - allowed ranges can not significantly help .",
    "conversely if a bottom - up measurement of @xmath25 does agree at the @xmath125 percent level with the cmb prediction , this would provide simple and compelling support for the standard set of early - universe assumptions .",
    "we next discuss some questions in both the cmb and local methods for measuring @xmath25 .",
    "here we consider the effect of non - standard radiation density , which is an important degeneracy for all cmb - determined length scales .",
    "this is moderately well - known , first analysed for the bao case by @xcite , and also in e.g. @xcite , but we give a slightly different and hopefully more intuitive explanation compared to previous work .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is given from the wmap data alone as 153 mpc with 2  percent precision , just assuming standard radiation content but no assumptions about flatness or dark energy . however ,",
    "if the assumption of standard radiation content is dropped , the precision degrades radically to @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "the reason is mainly the strong degeneracy between matter density @xmath45 and radiation density @xmath127 in the cmb fits : the first three cmb peaks determine the redshift of matter / radiation equality @xmath128 well , with @xmath129 , but converting to the physical matter density",
    "@xmath45 then relies on an assumption of the total radiation density .    the radiation density is conventionally parametrised by an effective number of neutrino species @xmath13 in the cmb era , defined via @xmath130\\ ] ] ( here for non - negligible neutrino mass",
    ", @xmath127 is not the present - day radiation density , but the value at @xmath128 rescaled by @xmath131 .",
    "we set @xmath132 to include dark matter and baryons only , excluding any low - redshift contribution from neutrino mass ) .",
    "most analyses assume a standard value very close to @xmath133 effective neutrino species @xcite which gives @xmath134 ; and the photon density @xmath135 is set by the very accurate cmb temperature , @xmath136 .",
    "however , we note that there already some hints of a higher value of @xmath13 from e.g. @xcite ; these are not yet decisive , but are very interesting .    for general @xmath13 ,",
    "the above can be rearranged into @xmath137\\ ] ]      here we review in more detail the effect of non - standard @xmath13 on cosmological parameter estimates , and show essentially that this creates a degeneracy in overall scale factor which affects all cosmic distances , times and densities , but has very little effect on dimensionless ratios .",
    "it is helpful to rearrange the expression for the sound horizon ( e.g. eq.6 of @xcite ) in terms of @xmath128 , @xmath127 and @xmath46 as the input parameters , which gives @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the baryon / photon momentum density ratio , and @xmath140 , @xmath141 are the values at @xmath142 , @xmath128 respectively .",
    "this shows that if we vary @xmath127 while holding @xmath128 , @xmath142 , and @xmath46 all fixed , the sound horizon scales simply @xmath143 . in more detail ,",
    "the wmap best - fit values show small changes in @xmath142 and @xmath46 with varying @xmath13 , see sec  4.7 of @xcite for details : however , the consequential shifts in @xmath23 are some @xmath144 smaller than the dominant @xmath145 shift , so we ignore those for simplicity .",
    "next for illustration we take a specific example of two models , an arbitrary model a with @xmath133 and parameters assumed a good fit to wmap , and a model b with one extra neutrino species ( or equivalent in dark radiation ) , thus @xmath146 but the same @xmath128 .",
    "thus , model b has both @xmath127 and @xmath45 larger by 13.4  percent , while the sound horizon in b is smaller by a factor close to @xmath147",
    ". this would be severely discrepant with the observed position of the cmb acoustic peaks via the acoustic scale @xmath148 , if either the distance to last - scattering @xmath149 or @xmath0 were held fixed .",
    "however , if we also choose model b to have increased @xmath150 by the same factor of 1.134 above , then via @xmath151 model b has @xmath0 increased by 6.5  percent while all of @xmath1 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath10 are identical in models a and b. since the expansion function @xmath154 depends only on the upper ",
    "case @xmath155 values above , @xmath156 remains unchanged at all redshifts ; so * all * cosmic distance@xmath157 and @xmath158 functions are reduced by @xmath159 in model b relative to a , but distance _ ratios _ between any two redshifts ( related to bao and snia observables and the cmb acoustic angle ) remain unchanged .",
    "( we note here that @xmath46 and @xmath160 are assumed unchanged between models a and b , so @xmath161 and @xmath162 are reduced by 13 percent in model b , but these do not appear separately in the friedmann equation . the implied value of @xmath163 will also be slightly different for model b as shown by wmap , but we do not consider that here ) .",
    "what is happening here is simple : apart from @xmath46 , wmap mainly constrains dimensionless quantities : especially @xmath128 , the acoustic scale @xmath148 at last scattering @xmath164 , and the shift parameter @xmath165 .",
    "also , bao measurements are intrinsically dimensionless ratios such as @xmath56 , while supernova measurements anchored to the local hubble flow also give dimensionless ratios , essentially @xmath166 or @xmath167 ( while @xmath0 is degenerate with the standardised sn luminosity ) .",
    "all these above provide precision measurements of the uppercase @xmath155 values and @xmath2 with no overall scale needed .",
    "but , there are three dimensionful quantities ( lengths , times and densities , or combinations of these ) in homogeneous cosmology ; while there are _ two _ inter - relations : distances and times are related by the known @xmath168 , and the friedmann equation relates densities to expansion rate , via @xmath169 .",
    "this implies that even excellent knowledge of all those dimensionless ratios above is not sufficient to solve for any dimensionful quantity ; but adding a measurement of _ any one _ cosmological length , time , or absolute density of matter , radiation or dark energy ( in si units or equivalent ) would be sufficient to constrain all the others .",
    "usually , this dimensionful quantity is ( implicitly ) set by assuming @xmath170 , which fixes @xmath127 and thus all the other scales : but if this assumption is dropped , then wmap+bao+sne observations leave us short by one dimensionful quantity , and the @xmath13 vs @xmath0 degeneracy appears .",
    "given the above , it is convenient to define the scaled radiation density as @xmath171 so that the standard value is 1 ; and also to choose a fundamental parameter set including @xmath172 plus optional parameters @xmath122 defaulting to @xmath173 ; as usual @xmath174 .",
    "this set couples very naturally to the observables , and turns both @xmath45 and @xmath0 into derived parameters , via @xmath175    currently , the observational uncertainty on @xmath176 is substantially larger than on the other major parameters : the central value depends somewhat on choice of datasets , with some datasets favouring @xmath177 ( e.g. @xcite ) , while others prefer the standard @xmath178 ( e.g. @xcite ) . there is broad agreement that @xmath179 , which maps to @xmath180 .",
    "we find from wmap results that if we allow @xmath181 , then current cosmological measurements mainly constrain the combinations @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 ; all these dimensionful observables have error bars dominated by the uncertainty in @xmath176 , while most dimensionless ratios are nearly uncorrelated with @xmath176 ( the main exceptions are @xmath186 and @xmath163 , which both show small positive correlations with @xmath176 ) .",
    "this simple scaling accurately reproduces the degeneracy track of @xmath187 vs @xmath13 shown by @xcite .",

    "the true dimensionless quantities such as @xmath128 , @xmath1 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath148 , @xmath194 , etc , have values independent of any system of units ) .    to break the above degeneracy , it is sufficient to get an accurate measurement of _ any one _ dimensionful observable such as @xmath0 , @xmath187 , @xmath25 or an absolute distance @xmath53 to any redshift .",
    "( a purely local measurement of @xmath127 , @xmath45 or @xmath195 would also suffice , but appears impossible ) .",
    "other possibilities include the cmb damping tail ( see below ) at @xmath196 , which brings in the silk damping length as a new dimensionful quantity which has different scaling with @xmath176 .",
    "of the various dimensionful parameters above , @xmath0 is clearly the most familiar from history , but to constrain @xmath13 it is actually preferable to measure @xmath25 : because @xmath197 is well constrained by cmb data alone , independent of late - time dark energy and curvature .",
    "in contrast , @xmath198 is well constrained by wmap+bao data _ if we assume _ flatness and @xmath199 , but the constraints become significantly worse if we allow curvature and/or arbitrary dark energy evolution . therefore , measuring the absolute length @xmath25 is the best route to probe @xmath13 and the early universe ; while combining cmb data with an accurate local @xmath0 measurement mainly constrains one degenerate combination of @xmath13 , @xmath2 and @xmath10 .    to illustrate this more clearly",
    ", the concordance model values of @xmath200 and @xmath201 shift to @xmath202 and 144 mpc respectively if we assume @xmath15cdm with @xmath203 .",
    "if the latter is the actual cosmology , an observed lower bound @xmath204 could be fitted with any of @xmath177 , or @xmath178 with @xmath205 and/or open curvature ; but a direct upper bound @xmath206 would exclude all of the currently allowed range for @xmath178 , and decisively _ require _ extra radiation or some other new physics at @xmath24 .    also , it is helpful to compare the @xmath13/scale degeneracy to the better - known geometrical degeneracy affecting parameter fitting from the cmb alone @xcite . although both degeneracies affect @xmath0 , the geometrical degeneracy involves holding fixed physical densities of both matter and radiation ( thus fixed @xmath25 ) , while trading off two of @xmath1 , @xmath207 , @xmath2 so as to maintain a fixed angular distance to last - scattering @xmath149 ; this is well broken by bao ratios , as we see below .",
    "the @xmath13/scale degeneracy above also holds @xmath128 fixed , but rescales densities and distances by @xmath176 and @xmath208 respectively ; here both @xmath149 and @xmath209 shift by a common factor .",
    "this @xmath13/scale degeneracy is _ not _ broken by bao distance - ratios , but is broken with an _ absolute _ bao length measurement . therefore ,",
    "these two degeneracies are `` orthogonal '' concerning @xmath25 , but get mixed in @xmath0 , which explains why @xmath25 is a cleaner test of the early universe .      here",
    "we find a strikingly simple route to @xmath1 , accurate to better than 1 percent : first it is convenient to define @xmath210 so the function @xmath211 is defined to be the ( small ) correction to approximation ( [ eq : dvh ] ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : dvh ] .",
    "then , taking an observed bao ratio @xmath40 , substituting eq .",
    "[ eq : rsound ] and using @xmath212 , we obtain @xmath213 this is exact apart from non - linear shifts of @xmath25 .",
    "all the terms above are clearly dimensionless : both @xmath0 and @xmath127 have cancelled , and there is only a small implicit dependence on @xmath127 via very small changes in @xmath142 .",
    "the last three factors on the rhs above are well constrained given only @xmath128 and @xmath46 from wmap , which are almost independent of dark energy , curvature or radiation density .",
    "adopting @xmath214 , the rhs above is very well approximated by @xmath215 with the uncertainty due to @xmath46 below 0.4 percent .    a precise moderate - redshift bao measurement from sdss is given by @xcite as @xmath216 ;",
    "thus the lhs above is @xmath217 .",
    "this , together with @xmath218 and neglecting the sub - percent @xmath211 term gives @xmath219 ; simply squaring this and rearranging gives a linear relation ( for @xmath199 ) of @xmath220 , in excellent agreement with the full likelihood results .",
    "there is a common rule - of - thumb that `` cmb measures @xmath45 and the baos measure @xmath0 '' ; we see from the above that this is _ only _ valid assuming the standard @xmath221 .",
    "for general radiation density , the cmb is really measuring @xmath128 , not @xmath45 : adding a low - redshift bao measurement then measures primarily @xmath1 , with a small sensitivity to @xmath10 and @xmath2 creeping in via the @xmath222 term .",
    "combining @xmath128 and @xmath1 gives us a value for @xmath198 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hzeq ] ) , again with mild dependence on @xmath223 , but does not give an absolute scale .",
    "( the additional information from the large - scale bend in the galaxy power spectrum is discussed in appendix  b ) .",
    "here we discuss some considerations on observational issues and the realistic precision available for measurements of the absolute bao length , both locally and from future cmb measurements .      given a measurement of @xmath56 from baos in a redshift survey , we need an absolute measurement of @xmath120 to apply eq .",
    "[ eq : dvapp2 ] and obtain an absolute measurement of @xmath25 independent of the cmb .",
    "the most obvious route to measure @xmath120 is to combine a local distance - ladder measurement of @xmath0 with a large sample of type - ia supernovae centred at redshift near @xmath224 to measure @xmath120 ; along with approximation  [ eq : dvapp2 ] this provides a direct calibration of @xmath27 and thus @xmath25 .",
    "doing this at fairly low redshift has several advantages : firstly , it is observationally much cheaper to accumulate a large sample of supernovae at @xmath11 compared with @xmath225 , and such a sample should arise naturally from the ongoing panstarrs medium deep survey @xcite and the dark energy survey @xcite .",
    "also , lower redshift provides a smaller lever - arm for possible time evolution of the mean supernova brightness , minimising systematic errors .",
    "given an overabundance of supernovae ( e.g. several hundred in the relevant redshift bin ) , one can afford to subdivide the sample by lightcurve stretch , host galaxy type etc , to provide consistency checks .",
    "also , there is growing evidence that sne ia are closest to standard candles in the rest - frame near - ir wavelengths , specifically the j and h passbands @xcite . at @xmath226",
    "these bands redshift into observed h and @xmath227 respectively , so that redshift is a sweet - spot which minimises k - corrections .",
    "we note here that this is significantly different to the more common case of computing dark energy figures of merit ; in the dark energy case , breaking degeneracies between @xmath228 and dark energy parameters @xmath229 requires relative distance measurements spanning a broad range of redshift @xmath230 ; for supernovae anchored to local samples at @xmath231 , sne at higher redshift have greater leverage on @xmath232 and especially @xmath233 .",
    "since baos are anchored in the cmb , the preference for higher redshift is weaker than for sne , but the rapid increase in available cosmic volume still favours redshifts @xmath234 for precision measurements of @xmath232 and @xmath233 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above , for an absolute @xmath25 measurement we only need to measure an absolute distance @xmath7 to one specific redshift matched to a given bao survey : the overall @xmath25 accuracy is simply the quadrature sum of the bao and @xmath7 errors , with a small addition from the error in eq .",
    "[ eq : dvapp2 ] , but there is no lever - arm gain towards higher redshift .",
    "thus , the number of required sne for given precision on @xmath7 is independent of the target redshift ; thus low redshifts are both observationally cheaper , and more robust against systematics such as time evolution and imperfect @xmath235corrections .",
    "one major benefit of our approximation [ eq : dvapp2 ] is that there is _ no explicit dependence _ on @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , if we can measure @xmath53 to @xmath236 using some physical - based method which does not rely on calibration via the local distance ladder and @xmath0 , we automatically bypass the uncertainties in the local distance scale .",
    "there are several current or proposed methods for doing this , including gravitational lens time - delays , sunyaev - zeldovich measurements of galaxy clusters , and the expanding - photosphere method applied to type - ii supernovae ; however , all of these methods have some level of model dependence and it is not yet clear whether they can reach the percent level absolute accuracy ( e.g. 2  percent accuracy for a @xmath124 detection of one additional neutrino species ) .",
    "the lens time - delay method is especially clear at low lens redshift ; while lensing observables involve a combination of lens and source distances @xmath237 and @xmath238 , selecting systems with @xmath239 makes the ratio @xmath240 close to unity and well constrained , which is favourable for absolute measurement of the lens distance .",
    "potentially the ultimate @xmath7 calibration method is the detection of gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries @xcite , since the model waveforms can be predicted extremely precisely assuming only einstein gravity , and the method is completely immune to dust extinction or astrophysical nuisance parameters .",
    "of course , such events have not been directly observed so far , but the observations of binary pulsars @xcite leave no doubt that the waves exist , and there are ongoing upgrades to advanced ligo and virgo which should give a near - certain detection of binary inspirals around 2015 , assuming they reach their design sensitivity .",
    "these second - generation gw experiments will probably provide only modest @xmath7 accuracy for most events ; however , if we are lucky there may be a few `` golden events '' with high signal to noise , such as massive black hole events at @xmath241 . in the longer term",
    ", there is an ongoing design study for a third - generation ground - based gravitational wave observatory called `` einstein telescope '' @xcite for the post2025 era ; this is projected to detect binary neutron - star mergers to @xmath242 , and neutron - star + black hole mergers to @xmath243 .",
    "for the closest merger events at @xmath244 , einstein telescope would provide very high snr and percent - level absolute accuracy on @xmath7 for each event .",
    "if these can be tied to a unique galaxy , or statistically tied to a given cluster or sheet of galaxies , redshift constraints will be quite precise .",
    "the future of gw distance measurements is naturally quite uncertain : however , one feature is generic : since the method is largely limited by instrumental snr not astrophysical scatter , the closest gw inspirals should always provide the best distance precision per event .",
    "furthermore , the closer inspirals lead to much smaller position error ellipsoids , and make it much easier to identify an optical counterpart , or statistically identify the host galaxy in a group or cluster .",
    "( assuming the relative distance and angular errors for a gw inspiral scale @xmath245 1/snr , then the comoving volume of the gw error box scales approximately as @xmath246 ; this results in fewer candidate host galaxies per burst at low redshift , by a very steep factor ) .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is quite generic that for any cosmological distance estimate , the best prospects for percent - level absolute accuracy on @xmath53 tend to occur at modest redshift @xmath57 : this is distant enough for galaxy peculiar velocities to be a small effect , but close enough to give high signal / noise ratio and minimal nuisances from possible time evolution and uncorrectable gravitational lensing effects . until the distant future when we can get cosmological distance measurements with significantly better than 1  percent absolute accuracy , then a low redshift will be preferred for anchoring the absolute bao length .      in the near future",
    ", planck data is expected to improve the precision on @xmath128 to around 1  percent ; assuming all the `` standard '' early universe conditions ( i.e. gr , standard radiation with @xmath133 , negligible early dark energy , etc ) , this will determine the sound horizon to @xmath247 percent precision , which is significantly better than any foreseen direct distance measurement .",
    "so , why bother measuring @xmath25 locally ?",
    "if instead @xmath13 is treated as free , planck will still measure @xmath197 to 0.3  percent , but the error on @xmath176 will dominate : the planck measurements of the cmb damping tail ( peaks 4,5,6 ) will provide a useful constraint on @xmath13 , but a plausible uncertainty of @xmath248 in @xmath13 from planck is equivalent to @xmath249 percent in @xmath176 and @xmath250 percent in @xmath25 ; this is around @xmath251 worse than the standard - radiation case , and moderate - redshift bao and distance measurements can potentially be competitive or better than this accuracy .",
    "furthermore , the fitting of the radiation density from the cmb relies on fairly subtle and smooth suppression of power in the cmb damping tail @xcite ; this effect is significantly degenerate with other possible adjustable parameters , including changes in primordial helium abundance @xmath252 and non - zero running of the primordial spectral index @xmath253 @xcite , ( and also with possible experimental systematics such as imperfect modelling of beam sidelobes ) . in cmb analyses , @xmath13 , @xmath254 and @xmath253",
    "are generally fitted one - at - a - time with the other two fixed to `` standard '' values ; however , if two or three of these are simultaneously free , the cmb - only constraints on @xmath23 may well be significantly worse than @xmath255 percent ; while the local bao route above can provide a direct measure of @xmath25 which is practically theory  independent .    therefore , although cosmic variance means that local bao measurements can not compete with the 0.3  percent best - case planck precision on @xmath25 , this is not a major drawback : a local measurement of @xmath25 to 12 percent absolute accuracy would still be of major benefit for cosmology , and could detect or exclude various early - universe effects such as non - standard @xmath13 with high significance ; this method is independent of early - universe uncertainties including @xmath254 and spectral index running which may potentially hamper the planck measurement of @xmath13 .",
    "another motivation is that the value of @xmath13 from the cmb is somewhat degenerate with the primordial spectral index @xmath186 and @xmath256 ( e.g. @xcite ) : this can have major implications for constraining the early universe and inflation theory . if @xmath13 is fixed to 4.04 rather than the standard value 3.04 , the wmap best - fit value of @xmath186 moves up from @xmath257 to @xmath258 to compensate ; this is a small change , but is potentially very important because the scale - invariant value of 1.00 is then no longer ruled out at high significance .",
    "a constraint on @xmath13 directly from the absolute length @xmath25 is almost independent of the primordial power spectrum , and is therefore extremely valuable .    in principle",
    "we can achieve better precision by going to a higher redshift bao survey to reduce cosmic variance , e.g. euclid should measure the transverse bao angle @xmath259 to better than 0.4 percent in many bins between @xmath260 @xcite . adding a 0.4 percent distance measurement to a matching redshift , this could measure @xmath13 to around @xmath261 precision , which is substantially better than planck .",
    "however , a sub  percent absolute distance to such a redshift currently appears extremely challenging given the potential systematics : thus the low - redshift route outlined above remains a promising intermediate step .",
    "the considerations above on distance measurements and cmb degeneracies provide a very strong motivation for obtaining the best possible bao measurements at modest @xmath263 , approaching the cosmic variance limit .",
    "the ongoing boss project is a large step in this direction , but there are several potential improvements : firstly of course boss only covers around 1/4 of the entire sky , so adding coverage of the southern hemisphere is very useful ; secondly , sampling a somewhat higher space density of galaxies can improve reconstruction of the bao peak , and thirdly we may expand the survey to lower galactic latitudes for maximal sky coverage .    until recently , galaxy surveys have disfavoured low galactic latitudes due to both extinction problems and increased stellar contamination ( e.g. from blended images which are hard to morphologically classify ) .",
    "however , the recently completed wise mid - ir survey combined with the ongoing vista hemisphere survey should provide a galaxy sample of ample depth , and minimal sensitivity to galactic extinction which could push down to @xmath264 .",
    "availability of optical+near - ir colours can also greatly improve the star - galaxy separation , so stellar contamination should remain manageable . the cosmic - variance limits on bao measurements",
    "have been calculated by @xcite ; for 3/4 of the full sky and realistic reconstruction methods , interpolation from their figure  3 predicts precision @xmath265 percent on @xmath266 ; this accuracy is similar to optimistic projections for local @xmath0 measurements .",
    "such a bao survey is comfortably within reach of proposed high - multiplex multi - object spectrographs such as 4most on the vista telescope , or despec at ctio .",
    "the required area is very large , but the target density @xmath267 galaxies per deg@xmath268 is rather low , so such an observing program would only take a modest fraction of the total number of fibres , and could be run in a simultaneous mode in parallel with stellar and other surveys .    furthermore , an accurate low - redshift bao measurement , when compared to a radial bao measurement at @xmath269 , can provide a clean smoking  gun test of cosmic acceleration entirely from the two bao measurements @xcite ; that test is independent of supernovae , cmb data and general relativity .",
    "bao measurements at @xmath225 are necessary but not sufficient for this test , since very little acceleration happened earlier than @xmath270 .",
    "measuring the absolute rather than relative bao length scale forms a powerful test of standard early - universe cosmology , especially probing the radiation density along with other possible non - standard effects at @xmath24 .    as a step in this direction , we have found a simple and highly accurate approximation ( eq .  [ eq : dvapp2 ] ) relating the bao dilation scale @xmath27 to the luminosity distance @xmath7 at a slightly higher redshift .",
    "this is accurate to @xmath271 percent at @xmath119 for all plausible wmap - compatible friedmann models , including modest curvature and time - varying dark energy ; the inaccuracy is substantially smaller than the cosmic variance limit for low - redshift bao measurements . the approximation does not explicitly depend on @xmath0 , so remains applicable if there is any direct physics - based measurement of @xmath53 bypassing the local distance ladder .",
    "the only ways for eq .",
    "[ eq : dvapp2 ] to have percent - level errors are very radical , such as violation of the distance - duality relation @xmath272 , or a sharp phase transition in dark energy at low redshift , e.g. a sharp jump in @xmath273 causing a kink feature in @xmath69 .",
    "we also reviewed the degeneracy between radiation density and cosmic scales , and showed this is close to a rescaling of all dimensionful observables ( except baryon and photon densities ) , while leaving most dimensionless ratios unchanged .",
    "given realistic future observations , the approximation above can provide a high - precision calibration of the bao length scale using only low redshift data , which in turn provides a powerful test of standard @xmath24 cmb assumptions , and in particular a robust test of the radiation density independent of the cmb damping tail .",
    "a measurement of @xmath0 is also useful , but on its own does not fully break degeneracies : e.g. a high - precision measurement of @xmath0 significantly greater than @xmath274 would signal a problem for vanilla @xmath15cdm , but could indicate any one of @xmath205 , weak open curvature or increased radiation density , and without an absolute @xmath25 measurement it would be hard to discriminate these . in contrast , an absolute bao length measurement can cleanly detect or constrain non - standard pre - cmb physics , almost independent of late - time effects such as @xmath116 or weak curvature , and with minimal degeneracy with @xmath186 and running spectral index .",
    "this may also be important for inflation theory , since the currently strong evidence for @xmath275 becomes substantially weaker if @xmath13 is larger than the standard value .",
    "we can essentially distinguish two possibilities : if all the standard cmb assumptions are correct , then planck will determine @xmath23 better than the cosmic variance on the bao length : then an absolute bao length measurement essentially provides a strong null test of the standard cosmology at around 1 - 2 percent precision , but does not improve our error bars on @xmath1 , @xmath2 etc .",
    "however , if one or more of the standard early - universe assumptions is wrong , this can be absorbed into biased values of @xmath0 , and to a lesser extent @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in joint fits to cmb , bao , and supernova data alone .",
    "therefore , a direct low - redshift measurement of @xmath25 can be very powerful for discriminating early - universe modifications such as extra radiation or early dark energy , from late - time effects such as dark energy @xmath116 or small non - zero curvature .",

    "this also suggests that approximation  [ eq : dvapp1 ] should remain fairly accurate for modified - gravity models , as long as they are homogeneous , have weak curvature and @xmath299 not very different from the concordance model .",
    "finally we note that the square ",
    "bracket has value 14.25 for an einstein - de sitter model , and approximately 22 for a zero-@xmath15 open model , explaining the low - redshift limit of those models shown in figure  [ fig : dvapp1 ] .",
    "here we note that while bao parameter estimates are strongly dependent on correct deduction of @xmath128 from the cmb , the overall shape of the large - scale galaxy power spectrum does provide an independent check of this .",
    "the large - scale galaxy clustering pattern actually contains two key length scales , the bao length discussed above , and also the `` big bend '' scale which describes the overall broad - band shape of the galaxy power spectrum @xmath300 excluding the bao wiggles ; these two are approximately independent observables . assuming the primordial power spectrum is well described by a power - law",
    ", @xmath301 and the dark matter is cold or warm ( not hot ) , then fitting the `` big bend '' in a galaxy power spectrum essentially measures the comoving light horizon size @xmath302 at matter - radiation equality , again relative to @xmath27 at the characteristic redshift of the given survey : this gives @xmath303 which is not explicitly dependent on @xmath176 . for @xmath304 , at small @xmath3 the above has the well - known scaling @xmath305 , with a result @xmath306 which has remained consistent over many large galaxy surveys , since the first reliable estimate from the apm galaxy survey @xcite , through 2dfgrs @xcite and sdss @xcite .",
    "we see that the big - bend observable in ( [ eq : rh ] ) has the same @xmath307 factor as the bao ratio in ( [ eq : omez ] ) , but has a different dependence on @xmath128 . taking the ratio of these two characteristic lengths , we have @xmath308 here the second factor @xmath309 represents the weighted average sound speed @xmath310 prior to the drag redshift ; the given value is for the concordance model , but",
    "this term is very insensitive to reasonable parameter variations .",
    "the first term above depends only on the ratio @xmath311 , and scales approximately @xmath312 around the concordance model ; there is no separate dependence on @xmath1 , @xmath188 and @xmath176 , so this ratio is predicted robustly given just @xmath128 from wmap alone .    due to various uncertainties in overall @xmath300 shape from possible effects such as scale - dependent bias , non - linearity , redshift - space distortions , neutrino masses , running of @xmath186 etc",
    ", this bao / bend ratio seems unlikely to independently measure @xmath128 to a precision comparable to the current 4  percent precision from wmap , and still less the 1  percent expected from planck .",
    "however , the fact that parameters estimated from cmb+bao also provide a reasonable fit to the overall @xmath300 shape provides a valuable consistency check , which the concordance model passes @xcite .",
    "this strongly argues that the wmap - only estimate of @xmath128 _ can not _ have a gross error from unknown physics , unless there has been a fortuitous cancellation of effects .",
    "the above also shows that measuring @xmath313 in dimensionless units rescaled by the bao length may be helpful for testing for neutrino masses or non - standard physics around @xmath314 , since this is very robust against shifts in @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath176 ."
