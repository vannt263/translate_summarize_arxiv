    "the generation of new states of the light field turned out to be an important topic in quantum optics in the last years , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum lithography @xcite , decoherence of states @xcite , etc .",
    "the usefulness and relevance of quantum states , to give a few examples , cover the study of i ) quantum decoherence effects in mesoscopic fields harochegato ; ii ) entangled states and quantum correlations @xcite ; interference in the phase space @xcite ; collapses and revivals of the atomic inversion @xcite ; engineering of ( quantum states ) reservoir @xcite ; etc . also , it is worth mentioning the importance of the statistical properties of one state to determine some relevant properties of another @xcite as well as using specific quantum states as input to engineer a desired state @xcite .",
    "here we introduce a truncated state having random coefficients ( tsrc ) .",
    "this state is characterized by a constant phase relation between the relative fock states , but with coefficients describing probability amplitudes obtained through some random number generator .",
    "features of this state are studied by analyzing several of its statistical properties .",
    "we believe the tsrc can be a useful tool to test sequence of numbers whose generation is unknown from the observer .",
    "indeed , preliminary results have corroborated this expectation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the tsrc and section iii we analyze the behaviour of some statistical properties of the tsrc when the hilbert space is increased . in section",
    "iv we show how to engineer tsrc in the running - wave domain , and section v is devoted to the study of losses due to nonidealities of the detectors in the whole process of engineering .",
    "finally , in section vi we present our conclusions .",
    "we define the tsrc as @xmath0where @xmath1 is a normalization constant and @xmath2 is a random complex coefficient ( polar form ) , given by some random number generator ( rng ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that tsrc differs from ( mixed ) thermal states ( mts ) and pure states having thermal photon distribution ( pstd)@xcite , since these states have an algorithm for the coefficients @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , although tsrc is a pure state , its statistical properties are very different from the pstd : for example , the tsrc does not exhibit squeezing for @xmath4 , as shown in the next section .",
    "since the expansion of tsrc is known in the number state @xmath5 , we have @xmath6fig . @xmath7",
    "show the plots of the photon - number distribution , @xmath8 versus @xmath9 , for tsrc .",
    "although the generation of  the tsrc be virtually impossible for hilbert space dimensions @xmath10 , due to nonidealities of beam splitters and detectors causing decoherence effects as well as due to low success probability ( see section iv ) , it can be useful to study the behavior of tsrc for large @xmath11 , specially when we are interested in investigate the properties of sequence of numbers @xcite .",
    "fig@xmath12 , which is a expanded view of the fig .",
    "@xmath13 , shows the same behavior of that of the fig.@xmath14 . as expected , when @xmath11 is large enough ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the difference from one peak to another becomes negligible . for small values of @xmath15 , running the rng several times will give different sets of numbers with different @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , it is important to keep in mind that our proposal to generate tsrc is based on a particular set of numbers obtained by a single run of the rng .",
    "thus , these numbers , having no algorithm producing them , a question emerging is : what type of properties will characterize a state having a random probability amplitude ? these properties will be investigated in the next subsections .     of tsrc versus",
    "n for the dimension of hilbert space @xmath17 .",
    "this figure was obtained by a single run of the rng.,width=283,height=283 ]      the average number @xmath18 as well as the variance in tsrc is obtained directly from @xmath19and    @xmath20    fig .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 show the plots of @xmath18 and @xmath23 as a function of the hilbert space dimension @xmath11 .",
    "note from fig.@xmath24 that @xmath25 increases irregularly with @xmath11 when a single realization is considered , but tends to increase linearly with @xmath11 when several realizations are considered . as can be seen from fig.@xmath22 ,",
    "the increasing of @xmath23 with @xmath11 is irregular , irrespective of the number of realizations .",
    "mandel q parameter is defined as    @xmath26    while the second order correlation function @xmath27 is @xmath28and for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) the state is said to be sub - poissonian ( super - poissonian ) .",
    "also , the @xmath31 parameter and the second order correlation function @xmath32 are related by @xcite @xmath33 \\left\\langle \\hat{n}\\right\\rangle \\text{. }   \\label{qg}\\]]it is well known that if @xmath34  then the glauber - sudarshan p - function assumes negative values , thus differing from usual probability distribution function . beside that , by eq .",
    "( [ qg ] ) is readily seen that @xmath34 implies @xmath29 .",
    "as for a coherent state @xmath35 , a state is said to be a classical  one if @xmath30 .",
    "fig . @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath37 show the plots of the @xmath31 parameter and the correlation function @xmath27 versus @xmath11 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the tsrc is predominantly super - poissonian ( @xmath30 and @xmath38 ) , then being a classical  state in this aspect , for @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , for small values of  @xmath11 ( @xmath39 ) , the @xmath31 parameter presents significant occurrence of values less than @xmath40 , showing sub - poissonian statistics and thus being associated with a quantum state .",
    "however , when @xmath11 becomes larger than @xmath41 , tsrcbecomes super - poissonian .",
    "also , note that for a single realization of the rng these both functions present an oscillatory behavior , while , for several realizations , fig.@xmath36 ( solid line ) shows an interesting linear dependence between @xmath31 and @xmath11 .",
    "this will be further investigated in the following subsection . on the other hand",
    ", fig.@xmath37 indicates an asymptotic behavior of @xmath42 when @xmath11 is increased . for @xmath43 , we find @xmath44 .",
    "quadrature operators are defined as @xmath45where @xmath46 ( @xmath47 )  is the annihilation ( creation ) operator in fock space .",
    "quantum effects arise when the variance of one of the two quadrature attains a value @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 show the plots of quadrature variance @xmath52 versus @xmath11 .",
    "note the same oscillatory behavior when a single realization of rng is considered . for small @xmath11 ( @xmath39 ) ,  tsrc exhibits squeezing with a significant frequency ( running rng several times ) . on the other hand , when @xmath53 increases , squeezing becomes a rare event , and can be set a null event for @xmath4 , coinciding with the departure from sub - poissonian statistic discussed above .",
    "@xmath54 shows the plots of shannon entropy @xmath55 versus @xmath11 .",
    "it shows a steady increasing of  @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , increasing @xmath11 arbitrarily , we have found no bound for @xmath56 , thus indicating no maximum for shannon entropy .",
    "the husimi q - function for tsrc is given by @xmath57fig.@xmath58 shows the husimi q - function for @xmath59 .",
    "it is to be noted that this function will change each time we run the rng even for a fixed @xmath11 .",
    "thus , as remarked above , we refer to a particular fixed set of numbers assumed as having no law generating them .",
    "schemes for generation of an arbitrary state can be found in various contexts , as for example trapped ions @xcite and cavity qed serra , vogel .",
    "however , due to the severe limitation imposed by coherence loss and damping , we will employ the scheme introduced by dakna et al .",
    "dakna in the realm of running wave field . for brevity",
    ", the present application only shows the relevant steps of ref.@xcite , where the reader will find more details . in this scheme , a desired state @xmath60 composed of a finite number of fock states",
    "@xmath5 can be written as@xmath61where @xmath62 stands for the displacement operator and the @xmath63 are the roots of the polynomial equation @xmath64    according to the experimental setup shown in the fig.1 of ref.@xcite , we have ( assuming @xmath40-photon registered in all detectors ) the outcome@xmath65where @xmath66 is the transmittance of the beam splitter and @xmath67 are experimental parameters . after some algebra , the eq.([teorica ] ) and",
    "eq.([experimental ] ) can be connected . in this way",
    ", one shows that they become identical when @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .    in the present case",
    "the coefficients @xmath71 are given by those of the tsrc .",
    "as stressed before , when @xmath72 , squeezing is lost and tsrc has its sub - poissonian statistics changed to a super - poissonian one .",
    "thus , in the following , when considering values of  @xmath11 it can be interesting to take into account these two boundaries .",
    "table i and ii show the roots @xmath73 of the characteristic polynomial in eq.([raizes ] ) and the displacement parameters @xmath74 for @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the probability of successfully engineering tsrc , @xmath77 , diminish with the number @xmath11 , as is true for any state .",
    "@xmath78| _ k| @xmath79__k@xmath79| _",
    "k| @xmath79__k@xmath80    @xmath78| _ k| @xmath79__k@xmath79| _",
    "k| @xmath79__k@xmath81    for @xmath75 , @xmath82 .",
    "the beam - splitter transmittance which optimizes this probability is @xmath83 . for @xmath76 , @xmath84 and",
    "the optimized beam - splitter transmittance is @xmath85 .",
    "in the prior sections we have assumed ideal detectors and beam - splitters .",
    "although very good beam - splitters are available by advanced technology ( losses by absorption lesser than @xmath86 ) , the same is not true for photo - detectors in the optical domain .",
    "thus , we now take into account the quantum efficiency @xmath87 at the photodetectors . for this purpose",
    ", we use the langevin operator technique as introduced in @xcite to obtain the fidelity to get the tsrc .",
    "output operators accounting for the detection of a given field @xmath88 reaching the detectors are given by @xcite    @xmath89    where @xmath87 stands for the efficiency of the detector and @xmath90 , acting on the environment states , is the noise ( or langevin ) operator associated with losses into the detectors placed in the path of modes @xmath91 .",
    "we assume that the detectors couple neither different modes @xmath92 nor the langevin operators @xmath93,@xmath94 thus , the following commutation relations are readily obtained from eq.([e9 ] ) :    @xmath95 & = & 1-\\eta ,   \\label{e10a } \\\\ \\left [ \\widehat{\\mathsf{l}}_{\\alpha } , \\widehat{\\mathsf{l}}_{\\beta } ^{\\dagger } \\right ] & = & 0\\text { , }   \\label{e10b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which give rise to following ground - state expectation values for pairs of langevin operators :    @xmath96    these are useful relations specially for optical frequencies , when the state of the environment can be very well approximated by the vacuum state , even for room temperature .",
    "let us now apply the scheme of the ref.@xcite to the present case .",
    "for simplicity we will assume all detectors having high efficiency ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this assumption allows us to simplify the resulting expression by neglecting terms of order higher than @xmath98 .",
    "when we do that , instead of the ideal @xmath99 , we find the mixed state @xmath100where , for brevity , we have omitted the kets corresponding to the environment .",
    "here @xmath101 is the reflectance of the beam splitter , @xmath102 is the identity operator , and @xmath103 , @xmath104 stands for losses in the first , second @xmath105 n-@xmath106 detector .",
    "although the @xmath107 commute with any system operator , we have maintained the order above to keep clear the set of possibilities for photo absorption : the first term , which includes @xmath108 , indicates the probability for nonabsorption ; the second term , which include @xmath109 , indicates the probability for absorption in the first detector ; and so on .",
    "note that in case of absorption at the k-@xmath106 detector , the annihilation operator @xmath46 is replaced by the @xmath110 creation langevin operator .",
    "other possibilities such as absorption in more than one detector lead to a probability of order lesser than @xmath111 , which are neglected .",
    "next , we have to compute the fidelity @xcite , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the ideal state given by eq.([experimental ] ) , here corresponding to our ccs characterized by the parameters shown in table 1 , and @xmath114 is the ( mixed ) state given in the eq.([damped ] ) . assuming @xmath115 @xmath116 and @xmath117 we find , for @xmath75 ( @xmath118 ) , @xmath119 @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) and @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) , respectively .",
    "these high values of fidelities show that efficiencies around @xmath124 lead to states whose degradation due to losses is not so dramatic .",
    "in this paper we introduce a new state of the quantized electromagnetic field , the truncated state with random coefficients ( tsrc ) . to characterize the tsrc , we have studied several of its statistical properties as well as the behaviour of these statistical properties when the dimension @xmath11 of hilbert space is increased . by studying the dependence of the @xmath31-parameter and of the second order correlation function with increasing @xmath11",
    ", we found that there exists a transition from sub - poissonian statistics to super - poissonian statistics when @xmath11 is relatively small ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "interesting , we have also found that for @xmath4 squeezing is rarely observed .",
    "other statistical properties such as shannon entropy , quadrature operator and their variances were investigated .",
    "we think  tsrc  can be used to characterize sequence of numbers generated deterministically .",
    "it would be interesting , for example , to compare tsrc properties with the properties of states whose coefficients stem from a sequence generated by iteration of the logistic equation .",
