    "vector fields play an important role on manifolds . in particular",
    "they allow the study of dynamics on the manifold . on metric spaces and in the absence of a differential structure ,",
    "the notion of arc fields was introduced in @xcite . under some regularity assumption ,",
    "the authors of @xcite proved the existence of solution curves for a time independent arc field .",
    "their result can be seen as an extension of the cauchy - lipschitz theorem .",
    "the goal of this paper is to define a notion of sum of two arc fields and construct a unique solution curve for this sum .",
    "we also generalize @xcite to the time dependent case .",
    "let us also mention that the generalization of the notion of differential equations from manifolds to metric spaces is a natural question . in this direction",
    ", there are many other approaches which can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a basic idea that all approaches have in common is to replace the concept of a vector field by a suitable family of curves ( herein called an arc field following @xcite ) each of which supplies the direction of travel at the point from which it issues .",
    "we borrow the idea of @xcite which shows the existence of flows corresponding time independent arc fields on locally complete metric spaces whereas all others have predominantly assumed that the underlying metric space is locally compact .",
    "let us now explain our motivation behind this work . in @xcite , we study systems coupling fluids and polymers . in it",
    "most generality the phase space for the polymers is given by a metric space ( see @xcite ) .",
    "when the phase space of the polymers is a manifold , we get a system coupling the navier - stokes equation for the fluid velocity with a fokker - planck equation describing the evolution of the polymer density ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the coupling comes from an extra stress term in the fluid equation due to the polymers .",
    "there is also a drift term in the fokker - planck equation that depends on the spatial gradient of fluid velocity .",
    "it can be seen that the fokker - planck equation has a flow structure on the set of probability densities of polymers .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath0 be the set of all borel probability measures defined on the manifold ( phase space of polymers ) then we can put a metric structure on @xmath0 using the wasserstein distance .",
    "once @xmath0 is equipped with the wasserstein distance , the fokker - planck equation can be considered as the sum of two flows on @xmath0 .",
    "one is the gradient flow corresponding to the entropy functional on @xmath0 and the other one is a drift term which is generated by the spatial gradient of the fluid velocity which depends on time .",
    "if the phase space of polymers is not a manifold but just a metric space then we do nt have fokker - planck equation any more .",
    "but the flow interpretation is still available to describe the evolution of the polymer density if we know how to generate and add flows on metric spaces .",
    "achieving this is one of the goal of this paper .",
    "we briefly summarize the contents of each section .",
    "in section 2 , we study time dependent arc fields , solution curves , and sufficient conditions under which we can prove the existence of solution curves for arc fields .",
    "we also show the continuous dependence of solutions on initial conditions from which we can get the uniqueness of the solution curve . in section 3 , we introduce the notion of solution curve for the sum of two arc fields . by imposing a kind of commutation law on two time dependent arc fields",
    ", we prove the existence of solution curves .",
    "we also get the uniqueness of a solution curve to the sum of two arc field by showing the continuous dependence of solution curves on the initial conditions .",
    "let @xmath1 be a locally complete metric space with a metric @xmath2 .",
    "a time dependent arc field on @xmath1 is a family of maps @xmath3\\rightarrow x$ ] such that for all @xmath4 we have @xmath5 @xmath6 and the function @xmath7 is locally bounded , namely for all @xmath8 , there exist @xmath9 such that @xmath10    one can interpret @xmath11 \\rightarrow x$ ] as a curve on @xmath1 starting from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
