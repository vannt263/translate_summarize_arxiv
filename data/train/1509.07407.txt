    "the last five terms in contain _ one factor _ of the loop momentum ( @xmath58 ) and after tracing vanish by the schouten identity , the loop integration does not spoil the cancellation . the contribution of the one but last five terms in the curly bracket does not vanish .",
    "it contains _ two factor _ of the loop momentum , and it is proportional to the schouten identity broken under the divergent loop integral . calculating it with the improved momentum cutoff of section 2 using the formulas of the appendix ( or with dreg ) we get the anomaly term    @xmath156    in the case of the naive substitution the schouten identity is satisfied , the curly bracket vanishes .",
    "( in that case with simple momentum cutoff the anomaly term originates from shifting the linearly divergent first two terms in , but the result depends on momentum routing . )",
    "the presented method identifies without ambiguity the value of the anomaly in the axial - vector current and leaves the vector currents anomaly free without any further assumptions .",
    "we have presented in this chapter a new method for the reliable calculation of divergent 1-loop diagrams ( even involving @xmath20 ) with four dimensional momentum cutoff .",
    "various conditions were derived to maintain gauge symmetry , to have the freedom of momentum routing or shifting the loop momentum .",
    "these conditions were known by several authors @xcite .",
    "our new proposal is that these conditions will be satisfied during the regularization process if terms proportional to loop momenta with even number of free lorentz indices ( e.g. @xmath157 ) are calculated according to the special identifications and or generalizations thereof . in the end",
    "the scalar integrals are calculated with a simple momentum cutoff .",
    "the calculation is robust - at least at 1-loop level - as we have shown via the fermionic contribution to the vacuum polarization function .",
    "the finite terms agree with the one in dimensional regularization in all examples .",
    "the connection with dreg is more transparent if one uses alternatively the @xmath158 or substitution and @xmath14 takes different values determined by the degree of divergence in each term ( [ eq : quad2 ] , [ eq : log2 ] , [ eq : fin2 ] ) .",
    "we stress that this new regularization stands without dreg as the substitutions , and scalar integration with a cutoff are independent of dreg . the success of both regularizations based on the property that they fulfill the consistency conditions of gauge invariance and momentum shifting .    at 1-loop",
    "the finite terms in the improved momentum cutoff are found to be equivalent with dreg . for practical calculations we propose to use the same renormalization scheme , @xmath159 or @xmath160 subtractions plus bphz forest formula as with dreg .",
    "dreg is not just the generally used method , but it is proved to be a mathematically rigorous regularization within the epstein - glaser framework @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the results of the proposed method and dreg gives a hint that the improved cutoff method with e.g. @xmath159 subtraction and bphz can be used as a renormalization scheme for more complicated diagrams .",
    "regularization schemes based on consistency conditions have been applied to more involved cases . constrained differential renormalization is useful in supersymmetric @xcite and non - abelian gauge theories",
    ", it fulfills slavnov - taylor identities at one and two loops @xcite .",
    "implicit regularization @xcite requires the same conditions as we used and it was successfully applied to the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite and to higher loop calculations in gauge theory .",
    "it was shown that the conditions guarantee gauge invariance generally and the ward identities are fulfilled explicitly in qed at two - loop order @xcite . in an effective composite higgs model , the fermion condensate model @xcite oblique radiative corrections ( s and t parameters ) were calculated in dreg and with the improved cutoff , too , the finite results completely agree .",
    "the calculation involved vacuum polarization functions with two different fermion masses and no ambiguity appeared @xcite .    as an application",
    "the triangle anomaly was calculated within the 4 dimensional improved momentum cutoff framework .",
    "the property that the loop - integrals are invariant under the shift of the loop momentum spoils the usual derivation of the abj anomaly in the presence of a cutoff .",
    "we calculated the trace corresponding to the triangle graphs of fig .",
    "( @xmath20 and six @xmath3 s ) and the ward identity ( @xmath20 and four @xmath3 s ) exploiting only the standard anticommutators of the @xmath3 matrices and not using the @xmath161 anticommuting relation .",
    "it turns out that different evaluations of the trace agree with each other if and only if @xmath1 does not always anticommute with @xmath2 , rather @xmath162 picks up terms proportional to the schouten identity if it is multiplied with five more @xmath3 s under the trace .",
    "the trace of the @xmath162 anticommutator multiplied with three @xmath3 s vanishes , as the definition of @xmath163 is unambiguous .",
    "the right hand side of is only non - vanishing if it is under a divergent loop momentum integral . in four dimensional field theory the nontrivial properties of @xmath1 and @xmath3 s",
    "appear first time in the divergent triangle diagram .",
    "traces involving @xmath1 and even number of @xmath3 s can be calculated in the same manner avoiding the anticommutation of @xmath2and @xmath1 .",
    "first the order of @xmath164 s are reversed applying then using the cyclicity of the trace we get back the original trace in the reversed order , the difference gives the trace twice . this way the @xmath162 anticommutator can be defined",
    ", it will not vanish generally . if it is multiplied with ( 2n+1 ) @xmath3 s it is equal to the sum of ( 2n+1 ) trace involving @xmath1 and ( 2n ) @xmath3 s , see .",
    "it is well known that the general properties of the trace and @xmath165 are in conflict with each other , this led to the t hooft - veltman scheme @xcite .",
    "our proposal similarly modifies @xmath162 but works in four dimensions and the modifications come into action only under divergent loop integrals involving enough number of @xmath3 matrices .",
    "there were attempts to preserve @xmath165 , but in that case the cyclicity of the trace was lost @xcite .",
    "we have shown with the new method that the vector currents are conserved and the axial vector current is anomalous , and no ambiguity appears .",
    "the new regularization is advantageous in special loop - calculations where one wants to remain in four dimensions , keep the cutoff of the model , like in effective theories , in derivation of renormalization group equations , in extra dimensional scenarios or in models explicitly depending on the space - time dimensions , like supersymmetric theories .",
    "similar approaches succeeded in the calculation of the anomalous decay of the higgs boson to two photons in four dimensions , where gauge invariance is crucial @xcite .",
    "we argue that the method can be successfully used in higher order calculations containing terms up to quadratic divergences in ( non - abelian ) gauge theories , as it allows for shifts in the loop momenta , which guarantees the t hooft identity @xcite .",
    "this symmetry preserving method can be used also in automatized calculations ( similar to @xcite ) as even the veltman - passarino functions @xcite can be defined with the improved cutoff .",
    "the strength of the improved momentum cutoff method is that it can be used in theories with quadratic divergencies important for example in gauge theories including gravitational interactions @xcite .",
    "the calculation in the einstein - maxwell system was presented in @xcite and quadratic contributions to the photon 2-point function were identified but after renormalization they vanished and did not change the original running of the gauge coupling .",
    "what is the relation of the new method with the standard ( textbook ) @xmath166 substitution ?",
    "we have to modify it in case of divergent integrals to respect gauge symmetry , i.e to fulfill .",
    "lorentz invariance dictates that in the lhs must be proportional to the only available tensor @xmath136 , i.e. @xmath167 can be used , where @xmath14 is a number to determine ) and calculating the divergent integrals can not be proven to be valid . ] .",
    "now both sides of equation can be calculated with simple 4-dimensional momentum cutoff .",
    "the different powers of @xmath85 can be matched on the two sides , and for @xmath65 we get the following conditions ( from gauge invariance ) for the value of @xmath14,@xmath168    we see that for finite valued integrals when the wick - rotation is legal , the condition and the rule gives the usual substitution , but for divergent cases we get back the identification partially found by @xcite and others .",
    "quadratic divergence goes with @xmath16 , logarithmic divergence goes with @xmath13 plus a finite term ( a shift ) , it is the @xmath169 in equation . for more than 2 even number of indices generalizations of should be used , for example in case of 4 indices the @xmath170 substitution works .",
    "we emphasize again that for non - divergent integrals the rules and give the same result as the usual calculation .",
    "in this appendix we list the basic divergent integrals calculated by the regularization proposed in this paper . in the following formulae",
    "@xmath56 can be any loop momentum @xmath171 independent expression depending on the feynman x parameter , external momenta , etc .",
