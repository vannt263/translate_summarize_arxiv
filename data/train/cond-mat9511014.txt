    "a magnetic bloch state is the state that satisfies @xmath15 as well as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are magnetic translation operators .",

    "the number of subbands into which a band splits depends on the magnetic flux per plaquette in an intricate way.@xcite if @xmath27 ( in units of @xmath19 ) , a bloch band will split into @xmath22 magnetic subbands . on the other hand ,",
    "if the magnetic field is very strong , it is more appropriate to treat the lattice potential as a perturbation , then a landau level will be broadened and split into @xmath28 subbands .    for a usual solid with a lattice constant @xmath29 , the magnetic field has to be as large as @xmath30 tesla in order for @xmath21 to be of order unity .",

    "the next step is to combine the semiclassical equations with boltzmann equation to study the transport properties of magnetic bloch electrons .",
    "the boltzmann equation is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a distribution function .",
    "the effect of impurities is included in the collision term @xmath87 .",
    "we use the relaxation time approximation to replace it by @xmath88 . for a random distribution of delta impurities @xmath89 ,",
    "the impurity scattering rate is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the area density of impurities .",
    "this rate is proportional to the density of states @xmath92 at fermi energy , which varies wildly with @xmath93 because the energy spectrum is discrete .",

    "@xcite therefore we have @xmath116 this formula represents the quantization of hall current for a magnetic bloch band .",
    "second , @xmath111 is the diffusion current due to disorder scatterings .",
    "it can be put in the following form @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the current relaxed by scatterings after time @xmath119 . at very low temperature",
    ", it can be simplified to @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the density of states at fermi energy .",
    "@xmath122 is the diffusion tensor , and the angular bracket @xmath123 means averaging over the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite    third , @xmath112 is the current due to density gradient .",
    "it can be put in a form similar to @xmath124 in eq .",
    "( 3.9 ) at low temperature , but with two changes : ( 1 ) the velocity @xmath106 in @xmath125 is replaced by the total velocity @xmath108 that includes the curvature term .",
    "( 2 ) the driving force @xmath126 is replaced by @xmath127 . to evaluate this current , we need to know the explicit form of @xmath128 .",
    "this in general requires numerical calculation ( see sec .",
    "we remark that , even though the derivation of eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) is based on a uniform electric field , its validity goes beyond that .",
    "it is actually a kinetic formulation , first proposed by chambers , that is also valid in the presence of a magnetic field ( for magnetic bloch bands , the magnetic field is @xmath41).@xcite      the semiclassical method is much simpler to use than full quantum mechanical approaches .",
    "this is most evident when the perturbation is changing in time .",
    "we illustrate this by considering a magnetic bloch electron in an ac electric field . to simplify the discussion",
    ", we will neglect the effect of disorder and focus on the dynamics itself .    assuming that a uniform electric field along the @xmath129 direction oscillates with a low frequency @xmath130 , we then have @xmath131 considering a square lattice with the following energy spectrum @xmath132,\\ ] ] and substituting the solution @xmath133 into the @xmath134 equation in ( 3.10 ) , we have @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the initial value of @xmath3 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that after many cycles of oscillation , there is a net drift along the @xmath129 direction with average velocity @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the zeroth order bessel function , and @xmath139 is a ratio between two energy scales.@xcite it can be seen that the original band transport velocity @xmath140 is modified by @xmath141 because of the ac field .",
    "the electron is immobile along the @xmath129 direction when @xmath14 is a zero of the bessel function .",
    "this resembles the collapse of the usual bloch band in the ac wannier - stark ladder problem.@xcite    finally , we comment that the use of semiclassical equations is based on the assumption that impurities do not alter the band structure .",
    "therefore , the electron dynamics between collisions can be nicely described by eqs .",
    "( [ main1 ] ) and ( [ main2 ] ) .",
    "this assumption is no longer valid when @xmath22 is large . in that case",
    ", disorder broadening tends to merge the subbands and wash out the fine structure .",
    "( this will be clearer after the discussion of hierarchical structure of the energy bands in sec .",
    "v. ) however , it was found that despite the energy spectrum has singular @xmath142 dependence , the density of states appears as a continuous function of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite therefore , we divide total magnetic field @xmath142 into @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath40 is related to the band structure undestroyed by disorder , and @xmath41 is a small perturbation . in this case , the semiclassical dynamics in the magnetic bloch band of @xmath40 , driven by @xmath143 and @xmath41 , will be employed in the boltzmann equation .",
    "the usual bloch electron will circulate around the fermi surface along a constant energy contour in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it is well - known that the quantization of cyclotron orbits leads to the famous de haas - van alphen effect . in this section ,",
    "we study a similar type of cyclotron motion in magnetic bloch bands .",
    "it will be seen that this investigation yields very fruitful results . in particular , it offers a very simple explanation for the complex hofstadter spectrum , which will be shown in sec .",
    "v and sec .",
    "vi .      combining the two equations in ( 3.3 )",
    ", we can eliminate @xmath98 to obtain @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a curvature correction factor .",
    "this equation determines the trajectories of magnetic bloch electrons in @xmath3-space .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath3 moves along a constant energy contour of @xmath97 ( which is slightly different from @xmath96 ) . in a classical picture , it is the drifting - center trajectory of the tighter cyclotron orbit formed from @xmath40 .",
    "however , we have to emphasize that , the existence of hyperorbits is of quantum origin and can not be explained classically . to differentiate them from the usual orbits of bloch electrons , we will call them hyperorbits. @xcite the hyperorbit in real space is derived from @xmath146 , which is the @xmath3-orbit rotated by @xmath147 and scaled by the factor @xmath148 .",
    "it is also possible to define an effective cyclotron mass according to its frequency .",
    "however , this frequency will be very sensitive to its energy if the magnetic bloch band is narrow , which is usually the case .",
    "there are several ways to verify the existence of hyperorbits .",
    "one way is through the measurement of magnetoresistance oscillation that originates from the quantization of hyperorbits .",
    "this oscillation has a much shorter period than the usual de haas - van alphen oscillation because the effective magnetic field @xmath41 is much smaller .",
    "the other way of verifying it is by using an electron focusing device to detect its real space orbit.@xcite this method has been used to map out the shape of a fermi surface by measuring the shape of cyclotron orbits.@xcite another possible approach is to observe the ultrasonic absorption spectrum of the sample .",
    "the energy of an ultrasonic wave will be absorbed when it is in resonance with the hyperorbits .",
    "similar method has been used to detect the existence of composite fermions in half - filled quantum hall systems.@xcite      in a previous paper , we have derived the quantization condition using lagrangian formulation combined with path integral method.@xcite here , it will be rederived using a slightly different approach .",
    "substituting @xmath149 into the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) , we will obtain an effective lagrangian for the quasimomentum @xmath3 , @xmath150 it can be easily shown that eq .  (",
    "4.1 ) does follow from this @xmath81 . the generalized momentum for coordinate",
    "@xmath3 is equal to @xmath151 this leads to the following effective hamiltonian @xmath152 notice that because @xmath153 does not depend on , the coordinate @xmath3 will be a constant of motion and the dynamics is trivial .",
    "a hamiltonian that gives correct dynamics will be given in appendix a. since it is not central to our derivation , we will not discuss it here .",
    "the quantization of hyperorbits is given by @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is a non - negative integer and @xmath156 will be taken to be @xmath157 .",
    "it leads to area quantization in @xmath3-space @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the berry phase for orbit @xmath160 .",
    "the orientation of @xmath160 is chosen such that the sign of the area on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( 4.5 ) equals the sign of @xmath161 .",
    "the total number of hyperorbits in a mbz is determined by requiring the area of the outer - most orbit be smaller than the area of a mbz . assume the flux before perturbation is @xmath162 , then the number of hyperorbits in a mbz is equal to @xmath163,@xcite where @xmath164 , and @xmath165 is the hall conductivity of the parent band .",
    "these hyperorbits are the lowest order approximation to the split energy subbands .",
    "they will be broadened by tunnelings between degenerate orbits .",
    "since the mbz is @xmath22-fold degenerate , the above number has to be divided by @xmath22 to get the actual number of daughter bands , @xmath166 this formula is essential in understanding the splitting pattern of the hofstadter spectrum .",
    "the hall conductivity for a subband can be calculated in the following way : in the presence of both @xmath167 and @xmath47 , the velocity of a magnetic bloch electron consists of two parts,@xcite @xmath168 the first term is the velocity of revolution , and the second term is the velocity of drifting along @xmath169 direction .",
    "the current density for a filled subband is @xmath170 the first integral is zero for a closed orbit .",
    "therefore , the hall conductivity is obtained from the drifting term , which leads to @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the electron density per unit area .",
    "this will be used in the next section to determine the hall conductivities for subbands in the hofstadter spectrum .",
    "the discussion in the preceding section presumes that we know @xmath41 . but",
    "this is not apparent if the magnetic field @xmath142 is homogeneous . in this case",
    ", we can still divide it into two parts , but where is the dividing point between @xmath40 and @xmath41 ?",
    "a natural way of dividing @xmath142 ( or @xmath173 ) is to write it as a continuous fraction , @xmath174 and truncate it according to the accuracy we need .",
    "the @xmath175-th order approximation of @xmath173 will be written as @xmath176.@xcite for example , if @xmath177 , we will have @xmath178 etc , which are truncations of @xmath179    the @xmath180 s satisfy the following recursion relation @xmath181 which relates the number of subbands at neighboring orders .",
    "there is also a relation between @xmath28 s and @xmath22 s , @xmath182 it follows that the extra magnetic flux between the @xmath175-th order and the @xmath183-th order truncation is @xmath184 since the sign of @xmath185 alternates from one order to the next , the direction of @xmath41 also alternates.@xcite    notice that for a chosen fraction @xmath176 , the size of a mbz is fixed . without perturbation from the part that is truncated away , a wave packet will move on a straight line .",
    "the trajectory is curved because of @xmath185 .",
    "higher the order approximation we use , smaller the @xmath186 gets and larger the radius of the hyperorbit becomes . in the ideal case , without any complications due to disorder , thermal broadening @xmath187 etc , we expect there will be a hierarchical structure of hyperorbits due to different orders of approximation .",

    "the latter approximation leads to negligible error if the bandwidths under consideration are very small .",
    "similar calculations have been done by wilkinson , and his results have been very successful.@xcite however , we believe that the approach proposed here is conceptually simpler , and is easier to generalize to other types of lattices .      the following calculation is based on the tight - binding model .",

    "according to the simple rules derived in previous section , the original magnetic bands are expected to split to 22 , 23 , and 22 subbands respectively . in table",
    "ii , we compare the exact spectrum with the quantized cyclotron energies",
    ". only part of the subbands from the parent band in the middle are shown .",
    "we show two numbers ( for two band edges ) in the first row when the bandwidth for @xmath263 is larger than @xmath264 .",
    "the @xmath265 s in the second row are obtained by fine - tuning the path @xmath160 in eq .",
    "( [ qz ] ) , with uncertainty on the order of @xmath264 .",
    "it can be seen that the match between @xmath265 and @xmath263 is quite satisfying .",
    "we have done calculations for subbands from other parent bands , and they also show similar accuracy .    notice that the energy levels from fractions like @xmath266 are broadened cyclotron levels in an ordinary bloch band .",
    "they do not split from a magnetic parent band . in this case @xmath220 and @xmath221 are zero , and eq .",
    "( [ qz ] ) reduces to the usual onsager quantization formula . numerical result based on this simplified formula for the cyclotron energies",
    "also agrees very well with the positions of subbands in fig .  2 .",
    "electron states in a lattice subject to a homogeneous magnetic field satisfy magnetic translation symmetry and have band - like energy spectrum similar to the usual bloch band .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the semiclassical dynamics of magnetic bloch electrons has never been an explicit subject .",
    "one reason is that the observation of band - splitting remains an experimental challenge to date ; the other reason might be due to the fact that magnetic bloch bands , unlike bloch bands , can be changed easily by varying an external magnetic field .",
    "however , our study has shown that the inquiry of magnetic bloch bands can be very rewarding in itself .",
    "major findings in this paper are summarized below :    the berry curvature of magnetic bands plays a crucial role in the dynamics .",
    "it gives electrons an extra velocity in the direction of @xmath267 , and this term directly relates to the quantization of hall conductivity .",
    "this semiclassical dynamics , combined with the boltzmann equation , is used to study electron transport in a dc or ac electric field .    in the presence of @xmath41 ,",
    "the energy dispersion @xmath97 is shifted from the usual band energy because of the non - zero magnetic moment .",
    "similar to usual bloch electrons , magnetic bloch electrons execute cyclotron motion on the constant energy surface of @xmath97 .",
    "however , the quantization condition for cyclotron orbits has to be modified from the usual onsager condition because of the berry phase . based on this modified formula , we obtain a simple rule that calculates the number of daughter bands for every parent band in the hofstadter spectrum .",
    "furthermore , a fairly heuristic explanation for the distribution of hall conductivities is given using the picture of cyclotron orbit drifting .    these quantized orbits are closely related to the energy bands in the hofstadter spectrum . we give detailed numerical calculations for @xmath220 and @xmath268 based on the tight - binding model for the case of @xmath233",
    "they are used in the calculation of cyclotron energies using the quantization condition , and the result is in very good agreement with the actual spectrum .",
    "this shows that the complex pattern of the hofstadter spectrum is nothing more than the broadened cyclotron energy spectrum in magnetic bloch bands .",
    "the authors wish to thank a.  barr , j.  bellissard , f.  claro , e.  demircan , g.  georgakis , m.  kohmoto , w.  kohn , m.  marder , g.  sundaram , and m.  wilkinson for many helpful discussions .",
    "this work is supported by the r.  a.  welch foundation .",
    "note that there is no @xmath269 dependence in ( because there is no kinetic energy term @xmath270 in @xmath271 ) . in this case , it is more pertinent to treat eq .",
    "( 4.3 ) as a constraint on the variables @xmath272 and , @xmath273 strictly speaking , this constraint can not be used before obtaining the equations of motion , therefore we use @xmath274 to distinguish it from a real identity.@xcite a general hamiltonian for a system with constraints is given by , @xmath275 where @xmath276 are arbitrary functions of @xmath3 and .",
