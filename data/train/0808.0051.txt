    "the purpose of this paper is to study the discrete analogue of the following phenomenon in classical smooth morse theory .",

    "generically , critical points are born and die in pairs .",

    "we wish to study how the critical cells move in @xmath0 as @xmath33 varies and construct bifurcation diagrams similar to that in figure 1.2 . to do this , we need to extend the discrete morse functions @xmath3 to such a function on the complex @xmath34 and develop an algorithm to pair critical cells in each slice with those in the previous one .",
    "we carry this out first in the case where the triangulation of @xmath0 is the same for each @xmath3 ( section [ alg1 ] ) and then extend this to the general case ( section [ alg2 ] ) .    in section [ apps ] , we show the results of running our algorithms on ct scans of the head , where the function in question is density .",

    "in this section we review the basics of forman s discrete morse theory @xcite .",

    "discrete morse functions exist .",

    "smooth morse theory depends heavily on the notion of critical point .",
    "the discrete theory does as well .",

    "this allows us to track births and deaths of critical cells in @xmath0 as @xmath8 increases , similar to the example presented in the introduction .",

    "when running the algorithm backwards , though , each critical vertex in time @xmath107 is connected to a unique critical vertex in time @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to the following definition .",
    "two critical vertices are _ strongly connected _ if they are connected by a path in both directions . for critical edges and higher dimensional critical cells , which might be connected to several other such cells in the previous slice , and in fact might have several paths in space - time between critical cells , we require a single path in space - time in each direction .    figure 4.2 shows the result of running our algorithm backwards on the data shown in figure 3.1 .",

    "first , the triangulation we choose is not unique .",
    "this is not a serious problem , but it does leave some ambiguity . our choice for @xmath119 for critical cells @xmath112 is based on the idea that minimizing the length of the path out of the cell should lead to the critical cells in @xmath117  closest \" to @xmath45 in @xmath0 . finally , observe that the extension to all of @xmath90 $ ] may have critical cells in @xmath94 $ ] .",

    "let @xmath184 be the critical point at the bottom of the hole for @xmath185 ; the point @xmath186 will be at the bottom of the hole for @xmath183 . in the birth - death diagram for @xmath147",
    ", there will be a smooth curve joining @xmath35 to @xmath124 , and a smooth curve joining @xmath137 to @xmath186 .",
    "but , if we consider the discrete version of this problem with @xmath187 and @xmath188 , then we will find that the critical edge corresponding to @xmath35 will be joined with the edge for @xmath186 , and the edge for @xmath137 will be joined with that for @xmath124 . with care",
    ", we can even use the same triangulation for @xmath10 and @xmath103 and use algorithm @xmath189 , obtaining the same result .",
    "in practice , however , this is unlikely .",
    "after all , discrete approximations are usually chosen to be sufficiently dense , and so with care the above situation can be avoided .",
    "birth - death diagrams produced by this algorithm can be used for tracing features through a sequence of images . in this section",
    "we describe two such applications .",
    "our purpose is not 3d reconstruction , though , since a number of reconstruction algorithms ( for example @xcite ) and even patents , e.g. @xmath190 and @xmath191 exist .",
    "the algorithm was tested on two sequences of images .",
    "the first sequence is obtained from a ct scan of the head where the algorithm is used to trace minima of the density function which correspond to cavities and tunnels .",
    "the number of local minima of the density function in one image ranges from 200 to 300 , and most of these correspond to small fluctuations in the density and to noise . in order to eliminate these , as well as local minima with higher function values which correspond to softer tissue , we use persistence .",
    "persistence is incorporated in the algorithm for generating a discrete vector field and enables cancelling pairs of critical simplices that are connected by just one gradient path and have values that differ by less than the chosen persistence level @xmath35 . by setting the persistence level to a suitable value ,",
    "pairs of critical points which correspond to a small fluctuation in the density function , as well as local minima which represent softer tissue are cancelled , while local minima with low values of the density function which correspond to the cavities are preserved .",
    "figure [ dgm ] shows the birth and death diagram of the minimal vertices in a sequence of 12 images obtained by running the algorithm with persistence set to @xmath192 ( where the values range from 0 to 255 ) .",
    "the forward connections correspond to thin lines , while the strong connections correspond to the thicker grey lines .",
    "figure [ slices ] shows the sequence of images in which the cavities connected by strong connections are traced .",
    "points which are strongly connected are labeled by the same letter .",
    "altogether 12 strong connections have been found . as can be seen , each strong connection represents a cavity , and most cavities are detected .",

    "images of the abdomen are taken with a gamma camera at fixed time intervals after a radioactive agent has been injected .",
    "the purpose is to follow the flow of the agent through the kidneys in order to evaluate their function .",
    "the algorithm was used to trace points of maximal concentration of the agent which correspond to locations within the kidneys and the bladder .",
    "in contrast to ct scans , where noise is present in the form of a relatively small error in the densities , the grey - level function on a scintigram is heavily polluted by a quantum - type noise , where the size of the error in a particular point can be relatively large .",
    "eliminating noise represents a major problem in the analysis of this type of data sets , and a standard approach in image analysis is to use a smoothing convolution filter before processing the images .",
    "persistence cancelling provides a different way of avoiding this problem .",
    "figure [ kidneys ] shows , how the algorithm traces the maxima of the grey - level function on unfiltered images .",

    "multiple peaks like those appearing at times @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 , are also of interest , though , since they give insight into the activity within the kidney .",
    "so prefiltering images seems to cause loss of useful information and using unpreprocessed images and higher persistence is a better choice from this point of view .",
    "persistence also enables analysis of images at different scales .",
    "for example , once the kidneys are located in the above experiment , setting persistence to a lower level gives information on the distribution of the agent within the kidneys , and therefore information on the functioning of parts of a kidney .",
    "finally , we note that the algorithm has also been used in a machine learning algorithm from a robotic domain where a robot observing a red and a blue ball with an on - board camera is taught the concept of occlusion from examples of image sequences @xcite ."
