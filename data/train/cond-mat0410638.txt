    "we wish to call attention to a result which , to our knowledge , has not previously been noticed : in a bcs ( bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ) superconductor  @xcite a range of pair end states may be accessed via both normal and umklapp scattering .",
    "the situation resembles a double - slit experiment in which electrons have two paths to access the screen and cancel each other periodically in the production of the analogue of young s fringes .",
    "umklapp scattering is compatible with the canonical transformation  @xcite which is the basis of the bcs theory .",
    "discussion about umklapp contributions to superconductivity started almost immediately after the bcs theory was forged  @xcite .",
    "this discussion has gathered renewed momentum after the high @xmath0 superconductors have been discovered  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore timely to discuss our new result in some detail .",
    "we show that the trial electron wave function in the standard bcs theory is not designed to accommodate states with multiple access paths .",
    "we find that , if we allow all the end states of both normal and umklapp scattering to be generated by this wave function , then we are not able to normalize it .",
    "we extend the approach of bcs , who already modified their @xmath1 trial function to accommodate single particles and excited pairs that appear at @xmath2 .",
    "we modify the bcs trial function at both @xmath1 and @xmath2 to include occupation of states by both normal and umklapp scattering .",
    "we show that the modified trial function is always normalized .",
    "we also show that the effect of umklapp scattering is to cancel the pairing effect of normal electron - phonon scattering .",
    "the cancellation is actually the physical foundation for the average phonon frequency , significantly lower than the debye frequency , introduced by bcs .",
    "we restrict our discussion exclusively to the bcs formalism , based on the principle of variation .",
    "we do not discuss for example the eliashberg formalism  @xcite which derives from a different principle .",
    "in the bcs theory the standard procedure of variation is followed .",
    "it starts with the reduced hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 measures the strength of the electron - phonon interaction in second order , @xmath5 generates pairs , @xmath6 being the particle generation operator , @xmath7 electron wave vector , @xmath8 and @xmath9 spin . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_bcs ] ) @xmath7 runs over each and every state of the first electron brillouin zone exactly once with spin @xmath8 ( we assume a single band throughout our discussion ) .",
    "simultaneously @xmath10 runs over the same range with spin @xmath9 .",
    "an alternative approach , which we do not adopt , is to let @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_bcs ] ) run over half the brillouin zone and sum the spins . either way",
    ", we may have spin @xmath8 and @xmath9 for any specific value of @xmath7 .",
    "consequently the paired particles may be in @xmath11 or @xmath12 .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_bcs ] ) the electron term is in @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which is not entirely equivalent to the standard electron hamiltonian @xmath15 the electron term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_bcs ] ) will vanish when applied to single particles , but the hamiltonian in expression  ( [ eq : h_e ] ) will not : eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_bcs ] ) is designed only for a pair ensemble .",
    "indeed even expression  ( [ eq : h_e ] ) is designed only for electrons in crystals , where we have discrete electron energy @xmath16 , which is produced automatically by the hamiltonian when an electron is detected by the particle destruction operator @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "next is introduced the trial wave function for quasi - particles . at @xmath1",
    "this function is of the following form in the bcs theory  @xcite : @xmath19 @xmath20 is the pair occupation probability and @xmath21 the pair vacuum . here",
    "we seek the equilibrium configuration of the particle ensemble under the influence of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the trial function must accommodate all the initial and end states of the paired quasi - particles , which are indicated by @xmath7 and @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_bcs ] ) , with occupancy probabilities @xmath20 to be determined for both the initial and end states in a single step of the process of variation .",
    "now in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ground ] ) the product over @xmath7 also runs over the first electron brillouin zone , i.e.  the number of orbits in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ground ] ) equals the number of bloch states .",
    "however , this does not mean that we can not add further orbits to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ground ] ) .",
    "the growth of the superconductive energy gap can be compared with the splitting of the spectral line of say the hydrogen atom , where the electron has several configurations , with different patterns of particle location probability and/or spin but the same energy .",
    "this energy degeneracy splits to reveal further structure in the presence of e.g.  an external magnetic field .",
    "similarly , a particle pair has two configurations , generated by @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , whose energy splits from the bloch energy @xmath25 in the presence of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the energy of the pair generated by expression  ( [ eq : normal ] ) shifts downwards to give the energy gap .",
    "the energy of the pair generated by expression  ( [ eq : umklapp ] ) shifts upwards . apparently , in addition to the bloch orbits , we may have two more orbits per primitive cell .",
    "( [ eq : ground ] ) does not include all the available orbits , because the paired states there suffice to accommodate the physics : the superconductive current is carried only by the paired quasi - particles with energy shifted downwards under the electron - phonon interaction .    when @xmath2 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ground ] ) no longer suffices to accommodate the physics .",
    "indeed , if we continue to employ eq .",
    "( [ eq : ground ] ) as our trial function , then we have no chance to see what happens when superconductive pairs break into single particles or are excited under the attack of thermal phonons . to cope , bcs modified eq .",
    "( [ eq : ground ] ) into the following form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 specify the states occupied by single particles , excited pairs and ground pairs respectively , @xmath30 ( could be denoted as @xmath31 ) stands for either @xmath8 or @xmath9 depending the value of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : excited ] ) @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 do not have to be different .",
    "indeed we can check through direct calculation that , when @xmath35 , the wave functions of the single particle , the excited pair and the ground pair are orthogonal to each other : the total number of states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : excited ] ) can be three times as large as that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ground ] ) .",
    "consider in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] a spherical fermi surface that does not intersect the boundary of a brillouin zone : suppose also there is a minimum separation @xmath36 between adjacent fermi surfaces .",
    "an electron in state @xmath7 may be scattered into @xmath37 to lie on the adjacent fermi surface if the phonon momentum @xmath38 exceeds @xmath36 .",
    "since it makes no physical difference if the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath39 ( parallel to @xmath7 for simplicity ) is added to an electron state , we can replace @xmath37 with @xmath40 , which lies on the original fermi surface .",
    "this state is known as the end state of umklapp scattering and , in a non - superconducting metal , can not be accessed through normal scattering ( in the reduced zone scheme ) , at least for a range of @xmath41 values .    in a superconductor one destination state",

    "for example in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] @xmath7 and @xmath42 are paired and , correspondingly , @xmath40 and @xmath43 are also paired : scattering of the particle pair is synchronized , reminiscent of the synchronized motion of rotating doors . in the umklapp process in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we have the following possible chains of events concerning state occupation : @xmath44 the first two arrows represent scattering and umklapp folding .",
    "the third arrow denotes synchronized occupation of the state @xmath45 by the particle initially in state @xmath42 .",
    "these events can be compared with say passage of an electron through a slit , or reflection of a photon by a mirror , in an interference experiment .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] that @xmath43 lies inside the phonon sphere centered at @xmath7 , where all the electron normal - scattering end states lie , and therefore we also have the following normal - scattering event : @xmath46 apparently the state @xmath43 can be accessed via two different paths .",
    "we use @xmath47 and @xmath48 to denote collections of all the ( single ) end states of normal and umklapp scattering , respectively , which form thin layers about the fermi surface , in which empty states are available to accommodate scattered particles . in fig .",
