    "proteins are linear polymers whose monomeric subunits are amino acids .",
    "twenty different species of amino acids have been used by nature for synthesizing proteins .",
    "the specific sequence of the amino acids in a given protein is directed by the corresponding sequence of codons ( triplets of nucleotide monomers ) on the corresponding template messenger rna ( mrna ) .",
    "the template - directed polymerization of a protein , called translation , is carried out by a molecular machine called ribosome @xcite that consists of two loosely connected subunits designated as large and small .",
    "transfer rna ( trna ) molecules play crucial roles in translation @xcite .",
    "when `` charged '' ( amino - acylated ) by a specific enzyme , called amino - acyl trna synthetase ( aa - trna synthetase ) @xcite , one end of each species of these `` adapter '' molecules carries a specific amino acid .",
    "the amino acid brought in by a correctly charged cognate trna is also the correct one , as directed by the corresponding template ; the other end of the same cognate trna molecule , referred to as anti - codon , matches perfectly , by complementary base pairing , with the codon on the template mrna .",
    "in contrast , increasing degree of mismatch makes the trna near - cognate or non - cognate .",
    "however , because of the intrinsic stochasticity of aminoacylation , and occasional failure of the editing mechanism of aa - trna synthetase , a mis - charged trna may be produced @xcite . therefore , even when it turns out to be a cognate trna for a given codon , such a mis - charged trna compromises the translational fidelity by contributing an amino acid which is different from that dictated by the mrna template .",
    "erroneous substitution of one amino acid by another is called _ mis - sense _ error .",
    "pre - translational _ mis - charging _ of trna is not the only possible cause of mis - sense error .",
    "erroneous selection of a correctly charged near - cognate or non - cognate trna , i.e. , a co - translational _ mis - reading _ of a codon , also contributes to mis - sense error @xcite .",
    "the more stringent is the mechanism of selection of incoming trna the lower is the mis - reading error .",
    "but , increasing the probability of rejecting near - cognate and non - cognate trnas would increase the likelihood of accepting not only correctly charged cognate trna but also that of a mis - charged cognate trna .",
    "most of the experimental works on mis - reading error have been carried out for bacteria .",
    "so far as the eukaryotes are concerned , a comprehensive analysis of translational mis - reading error in budding yeast has been reported by kramer et al.@xcite .",
    "mis - charging of trna and the failure of the editing mechanisms have been investigated separately for a long time @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the relative contribution of mis - charging error to the overall mis - sense error has not been measured quantitatively in any experiment on translational kinetics .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a mis - charging error is not always detrimental for biological function of a cell and are believed to play some regulatory roles under special conditions @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the frequencies of mis - reading error on the codon usage and trna concentration have been investigated extensively in the past @xcite .",
    "but , to our knowledge , mis - charging has not been incorporated so far in any mathematical model of kinetics of translation because under normal circumstances mis - charging error is as low as 1 in @xmath0 ( or even lower ) .",
    "but , when subjected to various types of stress , at least ten fold increase in mis - charging has been observed @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to develop a theoretical model for the stochastic kinetics of the elongation state of translation incorporating both these possibilities within a single mathematical framework .",
    "our model also distinguishes between the concentrations of four distinct types of trna molecules , namely , correctly charged cognate trna , incorrectly charged cognate trna , correctly charged near - cognate trna and correctly charged non - cognate trna .",
    "the exact analytical results and a few illustrative plots display the interplay of these two sources of error in the overall mis - sense error in translation .",
    "the exact analytical expression that we derive for the average rate of protein elongation is a generalized michaelis - menten - like equation .",
    "the model and the analytical formulae derived here will be useful in analyzing the data collected in future experiments that might be performed for investigation of the same phenomenon .",
    "sharma and chowdhury @xcite developed a 5-state stochastic kinetic model ( from now onwards referred to as sc model ) for the elongation cycle of translation ( see fig.[fig - scmodel ] ) .",
    "the arrival of a aa - trna molecule , bound to gtp and ef - tu , and its rejection because of the codon - anticodon mismatch are captured by the forward and reverse transitions @xmath1 .",
    "the second stage of quality control ( kinetic proofreading ) involves hydrolysis of gtp by ef - tu ( @xmath2 ) followed by either rejection ( @xmath3 ) or incorporation ( @xmath4 ) in the growing protein by formation of a peptide bond .",
    "the first of the two - step translocation process consists of the brownian rotation of large subunit of the ribosome with respect to the small subunit and simultaneous reversible transitions of the trnas between the so - called `` classical '' and `` hybrid '' states . the second , and final ,",
    "step of translocation , driven by hydrolysis of another molecule of gtp by ef - g completes the cycle irreversibly .",
    "more detailed stochastic models of mechano - chemical kinetics of each elongation cycle have been developed ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to capture some other aspects of translational kinetics , we describe the kinetics of elongation cycle by the simpler sc model .",
    "nevertheless , the strategy of modeling followed here can be implemented also using the more detailed descriptions as the basic models of elongation cycle .",
    "the sc model was used further to account for the stochastic alternating pause - and - translocation kinetics of a single ribosome @xcite as well as for analyzing collective spatio - temporal organization of ribosomes in a polysome @xcite .",
    "because of the extreme simplicity of the sc model model , no clear distinction could be made , in terms of different rate constants , between processes involving near - cognate and non - cognate trnas .",
    "more importantly , the sc model captured the possibility of mis - sense error arising from only mis - reading of the codons ; it was not possible to incorporate the contributions from both mis - reading and mis - charging errors explicitly .",
    "the non - trivial extension of the sc model that we present here does not suffer from any of the above mentioned limitations of the original sc model .",
    "we begin formulation of the model with the four alternative elongation cycles shown in fig.[fig-4cycles ] which correspond to the four different mutually exclusive pathways that open up with the arrival of ( a ) correctly charged cognate trna , ( b ) incorrectly charged cognate trna , ( c ) correctly charged near - cognate trna , and ( d ) correctly charged non - cognate trna .",
    "note that each of these cycles is formally identical to the only cycle that appeared in the original sc model .",
    "however , by opening up the possibility of four distinct pathways , each associated with a distinct identity of aa - trna , this model not only allows for a clear distinction between non - cognate , near - cognate and cognate trnas but also that between correctly and incorrectly charged cognate trnas .",
    "next we simplify the model by exploiting some well known facts from the existing literature @xcite .",
    "first , we note that @xmath5 is proportional to the concentration of the correspong aa - trna species ; therefore , we assume : @xmath6_{c1 } \\;\\text{(correctly charged cognate trna)}\\nonumber\\\\ \\omega_{a } ' & = & \\omega_{a\\ , c2}^{0}[\\text{trna}]_{c2 } \\;\\text{(incorrectly charged cognate trna)}\\nonumber\\\\ \\omega_{a } '' & = & \\omega_{a\\ , n}^{0}[\\text{trna}]_{n } \\;\\text{(correctly charged near - cognate trna)}\\nonumber\\\\ \\omega_{a } ' '' & = & \\omega_{a\\ , n}^{0}[\\text{trna}]_{n } \\;\\text{(correctly charged non - cognate trna)}\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq - trnaconc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the symbol [ . ] denotes the concentration of the corresponding trna species and the prefactors are measures of the intrinsic rates of the reactions for unit concentration of the trna species .",
    "thus , as stated in the introduction , concentrations of all the four types of trna molecules are incorporated explicitly .    since the well orchestrated movement of the trna through the inter - subunit space in the translocation step",
    "is not expected to depend on which species of amino acid they bring in , we do not distinguish @xmath7 from @xmath8 and @xmath9 from @xmath10 because both the pathways @xmath11 and @xmath12 involve cognate trnas ( see fig.[fig - ribomodel ] ) .",
    "similarly , assuming the rates of translocation of near - cognate and noncognate trna molecules to be comparable , but discriminating these from the corresponding cognate trnas , we assume @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see fig.[fig - ribomodel ] ) .",
    "these assumptions help in combining the four pathways shown in fig.[fig-4cycles ] within the single and simpler kinetic scheme depicted in fig.[fig - ribomodel ] thereby also reducing the number of parameters ( rate constants ) . from now onwards , unless stated otherwise , all our discussions will be based on the model kinetic scheme shown in fig.[fig - ribomodel ] .    since most often the prefactors @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in eq.([eq - trnaconc ] ) are not available , for simplicity , we ll assume that @xmath19 .",
    "however , for our graphical analysis we ll treat @xmath5 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 directly as the measures of the corresponding concentrations .",
    "thus , we define @xmath23 as the _ relative concentrations _ of the four species of charged trna .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath24 to denote the probability at time @xmath25 that the ribosome is in the `` chemical '' state @xmath26 and is decoding the @xmath27 codon . in the steady state , all the probabilities @xmath24 become independent of time .",
    "we define _ translational fidelity _ by the fraction @xmath28 where we have used the relation @xmath29 .",
    "the _ total mis - sense _ error @xmath30 is defined by the relation @xmath31 which is the sum of the total _ mis - charged mis - sense _ error ( i.e. , mis - sense error arising solely from mis - charged trnas ) is @xmath32 and the total _ mis - reading mis - sense _ error ( i.e. , mis - sense error arising only from mis - reading of codons ) is @xmath33 similarly , the fraction @xmath34 is the _ fraction of mis - sense error caused by mis - charged cognate trnas _ , while the corresponding fraction of mis - sense error caused by misreading is defined by @xmath35    obviously , the _ average velocity _ of a ribosome in the steady - state can be obtained by substituting the expressions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 into the defining relation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the length of a codon .",
    "we also note that the average velocity @xmath40 of a ribosome is same as the average rate of elongation of the protein that it polymerizes .",
    "we define the total _",
    "rejection factor _",
    "@xmath41 by the relation @xmath42 where @xmath43    the master equations governing the time evolution of the probabilities can be written as : @xmath44    the analytical results for this model that we report here are exact , i.e. , these are derived without making any mathematical approximations .",
    "the derivations of these analytical expressions do not require imposition of any conditions on the numerical values of the rate constants .",
    "however , we now list some biologically motivated constraints on the relative magnitudes of the rate constants that we ll use later in this paper only for presenting the results graphically for biologically relevant situations . based on the levels of base - pair complementarity between the codon and the anticodon of the incoming trna",
    ", we expect that under normal physiological conditions the following conditions would be satisfied : @xmath45 . motivated by similar considerations , for graphical plots",

    "continuing similar justification for the reduction in the number of model parameters , we assume @xmath47 .",
    "we begin our theoretical analysis by first solving the master equations ( [ eq - master ] ) under steady - state conditions to get the corresponding expressions for @xmath48 ; the full analytical expressions are given in appendix [ sec - ssprobs ] . then using those expressions for @xmath48 we calculate the quantities of our interest namely , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath40 .",
    "the results are listed below .",
    "@xmath54 and , hence , @xmath55 which is sum of the the two contributions @xmath56 and @xmath57 similarly , we get @xmath58 and @xmath59 in all the expressions ( [ eq - phiexp])-([eq - epmrexp ] ) @xmath60 and @xmath61 are given by @xmath62 \\left[1+(\\omega _ { \\text{r2}}/\\omega _ p)\\right ] }   \\nonumber \\\\ b & = & \\frac{\\omega _ a'}{\\left[1+(\\omega _ { \\text{r1}}'/\\omega _ { \\text{h1}}')\\right ] \\left[1+(\\omega _ { \\text{r2}}'/\\omega _ p')\\right ] } \\nonumber \\\\ c & = & \\frac{\\omega _ a''}{\\left[1+(\\omega _ { \\text{r1}}''/\\omega _ { \\text{h1}}'')\\right ] \\left[1+(\\omega _ { \\text{r2}}''/\\omega _ p)\\right ] } \\nonumber \\\\ d & = & \\frac{\\omega _ a'''}{\\left[1+(\\omega _ { \\text{r1}}'''/\\omega _ { \\text{h1}}''')\\right ] \\left[1+(\\omega _ { \\text{r2}}'''/\\omega _ p')\\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the expressions ( [ eq - phiexp])-([eq - epmrexp ] ) can be easily justified by intuitive physical arguments .",
    "let us first consider the special case where @xmath63 . in this case the expressions for @xmath60 and @xmath61 reduce to @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "consequently , @xmath66 is the probability of following the path @xmath67 , instead of the other three alternatives , namely , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , in this special case , the expression @xmath71 is expected because @xmath52 is the probability of following the path @xmath68 , instead of the two alternatives @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    in the general case ,",
    "the _ rate _ of transition @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 the quantities @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath61 have similar interpretations as rates for the transitions @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "once the system reaches the state @xmath8 it can not return to state @xmath79 without completing the full cycle .",
    "therefore , fidelity @xmath49 is the ratio @xmath80 .",
    "the expressions ( [ eq - emcexp])-([eq - epmrexp ] ) for @xmath81 and @xmath82 also follow from the same interpretations of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "ribosome is an enzyme ; interestingly , at any given instant of time its substrate - specificity depends on the codon that it is engaged in translating . in recent years",
    ", the average rate of translation has been shown to be a generalization of the rate of enzymatic reactions .",
    "recall that for the michaelis - menten ( mm ) enzymatic reaction @xmath83 \\mathop{\\rightarrow}^{k_{2 } } e + p   \\label{eq - mmreac}\\ ] ] the rate of the reaction under steady - state condition is given by the mm equation @xmath84 } \\label{eq - mmeq}\\ ] ] where the michaelis constant @xmath85 and @xmath86_{0}$ ] , with @xmath87_{0}$ ] being the initial ( total ) concentration of the enzyme . in the past the average rate of translation by a ribosome",

    "the average rate of translation has been expressed as generalized mm equation @xcite .",

    "an intuitive derivation of the expression ( [ eq - onebyv ] ) , that provides a deeper physical interpretation of this formula , is given in appendix [ sec - cleland ] .",
    "the connection between the two can be elucidated by considering a special case of our model . in the limit @xmath90_{c2 } = [ trna]_{n } = [ trna]_{n } = \\omega_{r2 } = \\omega_{br } = 0 $ ] and @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , the model reduces to @xmath94 which is , formally , identical to the mm reaction ( [ eq - mmreac ] ) . in this limit",
    "the expression ( [ eq - onebyv ] ) reduces to @xmath95_{c1}}\\ ] ] which is identical to mm equation ( [ eq - mmeq ] ) because of the correspondence @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "thus , on the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq - onebyv ] ) the sum of the last four terms is the generalized counterpart of @xmath98 while the last term is the generalized analog of @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "for plotting the graphs , we have used the parameter values as given in the table [ table1 ] :    .values for different parameters[table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab - table1 ]    the two - dimensional plots of the error fractions @xmath52 and @xmath53 against the rejection factors @xmath100 and @xmath101 are shown in figs.[fig - figdata1 ] and [ fig - figdata2 ] , respectively .",
    "both show how the error fraction @xmath53 decreases , while the fraction @xmath52 increases with increasing @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the total mis - sense error can also decrease because , under favorable conditions , the increase of @xmath50 with @xmath100 is more than compensated by the simultaneous decrease of @xmath51 , as shown in fig.[fig - figdata3 ] .",
    "in this paper we have developed a theoretical model that includes both the effects of mis - charging of trna and mis - reading of mrna during the elongation cycle of gene translation .",
    "it also allows explicit distinction between ( i ) correctly charged cognate trna , ( ii ) incorrectly charged cognate trna , ( iii ) correctly charged near - cognate trna , and ( iv ) correctly charged non - cognate trna . for each of the four species ,",
    "the master equations capture only the essential steps of the elongation cycle . from these equations",
    "we derive exact analytical formulae ( [ eq - phiexp])-([eq - epmrexp ] ) that characterize various aspects of the erroneous protein polymerization process , particularly the average speed and fidelity of polymerization .",
    "the average speed of the ribosome , i.e. , the average rate ( [ eq - onebyv ] ) of elongation of the protein , is an interesting generalization of the michaelis - menten equation that governs the average rate of a very simple enzymatic reaction",
    ". some important implications of the analytical results reported here have been emphasized by plotting the results graphically .",
    "in particular , the plots show how with increasing rates of rejection of the near - cognate and non - cognate trnas the relative contribution of the mis - charged cognate trnas to the overall mis - sense error increases .",
    "next we point out some features of the model that should be reflected in the experimental set up which may , in near future , be analyzed with the analytical formulae reported in this paper . for a natural mrna molecule , because of its sequence inhomogeneity , the identity of the cognate trna keep changing from one codon to another . on the other hand ,",
    "the rate constants in our mathematical derivation is based on the assumption that the rates are independent of the position of the ribosome , i.e. , independent of the identity of the codons .",
    "thus , the sequence heterogeneity of natural mrna molecules make those unsuitable for direct comparison with the analytical formulae reported here .",
    "nevertheless , the model can be simply extended by assigning codon - dependent rate constants ; but , in that case the results can not be derived analytically ( with closed form mathematical expressions ) although all the quantities can be evaluated numerically . since",
    "no experimental data for direct comparison is available at present , we have not carried out numerical study of the sequence - dependent model .    as an alternative to sequence inhomogeneous real mrna , a synthetic mrna with homogeneous sequence",
    "can be used to directly test the validity of our _ analytical formulae _ reported here .",
    "for example ,",
    "poly - u , along with the necessary start- , stop codons and untranslated region ( utr ) upstream from the start codon @xcite could be a good candidate for this purpose . for",
    "any study of mis - sense error , the trna species which contribute the successive amino acids of the growing protein have to be identified .",
    "fluorescence - based optical techniques @xcite seem to be ideally suited for this purpose .",
    "we hope that the relative quantitative contributions of mis - charging of trna and mis - reading of mrna will be measured experimentally in near future and the analytical formulae derived here will find use in analyzing the experimental data .",
