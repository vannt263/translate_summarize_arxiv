    "neutron stars are ideal testing grounds for studying strong gravitational effects as predicted by general relativity .",
    "the dragging of inertial frames is one such important relativistic effect in compact stars . as the surrounding spacetime of a rotating compact object",
    "is dragged due to its rotation , the nearby spacetime is basically distorted due to this effect .",
    "general relativity predicts that the curvature of spacetime is produced not only by the distribution of mass - energy but also by its motion .",
    "similarly , in electromagnetism , the fields are produced not only by charge distributions but also by currents , i.e. , as the moving charge produces the magnetic field .",
    "considering this analogy , this effect is also called the _",
    "gravitomagnetic effect_. spacetime is distorted by its mass as well as by its rotation .",
    "if a small part of the matter starts to rotate , the inertial frame must be dragged along slightly .",
    "the small rotation of the earth also drags the local inertial frame along it .",
    "lense and thirring @xcite first discovered that the rotation of a massive body could distort the spacetime , making the spin of nearby test gyroscope precess @xcite .",
    "this does not happen in newtonian gravity for which the gravitational field of a body depends only on its mass , not on its rotation .",
    "this dragging frequency depends on the angular momentum of the rotating object as well as its compactness , hence its value is large for rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "thus the strong gravitational field in the vicinity of neutron stars may provide an opportunity to observe and identify frame dragging effects . as this effect decreases as the inverse cube of the distance from the source",
    ", the frame dragging rate is expected to be largest at the vicinity of the centre of a rotating neutron star and falls off with inverse cube law of distance toward the surface and the distance away from it in weak gravity regime . +",
    "lense - thirring ( lt ) precession is generally studied in the context of the accretion disc theory where the orbital plane precession frequency is calculated for a _ test particle _ orbiting in the equatorial plane relative to the asymptotic observer . in this article",
    ", we derive the lt precession frequency of a test gyroscope ( _ spinning test particle _ ) relative to the `` fixed stars '' ( copernican system ) which was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "he derived the lt precession frequency of a test gyroscope relative to the `` fixed stars '' for a rotating spacetime in the weak - field regime .",
    "a test gyro follows the gyroscope equation and not necessarily follows a geodesic path in the presence of gravitational fields .",
    "therefore , it is more general than the lt frequency of a test particle moving in a geodesic",
    ". it may be useful to mention here that chakraborty and majumdar derived @xcite the exact lt precession rate of a test gyro in kerr spacetime without invoking the weak field approximation and showed that the exact formulation reduced to the well - known lt frequency rate in weak gravity regime , derived in @xcite . in this article , we will deal with the exact lt precession rate of a _ spinning test particle _ due to the rotation of a pulsar . we should mention that based on the proposal by schiff , the gravity probe b experiment had been designed to measure the frame - dragging effect of a test gyroscope ( relative to the copernican system or `` fixed star '' hr8703 , also known as i m pegasi ) due to the rotation of the earth @xcite to very high accuracy .",
    "the former lageos satellite provided a low precision measurement of the lt precession of the orbit .",
    "however the prospect of measurement of lt frequency of a test gyroscope due to the rapidly rotating neutron stars is attractive , as the frame - dragging precession in neutron stars is larger than the precession due to oblateness .",
    "further , as the frame dragging effect is also found to occur inside rotating neutron stars and the magnitude of this effect depends on the density profile , it is an interesting prospect to try to constrain the equation of state exploiting this effect @xcite .",
    "the matter orbits in accretion disks can provide ways to probe the spacetime properties in the vicinity of neutron stars , including frame dragging effects .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in x - ray bursts and diagnostics of x - ray spectra have been suggested as promising tools to investigate the motion of matter around neutron stars @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been predicted @xcite that frame - dragging can be generated by the electromagnetic fields . in this article",
    "they have basically calculated the _",
    "orbital plane precession frequency _ considering an _ orbiting test particle_. + using the slow - rotation approximation proposed in @xcite , the frame dragging effect inside a slowly rotating neutron star can be estimated . in this approximation , to second order in rotation frequencies , the structure of a star changes only by quadrupole terms and the equilibrium equations describing the structure reduce to a set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the frame - dragging frequency in this scheme is only a function of the radial distance from the centre of the star . the precession frequency at the centre",
    "is then given by the frequency of rotation of the neutron star , and drops off monotonically towards the surface .",
    "in a recent investigation , the exact lt frequency of a test gyro was derived in @xcite .",
    "the frame dragging rate was found to be not only a function of the rotation frequency of the star but also of the other metric components . unlike in the slow rotation limit",
    ", it was found that the precession rate depends both on the radial distance ( @xmath0 ) and the colatitude ( @xmath1 ) of the gyroscope .",
    "thus , in rapidly rotating neutron stars , the precession rates are not found to be the same in the equatorial and polar directions . + it is well known that neutron stars are endowed with strong magnetic fields .",
    "the surface magnetic field value for normal pulsars , estimated from their spin down rates , points to values around @xmath2 g. there have been reports of discovery of high magnetic field neutron stars , both in isolated systems ( xdinss , rrats ) @xcite as well as in binaries ( sxts ) @xcite .",
    "the largest magnetic fields have been observed in anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , commonly called magnetars .",
    "various observations , including direct detection of cyclotron features in the spectra @xcite confirm that these objects possess surface magnetic fields as large as @xmath3 g. however , magnetic fields in the interior of magnetars could be even larger . as it can not be directly measured ,",
    "the maximum interior magnetic field is usually estimated using the scalar virial theorem , which points towards a value of @xmath4 g. the presence of a strong magnetic field breaks of spherical symmetry of the star , resulting in a strong deformation of its shape from isotropy .",
    "the investigation of the effect of strong magnetic fields on the frame - dragging rate in magnetars is the aim of this paper .",
    "+ the scheme of the paper is as follows . in sec.[seceq ] of this paper , we define the basic equations to describe the exact frame dragging rate in rotating neutron stars in presence of an electromagnetic field .",
    "sec.[secnum ] explains the numerical scheme for solving the equations described in the previous section .",
    "the results obtained are discussed in sec.[secres ] and sec.[secnull ] is devoted to demonstrate a thought experiment to determine the magnetic field and the `` null region '' of a pulsar using lt precession .",
    "finally sec.[seccon ] closes the article with a summary and future outlook .",
    "to construct numerical models of rotating neutron stars endowed with a magnetic field within a framework of general relativity , we follow the approach of @xcite . with the assumption of a stationary , axisymmetric spacetime ,",
    "in which the matter part fulfils the circularity condition , the line element can be written as @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are functions of @xmath7 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor in the presence of a magnetic field can be written as : @xmath8 here the first term represents the matter contribution ( perfect fluid ) , where @xmath9 is the energy density , @xmath10 is the pressure and @xmath11 is the fluid four velocity .",
    "the last term gives the electromagnetic field contribution to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the contributions of magnetization and the magnetic field dependence of the equation of state ( eos ) on the structure of strongly magnetised neutron stars are negligible , hence we disregard them in the calculations . + in the same way as in  @xcite we consider here that the electromagnetic field originates from free currents , noted hereafter simply @xmath12 , which are _ a priori _ independent from the movements of inert mass ( with 4-velocity @xmath13 ) .",
    "this is a limiting assumption in our model , and one should in principle use a microscopic model to derive a distribution for the free currents , too .",
    "however , such a model would require a multi - fluid approach to model the movements of free protons and electrons , and we leave it for a future study .",
    "+ subject to the symmetries considered in our model , the definition of the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath14 determines the magnetic field configuration , either purely poloidal or purely toroidal .",
    "we choose a purely poloidal configuration .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields measured by the eulerian observer ( whose four - velocity is @xmath15 ) are then defined as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 is the levi - civita tensor associated with the metric  ( [ eq : metric ] ) .",
    "the non - zero components read ( see @xcite for detailed calculations ) : @xmath19    in presence of an electromagnetic field , the equilibrium configurations for rotating neutron stars are determined by solving the coupled maxwell - einstein equations . in the case of rigid rotation , this is equivalent to solving a first integral of the equation of fluid stationary motion @xcite : @xmath20 taking into account the lorentz force exerted by the electromagnetic field on the medium , via the electromagnetic term : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an arbitrary current function relating the components of the electric current to the electromagnetic potential @xmath23 . in the above equation , @xmath24 is the fluid log - enthalpy , @xmath25 is the gravitational potential related to the metric component @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , while @xmath28 is the lorentz factor relating the eulerian observer to the fluid comoving observer . + we recapitulate here the basic equations for the exact frame dragging rate in rotating neutron stars ( see @xcite for a detailed derivation ) using the metric eq .",

    "the results are qualitatively the same as obtained in @xcite : the frame dragging frequency has a smooth behaviour along the pole from the centre to the surface of the star but the behaviour is quite different along the equator , which is already been explained in @xcite and @xcite . along the equatorial direction",

    "@xmath61 a m@xmath47 , the results are indistinguishable from the non - magnetic case .",
    "+    panels ( a ) to ( j ) of fig .",
    "[ diffmag ] reveal that for different values of magnetic moment , depending on the angular direction , the frame dragging rate differs inside the pulsar .",
    "interestingly , the frame dragging rates along the pole ( @xmath62 ) decrease with increasing the magnetic moments and the reverse effect is seen along the equator ( @xmath63 ) , i.e. , an increase in the frame dragging rates with increasing magnetic moments .",
    "therefore , there should exist a ` crossover angle ' where the effect of the magnetic field on the frame - dragging effect will be ` null ' .",
    "magnetic field of the pulsar does not affect the gravitomagnetic effect in this region , which we can call the `` null region '' . to find the null region",
    "we show the evolution of the frame - dragging effect for various magnetic moments ( starting from @xmath64 a.m@xmath47 ) from panel ( a ) to panel ( j ) ,",
    "i.e. , from the pole to the equator for every @xmath65 interval .",
    "the solid red line represents the zero magnetic moment and black dashed line represents the highest magnetic moment considered . in panel",
    "( a ) and panel ( j ) , the deviation between these two lines is maximum which means that frame - dragging rate is affected maximally by the magnetic moment of the pulsar in these two regions .",
    "the evolution from panel ( a ) to ( e ) shows that the distance between these two lines decreases if we proceed from the pole @xmath66 to an angle @xmath67 .",
    "deviation is minimum ( @xmath68 ) around @xmath69 ( panel ( e ) ) .",
    "this shows that magnetism has no effect on frame - dragging at this particular angle .",
    "if we proceed further from panel ( f ) to panel ( j ) , we see that the deviation between those two lines ( solid red and dashed black ) again increases but in this case it is in the reverse direction .",
    "thus the maximum effect of magnetic field is along the polar direction ( reducing the frame - dragging frequency ) and in the equatorial direction ( increasing the frame - dragging frequency ) , while for intermediate angles its effect goes through a minimum , having practically no influence on the frame - dragging frequency around @xmath70 .",
    "the frame dragging rates are plotted for radial distances extending outside the pulsar ( @xmath71 ) along polar ( panel a ) , @xmath72 ( panel b ) and equatorial directions ( panel c ) in fig .",
    "( [ out ] ) , respectively .",
    "this shows that the null region also exists outside the pulsar , at angle of about @xmath73 .",
    "this is expected as the effect of the magnetic field exists not only inside but also outside ( in principle @xmath74 ) the pulsar and the frame - dragging should therefore also extend upto @xmath74 .",
    "the change in the null angle inside and outside can be understood from the fact that , as the energy density vanishes at the surface of the pulsar , the frame - dragging frequency is no longer determined by the matter solution where @xmath75 is given by eq .",
    "( [ emtensor ] ) but by the electrovacuum solution with @xmath58 in @xmath75 .",
    "the curves for frame - dragging frequencies converge asymptotically at large distances ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "however , there is an interplay between the influence of the magnetic field on both the matter and vacuum solutions , as well as on the radial distance at which there is a change from the matter to vacuum solutions .",
    "+    comparing the energy density profiles along different angles for different magnetic moments , we find that for small values of magnetic moments ( e.g. @xmath77 a.m@xmath47 ) the energy density profiles remain the same along all angular directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : enprof_mm1e31 ] ) .",
    "this is expected as for small magnetic fields the stellar surface remains spherically symmetric .",
    "however for large magnetic moments ( e.g. @xmath78 a.m@xmath47 ) , the energy density profiles vary along different angles ( see fig . [",

    "the surface of the star is also deformed to a non - spherical shape .",
    "however , we found that when the rotation frequency is zero , the lt frequency vanishes , no matter what the value of the magnetic field .",
    "this implies that there is no contribution of free precession due to the oblateness caused by the magnetic field , and that the lt effect arises purely due to the rotation of the spacetime .",
    "the lt frequency is non - zero only in presence of rotation , and its magnitude is affected by the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "however , we have also observed that the value of the rotation frequency of the pulsar has no influence on the value of the angle at which the magnetic field ceases to affect the frame dragging rate . for the interior region , the null region",
    "is found at @xmath80 while for the exterior region it is found at @xmath81 , as obtained for @xmath33 = 276.8 @xmath79 for the psr j0737 - 3039 . + here",
    ", we should emphasize that any kind of magnetic field is not directly responsible for the frame - dragging effect .",
    "this effect solely depends on the rotation of the spacetime ( there is also an exception where lt effect is not related to the rotating spacetime but some `` rotational sense '' was involved ( @xcite ) there ) .",
    "thus , if a magnetic field exists in a non - rotating spacetime , the spacetime will not be able to show the frame - dragging effect .",
    "if the spacetime starts to rotate , gravitomagnetism is induced in this spacetime and the magnetic field comes into play to show its effect on frame - dragging . in an analogy with electromagnetism , we can say that as a non - magnetic material is not affected by the magnetic field of any magnet , the non - rotating spacetime is also not affected by the magnetic field of that spacetime in the case of frame - dragging effect .",
    "it is evident form eq.([eq : metric ] ) that @xmath82 vanishes for a non - rotating spacetime ( @xmath83 ) and therefore the gravitomagnetic effect vanishes ( @xmath84 ) which is also evident from eq.([eq : omega_lt ] ) , though the magnetic field is non - zero ( see eq.([emtensor ] ) ) .",
    "the _ tussle between magnetic field and gravitomagnetic effect is only possible if they are both present in a particular spacetime_. if any one of them is absent , the tussle will also be absent .",
    "that is why it is meaningless to isolate the role of magnetic moment on lt effect from that due to rotation only , but the deviation of the lt effect due to the presence of the magnetic field can easily be deduced from the panels ( a)-(j ) of fig .",

    "we obtained qualitatively similar peculiar features for the frame dragging rates along polar and equatorial directions as previously discussed for non - magnetic calculations @xcite , with the effect of the electromagnetic field evident on the frame dragging rate inside as well as outside the star .",
    "this could be potentially interesting for magnetars for constraining the magnetic field from a measurement of the lt frequency .",
    "as an example for psr j0737 - 3039 , we found that the maximum effect of magnetic field appears along the polar direction ( decreasing the frame - dragging frequency ) and in the equatorial direction ( increasing the frame - dragging frequency ) , while for intermediate angles its effect goes through a minimum , having practically no influence on the frame - dragging frequency around @xmath70 inside and @xmath73 outside the pulsar .",
    "we showed that this can be attributed to the twofold effect of a strong magnetic field , on the lt frequency as well as on the breaking of spherical symmetry of the neutron star .",
    "we also devised a thought - experiment to determine the magnetic field of the neutron star as well as the null angle using a measurement of its lt frequency .",
    "+ measurements of geodetic and frame dragging effects by dedicated missions such as lageos and gravity probe b @xcite have permitted us to impose constraints and better understand gravito - magnetic aspects of theories of gravity .",
    "there is a need to expand the sensitivity of future gravitational tests to neutron stars to understand phenomena such as qpos and lt precession .",
    "one of us ( cc ) gladly acknowledge kamakshya p. modak and prasanta char for their valuable suggestions .",
