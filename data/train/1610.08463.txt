    "the components that change sign are precisely the ones involved in the definition of the associated @xmath174 variable , so @xmath175 amounts to flipping all @xmath54 s of the a - type .",
    "similarly , @xmath176 and @xmath177 flip the signs of all @xmath54 s that belong to b- and c- type , respectively",
    ".    since the above operations are symmetries of the quantum hamiltonian , it follows that the effective interactions between the @xmath54 variables , that are generated by quantum fluctuations , must respect the symmetries as well . as a result",
    ", terms that contain an odd number of @xmath54 s of the same type are excluded from the effective model .",
    "for example , the only bilinear terms of the type @xmath178 that are allowed are the ones where both @xmath54 and @xmath179 belong to the same type .",
    "so , to leading order , different sublattices are decoupled from each other .",

    "consider a ground state of the @xmath7 model , where each spin points along a local axis @xmath85 .",

    "the latter are analogous to the cubic magnon terms in the standard holstein - primakof spin - wave expansion .",
    "equation ( [ eq : h0v ] ) form the basis for the rspt . in the present problem ,",
    "we have pushed rspt up to fourth - order in @xmath192 and for general spin @xmath19 .",
    "the second - order terms can be obtained from the standard expression [ eq : h2 ] _",
    "^(2 ) = 0 | |0 , where @xmath193 is the ground state of @xmath194 , @xmath195 is the corresponding energy , and @xmath196 is the resolvent .",

    "^(4 ) = 0 | |0- 0 | |0   0     now , since we expand around the fully polarized state ( in the rotated axes system ) , it follows that we should always begin and end with two spin - flips , i.e. with @xmath189 .",
    "so , for the second - order terms ( and for the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h4 ] ) above ) we may replace @xmath192 by @xmath189 . since each application of @xmath189 gives an overall factor that scales linearly with @xmath19 , while @xmath197 gives a factor of @xmath198 , it follows that the second - order terms are all linear in @xmath19 .",
    "the explicit form of these terms are given in the main text .",
    "\\(i ) first come the ones that do not involve cubic terms , and involve up to one spin - flip per site .",
    "a typical term is given by : gs | s_i^+s_k^+ s_i^-s_j^+ s_i^+s_k^- s_i^-s_j^-|gswhere @xmath199 . these terms are linear in @xmath19 .",

    "a typical term is : & & gs | s_i^+s_k^+ s_i^+s_j^+ s_i^-s_k^- s_i^-s_j^-|gs keeping track of the matrix elements of raising and lowering operators , we find that these terms are proportional to @xmath200 .",

    "<S> this flux pattern is shared by all ground states with fixed @xmath60 .   </S>",
    "<S> the most striking manifestation of the three - sublattice structure of the @xmath54 s , however , shows up when we take into account quantum fluctuations , see below .    </S>",
    "<S> the above steps can be repeated for both @xmath0-li@xmath1iro@xmath2 and @xmath6-li@xmath1iro@xmath2 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3d ] . </S>",
    "<S> there are again infinite ground states characterized by ising variables @xmath54 of three types , as in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> there is however one qualitative difference in the nature of the zero - energy modes which stems from the way alternating @xmath17-@xmath11-@xmath12 bonds propagate in the lattice . in @xmath0-li@xmath1iro@xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , they form infinite strings , so all @xmath54 s are _ nonlocal _ [ see e.g. the @xmath78 string in fig .  [ fig:3d ]  ( a ) ] and the degeneracy is sub - extensive . in @xmath6-li@xmath1iro@xmath2 , the alternating @xmath17-@xmath11-@xmath12 bonds form either closed hexagons or infinite strings . hence , </S>",
    "<S> some @xmath54 s are local ( giving an extensive degeneracy ) , like @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath78 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3d ]  ( b ) , but the rest live on open strings , like @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> so , @xmath6-li@xmath1iro@xmath2 is intermediate between the 2d honeycomb and @xmath0-li@xmath1iro@xmath2 .    the above zero- and one - dimensional gauge symmetries that are responsible for the zero - energy modes </S>",
    "<S> are very common in compass - like models and act to suppress local magnetic order by virtue of a generalized elitzur s theorem .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite here , however , these symmetries exist only for classical spins , because they involve time reversal and affect only part of the system ( a hexagon or an open string ) . </S>",
    "<S> for quantum spins such operations can not be effected ( because time reversal is global ) , meaning that the classical degeneracy is lifted and local order is possible . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to the important question of order - by - disorder , which we address here by real space perturbation theory ( rspt ) .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in this approach , one introduces local axes @xmath85 along the classical spin directions , and then splits @xmath86 into a diagonal part @xmath87 , describing fluctuations in the local field @xmath88 , and a perturbation @xmath89 , which couples fluctuations on different sites .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    it turns out that the order - by - disorder physics can be captured already by the leading , short - wavelength spin - wave corrections , which can be obtained from second - order perturbation theory on isolated bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections from the three types of bonds , say ( @xmath27,@xmath45 ) , ( @xmath27,@xmath44 ) and ( @xmath27,@xmath28 ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : gs ] ) , are ( disregarding constants ) : [ eq:2order ]    c e_03=(s ^2/8 ) _ 1_6 -|| s^4/16 , + e_02=(s ^2/8 ) _ </S>",
    "<S> 2_5 -|| s ^4/16 , + e_01=(s ^2/8 ) _ </S>",
    "<S> 3_4 -|| s ^4/16 .    </S>",
    "<S> these expressions give two important insights :    \\(i ) the correction from each bond type @xmath5 does not depend on all four @xmath54 s involved in the bond , but only on the ones involved in the @xmath5-th component of the spins . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , different types of @xmath54 s do not couple to each other . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of three gauge - like global symmetries which amount to flipping the sign of all @xmath54 s of a given type .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a coupling between different type of @xmath54 s eventually arises in fourth order ( from connected , three - site or larger clusters ) , but this coupling is much smaller , see below .    within each @xmath54-sublattice </S>",
    "<S> then , we obtain an effective ising model with coupling @xmath90 , @xmath91 , or @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , when @xmath8 , these models are highly frustrated for all 2d and 3d cases . for the 2d honeycomb , each @xmath54-sublattice is described by a triangular ising antiferromagnet , the prototype of classical spin liquids .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the hyper - honeycomb , the frustration arises again from af ising ` triangles ' of @xmath54 variables , such as @xmath93 or @xmath94 or @xmath95 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3d ]  ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> such effective triangles occur at the length - ten loops of the lattice , where the corresponding open strings pass nearby each other . the same is true for the nonlocal @xmath54 s in the stripy - honeycomb , where two effective triangles such as @xmath93 and @xmath96 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3d ]  ( b ) , are formed at a hexagon ( @xmath97 ) of the complementary color . at the same time , the local variables form 1d af chains ( formed by hexagons ) , and there is also a frustrating coupling between local and nonlocal @xmath54 s . </S>",
    "<S> so , in all 2d and 3d @xmath7 models , there is strong frustration within each @xmath54-sublattice when @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) whatever the ground state within each @xmath54-sublattice is , the dependence of the total energy on @xmath60 through @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 drops out because the three sublattices have identical @xmath101 correlations and because @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the second terms of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:2order ] ) give rise to a fourth - order cubic anisotropy @xmath103 , of the form [ eq : eani ] e_/n=-(^4+^4+^4 ) , which is the leading mechanism by which the system lifts the degeneracy associated to the choice of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath103 is minimized along the cubic axes , i.e. when @xmath104 , @xmath105 or @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> when this happens , 2/3 of the @xmath54 s become idle and only the behavior of the remaining 1/3 variables has to be understood . for @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> the systems remain highly frustrated even well below the energy scale set by @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> residual corrections eventually stabilize some type of order but only at a much smaller energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> for the 2d honeycomb case , for example , tunneling processes between different classical ground states give rise to transverse corrections to the ising hamiltonian , leading to an xyz model and a peculiar state with two order parameters , one magnetic and one nematic .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    for @xmath9 , the systems order magnetically below an energy scale set by @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> the order corresponds to a fm alignment of the @xmath54 variables of one type ( the other two become idle ) . in terms of the underlying spins , </S>",
    "<S> this state has a multi - sublattice non - collinear structure , with spins pointing along the cubic axes . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d honeycomb has three spin sublattices and a finite total moment along @xmath107 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the 3d systems , on the other hand , have six spin sublattices due to the modulation of the relative signs of @xmath7 on @xmath17- and @xmath11-bonds , see fig .  [ fig:3d ] . </S>",
    "<S> so , the ordered state of the 3d systems for @xmath9 has zero total moment .    to highlight the unimportance of higher - order corrections </S>",
    "<S> we report here the fourth - order rspt corrections on the connected cluster ( [ gr:3bonds ] ) , for the most quantum case of @xmath108 ( expressions for @xmath109 are given in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections to the bilinear couplings are @xmath110 , and similarly for @xmath111 and @xmath112 by cyclic permuting @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections are very small ( at maximum they are only @xmath114 of the second - order couplings ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , the corrections to @xmath103 are @xmath115 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the 6th- and 8th - order anisotropies from the second and third terms do not alter the physics , i.e. , the energy is again minimized for @xmath116 along the cubic axes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , there is a coupling between two @xmath54-types , @xmath117 , where @xmath118 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> these terms favor also @xmath116 along the cubic axes . altogether then , the leading , second - order terms give an excellent description of the order - by - disorder physics .    </S>",
    "<S> classically , the ground state degeneracy of the @xmath7 model is immediately unstable against other terms in the hamiltonian , such as nn or next - nn kitaev coupling , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite quantum - mechanically , however , the physics of the @xmath7 model survives in a finite region of parameter space , where the order - by - disorder energy scale ( @xmath121 ) outweighs the classical energy contributions from the other terms . </S>",
    "<S> the extent of this region depends on the specific jkk system and the nature of the perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we can foresee , however , that the highly frustrated physics of the positive @xmath7 model should be more stable on the ferromagnet @xmath119 side , because @xmath119 acts to renormalize @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 by @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is important because @xmath119 is fm in all jkk materials .    </S>",
    "<S> our predictions are consistent with the xmcd data in @xmath0-li@xmath1iro@xmath2 ,  @xcite for either sign of @xmath7 . at ambient pressure </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath0-li@xmath1iro@xmath2 shows an incommensurate magnetic order which is very close to a partially polarized state .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the _ ab initio _ studies  @xcite show that @xmath125 , which is already appreciable at ambient pressure , increases by 10 - 15 @xmath126 at 2 gpa , while @xmath127 drops by a remarkable 40 - 50 @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly then , the system departs very quickly from the vicinity of the partially polarized state , toward the classical manifold of the @xmath7 model , and eventually orders either at a very small energy scale if @xmath8 , or at the scale @xmath103 if @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> either way , one expects a strong suppression of the field - induced ferromagnetic moments . according to _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> studies  @xcite and fits to experiments ,  @xcite @xmath7 is negative , which would mean that the system orders in the six - sublattice , non - coplanar state discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction can be confirmed e.g. , by local probes , such as nmr or @xmath128sr .    on a broader perspective </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that mott insulators with strong spin - orbit coupling and bond - dependent interactions host yet another exotic correlated regime , besides the well - known kitaev qsl . </S>",
    "<S> this regime is governed by a classical spin liquid instability and unconventional spin - spin correlations along closed or open strings . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the key predictions are common for all available 2d and 3d jkk materials , providing a distinct platform for further studies in this direction .    </S>",
