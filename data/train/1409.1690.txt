    "there is a close companion to the magnetic star but there may be an x - ray bright collision of their stellar winds @xcite . for @xmath31ori ,",
    "the strength of the magnetic field is low , hence its impact on the stellar wind is weak and its x - rays may thus come from embedded wind - shocks , as in non - magnetic stars : the very `` normal '' x - ray properties of this star ( no overluminosity , softness of the emission ) confirm this view .",
    "group 2 consists of the remaining 13 b stars , which follow a significantly steeper trend in mass - loss rate than those in the first group .",
    "we determined the best - fit power - laws between @xmath25 and @xmath26 using least squares for these two groups ( fig .",

    "we have also derived the relations with the bolometric luminosity @xmath28 ( fig .",

    "we examined whether alternative relations ( e.g. with wind density , traced by @xmath33 ) would yield tighter correlations , but that was not the case .",

    "finally , we examined relations including additional parameters , such as magnetic field strength or magnetospheric size , e.g. @xmath35 , but they did not result in significantly better fits",
    ". this may be due to more complex relations with secondary parameters ( see next section ) as well as the different ranges covered by the parameters in our sample : terminal velocities @xmath36 cover a 7603600 km  s@xmath37  interval ( i.e. variations by 0.7dex ) , magnetic field strengths @xmath38 cover a larger 0.220 kg interval corresponding to 2dex variations ( excluding the extremely low field of @xmath31ori ) , while bolometric luminosities @xmath39 cover a range 2.85.8 ( i.e. 3dex variations ) and mass - loss rates @xmath23 are between @xmath40 and @xmath41@xmath42yr@xmath37 ( or 5dex variations ) .",
    "it is thus quite normal for the bolometric luminosity or the mass - loss rate to be the main discriminant for the predicted x - ray luminosities , although the field strength and terminal velocity could explain some of the scatter around the relations shown in figs .",

    "the mcw shock model was first discussed in detail by @xcite on the basis of the confined magnetosphere scenario of @xcite . while most directly aimed at understanding a single star ( iqaur ) , the paper of @xcite also presented a formula to predict the x - ray luminosity of magnetic massive stars with power - law dependences on the three basic parameters magnetic field strength , wind velocity , and mass - loss rate : @xmath43 where the magnetic field @xmath44 is expressed in units of kg , the mass - loss rate @xmath23 in units of @xmath45@xmath42yr@xmath37 and the terminal velocity @xmath36 in units of 1000 km  s@xmath37 .",
    "[ bab ] compares the predictions from this formula ( listed in table [ listoftargeta ] ) with the observed x - ray luminosities in the 0.510.0kev energy band after correcting for interstellar absorption .",
    "the observed and predicted luminosities appear to be globally correlated ( confirming the hints of @xcite ) , but two remarks should be made .    .",
    ", width=302 ]    the first and main one is that the babel & montmerle formula fails to reproduce the observed trends .",
    "indeed , a steeper - than - unity slope relates the observed and predicted luminosities for low x - ray luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ bab ] ) .",
    "this is related to our finding of two relations , @xmath46 or @xmath47 , rather than one .",
    "second , the predicted values are on average 1.8dex higher than the observed ones , for both groups ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bab ] ) .",
    "this may be partly due to the definition of instrumental bandpass ( babel & montmerle were analyzing _ rosat _ data but never explicitly stated the bandpass to which their formula applies ) but also to some idealization of the physics involved ( notably a nearly perfect shock heating efficiency ) .",
    "the pioneering work of babel & montmerle has long been the sole one available , but recently a new study by @xcite re - investigated the subject , this time considering specific instrumental bandpass and including more precise physics through the use of 2d mhd simulations .",
    "they notably found that properly accounting for the post - shock cooling length steepens the relationship at low mass - loss rates through a shock retreat effect .",
    "additionally , at high @xmath23 , the reduced confinement for a given dipolar strength makes the @xmath24 vs. @xmath23 relation become shallower , and may even turn over at the highest values of the mass - loss rate .",
    "these trends are indeed seen in our data .",
    "as mhd simulations are computationally costly , and nearly impossible for @xmath48 confinement values appropriate for many observed magnetic b stars , @xcite developed a semi - analytic `` xadm '' model , which predicts the x - ray luminosities as a function of magnetic field strength , stellar radius , and wind velocity .",
    "it reproduces well the overall trends in the mhd - computed @xmath24 vs. @xmath23 but the idealized xadm analysis , which assumes 100% efficiency , display larger values than the mhd results .",
    "this reflects a reduced x - ray efficiency ( @xmath4920% ) from infall and other dynamical effects in the full 2d mhd simulations , implying that a scaling of the xadm model is necessary .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ xadm ] shows that predictions by this model , scaled by 10% and for parameters bracketing the most extreme combinations of magnetic field and wind velocity in our sample , bracket well the observed data . to explore the effects of additional model parameters , we computed the x - ray luminosities using the individual parameters of our targets ( see last column of table [ listoftargeta ] and the right panel of fig .",
    "[ xadm ] ) : a good agreement is found , with less scatter than in figs .",
    "[ mdot ] and [ bab ] .",
    "the overall observed emission levels suggest efficiencies in the range of 520% ( grey area in fig . [ xadm ] ) , with a best - fit around 10% .",
    "note that refining this value will notably require more precise determinations of the mass - loss rates since both a lower @xmath23 and a lower efficiency similarly lead to a lower x - ray emission .",
    "indeed , detailed studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) often show significantly lower mass - loss rates than theory predicts and mass - loss rates of ob stars , generally inferred from density - squared diagnostics , could be lowered by a factor of @xmath50 to take into account the effects of wind clumping @xcite : the theoretical mass - loss rates used here may thus have to be revised downward .",
    "a few discrepancies nevertheless exist between data and the predictions from @xcite , as can be noted in fig .",
    "[ xadm ] by the presence of stars with over- or under - luminosities . amongst o stars ,",
    "the most discrepant point is ngc1624 - 2 ( # 5 ) which displays an x - ray luminosity lower by about 1dex compared to the model prediction ( see also fig . [ bab ] ) . in this context",
    ", it must be recalled that the model does not take into account the absorption of the x - ray emission by the cool wind material .",
    "however , the spectra of the o stars require such additional absorption to be reproduced by @xmath51 thermal models ( see sect .",
    "4.2 ) , which is not surprising in view of their dense stellar winds .",
    "therefore , the amount of x - rays actually generated , which should be compared with the model , may be higher than the emergent x - ray emission level derived here .",
    "this effect , which may explain why the efficiency appears slightly lower for o stars than for b stars ( fig .",
    "[ xadm ] ) , particularly applies to ngc1624 - 2 ( # 5 ) as this star hosts the largest magnetic field amongst o stars , hence the largest magnetosphere , and requires the highest absorption ( @xmath52@xmath16 , see tables [ 4tfits ] and [ 2tfits ] ) .",
    "its generated x - ray emission level could easily be 1dex higher ( see petit et al .",
    ", submitted ) .",
    "the other apparently deviant point amongst o stars is hd108 ( # 7 ) , which appears brighter than expected ( fig .",
    "[ xadm ] ) . however , the detailed magnetic properties of this object are not known , and the presence of an overluminosity can thus only be truly ascertained after further monitoring .",
    "there are also five b - type stars with observed luminosities larger by at least one dex compared to the predictions ( fig .",

    "this is unlikely to be due to the contamination by low - mass companions undergoing x - ray bright flares : the observed x - ray emission is mostly soft , and no flares are detected in their lightcurve .",
    "another possible origin for this discrepancy is the uncertainty in mass - loss rate , as the x - ray luminosity is a strong function of @xmath23 . beyond remarks already made above",
    ", this particularly applies to stars near the bi - stability jump ( 22.5@xmath5330kk ) , but only one object out of 5 belong to this category . a last possibility for explaining the high luminosity of these stars is the role of rapid stellar rotation , which can contribute significant centrifugal acceleration to the pre - shock wind plasma @xcite but is not included in the models of @xcite .",
    "however , while four of these five b stars are among the rapid rotators with the most extreme magnetospheres ( darker symbols in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ xadm ] ) , it is not a general rule , as the luminosity of some other rapidly - rotating objects are well reproduced by the model ( e.g. # 26 , # 49 , or # 61 ) and one overluminous star ( i.e. # 11 ) is not rapidly rotating . in the same vein , a mismatch also exists for @xmath4sco ( # 11 ) whose high - energy behaviour differs from those of its `` clones '' ( # 13 hd63425 and # 14 hd66665 , * ? ? ?",
    "* and this work ) .",
    "further investigation of the effect of rotation , combined with multi - wavelength detailed study of the individual stars to mitigate the mass - loss rate uncertainties would thus be useful .",
    ".,width=302 ]    our fittings also characterize the spectral shape of the x - ray emission , through two parameters .",
    "the first one is a `` hardness ratio '' calculated as the ratio between the hard ( 2.10.0kev ) and soft ( 0.52.0kev ) ism absorption - corrected fluxes .",
    "this hardness ratio appears very reliable as it is notably independent of details of the fitting itself ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ compamethod ] ) .",
    "however , when the source is both faint and relatively soft , the hard x - ray flux ( hence the hardness ratio ) may be underestimated .",
    "it is a problem which is difficult to solve without better observations , but it should be noted that it does not prevent us from detecting sources mostly composed of very hot plasma .",
    "the second parameter is the average temperature , defined as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 are the normalization factors of the spectral fits , i.e. @xmath56 , listed in tables [ 4tfits ] and [ 2tfits ] .",
    "this parameter is sometimes used as diagnostic for the properties of the x - ray emission of massive stars @xcite .",
    "however , we found it to be not as reliable as the hardness ratio ( fig .",
    "[ compamethod ] ) . indeed , even for bright sources , there is a trade - off between absorption and temperature , which means that a unique spectral shape can be fitted by several solutions with very different average temperatures .",
    "this effect was reported several times in the past ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even when high - resolution spectra were used @xcite .",
    "in this work , we were regularly confronted with this problem , e.g. fits with similar hardness ratios but average temperatures of 0.2 and 1.0kev fit equally well the spectra of @xmath3orie .",
    "the main problem is that it is difficult to securely constrain independently the level of additional absorption : average temperatures should thus not be taken at face value . fortunately , the same conclusions are reached for both parameters , so that we present only hardness ratios in the following .     with symbols",
    "colour - coded according to their measured hardness ratios .",
    "no strong trend emerges , though it is interesting to note that three overluminous b stars , which are rapid rotators , display hard x - rays .",
    "however , as before , other rapidly - rotating b stars do not stand out : while the connection with rapid rotation is suggestive , it is certainly far from conclusive .",
    ", width=321 ]    our targets cover a wide ( 2dex ) range of hardness ratios ( see e.g. table [ observable ] ) . compared to large samples of generally non - magnetic stars ( fig . [ histohr ] ) , the magnetic o stars appear to have larger hardness ratios .",
    "indeed , @xmath31ori has the lowest hardness ratio of our sample , consistent with the probably non - magnetic origin of its x - rays .",
    "the situation is different for b stars : the magnetic b stars of our sample appear softer than most b stars in cccp or 2xmm .",
    "however , as noted above , the cccp and 2xmm sample mostly x - ray bright b stars , which may introduce an observational bias .    to assess the possibility of a link between the spectral shape and the emission level , fig .",
    "[ hrobs ] shows hardness ratios as a function of x - ray luminosities .",
    "the situation appears quite varied .",
    "o stars display various hardness ratios despite similar x - ray luminosities ( and even more similar @xmath13  ratios ) .",
    "most of the b stars display low ( @xmath57 ) hardness ratios despite an extended range of luminosities though there are also a few objects displaying elevated hardness ratios compared to other stars of similar luminosities . amongst them , we find three b stars with brighter than predicted x - ray emission ( # 31 , # 45 , and # 47 ) as well as two b stars for which observation and prediction agree ( # 17 and # 35 ) .",
    "we searched for correlations between hardness / temperature and the stellar or magnetic parameters but none are found . from the theoretical point of view , the mcw shock mechanism should , in principle , result in higher plasma temperatures , because of the higher velocity jump in the head - on mcw shocks compared to those in stochastic embedded wind shocks .",
    "it is true that the emission of magnetic o stars appears , on average , slightly harder than that of `` normal '' o stars , but the scatter in each group is large .",
    "in addition , the situation is opposite for magnetic b stars , whose x - ray emission is predominantly soft , even slightly softer than `` normal '' b stars .",
    "detailed models by @xcite further predict a harder x - ray emission for a higher confinement and/or a higher mass - loss rate but this theoretical prediction is not verified . also , there is no obvious link between the detected overluminosities and hardness ratios ( fig .",
    "[ hrtheo ] ) .",
    "these facts , together with the large scatter amongst o stars , suggest that the main driver for plasma temperature properties must be different than the main driver for the x - ray luminosity , which may guide future theoretical modelling .      another interesting observable",
    "to investigate is the additional , local absorption ( i.e. above interstellar absorption ) . for `` normal '' o stars ,",
    "the high - energy emission arises throughout the wind , whose cool parts may absorb x - rays .",
    "some absorption effects are indeed detected , in the shapes of the line profiles @xcite as well as in the additional absorption needed to model spectra ( with values up to @xmath58@xmath16 and an average of @xmath59@xmath16 , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "no such additional absorption is needed to model the spectra of `` normal '' b stars @xcite . however , as magnetic stars possess dense magnetospheres , significant local absorption might still be possible .",
    "except for the highest value ( found in ngc1624 - 2 , the most magnetic o star ) , the absorption values found for magnetic o stars are not significantly different from what is observed in `` normal '' o stars .",
    "it may be noted that the o stars with the three highest absorptions also display the three highest hardness ratios , pointing to absorption as responsible for elevated ratios , rather than temperature ( fig .",
    "[ hrobs ] and tables [ 4tfits ] , [ 2tfits ] ) .",
    "however , no correlation between absorption and the stellar / magnetic parameters could be found .    in a similar way",
    ", magnetic b stars do not generally require additional absorption , like their non - magnetic siblings . whenever best - fits require additional absorptions ( tables [ 4tfits ] and [ 2tfits ] ) , a fit with ( forced )",
    "zero additional absorption has a similar quality .",
    "there are however two exceptions ( # 29 and # 42 ) .",
    "it is difficult to find a common point between these two objects , apart from the fact that they have both been reported to be herbig stars - but they are not the only ones in our sample .",
    "rapid rotation , associated with large and dense magnetospheres , is not an explanation either , as the latter object is rapidly - rotating , but not the former , and other rapidly - rotating magnetic stars do not show such increased absorption .      to assess the presence of changes in the observed x - ray emission ,",
    "several exposures are needed but in our dataset , only eight targets have more than one spectrum available .",
    "we have therefore examined this subsample , by searching for variability between the individual exposures ( see table [ variabsum ] for a summary ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that this subsample represent only a small fraction of the petit et al .",
    "catalog : the derived conclusions thus do not have a general character .          the observations ( xmm__-newton _ _  only ) of @xmath31ori yield remarkably stable results . for hd148937 ,",
    "there is also no significant difference between the two xmm__-newton _",
    "_  observations , but the average temperature appears 10% higher in the _ chandra _  exposure , and the associated flux are about 15% lower .",
    "this is reminiscent of the results of @xcite for isolated galaxy clusters .",
    "the detected changes therefore seem to be related to cross - calibration differences and can not be attributed to the star without further information .",
    "a similar situation is found for @xmath3orie .",
    "the constancy of the x - ray emission of these three objects can be attributed to their magnetic and geometric properties .",
    "hd148937 has a low obliquity angle between the magnetic pole and the rotational axis , so that the variations of the line profiles in the optical domain are of very small amplitude @xcite .",
    "this geometry also reduces the possibilities of change in occultation or absorption ( see sect .",
    "4.3.3 ) , explaining the stable x - ray emission . for @xmath3orie ,",
    "the rotation period is short ( 1.19d , or 103ks ) so that changes related to confined winds would be easily detected during a long exposure like the _ chandra _  observation ( 91ks ) but that is not the case ( * ? ?",
    "* see in particular their fig .",
    "this absence of phase - locked x - ray variations in @xmath3orie explains the stability of the x - ray emission when comparing xmm__-newton _ _  and _ chandra _  datasets .",
    "it could be related to the large size of the magnetosphere ( about 31r@xmath60 for the alfven radius ) , which minimizes the impact of occultations in the high - energy domain .",
    "finally , the wind confinement of @xmath31ori is very small , so that the wind is nearly undisturbed by the presence of the ( small ) magnetic field .",
    "its x - ray emission , most probably linked to embedded wind shocks as for non - magnetic o stars , is not expected to vary ( cf .",
    "@xmath31 pup , * ? ? ?",
    "the observations of @xmath5cep display small flux variations , though the spectral shape ( hence the average temperature and hardness ratio ) appears stable .",
    "this confirms the analysis of @xcite of the same data .",
    "the available datasets were taken over 10d , an interval comparable to the rotation period ( 12d ) , but , without additional data , it is difficult to judge whether these small flux variations are truly correlated with the stellar rotation period : their origin remains uncertain .",
    "hd47777 also displays a quite stable spectral shape , but its flux varies by at least a factor of two ( fig .",
    "[ variab ] ) . a rotation period of 2.64d ( about 228ks ) was recently derived for this object @xcite .",
    "the longest available exposures cover about half of that period ( table [ listoftargetb ] ) , and we therefore examined the x - ray lightcurves to search for variations compatible with it .",
    "none was detected , but @xmath010ks flares at least tripling the x - ray emission level are observed in _",
    "chandra _  exposure # 2540 and in xmm__-newton _ _  exposure # 0011420101 .",
    "outside flaring episodes , the flux appears less variable .",
    "it must be recalled that hd47777 is a herbig star , hence the presence of flares is not totally surprising ( e.g. through the possible contamination by x - rays from a low - mass companion ) . their link with the mcws is certainly not established .",
    "the changes in hd191612 were reported by @xcite , and we confirm here the results of varying flux and spectral shape .",
    "these variations are clearly phase - locked , with the maximum ( resp .",
    "minimum ) flux occurring when the dense equatorial regions are seen face - on ( resp . edge - on ) @xcite .",
    "similar variations are seen for nu ori ( fig .",
    "[ variab ] ) .",
    "in addition , the _ chandra _  data systematically yield fittings with lower hardness ratios and lower average temperatures , which is contrary to known calibration effects @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the target truly was softer when observed with _",
    "chandra_.    tr16 - 22 was observed more than 20 times in the x - ray range and shows clear flux and spectral shape variations ( fig .",
    "[ variab ] , and @xcite ) .",
    "changes are best seen on xmm__-newton _ _  data , because of their higher quality , their higher number , and the fact that they cover a large range of flux and hardness values .",
    "the large number of exposures helped us identifying , for the first time , the possible period of tr16 - 22 @xcite .",
    "variations in both flux and spectral shape are thus detected for three stars , as well as for @xmath2oric @xcite .",
    "moreover , for hd191612 , @xmath2oric , and possibly tr16 - 22 , the flux variations are clearly phased with the stellar rotation period , as demonstrated by the simultaneous minima in x - ray and optical emissions .",
    "this can be qualitatively explained in the case of magnetic oblique rotators : as the view on the magnetosphere changes as the star rotates , occultation of the x - ray emitting regions by the star or obscuration by its confined wind can cause periodic variations , recurring with the stellar rotation period .",
    "however , the latter explanation can be discarded : a large increase in absorption would be required to explain the observed flux decreases , but no significant one ( i.e. larger than 23@xmath3 ) was detected during our spectral fitting nor for @xmath2oric , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see in particular their fig .",
    "14 ) . moreover , if absorption was the cause of the flux variations , the x - ray emission would actually always be softer when the flux is minimum , which is not the case ( see below ) .",
    "we are thus left with the hypothesis of occultation as the main cause of the x - ray variations . in this case",
    ", the observation of simultaneous flux and hardness changes indicates that the x - ray production region is somewhat stratified in temperature .",
    "however , hd191612 , tr16 - 22 , and nuori , appear harder when brighter , while @xmath2oric appears to be softer while brighter in the coup data ( see fig . 7 in",
    "* ) , i.e. the opposite behaviour despite the fact that @xmath2oric is not conceptually different from the three others .",
    "since there are two hardness / flux trends , the inferred magnetospheric geometry must differ from star to star : for @xmath2oric , the warm plasma , responsible for the soft x - rays , is the one suffering most from occultation and should thus be confined in a smaller region ; for the other stars , the hard x - rays should be produced closer to the photosphere and magnetic equator , explaining their disappearance during occultations , while the soft x - rays should be produced in a larger region , less prone to such effects .    up to now",
    ", the problem of flux or hardness changes was not addressed in published mcw models yet .",
    "the behaviours reported above therefore represents strong observational constraints , that can help guiding future modelling .",
    "the goal of this analysis is to study the x - ray emission of magnetic ob stars . with this aim ,",
    "we have analyzed a large series of x - ray observations ( more than 100 exposures ) , which cover @xmath060% of the known magnetic massive stars listed recently by @xcite .",
    "spectra were extracted and fitted by thermal models whenever the sources were bright enough ( 28 cases ) .",
    "in addition , we converted the count rates into x - ray luminosities for 5 faint sources , while upper limits on the x - ray luminosities were derived for 6 undetected objects .",
    "two o stars ( @xmath31ori and plaskett s star ) show distinct x - ray properties , indicating that the main origin of their x - ray emission is most probably non - magnetic .",
    "we analyzed the whole sample in quest of relations between x - ray properties and stellar / magnetic parameters .",
    "the x - ray luminosities follow @xmath30 ( hence @xmath21 $ ]  is constant at @xmath61 ) for o stars and a few b stars , and @xmath62 for most b stars .",
    "considering alternative relations or a two - parameter dependence of the luminosity , e.g. on mass - loss rate and magnetic field rather than on mass - loss rate only , does not improve significantly the results .",
    "it must be noted that the observed x - ray luminosities , and their trends with mass - loss rates , can not be explained within the framework of embedded wind shocks . on the other hand ,",
    "luminosity predictions using the @xcite model of mcws are too high ( by 1.8dex ) and fail to reproduce the observed trends at high and low mass - loss rates .",
    "new mhd modelling of mcws including shock retreat @xcite are however able to match observations ( level of x - ray emission , trend with mass - loss rates ) fairly well .",
    "there are nevertheless five b stars much more luminous than expected : most of them are rapid rotators , but not all ; in a similar way , not all rapid rotators are overluminous .",
    "the origin of their intense x - ray emission thus remains uncertain , requiring more observational and theoretical work .",
    "regarding other observables , the situation appears less clear .",
    "additional absorption is needed for fitting x - ray spectra from o stars and a few b stars , but no obvious correlation with stellar / magnetic properties is detected .",
    "spectral shape varies amongst the targets , but again , no obvious correlation with stellar / magnetic properties is detected , contrary to expectations of harder emission with higher confinement or mass - loss rate .",
    "further theoretical work is thus required to identify the missing ingredient explaining this ( lack of ) trends .",
    "finally , when several observations were available , we have examined the variability of the objects and observe three different behaviours .",
    "first , x - ray characteristics were found to be constant in some cases , as expected from the properties of the target ( pole - on geometry for hd148937 , large magnetosphere for @xmath3orie , non - magnetic origin of the x - rays for @xmath31ori ) .",
    "second , flux changes without changes in spectral shape are observed in two cases ( hd47777 and @xmath5cep ) but they can not be linked to the confined wind phenomenon using current data .",
    "lastly , periodic changes in flux and spectral shape are also observed ( e.g. hd191612 and @xmath2ori c ) .",
    "they are most probably linked to occultation effects in magnetic oblique rotator systems and suggest various temperature stratification for the mcw regions .",

    "<S> we show that the x - ray luminosity is strongly correlated with the stellar wind mass - loss - rate , with a power - law form that is slightly steeper than linear for the majority of the less luminous , lower-@xmath1 b stars and flattens for the more luminous , higher-@xmath1 o stars . </S>",
    "<S> as the winds are radiatively driven , these scalings can be equivalently written as relations with the bolometric luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the observed x - ray luminosities , and their trend with mass - loss rates , are well reproduced by new mhd models , although a few overluminous stars ( mostly rapidly rotating objects ) exist . </S>",
    "<S> no relation is found between other x - ray properties ( plasma temperature , absorption ) and stellar or magnetic parameters , contrary to expectations ( e.g. higher temperature for stronger mass - loss rate ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the main driver for the plasma properties is different from the main determinant of the x - ray luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , variations of the x - ray hardnesses and luminosities , in phase with the stellar rotation period , are detected for some objects and they suggest some temperature stratification to exist in massive stars magnetospheres . </S>"
