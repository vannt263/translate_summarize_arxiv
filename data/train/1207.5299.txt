    "in the physics literature , methods have been developed to model a wide range of open quantum systems , such as those encountered in quantum optics , within the framework of quantum stochastic differential equations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this context",
    ", quantum noise is used to represent the influence of large heat baths and boson fields , including optical and phonon fields , from which completely positive maps , lindblad generators and master equations are obtained by taking expectations @xcite .",
    "we may then distinguish two types of quantum stochastic differential equations , namely , linear and nonlinear .",
    "linear quantum systems can be described by linear quantum stochastic differential equations and arise mostly in the area of quantum optics ; e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an important class of linear quantum stochastic models describe the heisenberg evolution of the annihilation and creation operators of several independent open quantum harmonic oscillators that are coupled to external coherent bosonic fields , such as coherent laser beams ; e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . a special class of these linear quantum systems is driven by quantum wiener processes as in @xcite where physical realizability conditions are developed to determine when the linear quantum system under consideration can be regarded as a representation of a linear quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "this imposes some restrictions on the matrices describing the linear quantum model .",
    "this notion of physical realizability has been further investigated in @xcite where the authors prove the equivalence between the algebraic conditions for physical realizability obtained in @xcite and a frequency domain condition that an associated linear system is @xmath0-unitary .",
    "in fact , @xcite extends the frequency domain physical realizability results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite which apply to linear quantum systems described purely in terms of annihilation operators only to a more general class of linear quantum systems , which are described in terms of both the annihilation and creation operators .",
    "more explicitly , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the physical realizability conditions developed for annihilation - operator linear quantum systems have been related to the lossless property of linear systems and @xcite generalizes this result to relate the corresponding physical realizability conditions of annihilation and creation operators linear quantum systems to the property of @xmath0-unitary",
    ". however , the question of addressing the physical realizability conditions for nonlinear quantum systems described by nonlinear quantum stochastic differential equations is still open . and in this paper , we restrict attention to a class of nonlinear quantum systems which is a generalization of the annihilation operator only linear quantum systems considered in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii defines the class of nonlinear quantum systems under consideration .",
    "section iii develops conditions under which the commutation relations for the nonlinear quantum systems are preserved .",
    "section iv defines physical realizability in terms of nonlinear open quantum harmonic oscillators .",

    "the system is coupled to the field through a scattering matrix @xmath12 and a coupling vector of operators @xmath13 given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 .",
