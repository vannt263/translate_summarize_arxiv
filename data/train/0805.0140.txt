    "globular clusters ( gcs ) harbour an impressive array of exotic stellar populations , such as blue stragglers ( bss ) , millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and helium white dwarfs ( he wds ) . the sizes of these populations can be significantly enhanced in gcs , relative to the galactic field .",
    "this is a direct result of the high stellar densities encountered in gc cores ( up to at least @xmath3 ) . in such extreme environments ,",
    "dynamical interactions between cluster members occur rather frequently , which opens up new and efficient production channels for virtually all types of `` stellar exotica . ''",
    "thus gcs are excellent laboratories for studying these otherwise extremely rare objects ( maccarone & knigge 2007 ) .",
    "this argument can also be turned around . since exotic stellar populations in gcs",
    "are preferentially produced by dynamical interactions , they can be used as tracers of a gc s dynamical state .",
    "for example , the number of faint x - ray sources in gcs has been shown to correlate well with the predicted stellar encounter rate ( pooley et al .",
    "2003 ; heinke et al .",
    "2003a ; gendre , barret & webb 2003a ; pooley & hut 2006 ) , and deviations from this relationship can be related to specific dynamically - relevant factors ( e.g. the highly elliptical orbit of ngc  6397 ; see pooley et al .",
    ".    however , exotic stellar populations are not merely passive tracers of gc evolution . instead ,",
    "most of these populations are composed of close binaries that actively drive the evolution of their host clusters towards evaporation .",
    "both primordial and dynamically - formed close binaries can be thought of as heat sources in this context : in successive dynamical encounters with passing single stars , close binaries tend to give up gravitational binding energy to their interaction partners , and hence to their parent cluster as a whole .",
    "the binaries themselves become increasingly tight in the process ( i.e. they `` harden '' ) .",
    "thus stellar exotica in gcs are not merely _ formed _ dynamically , but are part of the central feedback loop that links the dynamical evolution of a gc to the formation and evolution of its close binary population ( e.g. hut et al .",
    "1992 [ section 3.1.3 ] ; shara & hurley 2006 ; hurley , aarseth & shara 2007 ) .        even though exotic stellar populations are abundant in gcs compared to the galactic field , they still represent only a small fraction of the total number of stars in any cluster .",
    "thus even in gcs , finding and characterizing these populations is a challenging task .",
    "one useful feature common to most members of these populations is that their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) tend to be `` bluer '' than those of ordinary stars ( i.e. a larger fraction of their radiation is emitted at higher frequencies ) .",
    "this can be exploited .",
    "for example , deep x - ray surveys have turned out to be a powerful method for locating xrbs and cvs in gcs ( e.g. grindlay et al . 2001ab ; pooley et al .",
    "2002 ; heinke et al .",
    "2003b ; gendre , barret & webb 2003b ; heinke et al .",
    "2005 ; webb , wheatley & barret 2006 ) .",
    "similarly , far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) surveys of gcs are sensitive to an even wider range of `` hot '' exotic populations , while still avoiding the crowding problems associated with optical searches ( e.g. ferraro et al .",
    "2001 ; knigge et al .",
    "2002 [ hereafter paper i ] ; dieball et al . 2005a ; dieball et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , the detection of x - ray emission and/or fuv excess is usually not enough to yield a unique source classification .",
    "thus additional information  ideally based on spectroscopic observations  is required for a full census of the exotic stellar populations in gcs .    here",
    ", we present fuv spectroscopy obtained with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ of 48 fuv - excess sources in the core of 47 tuc .",
    "based mainly on their position in a fuv / optical colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , these sources are expected to include bss , cvs and young wds ( paper i ) .",
    "we find examples of all of these classes in our spectroscopy , along with unexpected discoveries of even more exotic objects . in section  2",
    ", we describe the observations we use in our study , along with our data reduction and analysis methods .",
    "we also highlight the positions of our spectroscopic targets in the cmd and present proper motion - based membership information for a subset of sources . in section  3 , we present an overview of all the individual spectra and assess the overall relationship between cmd position and spectroscopic classification . the heart of this paper is section  4 , where we take a detailed look at the most interesting sources . we also construct global fuv through near - infrared ( nir ) seds for these objects and use joint fits to the spectroscopic and sed data to determine their nature . in section  5 ,",
    "we discuss some of the wider implications of our work and estimate the wd binary fraction in 47  tuc .",
    "finally , in section  6 , we summarize our main results and conclusions .",
    "we have carried out a deep spectrosopic and photometric survey of 47 tuc in the fuv waveband . in total",
    ", we obtained 30 orbits of _ hst / stis _ observations for our program ( g0 - 8279 ) , split into 6 epochs of 5 orbits each .",
    "imaging exposures were obtained at the beginning and end of each epoch , with the rest of the time being spent on slitless spectroscopy .",
    "exposure times were typically 600  s for both imaging and spectroscopy . in total",
    ", we obtained approximately 14,600  s of fuv imaging and 82,200  s of slitl < ess spectroscopy .",
    "all of the observations used the fuv - mama detectors , together with the f25qtz filter . this filter blocks geocoronal ly @xmath4 oi 1304  and oi ] 1356   emission , which would otherwise produce an unacceptably high background in our slitless spectral images .",
    "the resulting photometric bandpass is strongly asymmetric , with peak transmission at about 1487   , just above the sharp cut - off around 1450   ; the pivot wavelength is 1595   , and the full - width at half - maximum is 229   .",
    "the 1024@xmath51024 pixel fuv - mama detectors cover a field of view of about 25@xmath525  ( corresponding to about 1/3 of 47  tuc s core ) with a spatial sampling of about 24.5  mas  pix@xmath6 .",
    "the data reduction and analysis steps carried out for the direct images  which include the construction of a combined master image , as well as source detection and photometry  have already been described in paper i. we will use the resulting fuv source catalogue throughout this paper , except for three small changes and additions .",
    "first , in paper i , we restricted our attention to the spatial area common to _ all _ direct images .",
    "even though the spatial shifts between images taken in different epochs are quite small , this restriction removed one bright fuv source for which we now have a high - quality spectrum .",
    "we have therefore added this source ",
    "star 999 in the notation adopted below  to the photometric catalogue .",
    "second , we have applied a small ( 0.086  mag ) correction to the fuv magnitudes obtained in paper i in order to account for the sensititivity loss of the fuv - mama detectors at the time of the observations .",
    "this correction was not available at the time of paper i s publication .",
    "third , as described in knigge et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we have applied distortion and boresight corrections to the fuv source positions . the boresight correction is designed to put our equatorial coordinates into the absolute astrometric frame defined by the chandra source positions listed in heinke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "our slitless fuv spectroscopy was carried out with the g140l grating , which provides a dispersion of 0.584    pix@xmath6 and a spectral resolution of about 1.2   .",
    "this set - up can cover a spectral range of roughly 1450    ",
    "however , note that in slitless observations , the actual wavelength range covered for each source depends on its spatial position on the detector . since the observatory software automatically applied a spatial offset to all spectroscopic observations , the effective field of view for the spectral images was only about 85% of the field available in the direct images .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] shows the co - added direct and spectral images side - by - side .",
    "this figure illustrates the high efficiency of the slitless approach , but also the technical challenges it poses . by moving to the fuv waveband",
    ", we can drastically reduce the crowding that plagues optical images , since the vast majority of `` normal '' cluster members are simply not hot enough to produce appreciable amounts of fuv flux ( see figure  1 in paper i for a graphic illustration of this effect ) . as a result ,",
    "multi - object slitless spectroscopy of dense gc cores becomes feasible in the fuv and provides an efficient technique for determining the nature of exotic stellar populations .",
    "however , extracting single - source spectra from slitless spectral images like that shown in figure  [ fig : images ] is not a trivial task .",
    "part of the difficulty stems from the fact that the spatial and spectral dimensions are not independent .",
    "however , the more important problem is the blending of sources in the spectral image .",
    "we deal with these technical challenges by using the multispec software package , which has been specifically designed to facilitate the extraction of single - source spectra from multi - object slitless spectral images ( maz - apellniz 2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "briefly , multispec uses the position , brightness and colour of each source ( as determined from direct images of the field ) to generate an initial estimate of its spectrum .",
    "next , all of these estimates are combined to construct a complete synthetic spectral image that can be directly compared ( in a @xmath7 sense ) to the actual spectral image .",
    "the initial estimates of the individual spectra are then iteratively optimized until the best possible match between synthetic and real spectral images has been achieved .",
    "a few points are worth noting regarding this process .",
    "first , a key factor in the construction of the synthetic spectral image from the individual spectra is the wavelength - dependent cross - dispersion profile ( cdp ) .",
    "this is effectively the point spread function ( psf ) perpendicular to the dispersion direction in the spectral image .",
    "we derived the cdp for our instrumental set - up from calibration observations in the _ hst _ archive .",
    "second , blending is self - consistently accounted for in the extraction , since an arbitrary number of sources can contribute to any given pixel in the synthetic spectral image .",
    "third , the extraction process also allows for a smoothly varying global detector background , which is iteratively estimated from the residuals between real and synthetic spectral images .",
    "fourth , we extract source spectra separately for each epoch .",
    "this avoids any problems associated with the slight spatial offsets between the spectral images for each epoch .",
    "our final spectrum for each source is then the exposure - weighted average of the optimized single - epoch spectra .",
    "the extracted source spectra will be good approximations to the true source spectra , as long as ( i ) the cdp is sufficiently accurate , ( ii ) the input source catalogue is sufficiently accurate and complete , and ( iii ) blending is not too severe .",
    "all of these conditions imply that there is a limit to the ability of the algorithm in extracting spectra for faint objects that are heavily blended with one or more bright objects .",
    "in this situation , even very slight errors in the extraction of the bright source spectra can lead to large systematic errors in the extracted faint source spectra .    in order to flag areas of a spectrum that might be compromised by severe blending",
    ", we calculate a wavelength - dependent `` blend ratio '' for each extracted source .",
    "this is defined as the ratio of counts from the source itself to the counts produced by all other extracted objects , as estimated at the peak of the source cdp .",
    "we stress that this blend ratio is no panacea . in particular , since our estimate of it",
    "is necessarily based on the extracted source spectra , it can itself be affected by blending .",
    "for example , if the flux of a faint source has been overestimated due to blending , the blend ratio associated with that source will be underestimated .",
    "nevertheless , the blend ratio does provide an extremely useful , if qualitative , measure of the wavelength - dependent reliability of each source spectrum . as a rule of thumb",
    ", blending is not a serious issue whenever the blend ratio is @xmath8 , whereas spectral regions with blend ratios @xmath9   may be severely compromised .    in order to test our spectral extraction method ,",
    "we have folded the extracted spectra of several bright fuv sources with particularly good spectral coverage through the stis / fuv - mama / f25qtz photometric response curve .",
    "this was done with the synphot package within iraf / stsdas and yielded spectroscopic estimates of the fuv magnitudes for these sources .",
    "these could be directly compared to the photometric magnitudes , as shown in figure  [ fig : fluxcal ] .",
    "the agreement between spectroscopic and photometric estimates is generally quite good , except for the 3 bss in the sample .",
    "these generally have spectroscopic magnitudes that are systematically fainter than the photometric ones , by 0.2  mag  -  0.3  mag .",
    "this disagreement is actually to be expected , since we can only extract spectra out to 1800   . beyond this",
    ", the throughput drops dramatically and is not well calibrated .",
    "however , the fuv spectra of bss rise extremely steeply towards longer wavelengths ( see section  [ sec : bs_specs ] ) , and the fuv - mama / f25qz photometric bandpass does retain some slight sensitivity there .",
    "thus wavelengths beyond our spectrosopic cut - off contribute non - negligibly for the bss . for the other sources , photometric and spectroscopic",
    "estimates agree quite well .",
    "the rms scatter is only about 0.1  mag , which is acceptable , especially considering that our sample includes known variables ( such as the cvs ako  9 , v1 and v2 ; see section  [ sec : gap_specs ] below ) .",
    "there is marginal evidence for a slight offset of 0.089 mag ( in the sense of the spectroscopic estimates being brighter ) , so we apply this as a uniform correction to all of our extracted spectra .    in total ,",
    "77 fuv sources were included in the spectral extraction process and are highlighted in figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "useful spectra could be obtained for 48 of these sources , and these are listed in table  [ tab : specdat ] along with their basic properties .",
    "the fuv - optical cmd presented in paper  i served as a starting point in the classification of our spectroscopic targets ( see section  [ sec : overview ] ) .",
    "the optical photometry for this cmd was based on a deep , co - added wfpc2/pc / f336w ( roughly u - band ) image of the cluster core and has already been described in paper  i.    for the subset of fuv sources discussed in section  [ sec : sed ] , we additionally constructed broad - band , fuv through nir seds .",
    "with the exception of the fuv data point ( which comes from our own stis / f25qtz direct image ) , all of this photometry was obtained from acs / hrc observations of 47 tuc in the _ hst _ archive .",
    "these observations spanned the full complement of acs / hrc broad - band filters , including f250w ( @xmath10  2716   ) , f330w ( @xmath113363   ) , f435w ( @xmath10  4311   ) , f475w ( @xmath12  4776   ) , f555w ( @xmath10  5256   ) , f606w ( @xmath13  5888   ) , f625w ( @xmath10  6296   ) , f775w ( @xmath12  7665   ) , f814w ( @xmath10  8115   ) , and f850lp ( @xmath12  9145   ) ; here , @xmath14  is the pivot wavelength of each filter . due to the limited field of view and depth of the exposures we used ,",
    "only a subset of these filters are usually available for each target .",
    "all of our acs / hrc photometry was carried out with andrew dolphin s psf - fitting package dolphot , which is a modified version of the wfpc2-optimized hstphot package ( dolphin 2000 ) .",
    "the advantage of dolphot for our purposes is that it provides an acs - optimized mode , in which detector- and filter - specific simulated tiny tim psfs are used as baseline psf models . in acs mode",
    ", dolphot applies cte corrections automatically and provides fully calibrated photometric measurements .    throughout this paper ,",
    "all magnitudes are given on the stmag system , where @xmath15 for photometric measurements , @xmath16  is the ( constant ) flux of a flat - spectrum source that would produce the observed count rate in the photometric band - pass . in section  4",
    ", we will also adopt the stmag system for spectroscopic data , by using equation  [ eq : stmag ]  as a monochromatic definition of @xmath17 .",
    "this convention allows us to put spectroscopic and photometric measurements onto a common , easily interpretable scale .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmd ] shows the fuv - optical cmd for sources in our imaging field of view .",
    "the data and models shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] are exactly the same as in paper  i , except for ( i ) the slight updates to the fuv photometry described in section  [ sec : fuvdata ] , ( ii ) the fact that we now also show objects without optical counterparts , for which we adopt an f336w magnitude of 23.5 ( well below the actual optical detection limit ) , and ( iii ) we have added an approximate he wd model sequence ( calculated by shifting the standard wd sequence to account for the radius difference between a 0.5  @xmath18  wd and 0.25  @xmath18  one ) .    objects for which we have been able to extract useful spectra are circled in figure  [ fig : cmd ] and labelled with their spectroscopic i d number ( c.f . figure  [ fig : images ] and table  [ tab : specdat ] ) .",
    "each spectroscopic target is also assigned a preliminary photometric classification , based on its position in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "possible classifications include white dwarf ( wd ) , `` gap object '' ( sources between the wd and main sequences ) , blue stragglers ( bs ) , fuv source with no optical counterpart ( noopt ) , main - sequence turn - off star ( ms - to ) and red giant / horizontal branch star ( rgb ) .",
    "are relatively blue and fuv bright . ]",
    "selection boxes for all of these objects ( except the noopts ) are shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , and the spectroscopic targets inside each box are marked with a distinct colour .",
    "the photometric classifications are also given in table  [ tab : specdat ] .",
    "in the context of stellar exotica , the gap region is of particular interest .",
    "this is the area in which cvs and detached wd - ms binaries may be expected to be found ( paper  i ; townsley & bildsten 2002 ) .",
    "some such objects may also fall into the wd and noopt selection boxes , e.g. if the hot wd still dominates the binary sed in both fuv and f336w .",
    "however , as shown statistically in paper  i , both of the latter boxes are likely to contain primarily wds .    in total",
    ", we have been able to extract useful spectra for 48 objects , including 8 gap sources , 8 bss , 9 wds and 23 noopts .",
    "all ms - to and rgb objects were too faint to be included in our spectral extraction .",
    "the long - dashed diagonal line corresponds to @xmath19 and marks the approximate spectroscopic extraction limit .",
    "note that not all sources above this limit are circled in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "this is because some bright sources fell outside our spectroscopic field of view and others were too severely blended with even brighter objects to yield useful spectra .",
    "the short - dashed diagonal line corresponds to @xmath20 and marks the approximate spectroscopic completeness limit , as discussed further in section  [ sec : binfraction ] . using the same method as in paper  i",
    ", we estimate that @xmath21  objects in the cmd brighter than @xmath19 , and @xmath22 objects brighter than @xmath23 may be the result of a chance coincidence ( i.e. a superposition of two unrelated stars ) .",
    "these estimates are based on the number of fuv sources brighter than the adopted cut - offs , the number of optical sources , and the number of actual matches between these source lists .",
    "mclaughlin et al . ( 2006 ) have recently created a large photometric and proper motion catalogue that contains over 14,000 stars near the central regions of 47  tuc .",
    "a subset of 18 of our spectroscopic targets have counterparts in their master catalogue , and 6 of these have well - determined proper motions . in figure",
    "[ fig : proper ] we show the location of these stars in the proper motion diagram , relative to other cluster members in the mclaughlin catalogue .",
    "all of our targets ( which include 5 bss and 1 gap object according to the cmd - based classification ) are fully consistent with being cluster members .",
    "in this section , we present an overview of all the useful spectra we could extract from our slitless fuv spectral images .",
    "we have grouped the spectra by their cmd - based classifications for this purpose .",
    "the fuv spectra of our 8 gap sources are shown in figure  [ fig : gap_specs ] .",
    "the diversity of these spectra is striking and immediately suggests that these objects do not form a homogenous group .",
    "all gap sources will be analyzed individually in section  [ sec : sed ] , so we only present a brief overview here .",
    "clear emission lines are seen in stars  1 , 3 , and 20 , all of which were previously known or suspected cvs ( also known as ako  9 , v1 , and v2 , respectively [ see table  [ tab : specdat ] ] ) .",
    "the presence of emission lines confirms the cvs nature of these objects .",
    "our data on ako  9 has already been analyzed in detail elsewhere ( knigge et al . 2003 ) , but the spectroscopic confirmation of v1 and v2 as cvs is reported here for the first time in the refereed literature . only one other gap source ",
    "star  17  shows tentative evidence of line emission .",
    "unfortunately , the position of this object on the detector is such that only a short segment of its spectrum is available , with the red cut - off occuring just beyond the c  iv line .",
    "the line itself thus falls close to the edge of the detector , which is why we do not consider the apparent flux excess near 1550    to be a definite detection of line emission .",
    "we will discuss star  17 in more detail in section  [ sec : star17 ] .    of the 4 remaining objects , 3 exhibit flat or blue continua , but the fourth ",
    "star  10  presents a rather strange , red continuum with absorption lines .",
    "all 4 of these objects turn out to be interesting ( see section  [ sec : sed ] ) , but star  10 , in particular , is probably the most exotic and unusual object our fuv survey has uncovered .",
    "this object is analyzed more closely in section  [ sec : star10 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : bs_specs ] shows the fuv spectra of our 8 bss in the core of 47  tuc .",
    "only the two brightest of these  stars  2 and 999  will be analyzed in more detail in section  [ sec : sed ] .    unlike the gap sources , all but one of the bss display rather similar fuv spectra .",
    "more specifically , 7 of the 8 bss show extremely red fuv continua , with fluxes increasing by typically 2 orders of magnitude between roughly 1500    and 1800   .",
    "this near - exponential rise is expected , since bss are stars of spectral type a - f for which the fuv waveband falls on the wien tail of their seds . in principle",
    ", this should make the fuv flux and spectral shape a very sensitive thermometer for bss , a possibility we will explore in section  [ sec : star999 ] . in those sources with sufficient s / n , the spectra also exhibit absorption lines due to c  i and al  ii ( with a possible contribution from fe  ii ) .",
    "the obvious outlier among the bss is star  2 , whose fuv continuum rises much more slowly towards longer wavelengths .",
    "moreover , the flux level at the blue end of the spectrum ( around 1500   ) is much higher than for any other bs in our sample .",
    "thus even though the red part of star  2 s fuv spectrum may be affected by blending , the discrepancy between this object and the other bss appears to be real .",
    "star  2 is analyzed more carefully in section  [ sec : star2 ] .",
    "the fuv spectra of the 9 hot wds in our sample are shown in figure  [ fig : wd_specs ] .",
    "only the two brightest of these  stars  5 and 7  will be analyzed in more detail in section  [ sec : sed ] .",
    "the wds present a relatively homogenous set of fuv spectra . which can be characterized as blue , featureless continua .",
    "this is as expected for young wds near the top of the cooling sequence .",
    "there is little evidence for absorption or emission lines in any of these spectra .",
    "the only features that are perhaps worth remarking on are a hint of an absorption dip near c  iv in the spectrum of star  5 , and a hint of emission near the same line in the spectrum of star  29 . however , we regard neither of these features as convincing .",
    "we thus conclude that the top of the wd cooling sequence in 47  tuc does not hide a large population of wd - dominated cvs ( see also section  [ sec : no_specs ] ) .",
    "surprises are still possible though , as illustrated by the analysis of star  7 in section  [ sec : star7 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : no_specs ] shows the spectra of our 23 fuv sources without optical counterparts .",
    "this group of objects is also expected to be dominated by hot wds .",
    "as shown in paper  i , the number of these objects is consistent with expectations for the wd population , and our optical ( wfpc2/pc / f336w ) photometry is certainly not complete for these optically faint objects .",
    "since we do not have optical counterparts , none of these sources are included in section  [ sec : sed ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : no_specs ] shows that the spectra of essentially all of these fuv sources are consistent with expectations for single da wds . in particular , the resemblance of the spectra to those of the photometrically - classified wds ( figure  [ fig : wd_specs ] ) is obvious .",
    "the spectrum of star  33 contains an obvious hump , but this is caused by blending with a fainter fuv source .",
    "that source was not included in the spectral extraction , which explains why the blend ratio for star  33 does not show this feature .",
    "none of the objects in figure  [ fig : no_specs ] show convincing evidence for emission or absorption lines .",
    "this confirms the conclusion of section  [ sec : wd_specs ] that the top of the cooling sequence does not harbour numerous cvs .",
    "we will now present a more detailed analysis of the most interesting and representative sources in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "this includes all of the gap sources , as well as the two brightest objects from the cmd - based wd and bs groups .",
    "all sources analysed in this section are listed in bold at the top of table  [ tab : specdat ] .",
    "the last column in the table presents our final classification for each source .    throughout this section",
    ", we will use model fits to the combined spectral and sed data sets to shed light on the physical nature of our sources .",

    "all stars , except wds , are described by interpolating on the latest , @xmath4-enhanced kurucz atlas9 model atmosphere grids .",
    "these grids use the updated opacity distribution functions described by castelli & kurucz ( 2001 ) and account for enhanced @xmath4-element abundances at a level of @xmath27 = 0.4 $ ] . for the purpose of modelling wds",
    ", we rely on the grid of synthetic wd spectra described in gnsicke , beuermann & de martino ( 1995 ) , which has been kindly provided by boris gnsicke .",
    "we generally adopt @xmath28  and @xmath29  ( corresponding to @xmath30 ) to describe wds in 47  tuc .",
    "this is appropriate for recently formed wds near the top of the cooling sequence ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ; wood 1995 ) .",
    "we also use the wd models to qualitatively describe other hot spectral components , such as accretion disks in cvs .",
    "we will only be interested in rough estimates of the characteristic temperatures and sizes of such generic hot components , and the use of wd models should be adequate for this purpose .",
    "the spectral resolution of the kurucz models is relatively low , with a typical wavelength step of 10    in the fuv region .",
    "this turns out to be quite adequate for our qualitative modelling , and so the observed spectra ( and also the wd models ) are interpolated onto the wavelength grid of the kurucz spectra during our fitting procedure .",
    "we have also carried out synthetic photometry on all models in the kurucz and wd grids .",
    "this was done using synspec in iraf / stsdas , which includes throughput files for all _ hst _ detector / filter combinations .",
    "most of our modelling is done in a least squares sense , with every data point being given equal weight .",
    "since we only consider the coarse kurucz wavelength grid when modelling the fuv spectrum , this usually provides a reasonable compromise between the emphasis placed on the spectrum relative to the broad - band sed . in a few cases ,",
    "the relative weights assigned to the spectroscopy and photometry were adjusted slightly to improve the overall quality of the fits .",
    "we note from the outset that our goal here is to find physically plausible descriptions of the data , rather than arbitrary sets of best - fit parameters .",
    "thus we will sometimes constrain certain parameters or parameter combinations to have values consistent with , for example , the expected location of the wd or main sequences .",
    "of course , we will only do this when adequate fits can actually be found with the constrained parameters .",
    "we feel this approach is appropriate , since the match between data and models is limited by systematic effects ( e.g. blending in the spectra , crowding in the photometry , and uncertainties affecting the theoretical models ) rather than by purely statistical errors on the data .",
    "star  1 is the brightest fuv source in 47  tuc and is identical to the previously known blue object ako  9 .",
    "a detailed analysis of our fuv spectroscopy and photometry for this source has already been presented in knigge et al .",

    "this description also turns out to provide a good fit to the more extensive broad - band sed we have assembled here . in constructing this model , we have assumed that the secondary is a turn - off mass object and have used the orbital period - mean density relation for roche - lobe filling stars , @xmath32 as an additional constraint on the donor parameters ( e.g. warner 1995 ) .",
    "the hot component that dominates the fuv light is too bright to be a pure wd and is instead likely to arise in an accretion disk . in our fit , we have described this component with a @xmath33  wd model atmosphere .",
    "the temperature was fixed at @xmath34  k , which yields an effective radius of @xmath35 ( for a pure wd , we would expect @xmath36 ) .",

    "we show these 4 data points as open triangles in figure  [ fig : star1 ] . note , in particular , the almost 2  mag brightness difference between the roughly u - band data used in paper  i ( open circle in figure  [ fig : star1 ] ) and that obtained in july 2002 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : star1phot ] , this difference is easily noticeable in the images themselves .    we conclude that we have discovered a dwarf nova eruption of ako  9 .",
    "two previous outburst of this object have been observed with _ hst _",
    ", one in july 1986 , the other in october 1992 ( minniti et al . 1997 ; see also knigge al .",
    "al . 2003 ) .",
    "the present discovery of an eruption in july 2002 confirms that the mean interoutburst recurrence time is at most 6 - 7 years .",
    "however , given the relatively sparse time coverage of the photometry investigated to date , a shorter recurrence time remains possible .    even though all of the existing observational evidence is consistent with ako  9 being a dwarf nova - type cv , the source warrants additional investigation .",
    "in particular , a radial velocity study would be invaluable for establishing the system parameters .",
    "as an incentive for such a study , we note that the x - ray , fuv and optical properties established so far do not completely preclude the possibility that the primary could be a black hole , rather than a wd .",
    "star  2 lies on the bs sequence in the fuv - optical cmd ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) , but its fuv spectrum rises much more slowly towards longer wavelengths than that of any other bs in our data ( figure  [ fig : bs_specs ] ) .",
    "even though our spectrum for this object is rather short , and may be affected by blending longwards of about 1550   , we have no reason to doubt the reality of the fuv excess it implies ( relative to other bss ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : star2 ] shows the fuv spectrum and broad - band sed for this object , along with our best - bet model .",
    "all of the photometry is well described by a single component with parameters appropriate for a bs in 47 tuc . however",
    ", no single component model is able to also match the fuv spectrosopy . ) .",
    "however , our conclusion that the observed fuv spectrum shows a strong excess at the shortest wavelengths is insensitive to these caveats . ]",
    "the simplest and most plausible way to account for the observed fuv excess is to invoke a wd companion to the bs .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : star2 ] , a wd with @xmath37  k provides a reasonable match to the fuv spectrum without significantly affecting the broad - band sed . thus a bs - wd binary system provides a good match to the entire spectroscopic and potometric data set .",
    "is it possible that we are being fooled by a chance superposition ?",
    "there are two questions to consider in this context .",
    "first , could the fuv flux we have identified with the short - wavelength spectrum of star  2 actually be associated with a different fuv source ?",
    "inspection of the direct image ( figure  [ fig : images ] ) shows that there are two fuv - bright sources ",
    "stars  17 and 30  that lie close enough to star  2 in the spatial direction to warrant consideration",
    ". however , star  17 lies to the right of star  2 in the direct image and so can not be responsible for any short - wavelength flux in the spectrum of star  2 .",
    "star  30 , on the other hand , has photometric and spectroscopic properties consistent with a single wd and lies about 585 pixels ( corresponding to about 340   ) to the left of star  2 .",
    "if the short - wavelength flux attributed to star  2 were really due to star  30 , essentially of the observed counts would have to be associated with wavelengths well beyond 1800   .",
    "however , the fuv bandpass has very little sensitivity at such long wavelengths , and the spectroscopic countrates of even the reddest fuv - bright sources in our sample  the bss  peak well shortward of 1800   .",
    "thus star  30 is almost certainly not the source of any flux assigned to star  2 .",
    "the second question is whether the fuv source we see in the direct image could be a chance blend of the bright bs with a comparably bright wd .",
    "it is worth noting here that the bs is _ expected _ to be detected in the fuv , so it is not plausible that the wd should completely dominate the fuv output .",
    "we have inspected the direct fuv image in the vicinity of star  2 and find no evidence to support the idea that the fuv source is a blend .",
    "however , it should be acknowledged that the fuv imaging psf is rather complex and asymmetric , and that there are not many fuv - bright objects against which star  2 could be meaningfully compared . by the same token",
    ", however , the probability of two such bright objects lying close to each other by chance is very small .",
    "figure  [ fig : star2 ] shows that both the wd and the bs would be brighter than @xmath38 on their own . in total , there are only 20 objects ( including star  2 ) that are this bright in our fuv photometry .",
    "the probability that two such objects should lie close enough to each other to form an unrecognizable blend ( say within 3  pixels ) is only @xmath39% .",
    "thus it is highly likely that the hot wd is physically associated with the bs .    even though star  2 is the first bs - wd binary that has been identified in any gc to date , the existence of such objects",
    "should probably be expected .",
    "one straightforward way to form such a system is directly from a ms - ms binary .",
    "as the more massive object in this progenitor system ascends the giant branch , it may overflow its roche lobe and thus turn its companion into a bs via case  b or case  c mass transfer    in either case , the outcome would be a bs - wd binary .",
    "this formation channel will be available in gc cores as long as the original binary is hard ( since otherwise it would not survive until the onset of mass transfer ) .",
    "the hard / soft boundary in gcs corresponds to binary separations on the order of a few au ( e.g. davies 1997 ) , so there is certainly room for bs - wd progenitor systems in the parameter space of hard binaries .",
    "an alternative way to form bs - wd binaries is directly via dynamical encounters .",
    "in particular , since single bss are the most massive stars found in gcs , any 3-body interaction involving such a bs would tend to leave it with a companion ( usually the more massive member of the original binary ) .",
    "thus a system like star  2 could have been formed , for example , in an exchange encounter involving a bs and a wd - ms binary .",
    "star  3 = v1 is a previously suspected cv ( paresce , de marchi & ferraro 1992 ; grindlay et al .",

    "2001 ; knigge et al .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig : star3 ] , such a donor would be a relatively minor contributor to the flux at all fuv - nir wavelengths .",
    "this is self - consistent , since a faint donor like this would not produce a significant ellipsoidal signal .",
    "we therefore favour the 3.5  hr period and suggest that the donor lies on or near the lower ms of the cluster .",

    "very similar models have been found to match the accretion disk - dominated seds of nova - like cvs in the galactic field ( e.g. knigge et al .",

    "these undulations and residuals are probably due to variability .",
    "even though nova - like cvs do not show the eruptions associated with dwarf novae , they do produce a wide range of variability , including flickering , orbital and even sizeable long - term variations ( e.g. honeycutt , robertson & turner 1998 ; honeycutt & kafka 2004 ; knigge et al .",

    "as discussed in paper  i , the outskirts of the smc are located directly behind 47  tuc , and roughly one smc interloper may be expected to contaminate our fuv / optical cmd .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmd ] shows that star  27 is a good candidate , since it lies close to the expected location of the smc main sequence .",
    "note that this object is not included in figure  [ fig : proper ] , since there is no proper motion information for it in mclaughlin et al .",
    "thus a location in the smc can not be excluded for star  27 .    in order to test this idea , we changed the distance adopted in our fits to 60  kpc ( the average metallicity in the smc is similar to that of 47  tuc ) .",
    "we then find that a single - component model with @xmath61  k , @xmath62 and @xmath63 provides a good description of all of the datal .",
    "these parameters are entirely reasonable for a slightly evolved @xmath64  star in the smc .",
    "we therefore conclude that star  27 is an smc interloper and unrelated to 47  tuc .",
    "star  999 is the optically brightest bs in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "its fuv spectrum and broad - band sed are shown in figure  [ fig : star999 ] , and imply @xmath65  k and @xmath66  for this object .",
    "these are reasonable parameters for a bs in 47  tuc . however , in order to obtain an acceptable single component fit to all of the data , a surprisingly low surface gravity is also required ( @xmath67 ; red line in figure  [ fig : star999 ] .",
    "taken at face value , this combination of radius and surface gravity would point to an extremely low mass of @xmath68  for star  999 .",
    "this does not seem reasonable for a bs",
    ".    there could be physical explanations for such an abnormally low surface gravity , such as fast rotation ( porter & townsend 2005 ; knigge et al .",
    "2006 ) or the presence of a disk around the star ( de marco et al .",
    "however , before resorting to such explanations , it is worth checking that the spectral models we are using can actually be trusted in the regime we are using them here .",
    "the obvious worry here is the reliability of the models in fuv region , since this waveband is on exponential wien tail of the bs sed where even relatively slight inaccuracies in the model may result in large flux changes .",
    "the work by castelli & cacciari ( 2001 ) suggests that this worry is well founded .",
    "they carried out an extensive fuv analysis of pop  ii a - stars , based on the same set of kurucz models that we employ here .",
    "their main finding was that , for @xmath69  k , model fits to the fuv spectra produce biased surface gravity estimates that are systematically lower than those implied by optical data . for hotter stars , there was no systematic discrepancy between the two sets of estimates .    as a test",
    ", we therefore repeated the one - component fit , but excluded the fuv spectrum and photometry .",
    "the result of this exercise confirmed our suspicions : the best model fit to the nuv - nir sed ( the blue line in figure  [ fig : star999 ] ) has a similar temperature and radius to the global best fit , but a much higher surface gravity ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the bs mass implied by this fit is therefore also much higher ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "two points regarding the fits carried out in previous sections are worth making at this stage .",
    "first , the effective temperature of star  10 is just about high enough for our model fit to yield a meaningful surface gravity estimate .",
    "second , the fuv excess seen in the bs star  2 ( and attributed to a wd companion ) can not be attributed to a similar model failure .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the fuv properties of stars  2 and 999 directly .",
    "the broad - band fuv magnitude of both stars is dominated by a bs with @xmath72  k , with star  2 being only 0.2  mag brighter than star  999 . however , at the shortest wavelengths available in the fuv spectra ( 1500  - 1600 ) , star  2 is a full 2  mag brighter than star  999 .",
    "thus the massive fuv excess exhibited by star  2 is not just relative to theoretical models , but also relative to other bss in the cluster .    returning to star  999 itself",
    ", it is interesting to note that the mass inferred from our fit to the nuv - nir sed is just over twice the turn - off mass in 47  tuc ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "this is interesting , since the formation of a bs with @xmath74  must involve three progenitors . such a `` supermassive '' bs ( smbs ) can not be formed in a single collision between two ms stars , nor via mass transfer in an ordinary binary system",
    ". unfortunately , the uncertainties on the mass of star  999 are too large to establish it as a smbs ( the statistical error alone is about 0.4  @xmath18 ) . the sample of bss analysed by de marco et al .",
    "( 2005 ) also contained several candidate smbss ( including one in ngc  6793 for which saffer et al .",
    "[ 2002 ] had derived a preliminary mass estimate of about @xmath75 ) . however , none of these candidates could be confirmed conclusively as smbss . at the moment , this leaves the bs - ms binary discovered by knigge et al .",
    "( 2006 ) as the most convincing candidate for a bs system with three progenitors in a gc core .",
    "however , the first definitive smbs remains to be discovered .",
    "since we have discovered and analysed a fair number of interesting and exotic objects in 47  tuc , it is worth considering some of the wider implications of our results . in the following sections , we will therefore take a look at three key issues : ( i ) the binary fraction in 47  tuc ; ( ii ) the nature and abundance of cvs in gcs ; ( iii ) the significance of systems that are unique even by the standard of most other exotica ( such as star  10 in our sample ) .",
    "we can use our results to obtain a rough estimate of the binary fraction amongst hot , young wds in 47  tuc . as a starting point",
    ", we note that our fuv photometry includes 25 objects brighter than @xmath23  and within our spectroscopic field of view .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmd ] shows that , above this limit , we have useable spectra for all gap objects , all but one bss and all objects on the wd cooling sequence . thus we use @xmath76  as an approximate completeness limit for the discovery of wd binary systems in our spectroscopic sample .    there are 5 objects without optical counterparts above this limit , as well as 5 objects on the wd cooling sequence for which we have no evidence of a companion . as a check",
    ", we visually inspected the vicinity of each of these 10 fuv sources in the deepest red optical image available . for most objects ,",
    "this was a 600  s f814w exposure .",
    "in a few cases , the location of interest fell outside the f814w field of view or on an image defect , so we used a 350  s f555w exposure instead .",
    "no additional red counterparts were found , down to an estimated limit of @xmath77  or better .",
    "this excludes the existence of ms companions as bright as that in star  7 .",
    "thus there are probably 10 single wds in our bright ( @xmath78 ) sub - sample .",
    "this same sub - sample also contains two very probable binary systems containing hot , young wds ( stars  2 and 7 ) , and one additional possible one ( star  15 ) .",
    "cvs have been excluded here , because their wds are probably accretion - heated , rather than young .",
    "we also exclude star  17 , partly because it is a candidate cv , and partly because it , too , could be a chance superposition .",
    "a rough estimate of the binary fraction amongst hot wds in the core of 47  tuc is then 2/13 ( assuming that star  15 is _ not _ a binary ) , i.e. @xmath79 . the statistical error on this estimate is solely due to small number statistics , whereas the quoted systematic error shows how the maximum - likelihood estimate would change if the true number of wd binaries in our sample was 1 or 3 , instead of 2 .",
    "clearly , this estimate needs to be viewed with great caution . aside from the issues of small number statistics and chance coincidences",
    ", we can not rule out the possibility of faint , lower ms companions to some of the apparently single wds in our sample . on the other hand , the number of wds ( objects near the cooling sequence in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , as well as objects without a f336w counterpart ) rises considerably more steeply towards fainter magnitudes than the numbers of gap sources and bss .",
    "since stars  2 and 15 were found amongst the latter two classes , our binary candidate haul may have been unusually lucky .",
    "while the allowed range we have determined is not yet very constraining , it is certainly consistent with the much more accurate estimates of the binary fraction determined by albrow et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in the core of 47  tuc .",
    "they found @xmath80  based on the number of eclipsing binaries in their data , and @xmath81  based on the number of w  uma stars .",
    "even though the estimate presented here is much less accurate , it is the first to be derived from the wd population of a gc and demonstrates the potential of fuv surveys in this area . given the importance of core binary fractions to cluster dynamics  and the present controversy surrounding the theoretical predictions ( ivanova et al .",
    "2005 ; hurley , aarseth & shara 2007 ; fregeau 2007 )  more accurate wd - based estimates could be extremely valuable .",
    "theoretical models for cv formation in gcs predict that a cluster like 47  tuc should harbour @xmath82 , mostly dynamically - formed cvs ( di stefano & rappaport 1994 ; ivanova et al .",
    "2006 ; but also see townsley & bildsten 2005 ) .",
    "even though recent surveys have at last begun to uncover a sizeable population of cv candidates in gcs , there is still a clear shortfall in the observed numbers relative to these predictions .",
    "for example , the combination of deep chandra x - ray surveys and optical follow - up has so far led to the identification of @xmath83  probable cvs in 47  tuc ( grindlay et al .",
    "2001a ; edmonds et al .",
    "2003ab ; heinke et al .",
    "2005 ) . however , it is still not clear if this discrepancy points to a problem with our understanding of cv formation and/or evolution , or if it is simply due to observational incompleteness ( see heinke et al .",
    "2005 , ivanova et al .",
    "2006 and maccarone & knigge 2007 for discussions of this point ) .",
    "the present results are relevant to this issue for several reasons .",
    "first , the discovery of emission lines in three previously suggested cv candidates in our spectroscopic sample ( star  1  =  ako  9 ; star  3  =  v1 ; star  20  =  v2 ) confirms that combined x - ray- , colour- and variability - based searches are , in fact , finding genuine cvs .",
    "this is rather important , since only seven other cvs have so far been spectroscopically confirmed in all galactic gcs combined .",
    "the only good cv candidate that was not confirmed spectroscopically is star  10 = pc1-v36 .",
    "this object was highlighted as a possible cv in paper  i , based on its fuv brightness , variability and possible match to an x - ray < source . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : star10 ] , we now find that star  10 is an even more exotic system .",
    "second , we have detected the secondary stars in two of our cvs . in star  1",
    "=  ako  9 , the donor is a subgiant , whereas in star  20  =  v2 , it is a lower - ms star .",
    "moreover , our sed fit to star  3  =  v1 constrains the secondary in this systems to be a lower - ms star also . in principle , the distribution of donor properties in the cv population is a strong constraint on theoretical models .",
    "for example , di stefano & rappaport ( 1994 ) predict quite a sizeable population of bright , long - period cvs with evolved donors ( like ako  9 ) in 47  tuc , whereas such systems are relatively rare in the simulations of ivanova et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . as the number of known gc cvs grows",
    ", the distributions of orbital period and donor spectral type will become a powerful way to test models of cv formation and evolution .",
    "third , we estimated in paper  i that @xmath84  cvs should be contained in our fuv imaging survey , based on the predictions by di stefano & rappaport ( 1994 ) . thus theory and observation",
    "would agree perfectly if essentially all gap objects in figure  [ fig : cmd ] were cvs .",
    "even though our spectroscopic sample comprises only half ( 8/16 ) of the photometrically identified gap objects , it is clear that this scenario is too optimistic .",
    "more specifically , even if we include the marginal detection of line emission in star  17 , only half ( 4/8 ) of the gap objects in the spectroscopic sample are confirmed as cvs .",
    "is it possible that some or all of the other four gap objects in the spectroscopic sample are nevertheless cvs that we have caught in a state of weak or absent line emission ?",
    "we believe this is extremely unlikely .",
    "the spectroscopic / sed classifications for three of these gap objects convincingly show that they are _ not _ cvs : star  4 is a he  wd , star  10 is a different kind of exotic binary containing a stripped subgiant ; star  27 is an smc interloper .",
    "this leaves star  15 as the only other viable candidate .",
    "however , the possibility that it is really a cv seems remote , given the lack of x - ray emission and fuv variability ( paper  i ) , as well as the possibility that the match between fuv and optical sources could be a chance coincidence ( section  [ sec : star15 ] ) .",
    "overall then , our results suggest that cvs comprise no more than @xmath85% of the population in the gap , at least among the brighter objects .",
    "nevertheless , taken at face value , this implies that predicted and observed numbers differ by `` only '' a factor of about two or three .",
    "however , this conclusion is not yet completely robust , both due to the small number statistics involved , and because different theoretical models predict different cv luminosity functions and hence different numbers of observable systems ( di stefano & rappaport 1994 ; ivanova et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we finally want to briefly highlight what are arguably the three most exotic objects we have uncovered . these are star  2 ( a bs - wd binary ) , star  4 ( a he wd ) and star  10  =  pc1-v36 ( a binary containing a dark primary and stripped subgiant secondary ) .",
    "we have already outlined possible formation scenarios for these systems in sections  [ sec : star2 ] , [ sec : star4 ] , and [ sec : star10 ] , so we will not repeat these here . instead , we just note that our fuv survey has turned out to be an efficient way of finding and classifying such remarkable systems .",
    "the gap between the wd and main sequences in the fuv - optical cmd seems to be a particularly fertile hunting ground in this respect : both stars  4 and 10 are found amongst only 8 gap sources in our spectroscopic sample .    aside from being intrinsically interesting , the most extreme objects in gcs are important precisely because they are probably quite hard to form",
    ". star  10 may be a good example of this .",
    "the very existence of such a system may point to a single , specific formation mechanism .",
    "this contrasts with the relatively more common types of stellar exotica , for which there is usually more than one formation channel ( for an example in the cv context , see figure  7 in ivanova et al .",
    "thus a single unique object can be the smoking gun that establishes the importance of a particular dynamical process in gcs .",
    "we have presented and analysed fuv spectroscopy for 48 blue objects in the core of 47  tucanae . for the 12 most interesting and representative cases , we have also assembled broad - band , fuv - nir spectral energy distributions in order to determine their nature .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "we have spectroscopically confirmed three previously known or suspected cvs in the cluster core ( v1 , v2 and ako  9 ) . for two of these ( v2 and ako  9 ) , we have also found photometric evidence of dwarf nova eruptions in addition to those that were previously known .",
    "2 .   only one other source ",
    "star  17 , a `` gap object '' located between the wd and main sequences in the cmd  exhibits marginal evidence for line emission in its spectrum .",
    "thus the gap region is not exclusively populated by cvs , nor are these systems common amongst objects near the top of the wd cooling sequence .",
    "nevertheless , predicted and observed numbers of cvs agree to within a factor of about 2 - 3 .",
    "3 .   we have discovered a hot ( @xmath0  k ) , large ( @xmath86 ) , but very low - mass ( @xmath87 ) secondary star in a previously known 0.8  d binary system .",
    "this exotic object , star  10 , fills or nearly fills its roche - lobe and completely dominates the binary s fuv - nir output .",
    "we suggest that this star is the remains of a subgiant that has been almost completely stripped of its envelope .",
    "this stripping could have occurred as a result of mass transfer in the binary system , or during the dynamical interaction that actually formed the system . since the stripped secondary must be in a short - lived evolutionary state",
    ", this object may represent the `` smoking gun '' of a recent dynamical encounter .",
    "4 .   we have also found a helium wd in 47  tuc ( star  4 ) .",
    "this is only the second optically detected such object in this cluster , and the first outside an msp system .",
    "the he wd could have been formed in a primordial binary , or in a binary system formed in an exchange encounter involving a massive ns or wd .",
    "no sign of a companion is seen in our data .",
    "5 .   we have discovered a bright bs with a young wd companion ( star  2 ) .",
    "this is the only bs - wd binary known in any gc .",
    "however , the apparent rarity of such objects might be a selection effect . since bs are much brighter than wds at optical wavelengths , such binaries have been hard to find until now . in our fuv spectrum",
    ", the existence of a hot wd companion to the bs can be inferred from a strong fuv excess at the shortest wavelengths .",
    "in addition to the objects already discussed , we have found two more candidate wd binary systems . in one of these ( star  15 ) ,",
    "the apparent companion is a ms star , but this composite object may well be the product of a chance coincidence",
    ". however , the other system ( star  7 ) _ is _ likely to be a genuine binary , and the companion in this case is a sub - giant . 7 .",
    "we have used the number of wd binary systems we have found to place a crude constraint on the wd binary fraction in the core of 47  tuc .",
    "we find @xmath88 .",
    "much stronger constraints can in principle be obtained from larger wd samples constructed from fuv surveys . 8 .",
    "an sed fit to the optically brightest bs in our spectroscopic sample suggests that the mass of this star may exceed twice the turn - off mass .",
    "however , the uncertainties on the mass estimate are too large for this to be conclusive .",
    "there is still no definitive example of such a `` supermassive '' bs in any gc .",
    "overall , we feel that the present study is an excellent illustration of the wide range of stellar exotica that are lurking in the cores of gcs .",
    "in particular , the gap region of the cmd seems to harbour quite a variety of weird and wonderful objects .",
    "most of these systems will have undergone significant dynamical encounters or perhaps have even been formed in one .",
    "all of this reenforces the motivation for studying these systems .",
    "we also hope to have shown that fuv surveys  and particularly multi - object slitless fuv specroscopy  provide an excellent and efficient way of achieving this goal .",
    "the power of this approach is greatest , however , when it is used in combination with data spanning the widest possible range in wavelength ( e.g. the fuv - nir range ) . with such panchromatic data sets , we can determine the nature of most of the exotic stellar systems that are hiding in gc cores .",

    "<S> we present far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) spectroscopy obtained with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ for 48 blue objects in the core of 47  tuc . based on their position in a fuv - optical colour - magnitude diagram , </S>",
    "<S> these were expected to include cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , blue stragglers ( bss ) , white dwarfs ( wds ) and other exotic objects . for a subset of these sources </S>",
    "<S> , we also construct broad - band , fuv through near - infrared spectral energy distributions . based on our analysis of this extensive data set , </S>",
    "<S> we report the following main results . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) we detect emission lines in three previously known or suspected cvs and thus spectroscopically confirm the status of these systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect new dwarf nova eruptions in two of these cvs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) only one other source in our spectroscopic sample exhibits marginal evidence for line emission . </S>",
    "<S> thus cvs are not the only class of objects found in the gap between the wd and main sequences , nor are they common amongst objects near the top of the wd cooling sequence . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , predicted and observed numbers of cv agree to within a factor of about 2 - 3 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) we have discovered a hot ( @xmath0  k ) , low - mass ( @xmath1 )   secondary star in a previously known 0.8  d binary system . </S>",
    "<S> this exotic object completely dominates the binary s fuv - nir output and is probably the remnant of a subgiant that has been stripped of its envelope . since this object must be in a short - lived evolutionary state </S>",
    "<S> , it may represent the `` smoking gun '' of a recent dynamical encounter . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) we have found a helium wd , only the second such object to be optically detected in 47  tuc , and the first outside a millisecond pulsar system . ( 5 ) we have discovered a bright bs with a young wd companion , the only bs - wd binary known in any gc . ( 6 ) we have found two additional candidate wd binary systems , one containing a ms companion , the other containing a subgiant . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) we estimate the wd binary fraction in the core of 47  tuc to be @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 8) the mass of the optically brightest bs in our sample may exceed twice the cluster turn - off mass , but the uncertainties are too large for this to be conclusive . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is still no definitive example of such a `` supermassive '' bs in any gc . taken as a whole </S>",
    "<S> , our study illustrates the wide range of stellar exotica that are lurking in the cores of gcs , most of which are likely to have undergone significant dynamical encounters . </S>"
