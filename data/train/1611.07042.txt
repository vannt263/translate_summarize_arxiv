    "since the discovery of cosmic acceleration @xcite , measuring the properties of dark energy with type ia supernovae ( sneia ) has been predicated on the spectroscopic confirmation of snia candidates . however , as the size of individual snia samples surpasses 1,000 sne , obtaining spectra for each type ia candidate is becoming prohibitively expensive .",
    "only a small fraction of sneia from current and future surveys such as the dark energy survey ( des ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) will have spectroscopic classification .",
    "without spectroscopic classification , core - collapse sn ( ccsn ) contamination can bias our estimates of cosmological parameters ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    without sn spectroscopy",
    ", the shape and color of a photometric sn light curve can be used as a less precise way to determine the type .",
    "@xcite used light curves to classify 752 sne as likely type ia , enough to measure the dark energy equation of state , @xmath1 , with @xmath010% statistical uncertainty .",
    "their sample was selected from light curve properties and a classifier that compares each observed light curve to snia and ccsn templates ( psnid ; @xcite ) .",
    "their final sample comprised just 3.9% ccsne . while @xcite is the _ only _ snia - based measurement of @xmath1 to date that does not use spectroscopic classification for its sne , the measurement does not include systematic uncertainties .",
    "in addition , contaminating ccsne bias their measurements of snia dispersion and the correlation between sn luminosity and light curve rise / decline rate by @xmath060% .    many light curve classifiers use the `` nave bayes '' approximation , which assumes all observables that indicate sn type are uncorrelated .",
    "machine learning techniques can often outperform these classifiers , yielding higher snia classification efficiency ( the fraction of sneia classified correctly ) and lower ccsn contamination @xcite .",
    "on sdss sn data , the @xcite kd - tree nearest neighbor ( nn ) method has a purity comparable to @xcite but accurately classifies @xmath01.4 times as many real sneia in a given sample .",
    "an important caveat is that nearly all classifiers are optimized on simulations with little evaluation on real data .",
    "simulations , in turn , depend on ccsn templates and knowledge of the ccsn luminosity functions ( lfs ) and rates .",
    "ccsne are diverse , far more so than sneia , and only a limited number of high - quality templates are publicly available . training a classifier directly on survey data is possible but can be sub - optimal due to limited numbers of ccsne observed and the dependence of classifier results on the specific survey characteristics ( e.g. observing cadences , filters , and signal - to - noise ratios ) .",
    "we can make sn classification less dependent on ccsn templates , lfs , and rates by incorporating host galaxy data . because many sneia have a @xmath71 gyr delay time between progenitor formation and explosion @xcite , they are the only type of sne found in early - type galaxies ( with very few known exceptions ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that it was possible to accurately classify the @xmath020% of sneia found in elliptical galaxies if the morphology of their host galaxy is known .",
    "though these results are encouraging , it is unlikely that light curve and host galaxy classification alone will enable a measurement of @xmath1 as precise as measurements using spectroscopically classified sne ( e.g. @xcite , @xmath8 ) .",
    "a difference in @xmath1 of 5% corresponds to a change of 0.02 mag from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ; if ccsne are 1 mag fainter than sneia on average , a bias of 0.02 mag can be induced by just 2% ccsn contamination at low-@xmath11 in a survey like ps1 .",
    "if the contaminating distribution of ccsne is more than 1 mag fainter ( this depends on survey malmquist bias ) , it takes even fewer ccsne to bias @xmath1 by an equivalent amount .    a bayesian method ,",
    "however , could use the probabilities that sne are of type ia as priors to simultaneously determine distances to ia and ccsne without bias .",
    "we refer to this method as bayesian estimation applied to multiple species ( beams ) following @xcite ( hereafter kbh07 ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "kbh07 test beams on a simplistic sn simulation and find that it gives near - optimal accuracy and uncertainties on snia distances .",
    "@xcite test beams further with monte carlo simulations of the sloan digital sky survey sn survey ( sdss - sn ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "beams biases measurements of the cosmic matter and dark energy densities , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , by less than the statistical uncertainties in their simulations .",
    "their results demonstrated that sdss sne without spectroscopic classification can significantly improve cosmological constraints relative to the sdss spectroscopic sample @xcite .",
    "@xcite did not measure the systematic uncertainties from their method .    as with sdss , pan - starrs ( ps1 ) discovered far more sneia than could be observed spectroscopically .",
    "spectroscopically - confirmed sneia from the first @xmath01/3 of ps1 have been used to measure cosmological parameters but constitute only a small fraction of the available data ( @xcite , hereafter r14 ; @xcite ) . in this study",
    ", we use ps1 sne with and without spectroscopic classification as a tool for testing sn classifiers , understanding ccsn contaminants and measuring the systematic error due to ccsn contamination . in total , ps1 has  sne with high quality light curves and spectroscopic redshifts that can be used to measure cosmological parameters ( including a @xmath0few percent ccsn contamination ) . here , we focus on the likely sneia with spectroscopic host galaxy redshifts , 143 of which are spectroscopically confirmed , in order to study a sample with fewer selection biases (  [ sec : hostz ] ) .",

    "the r14 ps1 cosmology analysis has a low-@xmath11 sample with higher intrinsic dispersion than the ps1 sample .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion , @xmath48 , is defined as the value added in quadrature to the snia distance modulus uncertainty such that the hubble diagram reduced @xmath35 is equal to 1 @xcite .",
    "differences in snia intrinsic dispersion from survey to survey are typical , with the likely source of the variation including underestimated photometric difference image uncertainties and excess scatter from bright host galaxy subtractions ( as seen in r14 and @xcite ) .",
    "redshift evolution of the snia population could also play a role .",
    "we added 0.05 mag in quadrature to the @xmath40 uncertainties of the low-@xmath11 sne to resolve the discrepancy .",

    "this adjustment is necessary due to the non - gaussian wings of the ps1 psf and the psf fitting radius used by the ps1 pipeline .",
    "mismatched host galaxies and incorrect redshifts .",
    "as discussed previously , we expect  of our redshifts to be incorrect due to mismatched host galaxies and redshift measurement uncertainties .",
    "we used snana to simulate incorrect host redshifts by assigning false , `` measured '' redshifts to 2.6% of our sne .",
    "these redshifts are drawn from a flat , random distribution between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this is the range of redshifts at which ps1 can discover sne , with the exception of rare superluminous sne .",

    "there are a few potential explanations for the difference in hubble residuals between simulations and data . in this section ,",
    "we attempt to identify the cause of the discrepancy .",
    "first , a large percentage ( @xmath720% ) of inaccurate snia redshifts could explain the data .",
    "however , in addition to disagreeing with our measurements , this would give too many simulated sne with very bright and very faint hubble residuals .",
    "requiring a high tdr value and a small separation between the sn location and host galaxy center in our data does not resolve the conflict .",
    "a second option is that the relative rates or magnitude distributions from @xcite are erroneous or are biased by the targeted nature of the survey ( loss searched for sne in a set of pre - selected bright galaxies ) .",
    "these rates also do not take into account that the relative fractions of different ccsn subtypes could change with redshift .",
    "modest adjustments , such as `` tweaking '' the mean magnitudes or dispersions of ccsne by @xmath690.5 mag , can not explain the discrepancy .",
    "simulating ccsne using lfs from @xcite , which are typically @xmath00.3 - 1.0 mag brighter than @xcite , produces far too many bright ccsne compared to our data .",
    "the effect of weak lensing on the data is expected to be an order of magnitude less than the size of the offset we see here @xcite .",
    "it is also unlikely that strongly lensed sne contribute significantly to the discrepancy @xcite .    by re - classifying loss sne",
    ", @xcite recently found that snib relative rates were more than double the fraction found by @xcite .",
    "this change could reduce the hubble residual discrepancy by half or more .",
    "however , @xcite determined these rates by re - classifying a number of loss sneic as sneib , which in turn means that the snib lf should be made fainter . making the",
    "snib lf fainter will increase the discrepancy in hubble residuals .",
    "we continue to use @xcite in this work , as we can be sure that the lfs and relative rates are self - consistent .",
    "finally , we consider that our results could be biased if snana templates have lower average reddening than ps1 data . in this work",
    ", we make the assumption that reddening in the templates is approximately equal to reddening in our data .",
    "this assumption allows us to use the @xcite lfs , which have not been corrected for reddening , and snana templates , which also include intrinsic reddening . in reality",
    ", there are likely substantial differences between the reddening distribution of the templates and the data .",
    "however , we find that adding additional reddening to our simulations tends to make the magnitude distribution of ccsne more broad ( we approximately adjust the @xcite lfs for dust following @xcite )",

    "psnid is more accurate than the nn classifier by the metric in figure [ fig : prob ] , but psnid has @xmath0twice as many contaminants with p(ia ) @xmath45 0.95 , which could bias the beams distances .      the  method estimates p(ia ) from the @xmath35 and number of degrees of freedom of the salt2 light curve fit ( the salt2 fit probability ) .",
    "because the salt2 fit @xmath35 has no knowledge about the relative frequency of different sn types , we multiplied p@xmath130(ia ) , the  probability , by a redshift - dependent sn rates prior , p(ia@xmath131 ) .",
    "p(ia@xmath131 ) is the number of sneia divided by the total number of sne at a given redshift ( after sample cuts ; measured using the j16 simulations ) :    @xmath132    compared to the nn ( baseline ) classifier ,  has a comparable fraction of contaminants at p(ia ) @xmath45 0.5 .",
    "however , the fraction of ccsne with high p(ia ) is higher by a factor of @xmath040% .",
    "sneia have much longer average delay times between progenitor formation and explosion than ccsne .",
    "because of this , sneia are the only sn type found in early type hosts .",
    "this allows methods such as galsnid @xcite to classify sne with host galaxy information .",
    "the galsnid method in @xcite is based on photometric information and is highly dependent on host morphology . because measuring galaxy morphologies at typical ps1 redshifts requires @xmath00.1  image resolution , we modified the method by adding spectral observables .",
    "though galsnid is a very inefficient classifier , it measures snia probabilities in a way that is only minimally subject to light curve and lf uncertainties .",
    "to train galsnid , we used 602 host galaxy spectra from the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ; @xcite ) and 354 host galaxy spectra of ps1 spectroscopically - confirmed sne .",
    "the equivalent widths of spectral emission lines , and h@xmath4 in particular , correlate with sn type .",
    "another useful diagnostic is the template that cross - correlates best with the observed host spectrum .",
    "finally , we include host galaxy @xmath17 ( labeled effective offset in @xcite ) , @xmath133 colors and absolute @xmath134 magnitudes from @xcite .",
    "our full methodology is presented in the appendix , along with the bayesian probabilities that a sn is of type ia for different spectral parameters from our training sample .",
    "we use the nave bayes assumption for this work following @xcite , which treats all observables as uncorrelated . in future work",
    "we hope to use machine learning techniques to improve galsnid classifications .    to create galsnid probabilities for the simulated sample , we artificially redshifted loss host galaxy spectra , added noise to make them consistent with the snr of ps1 host spectra , and used galsnid to measure the probability that each host observed a snia .",
    "we took the distributions of galsnid probabilities for the redshifted , noisy spectra corresponding to loss sne ii , ib / c and ia hosts in each simulated redshift bin and assigned the probabilities drawn from those distributions to simulated sne ii , ib / c and ia .",
    "this gave our simulated sne the same probability distributions as the redshifted loss data .",
    "figure [ fig : prob ] shows that galsnid is a relatively imprecise classifier , but it provides constraints that are independent of sn light curves and their associated uncertainties .",
    "we have not taken into account the redshift evolution of sn host galaxies in this work .",
    "on ps1 data , galsnid is by far the least efficient classifier .",
    "because classifications are highly influenced by the rates prior , galsnid considers just 10% of contaminants to be likely ccsne .",
    "if we set a higher threshold of p(ia ) @xmath45 0.9 , galsnid removes @xmath030% of ccsne and keeps @xmath070% of sneia .",
    "galsnid is also most effective at @xmath135 , where h@xmath4 is present in our optical spectra ( the best indicator of sn type in our spectra ) .",
    "unfortunately , the largest snia distance biases are at @xmath136 , where the ccsn distribution becomes blended with the snia distribution .",
    "galsnid would also be useful as an additional prior on sn type in conjunction with other methods . however , due to uncertainty in ccsn models and lfs , in the present analysis we consider it most powerful as a stand - alone tool that can measure snia probabilities without using light curve data .      ps1 and other spectroscopic data show that sneia are well - represented by a gaussian hubble residual model , but ccsne are not .",
    "we investigated replacing the ccsn likelihood in eq .",
    "[ eqn : beamslike ] with two likelihoods that are more consistent with our ccsn simulations .",
    "we tested a two - gaussian model with ten additional free parameters for ccsne ( the means and standard deviations of the second gaussian at five redshift control points ) .",
    "we also tested a single , asymmetric gaussian model with five additional free parameters ( skewness at each ccsn control point ) .    if we allow beams to shift and/or rescale the prior probabilities that a sn is of type ia ( eq . [ eqn : norm ] ) , beams can give unphysical results .",
    "the alternative ccsn models are significantly more flexible and that flexibility must be constrained by accurate , fixed prior probabilities such as those from nn ( see  [ sec : beamserr ] ) .",
    "we fix the parameters that allow beams to adjust the priors ( @xmath137 and @xmath138 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : norm ] ) or else the uncertainties on snia distances will inflate to @xmath450.1 mag for even our best - measured redshift control points .",
    "in total , we test three additional methods of determining prior probability ( psnid , , galsnid ) and two additional ccsn models .",
    "we test each variant on 25 samples of 1,000 simulated ps1 sne and 25 samples of 104 real ps1 sne . though we discuss the ways in which distances and nuisance parameters are affected by these variants , we focus primarily on measurements of @xmath1 .",
    "the rms of these variants gives a conservative estimate of the systematic uncertainty on @xmath1 , @xmath2 , an error which could be reduced in the future by improved sn classification methods .",

    "the other variants increase statistical uncertainty on @xmath1 by @xmath1425% ( see  [ sec : beamserr ] ) .",
    "we compare these measurements of @xmath1 to the case where beams has minimal prior information : we set p(ia ) @xmath99 1/2 for all photometric sne while still fixing p(ia ) @xmath99 1 for low-@xmath11 sne .",
    "the bias on @xmath1 from this approach is -0.018 , 40% higher than the galsnid bias and is slightly lower than the bias .",

    "@xmath2 is an average of 0.024 , 27% of the statistical error . in figure",
    "[ fig : wmc ] we show that the the _ average _ measurements of @xmath1 from each variant have a lower dispersion of 0.011 , just 13% the r14 statistical error .",
    "biases in nuisance parameters are similar to our baseline method ( figure [ fig : nuisance_real ] ) .",
    "just as we see in simulations , it appears that  and galsnid appear to bias @xmath5 more than other methods , though the difference has just @xmath01@xmath6 significance . @xmath4 and @xmath124 are largely consistent across all methods .",
    "it is likely that nuisance parameters in the real data appear less biased than in simulations because in ps1 data , the low-@xmath11 spectroscopically confirmed sample is a much larger fraction of the full sample .",
    "figure [ fig : wmc ] also shows the statistical uncertainties on @xmath1 from subsets of ps1 data .",
    "uncertainties are higher than r14 by @xmath4512% .",
    "the highest uncertainties come from  and galsnid , which have up to 18% higher uncertainty on @xmath1 than r14 .",
    "much of the increase in uncertainty in other variants is likely because ps1 photometric sne have lower mean snr than ps1 spectroscopically - confirmed sne .",
    "r14 sne have a median snr at peak of @xmath050 , while photometric sne have a median snr at peak of just 16 .",
    "the ps1 photometric sn sample is the largest snia sample , but using it to optimally measure cosmological parameters requires accurate sn type probabilities .",
    "these in turn rely on our understanding of the ps1 sample and the ccsne in it .",
    "evaluating how our incomplete knowledge of ccsne could bias the results is difficult . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how ccsn simulations could be improved in the future .",
    "we also present alternatives to our implementation of beams and measure the degree to which different methods and priors affect the statistical uncertainty on @xmath1 .",
    "measuring the reliability of our method would be subject to fewer uncertainties if ccsn simulations were more robust .",
    "these simulations are currently subject to two primary limiting factors : the assumption that the ccsn lf is gaussian with measured mean and rms from @xcite and the lack of ccsn template diversity .",
    "figure [ fig : ccsne ] shows that the assumption of the shape of ccsn lfs could have a strong impact on the fraction of bright ccsne . while the malmquist bias for sneia is @xmath00.1 mag at maximum , type ii sne observed at the median ps1 survey redshift are up to 3 magnitudes @xmath16 and 2 - 3 standard deviations @xmath16 brighter than the peak of their lf . determining the frequency of such bright ccsne requires measuring the shapes of their lfs with better statistics than what is currently available from volume - limited surveys such as @xcite . due to low statistics ,",
    "our current simulations treat the lfs of each sn subtype as gaussian , a flawed assumption .",
    "generating more robust simulations also requires additional , diverse ccsn templates .",
    "our simulations sample the luminosity , shape , and color distribution of most ccsn subtypes with just a few templates .",
    "in addition , the luminosity distribution of these templates is heavily biased ; nearly all ccsne currently used as templates are much brighter than the mean luminosity of their subtypes .",
    "our method makes these bright templates fainter to match the @xcite lfs , implicitly assuming that faint ccsne have similar light curves to bright ccsne .",
    "a better approach would be to have ccsn templates that sample the full range of luminosity space for ccsne .",
    "we note that additional high - snr ccsn light curves and spectra exist , but require careful smoothing , interpolation , and spectral mangling to be a reliable addition to the snana template library .",
    "we have added sneia-91bg and sniib templates to snana , but assembling and mangling all available ccsn light curves and templates is beyond the scope of this work .    in the absence of additional templates and improved lf measurements , we can use galsnid and  classifications to give measurements of @xmath1 some degree of independence from these sources of uncertainty .",
    "though these classifiers are sub - optimal compared to classifiers such as nn , they give a unique set of probabilities that do not rely on simulations for training ( though  is implicitly dependent on the nature of ccsn light curves contaminating our sample ) .  and",
    "galsnid _ explicitly _ depend on simulations only through their rates priors .",
    "adjusting these priors by a factor of 2 biases @xmath1 by @xmath020% of the statistical uncertainty or less .      in determining cosmological parameters with the beams method we made a set of choices that minimized the number of free parameters while still reproducing the full cosmological parameter likelihoods .",
    "we found that most choices , e.g. varying priors or adding additional ccsn bins , made little difference provided that we had a large number of mcmc steps and few enough parameters .",
    "two additional choices can improve the systematic error due to ccsn contamination .",
    "first , though fixing @xmath4 and @xmath5 does not improve the accuracy of the beams method when using nn or psnid priors , it does improve the accuracy when using  and galsnid , methods with less accurate classifications . with @xmath4 and @xmath5 fixed ,  and",
    "galsnid are _ no more biased _ than the more sophisticated light curve based methods .",
    "if we choose to either keep @xmath4 and @xmath5 fixed in all beams variants or just in the  and galsnid variants , we find that the @xmath2 decreases by @xmath025% on average . in pan - starrs , spectroscopically - confirmed sne can measure these parameters with low uncertainty , and fixing them for our future cosmology analysis in some or all methods could be advantageous .",
    "the second method of improving beams is by cutting additional likely ccsne from the sample .",
    "following @xcite , we tested a cut on the nn prior probability by requiring @xmath144 .",
    "our simulations show that this cut removes @xmath050% of ccsne but just 2% of sneia .",
    "the rejected sample has @xmath050% ccsn contamination . because our baseline beams analysis uses nn probabilities , an nn probability cut yields no improvements to our baseline results .",
    "however , when this cut is added to our other classification methods , it reduces @xmath2 by @xmath030% on average .",
    "we have not included this cut in our systematic error analysis (  [ sec : varresults ] ) as it makes our classification methods more correlated and adds an additional dependence on uncertain simulations to the measured systematic error .",
    "however , it is likely that this cut will increase the consistency of the full ps1 cosmological results .",
    "a third option for beams is to estimate snia distances with a more strict ccsn model . @xcite",
    "adopt an approach where beams ccsn distributions are determined directly from simulations . for our ps1 analysis ,",
    "we have adopted a more general approach to ccsne at the cost of several additional parameters to marginalize over and a simpler form of the likelihood ( @xcite also suggest free ccsn parameters as a possible improvement to their method ) .",
    "tests show our parameterization is capable of marginalizing over the simulated ccsne such that the ia likelihood is recovered , and our method is slightly more general than a simulation - based method",
    ". a simulation - based mapping of ccsne may be more robust , but validating it thoroughly is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in particular , the influence of inaccurate simulations on its recovered results must be explored fully .      by setting p(ia ) @xmath99 1/2 for all photometric sne , the beams method measures @xmath1 with a bias of -0.019 , 0.4 times the statistical uncertainty on @xmath1 . the statistical uncertainty on @xmath1 from setting p(ia ) @xmath99 1/2 ,",
    "even with no prior information as to which sne are of type ia , is just 5% higher than using sneia alone .",
    "this is primarily due to two factors : the loose priors we employ and the fact that we include a sample of low-@xmath11 spectroscopically - confirmed sneia for which p(ia ) is fixed to 1 .",
    "these low-@xmath11 sneia help to set the snia dispersion and the sn parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which are fixed as a function of redshift .",
    "if we remove the low-@xmath11 sample , distance and sn parameter biases increase .",
    "distance uncertainties , which are higher by just @xmath010% when using the p(ia ) @xmath99 1/2 prior , increase by nearly 50% .",
    "nevertheless , beams does remarkably well at determining the gaussian distributions of sneia and ccsne with relatively little information .",
    "this is helped by the fact that because sneia have a factor of @xmath020 lower dispersion than ccsne , a loose prior on beams free parameters is sufficient to find the most probable gaussian distributions .",
    "if we use a more flexible ccsn model ( a two gaussian or skewed gaussian ccsn model ) , the requirements on our prior probabilities must become more stringent to yield precise distances .",
    "first , prior probabilities can no longer be re - normalized or shifted ( eq . [ eqn : norm ] ) @xmath16 these are parameters which can greatly improve the results for alternative prior probability methods .",
    "second , our prior probabilities must be significantly more accurate to yield results with low uncertainties . with the two - gaussian ccsn model , the uncertainty on @xmath1 increases by 20% when using galsnid priors and 100% when setting p(ia ) = 1/2 for all photometric sne .",
    "using the skewed gaussian model , galsnid and p(ia ) @xmath99 1/2 priors increase the uncertainties by 13% and 27% , respectively .",
    "note that galsnid classifications yield more precise measurements than a simple p(ia ) @xmath99 1/2 prior in these cases .",
    "fortunately , a single gaussian model for ccsne appears to yield unbiased distances even though the simulated distribution is not perfectly gaussian .",
    "in essence , beams attempts only to determine the gaussian distributions of two types of sne and fortunately , those distributions are relatively well - separated in dispersion even if they are not always well - separated in distance .",
    "we measured spectroscopic redshifts for  sn host galaxies in pan - starrs , nearly 1,000 of which are cosmologically - useful , likely sneia . when combined with the full ps1 spectroscopic sample ( scolnic et al . in prep . )",
    ", we will have at least cosmologically - useful sneia from ps1 .",
    "we find that currently available ccsn templates and luminosity functions are biased or incomplete .",
    "our results suggest there are too few bright ccsne in our simulations .",
    "we generate 25 simulations that closely resemble the ps1 sample .",
    "each has 1,000 photometric ps1 sne and 250 low-@xmath11 spectroscopically - confirmed sneia .",
    "these simulations show that our method can measure @xmath1 with a bias due to ccsn contamination of just ,  of the statistical uncertainty on @xmath1 .",
    "this equates to a systematic uncertainty on @xmath1 of just 0.005 , but this uncertainty could be affected by incomplete knowledge of the ccsn distribution .",
    "the snia dispersion , @xmath88 , is biased by -0.005 ( @xmath00.5@xmath6 ) , the salt2 shape parameter @xmath4 is biased by @xmath00.005 ( @xmath01@xmath6 ) , and the color parameter @xmath5 is biased by @xmath00.1 ( @xmath01.5@xmath6 ) .",
    "the statistical uncertainties on @xmath1 are nearly equivalent to those using only sneia .",
    "using several variants of the method , we conservatively estimate the systematic error introduced by ccsn contamination to be 0.014@xmath220.007 ( 30% of the statistical error ) .",
    "this systematic error could be reduced further by using a cut on prior probabilities from one variant to reduce ccsne in the sample for the other variants .",
    "if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are fixed to known values from a spectroscopic sample , our _ least _ accurate classifiers ,  and galsnid , are able to measure @xmath1 with mean bias of just 0.006 .    included in these variants",
    "are a total of four different classification methods to measure cosmology , including a host galaxy spectrum - based version of galsnid @xcite that we introduce in this work ( see appendix ) .",
    "galsnid is based only on snia host galaxy observables and a rates prior .",
    "galsnid provides a method of measuring @xmath1 from photometric data that does not depend on sn light curves and training on simulated data .",
    "machine learning techniques may be able to improve on the efficiency of this method in the future .    by drawing random samples from real ps1 data , we tested whether the beams method can work on real data within the confidence intervals of @xcite .",
    "we found that our measurements of @xmath1 were fully consistent with @xcite , as were the sn nuisance parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "though our results are robust , @xmath1 is an extremely sensitive measurement and the burden of proof for beams is high .",
    "future validation tests could include sdss and snls photometric data , as well as simulated tests with a variety of ccsn lfs .",
    "additional light curve classification methods could also help to improve the reliability of the beams method .",
    "future snia samples from des and lsst will be unable to rely solely on spectroscopic classification to measure cosmological parameters . with the light curve classification and bayesian methodologies presented here",
    ", we validate some of the techniques that will be used in future surveys , and anticipate that ps1 photometric sne can provide a robust measurement of @xmath1 using the largest snia sample to date .",

    "67% of the 905 sne discovered by loss have host galaxy spectra . in general , the snr of these data are high ( much higher on average than our redshift survey data ) .",
    "ps1 spectroscopically classified 520 sne of which @xmath0150 are ccsne and the rest are sneia .",
    "of the ccsne , @xmath030 are sne iin ( drout et al . in prep ) , 76 are ii - p or ii - l @xcite and @xmath020 - 30 are sne ib or ic .",
    "we obtained host galaxy spectra for 354 of these sne .",
    "we searched for a number of prominent , observational galaxy diagnostics that correlate with the age of the host , and found that the equivalent widths of bright emission lines such as oii , oiii , h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 are measurable in many of our spectra .",
    "we required continuum snr @xmath45 5 near a given line measurement for an observable to be used in training or classification . as a way to incorporate additional information in a single diagnostic , we included the best matched spectral template based on cross - correlation as an observable .",
    "although these diagnostics are correlated , in this work we follow @xcite in treating them as independent .",
    "final probabilities for a given sn can therefore be computed by multiplying the probability of a ia given each observable @xcite :      where @xmath146 is the number of observables and p(d@xmath147ia ) is the probability of an observable given that the sn is type ia ( table [ table : galsnid ] ) .",
    "p(d@xmath147ia ) is easy to compute ; it is the fraction of snia host galaxies that have observable d@xmath148 .",
    "p(ia@xmath131 ) is a rates prior informed by our snana simulations .",
    "@xmath149 is a normalization factor that requires @xmath150 .",

    "the probabilities from our loss+ps1 training sample are provided in table [ table : galsnid ] .",
    "we also include effective offset , @xmath133 colors , and @xmath134 absolute magnitudes using probabilities measured from @xcite and sed fits using ps1 host galaxy photometry .",
    "note that because h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 are almost perfectly correlated ( the correlation coefficient is 0.94 ) , we do not use h@xmath5 as an observable when h@xmath4 is present in optical spectra ( @xmath135 ) .",
