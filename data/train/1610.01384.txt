    "in this section , we recall some basic facts about billiards and conics ; see , e.g. , @xcite and , specifically , @xcite .    we consider billiards as a discrete - time dynamical system acting on oriented lines : an incoming billiard trajectory hits the billiard curve and",
    "reflects so that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection .",
    "equivalently , one may think in terms of geometrical optics : oriented lines are rays of light , and the billiard curve is an ideal mirror .",
    "the space of oriented lines has an area form that is preserved by the optical reflections ( independently of the shape of the mirror ) .",
    "choose an origin , and introduce coordinates @xmath11 on the space of rays : @xmath12 is the direction of the ray , and @xmath13 is its signed distance to the origin , see figure [ coord ] . then the invariant area form is as follows : @xmath14 .",
    "this symplectic structure is obtained by symplectic reduction from the canonical symplectic structure of the cotangent bundle @xmath15 .",
    "this construction is quite general , and it yields a symplectic structure on the space of oriented non - parameterized geodesics of a riemannian manifold ( assuming that this space is a smooth manifold ) .",
    "for example , this is the case in the spherical and hyperbolic geometries .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for details .",
    "a caustic of a billiard is a curve @xmath16 with the following property : if a segment of a billiard trajectory is tangent to @xmath16 then so is each reflected segment .",
    "consider an oval ( closed smooth strictly convex curve ) and fix a point @xmath17 on it .",
    "for a point @xmath18 outside of the oval , consider two functions : @xmath19 see figure [ string ] .",
    "the gradients of these functions are the unit vectors along the lines @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "it follows that these two lines make equal angles with the level curves of the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and that these level curves are orthogonal to each other .",
    "the function @xmath22 does not depend on the choice of the reference point @xmath17 .",
    "its level curves are given by the string construction : wrap a closed nonelastic string around an oval , pull it tight at a point , and move this point around the oval .",
    "this construction recovers a 1-parameter family of billiard curves from a common caustic ( the length of the string is a parameter ) .",
    "the interior of an ellipse is foliated by confocal ellipses .",
    "these are caustics of the billiard inside an ellipse , see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 28.2 ) .",
    "thus one has graves s theorem : wrapping a closed nonelastic string around an ellipse produces a confocal ellipse .",
    "since confocal ellipses and hyperbolas are orthogonal , an ellipse is also a caustic for reflection in a confocal hyperbola , see figure [ reflection ] .",
    "if a ray passes between the foci of an ellipse then it is tangent to a confocal hyperbola , and all the reflected rays are tangent to the same confocal hyperbola which , in this case , is a caustic .",
    "the space of rays @xmath3 that intersect an ellipse is topologically a cylinder , and the billiard system inside the ellipse is an area preserving transformation @xmath24 .",
    "the cylinder is foliated by the invariant curves of the map @xmath25 consisting of the rays tangent to confocal conics , see figure [ portrait ] .",
    "the curves that go around the cylinder correspond to the rays that are tangent to confocal ellipses , and the curves that form ` the eyes ' to the rays that are tangent to confocal hyperbolas .",
    "a singular curve consists of the rays through the foci , and the two dots to the 2-periodic back and forth orbit along the minor axis of the ellipse .",
    "one can choose a cyclic parameter , say , @xmath26 modulo 1 , on each invariant curve such that the map @xmath25 becomes a shift @xmath27 , where the constant @xmath28 depends on the invariant curve .",
    "this is a manifestation of the arnold - liouville theorem in the theory of completely integrable systems , see @xcite .",
    "the construction is as follows .",
    "choose a function @xmath29 whose level curves are the invariant curves that foliate @xmath3 , and consider its hamiltonian vector field sgrad @xmath29 with respect to the area form @xmath30 .",
    "this vector field is tangent to the invariant curves , and the desired coordinate @xmath26 on these curves is the one in which sgrad @xmath29 is a constant vector field @xmath31 .",
    "changing @xmath29 scales the coordinate @xmath26 on each invariant curve and , normalizing the ` length ' of the invariant curves to 1 , fixes @xmath26 uniquely up to an additive constant . in other words , the 1-form @xmath32 is well defined on each invariant curve .",
    "the billiard map @xmath25 preserves the area form and the invariant curves , therefore its restriction to each curve preserves the measure @xmath32 , hence , is a shift @xmath27 .",
    "an immediate consequence is the poncelet porism : if a billiard trajectory in an ellipse closes up after a number of reflections then all trajectories with the same caustic close up after the same number of reflections ( the general form of the poncelet porism is obtained by applying a projective transformation to a pair of confocal conics ) .",
    "note that the invariant measure @xmath32 on the invariant curves does not depend on the choice of the billiard curve from a confocal family : all confocal ellipses share their caustics .",
    "this implies that the billiard transformations with respect to two confocal ellipses commute : restricted to a common caustic , both are shifts in the same coordinate system",
    ". see figure [ commute ] .",
    "we identify the invariant curves with the respective conics and refer to the coordinate @xmath26 as the canonical coordinate .",
    "consider an ellipse @xmath16 , and let @xmath26 be the canonical coordinate on it .",
    "this makes it possible to define coordinates in the exterior of the ellipse : the coordinates of a point @xmath18 outside of @xmath16 are the coordinates @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the tangency points of the tangent lines from @xmath18 to @xmath16 ( points @xmath3 and @xmath35 in figure [ string ] ) .",
    "the above discussion implies that the confocal ellipses are given by the equations @xmath36 const .",

    ", the arc of an ellipse @xmath43 bisects the angles @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath46 , the infinitesimal quadrilateral @xmath47 becomes a kite : the diagonal @xmath43 is its axis of symmetry .",
    "hence @xmath48 , and the locus of points given by the equation @xmath49 const and containing points @xmath3 and @xmath17 is orthogonal to the ellipse through points @xmath35 and @xmath40 .",
    "therefore this locus is a confocal hyperbola .",
    "let us summarize .",
    "consider figure [ reflection ] again . in the coordinate @xmath26 on the inner ellipse ,",
    "the billiard reflections in a confocal ellipse and a confocal hyperbola are given , respectively , by the formulas @xmath50 where the constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 depend on the choice of the outer ellipse and the hyperbola .",
    "recall the statement of ivory s lemma : the diagonals of a quadrilateral made by arcs of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas are equal : in figure [ ivl ] , @xmath53 .    the idea of the proof is very simple .",
    "imagine that we need to prove that the diagonals of a rectangle are equal .",
    "let us consider a diagonal as a 4-periodic billiard trajectory .        in general , a billiard trajectory that hits a corner can not be continuously extended , but if the angle is @xmath54 , such an extension is possible . indeed , an infinitesimally close parallel trajectory , entering an angle , makes two reflections and exits in the opposite direction , see figure [ corner ] .",
    "this holds both for the trajectories on the right and on the left of the ` dangerous ' trajectory that goes directly to the corner .",
    "this makes it possible to define reflection in a right angle as the direction reversal of the ray .    to conclude that the diagonals are equal , include a diagonal into a 1-parameter family of 4-periodic trajectories , interpolating between the two diagonals , and observe that these trajectories have the same perimeter lengths , see figure [ rectangle ] .",
    "we use a similar argument with the curvilinear quadrilateral @xmath47 made of confocal conics . the following porism implies ivory s lemma .",
