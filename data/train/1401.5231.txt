    "the crossover from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state of weakly bound fermi pairs to the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of molecular dimers and systems with reduced dimensionality are two of the most interesting topics in the ultracold atomic physics .    over the past several years",
    ", the predicted bcs - bec crossover @xcite has been observed by several experimental groups with @xmath0li and @xmath1k atoms @xcite . to study these systems",
    "it is necessary to confine them by suitable traps that , in the simplest case , act as harmonic potentials .",
    "even if harmonically trapped fermions are very dilute systems , their properties are governed by the interaction between particles .",
    "this interaction , in the dilute regime and at ultra low temperatures , can be characterized by a single parameter , the s - wave scattering length @xmath2 .",
    "experimentally , it is possible to control @xmath2 by using a magnetically tuned feshbach resonance .",
    "this can be described by a simple expression , see @xcite , that is @xmath3)$ ] with @xmath4 the so called background ( off - resonant ) s - wave scattering length , @xmath5 the magnetic field strength where the feshbach resonance occurs , and @xmath6 the resonance width .",
    "then , the feshbach resonance technique permits one to vary the magnitude and the sign of @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath2 is large and negative , the ground state is a bcs superfluid of weakly bound fermi pairs . for large and positive values of @xmath2 , instead , the bose - einstein condensation of molecules , associated to the formation of two - body bound states , is observed . in between these two states",
    ", there is a smooth crossover when @xmath2 changes its sign by passing through @xmath7 corresponding to @xmath8 at the resonance position ( see the above reported formula ) . at zero temperature and only in the case of dilute fermionic systems the only relevant dimensionless parameter in the description of the physical properties is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the fermi wave vector .    from the experimental point of view , it is possible to change the harmonic frequencies inducing a dimensional reduction of the system @xcite : from three dimensions ( 3d ) to one dimension ( 1d ) and from 3d to two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "the first case takes place with an external trapping realized by superimposing a strong harmonic confinement in the transverse radial plane to a generic shallow potential in the axial direction ( cigar - shaped configuration ) .",
    "the second circumstance occurs , instead , when the atoms are trapped by a strong harmonic potential in the axial direction plus a loose potential in the transverse plane ( disk - shaped configuration ) .",
    "both the effects of reduced dimensions @xcite and the transition from a dimensional regime to another have been carefully studied @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been suggested that a reduced dimensionality strongly modifies density profiles @xcite , collective modes @xcite and stability of mixtures @xcite .",
    "also sound velocities have been theoretically investigated in reduced dimensions for both normal @xcite and superfluid fermi gases @xcite .",
    "very recently , shanenko and co - workers have carried out an interesting analysis about bcs - bec crossover induced by quantum - size effects in the cigar - shaped configuration @xcite .",
    "both in the cigar - shaped case and in the disk - shaped one the dynamics is practically frozen in the directions where the harmonic trap has been generated . the idea is therefore to describe the system by eliminating the frozen spatial variables by performing a dimensional reduction process as done in @xcite .",
    "salasnich and co - workers have studied the problem by achieving an effective one ( two ) dimensional wave equation , that is a time - dependent 1d(2d ) nonpolynomial schrdinger equation , by integrating out the directions where the dynamics is blocked @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have studied the sound velocity for bose - condensed alkali - metal vapors .    for fermionic systems it would be , in principle , to follow a similar approach , i.e. to use a suitable generalization to the fermionic case of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , here , we study a confined zero - temperature two - component fermi gas both in cigar - shaped configuration and in the disk - shaped one by approaching the problem from another perspective .",
    "we perform the reductional dimensional process by starting from the popov lagrangian ( pl ) density @xcite .",
    "this lagrangian density- via the internal energy of the system - embeddies both the possibility to cross the boundary between the bcs side and the bec region of the crossover - by means of a polytropic state equation @xcite - and the effects of the quantum pressure by a gradient correction @xcite .",
    "for the density @xmath11 , appearing in the pl , we use an ansatz which consists in factorizing @xmath11 as a gaussian function @xcite in the radial ( axial ) directions times a generic function in the others . by employing this ansatz",
    "we obtain an effective lagrangian by integrating the pl density in the radial ( axial ) directions and write down the corresponding euler - lagrange equations ( eles ) .",
    "we assume that the system is in the stationary regime and suppose to create a perturbation - with respect to the equilibrium - sufficiently weak so to retain in the eles only the first - order perturbation terms .",
    "we then numerically determine the behavior of the sound velocity @xmath12 as a function of the equilibrium density in the cigar-(disk)- shaped configuration when @xmath13 ( bcs limit ) and when @xmath14 ( bec limit ) .",
    "note that on the bec side , due to formation of two - body molecular bound states ( see the above discussion ) , the binding energy @xmath15 of each molecular dimer ( @xmath16 being the mass of the fermions ) will contribute to the chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "the energy @xmath18 does not depend on the space so that it will not affect the properties of the system since , as we shall see in the following , in the ele corresponding to the equation of motion there are the spatial derivatives of @xmath17 .    for each of the two above cases , i.e. bcs limit and bec limit",
    ", we investigate the role played by the dimensionality in determining the atomic cloud properties .",
    "therefore we compare the above numerical solutions both with those pertaining to the three dimensional cases ( corresponding to the very large densities limit ) and pure 1d(2d ) case ( where the radial ( axial ) cloud width equal to the radial ( axial ) characteristic harmonic length ) . by this comparison ,",
    "we determine the density - range validity of our numerical solutions by pointing out these latter solutions describe both the extreme density regimes and the intermediate regions .",
    "we study a superfluid gas of @xmath19 fermions confined by an external three - dimensional potential @xmath20 at zero temperature .",
    "to do this we use the superfluid hydrodynamic popov lagrangian density @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath16 is the mass of the fermions and both the density @xmath11 and the phase @xmath22 depend on the position @xmath23 and time @xmath24 , that is @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the quantity @xmath27 represents the internal energy of the system that we write as a polytropic equation of the state plus a gradient correction which reproduces the effect of the quantum pressure , that is @xmath28 the parameter @xmath29 , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , varies within a specific range during the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "@xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) when @xmath32 ( bcs limit ) , while to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 with @xmath2 the s - wave scattering length ) when @xmath14 ( bec limit ) .",
    "the intensity of the gradient correction is controlled by the parameter @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "+ in the following , we consider two confinement configurations : the cigar - shaped configuration and the disk - shaped one .",
    "we assume that the trapping potential @xmath20 is given by the superposition of an isotropic harmonic confinement in the radial ( @xmath36 ) plane and a generic potential @xmath37 in the axial ( @xmath38 ) direction , so that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the trapping frequency in the @xmath36 plane .",
    "we make the hypothesis of a strong transverse harmonic confinement and a weak axial potential , so that it is possible to achieve a cigar - shaped configuration . due to the form ( [ cigar ] ) of the confining potential",
    ", we can perform on the density and phase the following ansatz @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and @xmath44 represents the width of the gas cloud in the @xmath45 and and @xmath46 directions . by using the ansatz ( [ cigaransatz ] ) at the right - hand side of eq.([lagrangiandensity ] ) and integrating the resulting lagrangian density in the transverse directions , i.e. @xmath47",
    ", we get the effective lagrangian @xmath48\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{\\alpha n_{1}^{\\gamma}}{\\gamma^{2}\\pi^{\\gamma-1}\\sigma^{2(\\gamma-1 ) } } -\\frac{\\lambda\\hbar^{2}}{8mn_{1}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial n_{1}}{\\partial z}\\right)^{2}\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{\\lambda\\hbar^{2}n_{1}}{2m\\sigma^{2}}\\left[1+\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\sigma}{\\partial z}\\right)^{2}\\right ] \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from this lagrangian we derive the euler - lagrange equations ( eles ) .",

    "this quantity can be viewed as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath24 and as a variational parameter as well . in the first case ,",
    "i.e. @xmath56 , we can start from the ele with respect to @xmath44 @xmath57 one , at this point , performs a sort of adiabatic approximation - i.e. one neglects the derivatives of @xmath44 with respect to space and time - from which one gets the following simple algebraic equation for @xmath44 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the transverse characteristic harmonic length .",
    "in the second case , i.e. when @xmath44 plays the role of a variational parameter , we have to minimize the action @xmath60 with respect to @xmath44 . by requiring therefore that @xmath61 we get the following equation : @xmath62 where @xmath63 . the eqs .",
