    "fig .  6 , large values of @xmath65 up to @xmath91 can be reached in scenario  a. the @xmath19@xmath20 interference effect in production is shifted to higher @xmath4 so that just for @xmath92  gev @xmath65 decreases from @xmath93 to @xmath94 for @xmath95  gev . for @xmath3  gev the @xmath19@xmath20 interference in the decay process is less important because for higher energies the characteristics of the production process is more and more dominating .",
