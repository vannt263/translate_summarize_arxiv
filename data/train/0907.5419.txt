    "on - chip communications , surface plasmon optics , and si photonics are all examples of _ planar optics _ , where the optical radiation is controllably guided on the plane of a photonic chip .",
    "a number of planar optical elements including lenses , mirrors , and on - chip waveguides , both plasmonic and dielectric have been recently designed , fabricated , and characterized@xcite . however , with a few exceptions@xcite , the majority of recent studies focuses on in - plane propagation of light and neglects out - of - plane scattering of radiation . in this work we analyze the out - of - plane light scattering and modal cross - talk due to effective index change inside planar waveguides and demonstrate that this scattering may substantially affect the propagation of confined modes in complex planar systems .",
    "we design a numerical approach to solve the problem of scattering and modal cross - talk in planar or quasi - planar structures that contain anisotropic elements , and present the technique to reduce or completely eliminate the scattering and cross - talk with anisotropic metamaterials@xcite .",
    "the problem of out - of - plane scattering has been of consistent interest to photonic community .",
    "although a number of finite - difference and finite - elements techniques , available today , can successfully solve the problem of scattering in relatively small geometries ( @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being free - space wavelength ) , analysis of wave propagation in an extended system is beyond the capabilities of methods that rely on finite - size meshing of space / time .",
    "one of the ways to reduce memory requirements to calculate the field in an extended structure with moderate number of scattering interfaces is to implement some sort of wave - matching technique where the modal spectrum is constructed to satisfy the solutions of maxwell s equations in the space , and only boundary conditions _ at scattering interfaces _ are enforced , resulting in calculations of _ amplitudes _ of the modes .",
    "effectively , modal expansion can replace the need to calculate all field components at every _ point of space _ with the need to calculate modal amplitudes in every _ region of space_.        one of the first descriptions of wave - matching approach and its applications for highly - conductive plasmonic guides can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite also describes scattering by planar guides with highly symmetric crossections .",
    "an approach to calculate to modal cross - talk and scattering in 1d guides was developed in refs.@xcite .",
    "scattering by periodically corrugated systems has been analyzed with rigorous coupled wave analysis ( rcwa ) in@xcite .",
    "recently , the generalization of field expansion to calculate scattering in plasmonic planar guides has been presented in@xcite . however , while the mode - matching calculations were proven to be highly efficient , the technique had failed in the proximity to plasmon resonance condition , when the field of a surface wave is highly confined to the proximity of metal interface . here",
    "we present a wave - matching technique that is capable of solving for wave scattering in complex systems formed by coupled planar waveguides .",
    "the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the mode structure of an arbitrary planar guide used in this work ( fig.[figgeom ] ) .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the development of mode - matching technique in quasi - planar system comprising a uniform in @xmath2-direction array of planar guides .",
    "the presented numerical approach is illustrated on examples of light propagation in several plasmonic and metamaterial systems in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 develops the formalism of truly planar photonics where out - of - plane scattering and modal cross - talk are not possible and presents an approach to design extremely - low - scattering plasmonic circuits .    in this work we use the following notations for the electric and magnetic fields in the system : the total electric @xmath3 and magnetic @xmath4 fields are shown in italic font ; the fields of modal components contributing to the total field are represented with symbols @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; the components of an individual mode in a particular layer of the multilayer stack are represented with calligraphic symbols @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we start from analysis of modal spectrum of a planar waveguide , schematically shown in fig.[figgeom](a ) .",
    "the structure comprises a set of @xmath9 planar layers with layer interfaces parallel to @xmath10 plane , with @xmath11 layer occupying the space between @xmath12 , and having ( uniaxial ) dielectric permittivity described by a diagonal tensor with diagonal components @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . in this section",
    "we consider the structure that is infinitely extended in the @xmath10 plane .",
    "the electromagnetic fields in this layered system can be represented as a set of transverse - electric ( te ) and transverse - magnetic ( tm ) polarized waves ( modes ) .",
    "each mode of the multilayer constitutes a solution of maxwell s equations that is finite for @xmath16@xcite . in homogeneous layered structure",
    "the mode can be parameterized by a combination of ( i ) its polarization ( te / tm ) , ( ii ) the in - plane components of the wavevector ( @xmath17 ) , and ( iii ) a set of layer - specific complex coefficients @xmath18 playing the role of amplitudes of the mode components :    @xmath19    where the fields and dispersion relations in each layer are described by : @xmath20    note that for a given mode only two of the amplitudes @xmath21 are independent of each other .",
    "indeed , the remaining amplitudes can be calculated using the well - known _ transfer matrix _",

    "layer - specific transfer matrices can be multiplied together , yielding the transfer - matrix relating the fields in any two layers of the multilayer stack , and thus solving the problem of reflection and transmission of a plane wave by the multilayer composite .",

    "the remaining groups of modes contain the continuum of waves , known as open - waveguide modes@xcite ( bulk modes ) .",
    "the first of these groups represents the modes originated by a plane wave that is incident on the layered structure from the top layer ( @xmath31 ) , while the second group represents the wave incident on the structure from the bottom layer ( @xmath32 ) . here",
    ", the modes of the first group ( `` top modes '' ) are parameterized by the real - valued @xmath33 in the top ( @xmath34 ) layer , while the `` bottom modes '' are parameterized by the real - valued @xmath35 in the bottom ( @xmath36 ) layer .    in the limit of symmetric distribution of permittivity @xmath37 ,",
    "the proposed here spectrum of top and bottom modes is equivalent to the proposed earlier@xcite combinations of `` standing wave '' modes with symmetric and anti - symmetric @xmath38-profiles .",
    "however , in contrast to the latter , the combination of top and bottom modes is more easily generalizable to the case of non - symmetric ( such as plasmonic ) planar guides . note that in majority of previous studies of plasmonic structures@xcite , bottom modes were explicitly omitted . as explained below",
    ", this omission becomes crucial in the regime of strong surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) scattering , e.g. in proximity to spp resonance or in plasmonic step geometry ( fig.[figsppscat ] ) .",

    "this assumption does not limit the applicability of the developed technique since due to translational symmetry , any solution of maxwell s equations in the coupled waveguide set can be represented as a linear combination of solutions for specific values of @xmath40 .",
    "likewise , we assume that excitation and response of the system are monochromatic @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "the linearity of maxwell s equations makes it possible to generalize the developed formalism for the arbitrary pulse excitation by representing the incident radiation by linear combination of monochromatic waves .",
    "note that in the process of calculating the waveguide modes , it may be necessary to determine the proper sign of the @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) component of the wavevector in a particular layer .",
    "if the component of the wavevector has complex value , this sign is determined from the requirement for the mode to be finite in its domain .",

    "we assume that the layers on both sides of the interface are aligned with each other ( @xmath105 ) .    in order to realize the efficient control over pulse propagation in the plane ,",
    "the two layered structures must ( i ) have the same number of guided modes , and ( ii ) provide the ability to independently control the index of the mode [ crucial for steering the light ] and modal profile [ crucial for optimizing the overlap integrals involved in @xmath106 and @xmath107 matrices ] .    as shown in ref.@xcite on the example of surface waves",
    ", these conditions can be satisfied when @xmath108 with @xmath109 being the constant number that does not depend on layer number @xmath110 .",
    "as can be explicitly verified , when eq.([eq2doptics ] ) is satisfied , all @xmath106 and @xmath107 matrices become diagonal .",
    "thus , the inter - mode coupling is absent across the interface .",
    "the interface remains completely transparent to te - polarized waves , while reflection and refraction of tm - polarized modes are controlled by the ratio of out - of - plane permittivities .",
    "the direction and amplitudes of the reflected and refracted modes are related to the direction and amplitude of the incident modes via the following snell s law : @xmath111 and fresnel coefficients : @xmath112 the above equations represent generalization of the formalism of ref.@xcite to multilayered guides .",
    "the concept of truly 2d optics is illustrated in fig.[fig2doptics ] on example of air - si - air system coupled to metamaterials waveguide . as expected ,",
    "reflection of a single mode in conventional planar system is accompanied not only by significant radiation scattering and modal cross - talk , but also by cross - polarization coupling .",
    "in contrast , for metamaterial guides the single incident mode excites one reflected wave , and one transmitted wave .",
    "an interesting extension of the truly planar optics is possible in plasmonic systems . from the fabricational standpoint ,",
    "it is highly desirable that the plasmonic circuit is fabricated on top of common metallic substrate .",
    "fabrication of extremely low - scattering plasmonic circuit is possible when using anisotropic dielectrics deposited on noble metals in the limit of visible and near - ir frequencies , where the permittivity of metal is much larger than the permittivity of dielectric ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "( color online ) anisotropic coatings ( b , d ) can significantly reduce ( and almost eliminate ) the scattering losses in plasmonic circuits ; the figure shows reflection , transmission , and scattering in conventional plasmonic circuit ( a ) ; field distribution for @xmath114 ( c ) clearly shows that only a fraction of the energy of incident spp is transferred into spp on the right - hand - side of the interface ; on the other hand , the interface between anisotropic system with @xmath115 allows for substantial modulation of spp index , and results in almost perfect spp - spp coupling across @xmath50 interface , width=302 ]    consider the situation where the in - plane ( @xmath10 ) component of permittivity of dielectric is kept constant across plasmonic system , and only out - of - plane ( @xmath116 ) component of permittivity of the superstrate is varied .",
    "in such a system the propagation constant of the plasmonic mode , approximately given by@xcite @xmath117 can be effectively controlled by changing the parameter @xmath118 .    in the same limit ,",
    "the exponential decay of the mode into the dielectric @xmath119 $ ] does not depend on its propagation constant .",
    "the only source of out - of - plane scattering in such a structure is related to a weak dependence of the field profile in metal @xmath120 $ ] on @xmath118 : @xmath121 .    as seen from fig.[figlowscat ] , anisotropy of dielectric superstrate , achievable , for example , with electrooptic effect@xcite , provides orders - of - magnitude suppression of out - of - plane scattering in plasmonic systems with respect to isotropic counterparts .",
    "to conclude , we have developed a reliable numerical technique for calculation of light propagation in planar guides and in arrays of planar guides .",
    "we have illustrated the developed formalism on examples of photonic , metamaterial , and plasmonic guides , and presented an approach to utilize anisotropic metamaterials for minimization and elimination of modal cross - talk in planar optical circuits .",
