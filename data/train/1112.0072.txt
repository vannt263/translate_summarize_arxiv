    "bessel , hankel and airy functions constitute some of the most important special functions used in theoretical physics , and their calculation is notoriously problematic for extreme ranges of argument and order , even if their mathematical definition is straightforward .",
    "especially , it should be noted that recurrence relations are useful for arrays of bessel or hankel functions when , for given argument , all functions up to a maximum order are needed .",
    "however , recurrence relations can not be used to good effect if an individual function of large argument and order needs to be evaluated .",
    "notably , bessel , hankel and airy functions occur in the multipole decompositions of various operators in electrodynamics ; these are known to be slowly convergent decompositions in many cases .",
    "a lot of work has been invested into the development of asymptotic expansions which may be used in the calculation of the special functions .",
    "after the famous paper of debye  @xcite , which used a saddle point expansion , a first treatise of the notoriously problematic case of equal order and argument appeared in ref .  @xcite . further historical papers , where the theory was refined , can be found in refs .",
    "the standard textbook  @xcite contains a collection of very useful formulas .",
    "the known asymptotic formulas for large order ( at fixed argument ) are given in reference volumes ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and they can be used , together with asymptotic formulas for other green functions  @xcite , for the calculation of the properties of bound electrons .",
    "indeed , bessel , hankel and airy functions belong to the most important special functions used in theoretical physics ; the much revived interest in these is also manifest in a recent monograph on airy functions  @xcite .",
    "the renewed interest in the theory of special functions is also manifest in a number of other recent books and review articles  @xcite .    in a marvelous _ tour de force",
    "_ , olver  @xcite has derived uniform asymptotic expansions which hold for large order of bessel and hankel functions , uniformly in the complex plane of the argument variable ( for arguments @xmath0 with a complex phase @xmath1 ) .",
    "the derivation is based on the general asymptotic properties of solutions of second - order differential equations .",
    "the findings are summarized in chapter  10 of the textbook  @xcite which is usually more accessible than the original references ( see also chapter  8 of the recent ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a central question surrounding the use of the uniform asymptotic expansions has been their practical applicability to the calculation of bessel and hankel functions .",
    "this question is important because the expansions , while uniformly applicable in the complex plane , have a complicated mathematical structure , and because they involve airy functions whose numerical evaluation is eventually required for arbitrary magnitude and complex phase of the argument . despite considerable and perhaps justified doubts regarding their usefulness for numerical calculations , the uniform asymptotic expansions  @xcite seem to be the most powerful ones available for the calculation of an individual bessel or hankel function of large argument and order .",
    "the aim of the current article is to show that their domain of usefulness can be drastically enhanced if they are combined with the `` principle of asymptotic overlap '' that makes it possible to join asymptotic regions for large argument with regions of small argument via the use of a nonlinear sequence transformation in overlapping regions [ see also section  2.4.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ] .",
    "the importance of the numerical evaluation of an individual bessel functions for physics is highlighted by the substantial work devoted to the development of asymptotic expansions and numerical algorithms  @xcite . if one aims to develop the algorithms based on the uniform asymptotic expansions  @xcite , one first needs to evaluate airy @xmath2 and @xmath3 functions . for large modulus of the argument and variable complex phase ,",
    "their behavior is characterized by a stokes phenomenon . along the stokes lines , i.e. , along specific values of the complex phase of the argument of the airy functions , the relative magnitude the contribution of the different saddle points changes .",
    "a numerical algorithm for the airy functions has been described in  @xcite .",
    "it relies on a separation into the region of large argument , where an asymptotic expansion is applied , and the region of small argument , where a differential equation is being integrated . here",
    ", we advocate the use of a nonlinear sequence transformation in order to bridge the gap between the asymptotic regime of large argument , and the regime of small argument where a power series can be used .",
    "the asymptotic expansion used for large argument has to be be adapted according to the complex phase of the argument . as a byproduct of our analysis",
    ", we derive some higher terms in the analytic expansion at the exact turning point @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first recall basic formulas in section  [ basic ] .",

    "the description of an implementation , including an example code , possibly with more refined termination criteria than those indicated in section  [ airy ] for the airy functions , would certainly be of value to the scientific community .",
    "secondly , in view of the considerations outlined below in appendix  [ appa ] , it seems feasible to construct an equally powerful algorithm based on an adaptation of the saddle point integration . in this case , considerable care needs to be vested into the turning point case @xmath187 as well .",

    "in this appendix , we explore alternative numerical procedures , with a special emphasis on numerical integration around saddle points . before we come to a discussion of the procedure involved , let us briefly review other , alternative approaches to the calculation of bessel and hankel functions which have been discussed in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been advocated to directly integrate the defining differential equation in suitable directions in the complex plane . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an analogous approach has been advocated for the calculation of airy functions . there is a further obvious problem at the turning point , where the argument @xmath0 and order @xmath8 of the bessel function are nearly equal . in this case , there are huge numerical cancellations in the calculation of the expansion coefficients that multiply the airy functions which are required in order to evaluate the uniform asymptotic expansions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been suggested to avoid using the expansion in inverse powers of the order of the bessel function in this case , and to use a convergent expansions in terms of a scaled complex argument @xmath50 of the special function .",
    "the procedure advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite is applicable to the transition region @xmath187 where @xmath227 , but can not be universally applied when @xmath50 is manifestly different from zero .",
    "another method  @xcite is to expand the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion into hyperasymptotics .",
    "yet , the asymptotic expansions of the coefficients of the asymptotic expansions ( sic ! ) are not applicable to all cases of interest and introduce another level of complexity into the problem .",
    "hadamard series expansions as an alternative to the uniform asymptotics ( still equal in limiting cases ) have been investigated in refs .",
    "finally , let us also mention that some special parameter cases of interest have received attention in the literature .",
    "for example , asymptotic expansions for bessel functions of the third kind of imaginary order have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    however , the preeminent issue in the formulation of possible alternative evaluation methods for bessel and hankel functions seems to be connected with a numerical integration about saddle points in the complex plane .",
    "expansions about the saddle points give rise to the above mentioned uniform asymptotic expansions  ,  , and  .",
    "in general , the evaluation of hankel , and bessel functions can be written in terms of two saddle points which dominate the paths of integration .",
    "expanding to second order about the saddle point , we obtain linear contours that approximate the paths of steepest descent and may be used in order to evaluate the functions , approximately .",
    "this approach , which has been advocated previously in @xcite and recently in @xcite , is appealing because of its relative simplicity .",
    "since the integrand of the integral defining @xmath228 is in general highly oscillating , the integration paths must be chosen with care . here , we describe a somewhat simplified approach ,",
    "in which one approximates the ideal path by a short linear segment crossing the saddle point .",
    "our treatment is similar to that in @xcite , however , we pay special attention to the case when argument and order of the bessel function are almost equal , which was not considered in @xcite .    in the case of equal argument and order , @xmath4 , the phenomenon of confluence of the two saddle points needs to be analyzed . for @xmath187 ,",
    "the two saddle points approach each other . for precise equality @xmath4 ,",
    "the two saddle points coalesce , and there are three paths of steepest descent , complemented by three paths of steepest ascent , about the saddle point .",
    "this leads to a more complicated situation with kinks in the contours of steepest descent , which must be used in order to evaluate the special functions .",
    "the investigations reported below are therefore of more general interest with respect to the numerical problems related to the confluence of the saddle points .          with @xmath233 here",
    "we have introduced the variable @xmath234 , which will prove convenient in the ensuing discussion . combining the two hankel functions to the bessel function @xmath235/2",
    "$ ] , we obtain from eq .   the integral representation for @xmath228 : @xmath236 the contour of integration is arbitrary .",
    "it can be deformed , nevertheless , to pass through the saddle point .",
    "finally , the bessel function of the second kind is obtained as @xmath237/(2\\ii ) = -\\ii \\ , [ h^{(1)}_\\nu ( z)-j_\\nu ( z)]$ ] .",
    "the definition is valid provided @xmath231 , to ensure convergence of the integrals .",
    "the identity @xmath238 is instrumental in deriving this condition .",
    "for @xmath239 , we apply the conversion formulas  .",
    "the case of purely imaginary @xmath240 requires another integral representation .",
    "we may use @xmath241 which expresses the bessel functions in terms of modified bessel functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for @xmath242 ,",
    "these have integral representations            we recall the definition of the integrand in the integral representation of the bessel function , @xmath245 expanded to second order about the saddle point @xmath246 , to be specified below , one obtains @xmath247 the method of numerical evaluation of the functions @xmath228 and @xmath248 amounts to finding approximations to the integrals , by quadrature .",
    "the starting point is to find the saddle points @xmath249 of the integrand in .",
    "they satisfy @xmath250 , and are given as      for @xmath252 , and the notation @xmath253 ( real @xmath254 , @xmath255 ) is introduced for later use .",
    "multiplying the arguments of the logarithms in eq .  , we see that the saddle points fulfill the relation @xmath256 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath257 ( and @xmath258 ) . for the case of equal",
    "argument and order , the two saddle point coalesce at the origin , @xmath259 the path of steepest descent ( psd ) is a path @xmath260 in the complex plane , passing through the saddle point , such that the imaginary part of the exponent @xmath261 is constant along this path .",
    "this means that the integrand @xmath262 does not oscillate .",
    "of course , there are further saddle points in the complex plane , described by the formula @xmath263 , @xmath65 integer , but these are not needed in our investigation .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the integrand @xmath262 decreases monotonically as we go along the path away from the saddle point .",
    "together , these properties make numerical quadrature along the psd easy . in",

    ", the asymptotic solutions are given by      a possible approach now is to solve eq .   numerically , and subsequently integrate along the numerically obtained psd @xcite .",
    "a helpful discussion of numerical aspects related to contour integrals in the complex plane is given in chapter  5 ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as we shall see , to obtain modest accuracy it is enough to integrate along a short linear segment @xmath276 , which approximates the true psd close to the saddle point .",
    "we have previously defined the saddle points @xmath277 ( @xmath278 ) and their real and imaginary parts @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "linear approximations to the paths of steepest descent in the complex @xmath260 plane are obtained as follows ,      where @xmath282 is real .",
    "that is , we parameterize the integral in ( similarly for the @xmath248 function ) as a function of @xmath283 as @xmath284 where the @xmath285 are line segments along the paths that define linear approximations to the contours of steepest descent , with @xmath286 .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath287 and @xmath288 are chosen so that a specific final accuracy is reached for the approximation to the integral .",
    "the sum in may run over one , or both of the saddle points @xmath249 , depending on the saddle point configuration .",
    "our expansion to second order about the saddle point ensures that no oscillations occur in the integrand up to this order .",
    "therefore , no imaginary part will be incurred in the integrand upon expansion about the saddle point to second order in @xmath289 . however , if one goes beyond second order , oscillations will occur upon using the linear approximation  .",

    "the coefficient @xmath282 is given by @xmath295 and the @xmath296 sign needs to be fixed .",

    ", the saddle point becomes a `` triple saddle point '' which instead of a cross formation has the shape of a double saddle point , or of a `` six - fold star '' with three paths of steepest descent , and three paths of steepest ascent in between .",
    "the corresponding term from eq .   in this case is @xmath305 because , for the confluence of the two saddle points , we have @xmath4 and @xmath306 . the saddle point equation thus simplifies and reads @xmath307 this has three solutions , @xmath308 where @xmath309 , and @xmath310 , and the last equality indicates that the confluent psds can be parameterized conveniently in terms of @xmath311 .",
