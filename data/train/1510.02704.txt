    "we introduce a non - spatial version of our model and compare it to other models known in the literature .",

    "with probability @xmath55 the process @xmath54 grows by @xmath60 individuals and @xmath56 grows by at most @xmath60 colonies .",

    "hence , @xmath54 dies out with probability 1 .",

    "when a catastrophe happens every individual in the colony has a probability @xmath37 of surviving and @xmath19 of dying , independently of each other .",
    "brockwell  @xcite has shown that survival ( i.e. at all times there is at least one individual in the colony ) has positive probability if and only if @xmath86 and @xmath87 hence , there is a critical value for @xmath37 , @xmath88 the single colony model survives if and only if @xmath89 . + next we introduce a non spatial version of our model and compare it to the catastrophe model above .",

    "when a colony collapses individuals in the colony survive with probability @xmath37 and die with probability @xmath19 independently of each other .",
    "every surviving individual founds a new colony which eventually collapses .",
    "colonies collapse independently of each other at rate @xmath85 .",
    "the proof in schinazi  @xcite may be adapted to show that survival has positive probability if and only if @xmath91>1,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 has a rate @xmath92 exponential distribution .",

    "it is also easy to see that the inequality can not hold if @xmath95 .",
    "hence , from now on we assume that @xmath96 after computing the expected value and solving for @xmath37 we get that survival is possible if and only if @xmath97 that is , when @xmath98 the model with multiple colonies has a critical value @xmath99 the multiple colonies model survives if and only if @xmath100 .    since @xmath101 for all @xmath102 we have that @xmath103 for any @xmath86 .",
    "hence , it is easier for the model with multiple colonies to survive than it is for the model with a single colony . that is , living in multiple smaller colonies is a better survival strategy than living in a single big colony .",
    "note that this conclusion was not obvious .",
    "the one colony model has a catastrophe rate of @xmath92 while the multiple colonies model has a catastrophe rate of @xmath104 if there are @xmath50 colonies .",
    "moreover , a catastrophe is more likely to wipe out a smaller colony than a larger one . on the other hand multiple colonies",
    "give multiple chances for survival and this turns out to be a critical advantage of the multiple colonies model over the single colony model .",
    "for @xmath23 being a @xmath20 process , we know that some colonization attempts will not succeed because the vertex on which the attempted colonization takes place is already occupied .",
