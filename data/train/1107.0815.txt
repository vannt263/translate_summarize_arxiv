    "<S> we discuss the effects of a trapping space - dependent potential on the critical dynamics of lattice gas models . scaling arguments provide a dynamic trap - size scaling framework to describe how critical dynamics develops in the large trap - size limit . </S>",
    "<S> we present numerical results for the relaxational dynamics of a two - dimensional lattice gas ( ising ) model in the presence of a harmonic trap , which support the dynamic trap - size scaling scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> statistical systems are generally inhomogeneous in nature , while homogeneous systems are often an ideal limit of experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> critical phenomena , characterized by the development of correlations with diverging length and time scales , are usually considered assuming homogeneous systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , the emergence of critical correlations is also observed in inhomogeneous systems . </S>",
    "<S> particularly interesting physical systems are interacting particles constrained within a limited region of space by an external potential . </S>",
    "<S> this is a common feature of the experimental realizations of bose - einstein condensations in diluted atomic vapors  @xcite and of optical lattices of cold atoms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental evidence  @xcite of a critical behavior has been reported for a three - dimensional trapped bose gas , observing an increasing correlation length compatible with a continuous transition , although the system is made inhomogeneous by the confining force . </S>",
    "<S> experimental evidences of finite-@xmath0 kosterlitz - thouless transitions  @xcite in two - dimensional trapped bose atomic gases have been provided in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the inhomogeneity due to the trapping potential is expected to strongly affects the phenomenology of continuous phase transitions observed in the absence of a trap . </S>",
    "<S> for example , correlation functions of the critical modes are not expected to develop a diverging length scale in a trap . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a theoretical description of the critical correlations in systems subject to confining potentials , and of how they unfold approaching the transition point , is of great importance for experimental investigations of the critical behavior of systems of trapped interacting particles .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a trapping potential @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are positive constants and @xmath4 is the _ trap size _ , coupled to the particle number . </S>",
    "<S> harmonic potentials , i.e. , @xmath5 , are usually realized in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the trapping potential is to effectively vary the local value of the chemical potential , so that the particles can not run away . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the case in which the system parameters , such as temperature , pressure and chemical potential , are tuned to values corresponding to the critical regime of the unconfined system . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behavior gets distorted by the trap , although it gives rise to universal effects in the large trap - size limit , controlled by the universality class of the phase transition of the unconfined system . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding scaling regime can be cast in the form of a trap - size scaling ( tss )  @xcite , resembling the finite - size scaling theory for homogeneous systems , but characterized by a further nontrivial _ </S>",

    "<S> we investigate how critical dynamics develop in trapped systems at thermal continuous transitions , i.e. , _ classical _ transition driven by thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the tss ansatz of @xcite , to allow for the time dependence of the critical modes , which depends on the static universality class , but also on the general features of the dynamics , analogously to homogeneous systems  @xcite .    in a standard scenario for a continuous transition , </S>",
    "<S> see , e.g. ,  @xcite , the critical behavior of a @xmath9-dimensional system is characterized by two relevant parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which may be associated with the temperature @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath12 , and the external field @xmath13 coupled to the order parameter , whose rg dimensions are @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a trap of size @xmath16 generally induces a further length scale @xmath17 , which must be taken into account to describe the critical correlations . within the tss framework  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> see also @xcite , the scaling law of the singular part of the free energy density around the center of the trap can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath6 is the _ trap exponent_. at the critical point @xmath19 , the tss of the correlation function of the order parameter @xmath20 is @xmath21 thus implying @xmath22 for its length scale . </S>",
    "<S> finite size effects , due to a finite volume @xmath23 , can be taken into account by adding a further dependence on @xmath24 in the above scaling ansatz  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the universal scaling behavior of the critical dynamics is essentially determined by the dynamic universality class , which depends on a few general properties of the dynamics , for example , whether there are conserved quantities during the time evolution ( see @xcite for a list of dynamic universality classes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling behavior of the correlation functions requires a further dynamic critical exponent @xmath25 , which provides the power - law relation between the critical time scale @xmath26 and the diverging correlation length @xmath27 , thus implying a diverging time scale at the critical point . </S>",

    "<S> analogous scaling behaviors have been put forward to describe the temperature and time dependence at @xmath33 quantum transitions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic tss ansatz can also be extended to take into account off - equilibrium dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to check the dynamic tss scenario , we consider the lattice gas model defined by the hamiltonian @xmath34 where the first sum runs over the nearest - neighbor sites of a square lattice , @xmath35 depending if the site is empty or occupied by the particles , @xmath36 is the chemical potential , and @xmath37 is the potential ( [ potential ] ) which vanishes at the center of the trap . far from the origin the potential diverges , thus the expectation value of the particle number tend to vanish , indeed @xmath38 $ ] at large distance from the center , and therefore the particles are trapped . the lattice gas model ( [ latticegas ] ) can be exactly mapped to a standard ising model , by replacing @xmath39 , obtaining @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in this picture </S>",
