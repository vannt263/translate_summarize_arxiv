    "first , the data in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] indicate that the gap closes beside the critical point , and the gap itself seems to be rather large .",
    "these confusing features are due to the infinitesimal ( scaled ) longitudinal magnetic field as mentioned in introduction .",
    "this infinitesimal magnetic field resolves the ground - state degeneracy , stabilizing the magnetic excitations @xcite .",
    "last , right at the critical point , the excitation hierarchy becomes smeared out .",
    "the smearing - out regime extends within a bound @xmath49 , which shrinks in the thermodynamic limit .      in this section ,",
    "we investigate the magnon - bound - state hierarchy . for that purpose ,",
    "we introduce the dynamical susceptibility @xmath51 with the perturbation operator @xmath52 and the projection operator @xmath53 . here , the symbols , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , denote the energy - resolution parameter and the ground - state energy ( vector ) , respectively .",
    "the dynamical susceptibility was calculated with the continued - fraction expansion @xcite .",
    "rather technically , the continued - fraction expansion requires the iteration sequences less than those of the lanczos diagonalization for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ; namely , at least for drawing the spectra such as fig .",
    "[ figure4]-[figure7 ] , the results converge rapidly possibly owing to the plausible choice of @xmath57 .",
    "the dynamical susceptibility obeys @xcite the scaling formula @xmath58 with a scaling function @xmath59 .",
    "afterward , the power - law singularity @xmath60 as well as the physical content of @xmath61 are considered .    in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , we present the scaling plot , @xmath62-@xmath63 , with fixed @xmath64 and @xmath65 for various @xmath66 ( dotted ) , @xmath44 ( solid ) , and @xmath46 ( dashed ) . the scaling parameters , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , are the same as those of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] collapse into a scaling function @xmath59 , eq .",
    "( [ scaling_formula ] ) , indicating that the simulation data already enter the scaling regime .    the peaks in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] reflect a universal character of the magnon excitations in proximity to the critical point ; see a schematic drawing , fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , as well .",
    "the peaks at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 correspond to the @xmath2 , @xmath74 @xcite , @xmath75 ( two - magnon - continuum threshold ) , @xmath76 @xcite , and @xmath77 excitations , respectively .",
    "the @xmath78-peak may be attributed to either a yet higher bound state @xmath79 or a composite particle made of @xmath74 and @xmath80 .",
    "it has to be mentioned that these excitations @xmath4 correspond to the glueball spectrum ( screening masses ) for the gauge field theory ( svetitsky - yaffe conjecture @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , according to the monte carlo simulation of the @xmath81 lattice gauge - field theory @xcite , there appear a variety of particles ( the so - called glueballs ) , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , quite reminiscent of the above - mentioned @xmath85 , respectively ; here we follow the notation of ref .",
    "our simulation result supports the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture at least up to @xmath77 .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "first , we consider the power - law singularity of @xmath86 , eq.([scaling_formula ] ) . by analogy to the random - walk translation distance , the singularity of the perturbation operator @xmath87 , eq .",
    "( [ perturbation1 ] ) , is counted as @xmath88 . on the one hand",
    ", the reciprocal energy gap should exhibit the singularity , @xmath89 .",
    "these formulas lead to @xmath90 . as a matter of fact",
    ", there also appears a non - trivial term @xmath91 ; this term is less singular than the above @xmath60 , and it was dropped in eq .",
    "( [ scaling_formula ] ) . here",
    ", a key ingredient is that an infinitesimal @xmath92-direction magnetic field @xmath93 is perpendicular to @xmath28 , and hence , the scaling dimension of @xmath93 is a half of @xmath28 .",
    "second , we make an overview of the dynamical susceptibilities appearing in literature .",
    "so far , there have been utilized two types of perturbations , namely , off - diagonal @xmath94 and diagonal @xmath95 ones , in the course of study for both @xmath6- and @xmath3-dimensional systems .",
    "the former @xmath96 was employed in refs . @xcite .",
    "our choice @xmath57 ( [ perturbation1 ] ) is based on these elaborated studies .",
    "we found that the duplicated operations @xmath97 create the @xmath98 particles more efficiently than a mere @xmath96 , at least , for the @xmath3-dimensional counterpart .",
    "the latter @xmath99 was implemented in refs .",
    "this choice leads to the ordinary uniform magnetic ac susceptibility , and it is of experimental significance .",
    "last , we mention the parameter setting of the peak - broadening factor @xmath54 . in this paper , aiming to avoid _ ad hoc _ adjustment of @xmath54 , we fixed the value of @xmath54 throughout the study . the continuum spectrum in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] seems to be well reproduced by this setting .      in the above section , through the probe @xmath100",
    ", we resolved the @xmath4 signals out of the two - magnon continuum . in this section",
    ", we examine the universality of each mass - gap ratio @xmath85 with respect to the variation of @xmath37 .    in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , we present the scaling plot , @xmath101-@xmath102 , with @xmath103 and @xmath65 for various values of the scaling argument , @xmath104 ( dashed ) , @xmath105 ( solid ) , and @xmath106 ( dotted ) ; here , the scaling parameters , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , are the same as those of fig . [ figure3 ] . note that the curves do not necessarily overlap , because the scaling argument @xmath107 is ranging ; see eq .",
    "( [ scaling_formula ] ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath74-peak heights do not coincide each other , whereas the peak position , @xmath13 @xcite , appears to be kept invariant with @xmath107 varied .",
    "our result supports the universality of @xmath13 @xcite , which has been established in the course of study @xcite .",
    "we turn to the analysis of the second - lowest bound state , @xmath108 . in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , we observe that the peak position @xmath108 is kept invariant with @xmath37 varied . in closer look ( @xmath103 ) , the peak positions read @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 for @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "namely , the condition @xmath112 is an optimal one in the sense that the peak position @xmath108 takes a stable ( extremal ) value @xmath113 our result agrees with the monte carlo result @xmath114 @xcite .    additionally , we are able to appreciate the universal intrinsic peak width for @xmath76",
    ". the @xmath76 particle may decay into a pair of @xmath2 , and eventually , the peak acquires a finite life time , namely , a reciprocal intrinsic peak width ; because the @xmath3-dimensional system is not integrable , it is natural that the spectral intensities are diffused @xcite . in fig .",

    "[ figure3 ] . in this scaling regime ,",
    "@xmath115 , the @xmath76 peak splits into two sub - peaks at @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the distance between these sub - peaks provides an indicator for the intrinsic peak width @xmath119 the peak width is smaller by one order of magnitude than the mass ( [ m3 ] ) , indicating that the @xmath76 particle is a stable collective mode , and it would be observable experimentally .",
    "we consider that the error margin for @xmath120 , eq .",
    "( [ m3 ] ) , would not exceed a half of this peak width ; namely , the uncertainty for @xmath120 , eq .",
    "( [ m3 ] ) , is bounded by @xmath121 .",
    "last , we consider the @xmath77 signal . from fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , we estimate the mass - gap ratio as @xmath122 . the peak position appears to drift , indicating that this peak consists of diffused intensities .",
    "in fact , there are a number of decay modes such as @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , giving rise to a considerably broadened line shape as to @xmath77 .",
    "further details are not fixed by the available result .",
    "we address a remark on the @xmath27-dependence of the spectrum .",
    "as mentioned above , the peak position takes a stable ( extremal ) value at an optimal condition @xmath112 . in a closer look",
    ", however , there are irregularities caused by the level crossing .",
    "a level - crossing point locates at the above - mentioned point @xmath115 , and another one occurs around @xmath126 , where the data of @xmath127 and @xmath46 are not very influenced . in this sense , these intermittent irregularities are due to the finite - size artifact , reflecting the fact that the bound state is embedded within the continuum .",
    "as mentioned above , the level crossing provides information how the spectral intensity is distributed over the discrete levels , and hence , it indicates the intrinsic peak width of the spectral peak concerned .",
    "nevertheless , apart from these intermittent irregularities , the peak position is kept invariant for a considerably wide range of @xmath27 , and the slight wavy deviation appears to be bounded by the above - mentioned error margin .      in this section , we investigate the dynamical susceptibility @xmath129 , eq .",
