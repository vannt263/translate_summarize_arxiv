    "the classical ground state solutions to skyrme s topological soliton model for baryons @xcite , with baryon number ( @xmath1 ) larger than 1 , have intriguing geometrical structure , with polyhedral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the simplest example is the system with @xmath2 , which has axial symmetry @xcite , in agreement with the description of the deuteron based on a quantum mechanical hamiltonian for the interacting two - nucleon system @xcite .",
    "simple rational map anstze , which provide remarkably accurate approximations to the classical ground state configurations , have been derived for several systems with baryon number larger than 1 @xcite .",
    "these rational maps represent formal generalizations of skyrme s hedgehog ansatz for the single baryon . here the rational map ansatz for the @xmath2 skyrmion is employed to carry out the canonical quantization of the @xmath2 solution , which represents the deuteron .",
    "the lagrangian density of the skyrme model is chirally symmetric under constant su(2)@xmath0su(2 ) transformations .",
    "the parameters of this symmetry group are treated as the collective dynamical coordinates in the quantization procedure .    the semiclassical quantization procedure developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the nucleon employs only that half of the parameters of full chiral symmetry group , which correspond to the diagonal subgroup , and therefore it describes only baryons with equal spin and isospin .",
    "the description by the su(2 ) skyrme model of such states , which have unequal spin and isospin as the deuteron , requires six dynamical variables in order to allow consideration of separate rotation of the generators of the su(2 ) group and the spatial vectors @xcite .    because the generators are irreducible tensors , these rotations are not independent , however , and therefore can not be not be used for canonical quantization . in the semiclassical quantization procedure the classical skyrmion is treated as a rigid body with the consequence that the quantum mechanical rotation contributes only positive terms to the energy functional .",
    "there is then no stable variational solution to the quantized hamiltonian . to obtain a stable variational quantized solution one may draw on the canonical quantization procedure , which has been developed by k.  fujii _ et al . _",

    "these energy of these quantum solitons depends on the dimension of the representation of the symmetry group in contrast to the semiclassical case  @xcite .",
    "the canonical quantization procedure developed below employs the two sets of three euler angles , which correspond to left and right chiral rotation groups as the six collective coordinates .",
    "the resulting canonical angular momentum operators lead to compact forms for both the lagrangian and hamiltonian of the biskyrmion .",
    "the two sets of independent angular momentum operators allow construction of the eigenstate of the biskyrmion from the eigenstates of two subsystems .",

    "the matter density of the quantum soliton falls off exponentially at long range in contrast to power law falloff of the classical solution .",
    "the inverse of the length scale of this exponential falloff for the @xmath6 skyrmion corresponds to the pion mass  @xcite . in the case of the deuteron",
    "it should correspond to @xmath7 , where @xmath1 is the binding energy and @xmath8 the nucleon mass .",
    "it is shown here numerically in the rational map approximation that for the variational ground state the matter density falls off at roughly this rate , as required .",
    "the approximate quantum soliton for the deuteron derived here describes the rotational quantum corrections appropriately , but not the large distance solution of two well separated single skyrmions .",
    "this is revealed by the magnitude of its radius and quadrupole moment , which are only about half as large as the corresponding empirical values .",
    "the semiclassical solution shares these features @xcite .",
