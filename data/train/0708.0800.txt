    "the analysis of elliptic flow becomes dominated by systematic uncertainties , mostly by inability to separate the so - called non - flow correlations ( azimuthal correlations not related to the orientation of the reaction plane ) and the effects of flow fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "flow fluctuations can be due to different reasons : one that has attracted much attention recently is the fluctuations in initial eccentricity of the participant zone .",
    "below we discuss only the flow fluctuations related to eccentricity fluctuations  @xcite . in this paper we review the definitions of the different coordinate systems relevant to flow analysis . then we discuss a particular model of eccentricity fluctuations . within this model",
    "we show that by studying azimuthal correlations of produced particles at midrapidity it is in principle impossible to separate non - flow correlations from flow fluctuations effects as all observables contain the same combination of the two effects .",
    "we call the coordinate system defined by the impact parameter and the beam direction the _ reaction plane _ coordinate system , and use subscript @xmath9 to denote quantities in this system ( see fig .  [ coordinates ] ) . then the orientation ( azimuth ) of the impact parameter vector in the laboratory frame is given by @xmath10 .",

    "the above two equations are derived in the approximation of @xmath64 but for gaussian fluctuations in @xmath55 the exact formula can be used . again , as @xmath34 can not be determined independently , @xmath60 is also undetermined .",
    "we find that in the gaussian ansatz , fitting @xmath17-distributions does not bring any more information than that provided by cumulants .",
    "it is not surprising - if the distribution is defined just by two parameters one can not get more than @xmath7 and @xmath3 already provided .",
    "note that under this ansatz all the higher order cumulant @xmath55 values are the same .",
    "the origin of the `` problem '' can be traced to the gaussian ansatz .",
    "it is known that for a gaussian distribution all the cumulants higher than rank two are zero .",
    "the latter means that if the collective fluctuations are of the gaussian type one can never prove that the fluctuations exist by any type of correlation analysis using only particles under consideration ( no external information ) .",
    "a similar problem was observed earlier in a temperature fluctuation study of many - particle transverse momentum correlations  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , deviations from a gaussian distribution might be too small to observe .",
    "such deviations would show up in the bad quality of the @xmath17-distribution fits based on the gaussian ansatz , or in a small differences between higher order cumulant @xmath55 values .",
    "the fact that all higher order cumulants are the same and determined by the value of flow in the reaction plane ( not the participant plane ) , and that that fitting of @xmath17-distribution yields the same value , explains the consistency between @xmath3 and @xmath65  @xcite , which is calculated with zdc - smd as event plane and is supposed to be sensitive to @xmath5 in the reaction plane , as well as the consistency between @xmath3 and @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a model of flow fluctuations in which flow fluctuates only in the impact parameter direction .",
    "the use of the detectors which measure spectator neutrons , advocated in  @xcite , is justified for that model , but would yield zero results for the case of fluctuations discussed in this paper .",
