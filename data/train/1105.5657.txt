    "typically , in a semiconductor excited by a single photon , the conversion efficiency of light energy into electrical energy is strongly limited by the fact that per photon only a single electron - hole pair ( or exciton ) can be created .",
    "for single - junction solar cells , this determines the well - known shockley - queisser limit.@xcite using multiple materials with different band gaps ( multi - junction cells ) , a larger part of the solar spectrum can be covered , and thus the conversion efficiency can be increased beyond this limit .",
    "another way is to use materials which exhibit the creation of multiple excitons per incident photon ( multiple - exciton generation - meg ) , thus increasing the quantum yield for incident photons with energies higher than twice the band gap .",
    "for this reason , carrier multiplication is currently the subject of intensive investigation in nanostructures such as graphene structures@xcite and semiconductor quantum dots ( qds).@xcite    most of the experimental investigations focus on the decay dynamics of the carrier population in the conduction band as a measure of meg : while an exciton decays radiatively on a time scale of tens to hundreds of picoseconds , multiexcitations can decay much faster ( on a picosecond time scale ) due to additional coulomb - mediated impact ionization and auger scattering channels .",
    "thus , the detection of different decay time constants in dependence on the incident light frequency is used as an indication and quantitative measure of meg .",
    "one disadvantage of these approaches is the ambiguity accompanying the discrimination of meg from other effects in quantum dots such as charged excitons.@xcite    corresponding to experimental investigations , theory has focused on calculations of ( multi-)exciton decay rates which were found to be crucial for meg and its efficiency in concrete material systems.@xcite the theoretical descriptions are typically restricted to bloch equations including phenomenological scattering rates as well as pseudo - potential approaches without quantum - kinetic time resolution of the carrier multiplication process .",
