    "consider the following second order equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 for all @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the forward difference operator defined by @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a solution @xmath25 of ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) is called a _ heteroclinic solution _ ( or _ heteroclinic orbit _ )",
    "if there exist @xmath26 , @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 are two equilibria of ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) and @xmath29    we are interested in the problem of the existence and multiplicity heteroclinic solutions of ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) .",
    "so far as we are aware , it is the first time in the literature for us to study heteroclinic orbits of difference equations .    equation ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) can be considered as a discrete analogue of the classical pendulum equation : @xmath30 the phase plane portrait of ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) with @xmath31 , shown on figure [ fig : de ] , can be compared to the phase plane portrait of ( [ ( 1.2 ) ] ) with @xmath32 , shown on figure [ fig : ode ] .",
    "the phase plane analysis of ( [ ( 1.2 ) ] ) shows the existence of two heteroclinic solutions for ( [ ( 1.2 ) ] ) joining @xmath33 and @xmath34 . on the other hand , the phase plane of ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) is similar to that of ( [ ( 1.2 ) ] ) . on figure",
    "[ fig : de ] , we use colors to distinguish between different orbits . nine ellipses represent nine periodic orbits , while two curves around nine ellipses are non - periodic orbits .",
    "close similarities observed on figures [ fig : de ] and [ fig : ode ] suggest the existence of heteroclinic orbits for ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) .",
    "our goal in this paper is to show that there indeed exist two heteroclinic solutions of ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) joining @xmath33 and @xmath34 also .",
    "let us now recall briefly the existence and multiplicity heteroclinic orbits for the following hamiltonian system @xmath35 which is a generalization form of ( [ ( 1.2 ) ] ) , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the past twenty years , many authors had studied the existence and multiplicity of heteroclinic solutions and heteroclinic chains for ( [ ( 1.3 ) ] ) .",
    "the first result in this area was proved in @xcite , where the author discussed ( [ ( 1.3 ) ] ) under assumptions : @xmath39 @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 , and @xmath43 @xmath44 is periodic in @xmath45 with the period @xmath46 , @xmath47",
    ". conditions @xmath41 and @xmath43 imply that @xmath44 has a global maximum on @xmath48 . without loss of generality , it is assumed that the global maximum of @xmath44 is 0 and put @xmath49 . under the non - degeneracy condition : @xmath50 @xmath51 consists only of isolated points , the following result was obtained in @xcite .",
    "* theorem a. * _ under assumptions @xmath52 , for every @xmath53 , there exist at least two heteroclinic orbits of ( [ ( 1.3 ) ] ) joining @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "at least one of these orbits emanates from @xmath54 and at least one terminates at @xmath54_.    let @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath40 . then ( [ ( 1.3 ) ] ) becomes ( [ ( 1.2 ) ] ) , and @xmath58 .",
    "theorem a guarantees at least two heteroclinic orbits of ( [ ( 1.2 ) ] ) through every point of @xmath51 .",
    "further development in this direction was done by felmer ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , who generalized the above result to first order spatially periodic hamiltonian systems . by using the saddle point theorem",
    ", the author obtained the existence of heteroclinic orbits joining two saddle type critical points . without imposing the non - degeneracy condition , caldiroli and jeanjean ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) studied conservative singular hamiltonian system without forcing term , and were able to establish the existence of heteroclinic orbits joining a global maximum point and a non - constant periodic solution .",
    "in the case when the potential is periodic and time reversible , by using minimization arguments , rabinowitz showed the existence of heteroclinic solutions between pairs of periodic solutions , ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . under the same assumptions , maxwell ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) proved that there exist heteroclinic chains connecting every pairs of periodic solutions .    for non - autonomous hamiltonian systems without forcing term , strobel ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) studied the existence of heteroclinic chains between pairs of equilibria . by using constrained minimization and comparison arguments , rabinowitz and zelati ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) studied ( [ ( 1.3 ) ] ) without forcing term , and found multiple heteroclinic chains joining pairs of equilibria .",
    "subsequent progress was done by bertotti and montecchiari ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , who generalized the results of strobel , by proving the existence of infinitely many heteroclinic solutions for a class of forced slowly oscillating hamiltonian system with potential @xmath59 of form @xmath60 , with @xmath61 being almost periodic in @xmath62 . next ,",
    "alessio , bertotti and montecchiari ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) obtained a generalization of the results of @xcite , in which @xmath63 is replaced by @xmath64 for @xmath8 small enough .",
    "however , without the non - degeneracy , these results are not as strong as those of strobel . in the case of forced slowly oscillating hamiltonian systems , rabinowitz ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) showed the existence of basic and even more complex heteroclinic orbits , without making any non - degeneracy assumption .",
    "then , zelati and rabinowitz ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) showed that there exist heteroclinic solutions joining two stationary points in different energy levels , which was established by using minimization arguments .",
    "we should also mention the work by chen and tzend ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , in which variational and penalization methods were being used to study the existence of heteroclinic orbits for the following system @xmath65 where @xmath44 is not periodic nor asymptotically periodic in @xmath62 . in those papers ,",
    "the authors obtained multiple heteroclinic orbits and chains joining pairs of equilibria as well as joining an equilibrium to a non - constant periodic solution .",
    "izydorek and janczewska ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) proved , without assuming periodicity or almost periodicity in @xmath62 of the potential , for ( [ ( 1.3 ) ] ) without forcing term , the existence of heteroclinic solutions joining pairs of equilibria .",
    "however , no results on the existence of heteroclinic solutions of difference equations have been proved . in this paper , by using variational arguments , we will study the existence and multiplicity of heteroclinic solutions for ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) . to this end , we need to choose a suitable functional space on which a variational functional , associated with ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) , can be constructed .",
    "however , lack of continuity assumption leads to some new problems which were not present in the case of differential systems .",
    "for example , for differential systems , if an orbit contains two points such that one of them is outside of @xmath66 , while the other belongs to inside of @xmath67(@xmath68 ) , then the orbit ( because of its continuity ) contains a point belonging to @xmath69 .",
    "however , such a statement is not valid for orbits of discrete systems .",
    "in this section , we study the existence and multiplicity of heteroclinic orbits of ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) joining every two adjacent points of @xmath70 . for simplicity",
    ", we make an image translation . by applying the substitution @xmath71 , ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath72 we look for heteroclinic orbits of ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) which join two adjacent points of @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 be the vector space of all convergent sequences @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 we define the space @xmath77 by @xmath78 and put @xmath79^\\frac{1}{2},\\qquad \\forall\\ y\\in h.\\label{norm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we have    [ 1 ] the bilinear product ( [ inner ] ) is an inner product on @xmath77 and the space @xmath77 equipped with the norm given by ( [ norm ] ) is a hilbert space .",
