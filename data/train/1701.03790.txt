    "it has been a long journey since the first clues of the discrepancy between our ideal picture , of a well behaved axisymmetric galactic disc , and observations were revealed . in this ideal scenario",
    "stellar orbits were approximately circular , the large scale non - axisymmetric structures ( spiral arms and bar ) had negligible effects on the dynamics , and a perfect correlation between age and metallicity of a star could be found for a given galactic region .",
    "some of the pioneering work noticing the discrepancy between the required characteristics for that ideal scenario and reality , comes with .",
    "he found in the solar neighbourhood a super metal - rich stellar population that exhibits the abundance of chemical elements and kinematics of the central regions of the galaxy ; since that time , a possible stellar migration that somehow was taking place in the galaxy was proposed .",
    "likewise , found a poor correlation between age and metallicity for stars in the solar neighbourhood from the thin disc .",
    "later on produced the first analysis of the relevance of stellar migration on the chemical properties of the galaxy ; by using the spread observed in the age metallicity relation and in the [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath1 [ fe / h ] relation for stars in the solar neighbourhood , the authors concluded that the observed spread can be explained by stars coming from different regions of the galaxy .    since this effect is not readily explained by plain orbital excursions on epicycles around their birth place ( * ? ? ? * hereafter sb02 ) , i.e. as an effect of simple heating by the large - scale galactic structures ( arms and bar ) , another mechanism was invoked : stellar migration .",
    "stellar migration , as defined by sb02 , is the redistribution of angular momentum for stars produced mainly by their interaction with the large scale non - axisymmetric structures of a galaxy .",
    "this process takes place mainly in the corotation resonance region of a given pattern and has the important characteristic of changing angular momentum of stellar orbits while keeping their orbital eccentricity unchanged .",
    "unlike simple dynamical heating ( that increases the orbital eccentricity ) , radial migration results untrackable since it is not expected to leave kinematic imprints on the spatial origin of the orbits .",
    "this would pose a challenge for chemical models because , with increasing flattening due to radial migration , the quantification of the past metallicity gradients ( of the stellar population of galaxies ) would become increasingly inaccurate .",
    "a lot of work has been devoted to this phenomenon since it was recognized in the 70s .",
    "the most recent papers on the subject refer to bars and/or spiral arms as the main mechanisms inducing radial migration . in the case of the spiral arms",
    ", stars close to the corotation region , particularly those with high angular momentum orbits , will suffer radial migration more efficiently due to resonant scatter ( e.g. sb02 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some of the proposals for the mechanisms to produce efficient radial migration ( as well as radial displacements ) are : fixed corotation long lived spiral arms , usually represented by simple analytical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; transient recurrent spiral arms that change the corotation resonance along large radial extensions of the discs @xcite ; bar and spiral arms resonance overlapping that induces a more efficient redistribution of angular momentum in the disc ; short - lived transient density peaks originated by interfering spiral patterns @xcite , and short - lived , recurrent grand design spirals @xcite .",
    "although the effect of stellar migration on chemical evolution in galaxies is still not quite clear , it is undeniable its impact on the shape of the milky way ( mw ) mdf @xcite .",
    "in particular @xcite stress the relevance of three factors that contribute to the relation between radial migration and chemical evolution : the strength of the bar or spiral arms ( the stronger the structures the larger the effects of radial migration and the larger the effects on the chemical evolution ) ; the duration of the radial migration ( the longer , the larger the effects ) ; and the slope of the metallicity curves for a given galaxy ( the steeper , the larger the effects ) . based on the results of the present work",
    ", we concur on the fact that the relation between dynamics ( radial migration ) and chemistry , depends on the particular galaxy under study .    in this work",
    "we have produced a comprehensive orbital study for the mw disc ; we employed a novel recipe of chemical tagging as well as an observationally motivated potential model for the mw , that includes the bar and a very detailed three dimensional density based spiral arms potential .",
    "our study has three purposes , the first one is to produce restrictions for the structural and dynamical parameters of both the bar and the spiral arms . the second , to provide a restriction to the abundance gradient of the disc ( at all times and radii ) , all based on an observable in our galaxy : the mdf .",
    "lastly , by considering plausible galactic parameters for the mw , we show that the chemical gradient is conserved at all times in the history of the galaxy , i.e. , neither radial migration nor heating remove the large scale chemical gradient of the mw galactic disc .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . the galactic model , initial conditions , and methodology",
    "are described in section [ model ] . a study on radial migration , radial heating and the theoretical mdf",
    "is presented on section [ results ] . in section",
    "[ tagging ] , we present the chemical curves and tagging recipe employed in this work .",
    "our best fit for the dynamical and structural parameters to the mw mdf is shown in section [ shape ] .",
    "restrictions to the chemical gradient in the inner and outer regions of the mw disc are in section [ constrain ] . in section [ stellardynamics ] , we show the studies of the dynamic effects of the spiral arms and bar imprinted on the mdf .",
    "we show the radial reach of migration and heating in section [ radialreach ] . in section [ maps ]",
    ", we present the resulting mdf for different mono - age stellar populations .",
    "finally , we present the discussion and conclusions , in sections [ discussion ] and [ conclusions ] , respectively .",
    "as already described in detail in @xcite , for this work we have employed an elaborate , three dimensional ( although stationary ) model , adjusted to the best of recent knowledge of the mw galaxy structural and dynamical parameters instead of employing the more sophisticated n - body simulations .",
    "n - body simulations are not applicable to achieving the goals of this work for the next reasons : a ) our model is completely adjustable ( contrary to n - body simulations ) ; b ) our model is considerably faster , adequate to statistical studies like the ones we are presenting in this work ; c ) because of its nature , this type of models allows us to study in great detail individual stellar orbital behaviour without the known resolution problems of n - body simulations .    the model is composed by an axisymmetric part and a non - axisymmetric part ( spiral arms and bar ) .",
    "the axisymmetric potential is based on the potential of @xcite , that consists of a disc , a spherical bulge , and a supermassive spherical halo .",
    "the spiral arms and the bar are introduced adiabatically by reducing the mass of the disc and the bulge respectively .",
    "the galactic potential is scaled to the sun s galactocentric distance , @xmath2 = 8.5 kpc , and the local rotation velocity , @xmath3 = 220 km s@xmath4 .    for the spiral arms we employ a model formed by a two - armed 3d density distribution made of individual inhomogeneous oblate spheroids , that we call the perlas model @xcite .",
    "the density is distributed as an exponential decline along the arms .    for the bar we have selected a triaxial inhomogeneous ellipsoid built as a the superposition of a large number of homogeneous ellipsoids to achieve a smooth density fall @xcite . for specific details on the construction and the fit to observations",
    "see @xcite .",
    "brief descriptions of the parameters employed in each simulation are presented across the paper .",
    "in a disc galaxy , stars orbiting the galactic center exchange angular momentum with non - axisymmetric substructure in the disc .",
    "the redistribution of angular momentum in the stellar orbits produces radial migration as well as radial heating , both displace stars from its current galactocentric radius and together encompass what is called radial mixing .",
    "even when radial migration does not leave a kinematical imprint in the stellar disc , the mechanism can impact some other observables because it can radially displace stars by several kiloparsecs .",
    "recently there has been found evidence of radial migration in the mw @xcite , confirming its ability of shaping the mdf @xcite .    in @xcite , by comparing three galactic models : one with a central bar , one with spiral arms , and one with bar + spiral arms , we found that the change in the skewness of the mdf is mainly driven by the spiral pattern .",
    "this means that , through radial migration , the spirals left an imprint in the metallicity distribution of the stellar disc .",
    "since a star preserves information of the state of the ism at its birth place and epoch , there is a correlation between the birth radius of a star and its metallicity . in order to study the extent of the stellar radial displacements due to radial migration ,",
    "in @xcite , we used the birth radius of a star as a proxy for its metallicity . as expected , the initial radii distributions exhibit a change in skewness when going from the inner to the outer disc .",
    "moreover , in the outer disc , we found that the spiral arms are the main responsible for shaping the initial radii distributions and hence , the mdfs .    by using the proxy of the birth radius for metallicity",
    ", we show how the shape of the mdf depends on the structural parameters of the spiral arms . in fig [ f1 ]",
    "we plot the initial radii distribution for two mw models ; as indicated in the figure , the models differ in the structural parameters of the spiral pattern ; here we can see the sensibility of the shape of the curves with the amplitude of the spirals and the location of the corotation radius .",
    "the purpose of comparing these two models is to show that the initial radii distributions ( and hence the mdf ) contains information about the structural parameters of the spiral arms .",
    "is the number of stars at a given initial radius and @xmath5 is the total number of stars that have ended within each coloured bin.,width=340 ]    although this proxy provides us insight about how the mdf would look like , in the next sections we complement our simulations with a chemical tagging in order to analyse and make a more systematic comparison of the simulated mdfs with those observed in the mw .",
    "the evolution of [ fe / h ] and star formation rate used in our simulations is obtained from a chemical evolution model for the galaxy by @xcite .",
    "this model was built to match three observational constraints along the galactic disc : the radial distributions of the surface density of both the total baryonic mass as well as the gas mass , and the o / h radial gradient from regions located between 6 and 11 kpc .",
    "the o / h gaseous values , determined from recombination lines by @xcite , were increased due to the correction by dust depletion @xcite .",
    "the main assumptions of the model are : a ) the mw disc was formed in an inside - out scenario from primordial accretion with time - scales @xmath6kpc@xmath7 gyr , where @xmath8 is the galactocentric distance ; b ) for each @xmath8 , a double - accretion scenario was assumed , that is , the halo was built with a timescale of @xmath9 gyr during the first gyr and then the disk formed with @xmath10 , till 13 gyr ( the present day ) ; c ) the star formation rate was similar to the kennicutt law @xcite , and its efficiency was five times higher during the halo - forming phase than during the disk - forming phase ; d ) the initial mass function of @xcite was applied in the @xmath11 m@xmath12 range ; e ) an array of metal - dependent stellar yields for he , c , n , o , fe , and , @xmath13 ( all heavy elements ) has been used , characterized mainly by stellar yields for massive stars that consider an intermediate mass - loss rate due to stellar winds ( see iwy model by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; f ) neither radial flows of gas nor radial migration of stars were considered ; g ) the chemical evolution model was computed for @xmath14 kpc , because the galactic bulge is located in the region @xmath15 kpc and its evolution is quite different to that of the galactic disc .    as by - products",
    ", the model reproduces very well : a ) the radial distribution of the stellar mass and the star formation rate ; b ) the c / h , n / h , o / h , n / o , c / o , and fe / h gradients ; and c ) the c / fe vs fe / h , o / fe vs fe / h , and c / o vs o / h trends shown by stars of different ages in the solar vicinity ( @xmath16 kpc ) @xcite .    in figure [ f2 ] we present the original output from the chemical model .",
    "the data are shown in an array of metallicity values for galactocentric distances between @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath8 @xmath18 @xmath19 kpc , going in time from 0 to 13 gyr ( present time ) , with a high temporal resolution .",
    "curves for the chemical evolution model of the mw .",
    "the color code traces the history of the galactic disc , from its formation to the present time ( 13 gyr ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    as mentioned before , it is uncommon that chemical evolution models provide information of the inner regions of the disc , this due to the lack of observational constraints as well as difficulties in modeling the gaseous component of the galactic bar and bulge .",
    "such incompleteness leads us to take an assumption for the chemical content of the inner disc , @xmath8",
    "@xmath20 @xmath17 kpc , as shown in figure [ f3 ] where an extrapolation towards the center provides us with a complete data set .",
    "let us anticipate that the extrapolation is not arbitrary , it is motivated by the mdfs themselves , as further explained in section [ constrain ] .",
    "also , while this is our initial hypothesis for the chemical gradient , the observed mdfs require a slightly flatter gradient , which we also explain in section [ constrain ] .",
    "curves extrapolated towards the inner 3 kpc .",
    "the color code traces the history of the galactic disc , from its formation to the present time ( 13 gyr).,width=340 ]    before proceeding with the tagging , another key ingredient provided by the chemical evolution model is the star formation rate ( sfr ) across the disc .",
    "figures [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] show the assumed sfr for the chemical model employed here .",
    "it is important to indicate that , as explained before , the original sfr within the model does not provide information for @xmath8 @xmath20 @xmath17 kpc , which means that we need to make a new assumption for the inner disc .",
    "figures [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] already show the extrapolation of the sfr towards the inner 3 kpc , which was performed as follows .",
    "the entire stellar content of the mw disc is a compendium of a large number of mono age populations ( maps ) , covering a very wide range of ages and birth places . because stars of different ages can coexist at the same epoch , the current distribution of stars in the disc depends on the distribution of individual maps , which in turn is dictated by the sfr at each epoch .",
    "this means that the present time stellar distribution depends on the sfr at all epochs . on the other hand",
    ", the mw model employed here assumes that the stellar distribution of the disc is well characterized by a miyamoto - nagai (",
    "m - n ) density profile , an assumption that works very well in reproducing key observables of the mw @xcite .",
    "these two previous arguments can be combined to give the main assumption employed here , i.e. , that a m - n density profile represents the current distribution of stars in the disc , and that this distribution is the result of the added contributions of the sfrs at all epochs .",
    "to fulfil this constraint , and in order to extrapolate the sfr to @xmath8 @xmath20 @xmath17 kpc , we took from the original data not only the sfr at a particular epoch but the sum of the sfrs at all epochs .",
    "next , we fit that sum to a m - n density profile in the center . in this way",
    "the fit of the sum give us a functional form that takes into account all the sfrs , and now this functional expression can be used to extrapolate , towards the center , the sfr at any time as shown in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "these two physically motivated extrapolations provide us with complete information about the chemical content ( figure [ f3 ] ) and sfr ( figure [ f5 ] ) of the mw stellar disc .",
    "now we can proceed with the chemical tagging of the particles in our simulations , which consists of the next steps .",
    "the simulation goes from 0 to 13 gyr and uses one map every 20 myr , for a total of 650 maps .",
    "the initial conditions for each map are constructed as follows : ( i ) by discretizing a m - n disc profile , ( ii ) the particle disc is placed inside the axisymmetric potential of the galactic model and , to avoid spurious transients , we evolve the system for 0.5 gyr while growing the bar and spirals adiabatically ; after which the system is relaxed with the background potential .",
    "( iii ) next , to add a map to the simulation we take a number of particles proportional to the sfr at every radius and at the epoch represented by each map , figure [ f5 ] .",
    "( iv ) finally , once we have the initial positions , velocities , and the correct number of stars for every map , each particle is assigned with the metallicity corresponding at its initial position ( birth radius ) and at that specific epoch ( figure [ f3 ] ) .    at the end",
    ", our simulations consist of @xmath21 stars , with ages between 0 and 13 gyr , a time in which they evolved dynamically within the galactic potential in the presence of the spiral arms and the bar .",
    "in section [ proxy ] we have shown how the shape of the initial radii distributions changes with variations of the spiral pattern s features , which lead us to anticipate that the mdfs will also depend on those parameters . by tagging the stars in the simulation with the correct metallicity , according to its birth place and epoch ,",
    "now we can show that the shape of the mdf contains information about the spiral arms .    from each one of our simulations",
    "we take a population of stars with ages between 4 and 4.2 gyr , and compute the mdfs at different radial bins . in figure [ f6 ]",
    "we compare the mdf of several galactic models that differ in the structural parameters of the spiral arms .",
    "top panel shows how the shape of the mdf depends on the scale radius of the spirals , i.e. , the mass concentration of the pattern . a less concentrated pattern means more arm s mass at outer radii , which in turn means that stars at those locations will experience a larger gravitational attraction during their encounters with the spirals . because in its orbital motion the acceleration towards the arms will be larger , less concentrated arms will induce a greater exchange of angular momentum and hence , a more significative radial migration . in the top panel of figure [ f6 ]",
    "we can see that the mdf is almost unaffected in the three inner radial bins . for the rest of the bins the distributions are wider and their peaks are lower for the less concentrated spirals , which means that the radial mixing is larger .",
    "notice that the radial mixing due to less concentrated arms can be so efficient that , for example , the mdf corresponding to the red bin ( @xmath22 kpc ) reverse its skweness compared to more concentrated spiral arms .",
    "also , for the yellow bin ( @xmath23 kpc ) , there is more migration of stars that come from the inner disc .",
    "this is reflected on a mdf with an inner tail of higher amplitude , which increases the asymmetry of the curve .",
    "the most important dynamical parameter inducing migration in the outer disc is the spiral arm pattern speed .",
    "this happens because the value of the pattern speed determines the position of the corotation radius , and radial migration occurs when the stars exchange angular momentum with the spiral arms around corotation .",
    "the second panel of figure [ f6 ] shows the comparison of two models that differ in the spiral pattern speed .",
    "when changing @xmath24 from 20 to 27.5 km s@xmath4 kpc@xmath4 the corotation radius moves from 10.9 to 8 kpc .",
    "the most affected mdf is the red one ( @xmath22 kpc ) , its skewness is reversed again and its inner tail raises , which means that this radial bin has more contribution of stars that come from the inner disc .",
    "the other mdf that changes significantly is the green one ( @xmath25 kpc ) , being shifted towards higher metallicities .",
    "the other important parameter of the spiral arms , that determines the amount of angular momentum that the pattern can exchange , is the pitch angle .",
    "an increase of the pitch angle increases the gravitational attraction of the spiral perturbation on the stars along their orbital direction . by accelerating stars along their rotational motion ,",
    "they gain or lose more angular momentum , moving to larger or smaller radii .",
    "the third panel of figure [ f6 ] shows the comparison of two models that differ in the pitch angle of the spiral arms . by changing slightly the pitch angle , from @xmath26 to @xmath27",
    ", we can see that the most affected mdfs are those of the two outer radial bins ( @xmath22 kpc and @xmath28 kpc ) .",
    "the inner tail for both distributions raises enough to see that these radial bins are getting more contribution of metal rich stars that were born at inner radii , increasing the skewness of the curves .",
    "finally , the bottom panel of figure [ f6 ] shows the differences in the mdfs when we change all those three important structural parameters of the spiral arms : scale radius , pattern speed , and pitch angle .",
    "the differences between both models are significant , showing that the shape of the mdf contains information about the spiral pattern as well as of the dynamical evolution of the stellar disc .",
    "as mentioned in section [ tagging ] , chemical evolution models for the mw disc do not include , in general , information within the inner 3 kpc .",
    "this is due to the difficulty to separate the different galactic components that overlap in the center of the galaxy , but also due to the lack of observational data to constrain a chemical model in the central region .    a common assumption to overcome this problem is to take the value of the chemical abundance at @xmath29 kpc , and assign it for all the inner region ( @xmath30 ) kpc ,",
    "i.e. , the metallicity gradient will be zero in the inner 3 kpc .",
    "although constant chemical content in the center of the galaxy is a first guess , it probably is not realistic . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", it is known that the stars can displace radially by several kpc , driving a chemical `` contamination '' at all galactocentric distances ( i.e. different abundances from those of the birth radius ) .    from our simulations",
    "we notice that the most inner radial bin considered ( @xmath31 kpc ) receives a significant number of stars born at @xmath30 kpc ( see for example fig .",
    "if all the stars born at @xmath30 kpc share the same metallicity ( zero metallicity gradient assumed ) , they would contaminate the stellar disc with the same metallicity when they displace to outer radii .",
    "this would be reflected in our two inner mdfs ( @xmath31 kpc and @xmath32 7 kpc ) by producing a huge spike at a specific [ fe / h ] value .",
    "this would produce unrealistic distribution curves that show us that assuming zero metallicity gradient in the inner disc is unsuitable .",
    "in other words , the assumed chemical content in the inner 3 kpc will have an important impact on the observables at @xmath33 kpc .",
    "here we propose a fit to the mdfs of the mw as a method to constrain the chemical evolution models toward the center of the disc .    noticing that close to the plane , the two inner mdfs reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) overlap , we tried to obtain similar mdfs from our simulations by changing the gradient of the chemistry curves , at r @xmath20 3 kpc , in order to avoid the unrealistic spike in the inner mdfs , tuning the gradient to obtain a similar degree of overlapping , as is observed .",
    "our best fit to the observed mdfs provide us a chemical curve along the entire disc that includes the prediction at inner radii in figure [ f3 ] .",
    "moreover , since the observed mdfs peak at high metallicities in the inner galaxy , then peak approximately at a solar value in the solar neighbourhood , and peak at lower metallicities in the outer disc , the observed mdfs also show the radial metallicity gradient across the disc , which puts additional constraints on our simulation . when using the chemical gradient as presented in figure [ f3 ] , we find that the stars lie between @xmath34 [ fe / h ] @xmath35 , while the vast majority of stars in the sample presented by @xcite have values of [ fe / h ] between @xmath36 and 0.5 .",
    "this suggests that the actual chemical gradient of the mw is slightly flatter than the @xmath37 dex kpc@xmath4 presented in figure [ f3 ] . by flattening the chemical gradient by 22% to @xmath38 dex kpc@xmath4",
    ", we reproduce the range observed by hayden et al .",
    "this means that , by confining the peaks of the simulated mdfs to the reported values , we improve the chemical evolution model via the restriction of the radial gradient across the disc .",
    "figure [ f7 ] shows the final chemical model obtained by ( i ) extrapolating the chemical content towards the inner disc ( in order to overlap the two inner mdfs , without the unrealistic spike ) , and ( ii ) confining of the mdf peaks between @xmath39 [ fe / h ] @xmath40 .",

    "the color code traces the history of the galactic disc , from its formation to the present time ( at 13 gyr).,width=340 ]",
    "in this work we propose an analysis of the mdfs as a method to obtain information on the structure and dynamics that shape the spiral arms and bar of galaxies .",
    "we apply this to the milky way , where the mdfs have been observed in great detail .",
    "as we have mentioned , the interactions of the stars with the non - axisymmetric structures in the disc can modify the stellar orbits either by heating or by radial migration .",
    "heating occurs when the orbital eccentricity increases , and can be quantified directly from the kinematics of the stars ; in this case , the velocity dispersion can provide a good idea of the dynamical evolution of a given star field ; e.g. it is known that the age and velocity dispersion of stars are correlated @xcite . on the other hand , when migration takes place the mean galactocentric distance of the star changes significantly , but its orbital eccentricity does not ; this means that , unlike with heating , migration can not be revealed through stellar kinematics ; instead , recent observations and numerical simulations have shown that this dynamical process can be revealed through the mdfs .",
    "since the shapes of the mdfs measure displacements of stars away form their birth radius , they capture both processes , heating as well as migration .",
    "we argue that the shape of the mdf not only tells us whether the stellar disc experienced migration , but also contains specific information about the structure that triggered such migration .",
    "we have come up with this conclusion by ( i ) finding that the spiral arms are the ones that determine the sign in the skweness of the mdfs @xcite , and ( ii ) showing how the shapes of the mdfs are sensitive to the structural parameters of the spiral pattern ( see section [ shape ] ) .    in figure [ f8 ]",

    "we can see in more detail the extended tails that appear in the mdfs from previous figures ; for instance , at the inner radial bins the peak in density of stars is not centered in the middle of the orange band , but a little shifted to the top ; on the other hand , in the outer radial bins , the peak in density is located at low metallicities , near the bottom of the orange band , with an important number of stars at high metallicities .",
    "also , while the mdf tells us the radial bin to which the star belongs , the [ fe / h ] @xmath1 @xmath8 plane provides its exact location within the bin .",
    "for example , stars with high metallicity that were born at the inner disc but now are located in the outer radial bin ( @xmath28 kpc ) did not migrate to only reach the inner boundary of that bin , but as figure [ f9 ] shows , they migrated also to the outer boundary of the bin .     vs. radius corresponding to the same simulation of figure [ f8 ] .",

    "in the previous sections we have seen how the presence of spiral arms or a bar in a disc galaxy displace stars radially , with an important fraction of them being moved away from their birth radius .",
    "as already mentioned , the displacements occur because the stars gain or loose angular momentum when interacting with the pattern ( spirals or bar ) .",
    "for example , in the case of spiral arms , a star can be orbitating either in front of the pattern or behind it .",
    "if the star is ahead of the arm , the overdensity of the pattern will pull the star backwards , diminishing its angular momentum , which will cause the star to move to inner radii .",
    "similarly , if the star is located behind the pattern , it will be pulled forward , which increases its angular momentum , moving the star to larger radii .",
    "these two scenarios mean that , at any given radius , the spirals or the bar can induce radial displacements in both directions .    in this section",

    "meanwhile for @xmath58 kpc the trend is that , in average , the stars were born at inner radii , and were displaced outwards to their current position .    in the particular case of the solar circle ( @xmath59 kpc ) the average displacement is @xmath60 kpc",
    "however , this value is just the average , and the fraction of stars that were born at radii considerably smaller and end up at the solar radius can be important .",

    "up to this point we have shown how the mdf looks for a given map , or more precisely , for stars within a narrow age range .",
    "for example , the mdfs in figure [ f8 ] reveal a metallicity gradient across the disc , with long extended tails producing asymmetric curves , and with peak metallicity values constrained between @xmath39 [ fe / h ] @xmath40 .",
    "but how do they look like for younger or older stars ?",
    "i.e. , how are the mdfs be for different maps ?    as described above , our simulations are an extensive compendium of mono - age populations , with number of stars and distribution across the disc given by the sfr at their birth epoch .",
    "also , as we applied a chemical tagging according to the data in figure [ f7 ] , we can compute the mdfs for any age .",
    "figure [ f12 ] shows the mdfs for three maps in the simulation , going from very young to very old stars . in the top panel , for the youngest stars ,",
    "the mdfs are narrow with high amplitude , meaning that , for most of the stars , the metallicity is the one expected at that radial position . in other words , this is an indication that the current galactocentric distance of the star is not very different from its birth radius .    in the middle panel of figure [ f12 ] , for stars of intermediate age ,",
    "the mdfs are clearly different from the previous case , specially for the outer radial bins .",
    "first notice that , as a consequence of the lower metal content of the disc at earlier epochs , all the curves are shifted toward lower values of [ fe / h ] .",
    "they are wider , have decreased in amplitude , and the asymmetry is more evident .",
    "these features are the signatures of an effective radial mixing of the stellar disc , particularly one driven by radial migration , that we know now is the responsible for the extended tails and opposite skewness ( when going from the inner to the outer disc ) in the mdfs .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ f12 ] shows the mdfs for very old stars . as in the previous case ,",
    "the curves are shifted toward even lower values of [ fe / h ] ; the curves have smaller amplitudes and are wider compared to the previous cases .",
    "note how for the inner radial bins , the internal tail of the curve extends toward low metallicities , while for the outer radial bins , the external tail of the curves extends toward large metallicity values .",

    ", width=340 ]    one thing in common for the sets of mdfs presented in figure [ f12 ] is that , in spite of a clear mixing , the metallicity gradient is preserved for the three of them .",
    "this point is important because it tells us the stellar disc can experience significant radial migration while preserving a clear metallicity gradient .",
    "this means that one should not expect that radial migration is for sure able to erase a strong metallicity gradient .",
    "this last point is also clear by plotting the same maps in the [ fe / h ] vs. @xmath8 plane , as shown in figure [ f13 ] .",
    "the stellar density at every radius shows a global metallicity gradient across the disc .",
    "also , the width of the orange bands in the metallicity distribution is directly correlated to the age of every map .",
    "it is narrow for the youngest population , while it is wider for the sample of older stars , indicating a system more dynamically evolved , and hence , a more mixed population .",
    "thorogout this work , we have developed some ideas we consider relevant that we would like to highlight next .",
    "radial migration can produce an important effect in a galaxy and yet not be noticed with simple diagnostics such as a single abundance curve .",
    "indeed , in spite of the fact that radial mixing is a global and general effect in disc galaxies , erasing the global metallicity gradient of a given galaxy requires powerful non - axisymmetric features in the disc ; this does not seem to be the case for the mw , as deduced from a more suitable diagnostic to measure the impact of radial migration in the mw , like the mdfs .",
    "the mdfs seem to be a key observable to understand the radial migration effect in the mw , which in turn allows us to understand better the morphology of our galaxy . with an extensive set of detailed orbital simulations specifically adjusted to the mw",
    ", we conclude that the existence of a metallicity gradient in a given galaxy , does not rule out the presence of important radial mixing .",
    "also , radial mixing in the external part of the galaxy , is mainly due to the spiral arms and not to the bar ; this means that similar spiral arms in a galaxy , would produce similar abundance curves and mdfs specifically towards the outskirts of the galaxy , independently of the existence of a bar .",
    "we find that the corotation resonance is able to produce a local flattening ( around it ) in the metallicity global curve ( see figures [ f9 ] and [ f13 ] ) .    in order to reproduce the galactic mdfs observed by @xcite ,",
    "our simulations need 22@xmath73 flatter fe / h gradients during the last 5 gyr of the evolution than the gradients predicted by the chemical evolution model ( between 8 and 13 gyr ) of @xcite .",
    "the current fe / h slope predicted by the chemical evolution model is @xmath37 dex kpc@xmath4 and its 22@xmath73-reduced slope is @xmath38 , for the gaseous component ; for the stellar component , this becomes @xmath74 , which perfectly agrees with the fe / h gradient from cepheids ( @xmath75 dex kpc@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the 4 - 16 kpc range ( however this work studies younger stars than the ones observed in the mdf apogee sample ) .",
    "the value of the reduced slope remains constant during the last 4.5 gyr of the evolution , particularly in the 6 - 20 kpc range ( see fig . 5 by * ? ? ?",

    "/ h gradient implies a flatter o / h gradient by a similar proportion @xcite . as mentioned in section",
    "[ tagging ] , the chemical evolution model was built to reproduce the o / h gradient in the galactic disc .",
    "the predicted o / h slope is equal to @xmath76 dex kpc@xmath4 and its 22@xmath73-reduced slope is @xmath77 dex kpc@xmath4 which is consistent with the @xmath78 dex kpc@xmath4 value of @xcite , as well as with the o / h slope ( @xmath79 dex kpc@xmath4 ) by @xcite , when ngc 2579 , an hii region at @xmath80 kpc , was added to the sample of @xcite . in the chemical evolution model by @xcite , a flatter o / h gradient",
    "can be obtained modifying the accretion rate ; mainly , assuming a less intense inside - out scenario , i.e. , taking into account a @xmath10 less dependent on @xmath8 , which does not affect the agreement with all chemical properties mentioned in section [ tagging ] .",
    "finally , we would like to emphazise that , although in our first attempt to fit the mdfs @xcite , we utilised plain stellar birth radius as a proxy for metallicity ( i.e. without a recipe for the chemical abundance distribution ) , we were able to closely approximate the mdf shapes , qualitatively speaking .",
    "however , it was not possible to fit the absolute magnitudes nor the width of the mdf ; this is only possible with a combination between both approaches , dynamics and chemistry . nonetheless , comparing qualitatively the mdf shapes constructed by using only the birth radius of the stars",
    ", we can see that the main factors that sculpt the mdfs in the outskirts of the galaxy are the specific spiral arms morphology and dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial metallicity gradient plays a fundamental role in the resulting shape of the inner mdfs , and becomes the main factor , even more important than the dynamical effect of the bar .",
    "with a suitable combination of a detailed observationally motivated model of the milky way galactic potential , that includes spiral arms and bar , and a careful recipe to approximate the chemical evolution , we have performed an extensive set of chemodynamical simulations to study the history of the metallicity distribution function in the galaxy .",
    "even when , in dynamical terms , radial migration does not leave a kinematical imprint in the stellar disc , the impact of the mechanism can be discerned from other observables , such as the metallicity distribution of the stellar disc .    by comparing the mdfs obtained from a set of galactic models , by swapping their morphological and dynamical parameters , we show the sensitivity of the mdf shapes .",
    "this means that the shape of the mdf contains information of the spiral pattern as well as of the stellar disc dynamical evolution . in this work",
    "we provide the characteristics of the spiral arms that better fit the mdf shapes ( table [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "also , by tuning our simulated mdfs as close as possible to the observed ones , we introduce a method to set further constrains to chemical evolution models .",
    "this is helpful along the whole disk , but specially in the central region , where currently models do not provide information about the chemical content and its evolution .",
    "we have quantified the reach of radial migration in moving stars away from their birth radius .",
    "for example , a considerable number of stars currently located at the solar circle were born at much smaller galactocentric distances . by inducing such extended radial excursions",
    ", migration explains how some stars exhibit a chemical content that does not correspond with the current location of a such star . in this manner ,",
    "migration , mainly due to the spiral pattern , models the metallicity distribution across the disc , imprinting its morphology and dynamics on the mdfs .",
    "we found that a dynamically evolved stellar population can exhibit a clear metallicity gradient regardless of the presence of important radial migration and heating in the disc .",
    "this means that the presence of important radial migration does not imply necessarily a flattening of the metallicity gradient .",
    "therefore , looking for flattened metallicity gradients is not a trustworthy method to establish the presence and importance of radial migration in galaxies .    by fitting the separation of the mdfs of the five radial bins presented by apogee",
