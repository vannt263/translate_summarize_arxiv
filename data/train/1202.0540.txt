    "* the geodesic structure of plane wave spacetimes is understood essentially in its entirety .",
    "this allows @xmath0 and @xmath28 to be computed explicitly .",
    "most importantly , we choose to work in plane wave spacetimes due to the existence of a procedure known as the penrose limit @xcite .",
    "this provides a sense in which the geometry near any given null geodesic in an arbitrary spacetime looks like the geometry of an appropriate plane wave spacetime .",
    "the penrose limit preserves various properties of the original spacetime @xcite ; in particular , the conjugate point structure of the chosen ( or `` reference '' ) geodesic .",
    "we use penrose limits to argue that most of the `` leading order '' singular behavior of green functions associated with wave propagation in _ arbitrary _ spacetimes may be understood using knowledge of green functions in appropriate plane wave spacetimes .",
    "this singular structure naturally splits into two components .",
    "one portion is associated with the appearance of conjugate points on the reference geodesic with which the penrose limit is performed .",
    "the effects of such points are , in a sense , determined quasi - locally .",
    "they affect green functions near the reference geodesic in a way that depends only on their multiplicities .",
    "furthermore , the effects of conjugate points propagate into their future along the reference geodesic . in most cases ,",
    "the singular structures that result from the appearance of conjugate points have either the 4- or 2-fold patterns or . there do , however , exist finely - tuned examples that fall into neither category because there are a mixture of astigmatic and anastigmatic caustics .",
    "it is important to emphasize that despite this result , green functions are not quasi - local objects . in general , it is not possible for all of a green function s singular structure to be determined near some null geodesic using only knowledge of the geometry near that geodesic .",
    "`` nonlocal singularities '' can be introduced near a reference geodesic when non - conjugate pairs of points on that geodesic are also connected by other null geodesics with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "they are locally flat , and therefore admit no conjugate points along any geodesic .",
    "cosmic string spacetimes do , however , possess an angular defect ( if @xmath41 ) that forces some pairs of points on opposite sides of the string to be connected by more than one geodesic . ] .",
    "we show that the effects of such intersections on a green function are `` non - propagating . ''",
    "there is sense in which their associated singularities are confined to regions near the intersection points . using the penrose limit , singularities of this type correspond to isolated structures in plane wave green functions occurring at locations which can not be predicted from",
    "any given set of initial data .",
    "plane wave spacetimes are not globally hyperbolic , so their green functions can not be uniquely specified in terms of any initial data set .",

    "such singularities appear quite different from those associated with @xmath585 .",
    "there is a sense in which they are `` frozen '' at specific affine times on the reference geodesic .",
    "we now discuss some consequences of the above results .",
    "general statements are made regarding green functions associated with conformally - flat spacetimes and an important class of vacuum spacetimes .",
    "some more specific examples are also mentioned briefly .",
    "the simplest general statement following from the argument of sect .",
    "[ sect : genericgreen ] concerns scalar green functions in spacetimes whose metrics are conformally flat .",
    "as noted above , all penrose limits of conformally - flat spacetimes are conformally - flat plane waves .",
    "furthermore , all conformally - flat plane waves have metrics @xmath5 with the form .",
    "it is evident from this together with and - that all conjugate points in such spacetimes have multiplicity 2 .",
    "the plane wave green function @xmath585 is therefore given by .",
    "via , a similar structure also appears in the green function @xmath675 associated with the full spacetime @xmath601 .",
    "this provides the sense in which the 2-fold singular structure is present in retarded scalar green functions associated with all conformally - flat spacetimes .    for null geodesics passing through a vacuum ( ricci - flat ) region of some spacetime @xmath600 ,",
    "the associated penrose limit is a vacuum plane wave with the metric .",
    "the wave profile in such a case satisfies @xmath702 if @xmath703 for some constant matrix @xmath704 , the resulting plane wave is said to be linearly polarized .",
    "an appropriate rotation of the spatial components @xmath705 of the tetrad used to perform the penrose limit can then be used to set @xmath706 it follows that the @xmath109 appearing in can be identified ( up to a sign ) with the @xmath105 in . if @xmath109 is either entirely non - negative or entirely non - positive , it is clear from - that any conjugate points which may exist must have multiplicity 1 .",
    "@xmath585 then has the form .",
    "it follows from that in the vacuum case where the riemann tensor along the reference geodesic has the form and the @xmath109 appearing in that equation does not pass through zero ( but may sometimes equal zero ) , @xmath675 contains the repeating 4-fold pattern of singular structures .",
    "many of the explicit computations of four - dimensional green functions found in the literature fall into one of the two classes of spacetimes just described . in the conformally - flat case ,",
    "scalar green functions have been computed in both the einstein static universe and bertotti - robinson spacetimes @xcite .",
    "as expected from our argument using penrose limits , the singular structures of retarded green functions associated with both of these spacetimes have been found to have a 2-fold pattern with the form .",
    "another important example in the literature is the retarded scalar green function associated with schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "all penrose limits of schwarzschild have the form with @xmath707 @xcite .",
    "we therefore predict that retarded green functions in schwarzschild possess the 4-fold singular structure .",
    "this is indeed what was observed in the explicit computations carried out in @xcite .",
    "more generally , we may consider scalar green functions associated with all kerr spacetimes .",
    "penrose limits of kerr ( and all other petrov type d spacetimes ) are discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is easily shown from this that penrose limits of kerr result in wave profiles with the form . for a reference geodesic with specific angular momentum @xmath708 about the symmetry axis and carter constant @xmath709 ,",
    "it is shown in @xcite that @xmath710 } { [ r^2(u ) + a^2 \\cos^2 \\theta(u)]^{5/2 } } .\\ ] ] here , @xmath51 and @xmath711 are the mass and angular momentum associated with the kerr background . @xmath712 and @xmath713 are the boyer - lindquist coordinates of the reference geodesic at the affine time @xmath72 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath109 can not change sign , so we predict that retarded scalar green functions in kerr spacetime contain the 4-fold singular structure .",
    "thus far , we have considered only green functions associated with the propagation of scalar fields .",
    "it is straightforward to partially extend our results to also allow for fields with nonzero tensor rank . in particular , we now show that the leading order singular structure of tensor green functions in arbitrary spacetimes can be understood using appropriate plane wave green functions .",
    "no attempt is made , however , to also derive the form of those plane wave green functions as we have done in the scalar case .",
    "as an example , consider a field @xmath714 propagating on a spacetime @xmath601 and satisfying @xmath715 here @xmath646 is any second - order linear differential operator whose principal part is equal to the dalembertian @xmath647 .",
    "the wave equation is naturally associated with green functions @xmath716 satisfying @xmath717 for all smooth vector fields @xmath718 with compact support .    now choose a point @xmath672 and consider the behavior of @xmath719 near a null geodesic @xmath598 passing through @xmath673 .",
    "as above , we choose a tetrad and construct a fermi - like coordinate system @xmath653 in a neighborhood of @xmath598 .",
    "it is also useful to consider the scaled coordinates @xmath119 defined by .",
    "we now seek an analog of .",
    "this requires choosing an appropriate family of test functions similar to .",
    "given an arbitrary test function @xmath720 in the plane wave spacetime which results from the penrose limit of @xmath601 and @xmath598 , reverse the coordinate transformation to obtain    @xmath721    in the unscaled coordinates @xmath653 .",
    "similarly , choose some covector @xmath722 which remains fixed ( for all @xmath723 ) in the scaled coordinates @xmath724",
    ". then define @xmath725 considering test functions of the form @xmath726 , where @xmath727 denotes the penrose limit metric , it is straightforward to show using that @xmath728 it follows that the operator @xmath729 is , as the notation suggests , a green function associated with the plane wave spacetime obtained by taking a penrose limit with @xmath601 and @xmath598 .",
    "this argument carries through essentially without change for green functions associated with all higher - rank tensor fields .",
    "we have thus established that there is a sense in which the leading order singular behavior of all tensor wave equations can be understood by considering appropriate plane wave green functions .",
    "this paper discusses the transport of disturbances in scalar fields propagating on curved spacetimes . in particular , we study how light cone caustics affect the character of singularities appearing in the relevant green functions .",
    "this problem is addressed in two steps .",
    "first , explicit green functions are obtained for massless scalar fields propagating on all non - singular four - dimensional plane wave spacetimes .",
    "we then show in sect .",
    "[ sect : penrose ] that penrose limits provide a sense in which certain aspects of these solutions are universal : the leading order singular structure of scalar green functions associated with essentially all four - dimensional spacetimes can be described by appropriate plane wave green functions .",
    "the plane wave green functions we obtain are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sect : globalsoln ] .",
    "they are globally defined and fully explicit [ up to the calculation of the @xmath91 matrices @xmath179 and @xmath180 defined by and ] . almost everywhere , plane wave green functions are found to have a `` hadamard - like '' component . using @xmath24 and @xmath347 to denote synge s function and the van vleck determinant ( which are well - defined almost everywhere in plane wave spacetimes )",
    ", we find that there exist green functions that switch between the forms @xmath730 and @xmath731 after each pass through a conjugate hyperplane .    as described in sect .",
    "[ sect : genericgreen ] , there is a sense in which ( say ) retarded green functions @xmath688 satisfying in generic spacetimes contain similar hadamard - like terms near any future - directed null geodesic emanating from @xmath12 .",
    "fixing some point @xmath11 on such a null geodesic ( that is not conjugate to @xmath12 ) , precisely which hadamard form is appropriate depends only on the pattern of multiplicities of all points conjugate to @xmath12 that lie between @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "following rules - , crossing a non - degenerate ( multiplicity 1 ) conjugate point is found to change a green function involving @xmath732 into one involving @xmath733 .",
    "conversely , non - degenerate conjugate points transform green functions proportional to @xmath733 into ones proportional to @xmath734 .",
    "one pass through a conjugate point with multiplicity two is seen to have the same effect as two passes through conjugate points with multiplicity one .",
    "this merely reverses signs : @xmath735 or @xmath736 .    in this way ,",
    "we have derived and made significantly more precise ori s comments @xcite regarding changes in the singularity structure of green functions due to light cone caustics .",
    "the result is a simple universal rule that is  unlike most results regarding caustics  naturally stated in terms of distributions on the spacetime manifold ( as opposed to statements involving fourier transforms ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the object @xmath24 appearing in the leading order singular structure of a generic green function @xmath737 is not the world function @xmath738 associated with the spacetime @xmath601 .",
    "@xmath738 is typically ill - defined when its arguments are widely separated .",
    "@xmath24 is , instead , the world function of an appropriate plane wave spacetime obtained via a penrose limit .",
    "this _ is _ well - defined almost everywhere .",
    "similar comments also apply to the van vleck determinant @xmath347 , which effectively measures the `` strength '' of the leading order singular terms appearing in a generic retarded green function .",
    "explicit forms for both @xmath24 and @xmath347 are easily computed in arbitrary spacetimes using the results of sects .",
    "[ sect : bitensors ] and [ sect : penrosedef ] .",
    "the rules we derive for changes in a green function s singular structure have a simple heuristic interpretation .",
    "one might think of degenerate conjugate points as events where bundles of light rays are perfectly focused in every direction .",
    "sharp solutions involving @xmath1 might therefore be expected to remain sharp after passing through a degenerate conjugate point . similarly ,",
    "more diffuse solutions like @xmath739 might be expect to remain diffuse in such an encounter .",
    "conjugate points with multiplicity 1 are different .",
    "they focus null geodesics in only one transverse direction .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect sharp solutions like @xmath1 to be `` blurred out '' by such structures .",
    "somewhat less intuitive is that the nature of this blurring is always such that another pass through a non - degenerate conjugate point `` resharpens '' the field back into a form involving @xmath1 .    an important special case of this work concerns the behavior of retarded green functions associated with scalar fields in the kerr spacetime .",
    "all conjugate points appearing on null geodesics of kerr are non - degenerate .",
    "scalar green functions in kerr therefore change singularity structure according to the 4-fold pattern .",
    "this result includes as a special case the 4-fold behavior observed by dolan and ottewill @xcite in schwarzschild green functions .",
    "the problem of wave propagation in curved spacetime is a very general one with many applications .",
    "our results may therefore be useful in a number of fields .",
    "one possible application concerns the computation of self - forces : what is the force exerted by a small object on itself in a curved spacetime ?",
    "one may assume that the total field is the retarded solution and find the force that this exerts on a given body .",
    "in generic spacetimes , the result depends on the object s past history at least via the tail term @xmath37 appearing in .",
    "it has , however , been less clear precisely how light cone caustics in the distant past contribute to an object s self - field ( see , e.g. , @xcite for some related discussion ) . more generally , it is important to understand `` how much '' of a charge s past history influences its current self - field .",
    "our results may be useful in answering this question .",
    "other applications could exist even in systems where the spacetime curvature is negligible .",
    "wave equations on curved spacetimes are mathematically equivalent to various physically different problems in flat spacetime . for example",
    ", one might use the same equations to describe the propagation of acoustic waves in a moving fluid or electromagnetic waves in certain classes of permeable materials @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to translate the results of this paper to more readily apply to problems such as these .",
    "the physical meaning of the penrose limit would be particularly interesting to understand in some of these `` analog gravity '' systems .",
    "there are two additional ways in which this work could be extended .",
    "most obviously , it would be extremely useful to generalize our results to apply to wave equations involving tensor fields with nonzero rank .",
    "the singularity structure of disturbances in , e.g. , electromagnetic fields and metric perturbations could then be understood in a relatively simple way .",
    "we carry out one portion of this task in sect .",
    "[ sect : tensorgeneralize ] , where penrose limits are used to relate generic tensor green functions to appropriate plane wave green functions .",
    "although there does not appear to be any significant obstacle to doing so , we have not made any attempt to compute plane wave green functions for higher - rank tensor fields in this paper .",
    "a complete discussion of the leading order singularity structure of tensor green functions must therefore wait for later work .",
    "it might also be interesting to extend our work to higher numbers of dimensions . in the four - dimensional case considered here ,",
    "the rules describing how green functions transition between different singular structures suggest that passing through a conjugate point with multiplicity 2 is equivalent to two passes through conjugate points with multiplicity 1 . while it appears likely that such a rule generalizes for larger multiplicities , it would be interesting to verify this directly .",
    "is one pass through a conjugate point with multiplicity @xmath740 in a spacetime with dimension @xmath741 equivalent to @xmath151 passes through conjugate points with multiplicity 1 ?",
    "questions related to higher dimensions are perhaps not only of mathematical interest .",
    "higher - dimensional plane wave spacetimes and penrose limits have found extensive use in string theory and related subjects @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the effects of light cone caustics on the propagation of linear scalar fields in generic four - dimensional spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we analyze the singular structure of relevant green functions . as expected from general theorems , green functions associated with wave equations are globally singular along a large class of null geodesics . despite this , the `` nature '' of the singularity on a given geodesic </S>",
    "<S> does not necessarily remain fixed . </S>",
    "<S> it can change character on encountering caustics of the light cone . </S>",
    "<S> these changes are studied by first deriving global green functions for scalar fields propagating on smooth plane wave spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> we then use penrose limits to argue that there is a sense in which the `` leading order singular behavior '' of a ( typically unknown ) green function associated with a generic spacetime can always be understood using a ( known ) green function associated with an appropriate plane wave spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> this correspondence is used to derive a simple rule describing how green functions change their singular structure near some reference null geodesic . </S>",
    "<S> such changes depend only on the multiplicities of the conjugate points encountered along the reference geodesic . using @xmath0 to denote a suitable generalization of synge s world function , conjugate points with multiplicity 1 convert green function singularities involving @xmath1 into singularities involving @xmath2 ( and vice - versa ) . </S>",
    "<S> conjugate points with multiplicity 2 may be viewed as having the effect of two successive passes through conjugate points with multiplicity 1 . </S>",
    "<S> separately , we provide an extensive review of plane wave geometry that may be of independent interest . </S>",
    "<S> explicit forms for bitensors such as synge s function , the van vleck determinant , and the parallel and jacobi propagators are derived almost everywhere for all non - singular four - dimensional plane waves . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behaviors of various objects near caustics are also discussed . </S>"
