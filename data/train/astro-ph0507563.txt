    "the thin accretion disk model describes flows in which the viscous heating of the gas radiates out of the system immediately after generation ( shakura @xmath0 sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "however , another kind of accretion has been studied during recent years where radiative energy losses are small so that most of the energy is advected with the gas",
    ". these adection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) occur in two regimes depending on the mass accretion rate and the optical depth . at very high mass accretion rate ,",
    "the optical depth becomes very high and the radiation can be trapped in the gas .",
    "this type of accretion which is known under the name slim accretion disk has been studied in detail by abramowicz et al .",
    "but when the accretion rate is very small and the optical depth is very low , we may have another type of accretion ( narayan & yi 1994 ; abramowitz et al . 1995 ; chen 1995 ) .",
    "however , numerical simulations of radiatively inefficient accretion flows revealed that low viscosity flows are convectively unstable and convection strongly influences the global properties of the flow ( e.g. , igumenshchev , abramowicz , @xmath0 narayan 2000 ) .",
    "thus , another type of accretion flows has been proposed , in which convection plays as a dominant mechanism of transporting angular momentum and the local released viscous energy ( e.g. , narayan , igumenshchev , @xmath0 abramowicz 2000 ) .",
    "this diversity of models tells us that modeling the hot accretion flows is a challenging and controversial problem .",
    "we think , one of the largely neglected physical ingredient in this field , is _ thermal conduction_. but a few authors tried to study the role of `` turbulent '' heat transport in adaf - like flows ( honma 1996 ; manmoto et al .",
    "2000 ) since thermal conduction acts to oppose the formation of the temperature gradient that causes it , one might expect that the temperature and density profiles for accretion flows in which thermal conduction plays a significant role to appear different compared to those flows in which thermal conduction is less effective .",
    "just recently , menou ( 2005 ) studied the effect of saturated thermal conduction on optically thin adafs using an extension of self - similar solutions of narayan @xmath0 yi ( 2004 ) .",
    "his solutions suggest that thermal conduction may be an important physical factor to understand hot accretion onto dim accreting black holes .",
    "the aim of the work presented here is to investigate whether thermal conduction can affect the dynamics of an optically _ thick _ radiation - dominated accretion flow . in  2 , we present a height - integrated set of equations of the model .",
    "self - similar solutions are investigated in  3 .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary of the results in  4 .",
    "in order to implement thermal conductivity correctly it is essential to know whether the mean free path is less than ( or comparable to ) the scale length of the temperature gradient . for electron mean free path which are greater than the scale length of the temperature gradient the thermal conductivity is said to saturate and the heat flux approaches a limiting value ( cowie & mckee 1977 ) .",
    "but when the mean free paths are much less than the temperature gradient the heat flux depends on the coefficient of thermal conductivity and the temperature gradient .",
    "generally , thermal conduction transfers heat so as to oppose the temperature gradient which causes the transfer .",
    "menou ( 2005 ) discussed hot accretion likely proceed under weakly - collisional conditions in these systems .",
    "thus , a saturated form of `` microscopic '' thermal conduction is physically well - motivated , as we apply in this study . however , one of the primary problems for studying the effects of thermal conduction in plasmas is the unknown value of the thermal conductivity .",
    "we consider an accretion disk that is axisymmetric and geometrically thin , i.e. @xmath1 . here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the disk radius and the half - thickness .",
    "our model generalizes the usual slim disks around a neutron star or a black hole ( e.g. , muchotrzeb & paczyski 1982 ; matsumoto et al . 1984 ; abramowicz et al . 1988 ) by including the effect of thermal conduction .",
    "the disk is supposed to be turbulent and possesses an effective turbulent viscosity .",
    "we assume the generated energy due to viscous dissipation and the heat conducted into the volume is concerned are balanced by the advection cooling .",
    "consider stationary height - integrated equations described an accretion flow onto a central object of mass @xmath4 . in absence of mass outflows ,",
    "the continuity equation reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the accretion rate , @xmath7 is the accretion velocity ( and @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 is the surface density at a cylindrical radius . also , @xmath10 is the midplane density of the disk .",
    "the equation of motion in the radial direction is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the integrated disk pressure written , in a form compatible with radiation - dominated flow , as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is black body constant and @xmath15 denotes the midplane temperature of the disk .",
    "similarly , integration over @xmath16 of the azimuthal equation of motion gives @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a kinematic viscosity coefficient and we assume @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant less than unity ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are sound speed and the keplerian velocity , respectively : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "now , we can write the energy equation considering the cooling and the heating processes of the accretion flow . the locally released energy due to viscous dissipation , @xmath26 , and the energy transported by thermal conduction , @xmath27 , are balanced by the advection cooling , @xmath28 .",
    "thus , @xmath29 the advection cooling reads ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the ratio of the gas to the total pressure and @xmath32 since we are considering the extreme case of radiation - dominated accretion flow , we have @xmath33 and so @xmath34 . also , we have    @xmath35^{2},\\ ] ]    and ( cowie & mckee 1977 ) @xmath36 where as we have already mentioned @xmath37 is the saturated conduction flux on the direction of the temperature gradient ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the self - similar solution is not able to describe the global behaviour of the accretion flow , because no boundary condition has been taken into account . however , as long as we are not interested in the the behaviour of the flow at the boundaries , such solution describes correctly the true solution asymptotically at large radii .",
    "we assume that each physical quantity can be expressed as a power law of the radial distance , i.e. @xmath39 , where the power index @xmath18 is determined for each physical quantity self - consistently .",
    "the solutions are @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 provide convenient units with which the equations can be written in the non - dimensional form .",
    "thus , we obtain the following system of dimensionless equations , to be solved for @xmath14 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is nondimensional mass accretion rate . after some algebraic manipulations we find @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath50 is obtained from a forth order algebraic equation : @xmath61 we can solve this algebraic equation numerically and clearly only the real root which corresponds to positive @xmath62 is a physical solution .    if we neglect the thermal conduction ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) , the above equation reduces to a second order equation which can be solved analytically ( wang @xmath0 zhou 1999 ; shadmehri & khajenabi 2005 ) . in this case , the typical behaviour of the solutions can be summarized as follows ( shadmehri & khajenabi 2005 ) : ( 1 ) the surface density increases with the accretion rate , and decreases with viscosity coefficient @xmath20 ; ( 2 ) but the radial velocity is directly proportional to @xmath20 ; ( 3 ) the gas rotates with sub - keplerian angular velocity , more or less independent of the coefficient @xmath20 ; and ( 4 ) the opening angle of the disk is fixed , independent of @xmath20 and @xmath64 . note that shadmehri @xmath0 khajenabi ( 2005 ) applied a diffusive prescription for the viscous stress tensor in their analysis of the self - similar solution of optically thick advection - dominated flows , but wang @xmath0 zhou ( 1999 ) applied the @xmath65 prescription",
    "however , the typical behaviours of the solutions are the same , irrespective of some differences in the coefficients .    the equations ( [ eq : a ] ) , ( [ eq : b ] ) , ( [ eq : c ] ) , ( [ eq : d ] ) together with equation ( [ eq : main ] ) describes self - similar behaviour of the optically thick advection dominated accretion disk with saturated thermal conduction .",
    "the algebraic equation ( [ eq : main ] ) shows that the variable @xmath50 which determines the opening angle of the disk depends only on the @xmath20 and @xmath66 .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the case without thermal conduction .",
    "thus , one can deduce that the surface density and the pressure are directly proportional to the mass accretion rate according to the equations ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : d ] ) .",
    "but the rotational and the radial velocities are both independent of the mass accretion rate ( see equations ( [ eq : b ] ) and ( [ eq : c ] ) ) .",
    "also , we can say that the rotational velocity is sub - keplerian according to the equation ( [ eq : b ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the properties of the rotational and the radial velocities on @xmath20 and @xmath66 is illustrated in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "we consider three values of the viscosity parameter , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for which the velocities are plotted as a function of @xmath66 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent the ratios @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "while the solution without thermal conduction are recovered at small @xmath66 values , we can see significant deviation as @xmath66 increases . clearly , the rotational velocity decreases with the magnitude of conduction parameter .",
    "but for the radial velocity the behaviour is different , i.e. the velocity increases as @xmath66 increases . for a fixed viscosity parameter @xmath20 ,",
    "the solution reaches the non - rotating limit at a specific value of @xmath71 which we denotes by @xmath72 .",
    "if we extend our solution to @xmath73 , the equation ( [ eq : b ] ) gives negative @xmath62 which is clearly unacceptable .",
    "the critical value @xmath72 can be calculated easily : @xmath74 the above equation shows the critical magnitude of conduction parameter for which the solution tends to the non - rotating limit depends only on the viscosity coefficient so that as @xmath20 increases , the breakdown of the solutions occurs at larger values of @xmath66 .",
    "but as menou ( 2005 ) mentioned in his analysis of optically thin adafs with saturated conduction , we think this behaviour is a simple pathological feature of 1d height - integrated equations we solved .",
    "solutions of equation ( [ eq : main ] ) show that for a fixed @xmath20 , the variable @xmath50 increases with conduction parameter @xmath66 . since the gas temperature varies directly in proportion to @xmath50 , we can say as the level of thermal conduction is increased the temperature of flow in comparison to solutions without thermal conduction increases .",
    "in fact , thermal conduction behaves as an extra heating source . also , equation ( [ eq : a ] ) shows the surface density decreases as @xmath66 increases .",
    "we can compare the relative values of advection cooling , viscous heating and the transported energy by conduction using our self - similar solutions .",
    "one can simply show that @xmath75 and @xmath76 . while both these ratios",
    "do nt depend on the mass accretion rate , the viscosity parameter @xmath20 and the thermal conduction parameter @xmath66 determine the relative importance of the various physical processes in the system .",
    "viscous energy dissipation decreases as @xmath66 increases , but the contribution of the energy transported by the conduction becomes more significant .",
    "in this paper we have studied an optically thick adafs with thermal conduction .",
    "considering the weakly - collisional nature of hot accretion flows , a saturated form of thermal conduction has been used as a possible mechanism of transporting of energy .",
    "although our self - similar solutions have their own limitations , they can illuminate some possible effects of the saturated thermal conduction on radiation - dominated accretion flows .",
    "we can summarize the main features of our solutions : ( 1 ) the surface density is in proportion to the mass accretion rate and it increases as the level of the thermal conduction is increased .",
    "( 2 ) the temperature of the gas increases with thermal conduction parameter and the conduction term in the energy equation acts as an extra source of heating . ( 3 ) the angular velocity is sub - keplerian , but it decreases with increasing thermal conduction parameter so that it tends to a non - rotating limit .",
    "( 4 ) however , the radial velocity increases with thermal conduction parameter .",
    "considering these significant effects of the thermal conduction , global transonic solutions representing optically thick ( or thin ) adafs with thermal conduction would be an interesting topic for future studies and our results are a step toward this goal ."
