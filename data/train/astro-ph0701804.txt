    "the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) detected by the swift ( gehrels _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) burst alert telescope ( bat ; barthelmy _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) during a slew on 18 february 2006 looked unusual right from the beginning .",
    "the initial burst of @xmath0-rays was both exceptionally long ( t@xmath1 = 2100 @xmath2 100  s ) and peaked at a very low energy ( 4.9@xmath3  kev ) , the latter of which classifies the event as an x - ray flash ( xrf ) . at the redshift of the event , z=0.03345 @xmath2 0.0006 ( mirabal et al .",
    "2006 ) making it the second closest grb yet detected , its isotropic equivalent energy was e@xmath4 = 6 @xmath5 10@xmath6 erg which is 100 to 1000 times less than most grbs . by way of comparison ,",
    "grb 980425 , the first grb to be identified with a supernova , had a much shorter t@xmath1 of 23.3 @xmath2 1.4  s ( galama _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , a higher e@xmath7 of 55 @xmath2 21  kev , and a lower e@xmath4 of ( 1.0 @xmath2 0.2 ) @xmath5 10@xmath8  erg ( amati 2006 ) .    during the first 3000  s of the swift observation of grb 060218 ( figure [ 1storbit ] ) the 0.3 to 10  kev x - ray lightcurve from the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; burrows _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) shows a smooth peak and gradual decay , whilst after 3000  s the optical v - band flux observed with the uv / optical telescope ( uvot ; roming _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) is still rising .",
    "10  ks after the beginning of the burst ( figure [ total_lcs]a ) , the exponentially decaying x - ray lightcurve gives way to a power - law decay of the type more typically seen in grb afterglows .",
    "the optical / uv flux registered by the uvot ( figure [ total_lcs]b ) rises to a uv dominated peak at @xmath9 40  ks , and later on to a peak dominated by optical light at 600  ks .",
    "all of this unusual phenomenology offers clues as to the nature of the progenitor and the physical evolution of the event , which i will discuss in the following sections .",
    "these observations and their interpretation are presented in greater detail by campana _",
    "the early behaviour of the x - ray emission gives us information about the progenitor .",
    "the x - ray spectrum compiled from data taken during the first 3  ks shows ( figure [ xrtspec ] ) that there is a thermal component to the emission as well as the power - law typically observed in grb spectra .",
    "the flux in this thermal component evolves with time ; its flux is plotted alongside the total x - ray flux in figure [ total_lcs]a .",
    "the thermal flux dominates the x - ray emission between @xmath9 2 and 8  ks after the beginning of the event , but dies away exponentially after that point . fitting a blackbody model to this thermal emission using xspec",
    ", we obtained a temperature of kt @xmath10 0.17 kev .",
    "the characteristic radius @xmath11 of the emitting region can be estimated as :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the equivalent isotropic power of the grb , @xmath14 is the radiation density constant and @xmath15 is the thermal temperature .",
    "the resulting radius , @xmath9 5@xmath510@xmath16  cm , would imply a blue supergiant progenitor , but the lack of hydrogen lines in the optical spectra of the supernova ( e.g. mazzali _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) implies a more compact star .",
    "the larger apparent radius can , however , be explained by the presence of a massive stellar wind .",
    "assuming that the early expansion of the emitting region was linear , due to light - travel - time effects , we can estimate an initial progenitor radius of ( 4 @xmath2 1)@xmath510@xmath17  cm .",
    "this size , and the presence of the optically thick stellar wind , implies that the progenitor was a wolf - rayet star .",
    "3 ks after the beginning of the event , with the best fitting spectral model superimposed on the data .",
    "the thermal and power - law components are also plotted.,width=453 ]",
    "the shockwave of the explosion becomes visible when it reaches the radius when the wind becomes optically thin .",
    "the shock is probably non - spherical , since the characteristic radius @xmath11 , which is calculated on the assumption of spherical symmetry , is larger than the radius of the blackbody as fitted to the xrt data .",
    "this may be due to the presence of the presumed grb jet , or perhaps to the stellar wind being non - spherical .",
    "since we actually observe the process of the shock breaking out of the stellar wind , we can constrain the delay between the grb and supernova start to be less than 4  ks .",
    "the shock compresses the wind to a thin shell .",
    "the optical depth must be about 1 , so we can obtain its opacity , estimate the mass of the shell and therefore the wind mass - loss rate @xmath18 :    @xmath19    where we take @xmath20 = 10@xmath21  cm  s@xmath22 , a typical value for wolf - rayet stars .",
    "we obtain @xmath23 @xmath9 3@xmath510@xmath24  @xmath25  yr@xmath22 , and using the radius @xmath11 , the wind density @xmath26 @xmath9 10@xmath16  g  @xmath27 . the thermal energy density behind a radiation - dominated shock is    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the blackbody temperature and @xmath30 is the shock speed . using @xmath26 that we have calculated , @xmath30",
    "at the uv emission peak observed with the uvot , the blackbody emission in the uv and optical is far higher than that expected from the shock . instead , the emission is probably from the expanding stellar remnant .",
    "the expansion of the remnant is traced by the evolution of the broad - band uvot spectrum , as shown in figure [ uvotspec ] . at the time of the earliest spectrum in the figure , 32  ks ( figure [ uvotspec]a ) ,",
    "the peak of the blackbody is still far higher than the uvot band , and so the uvot spectrum consists of the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody which is cut into by intrinsic extinction in the grb host .",
    "this allows us to fit the depth of the extinction , which is then fixed in subsequent fits of the blackbody parameters . using the _ zdust _ model in xspec",
    ", we obtain an intrinsic e(b - v ) = 0.20 @xmath2 0.03 , assuming an smc reddening law ( pei , 1992 ) .",
    "one hundred and twenty kiloseconds after the beginning of the event ( figure [ uvotspec]b ) , the blackbody peak is centred in the uvot band and so its temperature and radius can be fitted .",
    "we obtain kt @xmath9 3.7@xmath31 ev and @xmath32 = 3.29@xmath33  cm .",
    "this radius implies an expansion speed of 27000 @xmath2 8000  km  s@xmath22 , consistent with the speeds obtained from optical spectroscopy ( e.g. sollerman _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 , pian _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 , mazzali _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) . by 300  ks ( figure [ uvotspec]c ) ,",
    "the remnant has cooled to the extent that elements can combine , and so the uv flux is drastically decreased from that point on by line blanketing .",
    "finally , at 750  ks ( figure [ uvotspec]d ) , the optical band has re - brightened due to radioactive decay in the supernova remnant .",
    "our conclusions are , then , that the progenitor of grb060218/sn2006aj was a wolf - rayet star , and that the one - of - a - kind lightcurves obtained with swift signify the breakout of the shockwave from the dense stellar wind of the progenitor , and the expansion and cooling of the stellar remnant .",
    "this unusual event was followed up by many other telescopes and observers , leading to a range of novel possibilities and conclusions .",
    "firstly , the probable @xmath920  m@xmath34 mass of the progenitor was low enough for a magnetar remnant rather than a black hole to have formed , leading to the intriguing suggestion that xrfs are the magnetic activity of magnetars forming from the implosion of low mass progenitors , whilst gamma - ray bursts signal the collapse of high mass stars and the formation of black holes ( mazzali _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 , soderberg _ et al .",
    "the presence or otherwise of relativistic ejecta or a collimated jet may also be a fundamental distinction between supernovae accompanied by grbs , and those which are not ( soderberg _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 , pian _ et al .",
    "whatever the compact remnant is , the long duration of the afterglow is a sign of continuing activity of a rapidly spinning central engine ( soderberg _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 , fan _ et al .",
    "the fact that this low - luminosity event was even detected implies that there is a much larger number of such events than previously thought ; perhaps , even , that they are the most common high - energy transient events in the universe ( cobb _ et al .",
