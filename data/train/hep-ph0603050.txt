    "strongly interacting matter at non - zero baryon density and high temperature is a subject of great interest for a wide spectrum of physicists . a deep understanding of the different facets of strongly interacting matter , especially ,",
    "the physics of colour deconfinement might help us to get a better picture of various astrophysical and cosmological phenomena .",
    "huge accelerators have been built at cern , geneva @xcite and at rhic , brookhaven @xcite to collide beams of heavy nuclei at relativistic energies to recreate the matter in such extreme conditions .",
    "the focus of the heavy - ion physics program is to study and understand properties like the emergence of macroscopic collective phenomenon and their role on the evolution of a strongly interacting system .",
    "the analysis of data so obtained requires a proper understanding of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interactions .",
    "the thermodynamic properties are obtained from the qcd equation of state ( eos ) and various transport coefficients .",
    "the weak coupling expansion of the free energy within perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , is presently known @xcite to order @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "however , in spite of the higher order , the series show a deceptively poor convergence except for coupling constants as low as @xmath9 , corresponding to temperature as high as @xmath10 .",
    "there has been significant recent activity to improve on this convergence by hard thermal loop ( htl ) re - summation schemes @xcite which give a description of the plasma in terms of weakly interacting hard and soft quasi - particles @xcite .",
    "the former are massive excitations with masses @xmath11 , while latter are either on - shell collective excitations or virtual quanta exchange in the interactions between hard particles .",
    "in contrast to ordinary perturbation theory , the htl and its next - to - leading order approximations are well controlled in the regime above @xmath12 , which is however , much higher than the temperature range in present day heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in addition the different approaches within the same general framework of htl approximations lead to different predictions @xcite , and can not be made fully systematic when applied to thermodynamics . at the same time",
    ", this approach lacks a reliable and comprehensive description below @xmath13 due to their stronger sensitivity to non - perturbative collective phenomena .",
    "there is also a non - perturbative first principle method to compute the contribution of the soft fields to the thermodynamics . at high temperatures the hard modes",
    "get large temperature dependent masses , which are then integrated out leaving a three - dimensional effective theory .",
    "this method is known as dimensional reduction @xcite . however , as expected , this method is not well - suited for lower temperature and the susceptibilities calculated from these method @xcite do not agree with those of lattice qcd computations below @xmath14 .",
    "exploring the qualitative features of strongly interacting matter and making quantitative predictions of its properties from first principles is the central goal of numerical studies of equilibrium thermodynamics of qcd within the framework of lattice regularization . over the years",
    "this formulation has given us a wealth of information ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it has now been established that there is only a crossover of normal hadronic matter to a state of deconfined quarks and gluons at temperature @xmath15 . at this temperature , deconfinement of _ color _ charge and restoration of chiral symmetry",
    "is found to occur simultaneously .",
    "moreover , the equation of state , various susceptibilities and transport coefficients have been obtained . to perform lattice qcd computations at non - zero chemical potential",
    "however is still a non - trivial task due to the complex fermion determinant .",
    "recently though , there have been various new developments to tackle this problem for small chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "generally the qcd inspired phenomenological models are much easier to handle compared to lattice or the perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "but in all these models despite their simplicity , the absence of a proper order parameter for deconfinement transition adds to the uncertainties inherent in such studies and hence reduces the predictive power of such models .",
    "the thermal average of the polyakov loop can be considered to be the order parameter for deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "hence a judicious use of the polyakov loop in effective models may prove to be of great advantage .",
    "some important developments have taken place in obtaining effective theories for polyakov loop from that of the temporal background gauge field @xcite .",
    "it is expected that such an effective theory for the polyakov loop should work at least near the phase transition where long distance physics become important .",
    "more recently , the parameters in these effective theories have been fixed @xcite using the lattice data ( similar comparisons of perturbative effects on polyakov loop with lattice data above the deconfinement transition was studied in @xcite ) .",
    "these polyakov loop models have been applied in the context of cosmology @xcite .    for non - zero chemical potential",
    "there are various qcd inspired models which indicate ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) that at low temperatures there is a possibility of first order phase transition for a large baryon chemical potential @xmath16 .",
    "this @xmath16 is supposed to decrease with increasing temperature .",
    "thus there is a first order phase transition line starting from ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) on the @xmath19 axis in the ( @xmath20,@xmath19 ) phase diagram which steadily bends towards the ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) point and may actually terminate at a critical end point ( cep ) characterized by ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , which can be detected via enhanced critical fluctuations in heavy - ion reactions @xcite .",
    "the location of this cep has become a topic of major importance in effective model studies ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) . also on the lattice the cep was located for the physical @xcite and for somewhat larger @xcite quark masses using the reweighting technique of @xcite , and for taylor expansion method in @xcite .",
    "thus the broad picture of qcd thermodynamics is becoming more transparent with the combination of research in the areas of perturbative qcd , effective models and lattice computations . in this paper",
    "we study some of the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter using the polyakov loop @xmath25 nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind the pnjl model is to couple the chiral and deconfinement order parameters inside a single framework .",
    "similar approach to understand qcd thermodynamics is being actively pursued by various authors ( see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "here we shall first compute the eos and the quark number susceptibilities .",
    "susceptibilities in general , are related to fluctuations via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the difference in fluctuations of various conserved quantities like baryon number , electric charge etc . in the hadronic and deconfined phases",
    "is supposed to signal the phase transition between these two phases in heavy - ion reactions @xcite .",
    "measurements of these fluctuations have taken a central place in the heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "recently , computations on the lattice have obtained many of these susceptibilities at zero chemical potential @xcite , and our first aim would be to compare the corresponding quantities extracted from the pnjl model . as we shall show here that the agreement of the values obtained from the pnjl model is quite satisfactory with the lattice data .",
    "subsequently we have studied few more quantities of interest .",
    "one such quantity is the specific heat @xmath4 , which is related to the event - by - event temperature fluctuations @xcite , and mean transverse momentum fluctuations @xcite in heavy - ion reactions .",
    "these fluctuations should show a diverging behaviour near the cep .",
    "next , we obtain the speed of sound ( basically its square , @xmath5 ) , which determines the flow properties in heavy - ion reactions @xcite . using the proper hydrodynamic equations including the speed of sound it is possible to analyze the rapidity distribution of secondary particles in collision experiments @xcite .",
    "finally we obtain the conformal measure @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the interaction measure and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the energy density and pressure of strongly interacting matter .",
    "as has been pointed out in @xcite , the conformal measure seems to be emerging as an important measure to draw similarities between long distance physics of qcd and conformal field theory , with results coming from both the areas of ads / cft correspondence @xcite , rhic data @xcite and lattice computations @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the pnjl model briefly . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the formalisms .",
    "the eos has been obtained from the lagrangian of pnjl model in mean - field approximation .",
    "the taylor expansion coefficients of pressure with respect to the quark number chemical potential @xmath3 , is written down .",
    "we also present the various formulae for @xmath4 , @xmath30 and @xmath6 . in section 4",
    ", we present our results and comparisons with lattice data .",
    "finally we conclude with a discussion in section 5 .",
    "the pnjl model was first introduced in ref.@xcite to couple the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for most recent developments ) , with the polyakov loop .",
    "recently , this has been extended in refs.@xcite to include the polyakov loop effective potential @xcite .",
    "while the njl part is supposed to give the correct chiral properties , the polyakov loop part should simulate the deconfinement physics .",
    "indeed such a synthesis worked well to firstly confirm the `` coincidence '' of onset of chiral restoration and deconfinement as observed in lattice simulations ( see discussions in ref.@xcite ) in the pnjl model @xcite .",
    "secondly , the pressure , scaled pressure difference , number density and the interaction measure were computed in ref.@xcite for two quark flavours , and all the quantities compared well with the lattice data .",
    "this model is supposed to work upto an upper limit of temperature , because here the gluon physics is contained only in a static background field that comes in the polyakov loop .",
    "however , transverse degrees of freedom will be important for @xmath31 @xcite .    for the details of the pnjl model parameterization",
    ", the reader is referred to ref.@xcite .",

    "[ omega ]    here , @xmath32 is the effective potential for the traced polyakov loop @xmath33 and its conjugate @xmath34 , and @xmath20 is the temperature .",
    "the functional form of the potential is ,    = -b_2(t)2 | - b_36(^3 + |^3)+ b_44(| ) ^2  , [ uu ]    with    b_2(t)=a_0+a_1 ( ) + a_2 ( ) ^2+a_3()^3  .",
    "[ bb ]    the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 were fitted from lattice data of pure gauge theory .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is precisely the transition temperature for this theory , and as indicated by lattice data its value was chosen to be 270 mev @xcite . with the coupling to njl model",
    "the transition does nt remain first order . in this case from the peak in @xmath38 the transition ( or crossover ) temperature @xmath39 comes around 230 mev .",
    "the authors in ref.@xcite then reduce the @xmath37 to 190 mev such that the @xmath39 becomes about 180 mev , commensurate with lattice data with two flavours of dynamical fermions @xcite .",
    "however , we shall keep using @xmath40 , since for @xmath41 , there is about 25 mev shift in the chiral and deconfinement transitions with all other model parameters remaining fixed , as compared to less than 5 mev shift for @xmath40 .",
    "we have checked that for both the values of @xmath37 , the susceptibilities we measure , when plotted against @xmath42 show very little dependence on @xmath37 .",
    "the other notations in ( [ omega ] ) are as follows .",

    "given the thermodynamic potential , our job is to minimize it with respect to the fields @xmath43 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and calculate the necessary quantities with the values of the fields so obtained .",
    "here we give the details of the methods by which we have obtained the various thermodynamic quantities from the pnjl model .      the pressure as a function of temperature @xmath20 and baryon chemical potential @xmath3 is given by ,    p(t,_0 )",
    "= -(t,_0 )  .",
    "[ prsu ]    the first derivative of pressure with respect to @xmath3 gives the quark number density .",
    "the second derivative is the quark number susceptibility ( qns ) , which should show a power law divergence close to the cep . on the lattice where direct simulation for non - zero @xmath3 is not possible ,",
    "the qns and higher order derivatives ( hods ) computed at @xmath51 are used as taylor expansion coefficients to extract chemical potential dependence of pressure .",
    "in fact the convergence of such an expansion has been tested with the hods to obtain the cep . at this point",
    "we should mention that in the present model the isospin chemical potential @xmath52 has not been included , which will be necessary to study the isospin asymmetric qcd matter .",
    "also , the presence of diquark physics needs to be incorporated in the model to have a complete study of pnjl model for large @xmath3 .",
    "so , given @xmath53 as in the pnjl model we first solve numerically for @xmath43 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 using the following set of equations ,    = 0  ,   = 0  ,   | = 0  .",
    "[ solv ]    the values of the fields so obtained can then be used to evaluate all the thermodynamic quantities in mean - field approximation . to obtain the transition point",

    "the temperature difference between consecutive data is 0.1 mev .",
    "then we obtain the slope of the ( @xmath56 ) and the ( @xmath57 ) curves .",
    "however , instead of using the difference method of extracting the slope , we do a fit to a taylor expansion of the fields as a function of @xmath20 , around the point where the slopes of the fields are required .",
    "we used a quadratic fitting function and the first order coefficient then gives us the required slope .",
    "we did the analysis more carefully near the transition where the slopes were obtained for every 1 mev difference .",
    "our results are identical to that obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the field values obtain from eqn.([solv ] ) are then put back into @xmath53 to obtain pressure from ( [ prsu ] ) .",

    "should be recovered for which @xmath6 should go to zero .",
    "our results in this respect resemble the pure gauge lattice results very closely .",
    "we have studied several thermodynamic quantities of recent interest in qcd , in the framework of polyakov - loop extended njl ( pnjl ) model .",
    "inclusion of polyakov loop in the njl model covers both the confinement as well as chiral symmetry breaking ; the two most important characteristics of low energy qcd .",
    "the polyakov - loop provides with the order parameter for deconfinement transition while the quark condensate acts as the order parameter for chiral transition .",
    "it is well known that the measurement of various fluctuations is of crucial importance to understand the characteristics of transition of confined matter to deconfined state .",
    "so , using the pnjl model , we have computed the derivatives of pressure upto eight order .",
    "it is expected that the susceptibilities might provide the most direct evidence for the order of qcd phase transition .",
    "in fact , a well defined peak in the susceptibility can indicate the cross over transition . on the other hand",
    ", a sharp diverging behaviour would indicate the existence of cep .    in the present paper",
    ", we have kept our computation close to @xmath58 axis .",
    "the second derivative of pressure @xmath76 rises steeply near @xmath39 and then saturates near @xmath92 .",
    "this behaviour indicates that near the transition the quark number fluctuations increase with temperature and then gradually saturates at higher temperatures .",
    "such a behaviour is expected both from lattice as well as phenomenological studies .",
    "@xmath77 has a peak around @xmath39 , whereas , both @xmath78 and @xmath83 show rapid variation across @xmath39 . considering the inherent differences of model and lattice approaches , our results are in good agreement with the lattice data .",
    "there is however a significant difference found in the values of @xmath77 in the temperature range starting from a little above @xmath39 .",
    "we speculate this may have occurred due to the neglect of fluctuations around the mean field in our computations ; though one should keep in mind the very large masses used in lattice computations in contrast to the value of @xmath93 used in the pnjl model .",
    "we have also calculated the specific heat , speed of sound and the conformal measure .",
    "these results again are in close agreement with lattice data .",
    "there seems to be a dominance of gluonic contribution at high temperatures .",
    "near @xmath39 however there are small but significant difference in lattice data with pure qcd and that with dynamical quarks .",
    "our results in this temperature region match well with the latter set .",
    "there are several issues that need to be addressed for a better understanding of the physics of qcd phase transition .",
    "njl model works with constant four point coupling strength , the running coupling being averaged over a limited low energy kinematic domain . to make contact with qcd at high temperatures",
    "this coupling should have proper temperature dependence .",
    "moreover , the parameters in the polyakov - loop part should be tuned to get both the deconfinement and chiral transition within a temperature difference of couple of mevs at most and also below , say , 200 mev , as indicated by the lattice data .",
    "note that similar parameter fitting of the polyakov - loop in the pnjl model led the authors in ref.@xcite to couple the polyakov - loop and @xmath94 linear sigma model to study the @xmath95 ratio . however , there are more predictions in the present model , the most significant being the possibility of studying the qcd transition at finite baryon densities . above and",
    "all one should also worry about the mean - field approximation involved here .",
    "for the polyakov loop part , it would be worthwhile to explore approches similar to ref.@xcite , where a local polyakov loop has been coupled to the chiral lagrangian .",
    "we have not yet studied the system with large chemical potentials .",
    "as already noted in ref.@xcite , the pnjl model does have the requisite physics of a first order transition for low temperatures and high chemical potential , a cross - over for @xmath51 and thus a cep for some @xmath23 and @xmath96 .",
    "the details in this case may be compared to other njl model studies with high @xmath3 .",
    "for example the chiral symmetry broken phase and normal quark matter phase of ref.@xcite show a similar value of the cep .",
    "moreover it has been shown in ref.@xcite that with increase of strength of the diquark coupling the cep moves towards higher temperatures and slightly lower values of @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the inclusion of diquark physics may be important to assess the exact location of the phase boundary as well as the cep",
    ".    a natural extension of our work would be to include the isospin chemical potential and study the behaviour for isospin and electric charge fluctuations .",
    "we hope to address some of these issues in future .",
