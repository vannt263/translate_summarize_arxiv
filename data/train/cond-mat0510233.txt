    "the antisymmetrical many - electron wavefunctions constitute the basis for theory of strongly correlated electronic systems in atoms molecules and solids  the mathematical basis for such a technique in the spherically symmetrical case is well developed ( see e.g. [ 1,2 ] ) . on the other hand the applications of permutational symmetry  methods to solid state wavefunctions are rather scant .",
    "the method of two - electron wavefunctions construction in solids is mainly due to bradley and davies [ 3 ] who made use of mackey theorem on symmetrized squares of induced representations [ 4 ] .",
    "theory of relatively recently discovered unconventional superconductivity ( i.e. high t@xmath0 [ 5 ] and heavy fermion [ 6 ] ) is not developed yet , and symmetry considerations are very useful for understanding of electron structure of these new materials .",
    "non - totally symmetrical order parameter ( or the wavefunction of a cooper pair ) with line and point nodes on fermi surface is the mail feature of unconventional superconductors [ 7 ] .",
    "the induced representation method @xcite was used for construction of antisymmetrical wavefunctions in solids of different symmetry.[8 - 12 ] .",
    "this group theoretical approach revealed a new symmetrical feature of two - electron functions in solids : their nodal structure .",
    "comparison of group theoretical nodal structure for @xmath1 group with experimental data for unconventional superconductor @xmath2 resulted the @xmath3 symmetry for superconducting order parameter ( sop ) [ 11 ] .",
    "the space group approach makes possible construction of two - electron wavefunction by projection operator technique [ 12 ] .",
    "but it is clear from the shape of these functions that the commonly accepted interaction for a cooper pair in @xmath4 manifold can not give different energies for different irreducible representations ( irs ) .",
    "hence it follows that the interactions between other wave vector are important in solids .",
    "group theoretically it means that one should construct the four electron wavefunctions with zero total momentum i.e. cooper quartets . in the present work the space - group approach to two",
    "electron wavefunction is briefly reviewed and the theory is generalized to four - electron wavefunctions .",
    "the classification of four electron states connected by space inversion and mirror reflection is given making use young tables",
    "from a unitary ir @xmath5 of a subgroup @xmath6 one can construct a unitary representation of the whole group @xmath7 [ 13 ] .",
    "the structure of this unitary representation ( induced representation ) depends on the left coset decomposition of the whole group with respect to its subgroup : @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10    the induced representation is defined by the following formula :    @xmath11    where:@xmath12    following [ 13 ] we use an up directed arrow for the notation of induction .",
    "the indexes @xmath13 and @xmath14 in formula denote the block columns and rows of the induced representation matrix and correspond to the single coset decomposition ( 1 ) . the indexes @xmath15 and @xmath16 number the rows and columns of the small  ir  @xmath5 .    in the case of crystal symmetry the induced representation ( 2 )",
    "is irreducible representation of a space group , provided the group @xmath6 is a wave vector @xmath17 group ( _ little _  group ) and @xmath5 is its unitary ir ( _ small _  ir ) .",
    "the action of left coset representatives @xmath18 on the wave vector @xmath17 results all prongs of its star @xmath19 . in the case",
    "strong spin - orbit coupling the irs @xmath5 in formula ( 3 ) are replaced by double - valued _ small _ irs @xmath20 .    according to the pauli exclusion principle the total two - electron wavefunction is antisymmetric with respect to permutation of electronic coordinates .",
    "hence in a weak spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath21 scheme ) the symmetrized kronecker square of the spatial part of the wavefunction is combined with antisymmetrized kronecker square of its spin part ( singlet pair ) , and the antisymmetrized kronecker square of the spatial part of the wavefunction is combined with the symmetrized kronecker square of its spin part ( triplet pair ) . in a strong spin - orbit coupling case ( @xmath22 scheme )",
    "the wavefunction belongs to the antisymmetrized kronecker square or double - valued ir of the space group .",
    "according to anderson [ 14 ] the cooper pair wavefunction is invariant with respect to lattice translations hence it follows the consideration is limited by the centre of a brillouin zone for two - electron states .",
    "the structure of the kronecker square of an induced ir may be envisaged by the double coset decomposition of @xmath7 relative to @xmath6 which is written ( 3 ) as :    @xmath23    the sum runs over all distinct double cosets @xmath24    corresponding wave vector @xmath25 is defined by the following formula    @xmath26    the intersection of wave vector groups in the left hand side is written as : @xmath27for each double coset we consider a representation of subgroup @xmath28 defined by the formula :    @xmath29    where @xmath30    for self - inverse double coset , i.e. : @xmath31    there are two extensions of  @xmath32into the subgroup : @xmath33where@xmath34and@xmath35 .",
    "these extensions corresponding to symmetrized and antisymmetrized parts of kronecker square are defined in terms of their characters as follows :    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38where@xmath39 .",
    "the symmetrized and antisymmetrized parts of the kronecker square of induced representation are written by two following formulae respectively ( the mackey theorem [ 3 ] on kronecker squares ) :    @xmath40 = \\left [ q_{\\kappa } \\times q_{\\kappa } \\right ] \\uparrow g+\\sum_{\\alpha } p_{\\alpha } ^{_{^{+}}}\\uparrow g+\\sum_{\\beta } p_{\\beta } \\uparrow g   \\label{11}\\ ] ]    @xmath41    the first items on the right - hand sides of ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) correspond to the double coset defined by the identity element , @xmath42 corresponds to self - inverse double cosets and @xmath43 to non - self - inverse double cosets for which @xmath44 .  in the case of a strong spin - orbit coupling case",
    "the possible symmetries of two - electron states are obtained by substituting of double - valued irs into formula ( 12 ) .",
    "if the one - electron wave vector  @xmath17 belongs to a general point inside a brillouin zone the two - electron wave vector , defined by formula ( 4 ) , equals zero for the self - inverse double coset defined by the space inversion .",
    "the extended intersection group @xmath45 defined by formula ( 8) is the group @xmath46 consisting of two elements : @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for single - valued irs",
    "we immediately obtain that @xmath49 equals to ir @xmath50 of group @xmath46  and that @xmath51 equals to ir @xmath52 of group @xmath46 .",
    "these representations are induced into the central extension of the space group ( point group ) .",
    "the induced representation can be easily decomposed making use of the frobenius reciprocity theorem : the number of appearance of  the ir @xmath53 of the whole group in the decomposition of the induced representation @xmath54 equals to the number of appearance of ir @xmath20.in the decomposition of @xmath53when it subduced to the subgroup . making use of frobenius theorem we obtain two conclusions .",
    "firstly , in agreement with anderson ( 14 ) , we obtain that for @xmath17 a general point of a brillouin zone all even irs are possible for singlet pairs and all odd irs are possible for triplet pairs .",
    "secondly , the number of appearance of each ir equals to its dimension .",
    "hence it follows that for one - dimensional ir the result is unique , but for two - dimensional irs there are two non - equivalent basis functions and one can take any linear combinations . from this point of view",
    "experimentally observed double superconducting transition in @xmath2 ( 15 ) may be connected with two non - equivalent states corresponding to the same two - dimensional ir . to obtain total wavefunction of a cooper pair in a weak spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath55 scheme )",
    "one should multiply the spatial part of the wavefunction by spin singlet function @xmath56 for singlet pair and by spin triplet function @xmath57 for triplet pair .",
    "in strong spin orbital coupling case the representation @xmath58 equals to ir @xmath52 of group @xmath46 and even irs are missing . to obtain all possible pair symmetries ,",
    "the time reversal @xmath59  should be considered . in the absence of magnetic fields the total symmetry of a crystal with fedorov group @xmath7",
    "is described by the shubnikov ii ( grey ) magnetic group : @xmath60    where @xmath61 is a time - reversal operation    the time - reversal symmetry results in additional degeneration for one- dimensional small double - valued irs i.e. at general points and at the planes of symmetry in a brillouin zone . to obtain all possible two - electron states",
    "one should use induced corepresentations @xmath62 [ 13 ] in formula ( 12 ) .    for @xmath17 a general point in a brillouin zone the decomposition of corepresentation @xmath63 ( see formula ( 6 ) ) contains representations @xmath50 and @xmath64 of the group @xmath46 .",
    "the ir @xmath50 corresponds to singlet pair and @xmath64 correspond to three components of triplet pair .",
    "the superconducting state is usually more ordered than normal state , i.e. the transition to it is accompanied by the symmetry reduction[16 ] .",
    "one possible way is the time - reversal symmetry violation , i.e. transition from the direct product @xmath65 to ordinary fedorov group @xmath7 or to one the shubnikov group @xmath66 [ 13 ]",
    ". total number of different cases of construction of shubnikov groups is quite large . in order to envisage general trends we consider the simplified case of time reversal symmetry violation and its influence on the nodal structure of superconducting order parameter .",
    "ferromagnetic fluctuations can be approximated as time - reversal symmetry violation . in this case",
    "the one - electron states belong to double valued ir of the space group . for @xmath67 a general point of a brillouin zone we obtain for two - electron states two irs @xmath52 of group : one for spin up states and one for spin - down state .",
    "two remaining irs correspond to antiferromagnetic pairs : @xmath50 for singlet pair and @xmath52 for triplet pair .",
    "hence we obtain following formula for the character of the possible cooper pair representation ( reducible ) in the antiferromagnetic state    @xmath68    where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are obtained respectively by substitution of double valued _ small _  corepresentation and double - valued i into the formula antisymmetrized kronecker square of induced representation .",
    "it should be noted that formula ( 14 ) is valid in the case of one - dimensional double - valued small ir for one - electron states , i.e. at general points and at the planes of symmetry in one - electron brillouin zone .",
    "making use of formula(14 ) for a general point in a brillouin zone we obtain that the kronecker product decomposition for antiferromagnetic state contains irs @xmath50 and @xmath52 of the group @xmath46 .",
    "hence it follows that in antiferromagnetic state even and odd cooper pairs are possible .",
    "this general result agrees with the experimental data which show both even and odd symmetry for antiferromagnetic heavy - fermion superconductors @xmath71 and @xmath2 respectively [ 7 ] .",
    "the space - group approach to the wavefunction of a cooper pair makes it possible to investigate the nodal structure of sop as follows",
    ". one should consider the distinct directions and planes of symmetry in a one - electron brillouin zone and calculate the antisymmetrized kronecker squares with zero total momenta of double - valued irs or of double - valued corepresentations .",
    "the absence of any ir in this square indicates a node of the sop of this symmetry .",
    "there are two types of nodes .",
    "the intersection of the direction of nodes of any ir with the fermi surface results in the point node .",
    "the intersection of the plane of nodes with the fermi surface results in the line of nodes .",
    "possible irs for all states at the plain of symmetry ( group @xmath72 ) are presented in table 1 . in normal state",
    "all odd irs are present and one even ir @xmath73 of the group @xmath72 is absent in the decomposition .",
    "hence , it follows that in this case , only nodes of even order parameter on the planes of symmetry are required by the space - group symmetry and no limitations on odd irs exist .",
    "this statement is in agreement with the blount [ 17]blunt theorem according to which , _ it is vanishingly improbablefor triplet  superconductors to have curves of vanishing gap on the fermi surface_. if the time - reversal symmetry is violated , the antisymmetrized square of the double - valued ir equals to ir @xmath52 of the group @xmath72 .",
    "thus , in the ferromagnetic state , only odd irs are possible for the sop on the planes of symmetry .",
    "the lack of the second odd ir @xmath74 signifies that some of the odd irs of the point group are forbidden on the planes .",
    "the intersection of the plane with the fermi surface results in the line node of the odd sop .",
    "going over to the antiferromagnetic state we see in table 1 that one even ir @xmath50 ( the same as in normal state ) and one odd ir @xmath74 appear in the decomposition .",
    "hence it follows that the symmetry requirements for line nodes of even irs are the same as in normal state , but the lines of node of odd irs differ from that in ferromagnetic state .    hence it follows that the theory is in agreement with the above mentioned experimental on the sop symmetry in unconventional superconductors , i.e. antiferromagnetic superconductors may be either even ( singlet ) and odd ( triplet ) with lines of nodes .",
    "another reason for violation of blount theorem is due to crystal symmetry lower then @xmath75.@xmath76 and @xmath77 . in the case of @xmath75 symmetry spin function",
    "belong to three dimensional ir @xmath78 .",
    "following relation is valid for the kronecker product of the induced ir @xmath79 of the whole group :    @xmath80    hence we obtain that for @xmath75 symmetry all odd irs of the subgroup @xmath81 are possible for triplet pair and blount theorem is fulfilled . for @xmath82 and @xmath1",
    "symmetry the @xmath83=1 and -1 ( or @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) components belong to ir @xmath86 and @xmath83=0 ( or @xmath87 ) belong to ir @xmath88 .",
    "it is natural to expect that due to interactions of spins with crystal field the energies of spin states @xmath86 and @xmath89 are different and only one of them corresponds to superconducting state . since not all irs of group @xmath72 are present in the decomposition for both cases and the lines of nodes appear .",
    "thus another symmetry reason for violation of blount theorem is the lower crystal symmetry .",
    "table 1 .    the decomposition of representations @xmath90 and @xmath91    for the planes of symmetry ( group @xmath72 )    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     two dimensional irs appear twice for @xmath17 a general point in a brillouin zone .",
    "in this case a direct analysis of nodal structure of basis functions of table 2 is required .",
    "the analysis shows that basis functions of ir @xmath92 vanish in the planes@xmath93 and @xmath94 and that of ir @xmath95 vanish in the planes @xmath96 and @xmath97 linear combinations of these basis functions @xmath98 vanish in planes @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively and both vanish in plane @xmath94 .",
    "hence it follows that only lines of nodes in basal plane follow unambiguously from the symmetry .",
    "it should be noted , that point group  approach also results different nodal structure of different two - dimensional irs [ 19 ] .",
    "the analysis of broad set of experimental data on the of high - t@xmath101 superconductors [ 20 ] led the most of the authors to the conclusion of singlet pairing and @xmath50 sop symmetry in these compounds .",
    "angular resolved photoelectron spectra of high - t@xmath101 superconductors reveal a strong trough in the diagonal of @xmath102 plane indicating @xmath103 -pairing with line of nodes . on the other hand some experiments",
    "reveal also totally symmetric @xmath104 -pairing without nodes .",
    "in many cases an interplay between these two types of pairing [ 20 ] both belonging to @xmath50 ir exists .",
    "it is seen from table 2 , that @xmath50 pairing function , obtained group theoretically is noddles and that other irs have nodes in the coordinate planes only . hence it follows that nodal structure of high - t@xmath101 superconductors is more complex then that which follows from the symmetry only .",
    "to explain this one can consider two wave vectors @xmath105 and @xmath106 symmetrical with respect to diagonal of the deformed square .",
    "note , that the orthorombicity @xmath107 $ ] of @xmath108 is about 2 % only [ 20 ] .",
    "two types of basis functions of cooper pairs belonging to @xmath109 ir @xmath110 and @xmath111 are easily obtained from the table 2 by introducing additional subscripts @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "one can suppose that due to the interaction two self - vectors are linear combinations of these basis states :    @xmath112    @xmath113    both combinations belong to ir @xmath50 of group @xmath114 .",
    "first one corresponds to the noddles @xmath104-pairing and the second to the @xmath115pairing with line of nodes in the diagonal of @xmath102- plane . in the limit of zero orthorombic distortion",
    "the symmetry group is @xmath116 and @xmath117 , subscripts  @xmath42 and @xmath43 are dropped and the sums  in second brackets in right hand sides of ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) are written as @xmath118 . in this case combination ( 20 ) belongs to ir @xmath119 and combination ( 21 ) belongs to ir @xmath120 of the symmetry group @xmath116 .",
    "hence it follows that the nodal structure of sop in high- t@xmath101 superconductors is defined by hidden symmetry @xmath121",
    "it is clear from the shape of two - electron wavefunctions presented in table 2 that if the interaction within the @xmath4 manifold only , is anticipated , the energies of all irs of the same parity are the same .",
    "this statement contradicts with the experimental fact that the superconductivity in unconventional superconductors is defined by only one ir of crystal point group .",
    "hence it follows that we must suppose additional residual interaction , say between electrons connected by mirror reflection operation @xmath122 . in this case",
    "one should consider four electron state connected by space inversion , 180@xmath123 rotation and mirror reflection .",
    "we consider the the four -electron states which may be constructed on the basis of the singlet and triplet pairs in @xmath4 manifold , whose spatial part correspond to young tables @xmath124 $ ] and @xmath125 $ ] respectively . in general case it is done by a plethism operation [ 1 ] . in our case the induced structure of irs makes possible using of the mackey theorem as follows .",
    "the spatial parts of all singlet pairs are given by second term in the right hand side of ( 11 ) .",
    "all four electron states constructed from singlet pairs are contained in the kronecker product @xmath126 .",
    "due the induced structure of these representations one can use the mackey theorem ones more , taking any element except the space inversion as a coset representative . in this second step the symmetrized square of singlet spatial part is excluded , since it results the young table @xmath127 $ ] whose conjugate spin part @xmath128 $ ] is forbidden . taking 180@xmath123 rotation around axis perpendicular to the plane and mirror reflection as a coset representatives in double coset decomposition ( 3 ) we obtain all four electron states shown in figures 1 a ) and 1 b ) respectively .    in this figure the parity with respect to @xmath17 is indicated by the sign and the spin direction by an arrow .",
    "note that the young tables corresponding to both pictures are the same , but indexes 3 and 4 are interchanged in pictures .",
    "all these states are odd with respect to mirror reflection , but no limitations are imposed on the spin orientation of mirror counterparts .",
    "similar procedure can be applied to triplet pairs . in this case in the second step of application of mackey theorem one can make both symmetrization and antisymmetrization .",
    "but in the case of totally antisymmetric spatial part one obtains a four electron state with totally symmetrical spin part , i.e. with parallel spins .",
    "such a particle with total spin equals to 2 is not appropriate candidate for superconductivity and is excluded from the present consideration .",
    "the four electron states constructed from triplet pairs by symmetrization with respect to double coset defined by 180@xmath123 rotation and mirror reflection are shown in figures  2 a ) and 2 b ) respectively .",
    "these states belong to irs @xmath52 and @xmath74 of the group @xmath129 can have different parity with respect to mirror reflection .",
    "the electrons connected by mirror reflection have different spin directions in both cases .    the projection operator technique for two - electron states developed in the previous section results all even irs for singlet states and all odd irs for triplet case .",
    "when the four - electron states are constructed , the singlet states , even with respect to 180@xmath123 rotation are excluded .",
    "it should be noted that additional degeneration due to time reversal symmetry should be taken into account for two - electron states and we can apply or not apply time - reversal in addition to mirror reflection .",
    "it is seen from figure 2 that in `` triplet '' four - electron case we have only one possibility for spin orientation connected by mirror reflection .",
    "hence it follows that the total number of irs possible for four - electron quasiparticles is less then that in the case of two - electron quasiparticle .",
    "the method for construction of two- and four- electron wavefunction in solids based on mackey theorem on symmetrized squares of induced representations is developed .",
    "the nodal structure of two - electron states is investigated group theoretically .",
    "it is shown that lines of nodes always exist in a singlet case and appear in a triplet case if several symmetry operations are violated .",
    "it is shown that the main four - electron states ( related to both singlet and triplet pairs in @xmath4 manifold ) are described by young table @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "two advantages for introducing of four - electron states into the theory of superconductivity are emphasized .",
    "firstly they correspond to interactions beyond @xmath4 manifold and are able to explain different energies for different singlet and triplet irs .",
