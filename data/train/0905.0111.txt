    "the term ` dislocation ' is more established for defects in crystals , that is , imperfections in a regular periodic lattice geometry , which also occurs at points in two dimensions and on lines in three , and were originally proposed as a general feature of real crystal lattices in the 1950s @xcite . since then",
    ", the study of geometric topological defects has played a key role in condensed matter physics and beyond ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these defects are topological because their presence signifies a breakdown in a key geometric descriptor of a spatially extended field ( the order parameter ) , and a net change in that parameter in the vicinity of the defect , for instance on taking a circuit around it . for phase singularities , this is the strength : the phase change , quantized in units of @xmath0 around the node . for nodal points in two dimensions ,",
    "this gives a signed integer ( topological charge ) , whereas for lines in three dimensions , the sign endows the line with an orientation ( topological current ) : a natural direction for the tangent at each point along the nodal line .    a dislocation in a crystal lattice , on the other hand , are defined by its _",

    "it is thus a vector with integer components , the two most distinctive being an edge dislocation , whose burgers vector is perpendicular to the direction of the dislocation line ( all dislocations in 2-dimensional lattices are of this type ) , and a screw dislocation , whose burgers vector is parallel to the line s direction .",
    "examples of these two kinds are shown in figure [ fig : dislocation](a ) and ( b ) .    ) , with propagation directions @xmath1 given by the arrows .",
    ", width=377 ]    crystal and wave dislocations are described by different mathematical objects since the fields of which they are defects have different physical nature  a wave field , denoted here by @xmath2 is a smooth , complex function of position , and a crystal is a discrete lattice generated by specific lattice vectors .",
    "thus , does it make sense to define a burgers vector for a wave dislocation ?",
    "nye and berry s choice of nomenclature was motivated by specific , simple examples where dislocated waves have similarities to their crystal counterparts .",
    "specifically , they considered a time - independent wave function of the form @xmath3 with a node where @xmath4 ( giving a point at the origin in two dimensions , and a line along the @xmath5-axis in three ) .",
    "this is modulated by a plane wave with wavevector @xmath6 with @xmath1 in the @xmath7-plane ( say the @xmath8-direction ) , the pattern of constant phase lines resembles a crystal edge dislocation . in three dimensions ,",
    "if @xmath1 is parallel to @xmath9 the surfaces of constant phase are helicoids and resemble a screw .",
    "examples of these surfaces of constant phase in three dimensions are shown in figure [ fig : dislocation ] ( c , d ) .",
    "helical screw dislocations occur on the axis of optical beams carrying orbital angular momentum , such as laguerre - gauss modes @xcite .",
    "mixed edge - screw dislocations occur as intermediates .",
    "however , general wavefields , typified by superpositions of plane waves propagating in different directions , do not in general have an overall carrier wavevector , although they do have a complicated configuration of nodal points or lines .",
    "nevertheless , at points where the phase is not singular , it is natural to define the local wavevector as the local phase gradient @xcite . in quantum waves ,",
    "this definition is related to the concept of weak measurements ( i.e.  local rather than global averages ) @xcite .",
    "here , i will consider a general definition for the burgers vector of a wave dislocation , based on a regularized phase gradient at the phase singularity .",
    "this work extends my previous approach @xcite to the local phase structure of a wave dislocation .",
    "there , i considered several different measures for the rate of twist of the phase helicoids around a general dislocation line .",
    "this twist geometry is quite complicated , since the intensity contours in the plane transverse to a dislocation line are ellipses , with associated nonuniformity in phase @xcite , and generically this anisotropy ellipse rotates  ` twirls '  along the singular line , resulting in the different phase helicoids twisting at different rates .",
    "this was used to define an average rate of rotation , the ` ellipse - defined twist ' , of the phase core along a singularity line ( @xcite eq .",

    "i will show here that @xmath15 arises naturally as the tangential screw component of the wave dislocation s burgers vector , and find the corresponding transverse part .",
    "other measures considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , such as the azimuth - averaged twist @xmath16 ( the average rate of rotation of all phase surfaces along the singularity ) , and the screwness @xmath17 ( the rate of change of phase for fixed azimuth ) , appear as the tangential components of alternative definitions of the burgers vector .",
    "nye proposed @xcite a similar definition of the burgers vector for dislocations in time - dependent waves ( based on a generalization of @xmath18 ) , although it is difficult to generalize his definition to time - independent waves .",
    "in particular , his definition is based around a specific coordinate system attached to each point on the singularity , based on the tangent to the singularity and its perpendicular direction of motion .",
    "nye s burgers vector is then the limit of the phase gradient on approaching the singularity from these specific orthogonal directions ; when the dislocation is not moving , these directions can not be defined .",
    "the burgers vector defined in this paper is based on a local average of the phase gradient at points in a neighbourhood perpendicular to the dislocation line ; the sense of circulation around the phase vortex cancels out in this average , leaving the residual phase gradient which defines the burgers vector .",
    "the waves considered here will be time independent and monochromatic ( although these assumptions are not completely necessary ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the following section ,",
    "basic notions associated with phase gradient and phase singularities will be described , along with the quantum - style dirac notation required to write the burgers vector .",
    "the derivation and basic description of the burgers vector is given in section [ sec : burgers ] , culminating in its definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : burgers ] ) .",
    "the details of the calculation here is given in the appendix .",
    "readers interested only in the consequences of the definition may omit these sections .",
    "the direction of the burgers vector in the direction of the dislocation tangent  the screw component  determines the helicoidal twisting of the phase surfaces along the line , and this is related to the notion of helicity in fluid flows in section [ sec : screw ] .",
    "the remainder , a vector perpendicular to the singularity line , defines the edge component , is discussed in section [ sec : edge ] .",
    "in particular , the statistical distribution of the edge component in isotropic 2-dimensional monochromatic waves are explored numerically .",
    "the following discussion applies to a general complex scalar wavefunction @xmath19 with intensity @xmath20 and phase @xmath21 explicit dependence on position ( either in two or three dimensions ) will usually be omitted .",
    "wave dislocations are loci where @xmath22 on these points ( 2d ) or lines ( 3d ) , the intensity vanishes quadratically , and @xmath23 is undefined . as vortices , the dislocations are also circulations of the current associated with the wave , @xmath24 the wave burgers vector , defined in the next section , will be expressed in terms of various derivatives of the field close to the dislocation , which are described in this section .",

    "the burgers vector here defined might be related to the various phase gradient methods ( e.g.  @xcite ) proposed for the propagation dynamics of vortex points in paraxially propagating fields , which account for the transverse path of vortex points ( effectively the tangent direction in three dimensions ) by constructing a local phase gradient .",
    "such a direction is either perpendicular ( ` glide ' ) or parallel ( ` climb ' ) to the direction of the burgers vector ( nye and berry @xcite studied such phenomena in time - dependent fields ) , and such a comparison with the crystallographic case may provide new understanding of the propagation of optical singularities .",
