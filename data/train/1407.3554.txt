    "moreover , the genus of @xmath515 is the same as the total number of stabilizing arcs and detached longitudes that occur in @xmath514 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath514 is unstabilized and has no detached longitudes , then @xmath515 will be planar .",
    "thus a doppelgnger spoke graph @xmath514 can always be found which satisfies @xmath516 after attaching a sufficient number of stabilizing arcs and/or detached longitudes .    in part ( 1 ) of definition 3.14 , we have the flexibility to stabilize @xmath42 as often as we need , with stabilizing arcs based on radial edges of our choosing .",
    "this allows us to choose the number of stabilizing arcs that will eventually occur in the components of the spoke graph @xmath47 defined in part ( 2 ) of definition 3.14 .",
    "it follows from this and the previous paragraph that we may choose @xmath47 so that each of its components @xmath453 satisfies @xmath517 .",
    "as noted in remark 2.7 , the morse condition of definition 2.6 grants us enough flexibility to choose the radial edges on which the stabilizing arcs of @xmath259 ( the dual of @xmath42 ) will be based , and this in turn allows us to control the component of @xmath54 on which they will eventually occur in part ( 5 ) of definition 3.14 .",
    "likewise , we can choose the components of @xmath54 on which the detached longitudes of @xmath41 shall occur after the decomposition described in part ( 5 ) of definition 3.14 .",
    "so , similar to the case with @xmath47 , we may distribute detached longitudes and stabilizing arcs among the components of @xmath54 however we please .",
    "but there is an important difference : the total number of stabilizing arcs and detached longitudes that can occur in @xmath54 is bounded above by @xmath518 , where @xmath519 denotes the number of stabilizing arcs that occur in @xmath42 , and @xmath520 denotes the maximal number of detached longitudes that can occur on an admissible subgraph of @xmath259 ( as defined in part ( 4 ) of definition 3.14 ) .",
    "therefore , to complete the proof we must show that a total of @xmath518 stabilizing arcs and detached longitudes is always sufficient to create a spoke graph @xmath54 which satisfies the equation @xmath521 for each of its components @xmath466 .    as in part ( 5 ) of definition 3.14 ,",
    "let @xmath522 be the union of those components of @xmath120 which meet @xmath419 .",
    "by the first paragraph of this proof , the total number of stabilizing arcs and detached longitudes necessary to ensure that @xmath523 for all @xmath468 is equal to @xmath524 , where @xmath525 is the genus of @xmath467 .",
    "since @xmath526 for any connected , compact surface @xmath122 , we obtain    @xmath527    the fact that this quantity is less than @xmath518 is ultimately derived from the inequality    @xmath528    the truth of ( 2 ) can be seen as follows : @xmath529 is a generalized compression body with the same negative boundary as @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath530 is connected since @xmath531 is connected , as can be seen using essentially the same proof as that of lemma 3.7 .",
    "now @xmath532 is obtained from @xmath530 via surgeries along disks , and there must be at least @xmath533 such surgeries since @xmath530 is connected .",

    "thus from ( 2 ) we easily obtain the analogue @xmath539 . in conjunction with equation ( 1 ) , we obtain    @xmath540    our choice of @xmath47 has ensured that @xmath541 .",
    "we then compute @xmath542 , and so deduce    @xmath543    the detached longitudes of @xmath41 , as described in part ( 5 ) of definition 3.14 , all come from core curves of the annuli of @xmath459 which contain a component of @xmath544 . on the other hand , the number of prohibited annuli ( part ( 4 ) of definition 3.14 ) is equal to @xmath545 ( where @xmath406 denotes the set of annuli defined in part ( 2 ) of definition 3.14 ) .",
    "hence there will be at most @xmath546 detached longitudes which may occur in @xmath54 .",

    "our assumption that @xmath232 and @xmath28 are well - configured does not eliminate the possibility that @xmath599 .",
    "but in this case @xmath232 will be parallel to a component of @xmath600 , the thin part of @xmath28 , which implies the stronger conclusion @xmath601 .",
    "so we assume @xmath602 .",
    "let @xmath26 be a component of @xmath424 which meets @xmath419 , and let @xmath551 be its doppelgnger surface . by lemma 3.22 , for each component",
    "@xmath566 which is adjacent to @xmath26 , there is exactly one component @xmath570 of @xmath551 which is isotopic to a component @xmath571 of @xmath572 .",
    "since this isotopy fixes @xmath574 , it may be extended to an ambient isotopy of @xmath243 which fixes @xmath562 , and this ambient isotopy will push the remaining components of @xmath551 and the doppelgnger chamber @xmath481 of @xmath26 , into the complement of the doppelgnger chamber @xmath603 of @xmath566 in @xmath243 , thereby allowing @xmath603 and the remaining components of @xmath572 to be embedded in @xmath243 without meeting the deformed copies of @xmath551 and @xmath481 . call this ambient isotopy a _ flipping isotopy_. since",
    "any flipping isotopy leaves @xmath562 fixed , every disk embedded in the original version of the doppelgnger @xmath481 of @xmath26 is deformed to a disk which meets @xmath604 in the same way as the original .",
    "thus the deformed copy of @xmath481 still satisfies observation 3.15 and lemma 3.16 .",
    "thus , by performing and reversing flipping isotopies across the components of @xmath551 , we may simultaneously embed deformed , but topologically equivalent , versions of the doppelgnger surfaces and chambers of every component of @xmath424 that is adjacent to @xmath26 .",
    "this process of embedding can then be repeated for each of the components of @xmath424 that are adjacent to @xmath26 , and then to the components of @xmath424 which are adjacent to the components of @xmath424 that are adjacent to @xmath26 , and so on .",
    "this process will eventually terminate with the desired surface @xmath32 , and @xmath605 will be the disjoint union of ( harmlessly deformed versions of ) the doppelgnger chambers of those components of @xmath424 which meet @xmath419 .",
    "observation 3.15 then implies that @xmath606 is a generalized compression body .",
    "moreover , if @xmath155 is the union of all the ( deformed versions of ) the disk sets @xmath480 defined in lemma 3.16 , then lemma 3.16 implies that @xmath607 admits an ordering which makes it a primitive disk set for the ordered union of annuli @xmath608 ( see definition 1.4 and convention 3.5 ) with respect to the map @xmath609 ( see convention 3.9 ) .",
    "thus , if we let @xmath610 , and @xmath611 ( here @xmath612 as in observation 3.14 ) , then by proposition 1.6 , @xmath613 is also a generalized compression body .",
    "moreover , @xmath614 ( here @xmath615 ) satisfies the requirements of observation 1.2 , hence @xmath616 is also a generalized compression body .",
    "but if @xmath617 , then @xmath618 , so in fact @xmath619 is a generalized heegaard splitting of @xmath595 .",
    "moreover , since the doppelgnger surface @xmath32 was constructed from _ perfect _ spoke graphs as per definition 3.18 , the components of @xmath619 will all have exactly the same genus as the corresponding components of @xmath28 .",
    "it follows that @xmath619 will amalgamate to a heegaard surface of genus no higher than the surface which results from amalgamating @xmath28 .    for the sake of clarity",
    "is worth remarking that in the proof above we can not necessarily conclude that @xmath619 amalgamates to a surface of the _ same _ genus as the one which @xmath28 amalgamates to , because @xmath619 will have no components which correspond to any components of @xmath28 which lie entirely inside of @xmath363 . in the event that such components of @xmath28 do exist , it is easy to verify that @xmath619 will amalgamate to a surface of strictly lower genus",
    ". it is also perhaps worth pointing out that , since the core @xmath620 of @xmath243 can be embedded in @xmath621 , we can stabilize @xmath619 once ( if necessary ) to obtain a generalized heegaard splitting of @xmath622 of genus at most @xmath623 .",
    "this allows us to deduce the following corollary .    if @xmath28 amalgamates to a minimal genus heegaard surface of @xmath175 , then @xmath624 .",
    "if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are knots in @xmath15 , then @xmath1 .    the proposition is trivial if one of @xmath17 or @xmath18 is the unknot , so suppose that both are non - trivial knots .",
    "assume also that @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath232 be the `` swallow - follow '' torus in @xmath625 which swallows the @xmath18 summand and follows the @xmath17 summand ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "we apply theorem 3.23 by setting @xmath626 , noting that one component of @xmath627 is homeomorphic to @xmath628 , which will correspond to @xmath363 .",
    "what needs to be shown is that the untelescoped minimal splitting @xmath28 can be isotoped so that it meets @xmath232 only in essential simple closed curves , and such that each component of @xmath629 is separating .    by its definition as a swallow - follow torus ,",
    "@xmath232 is isotopic to @xmath630 , where @xmath55 is the decomposing annulus of the connected sum in @xmath626 , and @xmath181 the sub - annulus of @xmath631 which lies in the component of @xmath632 corresponding to @xmath628 . by proposition 1.21",
    ", @xmath28 can be isotoped to intersect @xmath55 only in essential simple closed curves , and since each boundary component of @xmath629 is then a standard meridional curve of @xmath633 , every component of @xmath629 is separating in @xmath628 ( otherwise we could obtain a non - separating surface in @xmath15 ) .",
    "the hypotheses of theorem 3.23 ( which assume conventions 3.1 , 3.3 , and 3.9 ) can then be satisfied by isotoping @xmath232 sufficiently close to @xmath630 .",
    "now @xmath596 is the component of @xmath627 which is _ not _ homeomorphic to @xmath628 , but is instead homeomorphic to @xmath634 , where @xmath635 is the link in @xmath15 which has @xmath18 as one component , and a meridian @xmath636 of @xmath18 as its other component , and @xmath637 under this correspondence ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "furthermore , the slope in which @xmath28 has been made to intersect @xmath638 is the standard longitudinal slope determined by the meridian disk @xmath639 with @xmath640 and @xmath641 .",
    "thus the slope of the trivial dehn filling of @xmath642 which yields @xmath643 meets each component of @xmath644 exactly once , and theorem 3.23 applies to @xmath645 , yielding @xmath646     ( in yellow ) is seen as situated in @xmath647 , and @xmath364 is indicated with dashed lines lying on the `` swallow - follow '' torus @xmath232 . in the second diagram",
    ", @xmath596 is reimbedded in @xmath648 , and in the final diagram we see @xmath596 and @xmath364 as they look after inverting the image of @xmath232 under this reimbedding.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    this proof also works if the knots @xmath17 and @xmath18 are embedded in homology spheres ( or any pair of compact @xmath0-manifolds in which every closed embedded surface is separating ) . in general , however , it is important to keep in mind the delicacy theorem 3.23 ( and corollary 3.25 ) , whose assumptions are encoded in conventions 3.1 , 3.3 and 3.9 . in particular ,",
    "the assumption of convention 3.3 that @xmath232 and @xmath28 are well - configured can not always be satisfied , as can be shown using straightforward examples in @xmath649 , where @xmath122 is a closed genus @xmath650 surface .",
    "thus corollary 3.25 can not be applied to prove the following plausible conjecture in the case @xmath651 in any obvious way .",
    "suppose @xmath175 is a compact @xmath0-manifold and @xmath232 is a separating , incompressible , orientable , genus @xmath652 surface properly embedded in @xmath175 .",
    "if @xmath363 and @xmath596 are the components of @xmath627 , then @xmath653 .",
    "similarly , the need for @xmath232 and @xmath28 to be well - configured is what keeps us from applying theorem 3.23 and corollary 3.25 to prove the analogue of theorem 4.1 for satellite knots .",
    "theorem 4.1 has some relation to the `` rank - genus conjecture '' for knot complements in @xmath15 . if we define @xmath654 to be the minimal number of generators for @xmath655 , then the rank - genus conjecture states :    for all knots @xmath5 , @xmath656 .    since a genus @xmath652 heegaard splitting of a knot complement induces a @xmath652-generator presentation of @xmath655 , it is clear that @xmath657 , but it remains unknown whether it is possible for this inequality to be strict .",
    "the rank - genus conjecture for closed @xmath0-manifolds is known to be false @xcite , even when restricted to the class of hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the rank - genus conjecture also fails for knot complements , and a pair of knots in @xmath15 whose tunnel number degenerated enough to violate theorem 4.1 would have given a counterexample , since the following analogue of theorem 4.1 for rank is trivial ( thanks to richard weidmann for pointing out the simple line of proof below ) .",
    "@xmath658 for any knots @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath659 is an amalgamated free product @xmath660 which retracts onto each of its factors .",
    "the fact that theorem 4.1 is true indicates that the class of knot pairs which experience high tunnel number degeneration is not a good place to look for counterexamples to the rank - genus conjecture after all .",
    "it might even be seen as a small vote in favor of the possibility that the rank - genus conjecture is valid for knot complements in @xmath15 .",
