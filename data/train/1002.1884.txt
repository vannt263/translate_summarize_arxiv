    "ever since the seminal work by matsui and satz @xcite , @xmath1 has been investigated for a long time as a diagnostic tool to probe the properties of hot nuclear matter created in the early stages of a relativistic heavy ion collision .",
    "the original claim stated that @xmath1 can not be formed in the quark - gluon plasma(qgp ) due to color screening between the charm and anti - charm quark and that such mechanism will lead to the suppression of @xmath1 production in a heavy ion collision if the qgp is formed .",
    "however , the situation was found to be more involved as recent lattice qcd results showed that @xmath1 might survive past the critical temperature ( @xmath3 and dissolve only at a higher temperature ( @xmath4)@xcite .",
    "if so , it is important to know the detailed temperature dependencies of the properties of the @xmath1 above @xmath5 , as large thermal width for example might still lead to a very small survival rate of the @xmath1@xcite . moreover , if the quark - gluon plasma is formed and the number of charm quarks are large , there is an additional production mechanism that has to be estimated and comes from the formation of @xmath1 through the regeneration of charm and anti - charm that are well described by statistical approaches@xcite . a successful phenomenological model that is able to explain the @xmath1 signals coming from p+p to heavy ion collisions at high energy should consistently include all the above mentioned ingredients .    the commonly measured and calculated nuclear modification factor @xmath0 shows whether the @xmath1 is suppressed or enhanced in the heavy ion collision @xcite .",
    "for instance , if @xmath6 , the number of produced @xmath1 in a+a collision is equal to the number of produced @xmath1 in p+p collision at the same energy , times the number of binary collisions of nucleons from the two colliding nuclei . if @xmath7 , the number of @xmath1 dissolved in hot nuclear matter is larger ( smaller ) than that regenerated from the quark - gluon plasma at the hadronization point .",
    "presently @xmath0 of @xmath1 is below unity up to the maximum energy of rhic .",
    "@xcite .",
    "phenomenological models have been developed to describe @xmath0 of @xmath1 from sps to rhic , and to predict the upcoming lhc heavy ion data .",
    "one of the successful models to explain the heavy ion data is the thermal model @xcite . here",
    "the @xmath1 production follows the statistical description at the chemical freeze out point , and thus can be thought of as being regenerated from the quark - gluon plasma at the hadronization point ( @xmath8 ) . in the so called two - component model by grandchamp and rapp(gr ) @xcite , one additionally takes into account the fact that the @xmath1 survives past @xmath5 and dissociates only at a higher temperature @xmath9 so that some of @xmath1 produced at initial stage survives the high temperature phase and reaches the final stage ; these together with those regenerated from the quark - gluon plasma at the hadronization point constitutes the two components of the observed @xmath1 @xcite . in a third model the continuous dissociation and regeneration of @xmath1",
    "is calculated using the boltzman transport equation from @xmath9 to @xmath5 evolved using the hydrodynamics equation @xcite .",
    "crucial quantities in the above models are the @xmath9 s for the charmonia ; these are the melting temperatures for the deby screened coulomb type of charmonium bound states above @xmath5 . while , initial calculations seemed to suggest that @xmath10 for @xmath1 and lower for the excited states@xcite",
    ", recent studies claim that these could be lower due to the large thermal width the states acquire @xcite . the current experimental error for @xmath0 of @xmath1 as a function of the number of participants are still too large to draw any definite conclusions about these different temperatures .",
    "however , one finds interesting characteristics if one takes the central values of the experimental data for the curve of au+au collision at @xmath2 gev ; there seems to be two sudden drops @xcite .",
    "one occurs initially at a very small number of participants and the other somewhere between 170 and 210 . assuming that the initial temperatures of the fireball is correlated to the number of participants , the two drops might be related to two distinct initial temperatures .",
    "indeed , as we will show in our two component model , the first sudden drop at small number of participants can be related to the dissociation of excited charmonia such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; the initial dissociation of these states will suppress the expected 30 to 40% feedback production of @xmath1 from its excited states .",
    "the second sudden drop is found to be related to the initial dissociation of @xmath1 . in geometrical terms , the first drop occurs when there appears regions where the initial temperature is larger than the @xmath9 of the excited charmonia , and the second drop when it is larger than @xmath9 of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , if the thermal decay width of @xmath1 is not so large , these effects become prominent .    in this work ,",
    "we generalize the two - component model to take into account the initial hot region mentioned above , and calculate the @xmath0 of @xmath1 at midrapidity in au+au collision at @xmath2 gev .",
    "we estimate the initial local temperature with the assumption that local entropy density is simply the linear combination of number density of the number of participants and of binary collision , a formula that well reproduce the multiplicities of charged particles at chemical freeze - out stage in the scenario of isentropically expanding fireball .",
    "the average temperature of the fireball is obtained from equating the entropy density to that of the quark - gluon plasma calculated using a non interacting gas of quarks and gluons with effective thermal masses extracted from lattice qcd calculation for the energy density and pressure @xcite .",
    "the baryon chemical potential is obtained from the ratio of the proton and the antiproton , and other chemical potentials from the conservation of respective flavors .    in the two - component model , the primordial charmonia , which have not evolved to the final charmonia yet , first undergo nuclear absorption .",
    "then after they form into the initially produced charmonia , they undergo through thermal decay in the quark - gluon plasma , and then hadronic decay in the hadron gas until the chemical freeze - out stage . on the other hand ,",
    "the regenerated charmonia only go through the hadronic decay in the hadron gas . consequently ,",
    "another important quantity in the model is the thermal widths of charmonia in the quark - gluon plasma and in hadron gas .",
    "we improve previous calculations by using the results obtained using perturbative qcd up to the next to leading order ( nlo ) in the coupling constant@xcite . in our work , this coupling constant is not a free parameter , because it is related to the screening mass of quark - gluon plasma and sequential melting temperatures of charmonia .",
    "the details is mentioned in chapter vii .",
    "the relaxation factor of charm quarks in quark - gluon plasma is calculated up to leading order in perturbative qcd ; this factor determines the fraction of thermalized charm quarks and used to estimate the regeneration of charm quarks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss nuclear absorption and introduce the necessary concepts . in section iii , we introduce the initial local temperature profile . in section iv",
    ", we show how the thermodynamic parameters are determined . in section",
    "v and vi we respectively discuss the thermal decay and regeneration of charmonia . in the last two sections ,",
    "we give the results and conclusions . in the appendix",
    ", we summarize the perturbative nlo formula for the dissociation cross section of charmonium .",
    "within the glauber model , heavy ion collision can be described with collisions of the nucleons .",
    "the model has two important scales , the number of participants and the number of binary collisions .",
    "participants mean the nucleons in both colliding nuclei that go through inelastic scattering at least once .",
    "the rest are called spectators .",
    "usually the amount of bulk matter created from heavy ion collision is proportional to the number of participants .",
    "the number of binary collisions counts only primary collisions of two nucleons .",
    "usually hard particle such as the charmonium is produced through primary collision , because it requires large energy transfer ; hence , its production number is proportional to the number of binary collisions .",
    "the two numbers are calculated in glauber model as follows @xcite :    @xmath13 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & b\\int d^2s t_b(\\vec{b}-\\vec{s})\\bigg[1-\\{1-t_a(\\vec{s})\\sigma_{in}\\}^a\\bigg ] \\nonumber\\\\ n_{coll}(\\vec{b})&=&\\sigma_{in}ab \\int d^2 s t_a(\\vec{s } ) t_b(\\vec{b}-\\vec{s})\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & \\sigma_{in}ab~ t_{ab}(\\vec{b } ) , \\label{two - scales}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the impact parameter of the two colliding heavy nuclei , and a , b are their mass numbers .",
    "@xmath15 is the inelastic cross section of two nucleons , which is about @xmath16 at @xmath2 gev @xcite .",

    ", @xmath20 is the distribution function of one nucleon in nucleus a(b ) , for which we use the following woods - saxon model : @xmath21 for the au nucleus , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath23 is determined by the requirement @xmath24 .",
    "the charm and anticharm quark pair produced through primary collision is called the primordial charmonia before they form into on shell states .",
    "such primordial charmonia can still be absorbed by nucleons passing through it .",
    "the survival rate at transverse position @xmath25 from the nuclear absorption is    @xmath26    here , @xmath27 is the absorption cross section of primordial charmonia by a nucleon , and is about @xmath28 at @xmath2 gev @xcite . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the positions where the primordial charmonium is created in beam direction from the center of nucleus a and from the center of nucleus b respectively . the second line in eq .",
    "( [ absorption ] ) is the absorption factor by nucleus a , and the third by nucleus b. mass number a and b in the exponents of the second and third line are both subtracted by 1 , because one nucleon of nucleus a and one nucleon of nucleus b take part in producing a charm pair , and can not take part in absorbing the pair .",
    "to build up a model for the suppression , we will closely follow the space time picture of nucleus nucleus collision generally accepted from a hydrodynamic simulations@xcite .",
    "after the heavy ions pass through each other , hot nuclear matter is created with small net baryon density between the two receding nuclei .",
    "the hot matter is expected to thermalize early ; while the exact thermalization time could be controversial , we will just take the typical time accepted in hydrodynamic simulation given as @xmath31fm / c@xcite .",
    "the total entropy produced in heavy ion collision is estimated from the multiplicity of produced particles .",
    "the multiplicity of charged particles near midrapidity was found to be well described under the assumption that it is proportional to a linear combination of the number of participants and the number of binary collisions .",
    "because both the multiplicity of particles and the entropy are extensive thermal quantities , it is assumed that the entropy per pseudorapidity is also proportional to the same linear combination of number of participants and binary collisions as the particle multiplicity .",
    "@xmath32    in the linear combination for multiplicities of charged particles , @xmath33 is 0.09 at @xmath34 gev and 0.11 at @xmath2 gev ; the same values are used for entropy @xcite .",
    "the overall factor of 30.3 is determined so that multiplicities of charged particles are well reproduced under the condition that the ratio between entropy and multiplicity is determined from the statistical model at the chemical freeze out point ; @xmath35 , where @xmath36 @xmath37 are the total entropy and multiplicity ( density ) respectively . the upper figure of fig .",

    "near midrapidity , the rapidity is approximated to the longitudinal velocity , @xmath44 and is further assumed to be equal to the pseudorapidity .",
    "supposing that the rapidity interval of interest is @xmath45 , the total entropy within the interval is @xmath46 . ignoring longitudinal acceleration , longitudinal size of nuclear matter within @xmath45 is @xmath47 at thermalization time @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , entropy density at thermalization time is    @xmath48    where a is the transverse area .",
    "the equation of state is required to extract the temperature from the entropy density . in the quasi - particle picture ,",
    "the strongly interacting massless particles are replaced by the noninteracting massive particles , whose properties are determined from the condition that they reproduce the thermal quantities such as energy density and pressure of the strongly interacting massless particles .",
    "the thermal quantities of strongly interacting quarks and gluons are simulated by lattice qcd . in this work",
    ", we will use the parametrization for the effective thermal masses of quark and gluon extracted by levai and heinz from lattice qcd data for pure gauge , for @xmath49 and for @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "they fix the degrees of freedom of quarks and gluon to those in the vacuum , and use the forms of lo perturbative qcd for their masses , parameterizing the the nonperturbative effects into a temperature dependent coupling @xmath51 :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 @xmath54 , 140 , 170 mev and @xmath55 , 1.03 , 1.05 for pure gauge , @xmath49 and @xmath50 cases respectively . here",
    "we choose the case of @xmath50 for thermal masses , because its critical temperature is more reasonable than that of @xmath49 .    with these effective thermal masses and the equation of state obtained by assuming a gas of weakly interacting quarks and gluons , the entropy density is related to temperature as given below , @xmath56 the entropy density of quark - gluon plasma has a term proportional to the derivative of the squared thermal mass with respect to temperature , because thermal masses depend on temperature .",
    "but the term is to be canceled by the term induced from bag pressure to maintain thermodynamic consistency @xcite .",
    "the summation @xmath57 includes gluon and quark of three flavors , although the lattice data is extracted for @xmath50 , we use the realistic number of flavors to get a more realistic magnitude for the entropy .",

    "the hot nuclear matter created through a heavy ion collision expands in time ; assuming isentropic expansion , the entropy density and the temperature decreases along with it .",
    "once the critical temperature is reached , the phase of the matter changes from quark - gluon plasma to the hadron gas .",
    "it is known that the phase transition is a crossover at small baryon chemical potential and that there is a critical point where the phase transition changes from a crossover to the first order as baryon chemical potential increases . while the exact location of the point is not certain yet , the phase transition is expected to be still at the rapid crossover region at rhic and at lhc energies .",
    "the statistical model is very successful in reproducing the observed particle ratios with two free parameters : the temperature and the baryon chemical potential at the chemical freeze - out stage .",

    "these upper limits for the hadron masses are taken such that inclusion of hadrons with masses higher than the upper bounds will not change the result ; for example , if the upper limit of meson mass is set at 2.0 gev , much more mesons are to be included , but their contribution is small .",

    "one of them is the difference in kinetic energies of partons .",
    "the kinetic energy of a parton has to be larger than the binding energy of the charmonium states for the break up to take place .",
    "such energy are readily available for massive quarks and gluons at finite temperature . however , for pions , the temperatures have to be higher .",

    "@xmath141 is the hot region where initial temperature is over the dissociation temperature of each charmonia .",
    "as discussed before , results from hydrodynamics suggest that hot nuclear matter created in relativistic heavy ion collision is thermalized very fast .",

    "if the number of charm and anti - charm quarks are also thermalized , the total number of charm pairs produced @xmath142 from the collision of nucleus a and b would satisfy the following equation @xcite :    @xmath143    here , @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the number density of open and hidden charms respectively , and @xmath66 is the volume of hot nuclear matter ; all are a function of the proper time @xmath146 .    in general , if creation or annihilation of charm pairs is considered during the expansion of hot nuclear matter , the number of charm quark pairs will be a function of proper time @xmath146 .",

    "the survival rate of charmonium is 0 , while for the effect coming from thermal decay , it depends on the temperature and lifetime of the qgp relevant for thermal decay .",

    "the temperature region near @xmath5 is more important , which last almost 2 to 3 fm / c .",
    "this means that the thermal width has to be of the order 100 mev to have an appreciable suppression effect .",
    "therefore , there will be a critical change in the survival rate depending on whether or not the initial temperature is larger than the dissociation temperature ; because that condition corresponds to having either an infinite or finite thermal width .",
    "this critical change in survival rate will appear as a sudden change of @xmath0 along the axis of number of participants , because the initial temperature rises as the number of participants increases .",
    "therefore , if at some future point , the error bars in the experimental data are reduced and one indeed finds the sudden kink , it would strongly imply that the @xmath1 dissociation takes place at the corresponding point .",
    "moreover , an initial kink could appear when the initial temperature is higher than the dissociation temperatures of excited charmonia , such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it should be kept in mind however that when the thermal decay width is in the order of few hundred mev just above the deconfinement , the sudden kink could also have occurred due to the thermal decay .",

    "in contrast to the case at rhic energy , the survival rate from thermal decay is very low and the regeneration effect is dominant except in the peripheral collision .",
    "this is so because the lifetime of quark - gluon plasma is much longer than at rhic .",
    "according to our rough estimation , the lifetime at the most central collision is twice that of the rhic case .",
    "the long lifetime of quark - gluon plasma suppresses the survival rate of charmonia through thermal decay and enhances the relaxation factor @xmath171 of charm and anti - charm quarks .",
    "abundance of charm quarks is another reason for the dominance of the regeneration effect .",
    "the same method seems to be applicable to lower collision energies such as sps . in this case",
    ", however , the baryon chemical potential is too high to make use of effective thermal masses by levai and heniz , which are extracted from the lattice qcd data with zero baryon chemical potential .",
    "we introduce a generalized two - component model to calculate the @xmath0 of @xmath1 near midrapidity in au+au collision at @xmath161 gev . in the model ,",
    "suppression is caused by the nuclear absorption of primordial charmonia and by the thermal decay of charmonia in the quark - gluon plasma and in the hadron gas .",
    "enhancement is caused by the regeneration from the qgp .",
    "one of our emphases is the use of a consistent perturbative qcd approach , up to next to the leading order , to estimate the thermal decay widths of charmonia both in the quark - gluon plasma and in the hadron gas . while the coupling is considered to be a free parameter to be determined by experiment , it is also related to the screening mass and subsequently dissociation temperatures of charmonia in screened cornell potential model .",
    "another emphasis of our approach is the initial temperature profile which leads to initial suppression of charmonia if the local temperature is higher than the dissociation temperature .",
    "when the initial temperature profiles , and thus the initial hot regions are considered , the calculated @xmath0 seems to show two sudden drops ; one at very small number of participants and the other at around @xmath215 .",
    "the first sudden drop of @xmath0 at very small number of participants is caused when the maximum temperature of hot nuclear matter reaches above the dissociation temperatures of excited charmonia and the second sudden drop when it reaches the dissociation temperature of @xmath1 . on the other hand , if the thermal width of @xmath1 is large compared to the inverse time scale of the qgp , the second sudden drop of @xmath0 disappears .",
    "moreover , some effects can cancel other effects .",
    "for example , a increased thermal width of @xmath1 will reduce the @xmath0 , while a decreased mass of @xmath1 will enhance it .",
    "the present experimental data from rhic are still large to discriminate all the different and competing mechanisms discussed here .",
    "however , the central values seem to be consistent with the two drops . in this sense",
    ", the maximum temperature of sps seems to be lower than the melting temperature of @xmath1 , because the second drop is not seen in @xmath0 there @xcite .",
    "similar conclusion could also be made from the data for the cu+cu collision at @xmath161 gev .",
    "however refined data for the au+au collision at @xmath161 gev are required to make a definite conclusion . moreover fitting a single data",
    "can not disentangle all the different suppression mechanisms separately . in that sense , the @xmath0 of @xmath1 at lhc energy should provide a very interesting information .",
    "as shown in our rough estimate , @xmath0 at lhc is very different from that at rhic , in that it is dominated by the regenerated @xmath1 from the qgp .",
    "moreover , within the thermal decay width given in the paper , the life time of the plasma seems to be much longer than the inverse of the thermal decay with .",
    "hence , initially formed @xmath1 will be mostly suppressed through thermal decay .",
    "therefore , the upcoming lhc experiment will provide a totally new information about @xmath1 in relativistic heavy ion collision and thus the nature of qgp and its formation .",
