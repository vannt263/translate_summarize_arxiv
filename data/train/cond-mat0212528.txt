    "quantized vorticity which accompanies rotational motion is a characteristic feature of superfluids .",

    "condensates containing up to 4 vortices were observed .",
    "their method can be understood in analogy with fluid motion in a rotating vessel .",
    "the idea of a rotating trap has been employed by many groups thereafter .",

    "however , the experimentally recorded image of the cloud of atoms does not show any indications for the splitting of multiply quantized vortices .",
    "this surprising apparent stability contradicts with what has been widely expected  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is urgent to understand the stability of these off - centered vortices and the multiply quantized vortices .",
    "the axisymmetric and rotationally symmetric ( singly quantized ) vortex states have been studied and a core - localized excitation with negative excitation energy is found  @xcite . concerning this excitation , a relation to the instability of a vortex state  @xcite ( through the transfer of the population from the condensate mode to the core - localized excitation ) and also to the precession motion  @xcite of the vortex core",

    "nevertheless , the axisymmetric and rotationally symmetric systems only mimic the experimental situations because ( a ) the axisymmetric vortex state can become a vortexfree state only through the off - centered vortex states .",
    "( b ) a system with a vortex under precessional motion is no longer axisymmetric .",
    "the understanding of the excitation level with negative energy involves a puzzling feature  @xcite because the value is connected to both the direction and frequency of the precession motion and the instability of the vortex state .",

    "therefore , investigations of the off - centered vortex state are necessary in order to understand both the instability and the precessional motion .",

    "the motivation for an analysis of non - axisymmetric doubly quantized vortex may be explained in a similar way : the instability of the doubly quantized vortex state has been pointed out for the rotationally symmetric vortex state  @xcite .",
    "it relates the existence of a mode with a complex excitation energy and its exponential increase of population .",
    "but the axisymmetric state only lasts for an infinitesimal time if the vortex is unstable .",
