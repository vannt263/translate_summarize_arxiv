    "the long - standing hunt for the inhomogenous superconducting state predicted by fulde and ferrell @xcite and by larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite ( the so - called fflo state ) has recently known a revival in the study of fermionic cold atoms @xcite , quantum chromodynamics color superconductivity @xcite and heavy fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the fflo phase consists in a condensate of finite momentum cooper pairs in contrast to the zero momenta pairs of the usual bcs state .",
    "hence the fflo superconducting order parameter acquires a spatial variation .",
    "such a state may be induced when a chemical potential difference is applied between two species of fermions with mutual pairing attraction .    in superconductors",
    "the different chemical potentials are obtained by a zeeman splitting @xmath4 between spin up and down states , @xmath5 and @xmath6 being respectively the bohr magneton and an external magnetic field ( in magnetic superconductors @xmath7 is the internal exchange field ) .",
    "a characteristic feature of the field - temperature phase diagram is the existence of a tricritical point ( tcp ) which is the meeting point of three transition lines separating the normal metal , the uniform superconductor and the fflo state . for clean @xmath8-wave superconductors",
    "the tcp is located at @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the zero field critical temperature .",
    "unfortunately , the fflo state is only energetically favorable in a small part of the phase diagram , located at low temperatures @xmath12 and high fields , see fig.[fig_phase_diagram ] . up to now",
    ", there is no compelling experimental evidence for this mysterious fflo phase although some heavy fermion superconductors like cecoin@xmath0 @xcite , organic superconductors like @xmath1-(bets)@xmath2fecl@xmath3 @xcite , and rare - earth magnetic superconductors like errh@xmath3b@xmath3 @xcite are promising candidates .    in the neighborhood of the tcp",
    ", the fflo transition may be described within a modified ginzburg - landau approach ( mgl ) .",
    "the mgl free energy functional , which follows from bcs theory with zeeman pair breaking , was first obtained for @xmath8-wave superconductors @xcite and then generalized to @xmath13-wave pairing with / without impurities @xcite .",
    "the salient features of the mgl functional are the presence of higher order derivatives of the order parameter @xmath14 than the usual @xmath15 term , and the fact that the coefficient @xmath16 of the latter term changes sign at the tcp being positive for @xmath17 and negative otherwise . when the stiffness @xmath16 becomes negative , the spatially varying configurations of the order parameter are favored leading to the fflo transition . as a result of",
    "the anisotropy contained in higher order derivatives , the degeneracy over the fflo modulation is removed even in the cubic lattice .",
    "another source of anisotropy is related to momentum - dependent pairing . in the case of a @xmath13-wave",
    "pauli limited superconductor both lattice and pairing anisotropies are of primary importance for the fflo @xcite .    beside these mean - field studies ,",
    "the fluctuations have rarely been considered in the context of the fflo transition , although they may be accounted for in a quite simple and accurate manner within the framework of the mgl . using the standard ginzburg - landau functional , the effect of fluctuations on the properties of the normal state were extensively studied for the homogeneous bcs superconductors @xcite and high-@xmath18 superconductors @xcite . though relatively small , thermodynamical and transport properties were actually measured in the gaussian regime .    up to now , a detailed investigation of the fluctuations near the fflo transition was missing . a first attempt to fill this flaw",
    "was realized recently by marenko and samokhin who addressed the issue of the quantum critical fluctuations at the zero temperature fflo transition @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform the complementary investigation of the fluctuations in the neighborhood of the tricritical point .    in this letter , we study the effect of the fluctuations close to the fflo transition .",
    "we focus on the specific heat @xmath19 and on the excess conductivity @xmath20 , the so - called paraconductivity , induced by the superconducting fluctuations within the normal state .",
    "we have identified three regimes in the vicinity of the tricritical point @xmath21 which differ by the nature of the soft fluctuation modes .    within the first regime , depicted as region i in fig.[fig_phase_diagram ] ,",
    "the soft modes have the usual quadratic dispersion and are located around the origin of momentum space .",
    "this familiar situation yields the well - established power law behaviors @xmath22 reviewed in @xcite .     phase diagram around the tricritical point @xmath23 .",
    "the solid lines represent the transitions between the normal metal , the spatially uniform bcs superconductor , and the non uniform fflo state . in region",
    "i where @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "region ii where @xmath25 ) , the normal state behavior is dominated by uniform ( resp .",
    "non uniform ) superconducting modes which propagate quadratically . in region",
    "iii where @xmath26 , the preponderant fluctuations propagate as @xmath27 .",
    "region iii is defined by @xmath28 there are also crossover regimes ( cr ) separating the region iii from i and ii .",
    ", width=288 ]    in contrast , the second regime represented as region ii in fig.[fig_phase_diagram ] , is characterized by anomalous power laws in isotropic or weakly anisotropic materials .",
    "here anomalous simply means distinct from @xmath22 .",
    "this discrepancy is related to the fact that the minima of the dispersion are attained on a finite dimensional surface , a sphere or a ring , see fig.[fig_crossovers].@xmath29 .",
    "hence the available phase space volume of the low energy fluctuations is larger than in the case of the standard bcs transition towards a uniform ground state , as it was first pointed out by brazovski @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , among the host of promising candidates for the fflo state , crystal or gap symmetry effects are important .",
    "in such case the sphere or ring containing the low energy modes is partially removed and the low energy fluctuations are located within small islands centered at a few number of isolated points in momentum space , as it is shown in fig.[fig_crossovers].@xmath30 . thus for large anisotropy , the anomaly disappears and one recovers the usual power laws @xmath31 . in summary the exponents in regime",
    "ii depend drastically on the anisotropy of the system .",
    "the most interesting regime , region iii of fig.[fig_phase_diagram ] is at the immediate vicinity of the tcp where the fflo and the uniform superconducting phases compete .",
    "the power laws of the specific heat @xmath32 and paraconductivity @xmath33 are anomalous and quite universal since they pertain in both isotropic and anisotropic models .",
    "these predictions rely on the fact that the dispersion of the soft fluctuation modes becomes quartic within this regime .",
    "indeed , these three regimes and the related crossovers between them may serve as a powerfull tool to identify fflo state .",
    "we investigate the fluctuation properties at the transition between normal and fflo states using a quite general approach based on the mgl functional @xcite .",
    "note that we assume a second order phase transition to the fflo state . in the framework of isotropic model",
    "this transition is of second order for one and two dimensional systems while it is of first order in three dimensional case @xcite .",
    "however in the real superconductors the crystalline anisotropy ( even a cubic one ) is of primary importance and can modify this conclusion .",
    "nevertheless , we may expect that in the case of weakly first order fflo transition , the fluctuation regimes studied here would be still observable .",
    "such description is adequate near the tricritical point where the most striking behavior is expected and where the wave - vector of the fflo modulation is small .",
    "looking for gaussian fluctuations in the normal state it is sufficient to consider mgl functional only in the quadratic @xmath34 approximation @xmath35   = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}\\text { } \\underset{i , j=1}{% % tcimacro{\\dsum ^{d}}% % beginexpansion { \\displaystyle\\sum^{d } } % endexpansion } \\left (   \\alpha+gk_{i}^{2}+\\gamma_{ij}k_{i}^{2}k_{j}^{2}\\right )   \\left\\vert \\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}\\right\\vert ^{2 } \\label{eq_our_model}%\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are the fourier components of the complex order parameter and @xmath13 the dimensionality of the sample .",
    "the coefficient @xmath37 , the coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath38 depend on the magnetic field and temperature , @xmath39 being the critical temperature for the second order transition between normal and uniform superconducting states .",
    "although qualitative conclusions are quite general , explicit calculations are performed within the cubic anisotropy model defined by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "the case @xmath42 corresponds to the isotropic model since then the general fluctuation spectrum @xmath43 @xmath44 depends only on @xmath45 and on @xmath46 .",
    "hence @xmath47 is a measure of the deviation from the ideally isotropic material with a spherical fermi surface .    integrating out the gaussian modes @xmath36",
    ", one obtains the fluctuation free energy density @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the size of the system .",
    "the specific heat may be readily deduced from the free energy ( [ free ] ) via @xmath50 in evaluating the paraconductivity within the kubo formalism , one should use the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation to obtain the current - current correlator at different times@xcite . moreover attention",
    "should be paid to the fact that , owing to the presence of high order derivatives @xmath51 in eq.([free ] ) , the expression for the current operator differs from the usual one .",
    "however the general expression@xcite relating the paraconductivity to the fluctuation spectrum,@xmath52 still holds for the fflo case although expressions for the velocities @xmath53 and for the current are very different from the usual quantum mechanical formula .    owing to the denominators in eqs.([eq_heat_capa],[eq_sigmagene ] ) the main contributions to the specific heat and conductivity originate from the modes with the lowest energies @xmath54 .",
    "the above expressions lead to singular power laws which diverge at the transition with characteristic exponents .",
    "the exponents depend on the nature of the low energy modes : their location in momentum space and their dispersion . in the usual case of a uniform superconducting state , namely for @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath55 the low energy modes are concentrated around the center of the brillouin zone and propagate with a quadratic dispersion .",
    "the resulting power - law divergencies of the thermodynamical and transport properties are well - known @xcite . in the vicinity of the tricritical point ,",
    "the situation is much more interesting since three different kinds of spectra @xmath54 , namely ( [ eq_spectreiso ] ) , ( [ eq_spectreaniso ] ) or ( [ eq_spectrum_g_0 ] ) , lead to different power laws .     and anisotropic @xmath30 and @xmath56 models in the regime @xmath57 .",
    "shaded areas represent the low energy modes leading to the various power laws.,width=288 ]",
    "we first consider the isotropic case @xmath42 . at low fields and high temperatures @xmath58",
    ", the positive stiffness @xmath16 leads to the standard spatially uniform superconducting state ( referred as bcs state on fig.[fig_phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "conversely when @xmath59 , the stiffness becomes negative and the fluctuation spectrum @xmath60 may be rewritten as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "below @xmath64 the normal state is instable towards the formation of the fflo state with modulation wave vector @xmath65 .",
    "owing to the isotropy of the model , all directions of @xmath65 are degenerate . above @xmath18 the minima of @xmath66",
    "are attained on a finite dimensional surface : a sphere for @xmath67 or a ring for @xmath68 whose radius is exactly @xmath69 the one dimensional case is special in the sense that the minima consist in two points with coordinates @xmath70 .    at the vicinity of the sphere / ring defined by @xmath71 the approximation@xmath72 may be used to evaluate eqs.([eq_heat_capa],[eq_sigmagene ] ) leading to the following singular behaviors for the specific heat @xmath73 and for the paraconductivity @xmath74 with @xmath75 for @xmath76 respectively .",
    "both @xmath77 and @xmath78 diverge at the fflo critical temperature @xmath18 with the same @xmath13-independent exponent in contrast to the usual uniform superconductivity case .",
    "in particular for the quasi - two and three dimensional cases , the divergencies of the fluctuation contributions near the fflo transition are much stronger than the @xmath79 power law characterizing the usual superconducting transition . in this sense ,",
    "the anomalous behavior of the gaussian fluctuations is a signature of the fflo state in such ideal isotropic systems .",
    "the previous results @xmath80 rely deeply on the perfect isotropy of the model .",
    "nevertheless real superconductors are anisotropic owing to either crystalline effect or @xmath13-wave pairing .",
    "hence the minima of the dispersion occur at a few number @xmath81of isolated points @xmath82 which are located at a finite distance from the origin .",
    "these points belong to high symmetry lines of the crystal .",
    "more specifically in the model @xmath83 the wave vectors @xmath84 are along the diagonals when @xmath85 and along the crystalline axis for @xmath86 , whereas @xmath87 corresponds to the isotropic case .",
    "the relevant low energy fluctuations form small islands around the points @xmath82 , as shown in fig.[fig_crossovers].@xmath30 . in the case of a very weak anisotropy @xmath88",
    ", these pockets may collapse within a finite dimensional surface and one recovers the isotropic model discussed above , see fig.[fig_crossovers].@xmath89 .",
    "here we consider the opposite case of significant anisotropies @xmath90 which is expected in real compounds .",
    "then the favored modes belong to @xmath81disconnected islands .",
    "hence one may focus on each of the @xmath82 obtained by solving @xmath91 and expand the fluctuation spectrum of @xmath92 around @xmath82 as@xmath93 where @xmath94 is the effective mass tensor for the fluctuating modes located around @xmath82 .",
    "owing to the symmetry of the crystal , the eigenvalues @xmath95 of the tensors @xmath96 are the same for the @xmath97 islands .",
    "evaluating @xmath98 and @xmath99 with the spectrum @xmath100 and collecting the contributions from the @xmath101minima yield the specific heat @xmath102 and the diagonal paraconductivity @xmath103 in the plane @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the eigenvalues of @xmath108 whose eigenvectors span the @xmath104 plane . for the conductivity @xmath109 one should replace @xmath110 by @xmath111 .",
    "in sharp contrast to the isotropic model results ( [ heatiso],[condiso ] ) , the temperature dependence of both @xmath112 and @xmath113 becomes sensitive to the dimension with the same exponents as in the homogeneous case @xcite .",
    "thus in the anisotropic model , the exponents themselves no longer provide a valuable hallmark for the fflo state .",
    "naturally when @xmath114 one should recover the isotropic results ( [ heatiso],[condiso ] ) .",
    "the crossover from anisotropic to isotropic models is provided by the @xmath115 dependence of @xmath116 the latter determinant vanishes in the limit @xmath114 , as an example like @xmath117 in the quasi - two dimensional case .",
    "let us check now the validity of the approximations ( [ eq_spectreiso ] ) and ( [ eq_spectreaniso ] ) used so far in deriving the specific heat and paraconductivity .",
    "we aim to identify the region of the phase diagram where the previous results ( [ heatiso],[condiso ] ) and ( [ heataniso],[condaniso ] ) apply .",
    "the modes which participate to the singular parts of the specific heat and conductivity are spread within a shell of width @xmath118 around the circle @xmath71 ( isotropic case ) or in islands of size @xmath118 centered at isolated points ( anisotropic case ) . the width @xmath119 , which is defined by the condition @xmath120 ,  must be smaller than @xmath121 in order to have well defined shell or islands ( like in fig.[fig_crossovers].@xmath30 ) .",
    "hence the common range of validity of eqs.([heatiso],[condiso ] ) and ( [ heataniso],[condaniso ] ) is given by @xmath122 or equivalently @xmath123 this corresponds to the area of the phase diagram which is sufficiently apart from the tricritical point ( large enough @xmath16 ) and close to critical line ( small enough @xmath124 ) , schematically the region ii on fig.[fig_phase_diagram ] .",
    "conversely when @xmath125 the relevant low energy modes merge towards the center of the brillouin zone and the approximations ( [ eq_spectreiso ] ) and ( [ eq_spectreaniso ] ) fail . hence the specific heat and paraconductivity",
    "must be reevaluated in the regime @xmath126",
    ". then the physics is dominated by extremely soft fluctuation modes having a quartic dispersion instead of the more usual quadratic one , yielding very special behaviors in the region iii of fig.[fig_phase_diagram ] .",
    "finally we investigate the crossover regime between region i and iii , see fig.[fig_phase_diagram ] .",
    "when @xmath24 the specific heat is given by @xmath127 in the isotropic case , @xmath128 being the surface of the @xmath13-dimensional unit sphere .",

    ", one has @xmath147where @xmath148 .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the expressions ( [ heatiso],[condiso],[heataniso],[condaniso ] ) applying in region ii yield naturally the power laws ( [ heattri],[condtri ] ) accounting for the region iii when @xmath149 .",
    "first from eqs.([heatiso],[heataniso ] ) , the specific heat is proportional to the product @xmath150 in the isotropic model and to @xmath151 @xmath152 in presence of sensible anisotropy , since the eigenvalues @xmath95 of the effective mass tensor scale as @xmath16 and @xmath153 taking in mind that @xmath154 along the transition line , one obtains the more divergent @xmath155 behavior of the specific heat already predicted as eq.([heattri ] ) in region iii for both isotropic and anisotropic models .",
    "we have used the fact that the fflo and the second order uniform transition lines intersect themselves at the tricritical point . furthermore similar scaling on eqs.([condiso],[condaniso ] ) reveals that the conductivity in region ii is proportional to @xmath156 for the isotropic model and to @xmath157 for anisotropic models . in both situations",
    ", the substitution @xmath154 leads to the same power ( @xmath158 , predicted above as eq.([condtri ] ) , for the paraconductivity . in summary and more generally ,",
    "quartic terms in @xmath54 dominate the quadratic ones when @xmath159 and @xmath160 , see region iii in fig.1 .",
    "up to now the orbital effect was neglected to emphasize the influence of the zeeman pair - breaking effect on the superconducting fluctuations .",
    "this is exact in ultracold fermionic atoms since there is no orbital effect at all for neutral objects .",
    "this is also a good approximation in superconductors with large maki parameter which are the ones where the fflo state is expected .",
    "such a situation is generally encountered for i ) layered superconductors under in plane magnetic field when the weakness of the interplane coupling quenches the orbital motion of the electrons ( or for thin films of 3d superconductors ) , and ii ) magnetic superconductors where the field originates from internal ordered magnetic moments .    beside these favorable situations",
    ", one should evaluate the effect of orbital pair - breaking on the results obtained previously , especially for three dimensional superconductors under external magnetic field . under strong magnetic field ,",
    "the electronic motion is described by the lowest landau level wherein the kinetic energy is totally quenched except along the direction of the field .",
    "this provides a realization of an effective one - dimensional system .    coming from the bcs side with @xmath24 we evaluate how the fluctuation specific heat and paraconductivity scale as one approaches the tricritical point along the critical line @xmath146 , namely in the limit @xmath161 for strong enough fields or sufficiently close to the transition line , the main contribution to the specific heat",
    "is given by the lowest landau level as @xmath162 transforming the three - dimensional fluctuations into one dimensional fluctuations characterized by @xmath163 , @xmath164 being the landau level spacing and @xmath165 yielding the transition line under magnetic field . in a similar manner one may demonstrate that the magnetoconductivity along @xmath166-axis is given by @xmath167",
    ". in sum one encounters a divergency of the specific heat while the magnetoconductivity @xmath109 is not singular in the limit @xmath168 performed along the bcs transition line .    approaching the critical point along the line",

    "more precisely and using our notations , the width @xmath184 of the fflo critical regime is given by @xmath185 when the fluctuations propagate quadratically , namely when @xmath186 ( regions i and ii of fig.[fig_phase_diagram ] ) . here",

    "however even the largest value of the critical region at @xmath133 is still very small , @xmath190 .",
    "therefore the gaussian approximation provides an excellent description of the fluctuation phenomena which may be observed at the superconducting fflo transition . on the other hand",
    "the analysis @xcite may be relevant to the case of fermionic cold atoms where the ratio @xmath191 is not so small .",
    "we have demonstrated that the transition towards the fflo state reveals very unusual and rich fluctuation regimes which may serve as a smoking gun of the fflo state .",
    "atomic fermi gases provide a unique realization of an isotropic system while any real superconductor always presents some degree of anisotropy owing either to crystalline effects and/or @xmath13-wave pairing .",
    "the fluctuation contribution vary non - monotonously near the tricritical point when we go from the uniform to fflo state . in the vicinity of the tricritical point ( region iii )",
    "the very special exponents are expected for specific heat and paraconductivity divergencies owing to the presence of soft modes with unusual quartic dispersion .",
    "the presence of the tricritical point is signaled by very pronounced crossovers regimes which might be observed in experiments , by varying temperature or magnetic field . finally , the fluctuation behavior of the magnetic susceptibility is also very peculiar at the fflo transition and warrants detailed analysis @xcite .",
