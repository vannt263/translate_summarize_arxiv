    "mn - doped _",
    "c_-si , in particular , is of much interest due to its compatibility with si - based semiconductor technology .",
    "however , the solubility of mn in crystalline group - iv semiconductors is extremely low",
    ". therefore , to stabilize mn doping above the solid solubility limit , one must utilize highly non - equilibrium doping techniques such as low temperature molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe )  @xcite or ion - implantation  @xcite .",
    "recent studies on mn - implanted crystalline si ( _ _ c-__si@xmath1:mn@xmath0 ) thin films prepared by the latter technique have achieved mn doping levels of a few atomic percent ( @xmath2@xmath60.05 )  @xcite .",

    "determining whether the ferromagnetism in mn - doped _ c_-ge and _ c_-si is intrinsic or not in origin , is however , very challenging due to thermodynamically favorable fm second phases or possible nano - structures , which are hard to detect by conventional structural characterization tools .",

    "the ferromagnetism in these systems was attributed to a mn - rich ge phase  @xcite and mnsi@xmath8 nano - crystallites  @xcite in the former and latter systems , respectively .",
    "one way to stabilize homogeneous mn doping is to prepare the film in the amorphous form .",
    "a strong attraction of a high quality amorphous matrix is its outstanding flexibility to incorporate high concentration of dopant atoms with large radius , such as gd  @xcite . for up to 19 at.% gd doping ,",
    "the structure of the gd - si solid solution is arranged such that its atomic number density is almost the same as that of pure amorphous si ( _ a_-si ) .",
    "while the amorphous structure may alter the long - range magnetic ordering ( especially for afm materials ) , the localized magnetic moment at each doping site should still be preserved since charge and spin states are primarily determined by the local environment . instead of directly addressing the question of whether the final solid - state is ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic , it is conceptually easier to understand the existence of local magnetic states , which are the building blocks for more complicated magnetic interactions and orderings .",
    "this conceptual simplification was suggested to be of great value in understanding the ferro- and antiferro - magnetism in transition - metal solid solutions  @xcite , and may also apply to the study of transition - metal - doped semiconductor alloys .",

    "is not fully understood , but is clearly related to a carrier - moment exchange interaction and magnetically - induced disorder in zero magnetic field which leads to carrier localization .",

    "this @xmath20 is rather high compared to that found in amorphous mnsi ( @xmath2=0.5 ) , with sg freezing at @xmath21=22 k. such high @xmath20 requires a local mn moment with @xmath9-@xmath9 exchange interactions .",

    "the 4 nearest neighbors ( tetrahedral symmetry ) and the 6 second nearest neighbors ( octahedral symmetry ) of an interstitial site in _ c_-si are very close together and thus both sets of neighbors take part in determining the crystal - field splitting .",
