    "recent discovery of the superconductivity in mgb@xmath0@xcite with relatively high transition temperature ( @xmath3k ) has invoked renewed interests in @xmath4-bonded materials .",
    "electronically , the system is a @xmath5 electron system on layered honeycomb lattice , which immediately reminds us of graphite intercalation compounds ( gic ) such as lic@xmath6@xcite or kc@xmath7@xcite .",
    "while the gic is considered to be a conventional superconductor with @xmath8k , mgb@xmath0 has an unusually high @xmath9 for @xmath4-bonded materials ( with a recent exception of c@xmath10-fet structure@xcite ) .",
    "recently , choi _",
    "et al._@xcite have used an ab - initio pseudopotential density functional theory to solve eliashberg s equation numerically , and have reproduced @xmath11k , isotope - effect exponent @xmath12@xcite , and have obtained a gapful bcs pairing , which is consistent with experimental results such as specific heat@xcite , tunneling and photoemission spectra@xcite , penetration depth@xcite , and the raman spectra@xcite . thus gic and",
    "mgb@xmath0 both seem to be mainly phonon - mediated superconductors .",
    "however , to realize a high @xmath13 , electron repulsion should not stand in the way of the phonon mechanism , so the question may be paraphrased : can the electron repulsion stand away from or possibly even assist the phonon - mediated pairing .    on a more positive side , superconductivity from electron - electron repulsion itself is fascinating in many ways , but there are many open questions . while there is a growing consensus that high-@xmath13 cuprates",
    "may be related to the electron correlation , we are only beginning to understand the link between the underlying band structure and the way in which the electron - mechanism superconductivity appears@xcite .",
    "indeed , the way in which the superconductivity occurs is sensitively affected by the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "recently , two of the present authors proposed@xcite that multi - band systems should open a new possibility of much higher @xmath9 , where a fully gapped bcs gap function can appear when the fermi surface consists of disconnected pieces , while the usual wisdom dictates that the repulsion - originated superconductivity should have , as in the cuprates , a strongly anisotropic gap function with nodes .",
    "they have conceived and demonstrated that , for some two - dimensional lattice models , the pair scattering ( the coulombic matrix elements that scatter pairs of electrons across the fermi surface ) can occur across the pockets , which gives rise to a gap function that changes sign across the pockets with the same sign within each pocket .",
    "so the purpose of the present paper is a combination of the above two motivations .",
    "namely , we study whether the _ inter - band nesting _ can favor superconductivity arising from electron repulsion in a three - dimensional system , by taking the repulsive hubbard model on a stack of honeycomb lattices as a prototype . there",
    ", the honeycomb , a typical non - bravais lattice , provides two pieces of the fermi surface arising from the two bands , while the stacking can provide a natural nesting along that direction .",
    "so , if the pair scattering across the two bands along the nesting vector works favorably , we can expect a pairing from the interband nesting with the bcs gap with opposite signs across the two bands .",
    "so we have studied the systematic dependence of the solution of eliashberg s equation with the multi - band fluctuation exchange approximation on the shape of fermi surface by changing the band filling and the third - direction hopping .",
    "the presence of a strong inter - band nesting is found to indeed give rise to gap functions that change sign across the two bands , but , if we turn to the symmetry within each band , there exist two , nearly degenerate modes that behave respectively like s- and d - waves .",
    "this implies ( a ) the electron repulsion can assist an s - wave like pairing when the phonon - mechanism pairing exists as a dominant mechanism .",
    "we have further found that ( b ) when the electron repulsion is strong enough , the d - wave is realized , which should be , for a group - theoretic reason , a time - reversal broken linear combination of two symmetries with _ point _ nodes in the gap .    according to the band calculation@xcite ,",
    "the fermi surface of mgb@xmath0 consists of two tubular networks having a boron-@xmath14 character along with two cylinders of the boron-@xmath15 characters . as has been stressed by several authors@xcite ,",
    "the nesting between these two @xmath5 bands are quite good .",
    "although @xmath16 bands are considered to be important in that the electron - phonon interaction is much stronger in this band , here we concentrate on the @xmath17 bands in order to focus on the effects of the fermi surface nesting . the gic , on the other hand , has a much smaller inter - layer transfer energy ( @xmath18 ) , so that the fermi surface is a cylinder of carbon @xmath5 character with no dominant nesting vectors .",
    "so in the latter part of the paper we shall cover both mgb@xmath0- and gic - situations in a systematic variation of @xmath18 and band filling .",
    "the systematic study also serves to explore how the inter- and intra - band nesting compete in realizing superconductivity .",
    "now let us start with the case corresponding to mgb@xmath0 .",
    "spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity is here studied with the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) developed by bickers _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the model is a 3d two - band hubbard model with the repulsion @xmath19 on layered honeycomb lattice , @xmath20 where @xmath19 is the hubbard repulsion .",
    "the essential ingredient here is the non - bravais lattice having a and b sublattices , which has two bands within a layer .",
    "here we assume a non - staggered layer stacking as realized in mgb@xmath0 and gic ( fig.[lattice ] ) , which also depicts the inter - layer hopping @xmath18 .",
    "hereafter we take the intra - layer hopping @xmath21 .",
    "the noninteracting band dispersion for 3d honeycomb is @xmath22}.\\ ] ]    in the two - band flex@xcite , green s function @xmath23 , self - energy @xmath24 , spin susceptibility @xmath25 , and the gap function @xmath26 all become @xmath27 matrices , such as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the matsubara frequency for fermions .",
    "the self - energy is given by @xmath31 where the fluctuation - exchange interaction @xmath32 is @xmath33_{\\alpha\\beta}\\!\\!\\!+\\frac{1}{2}u^2\\!\\!\\left[\\frac{\\chi^{{\\rm irr}}(q)}{1+u\\chi^{{\\rm irr}}(q)}\\right]_{\\alpha\\beta}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -u^2\\chi^{\\rm irr}_{\\alpha\\beta}(q)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 here we denote @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the matsubara frequency for bosons , and @xmath37 the number of @xmath38-points on a mesh .",
    "with dyson s equation , @xmath39_{\\alpha\\beta}=\\left[g^{0}(k)^{-1}\\right]_{\\alpha\\beta}+\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}(k),\\label{equend}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the bare green s function @xmath41_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] with @xmath42 the bare energy , we have solved eqns.([equbegin])-([equend ] ) self - consistently .",
    "@xmath9 may be obtained from eliashberg s equation ( for the spin - singlet pairing ) , @xmath43 where @xmath26 is the gap function , and the pairing interaction @xmath44 is given as @xmath45_{\\alpha\\beta}\\!\\!\\!-\\frac{1}{2}u^2\\!\\!\\left[\\frac{\\chi^{{\\rm irr}}(q)}{1+u\\chi^{{\\rm irr}}(q)}\\right]_{\\alpha\\beta}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + u\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath9 is determined as the temperature at which maximum eigenvalue @xmath46 becomes unity .",
    "the susceptibility , @xmath47_{\\alpha\\beta},\\ ] ] may be expressed as diagonalized components , @xmath48^{2}+\\left|\\chi_{{\\rm ab}}\\right|^{2 } } .\\ ] ] throughout this study , we take @xmath49 @xmath38-point meshes , and the matsubara frequencies @xmath50 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 with @xmath53 , which gave converged results .",
    "let us first discuss the spin structure . we have fitted the shape of the fermi surface to that obtained by the band calculation@xcite to have @xmath54 at @xmath55 , where @xmath1 is band filling ( @xmath56 for half filling)@xcite .",
    "the fermi surface , fig.[mgb2-fermi - chi ] , consists of two sets of tubular networks corresponding to the bonding and anti - bonding @xmath5 bands .",
    "the spin - susceptibility @xmath57 displayed in the same figure shows a sharp peak around @xmath58 reflecting a good nesting along the @xmath59 direction ( arrows in fig.[mgb2-fermi - chi ] ) .",
    "figure [ mgb2-phi ] shows the gap function obtained from eliashberg s equation .",
    "the solutions having the largest @xmath46 are gapless @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which are degenerate .",
    "as expected from kuroki - arita@xcite , a _ gapful _",
    "@xmath62 does exist , although its @xmath46 is slightly smaller than that for the d - wave .",
    "we have called the former solutions ` d - wave ' in that the gap function changes sign as @xmath63 azimuthally ( i.e. , within each band ) , while the latter gap ` s - wave ' in that it does not .    as a hallmark that the scattering of the ( intra - band ) pairs across the inter - band nesting is exploited , all these solutions indeed have @xmath64 we can confirm in eliashberg s eq.([eliashberg ] ) that the sign change across the two bands works favorably in increasing @xmath46 if we note @xmath65 ( peaked around @xmath66 ) and a relation for multiband green s function @xmath67 which gives @xmath68 .",
    "the fact that the dominant ` d - wave ' solutions are doubly degenerate can be understood by a group theoretical argument@xcite , in which these solutions belong to @xmath69 representation for the honeycomb system ( while ` s - wave ' to @xmath70 ) . the true gap function below @xmath9 to maximize",
    "the gap should be a linear combination of the two d - waves , @xmath71 which breaks the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this combination has _",
    "point nodes _ on the fermi surface , which is curious but natural as evident from fig.[d+id ] which superposes two sets of nodal planes to show how the nodal planes intersect each other along some lines for the doubly degenerate function and how these lines in turn intersect the closed fermi surface .",
    "the reason why ` s - wave ' is only subdominant may be traced back to the fermi surface , which is rather extended in @xmath38 space in this particular case , so that there is an appreciable contribution from the intra - band pair scattering that the d - wave can exploit .",
    "if we turn to the temperature dependence of @xmath46 in fig.[su - mgb2 ] , we can see that @xmath46 is significantly smaller than unity even for @xmath72 .",
    "this implies that the spin fluctuation alone is not strong enough to realize the d - wave superconductivity in this temperature range for the band filling and @xmath18 taken here .    on the other hand , the @xmath46 for the gapful ` s",
    "- wave ' pairing is seen to have nearly the same magnitude as that of the gapless d - wave , although @xmath46 is again small .",
    "thanks to the absence of nodes on the fermi surface , this one has a gapful pairing , which is eligible for assisting the phonon - mediated pairing if the electron - phonon interaction is considered on top of the electron - electron interaction@xcite .",
    "so we conclude that inter - band spin fluctuations can work cooperatively with intra - band phonons to realize a gapful superconductivity .",
    "let us depart from mgb@xmath0 to move on to the strong coupling regime in search of superconductivity from electron repulsion alone .",
    "in general , pairing instability mediated by spin fluctuations in 3d systems is definitely weaker than that in 2d systems@xcite .",
    "this has been shown in a flex study for the hubbard model by three of the present authors@xcite , who have identified its reason in the @xmath73 space volume fraction of the effectively attractive pair scattering region that is much smaller in 3d than in 2d .",
    "furthermore , 3d systems have a strong tendency toward various magnetic orders , so that to identify the 3d systems that favor superconductivity from electron repulsion becomes a challenging problem .    here",
    "we have optimized the pairing instability in the layered honeycomb lattice by varying the inter - layer hopping @xmath18 and the band filling @xmath1 .",
    "namely , we have searched for sets of parameter values that give large values of @xmath46 _ without _ encountering antiferromagnetic instability at low temperatures .",
    "the resulting best parameter set is found to be @xmath74 ( inset of fig.[u8-n1.15-tz0.7-fermi - chi ] ) , for which the fermi surface and the ( inverse ) spin susceptibility are shown in fig.[u8-n1.15-tz0.7-fermi - chi ] . in fig.[su - u8-n1.15-tz0.7 ] we can see that the estimated @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the pairing symmetry is again @xmath77 .",
    "apart from the above optimization , we have systematically explored how the inter - band nesting affects the pairing in the 3d honeycomb lattice .",
    "since we wish to separate out the effect of the band filling and the hopping in the @xmath59 direction , we have done this along two paths displayed in fig.[diagram ] .",
    "the first path starts from the parameter values corresponding to the @xmath17 bands in mgb@xmath0 , while the second path includes the parameter regime ( @xmath78 ) which corresponds to gic except for the value of @xmath19 .",
    "the result along the first path is shown in fig.[su - u1.5-tz0.65 ] , where the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath79 is plotted for @xmath80 at @xmath55 .",
    "we can see that the pairing instability becomes weaker as @xmath1 is increased , which is natural since the inter - band nesting becomes degraded along this path .",
    "the result along the second path is displayed in fig.[su - u8-n1.2 ] , where @xmath46 is plotted as a function of @xmath18 for @xmath81 at @xmath55 .",
    "here we have adopted a rather large @xmath82 , because we want to have sizeable @xmath46 over a wide range of @xmath18 including the case of bad nesting . there , we have covered both the layered case ( @xmath83 ) and a quasi-1d case ( @xmath84 ) . as indicated in fig.[su - u8-n1.2 ] , antiferromagnetism occurs ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) when the inter - band nesting becomes too strong as @xmath86 both from below and from above . before the transition to antiferromagnetism occurs @xmath46 increases both from below and from above , indicating that inter - band 3d nesting is effective , the layered case @xmath87 is more advantageous than the case of 2d @xmath88 and quasi-1d @xmath89 on the present path .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the possibility of spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity in 3d honeycomb lattice systematically .",
    "we have shown that if we take the parameter set corresponding to the @xmath17 bands in mgb@xmath0 , the spin fluctuation favors the gapful pairing , which suggests that the electron correlation can help the phonon in forming the cooper pairing .",
    "experimentally , the electron repulsion acting constructively may be confirmed if some phase - sensitive method can detect the gap function having opposite signs in two @xmath5-bands .",
    "when strong enough , the electron repulsion alone will give rise to a @xmath90-wave pairing , with a time - reversal broken @xmath77 symmetry associated with degenerate representations in the non - bravais lattice with peculiar point nodes on the fermi surface .",
    "numerical calculations were performed at the computer center and the issp supercomputer center of university of tokyo .",
