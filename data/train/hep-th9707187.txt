    "scattering amplitudes , radiative corrections , @xmath0 functions of renormalization group , etc .",
    ", all require the computation of feynman integrals@xcite , which are the more complex to evaluate the more loops in a given diagram one has . since this approach is still the best technique we have to study quantum field theory ( qft ) perturbatively , solving feynman integrals becomes basic to do any serious study on physical processes of interest involving those quantities .",
    "such computations become harder to do not only with increasing number of loops , but also with increasing number of massive particles in the intermediate states .",
    "this subject becomes even more compeling as we realize that increasingly higher energies are disposable at particle accelerators and tests for the standard electroweak theory are pushed to new limits .",
    "it is then clear that in order to study radiative corrections there will unavoidably lead us to the necessity of dealing with feynman integrals containing massive intermediate vector bosons , and our ability to perform them will play a key role .",
    "the standard way of solving such integrals starts with the introduction of feynman parameters , wick rotation and then finally , integration .",
    "this method is somewhat tedious and sometimes it is not possible to solve exactly the parametric integrals .",
    "for this reason physicists developed several other techniques to calculate feynman integrals@xcite . a technique known as negative dimensional integration method ( ndim ) @xcite",
    "has also been considered to tackle the problem .",
    "our aim in this work is to further check up on ndim as a useful tool for the referred task . for this purpose",
    ", we use ndim to evaluate the box diagram contributing to the ( see fig.1 ) in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "the outline for our paper is as follows : in section 2 we give a brief review of the methodology to be employed , while in section 3 we compute the integral proper writing down the two well - known hypergeometric series representations for it . in section 4",
    "we consider two particular cases of the given integral , namely , integrals with three and two massive propagators respectively .",
    "finally , in the last section , we make a few comments about the six new results we have for this diagram , which will be the subject to be addressed in our shortly forthcoming paper .",
    "also we mention more complicated integrals , like the ones arising in one - loop correction to bhabha scattering in qed , and off - shell two - loop three point graphs@xcite .",
    "ndim was introduced by halliday and ricotta@xcite some years ago . in this section",
    "we present a brief review of this technique . basically what one does is to perform an analytic continuation    @xmath1    so that one gets a polynomial integral in @xmath2 from a rather complicated one in @xmath3 .",
    "we then solve it in @xmath2 and go back @xcite to @xmath3 , through another analytic continuation .",
    "one of the advantages of ndim is that simultaneously we get several hypergeometric series representations for the integral in @xmath3 , i.e. , we obtain expressions for all the possible regions , physical and non - physical alike , of the external momenta .",
    "we start from the relation@xcite between a gaussian integral and its counterpart in negative dimensions    @xmath4    where in the last step we have expanded the exponential function in taylor series . just like in dimensional",
    "regularization@xcite we take this expression as the definition of the negative @xmath5dimensional integral @xcite .",
    "the middle term is an analytic function of @xmath6 so the integral on the right hand side is also an analytic function of @xmath6 @xcite .    from this equation",
    "we get ,    @xmath7    in a similar way , we can solve , e.g. ,    @xmath8^j\\left[(q - k_1)^2-m^2\\right]^k\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left[(q - k_2)^2-m^2\\right]^l\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    whose counterpart in @xmath3 is the integral    @xmath9 ^j\\left [ ( q - k_1)^2-m^2\\right ] ^k } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\frac{1}{\\left[(q - k_2)^2-m^2\\right ] ^l }   \\label{k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this is one of the integrals that contributes to the amplitude in qed and it is the one we want to evaluate in our `` lab test '' for ndim . of course , since the external photons are real particles , they are on - shell , i.e. , we consider here that @xmath10 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "so , to begin with , let our `` gaussian integral '' be @xmath11 -\\gamma \\left [ ( q - k_1)^2-m^2\\right ] -\\right . }",
    "\\nonumber\\label{gauss } \\\\ & & -\\omega \\left .",
    "\\left [ ( q - k_2)^2-m^2\\right ] \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    completing the square , integrating over @xmath12 and expanding the exponential , we get    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the mandelstam variables ( see fig.1 ) and @xmath16 here is the mass of the virtual matter fields . since we use a multinomial expansion the sum index above must satisfy the constraint    @xmath17    on the other hand , expanding the exponential of ( [ gauss ] ) , we have    @xmath18    and comparing the expressions ( [ geral ] ) and ( [ gauss2 ] ) we obtain a general relation for the integral @xmath19 and a system of linear algebraic equations linking the sum indices @xmath20 , with five equations and seven variables , i.e. , we have twenty - one distinct solutions for this system .",
    "so , transfers the problem of calculating feynman integrals to solving systems of linear algebraic equations , which is an easier task to perform , of course .",
    "and for the particular system we are dealing with above , there are six trivial solutions , which are of no interest at all and therefore discarded , while five are of the hypergeometric type , which will give the known results .",
    "the other ten solutions  the new results  will be the subject of our shortly forthcoming paper .",
    "solving the system we find five hypergeometric series which can be divided into two sets according to its variables , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the solution in the first category is    @xmath23    where we define @xmath24 and use the pochhammer symbol @xmath25    substituting @xmath26 , we get the integral ( [ k ] ) with exponents corresponding to the one we want to calculate for box diagrams . then , the first hypergeometric series representation yields ( in four dimensions )    @xmath27    this result is exactly what was already obtained by davydychev@xcite using the mellin - barnes representation for massive propagators@xcite . note that since we are in euclidean space there is an overall factor @xmath28 difference when compared to davydychev s result , obtained in minkowski space ( his result has the extra factor @xmath28 ) .",
    "this expression is symmetric in @xmath14 and @xmath15 and is nonvanishing for @xmath29 .",
    "it will allow us , in section 4 , to read off the particular cases where the integral has three and two propagators respectively , and also the to other regions of external momenta .",
    "this expression is valid in the region of convergence of the series which defines the @xmath30 hypergeometric function@xcite ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in other words , it is valid below the threshold of pair production .",
    "it is also suitable for studying the non - relativistic limit since the mandelstam variable @xmath14 must be less than @xmath34 .",
    "we note that @xmath35 defines the point where the process changes its nature , that is , there exists the possibility of pair creation and this fact manifests itself in the amplitude as a branch point in the feynman integral@xcite .    the hypergeometric function in ( [ j1 ] )",
    "can be expressed in terms of its double integral representation@xcite , and from there one can arrive at the standard result expressed in terms of a rather cumbersome sum of logarithms and dilogarithms@xcite .",
    "the next set of solutions , also obtained by davydychev@xcite , has variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the inverse of the ones in the first solution . in the following we write down these four solutions :    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    and    @xmath41    from these we construct the second hypergeometric series representation for the feynman integral as just the linear combination @xmath42 , i.e. ,    @xmath43    where the set @xmath44 takes the values @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is another hypergeometric function@xcite .    note that @xmath50 is the of @xmath51 ,",
    "see for example erdlyi _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "while @xmath51 is valid in the non - relativistic case and @xmath50 in the relativistic one , they do not cover all the possible regions of external momenta .",
    "an important point here that one must be aware of is that even though singularities might appear in isolated terms of the rhs , for the special case when @xmath26 , the above equation ( [ j2 ] ) can not be singular since the corresponding formula ( [ j1 ] ) is not .    to overcome this difficulty",
    "let us introduce small corrections in the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath52 of the hypergeometric function @xmath53@xcite .",
    "this recourse corresponds to correcting the exponents of propagators@xcite . in our case",
    "we take @xmath54 @xmath55    next we expand all the ( gamma ) factors which contain @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the @xmath49 functions in taylor series around @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in the end",
    "we take the limit of vanishing @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this result is valid , like in the first case , within the region of convergence of the series which defines the @xmath49 function@xcite , @xmath60    following these steps we arrive at davydychev s second expression for the feynman integral@xcite .",
    "note that now the mandelstam s variables @xmath14 and @xmath15 can never be zero . moreover , like the case of @xmath51 , he has shown that the resulting expression for @xmath50 can be converted into the standard result in terms of sum of logarithms and dilogarithms through the use of a double integral representation for @xmath49@xcite .",
    "we see that with ndim we _",
    "immediately _ get two which are related by .",
    "but as we have mentioned before , there are still ten other solutions for the system , so that we expect that these new results will generate solutions for the integral that are also related by .",
    "the theory of generalized @xcite tells us that there are three continuations with no restriction in the parameters , namely : @xmath61    this is the very relation we saw above , connecting the two .",
    "the other two , @xmath62 and @xmath63 must appear in our new results whether in the form of direct or indirect continuation .",
    "so these new results for the feynman integral ( [ k ] ) will cover all the possible physical regions of external momenta .",
    "if we put in our integral any exponent equal to zero we get an integral with three massive propagators .",
    "ndim must be consistent for any value of the exponents , so , taking for example @xmath64 the result ( [ i1 ] ) gives    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the generalized hypergeometric function of one variable@xcite and @xmath67 the same result arises if one puts @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath69 we need simply to replace @xmath70 to get    @xmath71    where @xmath72 finally , if we take @xmath73 we get the same result as above in virtue of the symmetry ( @xmath74 ) in equation ( [ i1 ] ) .    from these equations above we can also calculate integrals with two massive propagators , i.e. , vacuum polarization - like ones",
    ". in ( [ 3p1 ] ) taking for example @xmath68,we get    @xmath75 where @xmath76 in an analogous way , if we take @xmath73 in ( [ 3p2]),we have    @xmath77 where @xmath78    for the particular cases where the exponents are equal to minus one the results above are respectively given by ,    @xmath79    which can be written in terms of elementary functions@xcite . here",
    "we have already taken the limit @xmath80 , since the result is finite in this limit , and    @xmath81    where now , of course , there is a well - known single pole in the limit @xmath80 .",
    "if one is interested in other regions of external momenta one has to take the @xcite of these results .",
    "we do not need to start from the very beginning , eq.([i1 ] ) , to construct them in other regions , because we know from the theory of complex variables that any functional property of one power series is shared by all the others@xcite .",
    "using ndim we have evaluated a massive box diagram integral , namely , a feynman integral bearing four massive propagators .",
    "this integral is the one appearing in the in qed and the two well - known results , expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions , have been easily found .",
    "so , the computation of such an integral , done as a `` lab test '' for ndim , has revealed to us a powerful technique , which transfers the intricacies of performing feynman integrals in positive dimensions to that of solving a system of linear algebraic equations in negative dimensions , a far simpler task to perform than , e.g. , solving parametric integrals .",
    "more than that , surprisingly , the technique not only reproduces the standard results , but gives simultaneously , solutions covering other regions of the external momenta .",
    "we are studying carefully such solutions and these are going to be the subject of our shortly forthcoming paper .",
    "also more complicated box diagram integrals , such as arising from the one - loop correction to the bhabha - scattering in qed and an off - shell two - loop triangle diagram integral have already been checked by us .",
    "agms would like to thank prof .",
    "andrei davydychev for helpful hints and very clear discussions of @xcite .",
