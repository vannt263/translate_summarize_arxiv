    "the purpose of this article is to investigate the possibility of discretizing the liouville equation z_x y = e^z [ liouvilleeq],or its algebraic version u u_x y -u_x u_y = u^3 , u = e^z , [ algliouvilleeq]while preserving all of its lie point symmetries .",
    "this is quite a challenge , since the lie point symmetry group of these equations is infinite dimensional .",
    "we shall call ( [ algliouvilleeq ] ) the _ algebraic liouville equation_.    the article is part of a general program on the study of continuous symmetries of discrete equations @xcite .",
    "this program has several aspects each possibly requiring different approaches .",
    "they are :    1 .   in relativistic and nonrelativistic quantum mechanics or field",
    "theory on a discrete space ",
    "time , a problem is to discretize the continuous theory while preserving continuous symmetries such as rotational , lorentz , galilei or conformal invariance .",
    "one possible way of doing this is the way explored in the present article , namely to not use a preconceived constant lattice .",
    "instead one can construct an invariant set of equations defining both the lattice and system of difference equations .",
    "the lattice thus appears as part of a solution of a set of discrete equations and the symmetry group acts on the solutions of the equation and on the lattice .",
    "2 .   the study of symmetries of genuinely discrete phenomena , such as molecular or atomic chains , where the discrete lattice is given a priori .",
    "the third aspect of this program fits into the general field of geometrical integration @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to improve numerical methods of solving specific ordinary and partial differential equations , by incorporating important qualitative features of these equations into their discretization .",
    "such features may be integrability , linearizability , lagrangian or hamiltonian formulation , or some other features .",
    "we concentrate on the preservation of lie point symmetries . in our case",
    "the idea is to take an ordinary or partial differential equation ( ode or pde ) with a known lie point symmetry algebra @xmath1 realized by vector - fields .",
    "the differential equation is then approximated by a difference system with the same symmetry algebra .",
    "the difference system consists of a set of difference equations , describing both the approximation of the ode ( pde ) and the lattice .",
    "the difference system is constructed out of the invariants of the lie point symmetry group @xmath2 of the original ode ( pde ) .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath1 of @xmath2 is realized by the same vector fields as for the continuous equation , however its action is prolonged to all points of the lattice , rather than to derivatives .",
    "in section 2 we present the lie point symmetry algebra of the continuous algebraic liouville equation and the corresponding vector fields depending on two arbitrary functions of one variable each .",
    "the symmetry algebra is isomorphic to the direct sum of two virasoro algebras ( with no central extension ) .",
    "we also give the two second order invariants of the maximal finite - dimensional subgroup @xmath0 of the corresponding infinite dimensional symmetry group .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a brief exposition of the method of discretizing differential equations while preserving their point symmetries . in section 4",
    "we discretize the liouville equation on a four - point stencil .",
    "the discretization is invariant under the maximal finite dimensional subgroup , not however under the entire infinite -dimensional group .",
    "section 5 is devoted to numerical experiments .",
    "we choose 3 different exact solutions of the continuous liouville equation and then formulate a boundary value problem that leads to these solutions .",
    "the boundary value problem is then solved numerically , using a standard discretization and our invariant one .",
    "the results are compared to the exact solutions . in all three cases",
    "the invariant discretization is shown to perform considerably better than the standard one .",
    "an alternative symmetry preserving discretization of the liouville equation due to rebelo and valiquette [ 23 ] is discussed in section 6 .",
    "they have succeeded in preserving the entire symmetry group but as generalized symmetries rather than point ones ( only translations and dilations remain as point symmetries ) .",
    "finally , in section 7 we discuss a linearizable discretization due to adler and startsev [ 1 ] and show that it has no continuous lie point symmetries at all . the last section 8 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the liouville system ( [ liouvilleeq ] ) is a remarkable equation that has already been thoroughly investigated .",
    "it was shown by liouville himself @xcite that it is linearized into the linear wave equation by the transformation z = [ 2 , _ x y = 0 .[gensol ] putting @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are arbitrary functions , we get a very general class of solutions of ( [ liouvilleeq ] ) ( and ( [ algliouvilleeq ] ) ) , namely z = [ 2 .[gensol2 ]    in view of ( [ gensol ] ) the liouville equation is linearizable and it is not surprising that its symmetry algebra is infinite dimensional , as was already known in 1898 @xcite . the symmetry algebra of the algebraic liouville equation ( [ algliouvilleeq ] ) is given by the vector fields x(f(x = f(x _ x - f_x(x u _ u , y(g(y = g(y _ y - g_y(y u _ u [ genalg],where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are arbitrary smooth functions . the nonzero commutation relations of the vector fields ( [ genalg ] ) are x(f , x ( f ) = x(f _ x- f_x , y(g , y(= y(g _ y - g_y , x(f , y(g= 0 .",

    "limiting ourselves to a neighborhood of the origin , the above vector fields can be expanded in the basis @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which leads to the commutation relations x(x^m , x(x^n & = & ( n - mx(x^m+n-1 , y(y^m , y(y^n = ( n - my(y^m+n-1 , + x(x^m , y(y^n & = & 0 .",

    "we put @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 $ ] so that @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are independent variables in the determining equations . from",
    "we deduce that @xmath163 and from @xmath164 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are arbitrary functions of their arguments . dividing by @xmath160 and applying the operator @xmath165 ( we have @xmath166 for any function @xmath66 ) and we get [ li4d ] - = - , i.e. the quantity @xmath167 .",
    "so [ li4e ] q^(3)_ij = u_ij . introducing this result into and taking into account that @xmath168 $ ] we find from the coefficient of @xmath169 $ ] that @xmath170 .",
    "thus @xmath171 . introducing this last result into",
    "we find two equations for @xmath172 [ li4f ] & & a_00+a_11-a_01-a_10=0 , + [ li4 g ] & & a_ij=-- .",
    "eq . is identically satisfied by the result obtained in and as a consequence the symmetry algebra of the liouville equation presented by rebelo and valiquette is indeed the sum of two virasoro algebras determined by the two functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 : x(f , g= f(x_i ) _",
    "x_i + g(y_j ) _ y_j - + _ u_ij .",
    "[ 6.12 ] the main difference between these generators and those in ( [ proldiscrvectfield ] ) is that in ( 4.1 ) the coefficients of @xmath173 are locally dependent on the space points , while two points are involved in ( [ 6.12 ] ) .",
    "thus , the expression ( [ li4b ] ) has to be understood as a summation over all points of the lattice . on the contrary ( [ proldiscrvectfield ] ) contains only finite sums over the stencil points .",
    "thus the rebelo",
    " valiquette discretization of the liouville equation is invariant under @xmath100 , but these are generalized symmetries rather than point ones .",
    "these are actually very special generalized symmetries : the lie algebra ( [ 6.12 ] ) can be integrated to the finite transformations ( [ li4a ] ) .",
    "these finite transformations were actually the starting point in the rebelo - valiquette approach .",
    "adler and startsev @xcite have presented a discretization of the algebraic liouville equation ( [ algliouvilleeq ] ) on a four - point lattice , namely [ li3 ] u_i+1,j+1(1+)(1+)u_i , j = 1 .",
    "this equation is linearizable by the substitution [ li3a ] u_i , j= -(v_i+1,j - v_i , j)(v_i , j+1-v_i , j)v_i+1,jv_i , j+1 , where @xmath174 satisfies the linear equation [ li3b ] v_i+1,j+1-v_i+1,j - v_i , j+1+v_i , j=0 .",
    "hence the general solution of ( [ li3 ] ) is [ li3c ] u_i , j= -(c_i+1-c_i)(k_j+1-k_j)(c_i+1+k_j)(c_i+k_j+1 ) , where @xmath175 are arbitrary functions of one index each . we restrict ( [ li3 ] ) to the stencil with @xmath176 , i.e. [ 7.5 ] e = u_11(u_10 + 1)(u_01 + 1)u_00 - u_10u_01=0 , and calculate the lie point symmetries of this equation .",
    "the equation is autonomous , the lattice is fixed ( orthogonal and uniform ) .",
    "hence the symmetry algebra is generated by vector fields of the form [ sli3 ] x_e = q_i j(u_ij ) _",
    "u_ij , satisfying [ 7.7 ] x e |_e=0=0 .",
    "we obtain [ sli3a ] & & q_11(u_01 + 1)(u_10 + 1)u_00 + q_10 u_11(u_01 + 1)u_00 + q_01u_11(u_10 + 1 ) u_00 + + & & + q_00 u_11(u_01 +",
    "1)(u_10 + 1 ) = q_10u_01 + q_01 u_10 .",
    "we eliminate @xmath130 from ( [ sli3a ] ) using ( [ 7.5 ] ) , then differentiate with respect to @xmath160 and obtain [ sli3c ] - = - .",
    "the general solution of ( [ sli3c ] ) is [ 7.10 ] q_ij = u_ij where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are functions of @xmath179 and @xmath180 . substituting ( [ 7.10 ] ) into ( [ sli3a ] ) we find @xmath181 .",
    "it follows that the linearizable discrete liouville equation has no continuous point symmetries at all !",
    "two comments are in order .    1 .",
    "the equation ( [ li3 ] ) is linearizable and hence must have generalized symmetries .",
    "ref.@xcite also contains a linearizable differential - difference liouville equation : [ li2 ] u_i+1u_i - u_i+1u_i = u_i+1u_i(u_i+1+u_i ) . where the dot denotes the derivative of @xmath182 with respect to the continuous variable @xmath76 .",
    "it can be shown using the formalism presented in @xcite that ( [ li2 ] ) does have an infinite dimensional lie point symmetry algebra , isomorphic to the virasoro algebra .",
    "the algebra is realized by evolutionary vector fields of the form [ sli2 ] x_e = q_i(x , u_i , u_i ) _",
    "u_i , q_i = f(x ) u_i + f(x ) u_i .",
    "this corresponds to the standard factor fields [ 7.13 ] x = f(x ) _ x - f(x ) u _",
    "we have shown that at least on a four  point lattice it is not possible to discretize the liouville equation ( [ algliouvilleeq ] ) ( nor ( [ liouvilleeq ] ) ) while preserving @xmath100 as the lie point symmetry group .",
    "that is also impossible on a six  point lattice . on the other hand , rebelo and",
    "valiquette @xcite have introduced a special type of generalized symmetries that leave their discretization of the algebraic liouville equation invariant . in the continuous case",
    "these symmetries reduce to point ones . in the discrete case",
    "they are special in that the vector fields can be integrated to group transformations acting on the equation and on the lattice .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the case of the symmetries of the toda hierarchy @xcite where some generalized symmetries _ contract _ to point ones in the continuous limit .    from the point of view of numerical methods",
    "it remains to explore which discretization provides better results .",
    "a discretization preserving the maximal finite subgroup of an infinite dimensional point symmetry group , or one that transforms point symmetries into generalized ones .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the main purpose of this article is to investigate how continuous physical theories can be discretized while preserving their continuous lie point symmetries . for the liouville equation",
    "we have shown that in a complete discretization it is possible to preserve invariance under under the maximal finite subgroup .",
    "the infinite dimensional lie pseudogroup does not survive as a group of point symmetries .",
    "rebelo and valiquette have shown that the entire virasoro pseudogroup does survive in a different discretization @xcite , but as generalized symmetries .    in section 5",
    "we have tested the quality of our invariant discretization as a numerical method .",
    "we have shown that it actually performs very well .",
    "we are of course aware that what we here call `` standard '' methods can be improved in many other ways .",
    "the use of point symmetries in numerical solutions of partial differential equations deserves a further detailed analysis .",
    "another interesting point is that the linearizable discretization of adler and startsev preserves no point symmetries .",
    "it is thus important to decide which features of a continuous theory one wishes to preserve in a discretization . in this case",
    "linearizability is incompatible with the preservation of point symmetries .",
