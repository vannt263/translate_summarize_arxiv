    "chaotic systems and conventional cryptosystems share many common properties , such as the sensitivity to initial conditions and parameters , high complexity and unpredictability , stochastic and random - like behaviors , and so on @xcite .",
    "shanon , in his seminal paper of cryptography , wrote @xcite : `` in a good mixing transformation ... functions are complicated , involving all variables in a sensitive way . a small variation of any one ( variable ) changes ( the outputs )  considerably . '' these requirements , which are also known as the _ diffusion _ and _ confusion _ properties in conventional cryptography theory , are just some of the fundamental characteristics of chaotic dynamical systems widely studied in the last several decades .",
    "it is indeed a celebrated property of chaotic systems that they can produce highly complex signals while having relatively simple system structures .",
    "whereas the conventional cryptography is mainly based on some particular algebraic or number - theoretic operations , chaos - based cryptography depends entirely on some physical laws , this makes chaos cryptography not only easy to formulate and analyze in theory , but also simply to design and operate in applications . because of these advantages , chaos encryption has been an extremely popular topic of investigation , pursued in recent years by researchers from different fields .",
    "the conventional cryptography works on discrete - value systems while chaotic cryptography works on continuous - value systems .",
    "because of this , the early attempts in this field mainly focused on using chaotic systems as pseudo - random number ( pn ) generators in discrete - value implementations matthews . later , different encryption algorithms were developed based on the different properties of chaos : algorithms that build upon discretization and mapping , ergodicity , perturbation and control , targeting , alphabet units portion etc .",
    ", have been proposed for different purposes @xcite .",
    "each algorithm has its special characteristics and can be well utilized under certain restrictions . in 1990 ,",
    "pecora and carroll published the first paper on chaos synchronization and assumed its application in secure communication @xcite . from then on",
    ", chaos synchronization based encryption ( cse ) has been a hot topic both in theory and in applications @xcite .",
    "comparing with other algorithms , the cse algorithm is advanced in many aspects .",
    "firstly , the well developed theory of chaos synchronization provides a solid basis for its feasibility and performance analysis .",
    "secondly , experiments show that chaos synchronization can be robust and easily realizable in applications .",
    "finally , it is easy to synchronize high - dimensional chaotic systems constructed by coupling or cascading low - dimensional systems , which has been used as a standard method for generating highly complex signals in practical operations . as a result , different encryption schemes based on the idea of cse , such as chaos masking , chaos key shifting and chaotic modulation etc .",
    ", have been proposed in recent years .",
    "initially , chaos encryption was implemented on low - dimensional chaotic systems both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "these encryption methods are reasonably fast , simple to implement , and have been assumed secure .",
    "however , various security flaws have been found , flaws that allow the private message to be extracted without a knowledge of the secret keys , or of the underlying dynamics @xcite . in order to overcome",
    "these drawbacks , recent developments have focused on hyperchaos systems which possess many positive lyapunov exponents ( les ) and are more complex in dynamics . in particular , spatiotemporal chaos has been investigated widely for its excellent performance in correlations and spread spectrum multiple access communication @xcite . however , while the early works on chaos encryption were discussed in the community of applied cryptography , recent works are almost exclusively considered inside the nonlinear systems community .",
    "even a casual evaluation of these algorithms shows a lot of potential pitfalls and inherent drawbacks @xcite . for a good practical encryption algorithm ,",
    "security is not the only requirement ; other properties such as encryption speed and error rate should be considered as well .",
    "unfortunately , so far in the field of chaos encryption , most efforts are still directed at improving system security , with the other properties receiving little attention . in general , when the dimension of a chaotic system is increased , its encryption speed will suffer , and for a cse system , the synchronization time will increase too . together",
    "these will effect the system cost and the global performance in different manners .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to analyze different chaos encryption schemes by taking all these crucial aspects into account .    in this paper , we will analyze different chaos synchronization based encryption schemes from the application point of view .",
    "for each scheme , three properties : security , encryption speed , and error propagation length ( epl ) , will be investigated and compared .",
    "we propose an efficient cryptanalysis method , the error function attack ( efa ) method , for the evaluation of chaos encryption systems .",
    "moreover , we define a quantity , which we call the quality factor ( qf ) , that allows us to compare the practical applicabilities of different cryptosystems .",
    "based on the simulation results , we give a rough ranking of various chaos encryption schemes according to their feasibilities for application .",
    "this paper will be arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we propose and analyze the efa method in detail .",
    "we then evaluate the security of different chaos encryption schemes using the efa method in sec .",
    "iii , and define the quality factor .",
    "comparison of the different encryption schemes using the qf is presented in sec .",
    "iv . a brief conclusion is then given in sec . v.",
    "a cryptosystem is usually designed in such a way that its security relies on as few as possible secrets expressed as keys , and it is also believed that a _ public - structure _ encryption system is more reliable than a secret one @xcite .",
    "a fundamental assumption in cryptanalysis enunciated by kerckhoffs in the nineteenth century is that the security of an algorithm must reside entirely on the key ( the kerckhoffs principle ) . according to this assumption ,",
    "for a good encryption algorithm , if eve ( the eavesdropper ) wants to extract the message transmitted between alice ( the transmitter ) and bob ( the receiver ) , the only thing she needs to do is try to find out the secret key used ; she will not need to spend time on extracting the system s structure .",
    "in contrast , most chaos encryption schemes do not observe this principle rigidly and the implementations try to hide everything from the public .",
    "this approach has many negative impacts both on the system safety and its commercial applications .",
    "based on the requirement of public - structure encryption , there are four general types of cryptanalytic attacks , among them the _ known - plaintext attack _ is the most common one . in the real world , it is easy for an cryptanalyst to get some past plaintext messages that have been encrypted .",
    "hence , when we evaluate the securities of chaos encryption schemes , vulnerability to the known - plaintext attack should be considered first @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will propose a known - plaintext and public - structure cryptanalysis method , the error function attack ( efa ) , for the analysis of chaos encryption .",
    "since the only thing eve needs to do is to find out the secret key @xmath0 , the most straightforward approach would be for her to try every possible key , @xmath1 , that alice and bob probably can use ( the keyspace ) .",
    "this is the so called _ brute - force _ _",
    "attack_. by defining the efa function@xmath2eve can scan the whole keyspace to find out the proper key @xmath3 which satisfies @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 represents the amount of data eve will use , @xmath6 represents the length of each block of plaintext ( @xmath7 ) and ciphertext ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 represents the encryption process and @xmath10 denotes the decryption process",
    ".    for public - structure and known - plaintext attack , there are many well developed methods in conventional cryptanalysis , such as the linear attack and the differential attack .",
    "these methods have proved to be ineffective when used on chaos encryption systems @xcite . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "i , the basic difference between conventional cryptography and chaos cryptography is that the conventional encryption is defined on discrete sets and the chaos encryption is defined on continuous sets .",
    "this makes the keyspace behavior of chaotic systems very different from that of conventional systems @xcite .",
    "due to its continuous - value property , in chaos encryption systems keys that are not identical but are very close can still be used to synchronize the two systems very well , thus will form a _",
    "key basin _ around the actual secret key roy , zhoucs , dachselt , fraser .",
    "because of this , eve will not need to try all the keys in the keyspace ; she can , according to the special characters of key basin , find some optimization method to systematically adjust the trial key @xmath1 untill @xmath3 . by this way",
    ", the cryptanalysis time can be greatly reduced .",
    "in addition to this , efa also attacks the weakest part in chaos encryption systems  the nonchaotic receiver .",
    "since the dynamics of the receiver is definitely not sensitive to the initial conditions and may not be sensitive to the parameter mismatch as well , it is much easier to attack the receiver than to attack the transmitter whose sensitivity depends on both parameters and initial conditions .",
    "thus , as a public - structure and known - plaintext attack , efa not only fully exploits the information of the known structure and known plaintext , but also enjoys the advantage of considerable keyspace reduction by attacking the nonchaotic receiver .",
    "for any encryption scheme , the most important evaluation is about its security . in sec .",
    "ii , we had mentioned that efa has many advantages for cryptanalysis of chaos based encryption . in this section",
    ", we will employ this method to evaluate the security of some popular encryption schemes .",
    "specifically , the active - passive decomposition model , the piecewise linear function model , the time delay model , the noise driving sequential synchronization model , and the one - way coupled map lattices model .",
    "all these models apply chaos synchronization and make use of high dimensional hyperchaos , i.e. they are assumed to have better security than low dimensional chaos . according to the requirement of the kerckhoffs principle",
    ", we consider only systems with the public - structure , i.e. , the entire dynamics is opened to the public except a single parameter which serves as the secret key .",
    "meanwhile , we assume that the eavesdropper could obtain some past plaintext - ciphertext pairs , namely , we consider the public - structure and known - plaintext attack .",
    "efa will be used for analyzing all these cryptosystems .      proposed in 1995 by kocarev _",
    "et al _ and later generalized widely , the active - passive decomposition ( apd )  model has been one of the most popular chaos encryption schemes studied during the past years kocarev-2 .",
    "this model has two important characteristics : ( a ) the message is not added directly to the chaotic carrier but drives the dynamical system constituting the transmitter ; ( b ) the dimension of encryption system can be arbitrarily high by cascading identical or different individual systems , and thus the apd  model had been assumed with high security in early time . for the consideration of the public - structure and known - plaintext attack , each parameter in the equations can be regarded as a secret key in the apd model . here",
    "we use cascaded rssler systems investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite as our model :    transmitter:@xmath11with @xmath12and @xmath13with @xmath14here @xmath15 stands for the message to be transmitted privately and @xmath16 represents the output ciphertext .",
    "all the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , can be used as secret keys and are chosen carefully to keep the last oscillator staying within chaos . in order to simplify the related analysis , we set @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) for each scheme investigated in this paper without losing generality . in fact",
    ", the apd model performs a multiple encryption process : the plaintext is first encrypted to @xmath20 by the first rssler oscillator , then @xmath20 is regarded as the new input plaintext and encrypted to @xmath21 by the second rssler oscillator , and the same process repeated down to the last rssler oscillator which generates @xmath22 as the last output ciphertext . on the receiver side ,",
    "the whole system is identical to the transmitter except the encryption process be reversed ,    receiver :    @xmath23    with @xmath24and @xmath25with @xmath26by setting @xmath27 , the receiver can be synchronized with the transmitter and the message can be recovered step by step using eq .",
    "( 9 ) , and the original message will be recovered at the last oscillator by using @xmath28 .",
    "now we use efa  to analyze the key behavior of this encryption model .",
    "setting @xmath29 , @xmath30 , the transmitter is spatiotemporally chaotic with @xmath31 positive les . in our simulations",
    "we choose the most effective ( for the apd  model , systems are cascaded unidirectionally .",
    "the more last the parameter is , the more sensitive the decryption process will be , this is also verified by our numerical simulations . )",
    "parameter @xmath32 the parameter of the last rssler oscillator , as the secret key for encryptions and define the keyspace by keys that keep the last rssler oscillator in the chaotic regime . for eve , she has all the knowledge about the transmitter and the receiver except @xmath32 , and she also knows the range of  the keyspace .",
    "consequently , she can run the receiver , eqs .",
    "( 6)-(9 ) , by choosing the trial key @xmath33 randomly within the keyspace , and calculate the corresponding error function results by using eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we plot the key basin for the @xmath34 apd  model by using efa@xmath35it is found that the whole keyspace @xmath36 $ ] forms a single key basin , two straight lines with reversed slopes dominate the behavior of @xmath37 .",
    "the secret key @xmath38 is located at the minimum point @xmath39 . with this structure",
    ", eve can find the correct key easily through some adaptive adjustments .",
    "for example , eve can first try arbitrarily two trial keys in the keyspace , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and by comparing the respective values of @xmath42 , she will know which direction she should be adjusting her next attempt . in our simulations , only @xmath43 to @xmath44 tests are needed to find the properly location of @xmath45 . furthermore , by using the slopes , we can evaluate @xmath45 proximately only by two trial keys .",
    "we refer to this kind of key basin as the _ triangle basin _ and the method for key searching mentioned above as the _ adaptive adjustment method _ ( aam ) .",
    "it is obvious that this model has no security against efa .    in order to investigate the relationship between the dimension and the security in this type of scheme",
    ", we also plot the key basins for @xmath46 in fig .",
    "1(b ) . as the dimension of the system increases , the key basin changes only in shape , but the structure of triangle basin still persists .",
    "this kind of basin structure can also be found in other apd  based models , and in fig .",
    "2 we plot the related key basins for the model used in ref .",
    "all parameters and dynamics of the systems are those of the original paper and the parameter in the equation of the first variable is chosen as the key .",
    "we find that no matter how high the system dimension is ( the dimension changes from @xmath47 to @xmath48 in our simulations ) , the triangle basin remains .",
    "( we should mention that as the system dimension is increased , we also see a longer transient time before the triangle basin becomes manifest . )",
    "therefore , increasing the system size ( i.e. , the dimension of hyperchaos )  does not lead to an increase in security for this encryption scheme .",
    "this result is rather surprising , and this behavior should be seriously considered whenever one hopes to reach high security by increasing the dimension of chaotic system , or say , by applying spatiotemporal chaos .      for a long time , the piecewise linear function model has been another popular nonlinear model investigated extensively piecewise-1,piecewise-2,piecewise-3 .",
    "there exists a well - developed theory of piecewise linear maps which generate uniformly distributed signals , and it is known that piecewise linear maps share nice properties of invariant measures , ergodicity and statistical independence @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors proposed an efficient encryption scheme based on coupled piecewise linear maps , and they declared that such cryptosystems not only enjoy high security , but also have an `` immense parameter space ''  for key choosing even in lower dimensional encryption systems . here",
    "we choose the five - dimensional system used there as our model and analyze its security by using efa .",

    "( 25 ) and eqs . (",
    "26 ) also serve to greatly improve the system security .",
    "this is therefore a system that potentially has both high security and fast encryption speed .    with the requirement of public - structure and known - plaintext",
    ", we study system s key basin by using the efa@xmath141with @xmath142 representing the corresponding output in the receiver for the trial key @xmath143 . in fig .",
    "6 we plot the simulation results for @xmath144 with the secret key chosen as @xmath145 .",
    "the key basin is observed to be within the range @xmath146 $ ] .",
    "since the whole keyspace for this kind of system is at least within range @xmath147 $ ] , it needs at least @xmath148 tests to determine the correct secret key using efa .",
    "we have also investigated through simulations the key basins for other output sequences @xmath149 , and found that the widths of the key basins typically range from @xmath150 to @xmath151 , depending on where the output lattice is located .",
    "this suggests that any one output sequence is a good candidate for encryption . in comparison with other four models mentioned above",
    ", this model appears to possess much higher system security .",
    "in conventional cryptography , three criteria are commonly considered when designing an effective and applicable cryptosystem : security , the encryption speed , and the error rate @xcite . for chaos based encryption ,",
    "relatively little attention has been paid to the latter two criteria kocarev - ieee , dachselt , fraser , which are intimately linked to the attempts to achieve greater security .",
    "first of all , security of a cryptosystem depends mainly on its dimension : the higher the dimension , the more complex the signal it can generate .",
    "however , high dimensional systems usually incur greater encryption time cost in both software and hardware implementations .",
    "obviously there will have to be a trade - off between these two in considering the realistic application of a system .",
    "furthermore , higher system security usually implies higher system sensitivity , and this brings about another problem for chaos encryption , name the system stability .",
    "both the encryption systems and the communication channels can be disturbed unavoidably for various reasons like intentional attacks or unintentional perturbations ) .",
    "the system sensitivity of a high security system will amplify these disturbances rapidly .",
    "this is particularly problematic for chaos synchronization based cryptosystems which have to spend a certain time to eliminate these disturbances before any correct communication can be accomplished .",
    "all these highlight the relevance of considerations beyond just system security in evaluating the overall performance and applicability of any given encryption scheme . in this section",
    ", we will analyze the encryption models used in sec .",
    "iii by studying their performance in all the three aspects mentioned above , and compare their advantages and drawbacks from the point of application .    before going further",
    ", we need to give the security a quantitative description .",
    "based on the analysis of efa , there always exists a key basin around the actual secret key . without the knowledge of this basin",
    ", one may not be able to extract the secret key by brute - force or other means of searching .",
    "we define the key basin width , denoted by @xmath152 , by the distance between two trial keys located on the two sides of the key basin , which exceeds the average efa result of the entire keyspace ( see the marked regions in fig .",
    "3(b ) , fig.4 , and fig . 6 ) . here",
    ", we call the number of intervals ( which are potential key basins ) with this width in the whole keyspace as the key number .",
    "( for different choices of the secret key , there can be small differences in the basin widths . ) the security of the system is broken as soon as the actual key basin is exposed , since",
    "the searching cost of extracting the secret key then once is negligible .",
    "this motivates us to define the security of a cryptosystem as the entropy of the key number fraser@xmath153with @xmath154 denoting the length of the entire keyspace and @xmath155 being the key number .",
    "we define the amount ( megabit ) of data that can be encrypted in each second as the _ encryption speed _ , denote it by @xmath156 .",
    "the number @xmath157 of bits that are affected when one bit is in error in the ciphertext is defined as the _ error propagation length _ ( epl ) .",
    "our simulation study is based on software implementation , and treat each variable as a @xmath44-byte ( i.e. @xmath158-bit , double precision , real ) data . in computing the epl , random perturbation is added within the range of the output signals , and the average over @xmath159 runs is taken .    as we had emphasized above , there exist some trade - off relations between security , encryption speed and epl , so from the point of application , we need to strike a balance between these aspects so as to obtain a better overall performance . in this paper , we represent this balance by the _  quality factor _ , which we define as@xmath160although this definition may not reflect the precise relationship in real applications , the quality factor does parameterize the interplay of the factors affecting the overall performance of a cryptosystem in a concrete and reasonable way . but it can fairly well reflect some basic properties for evaluating system s overall performance .",
    "we find the following results for the different encryption models discussed in sec .",
    "iii :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        the above results are obtained on sgi octane workstation ( two 195mhz ip30 cpu 256 m ram , fortran90 compiler ) .",
    "we have also carried out computations on other workstations and compilers and obtained qualitatively similar results .",
    "for the simulations , we choose the parameters as for fig .",
    "1(a )  for the apd model , fig .",
    "3(a ) for the cplf model , fig . 4 for the dde model , figs . 5(a)and ( b ) for the ndss model , and fig . 6 for the ocml model , respectively , so as to maximize the overall performance for each scheme .    based on the above table",
    ", we wish to make the following observations .    1 .   from the security point of view , the ocml and cplf  models perform much better than the other models .",
    "this is mainly due to the modulo operations employed in these two schemes .",
    "the modulo operation disposes the most significant digits in the signals and keep only those less significant digits , making the systems more sensitive to the key values . as verification",
    ", we have also tried applying modulo operations on the output signals of the ndss model ( the same parameters as in figs .",
    "5(a ) and ( b ) ) , and the related efa results are plotted in fig .",
    "7(a )  and ( b )  for the navier - stokes system and the lorenz system , respectively .",
    "the improvement in the system security is obvious .",
    "2 .   the ocml  model possesses excellent encryption speed due to its simple functions and multiple outputs . in our simulation",
    ", we find that although the modulo operation can improve appreciably the system security greatly , it is also a time - consuming function .",
    "this is largely responsible for the low encryption speed of the cplf  model .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath140 simultaneous outputs and the simplicity of the mapping functions more than compensate for the extra processing time linked to the modulo operations .",
    "3 .   finally",
    ", from the results on the epl , it is clear that lower dimensional , mapping systems perform better than high - dimensional , differential systems .",
    "moreover , systems with multiple outputs but with only one as the driving signal has a clear advantage in epl performance .",
    "while the errors in the transmitted bits of the driving signal are responsible for the epl , the remaining nondriving ciphertext bits do not give rise to such a problem , i.e. , one bit error of the transmitted ciphertext causes only one bit error in the received plaintext .",
    "together with the two dimensional structure design and strong couplings , these features give the ocml  model an outstanding performance as far as efl is concerned .",
    "in this paper , we proposed an efficient cryptanalysis tool , the efa method , to study the security of some well - known chaos encryption schemes .",
    "our systematic comparison suggests that even models ( such as the apd and ndss models ) with high dimensionalities ( and hence the supposed higher security ) fail to maintain their security under the efa .",
    "we are also of the opinion that in addition to security consideration , there are other important aspects of cryptosystems which affect their overall performance .",
    "more specifically , we consider , additionally , the encryption speed and the error propagation length , and suggest in this paper a quantity ( the quality factor ) as a possible measure of the overall performance , or applicability , of chaos - based cryptosystems . through comparisons , we find that the modified ocml model has the best overall performance among the models considered , and some the reasons responsible for this performance are briefly discussed .",
