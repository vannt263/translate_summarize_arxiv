    "for comparison , the experimental @xcite data are also shown in the figure .",
    "clearly , our calculated p - v equation of state is well consistent with the experimental measurement for the two phases of puo@xmath0 .",
    "specially , at the calculated transition pressure ( 24.3 gpa ) , our result in fig . [ pressure ]",
    "gives that the volume collapse upon phase transition is 6.8% .",
    "this value is evidently underestimated compared with the experimental data of 12% @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between experiment and our calculation needs more experimental and theoretical works to examine .",
    "after phase transition , we also find an isostructural transition occurring between 75 and 133 gpa for the _ pnma _ phase .",
    "this isostructural transition of actinide dioxides was first found in dft calculations of uo@xmath0 by geng _",
    "et al _ @xcite and then observed in study of tho@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the pressure dependence of the three lattice parameters ( with respect to their values at calculated transition pressure 24.3 gpa ) for the _ pnma _ phase of puo@xmath0 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] .",
    "similar to the studies of uo@xmath0 and tho@xmath0 @xcite , in pressure region before 75 gpa , the responses of the three relative lattice parameters to the compression are anisotropic in the sense that the compression of the middle axis @xmath61 is most rapid compared to those of the long axis @xmath62 and small axis @xmath63 , which vary upon compression almost in the same tendency .",
    "when the pressure becomes higher to be between 75 and 133 gpa , remarkably , it reveals in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] that all the three relative lattice parameters undergo dramatic variations by the fact that the small axis @xmath63 has a strong rebound and the middle @xmath61 is collapsed .",
    "when the pressure is beyond 133 gpa , then the variations of the three relative lattice parameters become smooth and approach isotropic compression .",
    "this signifies a typical isostructural transition for the _ pnma _ phase of puo@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we also present in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] the evolution of the insulating band gap with pressure for _ pnma _ phase of puo@xmath0 .",
    "apparently , the band gap behaves smooth in pressure region of 25 - 92 gpa , then turns to decrease suddenly from about 1.75 ev to zero under compression from 92 to 133 gpa .",
    "this clearly indicates that the _ pnma _ phase will occur a metallic transition after external pressure exceeds 133 gpa . as fig .",
    "[ metallicdos](b ) shows , with increasing pressure in the crossover range between 92 and 133 gpa , the 5@xmath59 electrons in the cotunnite phase of puo@xmath0 are more delocalized and the 5@xmath59 bands are largely broadened . as a result ,",
    "the mott - type band gap is narrowed and even blurred , which is characterized by finite occupancies of o 2@xmath58 and pu 5@xmath59 orbitals at the fermi level , by the increasing kinetic energy of 5@xmath59 electrons . in order to see the pressure behavior of electronic structure with different values of hubbard parameter _",
    "u _ for cotunnite puo@xmath0 , we have plotted in fig . 15 the total dos and pdos for the cotunnite puo@xmath0 afm phase calculated at 92 , 133 , and 248 gpa within lda+__u _ _ formalism with _ _",
    "u__=0 , 4 , and 6 ev .",
    "it clearly shows that ( i ) the pure lda always produces incorrect electronic structure in the full pressure region we considered , and ( ii ) it is not imperative to adjust @xmath3 as varying pressure by the fact revealed in figs .",
    "15(b ) and 15(c ) that the electronic properties and insulator - metal transition behavior at high pressures show the similar character for the two choices of hubbard parameter @xmath3=@xmath64 ev and @xmath3=@xmath65 ev .",
    "based on this observation , in the above high - pressure calculations we have fixed the value of @xmath3 to be @xmath64 ev . it should be stressed that the metallic transition is not unique for puo@xmath0 .",
    "similar phenomenon has also been observed in other actinide dioxides @xcite .",
    "besides , the variation of the local magnetic moment of plutonium atoms is almost same for _ fm@xmath7 m _ and _ pnma _ phases , implying that the magnetic property is insensitive to the structure transition in puo@xmath0 .",
    "actually , the calculated amplitude of local spin moment varies from @xmath664.1 to @xmath663.8 @xmath67 ( per pu atom ) for both fluorite and cotunnite phases in pressure range from 0 to 255 gpa .",
    "no paramagnetic transition for this material has been observed in present study .",
    "in conclusion , the ground state properties as well as the high pressure behavior of puo@xmath0 were studied by means of the first - principles dft+__u _ _ method . by choosing the hubbard _ u _ parameter around 4 ev within the lda+__u _ _ approach , the electronic structure , lattice parameters , and bulk modulus were calculated for both the ambient _",
    "fm@xmath7 m _ and the high - pressure _ pnma _ phases of puo@xmath0 and were shown to accord well with experiments . results for uo@xmath0 were also presented for comparison .",
    "based on these results , the pu@xmath9o and u@xmath9o bonds were interpreted as displaying a mixed ionic / covalent character by electronic structure analysis . after comparing with our previous calculations of npo@xmath0 and tho@xmath0 , we demonstrated that the pu@xmath9o , u@xmath9o , and np@xmath9o bonds have stronger covalency than the th@xmath9o bond .",
    "the ionicity of th@xmath9o bond was found to be the largest among these four kinds of actinide dioxides .",
    "in addition , the stability of the two phases at zero pressure was predicted through calculating elastic constants and phonon dispersion .",
    "the hardness , debye temperature , ideal tensile strength , and thermodynamic properties were calculated and analyzed to support the practical application of puo@xmath0 .",
    "we showed that the hardness of _",
    "m _ phase is @xmath6827 gpa and the debye temperatures of _",
    "fm@xmath7 m _ and _ pnma _ phases are 354.5 and 350.0 k , respectively . for _",
    "puo@xmath0 , the ideal tensile strengths are calculated within fpctt to be 81.2 , 28.3 , and 16.8 gpa in tensile deformations along the [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 111 ] directions , respectively .",
    "the volume thermal expansion and specific heat at constant volume curves are well consistent with available experiments . however , the discrepancy between measured and our calculated specific heat at constant pressure in high temperature domain is evident .",
    "this needs further theoretical work by including the anharmonic ionic contribution to decrease this kind of discrepancy .    in studying the pressure behavior of puo@xmath0",
    ", we showed that the _",
    "_ fm@xmath7m__@xmath69_pnma _ transition occurs at 24.3 gpa .",
    "although this value is large smaller than the experimental report , we believe that our calculated result is reasonable .",
    "one reason is that the lattice parameters of _ pnma _ puo@xmath0 afm phase calculated at around 39 and 49 gpa are precisely consistent with experiment .",
    "another is the fact that the experiment needs improvement as having been indicated in study of uo@xmath0 and tho@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we extended the pressure up to 280 gpa for the two structures of puo@xmath0 . a metallic transition at around 133 gpa and an isostructural transition in pressure range of 75 - 133 gpa were predicted for the _ pnma _ phase . also , the calculated amplitude of local spin moment only varies from @xmath664.1 to @xmath663.8 @xmath67 ( per pu atom ) for both fluorite and cotunnite phases in pressure range from 0 to 255 gpa .",
