    "increasing usage and diverse applications of the wireless communication networks have led to a high demand of vacant spectrum . most of the wireless communication is carried out on the licensed band .",
    "many studies on spectrum utility like that in [ 1 ] have revealed that these licensed spectrum are being significantly underutilized .",
    "joseph mitola in 1999 [ 2 ] devised a unique method to use the unused spectrum by introducing the concept of cognitive radio .",
    "cognitive radio controls its transmitter and receiver parameters intelligently so as to use the vacant licensed spectrum without affecting the working of the primary licensed users ( pu ) of these licensed bands .",
    "firstly the cognitive radio users ( cr users ) sense for vacant spectrum in their surroundings and then carry on communications among other cr users .",
    "the cr users are permitted to use these spectrum provided they do not cause any harmful interference to the pu and allow fair share of the available spectrum among themselves .",
    "television broadcast frequencies below 700 mhz have been proposed for the cr operations [ 3 ] .",
    "+ spectrum sensing and channel assignment are the keys behind the successful operation of cognitive radio networks ( crns ) formed by these cr nodes .",
    "spectrum sensing is employed at the physical layer and is responsible for detecting any pu activity and locating white spaces ( vacant bands ) in the spectrum .",
    "channel allocation and management is mainly carried out by the mac protocol at the link layer .",
    "most of the mac protocols proposed in the literature utilize a common control channel ( ccc ) to exchange control information among the cr nodes and assign the vacant channels to various nodes according to channel negotiations in the network .",
    "generally , a control channel is one of the unlicensed band assigned solely for exchanging control information .",
    "the protocols proposed in [ 4][5 ] have employed ccc for exchanging control information and negotiating the vacant bands for their data transmissions .",
    "cognitive radio ( cr ) is a key enabling technology for the dynamic spectrum access ( dsa ) .",
    "the radio senses its surrounding environment for the vacant spectrum which is not being utilised and makes use of it to transmit information to other cognitive radio nodes .",
    "hence it controls its transmitter or receiver parameters to intelligently adapt to its surroundings without affecting the working of the primary licensed users .",
    "the vacant spectrum are also referred to as spectrum holes or white spaces .",
    "the cognition power of the radio i.e. the power of the radio to adapt itself with its surrounding makes it special .",
    "this capability of the cogntive radio to use and share the spectrum in an opportunistic way is called bandwidth harvesting",
    ". + there are many hardware and software developments being carried out to facilitate the growth of cognitive radio .",
    "the concept of software defined radio ( sdr ) given by joseph mitola has now became an exciting new field of study . by the sdr ,",
    "the radio could be programmed and used as desired .",
    "the built - in software component in the sdr imparts cognitive ability to the radio and makes it smart .",
    "the transmitter and receiver frequencies can suitably be varied using this software radio .",
    "this enables us to properly use the white spaces , which results in increasing spectrum utility .",
    "there are many applications that could be introduced using this concept without any problem of spectrum availability .",
    "some of the main components of the cognitive radio are as follows :    * * primary users * : also called as licensed users .",
    "these users have a license to operate in a certain spectrum band . * * primary network * : this is the network on which the primary users operate .",
    "this is an existing network infrastructure and has all rights over a particular spectrum band . *",
    "* secondary users * : also called unlicensed users or cognitive users .",
    "they do not hold a licence for operating in the particular band .",
    "they can only use the spectrum when it is free or not used by the primary users . * * secondary network * : also called cognitive radio network . the network formed by the secondary nodes with no license to operate in the desired spectrum band .",
    "the cognitive radio network ( crn ) is formed by a group of nodes with cognitive radio capabilities and which operate on opportunistically available licensed spectrum .",
    "the crn should work in such a way that they do not cause any harmful interference to the primary users .",
    "hence it is very much required in the crns that the nodes regulate their transmission power , the spectrum band on which they transmit / receive and the time as to when to transmit .",
    "the cognitive users have to sense the spectrum to locate the spectrum holes or white spaces and then they negotiate with the other cr users for accessing the channel .",
    "after every certain amount of time they have to sense the channel for any primary user activity so that they do not hamper the communication of the primary users .",
    "television broadcast frequencies below 700mhz have been proposed for cr operations[6 ] .",
    "in addition to this the spectrum reserved for public service operations can also be used with frequent quiet periods for cr operations .",
    "the cognitive radio networks could be classified into two main categories namely :    * * centralised cognitive radio networks * : in this type of network there is one main base station and multiple cr users which coordinate with the base station .",
    "the base station determines the spectrum band which are empty and allocate the bands to the different cr users according to their requirements .",
    "the cr users send their sensing parameters to the base station to determine which all spectrum bands to be used .",
    "the base station may also be connected to a central spectrum server which could provide the information regarding the availability of the spectrum bands . *",
    "* distributed cognitive radio networks * : in this type of network there is no central controlling unit , while all the cr users are independent .",
    "a good coordination i.e. mac protocol is required to coordinate among them .",
    "each cr user has a sensing module which senses the channel for white spaces and negotiates the band with the other users in the network . these are also called cognitive radio adhoc network .",
    "some aspects of cognitive radio networks are as follows :    * * spectrum sensing * : spectrum sensing implies detecting the unused spectrum and utilising the spectrum without causing harmful interference to primary users . * * spectrum management * : this means to manage the available spectrum resources and using the best spectrum to meet the communication requirements . * * spectrum mobility * : this applies to maintaining unhindered communication even while transiting from one spectrum band to a better spectrum band . * * spectrum sharing * : sharing the available spectrum fairly among other cr users .    with the advancement in the cognitive radio networks the ieee 802.22 standards for the wireless regional area networks has been formulated .",
    "this is for the infrastructure based cognitive radio networks with the central base station managing the spectrum and allocating resources to other users .",
    "there are many emerging cognitive radio network applications given in [ 4 ] .",
    "following illustrate some of these applications .    *",
    "* public safety system * : wireless communications are extensively used for emergency services like police and medical services to respond to emergency situations .",
    "these safety workers are equipped with various modules like mobiles , video telephony etc . to improve their efficiency and to be always be in touch with their co - workers and central authorities .",
    "the crns are extensively proposed for these kinds of services as they promise high spectrum coverage in such situations where large bandwidth might be required . * * smart grid networks * : a smart grid is a network which attempts to intelligently guess the behaviour of all electric power users and smartly respond to their actions in order to efficiently deliver reliable , economic , and sustainable electricity service .",
    "this increases the reliability and efficiency of electricity transmission and reduces cost for consumers and producers .",
    "these grids make use of wifi , zigbee , tv white spaces ( tvws ) , cellular networks in rural areas as the primary spectrum for their cognitive nodes for easy communication . * * wireless medical network * : there is a large variety of applications and services that are used in the hospitals like online monitoring of patients health , online medical records of patients .",
    "these crns could prove very useful at these places where the unlicensed spectrums are used and spectrum demands are high . * * cognitive radio sensor networks * : sensor networks practically generate bursty data .",
    "the transmission of such bursty data at any given time requires a high bandwidth for a small period of time .",
    "else small bandwidth or less number of channels may cause high collisions and make the system inefficient[5 ] .",
    "realising crsns involve few challenges such as design of power - efficient and low - cost cognitive radio sensor nodes , and opportunistic multi - hop routing over licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands .",
    "these could be used for real - time applications , multimedia applications or indoor sending applications . *",
    "* other areas * : cognitive radio networks would prove efficient in areas where the main spectrum used is the ism unlicensed bands .",
    "as there is large number of applications coming up in this part of the band , hence there is a scarcity of unlicensed spectrum to communicate .",
    "crns are highly capable in covering these shortcomings in various such applications .",
    "the success of cognitive radio networks highly depends on how the spectrum is being accessed .",
    "there has been great interest in mac protocols in recent times .",
    "the medium access control ( mac ) forms an essential component behind the successful and efficient working of the crns .",
    "the mac provides the rules for assessing the channel and how to share the available channels among other cr users .",
    "+ mostly the mac for crns are based on using a dedicated control channel [ 10][11 ] for suitable exchange of control informations .",
    "this kind of mechanism have limitations like channel saturation and availability of such channel .",
    "there are other methods proposed as well in the literature like hopping based control channels [ 13 ] and csma based mac protocols but they too have their drawbacks like unnecessary delays . + hence while the mac protocol as a high contribution inefficient working of crns , the current protocols proposed have many limitations",
    ". motivated by this problem , we have tried to develop a new mac protocol which could achieve optimal performance .      in this article",
    "we propose a novel tdma based mac protocol for cognitive radio adhoc networks .",
    "we have introduced a scheme to guarantee qos , wherein the real - time traffic is given high priority as compared to non - real time traffic .",
    "we have also proposed a technique to restrict the operation of malicious user trying to hog up the bandwidth .",
    "the protocol aims to achieve the following .    * designing an effective method to exchange control information among cr nodes without the use of a dedicated control channel . *",
    "maintain a level of qos among the cr users and giving priority to safety critical data and real - time traffic .",
    "* maintaining fairness among all the cr users and giving equal chance to all the nodes to access the available channel . *",
    "the protocol aims at increasing the utility of the spectrum by fully utilising the available spectrum . * making the system robust against any operation of malicious user .",
    "* the protocol should guide the system efficiently and coordinate all the users effectively without the help of any master node . *",
    "the cr nodes could be battery operated so the protocol should be energy - efficient .",
    "we have analysed our protocol by simulating in ns-2 .",
    "we have shown the effect on performance of the protocol under varying conditions .",
    "we have also give a theoretical derivation of the maximum throughput of the system and energy efficiency achieved by the protocol .",
    "the rest of the article is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 of this article gives a brief description of the existing mac protocols for the cognitive radio networks .",
    "section 3 describes the detailed outline of the proposed mac protocol .",
    "section 4 gives a detailed analysis of the protocol with the analytical and simulation results .",
    "section 5 concludes the article with the list of future works for research on cr medium access control protocols .",
    "the mac protocol directs the cr users that which user would access the spectrum and when to access the channel . in this section",
    "we would discuss the existing mac protocols for the cognitive radio networks .",
    "the mac protocol is designed keeping in mind the application and limitations of the network .",
    "there are different mac protocols for centralised crn and distributed or adhoc crn . in the former case it utilises the base station to coordinate the various activities and resources among cr users while in the latter all the cr users work independently and share the resources among them intelligently .",
    "assume a scenario in which the cr users have high mobility the time synchronisation becomes difficult .",
    "the mac protocol in such cases have to be adjusted accordingly .",
    "thus the operation of mac protocol must be adaptive to suit specific application or specific environment , hence it makes standardization of protocol challenging .",
    "+ the mac protocol for crns is different from the classical mac protocol in the way that the mac in crn is closely coupled with the physical layer of the device .",
    "this is because for the mac to efficiently manage the channel , needs all the related information regarding the channel status .",
    "based on the rf status from the physical layer , the mac decides the sensing time and the schedule of transmission .",
    "mac layer is also responsible for the duration of the optimal sensing and transmission times and the method of searching for the vacant spectrum such that the performance is optimal[8 ] .",
    "channel has to be sensed at regular intervals to detect for any primary user activity .",
    "it is clear that high sensing time ensures correct detection of the pu activity while reduces throughput whereas the large transmission time guarantees high throughput while increasing the probability of false alarm and result in unwanted interference with the primary users .",
    "hence an optimal solution is suggested in [ 9 ] based on numerical optimization . + the mac protocols are generally based on the type of cognitive radio networks i.e. the mac protocols can primarily be divided into mac for centralised crn and mac for adhoc crn .",
    "the mac protocols could also be divided into time slotted or random access or hybrid protocol depending upon the type of its working .",
    "one of the main challenges in the spectrum access is control channel assignment .",
    "control channel is used for the cr users to coordinate among themselves and exchange control messages .",
    "this channel must be free from any interruption by the pus .",
    "one solution is to allocate an unlicensed channel for transmitting the control signals like the ism band .",
    "the problem with this solution is that the control channel becomes highly crowded with the large number of cognitive users sending control messages .",
    "hence at some point the performance of the network deteriorates due to channel saturation .",
    "however there is another solution like dynamically changing control channels . in this",
    "the control channel is allocated from one of the vacant channels and the channel keeps on changing with the activity of the primary users and according to the hopping sequence of the cr nodes .",
    "following section gives a brief of some of the existing mac protocols for crns .",
    "centralised crns have a central base station which manages the network activities , synchronisation and the coordinate the activities among nodes .",
    "generally the base station is static and the cr users are at one hop distance from the base station .",
    "hence the centralised crns allow an efficient coordination among the cr users in collecting network environment information .",
    "the mac protocol described in [ 10 ] is based on the carrier sense multiple access ( csma ) and uses one transceiver per cr user .",
    "the protocol proposed allows both the pu and the cr users to transmit simultaneously without affecting the pus performance .",
    "the pu operate on classical csma protocol and undertake the carrier sensing for a time @xmath0 .",
    "the cr users also work on the csma protocol and they sense the channel for time @xmath1 . however the sensing time for pu is less than that of cr users ( @xmath2 ) so as to give more priority to the primary users , as shown in figure [ fig21 ] .",
    "after the sensing phase the nodes send the request to send ( rts ) and subsequently receive the clear to send ( cts ) . for each negotiation",
    "the cr users send only one data packet .",
    "this helps reduce the interference level of the primary users .",
    "the base station decides the transmission power depending upon the distance of the cr users from the base station and the noise power level .",
    "the ieee 802.22 is the wireless regional area network ( wran ) standard for the cognitive radio networks [ 11 ] .",
    "it is proposed for rural broadband wireless access .",
    "this mac protocol is for the centralised crns .",
    "it proposes to use the tv white space 54 - 862 mhz with the range of the network lying between 17 - 33 km .",
    "the base station manages all the spectrum sharing and access among all the cr users in its premise . in the downstream direction ,",
    "time - division multiplexing is used , while in the upstream demand based tdma assignment is utilised .",
    "ieee 802.22 mac employs a hierarchy based frame structure in which the superframes are of duration 160 ms and each superframe is divided into 16 frames of size 10 ms each .",
    "the ieee 802.22 mac can also be operated without a dedicated ccc .",
    "the su scans for vacant tv spectrum on start - up .",
    "the base station meanwhile broadcast the superframes in the vacant channels .",
    "the su choose one of the vacant channels and receive control information from the base station on that channel and begins its communication .",
    "in the distributed crn there is no central base station to coordinate the activities of the cr users .",
    "the various protocols are discussed as follows .",
    "the cognitive radio enabled multichannel channel mac protocol ( cream - mac ) [ 12 ] utilises a ccc for channel contention .",
    "each cr user has sensors which sense for vacant channel .",
    "the ccc is either a dedicated ccc or one of the most unused licensed channels .",
    "the nodes contend on the ccc using the binary exponential backoff - based ieee 802.11 with distributed coordination function ( dcf ) .",
    "once a channel is reserved by a particular user all the nodes make sure not to contend for that channel .",
    "this removes any chance for collision .      the dynamically hopping control channel based mac protocol is proposed in [ 13 ] . in cases where a dedicated ccc is unavailable the hopping based control channel could be successful .",
    "each cr user keeps on changing its channel according to its channel sequence .",
    "each cr user stays on a particular channel for a definite amount of time .",
    "each su transmits a beacon signal along with its channel hopping sequence on every vacant channel it switches to . any user desiring to communicate with this user follows the channel hopping sequence of its destination node .",
    "hence both the cr users follow the same sequence and send data packets .",
    "if the channel is unavailable due to primary user activity the cr users wait for switching over to next channel in the channel hopping sequence .",
    "+ the problem with the dynamically hopping control channel is that it introduces unnecessary delays in the communication because tracking of control channel is time consuming process .",
    "the synchronised medium access control ( sync - mac ) proposed in [ 14 ] is a mac protocol that does not either requires a ccc or a hopping based control channel for its operation .",
    "hence eliminates any chance for control channel saturation or introducing unnecessary delays .",
    "each node has two radios per node , one for listening control messages on the channel while the other is used for data transfer . the time is divided into time slots . each user scan for vacant channels and listen to the control messages .",
    "a node desiring to send data sends a control packet to reserve for the channel .",
    "after successful contention it starts sending the data on this channel .",
    "the protocol has a dedicated radio for listening hence the hidden terminal problem is removed .",
    "figure [ fig22 ] shows 3 channels with the control and data slots in their respective slots .",
    "the problem with the protocol is that the vacant channel is used only once hence the efficiency decreases .",
    "+        there are many mac protocols for the cognitive radio adhoc networks that mainly employ tdma mechanism either at control channel or at the data transmission .",
    "these protocols generally use the ccc for negotiating among themselves .",
    "some of these are as follows .",
    "cognitive packet reservation multiple access ( cog - prma ) is a mac protocol for the cr users which shares the channel with the tdma primary user [ 15 ] .",
    "the channel access time is divided into frames which are further divided into time slots , which makes it closely resemble to tdma . whenever a cr node has a packet to send it contends and reserves the available time slot using the slotted aloha mechanism .",
    "there is a special sensing mini - slot at the starting of the time slot to sense whether the pu is transmitting in that slot or not .",
    "on detecting for an idle slot the cr users contend for the slot and reserve them for their transmission .",
    "the node releases the slot after it has sent its packet . after the release of the slot",
    ", the other cr users can send their packets using the same mechanism .",
    "in [ 16 ] the authors have proposed a mac protocol which employs a ccc for carrying out slot contention and reservation .",
    "the system is divided into fixed length frames .",
    "each frame is further divided into sensing period , atim period and communication period .",
    "communication period is further divided into time slots for data transmissions .",
    "the nodes sense the channels in the sensing period for any pu activity and maintains a channel occupancy list . in the atim period",
    "the nodes switch to the ccc to contend for the channel and time slot .",
    "the real - time traffic is given high priority by allowing the nodes to contend the slots first .",
    "figure [ fig23 ] shows the frame structure employed in the proposed protocol .",
    "the protocol uses various interval times , for which a node waits before contention .",
    "this time is low for real time traffic and high for non - real time traffic .    ]",
    "the mac protocol for tdma based crns is proposed in [ 17 ] .",
    "the primary users are transmitting on the specific time slots hence some of the slots are left vacant .",
    "these are used by the cr nodes .",
    "this protocol consists of a ccc for communicating with the spectrum broker ( responsible for channel allocation ) and spectrum sensing .",
    "there are two transceivers per cr node , one tuned to the ccc and other is sdr which is capable of tuning to one of the primary channels .",
    "the control channel has three phases , allocation phase , request phase and sensing phase . in the allocation phase",
    "the spectrum broker sends a list of node i d with the channel allocated to each . in the sensing",
    "phase the nodes sense their allocated channel .",
    "if the number of slots in the request phase is greater than the cr users then slotted aloha is followed otherwise tdma is followed for slot request .",
    "the multi - channel cognitive radio mac protocol ( mcr - mac ) is proposed in [ 18 ] .",
    "this protocol applies tdma and multi - channel to increase network throughput .",
    "csma / ca mechanism is employed to access the ccc for distributed coordination .",
    "this protocol solves the hidden incumbent node problem by using cooperative notification by the surrounding nodes .",
    "+ the use of common control channel causes a bottle neck in the system with high node density .",
    "there would be many nodes desiring to use ccc simultaneously hence the communication deteriorates .",
    "this is known as channel saturation problem .",
    "most of the protocols proposed in the literature use ccc .",
    "the solution to ccc is proposed in dh - mac where the author propose a hopping based control channel .",
    "this also has drawbacks like the delay in the system increases . to solve these problem we propose a novel mac protocol in this thesis .",
    "the proposed protocol neither uses a dedicated ccc or a hopping based control channel .",
    "the vacant spaces in the spectrum act as control channel for some time and act as data slots for some time . the time is divided into time slots .",
    "the channels are scanned and whenever the channel is found vacant the secondary user transmissions are carried out .",
    "there are two phases namely control phase and data phase . in the control phase users",
    "send their requests in their respective time slot . while in the data phase the users send data packets in their allocated time slots",
    ". + the proposed protocol maintains qos by allowing users to request slots by sending their priorities in the control phase .",
    "the user with high priority is allocated the slot first .",
    "there are many protocols proposed in the literature to allow priority for real - time data traffic but it fails to suggest a solution for malicious user .",
    "a malicious user can act in such a way that it always gets access to the vacant channel , while creating loss for honest cr nodes .",
    "our protocol uses the previous data slot allocation results to adjust the priorities of all the users .",
    "hence even the low priority cr node also gets a fair chance to transmit .",
    "+ power control is very important in case the nodes are battery operated .",
    "the proposed protocol also discusses a mechanism to control transmission power of the nodes and also allows node to go into sleep mode to save their power .",
    "the following sections give a detailed description of proposed protocol along with the simulation results .",
    "in this section we present the proposed mac protocol named the adpative tdma mac protocol for cognitive radio network ( atm - crn ) . this protocol provides an energy efficient solution for increasing the spectrum utilization .",
    "it also maintains the quality of service(qos ) and guarantees a fair share of spectrum among the cognitive radio nodes .",
    "the atm - mac protocol for the cognitive radio adhoc networks is based on a non - common control channel .",
    "the non - ccc for communication increases the reliability of such a network .",
    "each cr node scans for the channels which are vacant i.e. the channels in which there is no primary user activity .",
    "it maintains a list of these channels in its database and updates it at different times .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows some cognitive radio nodes with the vacant channel detected by them .",
    "we have assumed that there is only one radio available per cr node .",
    "each channel is divided into uniform time slots .",
    "the transmission is done over the allocated time slot . the contention for data slots",
    "is done in the specific time slots in the tdma frame .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the outline of the packet sequence transmission .",
    "there are mainly two types of sequences , control packet sequence and data packet sequence .",
    "+ a superframe is the time starting from quiet period to the end of data packet sequence .          quiet period in cognitive radio",
    "is used to sense the channel for any primary user activity .",
    "the quiet period is the time when all the nodes hear the spectrum for any pu activity .",
    "this is a minimum amount of time for which the cr users should sense the channel so that they can deterministically say that the primary users are not active in this channel or not .",
    "this depends on the type of communication carried out by the primary users .",
    "once the primary users had subsided , the channel is sensed for @xmath3 seconds .",
    "this is the duration of quiet period .",
    "the channel is sensed continuously at regular intervals for the return of the primary users .",
    "this interval s duration is taken as @xmath4 seconds .          in the control packet sequence each node broadcast a control packet over the network .",
    "control packet include details like source i d , priority index , number of slots requested , destination node i d and transmission power of the control packet as shown in fig [ fig3 ] .",
    "their description are as follows .",
    "* source i d * : the node i d of the cr node sending control packet .",
    "priority index * : indicates the priority on which the network should process its request .",
    "it is calculated using the data type , number of packets in the queue and waiting time of the packets in the queue .",
    "the algorithm used for this calculation is priority index calculator ( pic ) described later .",
    "* number of slots requested * : number of slots that are required by the node for the transmission of packet .",
    "each data slot is of fixed duration . according to the size of packet",
    "the node can calculate the number of slots required for transmission .",
    "4 .   * receiving node i d * : the destination i d to which the packet has to be sent ( could be to a particular user or can be a broadcast ) . in case",
    "the packet is to be broadcast this i d column has a special entry indicating broadcast . 5 .",
    "* transmission power * : the transmission power at which the packet is being sent .",
    "the control sequence comprises of one new user slot ( nus ) and several current users slots ( cus ) as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the cus is reserved for sending of control packet by the current users in the channel .",
    "the nus slot is reserved for the new users who want to take part in the communication for that channel .",
    "the new users send their control packets on nus using csma / cd mechanism .",
    "the duration of this slot is twice the duration of the cus .",
    "this is to ensure that if there are many users contending for this slot atleast there could be one cr user which could successfully send his control packet over this nus . + the number of control slots is adaptive to the number of active cr users in the network .",
    "all the users have the record of how many users are taking active part in the network and hence the number of cus is also known to all the users .",
    "this mechanism allows for efficient use of the spectrum with no slot left vacant and also reduces the latency in the end - to - end delivery of packets . if a user in the cus leaves the channel its cus slot is healed by the successive user in the sequence by shifting their control slots in the next superframe .",
    "this concept would be further described in the working of the protocol .",
    "+ the transmission power of the packets are sent to all the nodes in the control packet .",
    "all the nodes receive the control packet and the power of the packet received .",
    "the nodes then compute the received and transmitted power to figure out how far the nodes are ?",
    "thus the cognitive radio nodes can adjust the power intelligently .",
    "this has two advantages , firstly , the power of the cr nodes are saved and secondly , the probability of interference with the primary users is also reduced .",
    "+ along with the above five components the packets also contain the synchronisation bits ( 12 bits ) for coherent detection at the receiver and the indicator bits .",
    "indicator bits are the bits added to indicate the type of packet .",
    "this is of 4 bits .",
    "table [ tab1 ] indicates the different type of packets with their respective indicator bits .",
    "these two components are added to all the packets whether be control packet or data packet .",
    "+    .description of indicator bits [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this section we will propose some modifications in the protocol to improve its throughput and overall its efficiency .",
    "+ every node in the network has the information about the distance of other nodes in the network .",
    "this is obtained by operating on the sent and received power to know the snr . during the data transmission phase",
    "the nodes can use this snr calculated to suitably modify the modulation scheme like qpsk , 16-qam , 64-qam for transmission over their allocated data slots .",
    "this increases the overall throughput of the system and achieves channel utilisation as the data transmitted per unit time slot increases .",
    "also the snr is also maintained which enables the system to combat against any channel deterioration .",
    "this mechanism enables the system to reconfigure itself according to the channel parameters .",
    "+ there could be scenarios in which pu activity is very frequent but the duration of pu activity is very small . in this case",
    "the lenght of superframe has to be made shorter so that the channel is sensed frequently .",
    "we propose to use multiple quiet periods in between the superframe .",
    "subsequently the length of the superframe comprising of control sequence , data sequence and multiple quiet periods could be increased .",
    "the duration of superframe , as we stated earlier , is based on the pattern of pu activity .",
    "this is bounded by the quiet periods .",
    "hence , when we introduce the quiet periods in between the length of superframe can now be made significantly larger .",
    "this technique enables us to cause less disturbance in pu operation as well as also allow the cr users to make full use of the available spectrum .",
    "this also reduces the overhead in control packet transmission as the control packets are transmitted once per superframe , where superframe length has increased significantly",
    ". + the usability of the spectrum can further be increased by using directional antennas . during the control sequence phase where the control packets are broadcast over to all the nodes",
    ", we can use directional antenna to know the direction of transmission . at the end of this control sequence",
    ", all the nodes can have the knowledge of the topology with the distance and direction of other nodes .",
    "hence during the data transmission phase the transmissions could be done in one direction i.e. direction towards the receiver .",
    "hence this could enable the reuse of same data slot by other users geographically .",
    "this could increase the throughput tremendously .",
    "in this article , we have tried to solve the link layer problem in the cognitive radio networks .",
    "we have proposed an adaptive tdma based mac protocol for cognitive radio networks .",
    "we have discussed the various recent protocols proposed in the literature and stated the limitations of these .",
    "this has motivated us to develop a novel protocol which can surpass these limitations .",
    "the adaptive tdma mac protocol divides time into time slots for communication of control and data traffic .",
    "this does not require a dedicated control channel for its operation , hence removes problems like channel saturation and availability of such band .",
    "the significant contribution of the protocol apart from being energy efficient is that it ensures fairness among nodes and maintain qos .",
    "+ we have simulated the mac protocol over ns-2 and compared it with the common control channel based mac protocol .",
    "we have seen the effect on throughput with the variation in different parameters like quiet period duration , super frame duration and primary user activity .",
    "we have also talked about the resilience of our protocol in case of presence of a malicious user .",
    "we have also derived the expressions for power evaluation of our protocol and theoretical maximum throughput .",
    "main results of our protocol are as follows :    * protocol maintained qos by allowing higher throughput for high priority data traffic and low throughput for subsequently low priority data traffic . *",
    "performance in presence of malicious user was fair with a good amount of throughput ensured for low priority nodes .",
    "* energy efficiency of the protocol is seen to be significant with a high amount of power being saved .",
    "* our protocol ensured maximum use of the available spectrum with no part of the spectrum left without any transmission .    along with the analysis and simulation of our mac protocol we also proposed some improvements to reduced the overload in transmitting control packets and increase efficiency of our system .",
    "we also proposed schemes for high data transfer over the data slots .",
    "our protocol could be used efficiently in cognitive radio adhoc networks and cognitive radio sensor networks .",
    "the protocol provides an optimality between throughput and energy efficiency .",
    "this protocol could be also be used in cognitive radio systems for home surveillance applications .      *",
    "a routing protocol has to be developed in accordance with this protocol , so that the system becomes more efficient .",
    "* study and further implementation of the proposed improvements in section 4.x are to be carried out .",
    "* performance of the protocol has to be compared with various other protocols in the literature . *",
    "evaluation and modification of the protocol for various primary network scenarios like tv white spaces , radio spectrum etc .",
    "need to be done .",
