    "<S> given the relative dearth of examples of pr- or tm - based heavy fermion compounds , such a search is needed if we are to better understand their possible , hybridized ground states . </S>",
    "<S> + although the scheme outlined above for searching for pr - based hf systems is much harder that associated with similar searches for yb- or ce - based systems , all of these examples , so far , are springing off of the more or less guaranteed entropy associated with each of these rare earths hund s rule ground state multiplet , @xmath39 . in terms of preserving entropy to low enough temperatures , </S>",

    "<S> the sudden loss of fluctuations as the sample jumps deep into the af / ortho state ( via the first order phase transition ) is thought to be the reason for the absence of sc on the `` underdoped '' side of the phase diagram .    the pressure dependence of pure cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> the moral here being that if a compound is highly tunable , then it is also very sensitive to small , perhaps unintentional perturbations associated with growth or measurement ; caveat emptor !    the fragile magnetism manifest by cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is not only remarkable , even bordering on pathological , but it also serves as another step in the progression away from the guaranteed entropy and magnetism of a kramers - ion rare earth , to the less guaranteed entropy / magnetism of the non - kramer s rare earth , to far from guaranteed , or even likely , magnetism in transition metal based intermetallic systems . in the same way prag@xmath0 in , and the related prpb@xmath2 @xcite , can lose the entropy associated with the @xmath29 doublet via a structural phase transition that changes the point symmetry of the pr - ion , cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 can lose its fe - based magnetism through the t - ct structural phase transition that leads to a reduction both the correlations ( coulomb @xmath59 ) and the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> both of these reductions work together to lower the stoner parameter , @xmath61 , an lead to a loss of local moment like behavior on the fe site @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> indeed , some have argued that nature ( the abstract , anthropomorphic manifestation , not the journal ) has a death - wish for experimental physicists and solid state chemists since many of the promising and exciting systems in the post - high-@xmath49 world have increasingly involved the use of elements and compounds most commonly used as rat - poison , plot devices in murder mysteries , and bombs / fireworks . </S>",
    "<S> we will come to the difficulty of this search in greater detail soon , but first , let s better delineate the phrase `` fragile magnetism '' some more . + although driving a magnetic transition temperature to zero is a highly desired aspect of a fragile magnet , it is not a defining property ; mathematically speaking it is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition . </S>",
    "<S> this is most clearly illustrated by returning , briefly , to the @xmath19-shell physics of the rare earths . </S>",
    "<S> gd has a very robust local moment with no significant cef splitting due to its hund s rule groundstate being @xmath62 ( i.e. @xmath63 ) . </S>",

    "<S> , generally have a non - magnetic rare earth such as y , lu or even la substituted for gd on the rare earth site . as this happens the magnetic ordering temperature will be suppressed and ultimately head toward zero temperature , generally passing through a spin glass phase as the relative gd content approaches zero @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it should be noted , though , that such a suppression of the magnetic ordering temperature is not what we mean by `` fragile magnetism '' . </S>",
    "<S> if this were the case , virtually every rare earth based compound would qualify , since in most cases non - magnetic dilution is possible . in this example of gd - ( y </S>",
    "<S> / lu / la ) dilution it is anticipated that the size of the effective moment as well as the size of the ordered moment ( per gd ion ) remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this relative invariance of the effective as well as ordered moment makes the magnetism robust rather than fragile . </S>",
    "<S> another way of thinking about this is to appreciate that , as the magnetic transition temperature is reduced , no new mode of conduction electron / magnetic moment interaction or crossover is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the local moment interaction between the conduction electrons and the gd remains fundamentally the same . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be contrasted with the kondo systems such as the ce- or yb - based compounds discussed earlier . in the case of these hybridizing compounds , </S>",
    "<S> if a magnetic ordering temperature can be dropped enough , the hybridization between the @xmath19-shell and the conduction electrons leads to a reduced moment and an enhanced electronic specific heat component . to some extent </S>",
    "<S> , the concept of `` fragile magnetism '' is associated with the ordering of moments that are themselves `` fragile '' in some manner ; moments that can diminish in size and/or increasingly interact with conduction band through channels that can give rise to effects other than those simply associated with the rkky interaction . </S>",
    "<S> + we can see this distinction between fragile and non - fragile , transition metal magnetism in what , at cursory glance , might appear to be rather similar systems : lacrsb@xmath2 and lacrge@xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both of these compounds becomes ferromagnetic near 100 k , with @xmath64 k for lacrsb@xmath2 and @xmath65 k for lacrge@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the vanadium analogues to each compound : lavsb@xmath2 and lavge@xmath2 , are non - moment bearing , pauli paramagnets . </S>",
    "<S> figures 8a and 9a show the pressure dependence of @xmath66 for lacrsb@xmath2 and lacrge@xmath2 respectively @xcite . whereas the curie temperature of lacrsb@xmath2 is essentially invariant for pressures up to nearly 6 gpa , for lacrge@xmath2 @xmath66 drops precipitously , going to zero near 2 gpa with a probably antiferromagnetic phase transition appearing above @xmath66 near 50 k and 1.6 gpa pressure and itself going to zero near 6 gpa .    the effects of substituting non - magnetic v for cr </S>",
    "<S> can also be studied for signs of fragile , or non - fragile magnetism . for la(cr@xmath42v@xmath43)sb@xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath47 increases the clear signature of ferromagnetic ordering changes to one more compatible with a complex , or cluster glass - like ordering which still manifests ( i ) hysteresis and ( ii ) large saturated or saturating values in low temperature @xmath67 plots @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figures 8b,8c present the evolution of ( i ) the paramagnetic , curie - weiss temperature , @xmath68 , ( ii ) the paramagnetic effective moment , and ( iii ) the saturated ( or lower limit for saturating ) moment in the low temperature state as a function of vanadium content , @xmath47 . for all intents and purposes , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of all three of these quantities for la(cr@xmath42v@xmath43)sb@xmath2 as @xmath47 increases is very similar to what would be expected of their evolution in a ( gd@xmath69lu@xmath70)@xmath71 ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 being non - moment bearing second and third elements ) intermetallic compound . in other words , cr is acting like a robust , definitely non - fragile moment . </S>",
    "<S> both the pressure dependence and the substitution dependence of lacrsb@xmath2 rank it as a transition metal based , intermetallic compound with non - fragile magnetism .    for la(cr@xmath42v@xmath43)ge@xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> single crystalline samples with @xmath74 and pure lavge@xmath2 ( @xmath75 ) could be grown and studied @xcite . as @xmath47 increased from @xmath44 for pure lacrge@xmath2 toward @xmath76 not only does the curie temperature drop by over a factor of two , but , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 9b , ( i ) the paramagnetic , curie - weiss temperature , @xmath68 , ( ii ) the paramagnetic effective moment , and ( iii ) the saturated moment in the low temperature , ordered state all decrease significantly . both @xmath68 and the saturated moment drop so dramatically that they appear to extrapolate to zero in the @xmath77 region . taken together with the relatively large pressure dependence of the low temperature magnetic state </S>",
    "<S> , lacrge@xmath2 appears to be an example of a transition metal based compound that does manifest a fragile state . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> ongoing measurements up to pressures of 7 gpa and applied magnetic fields as high as 14 t indicate that lacrge@xmath2 has a `` wing - structure '' in the @xmath78 phase diagram @xcite similar to what was first found for ferromagnetic uge@xmath0 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> lacrsb@xmath2 and lacrge@xmath2 provide a clearly contrasting pair of cr - based ferromagnets with very similar stoichiometries , transition temperatures , and even saturated moments ( although lacrsb@xmath2 does have a significantly larger effective moment than lacrge@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although experimental measurements of either pressure and/or substitution effects reveal fragility in the magnetic state found in lacrge@xmath2 and robustness in the magnetic state found in lacrsb@xmath2 , such measurements take months of experimental effort as well as elements , crucibles , furnace time , pressure cells and cryogens . </S>",
    "<S> + clearly it would be a great step forward if focused computational studies could reliably indicate some degree of fragility . </S>",
    "<S> the key question then is , what criterion can be both useful and readily calculated </S>",
    "<S> ? figures 5 - 9 provide a potential answer : fragile magnets appear to be fragile both in terms of substitution and pressure , at the grossest level , to band filling and band width , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this means that instead of having to contend with the complexity or approximations associated with substitution , fragile magnetism can be tested by the application of either positive or negative pressure _ in silica_. the determination of the ordered moment as a function of pressure may be the most effective method , although if determinations of ordering temperature , or size of paramagnetic , fluctuating moment as a function of pressure are possible , then these would be fine too . in theory </S>",
    "<S> , this is a task that should be computationally tractable with only crystal structure as the input . </S>",
    "<S> clearly any further information about the nature of the ambient pressure magnetic ordering will only facilitate and refine the computational work . the @xmath24fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath24 = ca , sr , ba ) series as well as </S>",
    "<S> the lacr@xmath79 ( @xmath72 = sb and ge ) set of compounds offer clear bench marks for testing and refining of methodologies . materials such as zrzn@xmath0 @xcite and sc@xmath2 in @xcite can also serve as tests . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we are currently working on other transition metal based systems , getting pressure dependencies of magnetic ordering so as to widen the set of compounds that can be used to refine , test and calibrate potential computational methodologies .    before declaring victory , though </S>",
    "<S> , we need to appreciate that finding metallic , transition metal based fragile magnetic systems consists of two parts , ( 1 ) finding metallic , transition metal based systems that are magnetic ( or close to being magnetic ) and ( 2 ) determining which of them may be fragile . we have discussed the second part in some detail and even have outlined how computational methods could have an impact on this search , but this still leaves the first , key step to discuss and appreciate . coming from a background of rare earth magnetism with occasional visits to the realms of permanent magnet and oxide physics , it was a bit of a shock just how uncommon transition metal based , compounds that are metallic and magnetic ( as in moment bearing ) actually are . </S>",
    "<S> ( at some level this is a blind spot many of researchers in this field share as can be witnessed by the apparent assumption that ni was probably moment bearing in the rni@xmath0b@xmath0c compounds when they were discovered @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> once you start paying attention , though , it becomes more and more apparent that even @xmath80-shell transition metals ( with the conspicuous exception of mn ) are reluctant to be moment bearing except in compounds with very high relative concentrations of cr , fe , co and ni . to make this point clear , for the @xmath81ge@xmath0 and @xmath81si@xmath0 series ( @xmath6 = fe , co , and ni ) iron , cobalt and nickel are non - moment bearing ( with a possible exception of iron in lufe@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite ) .    in order to find transition metal based , metallic systems that manifest fragile magnetism , </S>",
    "<S> a superset of transition metal based metallic systems that manifest magnetic behavior is a prerequisite </S>",
    "<S> . this may be the rate limiting step . </S>",
    "<S> we can take ternary compounds containing cr , fe , co and/or ni as an example . </S>",
    "<S> there are roughly 11,000 entries in pearson s crystal data @xcite when the search is limited to ternary compounds excluding ones with oxygen ( often insulators ) , be or tl ( very toxic ) , and @xmath19 ( very non - fragile , local moment magnetism ) and @xmath82 ( radioactive ) elements . based on experience with subsets of this list , out of these @xmath83 entries , somewhat over half of this number can be discarded as multiple entries , alloys , disordered systems , etc . , leaving somewhere around 2,000 - 4,000 distinct , stoichiometric compounds to sort through . of these , the majority are known only as crystal structures with either no , or virtually no , temperature dependent thermodynamic or transport data that would allow for the inference of possible magnetic phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge now becomes finding which ones of these may be magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> this is a herculean task , one that again can benefit from any suggestions or guidance that computational work can offer .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> we are pursuing a hybrid algorithm for deciding which of these compounds to test . clearly any compounds with reported phase transitions that may be magnetic rise to the top of our list . </S>",
    "<S> after this , compounds that either have compelling structures or have some indication from computation that they are more stable as moment bearing , ferromagnetic systems than as non - moment bearing . </S>",
    "<S> even though this calculation is done for the @xmath84 wave vector ( ferromagnet ) , it often gives some indication of a predisposition to ordering , even if it is antiferromagnetic . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully over the next few years we will find a superset of metallic , transition metal based magnetic compounds that can then be reduced to a subset of fragile magnetic systems . </S>",
    "<S> + to wrap up , in this paper we have tried to outline some of the current ideas and themes in our own research efforts to better understand the evolution of correlated electron materials out of what we think of as fragile magnetic / preserved entropy states . in @xmath19-shell systems </S>",
    "<S> there are a myriad of possible exotic symmetries and degeneracies associated with the cef splitting of the hund s rule ground state multiplet . </S>",
    "<S> yb - based systems offer a clear test of our simplest understanding of quantum criticality , with kramers based moments being tuned or perturbed by field , pressure , and/or doping . </S>",
    "<S> pr - based systems offer alternate mechanisms for preserving the low temperature entropy and provide examples of how cef splitting can be used to provide novel entropy / symmetry constraints . for both yb- and pr - based systems </S>",
    "<S> , the characteristic temperature scales will be low . </S>",
    "<S> higher temperature scales are promised by the metallic , transition metal based , fragile antiferromagents . </S>",
    "<S> this class of materials is less well defined than yb- or pr - based compounds . </S>",
    "<S> as outlined above , they are harder to find , but they are definitely out there . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of their ranks and the mapping of their diversities will hopefully provide us with a clearer understanding of what are the necessary features for the development of high temperature superconductivity as well as what is the scope of other states possible as the magnetism is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the next decade will be one of growth and exploration . </S>",
    "<S> it will be an exciting and exhilarating time . </S>",
