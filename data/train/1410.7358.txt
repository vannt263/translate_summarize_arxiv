    ", the relation @xmath234 implies that the third harmonic dressehaus term dominates the decay of the helix .",
    "more specifically , the spin relaxation rates for the two subbands due to the random rashba coupling @xmath235 and the third harmonic dresselhaus coupling @xmath236 are , @xmath237 and @xmath238,@xcite respectively . here",

    "although here the random rashba coupling has a minor effect on our results , we emphasize that this random rashba contribution could be important in , for instance , symmetric si / ge [ or gaas ( 110 ) ] wells@xcite and insb narrow gap semiconductor wells.@xcite in the former case , only the random rashba coupling contributes to the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation , while in the latter case , a large so constant can possibly enhance the random rashba contribution .",
    "we have performed a detailed and realistic self - consistent calculation for gaas wells in a wide range of well widths and potential profiles , thus determining all the relevant so couplings for wells with one and/or two subbands populated . in particular , for narrower wells with only one subband occupied , we have simulated the rashba and dresselhaus couplings for the samples experimentally investigated by koralek _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and have found very good agreement .",
    "we have also determined the symmetry point at which the rashba and dresselhaus coefficients are matched . by increasing the well width @xmath0 beyond the range of the samples in ref .  , we have investigated the regime in which two subbands are occupied .",
    "interestingly , we find that for wider wells the rashba coupling @xmath2 can vanish due to ehnrenfest s theorem even for asymmetric wells , while @xmath1 is always nonzero .",
    "this could be important for suppressing the spin - relaxation processes of both the dyakonov - perel @xcite and elliott - yafet @xcite types within the second subband .",
    "in addition , we have calculated several contributions to the so couplings due to the structural , hartree , and doping potentials , thus showing that the magnitudes and signs of the so couplings follow from the interplay of all these contributions . for very wide wells with varying degrees of potential asymmetry @xmath120 , we find the interesting possibility of tuning the rashba and dresselhaus couplings to symmetry points such that @xmath38 , @xmath210 , and @xmath217 for a given well width @xmath0 and distinct asymmetry parameter @xmath120 . in this study",
    "we kept the electron density fixed while changing the electron occupancy by varying the well width .",
    "we point out that the electron occupancy can also be tuned via an external gate at fixed well width , thus widening the scope for new experiments . finally , as rashba and sherman observed,@xcite the dependence of the hole so coupling on the subband occupation is nontrivial .",
