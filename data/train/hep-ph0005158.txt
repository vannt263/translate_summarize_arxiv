    "despite the many successes of the standard cosmology , we still do not know the composition and the amount of energy density in our universe ( for a review , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of matter which does not emit much light is certain from the fact that stars and other luminous matter contribute only a tiny fraction ( about 0.004)@xcite of the critical energy density ( required for a spatially flat universe ) while the orbits of stars around galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) indicate that the gravitating energy density is about ten times larger . to the critical energy density as @xmath0 .",
    "since the critical energy density is determined by the hubble expansion rate which is uncertain , we will use the usual parameterization @xmath1 and often write the energy density as @xmath2 value instead . ] from a cosmological point of view , a variety of observations , such as the peculiar motions of galaxies as well as the masses of clusters of galaxies , corroborate the existence of dark energy and indicate that @xmath3 , the ratio of the average matter - energy density in our hubble volume to the critical energy density , is about @xmath4 if the hubble expansion rate is about 70 km / s / mpc as the current observations indicate ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although without other constraints this dark energy density could be in the form of ordinary baryonic matter ( objects made of neutrons and protons ) , the standard model of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) calculations and the measurement of primeval abundance of deuterium gives strong evidence that the baryon density is @xmath5 which implies @xmath6 of about @xmath7 .",
    "hence , most of the matter energy density in the universe seems to be in the form of nonbaryonic dark matter ( nbdm ) .",
    "measurements of cosmological parameters will determine @xmath8 accurately , but are unlikely to help us know the actual character of the nbdm , since they mainly depend on its gravitational interactions .",
    "some information on nbdm collisional energy loss and clustering will also come from astrophysics information . for perhaps the most likely forms of nbdm we can hope to observe the actual particles in laboratory experiments , and calculate to a few percent accuracy the actual contribution to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the more likely extensions to the standard model of particle physics provide candidates for the nonbaryonic dark matter , candidates which existed even before the need for nbdm was established .",
    "indeed , given that these extensions to the standard model are theoretically compelling from particle physics considerations , without cosmological considerations , their provision of dark matter energy of the right order of magnitude abundance provides an independent hint at the existence of physics beyond the standard model . among the various candidates for this nonbaryonic dark matter ( see e.g. @xcite ) , a typical unified supersymmetric theory with conserved r - parity will have a stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) that will probably constitute most of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "in addition , the non - baryonic dark energy would most likely consist of neutrino hot dark matter ( @xmath10hdm ) , axionic cdm ( acdm ) , and the cosmological constant ( @xmath11 ) . given a lagrangian for the unified theory ( ut ) and thermal equilibrium initial conditions for the fluid determining the cosmological evolution",
    ", one can calculate the dark matter content of our universe by solving the boltzmann equations .",
    "many other nbdm candidates have been proposed @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will only analyze the situations for neutrinos , axions , and lsps in some detail .",
    "similar conclusions hold for the rest . at appropriate places in the paper",
    "we will consider non - thermal evolution .",
    "the neutrino situation is simpler .",
    "once the cosmology is known and the neutrino masses are determined , one can compute the relic number of neutrinos , multiply by the masses , and obtain @xmath12 . if neutrinos have anomalous interactions they have to be included .",
    "the axion case is difficult .",
    "assume axions are observed in terrestrial detectors , and perhaps even information about them comes from astrophysical data .",
    "then the thermal density @xmath13 can be computed precisely enough @xcite . however , coherent oscillations of axion zero modes give non - thermal contributions @xmath14 that depend strongly on a `` misalignment '' factor , related to the value of the axion field at the confinement transition .",
    "we are aware of no way to determine @xmath14 , which can be the dominant contribution , so we conclude that it may not be possible to even know how much of the cdm is @xmath15 .",
    "the lsp case turns out to be difficult , but solvable .",
    "we first demonstrate that knowing the lsp mass , and even knowing its cross section on a nucleon , do not allow one to know its contribution to @xmath16 to better accuracy than an order of magnitude or so .",
    "part of this uncertainty arises from a current lack of knowledge of the phases of the soft supersymmetry breaking lagrangian ( @xmath17 ) , but even if one arbitrarily took all phases to be zero or @xmath18 at least a factor of six uncertainty in @xmath16 remains . and",
    "for an important question such as the composition of the cdm , one would not want to make unwarranted assumptions about the phases or other relevant parameters .",
    "we then show that knowing the relevant parameters of @xmath17 , and @xmath19 , to about 5% allows a determination of @xmath16 to similar accuracy .",
    "such measurements will be possible by combining data from hadron colliders , low energy ( _ e.g. _ electric dipole moments ) experiments , b - factories , and a lepton collider with a polarized beam and sufficient energy to produce several superpartners ( and appropriate luminosity ) .",
    "if wimps are observed in explicit ( i.e. , non - collider ) detection experiments ( direct underground wimp scattering on nuclei , or space - based , or indirectly via @xmath10 interactions from wimp annihilation in the sun or earth ) there are additional large uncertainties which we do not consider in this paper .",
    "these include going from wimp - nucleus to wimp - quark cross sections , local density and velocity distributions of wimps , how long antiprotons or positrons can persist in the galaxy , and so on .",
    "all of our results hold even if these other factors could be controlled .    in the next two sections we discuss the lsp case in detail , first analytically and then numerically",
    ". then we turn to some cosmological considerations , and examine the axion case . in all cases",
    "we assume that @xmath20 will be known accurately before it is needed to achieve a particle physics knowledge of @xmath8 , so we do not include errors in @xmath20 .",
    "we also assume that the usual boltzmann treatment is sufficient @xcite to estimate the possible uncertainties and that refinements of the calculational procedure necessary for more accurate calculation can be accomplished when appropriate",
    ". for examples of such refinements , see ref.@xcite and references therein .",
    "in this section , we give an analytic estimate for the uncertainties that can be expected in the calculation of lsp cdm , given that some of the parameters in the mssm has been measured to a certain accuracy . the most common situation for most parts of the mssm parameter space",
    "is when no other particle mass is within @xmath21 of the lsp mass @xmath22 @xcite . in that case",
    ", self - annihilation determines the relic abundance . assuming as usual that the annihilation products are in chemical thermal equilibrium with the massless degrees of freedom in a radiation dominated flat frw universe , the simplified boltzmann equation governing the relic abundance can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lsp volume density scaled by the cube of the temperature which sets the scale for the volume density of the photons , @xmath25 is the thermal averaged self annihilation cross section",
    ", @xmath26 is the scaled temperature , @xmath27 counts the degrees of freedom contributing to the entropy , and @xmath28 is the nonrelativistic approximation of the thermal equilibrium volume density of lsps . starting from a thermal equilibrium initial conditions , @xmath29 tracks @xmath30 until the freeze - out temeperature @xmath31 and then @xmath29 decouples from @xmath30 . approximating this decoupling to occur sharply at a particular temperature @xmath31 , one finds an expression for the relic density as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the critical energy density that only depends on the cosmology .",
    "the approximate expression for the freezeout temperature can be written as @xmath34+\\frac{1}{2}\\ln x_{f}}\\ ] ] @xmath35 propagating the error in quadratures , the fractional error is characterized by @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the uncertainty in parameter @xmath38 . neglecting the @xmath39 and @xmath40uncertainties , we can write @xmath41}{\\int _ { x_{0}}^{x_{f}}\\sqrt{g_{*}}\\sigv dx}\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that @xmath42 .",
    "we can approximate @xmath43where @xmath44 ( which is a good approximation in the region of the parameter space where the @xmath38 dependence is analytic ) and conclude @xmath45 hence , we conclude that @xmath46 where the strength of the errror contribution is determined by @xmath47which is what we expect .",
    "for example , consider a typical nonresonant self - annihilation cross section of an lsp going to two fermions through a sfermion exchange .",
    "we have @xmath48\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath51 dimensionless constants and @xmath52 is the fermion - sfermion - neutralino coupling . then considering the contribution of @xmath53 to the fractional error",
    ", we find to leading order in @xmath54 , @xmath55 which is about @xmath56 .",
    "considering the contribution of @xmath57 to the uncertainty , we find similarly @xmath58 which has a magnitude of about @xmath59 .",
    "finally we see that the coupling will also contribute @xmath60 showing that the abundance is most sensitive to the sfermion mass and the lsp - sfermion - fermion coupling .",
    "in addition we see that relative uncertainties in parameters are likely to lead to even larger relative uncertainties in @xmath16 .    the standard scalar neutralino cross section on protons @xcite",
    "is expressed as @xmath61 where the effective scalar interaction coupling @xmath62 is usually dominated by the cp - even higgs parton level exchange between quarks and neutralinos @xcite @xmath63.\\ ] ] the matrix element coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be extracted from pion - nucleon scattering using chiral perturbation theory and are subject to large uncertainties which are reflected in the neutralino - proton scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "the parton level couplings , on the other hand , depend entirely on the susy lagrangian parameters and higgs masses @xmath66 with the ( in general complex ) neutralino couplings to the light cp - even higgs @xmath67 and to the heavy higgs @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the higgs mixing angle .",
    "the quark - higgs couplings depend on weak isospin quantum number and we have for the up type quarks @xmath70 and for the down type quarks @xmath71 in the large @xmath72 limit @xmath73 and the @xmath74 coupling is enhanced by a factor of @xmath19 . as a result , for small values of @xmath19 ( less than 4 ) the cross section is dominated by the light higgs exchange while for large values of @xmath19 the heavy higgs exchange contribution prevails .",
    "in analogy to the analysis of the relic density we can determine accuracy of the cross section calculation as a function of the variation in individual parameters @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the variation coeficient corresponding to the uncertainty @xmath37 in parameter @xmath38 .",
    "assuming that there is indeed a dominant contribution from one of the higgs bosons , we find that the higgs and quark coupling both contribute to the uncertainty in a similar way @xmath77 and the higgs mass contribution to the uncertainty is @xmath78 while the cross section is largely insensitive to variations of the neutralino mass since the reduced mass of the system is very close to the mass of the proton .",
    "it is important to realize that the neutralino - higgs couplings depend crucially on the neutralino mixing matrix .",
    "both gaugino and higgsino components are required to participate if the couplings are not to vanish .",
    "the neutralino mass matrix depends on complex quantities @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 with potentially large phases @xcite which can significantly modify the lightest neutralino composition and subsequently its couplings to the higgs bosons .",
    "it is important to include these complex phases in the general analysis of the relic density and the neutralino proton cross section in order to be able to estimate the overall uncertainty in these quantities which can be achieved once the susy lagrangian parameters including the phases are measured .",
    "we illustrate the general behavior of the neutralino relic density and proton elastic cross section on a characteristic set of the mssm parameters which can provide neutralino relic abundance in the cosmologically relevant region and a cross section small enough to be allowed by direct detection experiments . since the neutralino scattering cross section grows with @xmath19 models with low and moderate values of @xmath19",
    "can easily satisfy direct detection constraints and still provide a significant neutralino abundance . in all of our numerical calculations we use the following reference set of parameters ",
    "@xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "this set has been chosen so that the resulting neutralino is predominantly a bino and the effects of the light higgs and z pole neutralino annihilation pole as well as any co - annihilation effects are minimized .",
    "our choice of parameters leads to the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 . since we are working in a general parametric framework ,",
    "the soft higgs masses can be chosen so that electroweak symmetry breaking conditions are satisfied .",
    "these numbers are not special , and only illustrate typical results .",
    "= 6.25 in    first let us turn to the discussion of the neutralino observables sensitivity to the cp - conserving parameters appearing in the supersymmetric lagrangian .",
    "obviously , the most important ones are @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath19 which enter into neutralino mass matrix and determine both the mass of the lightest neutralino @xmath94 and its higgs and lepton - slepton couplings .",
    "another significant variation comes from the change in the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson which influences the neutralino - higgs couplings and the heavy cp - even higgs boson mass .",
    "the dominant slepton exchange contribution to the neutralino annihilation cross section depends crucially on the slepton mass while the scattering cross section is insensitive to the scalar masses .",
    "1 shows the dependence of the neutralino relic density and proton cross section on the relative variation of the important parameters within a @xmath95 range . as shown in frame _ a ) _ , the relic density is mostly sensitive to variations in the slepton masses appearing in the dominant annihilation diagram  as the slepton mass increases the annihilation cross section is more suppressed and @xmath96 increases .",
    "all the other parameters enter the neutralino sector and their variations are reflected in the variations of the lsp mass and the lsp - slepton - lepton coupling .",
    "the most significant is the variation of the density with the bino mass @xmath79 which determines @xmath94 and subsequently the dominant @xmath97-wave contribution to the neutralino annihilation cross section .",
    "it is relatively stable with respect to changes in @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath19 since the annihilation cross section depends weakly on the neutralino composition . in summary ,",
    "the overall variation of @xmath96 is at most @xmath98 for any single parameter in the given range of the input susy parameters .    on the other hand",
    ", the spin independent part of the neutralino - proton scattering cross section depends crucially on the gaugino - higgsino composition of the lightest neutralino since both components take part in the neutralino - higgs interaction .",
    "this fact is reflected in frame _ b ) _ which shows a comparable sensitivity to @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "it is obvious that for the given range of @xmath99 the change in @xmath100 can be as big as a factor of two .",
    "note that in our particular case ( @xmath84 ) the cross section is dominated by the light higgs boson exchange and consequently the sensitivity to @xmath72 is limited .",
    "as @xmath19 increases , the heavy higgs exchange takes over the cross section and the sensitivity to @xmath72 , which determines the heavy higgs boson mass , increases correspondingly .",
    "= 5.in    in order to estimate the accuracy with which we can determine the relic density and the proton scattering cross section once we have measured the susy parameters at a collider experiment we plot the range of both quantities when the susy parameters are all varied within a 20 % range from the central value .",
    "2 shows the resulting region in the @xmath96@xmath100 plane . in part of parameter space",
    "the variations of fig .",
    "1 can combine , and lead to much larger ranges of variation in @xmath96 .",
    "in particular , the points in the upper left region with small relic density result from non - linear effects associated with the presence of an s - channel light higgs exchange annihilation pole , which can drastically increase the annihilation cross section , and parameter points on the tail of the breit - wigner resonance have small neutralino relic density .",
    "this is a fairly generic situation since the allowed range for neutralino relic abundance imposes a limit on the neutralino mass .",
    "note that the 5% error region allows a reasonable determination of @xmath96 . to understand the weak constraints from direct detection experiments , imagine a horizontal line across fig.2 , with a height uncertainty coming from the nuclear physics and astrophysics ambiguities in extracting @xmath100 , and notice the resulting uncertainties in @xmath96 .",
    "= 4.75 in    next we examine the effects of soft susy phases on these questions .",
    "it has been demonstrated recently @xcite that all soft susy phases can be large . even if it turned out that some are smaller , _",
    "e.g. _ from future electric dipole moment experiments , others relevant here may not be .",
    "also , phases have two effects  not only do they directly enter the calculations @xcite of @xmath96 and @xmath100 , they also make measurement of other parameters such as @xmath19 more difficult , and impossible at lep or hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "we work in a phase parametrization consistent with @xcite and choose @xmath101 . in fig .",
    "3 we show the range of @xmath96 ( frame _ a ) _ ) and @xmath100 frame ( _ b ) _ ) as the two relevant phases entering the neutralino mass matrix @xmath102 and @xmath103 are varied in their full range while all other parameters are kept constant .",
    "it turns out that the relic abundance has two local minima and maxima and the range is bigger than an order of magnitude between the minimum and maximum .",
    "the neutralino proton cross section also varies by more than an order of magnitude but it is monotonous in the @xmath103- @xmath102 plane . from fig .",
    "3 it is clear that by neglecting the phases one can be missing a crucial part of the particle physics information needed to determine the lsp abundance .",
    "although the focus of our paper is examining the uncertainties in our knowledge of dark matter coming from particle physics , here we will briefly comment on some of the cosmological uncertainties related to the dark matter determination . specifically",
    ", we would like to emphasize a point that can easily be overlooked : only with a firm determination of the cosmological history can the particle physics data weigh the universe . to make this point concrete ,",
    "let us consider some possible difficulties with the usual approach to the dark matter calculation which we have assumed in our paper .",
    "first we will consider the effect of energy density behaving like a cosmological constant today .",
    "then , we will consider the situation when the dominant contribution to zero pressure dark energy is not a thermal relic .",
    "in such `` nonthermal '' cases , particle physics data generically can not determine the `` matter '' energy density contribution because `` history '' or boundary conditions of the particle physics may not be determined by a fundamental principle or dynamics .",
    "we will choose axionic dark matter to illustrate this point .",
    "such uncertainties are relevant to all forms of dark matter .",
    "there can also be extra entropy production which has to be included .",
    "let us first consider how the existence of energy density with a negative pressure @xcite(which we will for simplicity call @xmath104 ) affects the relic lsp density calculations .",
    "first , consider the boltzmann equations .",
    "suppose the spatial curvature is negligible as will be the case after inflation .",
    "then , we can start with the same boltzmann equation @xmath105 since conservation of entropy is still valid , we will have @xmath106 where @xmath107 in the usual scenario ,",
    "we assume radiation dominance and use @xmath108 this is still a good approximation because the temperature at which the relic density froze out is @xmath109 and we require that @xmath104 not destroy one of the pillars of standard cosmology and that @xmath110 be a monotonic function of time .",
    "hence , the rest of the formalism follows as usual for the determination of the freezeout temperature .",
    "as far as the evolution of the relic density after freezeout is concerned , there is no change from before again because the nucleosynthesis temperature is much lower than the freezeout temperature .    of course",
    ", if we do not require monotonic variation of @xmath104 then the above relation between the time and expansion rate may no longer valid and the relic abundance calculation may have to be modified .",
    "however , this is unlikely because to preserve the successes of bbn , the models of @xmath104 then must be fine tuned such that its energy is significant at the time of dark matter freezeout while being negligible at the time of bbn @xcite . in the unlikely event",
    "that such tuned history is that of our universe , then the dark matter energy density implied by the particle physics measurements may be significantly different from what we have calculated in this paper .",
    "axion scenarios offer an elegant solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "furthermore , pseudoscalars resembling axions are generically expected @xcite from effective theories arising from compactifications of string theories . unlike lsps , the axions are expected to naturally contribute significantly to the cosmological energy density even when the thermal relic abundance does not contribute significantly . even with the assumption of inflation and sufficiently low reheating temperature @xcite rendering possible axionic topological defect related contributions irrelevant , one must account for the fact that generically there may be coherent oscillations of the axion zero modes ( commonly called misalignment contribution@xcite ) giving a nonthermal contribution to the cosmological energy density with the magnitude @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the axion mass , @xmath113 is some known monotonically increasing function accounting for anharmonic effects ( @xmath114 , and @xmath115 is the `` amplitude '' of the oscillations of the axion field . the value of @xmath116 is essentially equal to the value of the axion field at the confinement transition .",
    "because there is no direct way to measure @xmath117 , even with a precise determination of @xmath112 , there will be a great uncertainty in the axionic contribution .",
    "this is in contrast with the most likely smaller @xcite thermal relic contribution of the axion which can be quite precisely determined once the mass of the axion is measured .",
    "indeed , most of the relic axion detection experiments such as electromagnetic spectrum observation of nearby clusters , as well as sikivie - type resonant microwave cavities immersed in strong magnetic fields , mostly measure the axion mass , and there is no obvious direct handle on the `` misalignment '' angle @xmath116 .",
    "indeed , @xmath116 may be most likely determined randomly from the space of all possible values , since above the confinement transition the axions have essentially zero mass .",
    "hence , in such `` nonthermal '' cosmological boundary condition dependent situations , the determination of the dark matter from particle physics data seems impossible .",
    "understanding the composition of our universe is one of the most fundamental issues we can study .",
    "we demonstrate that we can only be fully confident we have learned the answer if we can calculate from first principles and laboratory data for each type of matter x what @xmath0 is , and find agreement with cosmological measurement of @xmath118 . for neutrinos",
    "this can be done if their masses can be measured , or shown to be small compared to @xmath119 . for axions",
    "we have emphasized there does not seem to be a way to do this .    for the lsp it is possible to calculate @xmath16 if measurements of soft supersymmetry phases , and @xmath19 are made .",
    "unless such measurements are done , it is simply incorrect to suggest that detection of the lsp at a collider , or in a direct or indirect wimp experiment , means that the cold dark matter has been observed .",
    "indeed , there is a loose correlation of easier detection with smaller relic density .",
    "all measurements , of course , help constrain the situation , and the detection of the lsp will mean that _ some _ of the cdm has been observed  but perhaps only a fraction .",
