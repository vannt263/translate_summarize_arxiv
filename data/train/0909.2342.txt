    "entanglement , a key concept in quantum - information science @xcite , has also been playing a pivotal role in the study of quantum ( or , generally , nonclassical ) correlations and related consequences in many - body systems @xcite , especially quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) induced by varying parameters of system hamiltonian at zero temperature @xcite ( see also refs . @xcite for geometric approaches to qpts . ) . accordingly",
    ", many efforts have been made to find the possible relation between qpt in a system and nonanalyticities of , e.g. , pairwise entanglement of its ground state ( gs ) @xcite .",
    "for example , under some fairly general conditions , a classification of qpts in terms of pairwise entanglement has been provided in ref .",
    "besides , through density functional theoretical arguments , it has been shown that by an appropriate choice of entanglement measure ( either bi- or multipartite ) , one can study physical properties of a system near its critical points @xcite .",
    "it is thus evident that having a sufficiently strong entanglement measure which is able to detect entanglement regions of the gs ( in terms of the hamiltonian parameters ) in a more subtle way is of paramount importance .",
    "the difficulty of the issue , i.e. , quantifying quantum correlations , is mostly due to the existence of various types of entanglement in quantum many - body systems , such as free entanglement ( fe ) , bound entanglement ( be ) @xcite , and pairwise or multipartite entanglement @xcite , featuring also new phases for quantum matter ( e.g. , topological order @xcite ) . here",
    ", however , we shall concentrate only on be .    simply speaking , bound entangled states , in contrast to free entangled states , are those states which are not directly useful for quantum - information tasks such as teleportation @xcite .",
    "because of the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) property of bound entangled states ( in the bipartite case ) @xcite , their entanglement can not be distilled by any local operation and classical communication ; for a general review , see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the existence of non - ppt be , however , is still an open question @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , bound entangled states are still useful because , for example , cryptographically secure keys can be constructed from them @xcite , they can enhance the fidelity of conclusive teleportation  hence , the teleportation power  of another bipartite state @xcite , they manifest irreversibility in the entanglement formation - distillation cycle ( hence , also of interest in thermodynamics ) @xcite , and they have applications in channel discrimination @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , intriguing to see how or whether be can appear in quantum many - body systems .",
    "recently , it has been shown that a thermal environment can naturally induce the thermal transition from fe to be in quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "additionally , in a simple @xmath0 spin chain , varying the magnetic field can generate bound entangled gss @xcite . in a recent experiment @xcite ,",
    "an optical four - qubit state with be has been realized and then characterized fully .",
    "there is vast literature on qpts induced by a transition from separability to fe or a transition in the fe region ( in the sense of bipartite reduced density matrices of the gss ) . in this work , in contrast",
    ", we are interested in qpts in which the transition happens because of a change in the type of entanglement , specifically , from fe to be ( or conversely ) , or from separability to be ( or conversely ) .",
    "this is particularly interesting , because one of the vastly used measures of bipartite entanglement in the context of qpts , negativity @xcite , is inherently unable of detecting be , hence it would fail to signal a corresponding criticality .",
    "there are , however , some other computable ( but not necessarily conclusive ) inseparability tests for recognizing be , based on the cross norm @xcite and permutation @xcite criteria . in the case of quantum spin chains , a complete set of spin squeezing inequalities has also been introduced which can be used for experimentally detecting be of many - body thermal states @xcite .",
    "more appealing and arguably a stronger identifier than entanglement measures for detecting qpts is provided by the ground - state fidelity ( gsf ) @xcite or its second derivative @xcite , fidelity susceptibility ( fs ) .",
    "gsf and fs have been successfully used in the context of qpts in correlated quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "we address the types of qpts we are interested in through a reverse - construction method . given a many - body density matrix @xmath1 , we construct a spin - one chain hamiltonian @xmath2 whose gs has @xmath1 as the reduced density matrix of specific adjacent sites .",
    "thereby , by tuning the hamiltonian parameters in some suitable intervals , we will have gss representing qpts accompanied by the transition of their entanglement type from be to fe or separability .",
    "the technique is in principle relatively general and is illustrated by three examples .",
    "we should remark that we are not aiming to construct physically realizable hamiltonians .",
    "thus , here we are not concerned with the possible appearance of many - body ( three - body or higher order ) interactions in the constructed hamiltonians .",
    "this , although might seem to restrict the realistic applicability of the approach , is not a fundamental issue .",
    "there exists a powerful perturbative (  gadget \" ) machinery to construct arbitrary @xmath3-body ( effective ) interactions from two - body hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "consider a closed chain of @xmath4 identical quantum systems , e.g. , spins , each of which has a @xmath5-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "let us assume that we are given a global state @xmath6 whose two - site reduced density matrices ( tsrdms ) have some preset properties .",
    "for example , for odd @xmath7 , @xmath8 $ ] must be compatible with an already given @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( we denote the tsrdms for even @xmath7 by @xmath11 ) . for simplicity , let us suppose that there is a symmetry by which all @xmath9 ( @xmath12 ) are the same for all odd ( even ) @xmath7 .",
    "that is , the matrix form of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) can be considered as a representative of all @xmath9 ( @xmath12 ) with odd ( even ) @xmath7 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath15 where @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "that is , eqs .",

    "we follow similar steps as in ref .  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves only to positive semidefinite hamiltonians .",
    "thus , for any arbitrary @xmath6 , we have @xmath23 , so that if for a @xmath6 , @xmath24 this is an eigenvector of @xmath2 with zero eigenvalue , namely , the gs of the hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , we are interested in nearest - neighbor two - body ( or at most three - body ) interactions .",
    "that is , the sought - after @xmath2 has the following general form : @xmath25 it then can be shown that @xmath26 + \\sum_{i~\\text{even } } \\mathrm{tr}[h'_{i , i+1 } \\varrho'_{i , i+1}].\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{php}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , if for odd ( even ) @xmath7 we construct their corresponding @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) from the null eigenvectors ( or any combination or subset of the vectors in the null eigenspaces ) @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , as @xmath31}_{\\jmath } |w_{\\jmath}\\rangle_{i , i+1 } \\langle w_{\\jmath}| \\label{hii1-f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( and similarly for @xmath28 ) , where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34}_{\\jmath}$ ] ( @xmath35}_{\\jmath}$ ] ) are arbitrary nonnegative numbers , then all the terms in the summations of eq .",
    "( [ php ] ) would vanish .",
    "this of course is a sufficient condition , not always necessary .",
    "overall , with this choice for @xmath2 , we have @xmath36 , implying that @xmath6 is a gs .    put briefly , then , the construction boils down to finding the null eigenspaces of @xmath13 and @xmath37 .",
    "as long as , for the given @xmath6 , the nullities of these density matrices are nonzero , one can find a nearest - neighbor two - body hamiltonian describing the interactions on the chain .",
    "otherwise , the above recipe fails to provide coupling between all the neighboring particles on the chain .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily imply nonexistence of other compatible two - body hamiltonians . to remedy the issue with our construction ,",
    "given that @xmath6 is still the state with the desired properties , a possible way is to consider higher order interactions , e.g. , three body couplings .",
    "we should consider @xmath38 , or in general @xmath39 ( for some @xmath40 ) , rather than @xmath9 ( for odd @xmath7 ) . now",
    "if we repeat the hamiltonian construction recipe , we end up with @xmath40-local hamiltonians @xmath41 obtained from the null eigenspace of @xmath39 .",
    "thus , for example , the following hamiltonian @xmath42 where @xmath7 could be odd or even , provides a many - body interaction for which @xmath6 is a gs .    as a general example for the hamiltonian construction ,",
    "let us consider the following global state : @xmath43 this specific form implies that except for @xmath9 , for odd @xmath7 , the reduced density matrices of all other pairs of sites are separable @xcite .",
    "the proof is straightforward , e.g. , by using the schmidt decomposition for the bipartite states @xmath44}_{\\ell } } |\\ell^{[\\imath]}\\rangle_i |\\ell^{[\\imath]}\\rangle_{i+1}$ ] , for odd @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the state @xmath13 fully captures the pairwise ( i.e , two - site ) entanglement property of the whole chain .",
    "for example , if @xmath13 is bound entangled , no two - site fe then can be distilled from @xmath6 . our examples in sec .",
    "[ exs ] are all of the type of eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) ; besides , they have zero - nullity @xmath14 , hence @xmath2 will be many bodied .",
    "a few remarks about the recipe for the construction of the hamiltonian are in order here .",
    "( i ) there could be many hamiltonians ( with a set of given requirements , such as symmetry , range of interactions , and so on ) for which a given @xmath6 is a gs .",
    "our construction provides only one class of such hamiltonians .",
    "( ii ) by construction , our recipe implies that underlying symmetries of the state @xmath1 would also carry over into the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "( iii ) note that @xmath6 is not necessarily the unique gs of the constructed @xmath2 .",
    "for example , each term @xmath45 ( for any @xmath17 ) is also a gs ( one can construct other combinations which are gs ) .",
    "thus , when @xmath1 is mixed ( i.e. , @xmath46 , which is a generic case ) , the gs is degenerate .",
    "this means that if we consider the system with the hamiltonian @xmath2 , at zero temperature the system can be everywhere in the ground eigenspace spanned by @xmath47 and other possible gss . since this degeneracy is symmetry - driven , we can circumvent it by perturbing the system with a small symmetry - breaking term , i.e. , @xmath48 , and then allowing @xmath49 @xcite . for our purposes here and for the sake of clarity , however , the working gs is assumed to be @xmath6 ( which , for example , can be considered to be singled out by some selection rule ) .",
    "( iv ) in most physically interesting cases , we have @xmath50 ( @xmath51-local hamiltonians ) .",
    "however , since our goal in this paper is just to provide a framework for be qpts , we will not be concerned with the possible appearance of many - body interactions in the hamiltonians .",
    "additionally , there exists a powerful perturbative gadget mechanism to construct arbitrary three - body hamiltonians from two - body interactions @xcite .",
    "( v ) often ( but not necessarily always ) , if the state @xmath1 ( or @xmath6 ) depends on some controllable parameter ( or a set of parameters ) , say , @xmath52 , so will the hamiltonian @xmath53 . in the following , after briefly introducing gsf as the main tool for analyzing qpts , we shall illustrate our construction through three different examples featuring be .",
    "entanglement is a rather universal means of studying qpts @xcite .",
    "the ground - state fidelity ( gsf ) @xcite has been shown to be a very powerful tool that is capable of identifying various types of qpts , usually independent of symmetries , system - dependent details , or the nature of underlying quantum correlations ; hence , it can be used as a suitable  order parameter . \" recalling that negativity , is defined as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 ( in a given basis ) is the partial transposition and @xmath56 $ ] is the trace norm @xcite . ] a widely used entanglement measure , fails to signal be , and that other measures which may signal be are usually inconclusive , gsf or its derivatives seem appropriate supplemental tools for our analysis .",
    "the rationale behind the notion of the gsf is that , at zero temperature , the gs describes the whole characteristics of a typical quantum system .",
    "hence , when a qpt occurs at some point @xmath57 , a sudden change between the behavior of the gs slightly before ( @xmath58 ) and after ( @xmath59 ) this critical point may take place , which in principle can be captured by the following fidelity : @xmath60 the second derivative of the gsf with respect to @xmath61 , calculated at @xmath62 , is called the fidelity susceptibility  hereafter denoted by @xmath63and _",
    "per se _ is a powerful measure for detecting qpts @xcite . for the state @xmath64 as in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , @xmath65 reads @xmath66 in which @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ( @xmath61 ) will be taken to be relatively large ( small ) .",
    "here we remark that the _ reduced _ fidelity ( susceptibility)denoting the similarity between the density matrix of a subsystem of the gs before and after the qpt point  can also be a good local order parameter for identifying symmetry - breaking  @xcite and topological  @xcite qpts .",
    "there are also other , relatively less universal measures ( than the gsf , but in some sense stronger than negativity or concurrence @xcite ) to recognize ( particularly ) be associated with the tsrdm of the gs , e.g. , the realignment measure ( shortly , realignment ) @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that if a bipartite density matrix @xmath1 is separable , then , for the trace norm of its realignment @xmath70 ( defined element - wise as @xmath71 ) , we should have @xmath72 .",
    "it has been shown that in some cases , even if @xmath73 , the positivity of @xmath74 can be a signature of be @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the nonpositivity of @xmath69 does not necessarily imply separability @xcite .",
    "realignment together with negativity have been shown to set a lower bound for another widely used entanglement measure , concurrence @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it has been proven that for an @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) bipartite quantum state @xmath1 , we have @xmath78 , where @xmath79}$ ] @xcite . moreover , realignment has been recently used in devising a scheme for directly measuring entanglement of arbitrary states @xcite .",
    "recently , a criterion more powerful than realignment for @xmath68-partite systems ( when @xmath68 is even ) has been proposed @xcite . based on this criterion , which provides a sufficient condition for the separability ,",
    "a sparable bipartite state @xmath1 is the one for which the relation @xmath80 is satisfied .",
    "here , @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the reduced density matrices associated with the subsystems of @xmath1 .",
    "since in the special examples we study in the next section @xmath83 and @xmath84 are equal up to the multiplicative factor @xmath85 , in the rest of the paper we make use of @xmath83 as our main entanglement measure .",
    "in the following , we choose three different bipartite bound entangled states , and construct their corresponding hamiltonians ( all spin - one chains ) as in sec .",
    "[ consth ] .",
    "our goal is to find qpts where , for some parameter regions , a transition from be to fe ( or vice versa ) or from be to separability ( or vice versa ) may occur .",
