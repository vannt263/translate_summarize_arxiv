    "however , the world of two qubits is represented by @xmath0 hermitian matrices and being 16 dimensional it is not readily visualized .",
    "it can , however , be visualized by introducing an appropriate equivalence relation .",
    "this idea has been used in @xcite to describe the separable and entangled states . here",
    "we show that the entanglement witnesses and the chsh bell inequalities can be incorporated in this descriptions as well .",

    "an effective notion of equivalence comes from allowing alice and bob to operate on their respective qubits @xmath9 we shall focus on the case @xmath10 where the operation is invertible but not trace preserving .",
    "the physical interpretation of this is that states which are accessible by local , reversible filtering are identified .",
    "it is known as slocc @xcite and is briefly reviewed in section [ slocc ] . since @xmath11 the slocc equivalence reduces the dimension by 12 . as a consequence",
    ", the slocc equivalence classes of unnormalized 2 qubits states can be visualized in 3 dimensions .",
    "as we shall see , the slocc equivalence classes of entanglement witnesses are represented by the cube , the states by the tetrahedron and the separable states by the octahedron of fig .",

    "the octahedron and tetrahedron have been identified as the slocc representation in @xcite . adding the cube as a representation of the slocc equivalence classes of entanglement witnesses ,",
    "shows that the natural duality relation between witnesses and separable states is preserved in the visualization of the slocc equivalence classes : the cube is the dual of the octahedron in the usual sense of duality of convex sets @xcite .",

    "the tetrahedron is , of course , its own dual .    since the work of the horodeckis , @xcite , fig .",

    "since this family has lower dimension , it can be visualized in 3 dimensions using a more restrictive notion of equivalence than slocc : alice and bob are allowed to perform only unitary operations on their respective qubits with @xmath13 in eq .",

    "this in arguably the most fundamental notion of equivalence in quantum information theory and is known as locc @xcite .",

    "it is remarkable that both the visualization and the interpretation of fig .",
    "[ states3d ] remains the same when one goes from the 9 dimensional family to the 16 dimensional family of general 2 qubits states .",

    "[ states3d ] turns out to play a significant role also in the theory of quantum communication .",
    "namely , it characterizes the stochastic properties of certain _ single qubit _ quantum channels as shown in @xcite .",
    "this rather different interpretation of the figure follows from a deep relation , known as the choi - jamiolkwosky isomorphism @xcite , between linear operators acting on the hilbert space of alice and bob , and linear maps on single qubit states . using this , one finds , @xcite that ( for unital and trace preserving channels ) , the octahedron represents channels that destroy entanglement , the tetrahedron represents the completely positive maps and the cube the positive maps .",

    "[ states3d ] from a perspective that focuses on the duality relations between the sets in the figure .",

    "the local mapping of a two qubit state @xmath15 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : equivalence - states ] ) preserves positivity and takes a product state @xmath16 to a product state .",
    "it therefore maps any separable state  a convex combination of product states  to a separable state .",
    "this makes the equivalence @xmath17 , a useful notion in studying the entanglement of two qubits @xcite . since the operation does not preserve the normalization of the state it is convenient to consider states up to normalization .",
    "the operations performed by alice and bob can be interpreted as _ probabilistically reversible filtering _ associated with the povm e_1^(m)= , e_2^(m)=1-e_1^(m ) ( @xmath18 is not a local operator .",

    "the probability of successfully filtering the state @xmath20 is strictly positive and is given by @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath22 is unitary the filtering succeeds with probability one and no state is lost .",
    "the filtering is probabilistically reversible since the original state @xmath15 can be recovered , with non - zero probability , from @xmath23 using the filter @xmath24 .",
    "one can broaden the notion of equivalence under slocc from states to observable and in particular , to witnesses @xmath1 .",
    "we take the action on witnesses to be contragradient to that of states : @xmath25 ( in case @xmath22 is unitary states and observables transform the same way ) . the motivation for",
    "this choice is to have @xmath26 transforms by a similarity transformation so its trace and therefore the associated expectation and probability , is left invariant .",
    "we shall say that @xmath27 is a _ potential entanglement witness _ if @xmath28 for all separable states @xmath29 .",
    "since the set of separable states @xmath30 is a convex cone in the space of @xmath0 matrices , the set of potential entanglement witnesses @xmath31 is the dual convex cone of @xmath30 .",
    "the set of states , @xmath32 , is a convex cone as well , and the three convex cones are evidently nested @xmath33 the cones @xmath32 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 all lie in 16 dimensions , which is not very useful for visualization .",
    "slocc takes a potential entanglement witness to a potential entanglement witness .",
    "this follows from @xmath34 which shows that @xmath35 is an entanglement witness if @xmath27 is .",
    "slocc allows one to reduce the study of states , separable states , and ( potential ) entanglement witnesses to the study of the corresponding equivalence classes .",
    "as will be explained in section [ cto ] , the equivalence classes of the three cones are described by the three polyhedra shown in fig .",
    "[ states3d ] .",
    "similar ideas can be used to visualize bell inequalities as we now proceed to show .",
    "every bell inequality has a corresponding witness @xcite .",
    "let @xmath36 be a witness for a specific bell inequality .",
    "a state @xmath37 satisfies this bell inequality if @xmath38 since the separable states satisfy all types of bell inequalities @xcite it is clear that @xmath36 belongs to the family of potential entanglement witnesses .",
    "the set @xmath39 of states satisfying ( [ bell ] ) for a specific type of bell inequalities ( e.g. the chsh family ) forms a convex cone .",
    "however in general it is larger then the cone @xmath30 of separable states .",
    "the chsh bell inequalities describe a situation where alice may choose to measure her qubits in one of two directions , @xmath40 and bob may similarly choose one of the directions , @xmath41 .",
    "it is represented by the witness @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the chsh operator @xcite : @xmath44 @xmath45 .",
    "the chsh bell inequality then takes the form of eq .",
    "( [ bell ] ) .",
    "the family of all chsh witnesses is an a - priory 8 dimensional family associated with the 4 directions alice and bob choose .",
    "( in fact , an implicit degeneracy in eq .",
    "( [ bchsh ] ) makes it is only 7 dimensional . )",
    "locc takes a chsh witness corresponding to the directions @xmath46 to a witness associated with rotated directions while keeping @xmath47 and @xmath48 fixed .",
    "this reduces the dimension by 6 and allows us to visualize the equivalence classes of chsh witnesses . as we explain in section [ sec : vis - bell ] , they turn out to be the three circles shown in fig .",
    "[ bell_picture ] .",
    "local operations , eq .  ( [ eq : equivalence - states ] ) , are guaranteed to take separable states to separable states .",
    "this reflects the fact that no entangled state can ever be ( locally ) filtered from a separable state .",
    "this is not the case for states that satisfy bell inequalities .",
    "in fact , @xcite gave examples of states satisfying all the chsh inequalities whose filtration violate the inequality .",
    "this is consistent because the positivity of @xmath49 _ does not _ imply positivity of @xmath50 .",
    "slocc does not act nicely on chsh .",
    "this can also be seen from the fact that the family of chsh witnesses _ is not _",
    "mapped on itself by slocc .",
    "it is therefore _ not possible _ to represent the states that satisfy chsh inequalities in terms of their slocc equivalence classes .",
    "it seems clear however that if a state @xmath23 , filtered from @xmath15 ( using only local operations ) , breaks a certain bell inequality then the properties of @xmath15 itself are inconsistent with ( more general ) local hidden variables .",
    "indeed if @xmath15 would have been describable in terms of hidden variables that would have implied that the results of any experiment done on it including one involving local filtration ( which is also a type of measurement ) should be explainable in terms of these hidden variables consisting of filtration plus subsequent spin measurement can be described using hidden variables only if the choice of alice whether to measure @xmath51 or @xmath52 can influence the result of the filtration which was completed prior to it .",
    "this breaks natural causality assumptions .",
    "the fact that @xmath15 does not itself break bell s inequality may then be traced to the fact that the standard derivation of bell s inequalities does not involve these causality assumptions . ] .",
    "this motivates the introduction of a notion of states that satisfy bell inequality in a slocc sense by requiring not only the state @xmath37 satisfy the bell inequality @xmath36 , but also that all states that can be _ probabilistically filtered _ from @xmath37 do .",
    "this is clearly a slocc invariant notion .",
    "mathematically , it is expressed by the requirement @xmath53 we shall denote this set @xmath54 .",
    "it is , of course , a smaller set , @xmath55 , but it is not empty .",
    "this set is slocc invariant and so visualized in three dimensions .",
    "the corresponding 3-dimensional set is the intersection of @xmath56 cylinders shown in fig .",
    "[ bell3d ] , as we shall explain in section [ sec : vis - bell ] .",
    "for any fixed witness @xmath36 the equivalence class @xmath54 is a convex cone since _",
    "m tr ( w_b ( _ 1+_2)^m ) _ m tr ( w_b _ 1^m)+ _ m tr ( w_b _ 2^m ) since the intersection of convex cones is a convex cone , it follows that the states that satisfy _ a family _ of bell inequalities in the slocc sense also form a convex cone .",
    "in particular , this is so for the chsh family .",
    "the intersection of the cone with the hyperplane @xmath57 is then evidently a convex set .",
    "similarly , the dual ( convex ) cone to @xmath54 is slocc invariant by eq .",
    "( [ covariance ] ) , i.e. if @xmath36 is a witness for a given slocc family , so is @xmath58 .",
    "these notions of witnesses and states conform to the notion of slocc .",
    "they can therefore be represented in terms of their equivalence classes and can be visualized in three dimensions .",
    "to describe the slocc equivalence classes of qubits it is convenient to use their lorentz description .",
    "any single qubit observable @xmath59 can be written as @xmath60 the observable @xmath59 is then represented by the real 4-vector @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath59 is positive , and so is a state , if its trace and determinant are positive . since @xmath62 and @xmath63 ,",
    "states are described by 4-vectors @xmath61 that lie in the forward light - cone .",
    "consider @xmath64 since @xmath65 , it follows that the action of @xmath66 on the observable @xmath59 can be implemented by an ( orthochronous ) lorentz transformation of the four vector @xmath61 .",
    "namely , @xcite , @xmath67 similarly , any observable @xmath1 in the world of 2 qubits can be represented by by a @xmath0 real matrix @xmath2 as in eq .",
    "( [ observable ] ) .",
    "this representation allows a simple geometric characterization of potential entanglement witnesses in terms of matrices @xmath2 that map the forward light - cone into itself .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath1 is an entanglement witness iff for any product state , represented by time - like vectors @xmath68 : @xmath69 this characterization of potential witnesses will play a role in what follows .    to describe the slocc equivalence classes we shall consider invariants under the action ( [ eq : equivalence - states ] ) .",
    "the pair @xmath10 associated with @xmath70 gives rise to a pair of lorentz transformations @xmath71 and @xmath72 such that @xcite : @xmath73 since @xmath74 , @xmath75 is an invariant .",

    "this follows easily from the defining relations of the lorentz transformation @xmath79 : @xmath80 it follows that @xmath81 undergoes a similarity transformation under the action of @xmath22 , so its spectrum is a slocc invariant .    for a general observable ,",
    "@xmath82 is not guaranteed to be a hermitian matrix , and its spectrum therefore may not be real . however",

    "the lorentz orthogonal subspace to this eigenvector is a space - like invariant subspace .",
    "restricted to this subspace , the minkowsky adjoint coincides with the ordinary adjoint .",
    "this makes the remaining eigenvalues positive as well by @xmath83 above then it might happen that the largest eigenvalue has an eigenvector which is light - like .",
