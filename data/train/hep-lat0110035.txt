    "the formulation of gauge theories on the lattice does not require gauge fixing .",
    "however , to study green s functions of the fundamental fields , it is unavoidable to pick a gauge .",
    "moreover , the correlation functions of the fundamental fields can be used to compute renormalization constants or non - perturbative coefficients used in numerical simulations . for a general overview on gauge fixing in lattice gauge theories and related issues",
    "see @xcite .    on the lattice",
    ", gauge fixing can be viewed as an optimisation problem .",
    "typically , we have a maximising function with many local maxima , the gribov copies , and we want to identify its global maximum .",
    "the global maximum is not always unique defined . from the numerical point of view , global optimisation is not a trivial task , and among the various techniques genetic algorithms ( ga ) @xcite seems to be a good global searching method .",
    "genetic algorithms require an evolutive population and assume a number of rules for reproduction .",
    "the tuning of basic parameters , the probabilities of the genetic operators and the size of the evolutive population , is crucial to have good performance .",
    "the size of the population is an important parameter and can easily drive the method to use as much memory as available .",
    "our investigation started using pure ga to su(3 ) and su(2 ) landau gauge fixing on @xmath0 and @xmath1 lattices .",
    "we conclude that the method was unable to identify conveniently the global maximum .",
    "this negative result is due to the large number of variables involved and to the structure of the optimisation function .",
    "fortunately , a combination of ga with steepest descent method ( sd ) @xcite seems to be able to converge to the global maximum .    [ 0.3 ] su(3 ) configuration obtained after 1000 sd starting at randomly chosen different points.,title=\"fig : \" ]",

    "[ 0.3 ] as function of @xmath3 for a random su(2 ) configuration.,title=\"fig : \" ]    our implementation of the combined ga and sd algorithm uses the genetic operators ( after reunitarisation ) : @xmath4 random crossover , @xmath5 random blending , and the mutation operators @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is a random number and @xmath9 is a random su(n ) matrix .    as fitness function",

    "the code starts by generating an uniformly distributed initial population 2.5 times larger than the evolutive population .",
    "the first generation is chosen from this initial population .",
    "the mating selection for reproduction , and the choice of the first evolutive generation , uses roulette wheel sampling favouring the best members of the population .    on the final generation",
    "we apply sd requiring @xmath12 to all members of the population .",

    "the combined algorithm was tested with su(2 ) @xmath0 random configurations , and @xmath1 ( @xmath14 ) su(3 ) configurations generated with version 6 of the milc code @xcite .",
    "all runs report results after 400 ga generations .",
    "concerning cpu time we are not yet in the position on giving numbers .",
    "this is because we performed a large number of convergence tests at intermediate generations .",
    "final results , including more details about the method and cpu time information will be reported elsewhere soon .    for 3 of the su(3 ) configurations and for the su(2 ) configurations , the global maximum was computed by performing a large number ( 1000 ) of sd starting from randomly chosen different points . in our case , this should not be a problem since we are working with relatively small lattices .",
    "if we compare the results of the combined algorithm with random search , we have never observed maxima larger than that obtained by random search .",
    "configurations show a large number of local maxima - see figure [ maxima ] . for the combined algorithm ,",
    "the convergence of the best member of the population to the global maxima of @xmath15 depends on the size of the evolutive population ( @xmath3 ) and on @xmath11 .",
    "although one can arrive at the proper answer with quite small evolutive populations , the number of single steepest descent iterations defining the fitness function ( cpu time ) increases as the size of the population decreases . in figures [ npopnstepssu2 ] and [ npopnstepssu3 ]",
    "one can see the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath11 for su(2 ) and su(3 ) configurations .",
    "results are encouraging but further studies of how the algorithm scales with volume and @xmath16 should be done .",
    "the tests were performed using a serial version of the code .",
    "a parallel implementation of the algorithm is about to start testing .    to address the problem of gribov copies we look at the simplest correlation function which can be computed , namely the gluon propagator . in order to compute the propagator , 22 over - relaxed / quasi heat bath su(3 ) configurations where generated and the correlation function from sd compared to the correlation function from the combined ga / sd algorithm .",
    "results are given in figure [ propagador ] .",
    "the two methods show essentially the same behaviour .",
    "however , due to the large number of maxima in some configurations , a careful analysis should be done before drawing conclusions .",
    "furthermore , if an analysis of the gluon propagator certainly must be done , investigations of the quark and ghost propagators should not be forgotten .",
