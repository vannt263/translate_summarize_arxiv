    "the _ kepler _ mission was launched in march 2009 with a mission to find earth - size planets in the circumstellar `` habitable zone '' ( hz ) of solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "broadly speaking , the hz is considered the range of orbital semimajor axes over which the surface temperature on an earth - like planet would permit liquid water .",
    "a narrower definition , adopted here , is that it is the range of stellar irradiance between the runaway `` wet '' greenhouse limit - beyond which a water - vapor saturated n@xmath3-co@xmath3 atmosphere can not radiate , and the co@xmath3 `` snowball '' limit below which this greenhouse gas condenses from an earth - like atmosphere onto the poles @xcite .",
    "this definition makes assumptions about planetary albedo , rotation rate @xcite , orbital eccentricity and obliquity @xcite , extent of oceans @xcite , and thickness and composition of the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "many other factors besides stellar irradiation determine habitability @xcite .",
    "a planet in the canonical hz may not be earth - like , e.g. , if it is geologically inactive @xcite , and there may be habitable environments outside the hz , e.g. in the interiors of icy satellites @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an orbit in this hz is a useful criterion for selecting objects for follow - up observations .",
    "such prioritization is essential given that there are thousands of faint ( @xmath415th magnitude ) _ kepler _ systems that would require impractical amounts of telescope time to study .",
    "@xcite published a catalog of 54 ( out of 1235 ) candidate planets or _",
    "kepler _ objects of interest ( kois ) with equilibrium emitting temperatures between 273 and 373  k , assuming an earth - like albedo of 0.3 .",
    "@xcite noted the importance of albedo , specifically cloud cover , to equilibrium temperature , and computed inner and outer hz boundaries based on the stellar irradiation criteria derived by @xcite for high h@xmath3o and high co@xmath3 atmospheres , respectively .",
    "they identified 76 possible habitable planets , depending on the assumed fractional cloud cover .",
    "they found that many of the @xcite candidates were too hot for this habitability criterion and pointed out that errors in stellar parameters contribute most to the uncertainty of whether a planet orbits within the hz .",
    "subsequently , a larger catalog ( 2300 kois , including some that are confirmed planets ) , was released @xcite .",
    "stellar parameters for koi hosts , i.e. mass @xmath5 and radius @xmath6 , were determined by fitting yale - yonsei model isochrones @xcite to values of effective temperature ( @xmath7 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath8 ) , and metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "stellar parameters were derived from the photometry of the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic ) and a model of stellar populations and galactic structure @xcite .",
    "the @xcite estimates of mass and radii assumed gaussian - distributed errors and employed standard deviations derived from a comparison between kic - derived parameters and spectroscopic values .",
    "they revised the @xcite estimates of @xmath8 and @xmath6 for many stars .",
    "@xcite assumed an albedo of 0.3 and efficient redistribution of heat over a planet s surface , and identified 46 candidates with 185  k @xmath9 303  k.    however , the @xcite stellar parameters themselves are uncertain and in some aspects problematic .",
    "the vast majority of _ kepler _ stars do not yet have measured parallaxes .",
    "kic photometry must be corrected to place it in the sloan system , and kic - based effective temperatures are about 200  k hotter than estimates based on the infrared flux method @xcite .",
    "moreover , uncertainties in stellar parameters , and hence incident irradiance , can be markedly non - gaussian .",
    "this is particularly true for solar - type stars for which photometry is unable to distinguish between main sequence and evolved ( subgiant ) stars @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "standard deviations have limited utility in assessing statistical confidence .",
    "a more rigorous approach is to estimate a _",
    "probability _ that a planet orbits in the hz , i.e. that the irradiance falls between the wet runaway greenhouse and co@xmath3 condensation limits .",
    "this can be done using the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of irradiance calculated from pdfs of the stellar parameters .",
    "the latter can be generated by comparing stellar models to observational constraints ( i.e. photometry ) , calculating probabilities that the models can explain the data , and conditioning these by bayesian priors .",
    "each model and its associated value for irradiance is assigned a posterior probability , and the probability that the planet orbits in the hz is the sum of the probabilities for those models having irradiances within the hz limits , divided by the total probability for all models .",
    "bayesian estimation of stellar parameters has been applied to the kic @xcite as well as _ hipparcos _",
    "stars @xcite .",
    "the analysis described here is distinguished by the use of corrected kic photometry , synthetic isochrones and photometry from the dartmouth stellar evolution database @xcite ( see also @xcite , and new priors that describe distributions with mass ( imf ) , metallicity , age , and distance using recent models of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "in addition , it uses the duration and probability of planet transits to constrain stellar density @xcite .",
    "i applied this procedure to the catalog of 2740 confirmed and candidate planets around 2036 _ kepler _ stars released on 7 january 2013 .",
    "i estimated the expected fraction of stars with planets orbiting in the hz , and identified ( candidate ) planets with a better - than - even chance of having such orbits .",
    "i also cataloged earth- to super earth - size planets with lower but non - zero probabilities .",
    "these objects are high - priority targets for follow - up observations to confirm the planets and better characterize their host stars .",
    "i compared photometry for each star with sets of synthetic sdss+2mass _ grizjhk@xmath10 _ photometry from the isochrones of the dartmouth stellar evolution program ( dsep ) @xcite . with appropriate choices of mixing length and initial helium and heavy element fractions ,",
    "dsep is able to accurately reproduce the radius , luminosity , and convective boundary of the sun , as well as the radii of fully convective stars in the hierarchical triple system koi-126 @xcite .",
    "dsep uses phoenix model stellar atmospheres as boundary conditions ; these lte atmosphere models compare favorably to non - lte calculations and observations for stars cooler than 7000  k @xcite .",
    "i compared up to six colors constructed with respect to the @xmath11 magnitude . according to bayes theorem , the probability @xmath12 that the @xmath13th model ( hypothesis ) is supported by the photometry is equal to the probability that the colors @xmath14 can be produced by the model , multipled by a prior function @xmath15 .",
    "assuming gaussian - distributed errors in photometry , that probability is @xmath16,\\ ] ] where the summation is over up to six colors , @xmath17 are the synthetic colors , @xmath18 are the photometric errors , @xmath19 is the interstellar reddening coefficient for the color , and @xmath20 is the amount of reddening that is assigned to a particular model and star ( see below ) .",
    "the normalization in eqn .",
    "[ eqn.prob ] is unimportant as it independent of the models and i identified the model which has the largest value of @xmath21 .",
    "the prior is the product of individual priors for the mass , age , distance , and metallicity of the model , the intervening extinction , and , since at least one planet has been detected around each of these stars , a constraint on stellar density imposed by the duration of the transit @xcite .",
    "photometry and other data for the host stars of the kois were extracted from the kic catalog available at the mast database .",
    "kic _ griz _",
    "magnitudes were transformed to the sloan system using the corrections determined by @xcite .",
    "standard errors for each bandpass were estimated using the expression @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , for _ grizjhk _ , respectively @xcite . for _ griz",
    "_ the magnitude @xmath25 is the _ kepler _ magnitude @xmath26 and for _ jhk@xmath10 _ it is the respective 2mass magnitudes .",
    "errors in color were calculated by assuming that errors in individual bandpasses are uncorrelated and adding the two corresponding such errors in quadrature .",
    "minimization of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath27 leads to a formula for the best - fit reddening for each model : @xmath28 i adopted extinction coefficients @xmath29 of 3.758 ( @xmath30 ) , 2.565 ( @xmath11 ) , 1.874 ( @xmath13 ) , 1.377 ( @xmath31 ) , 0.272 ( @xmath32 ) , 0.173 ( @xmath33 ) , and ( @xmath34 ) , based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "i used the dsep interpolator tool to construct a grid of isochrones with [ fe / h ] @xmath35 $ ] , at intervals of 0.1 dex , @xmath36 @xmath37 $ ] , at intervals of 0.2 dex , and ages @xmath38 $ ]  gyr at intervals of 0.5  gyr . all models used a helium fraction @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the total heavy element abundance .",
    "i further restricted the selection to stars with initial masses between 0.1 and 2 solar masses , as late m and o , b , and early a - type stars are absent from the _ kepler _ target list @xcite .",
    "this restriction reduced the total number of models considered to 657,347 .",
    "once the best - fit model with the maximum @xmath21 was found , additional models ( typically a few dozen ) with neighboring ( difference less than 1.5 times the grid spacing ) values of mass , age , [ fe / h ] , and [ @xmath41/fe ] were identified .",
    "a set of 100 linear interpolations between the best - fit model and each of these neighboring models was made and new probablities calculated using eqn .",
    "[ eqn.prob ] .",
    "the interpolation yielding the highest value of @xmath21 was recorded .",
    "priors weight each dsep model , i.e. each combination of initial mass , metallicity , age , and distance ( modulus ) .",
    "the distance modulus for each star / model combination was computed in the @xmath11-band , i.e. @xmath42 . a uniform prior is adopted for for the allowed range of [ @xmath41/fe ] between -0.2 and + 0.4 dex . as a prior for initial stellar masses",
    "i adopt the tripartate initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite .",
    "priors for age , metallicity , and distance modulus @xmath43 were constructed using the distributions of dwarf stars ( @xmath44 ) with @xmath45 synthesized using trilegal @xcite .",
    "trilegal accurately reproduces star counts over a wide range of magnitudes to very low galactic latitudes @xcite .",
    "the simulated population was restricted to dwarfs to reflect the criteria of the selection of _ kepler _ targets @xcite .",
    "the ( mostly default ) values for key trilegal parameters are the same as used in @xcite .",
    "the resulting prior distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig.priors ] ) have a median metallicity of -0.13 , median age of 3.9  gyr , and median @xmath46 ( @xmath41740  pc ) .",
    "the age distribution is complex because the population includes halo stars , which formed 11 - 12  gyr ago , and disk stars , which started forming 9  gyr ago in these simulations .",
    "trilegal models the star formation rate in the disk in two steps , with the second occurring at about the epoch of the sun s formation .",
    "the paucity of stars younger than 1  gyr is partly due to the fact that the _ kepler _ field probes the stellar population that is @xmath47  pc above the galactic plane . of course , stellar ages , metallicities , and distances are interrelated , but here they are used separately , providing broad constraints on the possible ranges of stellar parameters .",
    "the distance distribution is particularly important in allowing the finite scale height of the galactic disk to prevent malmquist bias from selecting arbitrarily distant and luminous stars .",
    "the _ kepler _ field is @xmath410 degrees wide and close to the galactic plane ( @xmath48 deg ) , so the stellar populations that are probed will vary significantly across the field . using trilegal ,",
    "i synthesized the stellar population over a square degree centered at each of 84 _ kepler _ half - ccd fields .",
    "only those synthetic populations for ccd field centers with @xmath49 within 0.5 deg of a given _ kepler _ star ( about 10% of the total ) were used to calculate priors for age , metallicity , and distance .    a prior for extinction @xmath27",
    "necessarily involves information about the distribution of both stars and dust along each line of sight .",
    "however , by assuming that the spatial distributions of stars and dust are the same , the prior becomes particularly simple : a uniform distribution between 0 and total ( @xmath50 ) extinction along the line of sight ( see appendix a ) .",
    "i found improved agreement with spectroscopy ( section [ subsec.compare ] ) by conditioning @xmath27 with a uniform prior between 0 and @xmath51 $ ] , where @xmath31 is the vertical galactic distance above the sun based on @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the dust scale height ( @xmath4200  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "i adopted the @xcite galactic reddening maps and interpolated the total extinction at the coordinates of each star using the idl tools provided by the princeton website .",
    "models with optimal @xmath27 values outside this range are allowed , but reddening is limited to the maximum value and the models are penalized for the resulting disagrement between measured and model colors ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn.prob ] ) .",
    "the transit duration @xmath54 and orbital period @xmath55 of a transiting planet constrain stellar density @xcite and can be used as an additional prior for stellar models . in the case of _ kepler _ low - cadence data , the constraint is weakened by a lack of information about the orbit , specifically independent determination of the orbital eccentricity @xmath56 and the transit impact parameter @xmath49 .",
    "the transit duration @xmath57 is : @xmath58 where the stellar free - fall time is @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath61 is the argument of periastron relative to the line of sight to the star . given @xmath57 and @xmath55 and a value for @xmath54 for each stellar model , @xmath56 can be written as a function of @xmath49 and @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",

    "each value of @xmath56 was assigned a probability , i.e. values not @xmath66 $ ] were assigned zero and others were assigned probabilities from a prior distribution of @xmath56 . a rayleigh distribution ,",
    "@xmath67 was assumed , with @xmath68 .",
    "such a distribution has been used in a previous analysis of _ kepler _ transit durations @xcite and is motivated by dynamical theory @xcite .",
    "then the prior for the @xmath13th model from the duration of the transit is @xmath69 to account for finite errors in transit duration , the prior can be calculated using multiple monte carlo - generated values of @xmath57 is repeated and then averaged . in the case of a multi - planet system @xmath70 , the product of the individual transit duration priors @xmath71 was used .",

    "these functions account for two major factors that introduce a dependence of the hz boundaries on the stellar spectrum ( and hence effective temperature ) : the dependence of rayleigh scattering on wavelength , and the strong absorption by h@xmath3o at redder wavelengths .",
    "both act to lower the bond albedo of an earth - like planet around a cooler star relative to a hotter star @xcite .",
    "@xcite re - calculated the irradiance boundaries using a _ cloud - free _ climate model based on new h@xmath3o and co@xmath3 absorption coefficients .",
    "the revised boundaries are 10% lower ( further out ) than those of @xcite but this difference is much smaller than that between the cloud - free and cloudy cases of @xcite . because the _ kepler _ survey is heavily biased towards shorter periods @xcite and thus the high - irradiance ( inner ) edge of the hz is more important to the determination of @xmath0 , and because of the importance of clouds to this boundary , i elected to use the 50% cloud case of @xcite .",
    "i determine whether a planet is in the hz for each set of model stellar parameters @xmath79,@xmath80 , and @xmath81 with associated probability @xmath12 . the probability @xmath0 that the planet is in the hz is then : @xmath82 i consider candidate planets ( or planets that may have satellites ) as having greater - than - even odds of orbiting in the hz ( @xmath1 ) as well as having a most probable value of @xmath83 ( with highest @xmath21 ) satisfying @xmath84 .",
    "accurate estimates of stellar effective temperature @xmath7 and radius @xmath6 are crucial to assessing whether a planet is in the hz , as together these largely determine the luminosity of the host star and the irradiance experienced by the planet on a given orbit .",

    "there are four stars with significantly ( @xmath86 ) hotter photometric estimates of @xmath7 relative to spectroscopy ; only one of these is missing photometry .",
    "the reason(s ) for the discrepancy among the other stars are unclear .",
    "one possibility is that the photometric source is a blend resolved by spectroscopy , or that the transit signal itself may be coming from a component of a blend which is dissimilar to the source of most of the light , and consequently the transit duration prior is skewing the stellar parameters . after removing the 208  k offset and ignoring stars with missing colors , the standard deviation between photometric and spectroscopic values of @xmath7 is @xmath87  k for solar - type stars and 130  k for m dwarfs",
    "this equals the performance of the analysis of @xcite , but without the benefit of parallaxes .",

    "this manuever assumes that the planet population inside 85  d is the same as that inside 245  d , but a distribution with radius would have to be assumed regardless because of severe incompleteness for small planets on wider orbits .",

    "the probability distributions with @xmath118 ( eqn . [ eqn.hzprob ] ) were computed for each realization and summed .",
    "the summed distribution peaks at 0.332 with 95% confidence limits of 0.22 and 0.49 . based on the distribution in @xcite ,",
    "the fraction of stars with a planet larger than 0.8r@xmath104 in the hz is @xmath147 ( 95% confidence interval of 0.46 - 0.81 ) .",
    "_ assumptions and systematic errors : _ there are several approximations and potential sources of systematic error that could affect the values of @xmath0 calculated here ; i expect these values to evolve and that a few candidate planets may move in or out of the catalog as new data are incorporated , and the dsep models are revised .",
    "however , the close correspondence between this catalog and previous ones suggests that the selection is relatively robust , although the relative rankings may change .",
    "the constraint from the transit duration depends on orbital eccentricity , argument of periastron , and impact parameter .",
    "uniform priors are appropriate choices for the last two parameters . however ,",
    "a rayleigh distribution for eccentricities ( eqn . [ eqn.eccentricity ] ) with mean @xmath148 , while consistent with _",
    "data @xcite , is neither tightly constrained nor a unique choice ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed ,",
    "a more refined prior would include the interrelationships with planet mass , orbital period , and the age of the system @xcite .",
    "i calculated the difference in @xmath0 resulting from changing @xmath73 from 0.1 to 0.3 .",
    "for the 62 candidates in the hz , one half of the mean difference between the @xmath0 values is 0.019 .",
    "this indicates that the transit duration constraint has a small but non - negligible effect on the identification of hz planets .",
    "these priors do not include the probability that a planet will transit its host star and be detected by _ kepler _ , and thus be included in the koi catalog .",
    "such selection effects can be important in catalogs of transiting planets and their host stars @xcite .",
    "the geometric transit probability @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the semimajor axis , is proportional to @xmath151 and could be included readily enough : this factor will favor stellar models with larger radii .",
    "however , the probability of transit detection is primarily related to transit depth @xmath152 and for a given @xmath153 , a prior on stellar radius is ultimately a prior on _ planet _ radius .",
    "some of these kois are nearly earth - size , where the completeness of the _ kepler _ survey is still being refined .",
    "other kois are at or near theoretical limits of giant planet radii and any prior on stellar radii would have to include scenarios for astrophysical false positives .",
    "there are additional , but perhaps minor complexities : the probability of a transit occurring and being detected will also depend on @xmath56 , @xmath61 , @xmath49 , as well as @xmath57 , the transit duration .",
    "for these reasons , i do not include transit detection as a prior .",
    "equation [ eqn.reddening ] presumes a linear relationship between extinction in different bandpasses , i.e. that all can be linearly related to reddening @xmath27 .",
    "this is not strictly correct , but is a fair approximation in the limit of small reddening .",
    "the median derived @xmath27 for these stars is only 0.08 , corresponding to 0.25 magnitudes of extinction , and the 95 percentile value is 0.18 .",
    "if the scale height of dust is smaller than that of stars , then the uniform prior derived under the assumption of identical gas and dust distributions ( appendix a ) slightly underestimates the amount of reddening .",
    "because reddening and temperatures derived from photometry are correlated , this assumption slightly underestimates the temperature and luminosities of stars as well .",
    "the total number of candidate hz planets is not sensitive to the precise irradiation limits . because of detection bias towards short - period orbits ,",
    "there are very few detected planets beyond the hz ( fig .",
    "[ fig.hz1 ] ) . for an earth - like planet with 100%",
    "cloud cover , the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit is 23% higher than the 50% cloud - cover case @xcite , but this admits only one additional candidate to the catalog . on the other hand , hz calculations are sensitive to the precise value of @xmath7 because of the sensitivity of luminosity to effective temperature , and future refinements are worthwhile ( see below ) .",
    "i do not account for systematic errors in the dsep and trilegal models themselves , but given the agreement with spectroscopy ( fig .",
    "[ fig.compareteff ] ) these are likely to be comparatively small .",
    "of course , the hz described here only applies to earth - like planets with a surface pressure of @xmath154  bar .",
    "planets with different surface gravities , pressures , and/or compositions may be habitable to larger distances @xcite , or not at all @xcite .    _",
    "the trouble with m dwarfs : _ the fundamental parameters of m dwarf stars have been a notorious challenge for models because of the difficulty in reproducing the observed mass - radius relation and their complex spectra .",
    "the dsep models employed here accurately predict the radii of the two m dwarfs in the triply eclipsing hierarchical triple system koi-126 @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "dsep uses phoenix model atmospheres @xcite for both the stellar surface boundary conditions and to generate synthetic magnitudes .",
    "the spectroscopic temperatures presented here are calibrated using nearby interferometry targets @xcite using the bt - settl flavor of phoenix models @xcite , hence the good correlation between the two estimates is not surprising . nevertheless , the offset of 60  k in @xmath7 is represents a @xmath410% difference in @xmath155 .",
    "another obstacle is that accurate modeling of the lightcurves of planets transiting m dwarfs must correctly account for significant limb darkening in the _ kepler _ pass - band .",
    "erroneous transit durations , acting through the prior described in section [ sec.transit ] , can bias the analysis towards models with incorrect radii : a 10% error in @xmath6 leads to a @xmath430% error in @xmath155 .",
    "this is sufficient to `` move '' a planet completely outside the hz , or at least decrease the @xmath0 of a marginal hz planet to @xmath15650% .",
    "re - analyses of the _ kepler _ transit lightcurves with improved limb - darkening models and re - derivation of the parameters of m dwarf koi hosts are worthwhile , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "_ future observations of kepler stars : _ stellar parameters based on analysis of photometry are no substitute for values based on high - resolution spectra , as long as the latter are carefully calibrated ( see * ? ? ? * ) . however , the median magnitude of the host stars of these planet is @xmath157 , and high - resolution spectroscopy is observationally expensive .",
    "the object most amenable to followup is , not coincidentally , _ kepler_-22b ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the next brightest host star is that of koi  1989.01 ( @xmath159 ) and the rest are much fainter still and would require significant time on very large telescopes .",
    "however , this analysis generates a robustly - defined catalog to prioritize such work .",
    "the _ gaia _ ( originally global astrometric interferometer for astrophysics ) mission , scheduled for launch in october 2013 , will obtain parallaxes with a sky - averaged , end - of - mission precision of 25  @xmath160as and 40  @xmath160as for 15th and 16th magnitude stars , respectively , and somewhat superior performance at the ecliptic latitude ( @xmath466  deg . ) of the _ kepler _ field @xcite . to assess the potential of _ gaia _ to refine the habitable zones of _ kepler _ stars and the sizes of the planest that inhabit them , i re - calculated @xmath12 ( eqn .

    "the 95% confidence intervals in radius and stellar irradiance of the 62 hz candidates were re - calculated and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.gaia ] .",
    "the most probable values are unchanged , but the fractional errors in radius and irradiance are reduced by a factor of @xmath45 , from a median of 10% and 24% , respectively , to 1.7% and 5% , ( equating 95% confidence intervals to @xmath165 ) .",
    "the largest planets tend to orbit the hottest and most distant stars @xcite and their parameters would retain the largest errors in this scenario .",
    "typically , a few hundred dsep models have appreciable @xmath21 values and contribute to the calculation for each star , but in a few cases the number is a few dozen and finite model grid size may determine the size of the errors .",
    "values of @xmath0 for 50 of the 62 planets are @xmath166 .",
    "spectroscopic values of @xmath7 accurate to 100  k would offer only modest further improvement ( 1.5% and 4.5% errors , respectively ) . because these precisions reach or exceed levels of confidence in the predictions of the stellar models themselves as well as the absolute calibration of the photometry , refinement and verification of these",
    "may prove a more cost - efficient avenue for improvement .",
    "for example , _ ugri _ and h@xmath167 photometry of much of the _ kepler _ field has been obtained at the isaac newton telescope @xcite and _ ubv _ photometry has been obtained at wiyn @xcite .    with such precision , it should be possible to locate planets within different regions of the hz , e.g. near the inner edge , where low co@xmath3 atmospheres , and possibly high cloud fraction if there is a temperature - cloud feedback , should prevail : or the outer edge , where high co@xmath3 @xcite and possible water cloud - free atmospheres are more likely .",
    "candidate hz planets in multi - planet systems might be confirmed or even have masses determined by ttv .",
    "although such advances may be difficult for planets around faint _",
    "kepler _ stars , this analysis offers a preview of the potential return from surveys of nearby , more observationally accessible stars , e.g. by the proposed tess @xcite and cheops missions .",
    "my calculations suggest that @xmath464% of dwarf stars have planets orbiting in their habitable zones .",
    "the fraction of stars with earth - size ( @xmath168r@xmath104 ) planets in the hz ( @xmath2 ) is 0.46 ( 95% confidence limits of 0.31 - 0.64 ) .",
    "this statistic will be greatly refined as the _ kepler _ extended mission more thoroughly probes the hz of solar - type stars , detection completeness is better quantified for smaller planets ( fig .",
    "[ fig.hzfrac ] ) , and the luminosities of the stars are better established ( fig [ fig.gaia ] ) .",
    "this estimate is only marginally higher than that of @xcite ( @xmath2 = @xmath169 ) , who used the first 136 days of _ kepler _ data . also using _ kepler _ data",
    ", @xcite calculated that @xmath170 of m dwarfs have earth - size ( 0.5 - 1.4r@xmath104 ) planets in the hz , but this was revised upwards to @xmath171 by @xcite .",
    "based on a radial velocity survey , @xcite estimated that 0.41@xmath172 of m dwarfs have planets with 1m@xmath104@xmath17310m@xmath104 in the hz .",
    "the latter estimates are completely consistent with the value reported here for a wider range of spectral types , supporting optimism that numerous planets orbit in the habitable zones of stars all along the main sequence .",

    "<S> fourteen of these have radii less than twice the earth ; the objects most resembling earth in terms of radius and irradiance are kois 2626.01 and 3010.01 , which orbit late k / m - type dwarf stars . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of _ kepler _ dwarf stars with earth - size planets in the habitable zone ( @xmath2 ) is 0.46 , with a 95% confidence interval of 0.31 - 0.64 . </S>",
    "<S> parallaxes from the _ gaia _ mission will reduce uncertainties by more than a factor of five and permit definitive assignments of transiting planets to the habitable zones of _ kepler _ stars . </S>"
