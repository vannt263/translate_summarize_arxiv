    "the  observed from 1994 to 2002 a set of 171 quasars , bl lac objects , and radio galaxies , selected to be representative of the compact agn radio population ( see e.g. , @xcite ; images in @xcite and @xcite ; kinematical results of the parsec - scale jet features in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this sample was redefined to include 135 objects ( two thirds from those belonging to the  sample ) and to be statistically complete with continued monitoring observations from 2002 with the name of the -1 program ( see @xcite for a description of the images , and @xcite for kinematical results ) .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat , see @xcite ) on board the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ has detected a big fraction of the agn present in these samples .",
    "furthermore , @xcite has shown that the majority of the  blazars are radio - loud and show a core - jet structure at parsec scales    first results on the gamma - radio relationship were published for the statistically complete sample , in a first instance for the lat bright agn source ( lbas ) 3-month list ( see @xcite for the  results , and @xcite for the lbas ) .",
    "the results presented in this conference are based on a preliminary 11-month list of  detections as of early november 2009 , at the time of the fermi symposium 2009 .    from the  sample , 79 prominent agn",
    "are not members of the statistically complete sample ( -i ) , and their radio properties can be as well compared to the  findings ( 19 of those are detected at the preliminary 11-month list ) .",
    "kinematic values of the agn jets were obtained from the intensive monitoring survey being performed since 1994 . generally , the very long baseline array ( vlba ) observed each agn for a total time of 5060min in scans of several minutes spread over 8hr , providing an almost full interferometric track .",
    "each source was observed over several epochs during those years , with a time sampling of at least one observation per year .",
    "additional , high - quality vlba archival epochs were added to the data base .",
    "after ( semi - automatic ) imaging of the vlbi observations , the features observed in the jets were modeled by gaussian functions fitted to the interferometric visibilities .",
    "those features were identified over several epochs , and the measurement of their relative positions provided kinematical values from which further statistical studies can be performed , as well as individual source studies ( see @xcite for a description of the imaging process and @xcite and references therein for kinematic results of the -i sample , and @xcite for the kinematic analysis of the  sample . ) .",
    "here we compare these results with the  detections .        [",

    "figure [ fig : latdetections ] shows a chart counting the members of the  and the -i samples , divided by optical class , with fill colour for the sources detected at the preliminary 11-month  list and transparent colour for the non - detected one .",
    "those are shown numerically in table  [ table : lat - detrate ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : z - dist ] shows the distribution of redshifts and the differences between the statistically complete sample ( top ) and the sources from the  not belonging to this ( bottom ) . with a smaller number of sources , the fraction of moderate redshift qsos is larger for the sources not included in -i .",
    "again , the detection rate is very low for radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "figure  [ fig : betaapp - dist ] shows the distribution of the maximum jet speeds for both sets of sources .",
    "notice that the faster jets ( above @xmath1 ) belong favourably to sources detected by lat , and that in general all sources from the  not contained in  have slower jets . from those ,",
    "the high speed ones are not detected by lat . as it was preliminarly presented by @xcite and will be shown by @xcite , sources with faster jets tend to be favourably detected by lat .",
    "the gamma detection rate of the  sample is much higher than for the sources of the  not belonging to the complete sample .",
    "the latter sources have in general slower jets .",
    "notice that the -i sample is selected on the base of compact , beamed ( vlbi ) emission , and that the gamma - ray emission is correlated with compactness @xcite .",
    "the speeds for gamma - detected sources at the -1 sample are higher than for the non - detected ones , especially in the case of the qsos .",
    "notice that the faster the jets are , the more sources have been gamma - detected ( 9 out of 10 for @xmath2 ) .    a 70% of the quasars of the 2 cm survey not belonging to -i were not detected in gamma - rays , which shows a big difference in the parent population from the statistically complete sample and the additional sources .",
    "notice as well that the -1 sample was selected from active sources since the mid 1990s .",
    "sources which were active before and not at present would emit in gamma - rays less likely .",
    "the kinematic results from the sources belonging to the  and not belonging to the statistically complete sample , and a discussion on the  detections from the newer gamma - catalog to be released in a near future will be presented in @xcite . in a mid - term",
    ", the excellent results to be provided by , including gamma luminosities and varibility will be tested in the near future together with the radio properties , yielding unprecedented information about the nature of the agn phenomenon and the emission processes involved .    in the framework of the mojave collaboration we thank especially christian m.  fromm for support in the kinematic analysis and chin - shin chang for analysis from the  detection list .",
    "we thank the  collaboration for providing preliminary gamma - catalog data ( 11-month list ) for the production of this contribution .",
