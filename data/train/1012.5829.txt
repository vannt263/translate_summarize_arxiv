    "ongoing efforts to develop the nuclear energy density functional ( edf ) of spectroscopic quality are faced with the challenge to find optimal experimental and theoretical constraints that would help us pinning down its various coupling constants .",
    "traditional parameterizations of nuclear edfs such as skyrme and gogny often rely , through the fitting protocol applied , on a combination of carefully selected experimental data as well as pseudo data characterizing properties of nuclear matter ( see , e.g. , discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . considering the fairly simple forms ( and small number of coupling constants ) of commonly used nuclear edfs",
    ", the success of the nuclear density functional theory ( dft ) to describe a wide range of nuclear properties has been truly remarkable .",
    "however , the robustness of these parameterizations when going away from the neighborhood of the stability valley , where experimental data are abundant , to the neutron - rich region where data are scarce or non - existent , is questionable . indeed , large differences in predictions for very neutron - rich or super - heavy elements seen for various edfs @xcite is highly unsatisfactory .",
    "in fact , recent systematic studies of skyrme edfs showed that some coupling constants can not be properly constrained by existing data , and that the current forms of edfs are too limiting @xcite .",
    "moreover , early attempts to employ statistical methods of linear - regression and error analysis @xcite have been revived recently and applied to determine the uncertainties of edf parameters , errors of calculated observables , and to assess the quality of theoretical extrapolations @xcite .",
    "the major uncertainty in nuclear edf lies in the isovector channels that are poorly constrained by experiment ; hence , new data on unstable nuclei with large neutron excess having a large  lever arm \" from the valley of stability are essential @xcite .",
    "the pool of fit - observables entering the optimization protocol of edf , usually contains experimental data characterizing both bulk ( global ) and local nuclear properties , as well as theoretical pseudo - data pertaining to global nuclear matter properties ( nmp ) .",
    "the characterization in terms of  bulk \" and  local \" is not very precise and somehow arbitrary ; it has its origin in the macroscopic - microscopic approach , which offers a description in terms of a macroscopic liquid drop ( whose properties change smoothly as a function of nucleon numbers ) and shell correction that oscillates rapidly with shell filling @xcite . in the context of dft ,",
    "the binding energy of a nucleus of mass @xmath0 and neutron - excess @xmath1 can be split into a smooth function of @xmath2 and @xmath0 , and a fluctuating shell correction term by means of the strutinsky energy theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem , together with the shell - correction method , offers a formal framework to link the self - consistent dft with macroscopic - microscopic models which often provide useful insights in terms of the liquid drop ( or droplet ) model and shell effects .",
    "single - particle shell structure can be accessed through , e.g. , experimental separation energies and single - particle strength .",
    "such fit - observables are often used in the determination of edf parameterizations @xcite .",
    "similarly , the volume and symmetry terms of the liquid drop model ( ldm ) @xcite are related to nuclear matter properties , which are relatively well determined .",
    "this effectively constrains specific combinations of parameters of the edf . however , surface terms of the ldm are harder to pin down . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the leptodermous expansion of the nuclear binding energy was revisited , and the ldm parameters of several edfs were extracted from dft calculations for very large nuclei . while the surface and curvature terms came out to be fairly robust , it was found that the surface - symmetry coefficient @xmath3 of the ldm could vary by a factor 3 across the set of parameterizations .",
    "this coefficient enters the expression for the symmetry energy in the ldm : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ( volume ) symmetry energy coefficient .",
    "a thorough compilation of symmetry energy coefficients obtained in different edfs , assuming various definitions , can be found in sec .",
    "4.7 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in early hartree - fock ( hf ) and",
    "extended - thomas - fermi studies @xcite using various edfs , a correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath5 was pointed out .",
    "namely , edfs having large values of @xmath5 have also large @xmath6 . since the surface - symmetry coefficient is negative , these two terms act in opposite directions in @xmath7 . the correlation between bulk and surface symmetry energy",
    "was further discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite ; it was concluded that the presence of the correlation makes an absolute determination of @xmath5 and @xmath3 from nuclear masses difficult ( see also discussion in an early ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the experimental information about @xmath3 is fairly limited .",
    "the ratio of the surface - symmetry to symmetry ( or volume - symmetry ) coefficients , @xmath8 , has been estimated from the electric dipole strength distribution @xcite , masses @xcite , masses and radii @xcite , and excitation energies of isobaric analog states @xcite .",
    "recently , an attempt has been made to extract @xmath3 @xcite from the separation energies through the displacement of neutron and proton chemical potentials .",
    "they noted a large @xmath0-variation of @xmath9 .",
    "as discussed later , the dft values of @xmath9 obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite are fairly consistent with phenomenological estimates .",
    "since the absolute value of @xmath10 is not well constrained by experimental data on ground - state ( g.s . ) nuclear properties , one needs to find some mechanism that would enhance the surface - symmetry term with respect to the dominant volume symmetry energy .",
    "since the surface - symmetry energy increases with both neutron excess and the nuclear surface area , it is anticipated that strongly deformed configurations of nuclei with appreciable neutron excess can be of help .",
    "indeed , the nuclear shape deformation increases the surface area thus amplifying the surface - symmetry energy in a neutron - rich nucleus .",
    "conversely , the precise determination of surface - symmetry energy is important to describe the deformability of neutron - rich systems and validate theoretical extrapolations . in this context",
    ", one can mention several phenomena involving neutron excess and deformation :    * _ position of the neutron drip line_. deformed nuclei are expected in several regions near the neutron drip line @xcite . in some cases , deformation energy can impact their mere existence .",
    "for instance , it has been predicted that there exist particle - bound even - even nuclei that have at the same time negative two - neutron separation energies due to shape coexistence effects @xcite . * _ borders of the superheavy region_. the super- and hyperheavy nuclei with @xmath11 @xmath12126 can exist in states associated with very exotic topologies of nuclear density as the competition between coulomb , surface , symmetry , and shell effects can give rise to formation of voids @xcite .",
    "the subject of exotic ( bubble , toroidal , band - like ) configurations in nuclei with very large atomic numbers has been addressed by several studies @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to say at present whether these exotic topologies can occur as metastable states @xcite and what is their stability to various shape deformations . * _ fusion and fission of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "_ synthesis of heavy and superheavy neutron - rich nuclei is profoundly affected by nuclear deformability through the energetics of fusion and fission valleys @xcite .",
    "our ability to describe fission of neutron - rich systems is also important for modeling nuclear reactors . while dft calculations are currently able to predict barrier heights of known nuclei with a typical accuracy of 20% , the resulting uncertainties in fission cross sections are still large @xcite .",

    ", we study the surface - symmetry contribution to the ldm energy and demonstrate that it may be as important as the coulomb term in driving deformation properties of very neutron - rich systems . using the self - consistent dft , we survey excitation energies of superdeformed ( sd ) states in the hg - pb region and sd fission isomers in the actinides . by subtracting microscopic shell corrections",

    "the justification of ( [ eq_ldm_sph ] ) can be given in terms of the leptodermous expansion valid for systems with a well developed surface @xcite that sorts the various contributions to the binding energy of finite nuclei in terms that have transparent physical meaning .",
    "the expansion ( [ eq_ldm_sph ] ) can be extended to higher orders @xcite .",
    "the second - order symmetry energy term @xmath21 is not always included in the macroscopic ldm but it naturally present in the microscopic ldm expression @xcite .",
    "some ldm parameters are fundamental nmps and can be determined microscopically from ab - initio calculations of the equation of state of nucleonic matter @xcite .",
    "another , phenomenological strategy is to obtain ldm constants , or at least some of them , from a direct fit to selected experimental data from finite nuclei .",
    "the original work of myers and swiatecki followed such a strategy @xcite : by modeling local fluctuations in particle numbers due to shell effects , one can extract smooth ldm trends from experimental nuclear masses .",
    "subsequent refinements involved the upgrade from a simple drop to a more accurate droplet model @xcite , which allowed to pin down additional terms in the leptodermous expansion .",
    "further refinements can be found in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "just as in the microscopic approach , whose outcome depends on both the input ( i.e. , nucleon - nucleon interactions ) and the theoretical method used to solve the many - body problem , the results of phenomenological procedure depend on the choice of fit - observables and prescription used to compute shell corrections ( see ref .",

    "there are significant correlations among the different ldm terms and some parameters are poorly determined @xcite . in particular , precise extraction of higher - order isospin - dependent terms requires abundant data for very neutron - rich and/or heavy nuclei , which are not available at present .",
    "an advantage of the macroscopic approach to bulk nuclear properties is that it can also be applied in the context of the nuclear dft .",
    "while some ldm constants pertaining to infinite or semi - infinite nmp can be extracted from edf parameterizations @xcite , surface and curvature terms are best determined by using the semi - classical approach @xcite or by removing the contribution from shell effects from self - consistent dft results @xcite .",

    ", one can notice the gradual relative decrease of the coulomb contribution - which depends only on the number of protons and proton density , and therefore remains relatively constant in value .",
    "this decrease is compensated by an increase of the surface - symmetry contribution . for the most neutron - rich nuclei considered here ,",
    "the total contribution from @xmath95 is as large as 19% for skm*. for the two parametrizations selected here , the role of the surface - symmetry term increases by a factor 3 from @xmath27u to the fission recycling region .",
    "this work contains a comprehensive study of deformation properties of nuclear energy density functionals based on the leptodermous expansion of the smooth nuclear energy .",
    "since symmetry and surface - symmetry terms in the expansion are strongly correlated , a way to resolve them is to consider data on deformed neutron - rich nuclei , in which the surface - symmetry term is amplified .",
    "based on intuitive ldm arguments , we argue that deformation properties of neutron - rich nuclear drops are governed by an interplay of the deformation - driving coulomb and surface - symmetry terms , and the surface energy that acts against shape deformation . to estimate this interplay , we extracted the smooth deformation part of the hfb energy by means of the shell correction procedure .",
    "self - consistent dft calculations for excitation energies of sd states show marked differences in their predictions depending on the parametrization used . for the set of edfs considered , the average rms deviation between predicted energies of sd states and experimental values is 1.26mev . within this set ,",
    "the msk1 parametrization provides the best overall reproduction of the data : the corresponding rms deviation is 0.53mev , and this set a benchmark for future improvements . for the subset of fission isomer data ,",
    "the best performer is ski4 : its rms deviation is 0.48mev .",
    "we showed that inter - parametrization differences reflect to a large extent macroscopic properties of edfs .",
    "in particular , our calculations indicate that the bulk deformation properties of actinides are strongly driven by surface - symmetry effects , while in the proton - rich @xmath13 nuclei there is more competition between the various macroscopic contributions .",

    "this result is especially important in the context of the fission recycling mechanism in the r - process and hot fission reactions leading to excited neutron - rich superheavy nuclei .",
