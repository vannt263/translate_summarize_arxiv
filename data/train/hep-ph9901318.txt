    "<S> perhaps the simplest way to get a factor of 1/3 into the elements of the mass matrices is through an adjoint higgs multiplet , @xmath55 . </S>",

    "<S> there are two ways to contract the @xmath5 indices , but it is easy to show that if @xmath59 , then only the _ flavor - antisymmetric _ piece contributes to the mass matrices . </S>",

    "<S> one also sees that because the operator being discussed contains the same @xmath61 that appears in the yukawa operator for the ( 33 ) entries , the @xmath28 entries of @xmath18 and @xmath62 are @xmath63 times those of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath66 needed for the @xmath28 entries arises in a simple fashion by integrating out a superheavy ( _ i.e. _ gut - scale ) family plus conjugate - family pair : @xmath67 and is naturally of order @xmath68 as required . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig . 1 . </S>",
    "<S> such an operator could also arise from planck - scale physics , but it would then be too small .    </S>",
    "<S> the next pieces of the mass matrices to be discussed are the  @xmath27 \" entries . </S>",
    "<S> these have several rationales , and are in fact the key to the whole model . </S>",
    "<S> we shall first explain how such entries arise , and then why they are important for getting a realistic model .    </S>",
    "<S> the feature of the @xmath27 entries that distinguishes them from what is found in most published models is that they are neither flavor - symmetric nor flavor - antisymmetric , but rather  lopsided \" : @xmath27 appears in @xmath69 but not in @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> though it is not common to consider such lopsided forms , there is really no reason from the point of view of grand unification not to do so . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it may well be the neglect of such possibilities that has handicapped the search for realistic quark and lepton mass matrices .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27 entries arise very simply from integrating out an @xmath5 vector @xmath71 of quarks and leptons as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . the resulting operator is of the form @xmath72_{10 } [ { \\bf 16}_3 { \\bf 16}'_h]_{10}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the notation @xmath73_{10}$ ] indicates that what is contained in the brackets is contracted into a @xmath71 of @xmath5 as a result of the virtual @xmath71 fermions appearing in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs multiplet denoted @xmath74 is assumed to develop a gut - scale vev in the @xmath75 direction , while the other spinor higgs , denoted @xmath76 , gets a weak - scale @xmath77-doublet vev in the @xmath78 direction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in @xmath50 notation , the operator from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 gives @xmath79 .    </S>",
    "<S> one observes that since the left - handed down - quarks are in @xmath71 s of @xmath50 , not @xmath80 s , this operator contributes to @xmath81 and not @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , since the left - handed leptons are in @xmath80 s , not @xmath71 s , the operator contributes to @xmath83 and not @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall see , this fact that the @xmath27 entry is transposed in @xmath16 relative to that in @xmath15 is very important for understanding the large @xmath85 mixing that may have been seen in the atmospheric neutrino data . </S>",
    "<S> this transposition is a consequence of the group theory of @xmath50 which also implies that @xmath86 in the minimal @xmath50 model .    </S>",
    "<S> the upshot is that integrating out @xmath71 s of fermions in @xmath5 can quite typically give just such lopsided entries as the @xmath27 entries in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath27 entries only appear in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and not in @xmath14 and @xmath17 , following from the fact that @xmath76 contains only @xmath80 and not @xmath87 of @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , why should such lopsided entries help to get a realistic model ? </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that these @xmath27 entries play at least six vital roles :    \\(i ) in the first place , it is easy to see from the seesaw - type formulas , that setting @xmath88 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) would give @xmath89 and @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> thus one would get a ratio of ratios of 1/9 instead of the desired georgi - jarlskog value of 1/3 . if , however , @xmath27 is present and is large compared to @xmath28 , then one has @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , so that the desired georgi - jarlskog factor emerges .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) without the @xmath27 entries , the ( 23 ) blocks of @xmath15 and @xmath14 would be proportional , and consequently there would be no km mixing for those families , that is @xmath10 would vanish .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iii ) moreover , the lopsided @xmath27 entries explain a peculiar fact about the magnitude of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath81 and @xmath82 were of equal magnitude , as is the case with the purely flavor - symmetric or antisymmetric forms usually assumed , then @xmath10 would get a contribution from @xmath15 that is @xmath93 , which is much too big ( by about a factor of 4 ) . by having the large lopsided contribution with @xmath94 , </S>",
    "<S> one finds @xmath95 , which leads to @xmath96 , as observed . </S>",
    "<S> this cures one of the main problems with textures of the fritzsch type @xcite as noted previously by branco and silva - marcos @xcite in a phenomenological study of the quark sector . </S>",
    "<S> other authors @xcite have also recently appreciated this fact in the context of @xmath50 models .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iv ) because @xmath27 naturally only appears in @xmath15 and @xmath16 but not in @xmath14 , one explains why @xmath97 and @xmath98 , as actually observed . in the absence of the @xmath27 entries , </S>",
    "<S> one would obtain the minimal @xmath5 prediction @xmath99 , which is wrong by about a factor of 20 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(v ) the fact that the large @xmath27 entry appears transposed in @xmath16 relative to @xmath15 means that it makes the ( 32 ) mixing of the left - handed leptons _ </S>",
    "<S> large _ compared to the corresponding mixing of the left - handed quarks . </S>",
    "<S> one thus explains why @xmath4 mixing is much larger than @xmath10 , which is one of the great puzzles in understanding the atmospheric neutrino oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(vi ) finally , we shall see later that the @xmath27 entries explain why the @xmath100 mixing angle is significantly smaller than @xmath101 , assuming the small - angle msw solution of the solar neutrino problem .    what remains to be explained about the mass matrices in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) are the entries @xmath38 and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> these arise very simply from the diagrams in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . note that because the effective operators are again of the form @xmath102 , as for the @xmath27 entries , these diagrams only contribute to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and not to @xmath14 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> note also that because they come from integrating out a @xmath71 of higgs , they are _ flavor - symmetric_. these contributions are assumed to be much smaller than the others .    the fact that the above terms appear and no others presupposes that some abelian symmetries exist that distinguish among families . </S>",

    "<S> one would find the familiar type of prediction , @xmath147 , which is much too large . </S>",

    "<S> this leads to the suppression of @xmath126 by a factor of @xmath148 , which brings it into the experimentally allowed range @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the point is that since some higher order effects are presumed to generate a mass for the @xmath19 quark , the same effects are likely to make a small contribution to the masses of @xmath107 and @xmath154 as well , though that is not necessarily the case . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath20 could arise from @xmath155 , and a comparable entry in @xmath16 of order @xmath156 would affect @xmath22 at the 3% level . </S>",

    "<S> four other predictions are non - trivial quantitative successes of the model . </S>",
    "<S> they are a prediction of the charm quark mass that is correct within the present uncertainties ; the prediction of very large mixing between @xmath118 and @xmath119 , consistent with the recent discovery of atmospheric neutrino oscillations ; a prediction for @xmath12 that slices neatly through the middle of the allowed region for the wolfenstein parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; and a prediction for @xmath163 that is well inside the present allowed range for the small - angle msw solution of the solar neutrino problem .    </S>",
