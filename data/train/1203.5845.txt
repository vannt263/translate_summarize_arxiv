    "assimilating large data sets into mathematical models of time - evolving systems presents a major challenge in a wide range of applications .",
    "since the data and the model are often uncertain , a natural overarching framework for the formulation of such problems is that of bayesian statistics .",
    "however , for high dimensional models , investigation of the bayesian posterior distribution of model state given data is not computationally feasible in on - line situations .",
    "for this reason various _ ad hoc _ filters are used .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of such filters .",
    "the paradigmatic example of data assimilation is weather forecasting : computational models to predict the state of the atmosphere currently involving on the order of @xmath0 unknowns but these models must be run with an initial condition which is only known incompletely .",
    "this is compensated for by a large number , currently on the order of @xmath1 , partial observations of the atmosphere at subsequent times .",
    "filters are widely used to make forecasts which combine the mathematical model of the atmosphere and the data to make predictions .",
    "indeed the particular method of data assimilation which we study here includes , as a special case , the algorithm commonly known as 3dvar .",
    "this method originated in weather forecasting .",
    "it was first proposed at the uk met office in 1986 @xcite , and was developed by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) soon thereafter ; see @xcite .",
    "more details of the implementation of 3dvar by the uk met office can be found in @xcite , and by the european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) in @xcite .",
    "the 3dvar algorithm is prototypical of the many more sophisticated filters which are now widely used in practice and it is thus natural to study it . the reader should be aware , however , that the development of new filters is a very active area and that the analysis here constitutes an initial step towards the analyses required for these more recently developed algorithms . for insight into some of these more sophisticated filters see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "filtering can be performed exactly for linear systems subject to gaussian noise : the kalman filter @xcite . for nonlinear or non - gaussian scenarios",
    "the particle filter @xcite may be used and provably approximates the desired probability distribution as the number of particles is increased @xcite .",
    "however in practice this method performs poorly in high dimensional systems @xcite . whilst there is considerable research activity aimed at overcoming this degeneration @xcite",
    ", the methodology can not yet be viewed as a provably accurate tool within the context of the high dimensional problems arising in geophysical data assimilation . in order to circumvent problems associated with the representation of high dimensional probability distributions some form of _ ad hoc _",
    "gaussian approximation is typically used to create practical filters , and the 3dvar method which we analyze here is perhaps the simplest example of this . this _",
    "ad hoc _ filters may also be viewed in the framework of nonlinear control theory .",
    "proving filter stability and accuracy has a long history in this field and the paper @xcite is closely related to the work we develop here .",
    "however we work in an infinite dimensional setting , in order to directly confront the high dimensionality of many current real - world filtering applications , and this brings new issues to the problem of establishing filter stability and accuracy ; overcoming these problems provides the focus of this paper .    in the paper @xcite a wide range of gaussian approximate filters , including 3dvar ,",
    "are evaluated by comparing the distributions they produce with a highly accurate ( and impractical in realistic online scenarios ) mcmc simulation of the desired distributions .",
    "the conclusion of that work is that the gaussian approximate filters perform well in tracking the mean of the desired distribution , but poorly in terms of statistical variability about the mean . in this paper",
    "we provide a theoretical analysis of the ability of the filters to estimate the mean state accurately .",
    "although filtering is widely used in practice , much of the analysis of it , in the context of fluid mechanics , works with finite - dimensional dynamical models .",
    "our aim is to work directly with a pde model relevant in fluid mechanics , the navier - stokes equation , and thereby confront the high - dimensional nature of the problem head - on .",
    "study of the stability of filters for data assimilation has been a developing research area over the last few years and the paper @xcite contains a finite dimensional theoretical result , numerical experiments in a variety of finite and ( discretized ) infinite dimensional systems not covered by the theory , and references to relevant applied literature .",
    "the paper @xcite gives a review of many important aspects relating to assimilating the evolving unstable directions of the underlying dynamical system .",
    "our analysis will build in a concrete fashion on the approach in @xcite and @xcite which were amongst the first to study data assimilation directly through pde analysis , using ideas from the theory of determining modes in infinite dimensional dynamical systems .",
    "however , in contrast to those papers , we will allow for noisy observations in our analysis .",
    "nonetheless the estimates in @xcite form an important component of our analysis .",
    "furthermore the large time asymptotic results in @xcite constitute a limiting case of our theory , where there is no observational noise .",
    "the presentation will be organized as follows : in section [ sec : combine ] we introduce the navier - stokes equation as the forward model of interest and formulate the inverse problem of estimating the velocity field given partial noisy observations .",
    "this leads to a family of filters for the velocity field which have the form of a non - autonomous dynamical system which blends the forward model with the data in a judicious fashion ; theorem [ t : min ] describes this dynamical system via the solution of a sequence of inverse problems . in section",
    "[ sec : stability ] we introduce notions of stability and prove the main theorems [ t : m ] and [ t : mz ] concerning filter stability and accuracy for sufficiently small observational noise . in section",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we present numerical results which corroborate the analysis ; and finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present conclusions .",
    "in subsection [ ssec : nse ] we describe the forward model that we employ throughout the remainder of the paper : the navier stokes equation on a two dimensional torus .",
    "then , in subsection [ ssec : filters ] , we describe the observational data model that we employ ; using this we apply tikhonov - phillips regularization to derive the filter which we use to combine model and data .",
    "subsection [ ssec:3dvar ] contains a specific example of this filter , used later in the paper for our numerical illustrations .",
    "this example constitutes a particular instance of the 3dvar method .      in this section",
    "we establish a notation for , and describe the properties of , the navier - stokes equation .",
    "this is the forward model which underlies the inverse problem which we study in this paper .",

    "finally , when @xmath322 ( fig .",
    "[ a1.100 ] ) , the estimator really diverges from the signal , although still remains bounded .    when @xmath294 the lower and upper bounds are almost indistinguishable and , for all values of @xmath166 examined , the error either exceeds or fluctuates around the upper bound ; see figures [ am1.1 ] , [ am1.10 ] and [ am1.100 ] where @xmath323 and @xmath324 respectively .",

    "[ am1.100 ] ) that the estimator really loses the signal .",
    "notice also that the high modes of the estimator always follow the noisy observations and this could be undesirable .",
    "for both @xmath322 and @xmath325 , the @xmath294 estimator performs better than the one for @xmath297 in terms of overall error , illustrating the robustness alluded to in remark [ r:2 ] since for @xmath170 we have @xmath326 however , an appropriately tuned @xmath297 filter has the potential to perform remarkably well , both in terms of overall error and individual error of all modes ( see fig . [ a1.1 ] , in contrast to fig .",
    "[ am1.1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , this filter has an expected error substantially smaller than the upper bound , which does not happen for the case of @xmath294 when complete observations are assimilated .",

    "[ am1.10.p10 ] .",
    "this improvement , and indeed the improvement beyond setting @xmath330 for both cases @xmath293 disappears as @xmath77 is decreased .",
    "in particular , when @xmath331 the error is never very much smaller than the upper bound . this is due to the fact that the dynamics of the low wavevectors tend to be unpredictable and they contain very little useful information for the assimilation .",
    "then , for much smaller @xmath332 , once enough unstable modes are left unobserved , there is no convergence .",
    "the order of magnitude of the error in the asymptotic regime as a function of @xmath166 remains roughly consistent as @xmath77 is decreased until the estimator no longer converges . for small @xmath333 ( high - frequency in time observations ) and complete observations ,",
    "the estimator can be slow to converge to the asymptotic regime . in this case , the number of iterations until convergence , for a sufficiently small @xmath166 , becomes significantly larger as @xmath77 is decreased ( again until the estimator fails to converge at all ) .",
    "given @xmath334 , we expect that for @xmath166 sufficiently small the contribution of the model to the filter will be negligible for all @xmath91 with @xmath335 for @xmath297 . hence the estimators for both @xmath293 will behave similarly .",

    "there are enough observations to draw the higher wavevectors of the estimator closer to the truth than if we just set the population of those modes to zero .",
    "in contrast , as mentioned above , when @xmath331 , there are not enough observations even when they are all used , and the error is roughly the same as the upper bound as @xmath338 ( not shown ) .",
    "this paper contains three main components :    * we show that the filtering problem for the navier - stokes equation may be formulated as a a sequence of well - posed inverse problems : theorem [ t : min ] ; * we prove theorems [ t : m ] and [ t : mz ] , which establish filter accuracy and stability provided variance inflation is employed ; * we describe numerical results which illustrate , and extend the validity of , the theory .",
    "we note that the analysis will also apply to other semilinear dissipative pdes which possess a squeezing property ( contraction when projected into the high modes ) and a global attractor ; such equations are studied in depth in @xcite , and include the cahn - allen and cahn - hilliard equations , the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation and ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "these two structural properties of the underlying model , when combined with sufficient variance inflation ( @xmath166 small enough in 3dvar ) enable proof that the 3dvar filter has a contractive property , even when the underlying dynamical system itself has positive lyapunov exponents .",
