    "the idea that superconductivity and quantum chromodyanmics have common features has long history .",
    "probably the first time this idea was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was suggested that the confinement of quarks into hadrons may happen due to a condensation of a special gluonic configurations called abelian monopoles . in this approach",
    " referred to as the dual superconductivity scenario  a condensate of the monopoles breaks spontaneously an internal @xmath3 gauge symmetry . according to the dual superconductor idea ,",
    "the breaking of the dual symmetry gives rise naturally to the dual meissner effect , which insures a formation of a qcd flux tube , which in turn leads to the confinement the quarks into hadronic bound states . in this paper",
    "we want to explore a similar idea in both directions : from quantum chromodynamics to high - t@xmath0 superconductivity and vice versa .    in high - t@xmath0 superconductivity",
    "there is an opinion that a few kind of quasi particles ( phonos , magnons , excitons and so on ) may play the role of carrying the interaction between electrons in high - t@xmath0 superconductor .",
    "it is similar to yang - mills gauge fields where the gauge potential @xmath4 has several components @xmath5 . in non - abelian gauge theories",
    "also it is important that the different @xmath6 and @xmath7 interact between themselves .",
    "we transfer this observation to high - t@xmath0 superconductivity and suppose that for every kind of cooper pair ( where the interaction is carried with the definite quasi particles : phonons , magnons and so on ) we can write the ginzburg - landau ( gl)-equation and all gl - equations have interaction terms describing the interaction between different kinds of quasi particles .",
    "in quantum chromodynamics we use the idea from superconductivity that the cooper electrons ( which have an interaction with phonons ) can be described ( in the first phenomenological approximation ) with the gl - equation . in quantum chromodynamics",
    "this idea takes the form : every two gluons have an interaction between themselves via gluons .",
    "therefore we assume that such interacting gluons can be described using the gl - equation .",
    "but in this case gluons do not form pairs like cooper pairs and the wave function @xmath8 in the gl - equation will describe not pairs of gluons but a condensate made of _ all _ gluons .",
    "another feature of this phenomenological approach in quantum chromodynamics is that we assume that there are two kind of condensate : the first one describes correlated gluons ( condensate @xmath1 ) belonging to an @xmath9 subgroup and the second one describes correlated gluons ( condensate @xmath2 ) belonging to the coset @xmath10 .    the main goal of the idea presented here is to show that : ( a ) a high - t@xmath0 superconductor may have the space - separated regions where the interaction between cooper electrons is carried out by different kind of quantum ( either phonons , or magnons , or excitons or and so on ) ; ( b ) the similar situation may happen in quantum chromodynamics where the regions filled with different kind of a nonperturbative gauge condensate may exist .",
    "in high - t@xmath0 superconductivity there exist several candidates for the role of pseudoparticles which carry the interaction between electrons : phonons , magnons , excitons and so on .",
    "some researchers argue that patterns of charges , currents , waves of magnetism , or phonons play a crucial role for understanding high - t@xmath0 superconductivity . pairing",
    "might even require all of these things in combination . in this paper",
    "we assume that there is an interaction between phonons , magnons and so on . from this point of view",
    "we consider the following approximate phenomenological model : for every kind of interaction ( phonons , magnons and so on ) we can write the gl - equation . in the consequence of such an assumed interaction between phonons , magnons and so on we have to have interaction terms in every gl - equation .    for the simplicity we will consider here only two connected gl - equations corresponding to two kind of interactions between electrons in high - t@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "let us at first consider the possible form of the interaction term .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that the term is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a constant ; @xmath13 are wave functions describing cooper pairs where the electrons interact either via phonons or , magnons or another quanta .",
    "we suppose also that @xmath14 which means that the interaction is repulsive . as we see",
    "later this leads to the displacement of one condensate by another .",
    "this term can be considered as the first nonlinear term in the taylor expansion of any potential @xmath15 .    after some redefinitions of coefficients of two interacting gl - equations they can be written in the following way @xmath16 \\psi_1 & = & 0 ,   \\label{1 - 20 } \\\\",
    "- \\delta \\psi_2 + \\left [           \\left| \\psi_1 \\right|^2 + \\lambda_2 \\left (              \\left| \\psi_2 \\right|^2 - \\frac{e_2}{\\lambda_2 }          \\right )      \\right ] \\psi_2 & = & 0   \\label{1 - 30}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 constants , @xmath18 parameters .",
    "the most interesting is that they have _ regular _ solutions which are missing in a single gl - equation . in the author s opinion",
    "these regular solutions describe the following situation : there exists a ground state filled with @xmath1 or @xmath2 , then the solution are plane , cylindrically or spherically symmetric patterns in the ground state . in other words",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 repel each other .    the potential energy of the interacting wave functions @xmath13 is @xmath19 use of two fields @xmath13 ensures presence of two global minima of the potential at @xmath20 and two local minima at @xmath21 for values of the parameters @xmath22 used in the paper .",
    "the conditions for existence of the local minima are : @xmath23 , and for the global minima : @xmath24 .",
    "the presence of these minima has allowed to find solutions localized on the plane , tube and ball when the solutions have tended asymptotically to one of the local minima .",
    "in ref s  @xcite @xcite the idea is considered that there is a connection between condensed matter physics and quantum chromodynamics . in ref .  @xcite it is shown that using a spin  charge separation of the gluon field in the landau gauge the @xmath25 yang - mills theory in the low - temperature phase can be considered as a nematic liquid crystal . in ref s",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite the idea of slave - boson decomposition is transferred into quantum chromodynamics which gives us the so called spin - charge separation for the gauge fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is supposed that phonons have a strong interaction between themselves similar to the strong interaction between gluons in quantum chromodynamics . in quantum chromodynamics",
    "such strong interaction leads to a flux tube stretched between quarks . in consequence of this similarity",
    "it is supposed that the phonons in a superconductor are confined in a tube similar to the flux tube in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "here we would like to investigate similar connections applying to quantum chromodynamics .    in a superconductor",
    "the cooper electrons are paired as a consequence of phonon interactions and this picture on the phenomenological level can be considered by using the gl - equation . in quantum chromodynamics",
    "any two gluons have an interaction between themselves .",
    "one distinction with the superconductivity is that the interaction between quantum ( two gluons ) is carried by the same quantum ( gluons ) .",
    "nevertheless we assume that ( in the first approximation ) the gl - equation can be applied for the description of gluons .",
    "in fact it will be a non - perturbative , phenomenological picture of gauge fields in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "we want to make one distinction in quantum chromodynamics in comparison with the superconductivity .",
    "we suppose that the su(3 ) gauge fields in quantum chromodynamics are divided into two different fields : the first one is in the subalgebra @xmath9 and the second one is in the coset @xmath10 .",
    "it means that we have two gl - equations . as su(3 ) yang - mills lagrangian has the term describing the interaction between @xmath26 and @xmath27 fields we should have an interaction term in both gl - equations .",
    "thus we propose to apply two interacting gl - equations - for an approximate description of nonperturbative quantized su(3 ) gauge field : @xmath1 describes a condensate of nonperturbative quantized @xmath28 gauge field and @xmath2 described a condensate of @xmath29 gauge field .",
    "the term @xmath30 in both gl - equations represents the term @xmath31 in the su(3 ) yang - mills lagrangian .    in the section [ patterns ]",
    "we will present numerical solutions which show that in quantum chromodynamics there may exist a situation as follows : the ground state is the condensate @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) . in this state there exist patterns where the condensate @xmath2 ( or @xmath1 ) pushes out @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) .",
    "in this section we would like to present the solutions of two interacting gl - equations with planar , cylindrical and spherical symmetries .",
    "in this case eq s have the following form @xmath32 here we are searching for @xmath13 as real functions ; the coordinate @xmath33 is the cartesian coordinate that is transversal to the planar pattern .",
    "the regular solutions of the system of nonlinear differential equations - could exist only for some values of the self - coupling constants @xmath17 and the energies @xmath18 .",
    "the further task consists in a search of such parameters @xmath18 which give regular solutions . in this sense",
    "the problem reduces to a search of _ eigenvalues _ of the parameters @xmath18 and corresponding _ eigenfunctions _ @xmath13 for two gl - equations - .",
    "the technique of solution of systems similar to - is described in ref .",
    "@xcite in details .",
    "the essence of this procedure is the following : on the first step one solve the equation with some arbitrary selected function @xmath2 looking for a regular solution existing only at some value of the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "then this solution for the function @xmath1 insert into the equation and one search for a value of the parameter @xmath35 yielding a regular solution .",
    "this procedure reiterate several times ( six usually enough ) for obtaining of acceptable convergence of values of the parameters @xmath18 .",
    "the described procedure of a search of solutions of the system - , also known as the shooting method , allows to find rather fast values of the parameters @xmath18 at which regular solutions exist .",
    "the boundary conditions are choosing with account of @xmath36 symmetry in the following form : @xmath37 then , using the above procedure for obtaining of solutions of the system - , we have the results presented in fig .  - .",
    "these results are obtained for the energies @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "as one can see from fig .  , @xmath40 and @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",
    "it corresponds to asymptotic transition of the solutions to the local minimum of the potential .",
    "let us estimate an asymptotic behaviour of the solutions .",
    "for this purpose we will seek for solutions of the equations - in the form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding asymptotic equations for the scalar fields - will be rewritten as : @xmath46 with the exponentially fast damping solutions @xmath47 where @xmath48 are integration constants .",

    "thus the physical consequances of the model presented above are :    * a high - t@xmath0 superconductor and nonperturbative gluon condensate ( in quantum chromodynamics ) may have the regions with different physical properties ; * in high - t@xmath0 superconductor these regions differ from each other that in each region the interaction between cooper electrons is carried out by different quantum ( phonons , magnons , excitons and so on ) ; * in quantum chromodynamics these regions filled with different kind of a gauge condensate .    in the presented picture",
    "high - t@xmath0 superconductivity and quantum chromodynamics have many common features . both have fermions ( quarks in quantum chromodynamics and electrons in high - t@xmath0 superconductivity ) interacting via gluons ( quantum chromodynamics ) and phonons , magnons and so on ( in high - t@xmath0 superconductivity ) . in quantum chromodynamics",
    "the gluons are the quanta of strongly interacting gauge field .",
    "this is the reason for a nonpeturbative quantization .",
    "the problem in quantum chromodynamics is the quark confinement which appears in the fact that two quarks interact so strongly that they can not be separated .",
    "the main opinion here is that between quarks there is a pattern ( flux tube ) filled with a parallel chromoelectric color field .    in the presented model of two interacting gl - equations for high - t@xmath0 superconductivity",
    "the situation is similar : there are electrons which are combined into cooper pairs ( or one can say that all electrons are in a strongly correlated state ) and the interactions between them carries out with phonons , magnons and so on which have a strong interaction between themselves . by analogy with quantum chromodynamics where there exist patterns filled with the gauge field ( flux tubes between quarks ) one can assume that in high - t@xmath0 superconductivity there exist patterns filled with electrons combined into cooper pairs via either phonons , or magnons , or and so on .    for quantum chromodynamics",
    "we have proposed a similar picture : two interacting gl - equations describing two kinds of gauge condensates : the first kind of gauge potential components are in a subalgebra and the second one are in the coset .",
    "then we have shown that the set of two interacting gl - equations have very interesting regular solutions not found in one gl - equation .",
    "these solutions are patterns where one kind of a condensate is pushed out by another one ."
