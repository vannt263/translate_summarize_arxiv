    "entanglement measures have been the focus of an intense research activity in condensed matter theory , quantum information , quantum field theory and quantum gravity during the last decade .",
    "the most celebrated one among them is the entanglement entropy , which measures the entanglement between two complementary parts when the whole system is in a pure state @xcite . considering a quantum system in its ground state @xmath0 , or in any other pure state , and assuming that its hilbert space is factorized as @xmath1 , the @xmath2 s reduced density matrix is defined as @xmath3 , being @xmath4 the density matrix of the whole system .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath5 , which characterizes a mixed state , is normalized by requiring that @xmath6 .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath7 is the von neumann entropy associated to @xmath5 .",
    "analogously , one can introduce @xmath8 and , since @xmath9 corresponds to a pure quantum state , we have that @xmath10 . in quantum field theory ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is usually computed by employing the replica limit , namely [ eedef replica ] s_a - ( _ a _ a ) = _ n 1 s_a^(n ) , where @xmath11 are the rnyi entropies , which are defined as follows [ renyi def ] s_a^(n ) . from this expression and the normalization condition for @xmath5 , it is straightforward to find that @xmath12 . typically , @xmath13 is known for positive integers @xmath14 and therefore it must be analytically continued to real values of @xmath14 in order to perform the replica limit ( [ eedef replica ] ) .    in quantum field theory , the entanglement entropy is a divergent quantity when @xmath15 , being @xmath16 the uv cutoff . in many cases the coefficient of the leading divergence is proportional to the area of @xmath17 and this property is known as the area law for the entanglement entropy .",
    "this rule has some important exceptions and the main one is a generic two dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) at zero temperature . considering an infinite line and an interval of length @xmath18 as the subsystem @xmath2 , we have that @xmath17 is made by the two endpoints of the interval and it is well known that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the central charge of the model @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review ) .    an important configuration to study is when the subsystem @xmath21 is made by two disjoint spatial regions @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see fig.[fig : intro ] , top panel , for one spatial dimension ) . in this case , it is convenient to introduce the mutual information , which is defined as [ midef ] i_a_1,a_2 s_a_1+s_a_2-s_a_1 a_2 = _",
    "n 1 i_a_1,a_2^(n ) , where in the last step we have emphasized that @xmath24 can be found as the replica limit of the following combination of rnyi entropies [ renyimi ] i_a_1,a_2^(n ) s^(n)_a_1+s^(n)_a_2-s^(n)_a_1 a_2 = r_2,n , r_2,n .",
    "the subadditivity of the entanglement entropy guarantees that @xmath25 and the leading divergence of the different terms cancels in the combination ( [ midef ] ) when the area law holds .",
    "moreover , the mutual information ( [ midef ] ) could contain more physical information with respect to the entanglement entropy of a single region .",
    "for instance , in two dimensional cfts , while @xmath7 of a single interval depends only on the central charge , the mutual information @xmath24 encodes all the cft data of the model ( conformal dimensions of the primaries and ope coefficients ) @xcite .",
    "the mutual information has been studied also through the holographic approach @xcite .     made by either two ( top ) or three ( middle ) disjoint intervals and the remainder @xmath26 .",
    "bottom : the entanglement between two disjoint intervals @xmath22 and @xmath23 embedded in a larger system in its ground state made by @xmath27 and the reminder @xmath26 . in cft correlation functions of branch - point twist fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 placed at the endpoints of the intervals must be computed to get either the entanglement entropy ( top and middle panels ) or logarithmic negativity ( bottom panel ) through the proper replica limit . ,",
    "width=566 ]    taking the limit @xmath30 in ( [ eedef replica ] ) and ( [ midef ] ) in many interesting cases is highly non trivial .",
    "for instance , the analytic continuation of the rnyi entropies of a single interval for the excited states given by the primaries @xcite has been studied in @xcite . for the excited states given by the descendants a closed expression for all the rnyi entropies",
    "is still not known @xcite .",
    "interesting features have been observed by considering the rnyi entropies of a single interval in critical one dimensional models for real @xmath14 but no singularities have been found @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the case of disjoint intervals for some models in one spatial dimension .",
    "the rnyi entropies for a subsystem @xmath2 made by @xmath31 disjoint intervals ( see fig.[fig : intro ] , middle panel for @xmath32 ) are given by the partition function of the model on a riemann surface of genus @xmath33 .",
    "these partition functions can be computed for some simple cfts like the massless compact boson and the ising model @xcite but finding the corresponding analytic continuations in the most generic case is still beyond our knowledge . for two spatial dimensions , already",
    "the simple case of the entanglement entropy of a disk could lead to a difficult replica limit @xcite .",
    "another interesting quantity to consider is the logarithmic negativity , which is a measure of entanglement for bipartite mixed states @xcite .",
    "let us consider a pure or mixed state characterized by the density matrix @xmath9 acting on a bipartite hilbert space @xmath34 and the arbitrary bases @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively . the important object to introduce is the partial transpose of @xmath39 with respect to one of the two parts . considering e.g. the partial transposition with respect to the second part , the matrix element of @xmath40 is defined as follows [ partialtransp ] e_i^(1 ) e_j^(2)| _",
    "a_1a_2^t_2| e_k^(1 ) e_l^(2)= e_i^(1 ) e_l^(2)| _ a_1a_2| e_k^(1 ) e_j^(2 ) .",
    "then , the logarithmic negativity is given by [ logneg def ] |_a_1a_2^t_2| , where @xmath41 is the trace norm of the hermitean matrix @xmath40 , which is the sum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues .",
    "taking into account the traces @xmath42 of integer powers of @xmath40 , it is not difficult to observe that a parity effect occurs . in particular , considering the sequence of the odd powers @xmath43 and the one of the even powers @xmath44 , the logarithmic negativity ( [ logneg def ] ) can be found through the following replica limit @xcite [ replica limit neg ] = _ n_e 1 ( _ a_1a_2^t_2 ) ^n_e .",
    "notice that for @xmath45 one simply recovers the normalization condition @xmath46 .",
    "for a bipartite pure state a relation occurs between @xmath42 and the renyi entropies which tells us that the logarithmic negativity reduces to the rnyi entropy of order @xmath47 .",
    "however , we are interested in the logarithmic negativity of mixed states and the reduced density matrix is an important example .",
    "thus , given a quantum system in a pure state and considering the reduced density matrix @xmath39 of two adjacent or disjoint spatial regions , while @xmath48 measures the entanglement between @xmath49 and the complementary region @xmath26 , the logarithmic negativity in ( [ logneg def ] ) measures the entanglement between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see fig.[fig : intro ] , bottom panel , for one spatial dimension ) .",
    "in two dimensional cfts , the logarithmic negativity has been studied in @xcite for zero temperature , at finite temperature @xcite and also out of equilibrium ( the time evolution after a global quench @xcite and after a local quench @xcite have been considered ) . for two disjoint intervals at zero temperature @xmath42",
    "must be computed case by case because it encodes all the cft data .",
    "the replica limit ( [ replica limit neg ] ) for these expressions turns out to be difficult to compute , like for the mutual information . indeed , analytic results have not been found for all the possible configurations of intervals .    in this paper",
    "we numerically extrapolate the entanglement entropy and the logarithmic negativity through their replica limits , which are respectively ( [ eedef replica ] ) and ( [ replica limit neg ] ) , for simple two dimensional cft models and for configurations of intervals whose analytic continuations for @xmath7 and @xmath50 are not known . in particular , for the free massless boson , both compactified and in the decompactification regime , and for the ising model , @xmath51 are known analytically for a generic number @xmath31 of disjoint intervals @xcite , while @xmath42 is known analytically for two disjoint intervals @xcite .",
    "we consider some of these models for two or three disjoint intervals ( only some configurations in the latter case ) and employ a numerical method based on rational interpolations to get the corresponding entanglement entropy or logarithmic negativity .",
    "this extrapolating method has been first suggested in this context by @xcite ( see @xcite for other numerical methods ) .",
    "we checked our extrapolations against numerical results found through the corresponding lattice models whenever they are available in the literature , finding very good agreement ; otherwise the method provides numerical predictions that could be useful benchmarks for future studies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",

    "the numerical extrapolation of the analytic expressions for @xmath52 to @xmath30 leads to the mutual information , which can be compared with the corresponding numerical results found from the xxz spin chain and the ising chain in a transverse field .",

    "these fields have been largely studied in the early days of string theory @xcite and their crucial role for the entanglement computations has been exploited during the last decade .",

    "the extrapolation to @xmath124 corresponding to @xmath214 can not be trusted and therefore we consider four input data @xmath283 which allow to consider a rational interpolation with , for instance , @xmath284 and also @xmath285 .",

    "we can choose also @xmath272 finding that the corresponding rational interpolation basically coincides with the one with @xmath285 ( their difference is of order @xmath286 ) .",

    ", one can find the blue curve in fig.[fig : ri_ex_inset ] . as a further check , in fig.[fig : ri_fps ] we have used @xmath287 using more input data , finding that the final extrapolation is basically the same .",
    "plots like the one shown in the inset of fig.[fig : ri_ex_inset ] are very useful to understand the stability of the extrapolation to @xmath124 .",
    "increasing the values of @xmath75 and @xmath125 in the rational interpolations leads to more precise extrapolations , as expected .",
    "rational interpolations with @xmath276 provide extrapolations which are closer to the expected value with respect to the ones with @xmath277 . when @xmath125 is strictly positive ,",
    "@xmath125 poles occur in the complex plane parameterized by @xmath288 . nevertheless , if these poles are far enough from the real interval @xmath258 containing all the @xmath14 s employed as input data for the interpolation , the extrapolations to @xmath124 are reliable .",
    "increasing @xmath125 , we have higher probability that one of the poles is close to the region of interpolation , spoiling the extrapolation . plotting @xmath289 as function of @xmath14 is useful to realize whether this situation occurs ( see the inset of fig.[fig : ri_ex2_inset ] for an explicit example ) .     in ( [ i3n def ] ) for the compact boson , computed through ( [ rnn cft n=3 ] ) and ( [ f nint compact boson ] ) for @xmath123 . our limited computational power in evaluating riemann theta functions for large matrices prevented us to consider @xmath290 in the whole range of configurations and this limits also the possible rational interpolations that can be employed .",
    "the blu line is the extrapolation found by using only @xmath291 , which should not be considered as a prediction because more @xmath14 s are needed to find stable extrapolations .",
    "the orange line is a check of the method for @xmath178 : the fact that the expected points are not precisely recovered is due to low number of @xmath14 s ( @xmath213 ) available . in the inset ,",
    "considering the configuration having @xmath292 , we show @xmath293 as function of @xmath14 for rational interpolations having different @xmath121 .",
    "the rational interpolation with @xmath294 ( red line ) shows a bad behaviour and the extrapolation to @xmath124 can not be trusted ; indeed , the red curve in the main plot is different from the other extrapolations .",

    "increasing @xmath125 improves the extrapolation but in some regimes of @xmath70 wrong results can be found .",
    "the dashed red curve is the analytic continuation for the regime @xmath243 found in @xcite , while the points are obtained through a periodic harmonic chain ( [ hc ham ] ) with @xmath111 sites . ,",
    "width=566 ]    the issue of evaluating riemann theta functions which involve large matrices becomes important when we want to compute @xmath210 ( see ( [ i3 def ] ) and ( [ i3n def ] ) ) for a compact boson .",
    "indeed , @xmath183 in ( [ rnn cft n=3 ] ) is given by ( [ f nint compact boson ] ) for @xmath32 and therefore the matrix occurring in the riemann theta function is @xmath206 with @xmath205 .",
    "given our computational power , we computed @xmath181 for @xmath291 for all the needed configurations of intervals , while for @xmath290 we got results only for small intervals . in fig.[fig : ri_ex2_inset ] we show our data and some numerical extrapolations . in the whole range of @xmath184 we performed only the rational interpolation with @xmath214 ( blue line ) because only two input data are available , while for @xmath295 , where also @xmath290 is available",
    ", we could employ higher values of @xmath75 and @xmath125 .",
    "when we have more extrapolations , unfortunately they do not overlap , indicating that we can not trust these curves to give a prediction , even if they are quite close . another indication that @xmath290 is not enough to get a precise extrapolation comes from the fact that , given the data with @xmath296 and extrapolating to @xmath178 ( orange curve in fig.[fig : ri_ex2_inset ] ) we did not recover exactly the expected values ( purple circles ) found with the analytic expressions . in the inset we focus on a configuration of three intervals corresponding to @xmath292 and",
    "show the dependence of @xmath181 on @xmath14 for various @xmath121 . while the extrapolations to @xmath124 associated to @xmath297 ( for this one only @xmath291 have been used ) , @xmath298 and @xmath299 are very close , the one corresponding to @xmath300 provides a completely different extrapolation to @xmath124 .",
    "considering the two poles of the interpolating function in the regime of @xmath184 where also @xmath290 is available , we find that they are real and at least one of them is inside the domain @xmath301 .",
    "thus , the function can not be considered a good approximation of the true analytic continuation and the extrapolation can not be trusted .",
    "this behaviour does not occur for the case considered in the inset of fig.[fig : ri_ex_inset ] .",
    "thus , it is useful to plot the @xmath14 dependence of the functions obtained through the rational interpolation method in order to check the occurrence of singularities that could lead to wrong extrapolations .",
    "we find it instructive to discuss some details about the extrapolations of the logarithmic negativity of two disjoint intervals ( see  [ sec neg 2int ] ) .",
    "the simplest case we can deal with is the non compact boson and the replica limit to perform for this model is ( [ eq : ln ] ) .",
    "the analytic expression ( [ eq : ln_g ] ) contains only hypergeometric functions and therefore it can be evaluated for high values of @xmath14 .",
    "some extrapolations performed through the rational interpolation method explained above are shown in figs.[fig : rl_negall ] and [ fig : neg2 ] .",
    "the first difference between the logarithmic negativity and the mutual information in the extrapolation process is that for the former quantity we need to consider higher values of @xmath75 and @xmath125 with respect to the latter one to recover the expected result .",
    "moreover , in the regime of small intervals or large separation ( i.e. @xmath302 ) , where the logarithmic negativity falls off to zero faster than any power , it is very difficult to capture its behaviour in a clean way , despite the high values of @xmath75 and @xmath125 .",
    "in fig.[fig : neg2 ] we show some extrapolations characterized by low values of @xmath75 and @xmath125 .",
    "the most difficult regime to capture is the one with @xmath244 .",
    "thus , in fig.[fig : rl_negall ] we show some extrapolations having higher values of @xmath75 and @xmath125 . comparing the curves in these figures",
    ", one observes that with low @xmath125 s it is difficult to capture the regime of small @xmath70 , even for very high values of @xmath75 .",
    "increasing @xmath125 , the agreement slightly improves for small @xmath70 , but , as already remarked , it is more probable that the singularities of the rational interpolation fall close to the domain of the interpolated data .",
    "for example , in the case of the dashed magenta curve of fig.[fig : neg2 ] , all the poles of the rational function are real .",
    "varying the parameter @xmath70 , they move on the real axis and , whenever one of them comes close to the interpolation region @xmath258 and it is not too far from @xmath124 , the extrapolated function to @xmath124 can not be trusted as approximation of the true analytic continuation .",
    "this leads to fluctuations or singularities in the extrapolation curve as function of @xmath70 ( e.g. see also the dashed cyan curve in fig.[fig : neg2 ] and the black and magenta curves in fig.[fig : rl_negall ] ) .",
