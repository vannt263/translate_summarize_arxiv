    "modified @xmath0 gravity represents a possible alternative to einstein s theory of general relativity which has received increased attention in the last decade .",
    "it is based on a generalization of the einstein field equations that comes as a result of replacing the ricci scalar curvature , @xmath1 , with an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature , @xmath0 , in the gravitational lagrangian density .",
    "one of the main reasons for increased interest in modified gravity theories comes from the possibility of explaining accelerating expansion of the universe , that has basically been confirmed by observations from type ia supernovae @xcite , but also from other cosmological observations such as those from large scale structure @xcite , and cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "an important feature of @xmath0 gravity is that in its framework , unlike in @xmath2 cdm cosmology based on the standard general relativity , there is no need for postulating dark energy or introducing any kind of new scalar or spinor field to explain the accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "the action for @xmath0 theories is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a determinant of the metric , and @xmath6 is the matter action .",
    "depending on the assumptions taken in the variational procedure starting from ( [ akcija ] ) we can make a distinction between metric , palatini and metric - affine formalism @xcite . in metric formalism we proceed from the assumption that the connection is dependent on the metric , namely that it is given by the christoffel connection . in palatini formalism",
    "the connection is treated independent of the metric and it is also assumed that the matter part of the action is not dependent on the connection .",
    "finally , in metric - affine formalism the matter part of the action now depends on the connection which is metric independent . in this work",
    "we will use the metric approach which is the simplest of the above mentioned and also usually used in literature . using this approach and varying the action ( [ akcija ] ) with respect to the metric we obtain the following modified field equations @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 , and we will use an analogous notation for higher derivatives of @xmath0 . adopting the standard definition : @xmath10 , and after some mathematical manipulations",
    ", we can obtain a following equation for the einstein tensor from ( [ modificirana einsteinova ] )    g_= f_rr__r + f_rrr(_r)(_r ) + - ( r f_r+ f + 16 gt)+ 8 g t _ , [ einstein tensor ]    where @xmath11 is the trace of the stress - energy tensor . in this work we have analysed wormhole solutions in the framework of viable metric @xmath0 gravity models which do not violate standard energy conditions .",
    "wormholes are hypothetical tunnels with a throat that connects two asymptotically flat regions of spacetime . in einstein s general relativity , a construction of a wormhole is possible only by the use of exotic matter i.e. matter that violates usual energy conditions @xcite .",
    "the matter threading the wormhole is usually described by the perfect anisotropic fluid @xmath12 .",
    "it can be shown that existence of a wormhole in general relativity implies the condition @xmath13 and according to @xcite we shall call the material with this property exotic .",
    "this violates the weak energy condition ( wec ) , which is given by @xmath14 for any timelike vector @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the weak energy condition expresses constraints on a possible matter behaviour in order to guarantee some usual properties , such as positive energy density . on the other hand",
    ", it was reported that static spherically symmetric wormhole can be supported by a phantom energy @xcite .",
    "the general question of the wec violation in modefied gravity still remains open @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in modified gravity with the field equations of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an additional geometrical structure , @xmath18 multiplicative factors , and @xmath19 curvature invariants of gravitational field , normal matter threading the wormhole can satisfy the wec if it fulfils following relationship @xmath20 in modified @xmath0 theories of gravity , wormholes can be supported by ordinary matter @xcite . therefore , while interested in wec non - violation we are exploring solutions that satisfy @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "our aim is to analyse , without any additional assumptions , possible wormhole solutions in different viable recently proposed @xmath0 models that do not imply the existence of exotic material . in section 2 .",
    "we present wormhole geometry , effective field equations and derive suitable expressions for the wec non violation near the throat . in section 3 .",
    "we present and analyse some specific solutions in different models .",
    "high curvature regime is considered in section 4 . and",
    "we make conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the geometry of a static , spherical symmetric wormhole is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the redshift function and @xmath25 is a shape function @xcite .",
    "functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate @xmath26 , which nonmonotonically decreases from infinity to a minimal value @xmath27 in the throat and increases to infinity . for the throat position",
    "@xmath28 the metric tensor component is singular .",
    "nevertheless , the proper distance must be well behaved , from which the following integral must be real and regular outside the throat @xcite : @xmath29 from which follows the condition : @xmath30 so , far from the throat in both radial directions space must be asymptotically flat which implies the condition @xmath31 as @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental wormhole properties is that by definition @xmath25 must fulfil the flaring - out condition at or near the throat : @xmath33 @xcite , where @xmath34 , ( in further text prime denotes a derivative with respect to the argument of a function ) .",
    "the second condition which we impose is practical : we demand that a wormhole must be traversable which means the absence of horizons .",
    "so @xmath24 must be finite everywhere . using standard mathematical procedure from ( [ metrika ] ) we obtain the ricci curvature scalar :    r=-[((r)r^2 + 2(r)^2r^2)(1- ) - ( b(r)r - b(r ) ) -(r)^2r^2(1- ) + 2(r)r(1-)- r(-)- ] .",
    "[ ricci ]    while studying wormholes in @xmath0 modified theories of gravity , in order to simplify equations , it is common to place an additional condition on red - shift function @xmath24 to be constant @xcite .",
    "this condition on @xmath24 , which is assumed without any physical reason , is not justified because the fundamental parameters of a wormhole should not be restricted in such an artificial way . moreover ,",
    "wormhole solutions of modified einstein s equations and the wec violation will in some cases critically depend on @xmath24 .",
    "matter is described by the stress - energy tensor of the anisotropic perfect fluid : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a four - velocity , @xmath37 the energy density , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are transversal and radial pressure respectively , and @xmath40 . in ( [ akcija ] )",
    "we select @xmath41 for simplicity , and from ( [ einstein tensor ] ) we obtain modified einstein s equations for the wormhole geometry    = - f_rr(1- ) r(r)(r)+(r(r)f_r + f ) + + ( 2 + 2p_t + p_r ) , [ prva ]    f_r = f_rr [ r(r)(1- ) + ( - ) ] + f_rrrr(r)^2(1- ) - ( r(r)f_r+f ) + + ( + 2p_r - 2p_t ) ,    ( 1-)((r ) - (r ) + (r)^2 + -)f_r = ( 1-)r(r ) - ( r(r)f_r+f)+ ( - p_r + p_t ) .",
    "[ treca ]    note that field equations ( [ prva ] - [ treca ] ) are forth order nonlinear differential equations in @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "however , equations ( [ prva ] - [ treca ] ) at the same time represent the system of algebraic equations for the stress - energy tensor components that , despite it s complexity , have analytic solutions . in our work in specific models of modified @xmath0 gravity we consider solutions for the components of the stress - energy tensor by exploring different redshift , @xmath24 , and shape functions , @xmath25 . from field equations ( [ prva ] - [ treca ] ) we can derive a specific form of the wec for wormhole solutions in @xmath0 gravity    = 0 , [ wec1 ]    + p_r= 0 .",
    "[ wec2 ]    + p_t= 0 .",
    "[ wec3 ]    we require that the matter threading the wormhole satisfies wec , so we demand that inequalities ( [ wec1]),([wec2 ] ) and ( [ wec3 ] ) are fulfilled .",
    "since in einstein s general relativity , which corresponds to @xmath42 , this is not possible , higher curvature terms in the action support wormhole geometries .",
    "we can see that explicit analysis of the equations ( [ wec1]),([wec2 ] ) and ( [ wec3 ] ) is extremely difficult , and that for a specific wormhole geometry wec violation can critically depend on the redshift functions @xmath24 and its derivatives . as an important and interesting case we can consider the equations ( [ wec2 ] ) and ( [ wec3 ] ) near the throat",
    "this approach simplifies the problem considerably .",

    "it is obvious that this condition can not be fulfilled for every choice of @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , if we take @xmath42 this condition is not satisfied and this corresponds to the need for exotic matter in einstein s relativity . as we will show in the later part of our work , for analysed models we typically have @xmath48 near the throat , and from ( [ pavsosspt ] ) we obtain the condition @xmath49",
    "if @xmath24 is taken to be differentiable and continuous function on the interval @xmath50 and @xmath51 continuous on the same interval , then according to gronwall - bellman inequality we have @xmath52 from this expression we can see the importance of @xmath24 : for a given red - shift function we can solve the integral ( [ integral ] ) and determine the function that bounds @xmath25 near the throat . taking this bounding function as a critical case we can determine ricci scalar and check whether ( [ pavsosspr ] ) is satisfied in the concrete @xmath0 model .",
    "let us consider a specific example @xmath53 for simplicity .",
    "bounding shape function is then @xmath54 then , calculating the ricci scalar and its derivative , from ( [ pavsosspr ] ) we obtain the condition : @xmath55 which depends only on a specific @xmath0 model when the constants @xmath56 and @xmath27 are given .",
    "+ in the next section our approach will be to find specific solutions of equations ( [ prva ] - [ treca ] ) for a given wormhole geometry and then check whether the wec is satisfied or not , rather than analyse equations ( [ wec1 ] ) , ( [ wec2 ] ) and ( [ wec3 ] ) .",
    "we will focus on the question of condition @xmath57 violation for the specific @xmath0 models , since it is this part of the wec that is necessary violated near the throat in the einstein s general theory of relativity , and was used as a definition for exotic matter in @xcite . for the simple choices of @xmath25 and @xmath24 in the considered models , @xmath58 is typically violated somewhere away from the throat , as shown in the fig .",
    "[ wec3zasve ] for all models .",
    "this should not be of primary concern , since it is the throat connecting two asymptotically flat regions that is of the main interest , and one can always cut - off the solution at some @xmath59 away from the throat and connect it with other asymptotically flat solution of modified einstein s equations in that region .",
    "this would physically correspond to a wormhole in a spacetime in which another energy - momentum distribution starts to dominate for @xmath60 .",

    "<S> in this work wormholes in viable @xmath0 gravity models are analysed . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in exact solutions for stress - energy tensor components depending on different shape and redshift functions . </S>",
    "<S> several solutions of gravitational equations for different @xmath0 models are examined . </S>",
    "<S> found solutions imply no need for exotic material , while this need is implied in the standard general theory of relativity . </S>",
    "<S> a simple expression for wec violation near the throat is derived and analysed . </S>",
    "<S> high curvature regime is also discussed , as well as the question of the highest possible values of the ricci scalar for which the wec is not violated near the throat , and corresponding functions are calculated for several models . </S>",
    "<S> the approach here differs from the one that has been common since no additional assumptions to simplify the equations have been made , and functions in @xmath0 models are not considered to be arbitrary functions , but rather a feature of the theory that has to be evaluated on the basis of consistency with observations for the solar system and cosmological evolution . therefore in this work </S>",
    "<S> we show that existence of wormholes without exotic matter is not only possible in simple arbitrary @xmath0 models , but also in models that are in accordance with empirical data . </S>"
