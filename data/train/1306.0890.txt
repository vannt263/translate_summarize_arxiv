    "for the second part of the statement , the qc condition is equivalent to @xmath162 for an appropriately chosen section @xmath155 .",
    "a recurring phenomenon in the study of @xmath11-structures is that the intrinsic torsion is determined by the exterior derivative of some invariant forms .",
    "the structure group @xmath15 has no invariant forms ; there is , however , an invariant _ vector - bundle - valued _ differential form whose exterior covariant derivative determines the intrinsic torsion .",
    "this relation is best expressed in the language of tensorial forms ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "if @xmath166 is a tensorial @xmath185-form , then @xmath186    the structure group @xmath15 fixes a tensor @xmath187 where we have set @xmath188 .",
    "accordingly , on a @xmath15-structure @xmath150 the associated tensorial @xmath3-form @xmath189 is @xmath15-invariant , hence parallel .",
    "[ prop : dsigma22 ] fix a connection on a @xmath15-structure @xmath150 .",

    "it is now straightforward to verify that @xmath201 coincides with the projection to @xmath202 of the torsion @xmath203 .",
    "this link between intrinsic torsion and tensorial forms is a recurrent feature of qc geometry ; it will be used in sections  [ sec : integrability ] and [ sec : kintrinsictorsion ] to prove vanishing conditions on the intrinsic torsion via the bianchi identity .",
    "in this section we recall three explicit examples of qc structures , which will be used in the rest of the paper for reference .",
    "they can be seen as the `` space forms '' of qc geometry , corresponding to the case of positive , negative and zero scalar curvature .    consider the sphere as a homogeneous space @xmath204 , where @xmath205 the lie algebra of @xmath11 is @xmath206 and @xmath207 is defined by @xmath208 , @xmath209 .",

    "it has torsion @xmath226 and curvature zero .",
    "a common feature of these examples is the presence of a natural connection , which will play a rle in section  [ sec : posit ] .",

    "<S> this paper uses the language of special geometries : namely , of @xmath11-structures whose intrinsic torsion is partially prescribed . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic torsion of a @xmath11-structure is a tensor representing the first order obstruction to its flatness ; it is obtained from the torsion of any connection via a projection to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is induced by the inclusion @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> a qc structure can not be flat in the sense of @xmath11-structures , for this would make the distribution integrable in the sense of the frobenius theorem ; the type of condition that we will consider is that the intrinsic torsion take values in a fixed @xmath11-invariant subspace of @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding what the group @xmath11 should be is one of the goals of this paper . as a first step , </S>",
    "<S> letting @xmath15 be the stabilizer of a point in the grassmannian of @xmath5-planes in @xmath16 , we show that a qc distribution consists in a @xmath15-structure with intrinsic torsion taking values in the orbit @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a distinguished element in @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that we are dealing with a single @xmath15-orbit suggests that a qc @xmath15-structure has a canonical reduction , determined by the intrinsic torsion itself . </S>",
    "<S> we are led to consider a smaller structure group @xmath20 , namely the stabilizer in @xmath15 of @xmath18 , obtaining a notion of qc @xmath20-structure .    </S>",
    "<S> the definition gives obvious constraints on the intrinsic torsion of a qc @xmath20-structure , which we refine using the bianchi identity and a calculation involving certain equivariant linear maps . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a qc @xmath20-structure takes values in @xmath21 when @xmath9 ; if @xmath10 , this is only true up to a @xmath22-dimensional , irreducible representation of @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath24 in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the course of the paper we prove that this component of the intrinsic torsion is zero if and only if the structure is integrable in the sense of @xcite ( an empty condition for @xmath9 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> restricting now to the integrable case , we can repeat the argument and further reduce the structure group to the stabilizer of @xmath25 , which has the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the canonical representation of @xmath1 considered in quaternionic geometry , acting as a subgroup of @xmath28 . using the bianchi identity again , we prove that the intrinsic torsion of an integrable qc @xmath0-structure is constant . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding @xmath0-orbit of @xmath29 contains a single point , and we can not repeat the usual procedure . we take this as evidence of the fact that @xmath0 is the `` natural '' structure group of qc geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that a @xmath0-structure does not involve either the choice of a metric on the qc distribution nor of a complement .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the intrinsic torsion is constant suggests that there could be a canonical connection with constant torsion , obtained by inverting the map @xmath30 this can not be done for two reasons : @xmath31 is not injective , so the torsion condition does not define a unique connection , and secondly @xmath0 is not reductive , so @xmath31 does not even have a @xmath0-equivariant right inverse . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we are able to show that a canonical connection exists on any @xmath1-reduction of a qc @xmath0-structure ; it is characterized by having constant torsion and satisfying natural conditions on the curvature . </S>",
    "<S> it will be called the qc connection .    </S>",
    "<S> the torsion condition gives strong restrictions on the curvature via the bianchi identity . </S>",
    "<S> a long computation with highest weight vectors allows us to compute the space in which the curvature takes values . </S>",
    "<S> this curvature is a stronger invariant than the qc conformal curvature tensor introduced in @xcite , since it obstructs the existence of a local diffeomorphism with the heisenberg group that preserves not only the qc distribution , but also the choice of a complement .    in the last part of the paper , we consider integrable qc structures with a fixed compatible metric on the associated distribution . </S>",
    "<S> these can be characterized as @xmath2-structures satisfying an intrinsic torsion condition ; we refer to them as quaternionic - contact metric ( qcm ) structures .    </S>",
    "<S> the qc connection has a metric analogue that we call the qcm connection ; the two are related via a projection , and the results on the curvature of the former carry over to the latter . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the curvature is entirely determined by the intrinsic torsion and its covariant derivative , except for the component @xmath32 , which correponds to the curvature space of hyperkhler manifolds of dimension @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a new proof of a result of @xcite , relating closedness of the fundamental four - form to the vanishing of the traceless ricci tensor for @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that the intrinsic torsion of a qcm structure consists of three components : one is a symmetric tensor which can be identified with the ricci tensor , one obstructs the integrability of the complement ( or `` vertical '' distribution ) , and one is trivial , determined by the definitions .    </S>",
    "<S> comparing our results with the literature , we recover the existence of both the biquard and duchemin connection on integrable qcm manifolds of arbitrary dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the `` horizontal '' part of the curvature of the biquard connection is determined linearly by the qcm curvature and torsion ; this indicates that formulae using this part of the curvature can be equally expressed in terms of the qcm curvature . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we prove that the ricci tensor of the biquard connection can also be identified with the symmetric part of the intrinsic torsion . </S>"
