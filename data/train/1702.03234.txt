    "stored energy based physical bounds for arbitrarily shaped small antennas provide interesting and useful information about antenna design possibilities  @xcite .",
    "they set the outer boundaries of what is possible .",
    "such information is helpful before starting the non - linear and complex process of designing antennas and as a benchmark on the antenna performance .",
    "the stored energy of an antenna determines the q - factor which is closely related to the fractional impedance bandwidth performance of the antenna  @xcite . to determine practical q - factor bounds it is essential to also include the key desired constraints on the antenna design parameters .",
    "such constraints can be on the far - field , tuning , front - to - back ratio , gain , directivity requirements and tolerances on design and/or feeding amplitude and phase .    however , only a small fraction of these and other constraints results in a convex optimization problem  @xcite . in this paper we show that the we can formulate lower bounds on the q - factor for a total directivity in a given direction as a relaxed convex optimization problem .",
    "indeed a class of the non - convex constraint to q - factor bounds can be relaxed into a convex problem .",
    "the relation between the antenna size and its maximal directivity has frequently been investigated , and it is known that any directivity can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "harrington  @xcite used @xmath0 spherical - modes to derive a limit for directivity as a function of size and geyi  @xcite used q - factors for spheres to obtain another limit for the directivity as function of the radius of an enclosing sphere . beyond those spherical - shape based size - limitations , it is also well known that one can obtain bounds on the q - factor for an arbitrary shaped antenna , for a given partial directivity  @xcite .",
    "however the extension of this latter bound to the total directivity results is a non - convex problem , and has thus been difficult to determine .",
    "it is therefore very interesting that the semi - definite relaxation methods  @xcite enables us to obtain lower bounds on the q - factor for this class of problems .",
    "indeed this technique also allows us also to introduce other interesting non - convex constraints , like tuning and losses . a bound in  @xcite",
    "determines the lowest possible q - factor for a given _ partial _ directivity in a given direction .",
    "this work is in the same direction : find the lowest possible q - factor bound for a given _ total _ directivity , in a desired direction .",
    "it rests on the observations  @xcite that any directivity is theoretically possible given a sufficiently high @xmath1-factor .",
    "high enough q - factors make such antenna design solutions difficult to realize and to measure  @xcite , it s thus more practically interesting to determine trade - offs between high directivity and as low as possible q - factor .",
    "earlier efforts in this direction has also been considered by _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite in different contexts .",
    "we illustrate this type of lower q - bounds for two types of shapes , and compare the results with a full - wave simulated highly - directive antenna .",
    "an overview of small antennas with high directivity can be found in  @xcite .",
    "there are advantages if the investigated optimization problem can be formulated as a convex problem : such problems have a unique minimum , furthermore there are fast numerical methods to find both the minimum and minimizer see _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite .",
    "these methods are so effective that sometimes the problem is considered ` solved ' as soon as it has a convex formulation .",
    "this is not quite that straightly forward for antenna designs , but knowing bounds on the q - factor certainly helps in defining antenna performance goals .    if the investigated constraint to the q - factor optimization makes the problem non - convex , it is in general much harder to solve the problem .",
    "tools like tracing multiple lagrange parameters over some sub - domain genetic algorithms and exhaustive searchers are in general considerably slower and the problem might not have a unique minimum . in the case of q - factor bounds",
    "we find that almost all constraints on the antenna parameters are linear or quadratic in the current density .",
    "this class of optimization problem is called quadratically constrained quadratic program ( qcqp ) .",
    "it is known that this class includes np - hard problems see _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite , and that this problem is in general not convex .",
    "successful convex methods to estimate a lower bound for the minimum of a qcqp problem are the semi - definite relaxation method ( sdr )  @xcite and the reformulation - linearization technique see _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "sdr , which is utilized in this paper , has recently been used to solve several interesting problems , ranging from beamforming in communication networks , optimal power in power systems , to phase - reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "sdr converts a qcqp - problem to a semi - definite programming problem see _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite .",
    "the idea rests on a trace - operator identity that helps to reformulate the original problem into a linear relaxed problem .",
    "the original problem is thus formulated into an optimization of the trace of matrix products , usually also with constraints in terms of traces .",
    "trace - based methods provide a powerful tool to rewrite large classes of optimization problems .",
    "it has been shown that a class of data mining and machine learning problems can be formulated as trace - optimization problems in order to extract a set of small dimension out of a very large data sets see _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite .",
    "this latter type of trace - optimization problems tends to be quadratic in their unknown , as a difference to the sdr problems investigated here .",
    "but it is interesting to observe how the trace is utilized to obtain a low - dimensional solution in both cases .",
    "the numerical implementation of the relaxed problem gives a lower bound to the qcqp .",
    "the question naturally arises under what circumstances that the minimizer of the relaxed problem also solves the original numerical problem , for an overview of the distance between solutions to the sdr and to the original problem see  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "one result shown in this paper is that the relaxed q - factor bound for the total directivity in a given direction is tight .",
    "that is the solution to the relaxed problems for small antennas give the minimum to the original problem .",
    "this is also illustrated by comparison with a non - linear solver which is also described in the paper .",
    "the rest of this paper consists of five sections .",
    "section ii defines the q - factor and certain key antenna parameters .",
    "section iii formulates the minimization problems for the q - factor with different directivity constraints and the use of the sdr technique .",
    "section iv introduces a non - linear eigenvalue based method to estimate the minimum q - factor , and section v illustrates a few numerical examples , in which lower bounds on the q - factor for the different methods are investigated .",
    "comparison with a simulated high - directivity antenna is also illustrated .",
    "section vi concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we introduce the well known terms of directivity , gain and q - factor for antennas see _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite .",
    "the aim is to precisely define the optimization problems that we study in the next section .",
    "consider an antenna of finite extent placed in free space at the origin of our coordinate system .",
    "the antenna far - field radiation intensity @xmath2 varies with the unit - direction @xmath3 as seen from the center of the antenna .",
    "the total radiated power @xmath4 of the antenna is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the unit sphere in @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 and where we let @xmath10 be the polar angle and @xmath11 is the azimuth angle . here",
    "@xmath12 is the free space impedance .",
    "given the currents densities on the antenna , we can directly determine its electric field , @xmath13 , and hence its radiated power .",
    "here , @xmath14 , is a vector in @xmath7 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "it is often convenient to express the radiation intensity in terms of the far - field @xmath17 where @xmath18 as @xmath19 .",
    "we have that @xmath20 .",
    "the total directivity , @xmath21 , of an antenna is defined as the ratio of the radiation intensity in the direction @xmath3 to the average radiation intensity , @xmath22 , over the sphere , _ i.e. _ , @xmath23 and the peak total directivity is @xmath24 .    the gain , @xmath25 , of an antenna accounts also for the efficiency @xmath26 , in the antenna where @xmath27 is the input power to the antenna .",
    "the gain is defined as @xmath28 the partial gain , and the partial directivity are related to the directivity of a given polarization of the radiated field .",
    "that is consider a polarization - direction , @xmath29 , orthogonal to the direction of observation direction @xmath3 , then the partial directivity ( partial - gain ) is the radiation intensity in that polarization of the field _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath30 to the average radiated power ( input power ) . in the present paper",
    "we consider only loss - less antennas , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath31 , where gain and directivity are equal , the reason for this limitation is that we are concerned here mainly with antennas of metal with very low losses .",
    "indeed lossy antennas tend to have a larger bandwidth , and less radiated power due to the presence of ohmic losses in the materials .",
    "thus it is a tougher problem to obtain a large bandwidth in the loss - less case .    an interesting class of antennas",
    "are superdirective antennas see _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that infinite directivity is possible  @xcite .",
    "superdirectivity , is somewhat vaguely defined as antennas with above normal directivity .",
    "however , since the directivity is unbounded it is essential to compare at what cost the directivity comes .",
    "the essential feature investigated here is bandwidth , since size does not necessarily limit large directivity .",
    "however , a small size does limit the @xmath1-factor , making it more expensive in in terms of bandwidth to increase the directivity .",
    "small antenna designs tend to have a low directivity .",
    "however , a higher directivity can be obtained at the expense of antenna bandwidth .",
    "an advantage with small antennas , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  antennas with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the wave number and @xmath34 is the radius of a sphere that circumscribe the antenna , are that the q - factor gives an implicit way to define their relative bandwidth  @xcite .",
    "the fractional ( or relative ) bandwidth @xmath35 for a single resonance circuit is related to the q - factor through the relation  @xcite near a single resonance : @xmath36 where the center frequency @xmath37 and the magnitude of the maximally allowed reflection coefficient is @xmath38 . when the input impedance of the antenna @xmath39 is known one often define the impedance @xmath1-factor through the relation  @xcite @xmath40 a comparison between bandwidth and q - factors for different definitions are given in  @xcite .",
    "the definition of the lower q - bound for a loss - less antenna is defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the current density on the antenna . here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the stored electric and the stored magnetic energy , defined below . even for small antennas",
    "it is known that the q - factor is not a perfect prediction of the fractional bandwidth , see  @xcite , in which there is also comparisons between @xmath1 and @xmath45 and their relation to the relative bandwidth .",
    "however , for q - factors larger than @xmath46 there is a fairly good correlation between high @xmath1 ( @xmath45 ) and the fraction bandwidth for small antennas .",
    "stored energies for antennas have been discussed throughly in the literature , see _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite .",
    "here we use the definition : @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 this definition is valid for antennas without magnetic material .",
    "stored energy for antennas with magnetic materials are investigated in  @xcite .",
    "we have furthermore made the simplification that the current densities @xmath42 are surface current densities .",
    "here we use the notation @xmath51 , @xmath52 and similarly for @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the free space permeability .",
    "the surface @xmath55 is the surface of the antenna structure , or a surface that enclose the structure .",
    "we note that the q - factor in   depends on the set of allowed current densities .",
    "if we make the space of allowed currents larger , by _",
    "e.g. _ ,  increasing the support of current densities we find a lower q - factor .",
    "thus a shape that enclose an antenna have a lower q - factor bound .    the stored energies and the radiated power as well as the power intensity are determined numerically utilizing a method of moment ( mom ) approach .",
    "note that the stored energies are very similar to the components of the electric field integral equations , and it is thus easy to extract them from a mom code .",
    "the in - house mom - code is based on the rao - wilton - glisson ( rwg ) basis functions and use a 10:th order gauss quadrature  @xcite to determine the impedance matrix and decdem as described in  @xcite and references therein , for the singular terms .",
    "utilizing the mom - finite dimensional approximation of the electric field integral equations , we find that the electric stored energy can be expressed as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a finite @xmath58-matrix acting upon the current density coefficient vector @xmath59 , we also have @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , the radiated field is approximated by @xmath61 .",
    "here we use the notation @xmath62 as the inner product between two vectors with @xmath0-elements .",
    "the electric far - field @xmath17 in a given polarization @xmath29 and @xmath3 is approximated through @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a vector . in the excellent tutorial",
    "@xcite one can find a discussion on both matrix formulations of key antenna terms as well as its application to convex optimization .",
    "in this section we formulate three different minimization problems towards the goal to determine a lower bound on the q - factor for a given directivity - constraint .",
    "lets start with the bounds on the q - factor for a given partial directivity . in",
    "@xcite they formulated a @xmath65-bound for superdirectivity , utilizing the observation that @xmath66 the maximum of the @xmath65 problem at @xmath67 can be reformulated as a convex minimization problem  @xcite : @xmath68 we refer to as to find the q - factor for a given _ partial _",

    "naturally gives @xmath1 at a given @xmath72 .",
    "observe that the minimization reformulation of the problem does not state that we have obtained the peak partial directivity in the given direction @xmath3 , only that the directivity in the desired direction is larger than @xmath73 .",
    "the ingenious idea in  @xcite to formulate q - factor bounds with a given partial directivity is easily solvable with cvx  @xcite or another convex - optimization solver given the respective matrices @xmath74 and @xmath75 together with the far - field vector @xmath76 . the results yields both a minimizing current on the structure , as well as the unique minimum of the problem , see _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite .    if we instead want to formulate bounds on the q - factor for the total directivity in the direction @xmath3 , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xmath77 for @xmath78 , we need to include both polarizations of the far - field _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xmath29 , @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath80 forms a right - hand triple at each observation direction @xmath3 .",
    "we note that @xmath81 .",
    "lets introduce the matrix @xmath82 which is related to the radiation intensity through @xmath83 .",
    "the approximation is as usual due to that we have only a finite number of rwg - basis functions in the representation of @xmath2 .    given the matrix @xmath84 in  , we find that the total directivity can hence be estimated through @xmath85 note that the optimization problem @xmath77 given the total directivity @xmath86 is scaling invariant in the amplitude of the current density .",
    "the numerical approximation of this minimization problem can hence be formulated as the following non - convex problem @xmath87 we refere to the problem   as to find q for a given _ total _",
    "directivity @xmath88 .",
    "clearly , given a solution current @xmath89 , we find the @xmath90 as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the solution to the lower q - bounds in the respective case of and , since it is not always easy to predict which polarization that gives the lowest q - factor .",
    "it depends both on the shape of the object , but also on the desired observation direction , see _",
    "e.g. _ ,  fig  [ fig1 ] in next section .",
    "the information that there are possible currents that provide a lower q - factor if we relax our demand on the polarization is important , since the possibility of such currents that radiate part or all of its power in another polarization - direction will affect the antenna design .",
    "if polarization purity is important , then design measures to suppress the unwanted polarization may be required .",
    "however in _",
    "e.g. _ ,  harvesting applications it is an advantage if multiple polarizations are absorbed by the antenna .",
    "thus the cross - polarization levels are often an important factor in antenna designs .",
    "the minimization problem given in   is non - convex , and has to the authors knowledge not been formulated as a convex optimization problem in the literature . observe that this optimization problem fall in the category of quadratically constrained quadratic optimization programs ( qcqp ) . beyond linear programming ,",
    "quadratic programming is a rather well investigated class of optimization problems .",
    "qcqp - type problems are often occurring in physics applications where _",
    "e.g. _ ,  energies are quadratic forms in terms of sources .",
    "there are several different methods to solve  , either directly with a non - linear or heuristic solver or through a relaxation method . a powerful method to relax qcqp into convex problems",
    "is the semi - definite relaxation method , sdr . to derive the relaxed problem",
    "we follow the sdr - technique and observe that @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a rank 1 matrix and @xmath94 is the trace of the matrix @xmath95 . with this observation we can now formulate the optimization problem for the lower q - bound given a total directivity in the @xmath3-direction as @xmath96 where we have dropped , relaxed , the @xmath97 condition in order to make the problem convex .",
    "the problem falls in the class of semi - definite programming , and there are efficient methods to solve rather large such problems see _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite .",
    "the problem stated in   is the relaxed problem in finding the lowest q - factor for a _ total _ directivity .",
    "if we compare these different minimization problems for bounds the q - factor we note that both and are convex and hence each has a unique minimum .",
    "however   has a much larger set of unknowns in its @xmath58-matrix @xmath95 that is hermitian positive semi - definite , as compared with , the @xmath0-vector of @xmath59 .",
    "we thus tend to obtain rather large size minimization problems for  . the relaxed problem will always be a lower bound to the original problem .",
    "in fact , in our case we have a stronger statement , which is that is tight and predicts the solution to   in all cases .",
    "this fact is outlined in next subsection .",
    "we also observe that a numerically calculated solution @xmath98 might not be a rank one matrix .",
    "there are however several methods to extract feasible rank one solutions , see _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite .    above",
    "we have focused on the total directivity .",
    "we note in passing that several other desirable constraints like antenna tuning _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xmath99 , losses , and other far - field constraints also can be formulated as relaxed convex problems since they all fall in the category of quadratically constrained quadratic programming .",
    "see also  @xcite .",
    "a feature of the sdr technique is that the relaxed problem gives a rather tight approximation of the originally investigated problem see _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite . indeed under some circumstances it determines the minimum to the original solution .    to show that is tight",
    ", we observe that @xmath77 for @xmath86 is equivalent to @xmath100 for @xmath101 , when the latter problem is feasible .",
    "if we express this latter maximization problem in terms of the matrices , once again using the scaling invariance , we find that it can be written as : @xmath102 we have thus established that solving   is equivalent to solving if the solution is feasible . note that there is a minimal @xmath1-factor , @xmath103 associated with a bounded structure . in  @xcite it was shown that @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the maximal eigenvalue of the electric polarizability matrix , in our case .",
    "thus , for @xmath106 there is a solution to the above problem .",

    "thus   has four constraints , resulting in that  @xcite predict @xmath111 for its solutions .",
    "it is therefor benificial to rewrite it into a problem for @xmath112 as given above . ] and from a theorem in  @xcite we deduce that there are minimizers @xmath98 such that @xmath113 .",
    "note that the result in  @xcite does not say that all solutions to   have rank 1 , only that there are such solutions if the problem is feasible .",
    "following the argumentation in the proof of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  5 )",
    "we note that since @xmath113 there is an @xmath89 such that @xmath114 , and this is the optimal current density solution to  , since is always a upper bound to  .    since the problems   and are equivalent for @xmath106 , we have that both problems are tight .",
    "that is , the minimum of is also the minimum of  .",
    "in this section we introduce an alternative method to determine the lower bounds on the q - factor for a total directivity  .",
    "we use this latter method to illustrate that the solution to the relaxed problem   predict the solution to the original problem  .",
    "we also use this method to solve problems where the memory demands of solution methods to   become too large . the method derived here have some similarities with the method given in  @xcite .",

    "[ fig2 ] . ]      in our second example , we consider two rectangular plates of 32 mm @xmath138 44 mm , parallel to the xy - plane and with a distance between them of 40 mm along the z - axis , see fig .",

    "the optimization problem is solved for a range of different directions @xmath135 .",
    "the polar angle @xmath10 is chosen in the range @xmath136 $ ] , and the azimuthal angle is @xmath157 .",
    "we use @xmath139 mhz if not otherwise stated .",
    "the directional constraints in the optimization is not equivalent with that the peak directivity is in that direction , as mentioned above . to illustrate this we utilize the convex minimization in   at the lowest possible @xmath158 for the @xmath135 angles @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "the radiation pattern in the @xmath160-plane with a @xmath161-polarized field correspond to the lowest q - value for each of these angles are depicted in red in fig .",
    "the radiation patterns marked with a blue line with dots corresponds to the same @xmath10-angles , but now at directivity @xmath162 dbi . the realized radiation pattern at the two intermediate angles do not have their peak directivity at the aimed for angles of @xmath163 and @xmath164 respectively .",
    "we note that the optimization does not require that the peak directivity is in the direction of @xmath3 .",
    "however , as the directivity becomes larger , we see that the main peak - direction approaches the desired angle .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ rad]b , and  [ rad]c , where the peak of the blue line moves towards the goal @xmath3-direction .",
    "above correspond to a @xmath135-goal direction of @xmath165 $ ] , @xmath157 . the red line above corresponds to the lowest @xmath158-value possible  , that is points along the green line in fig .",
    "the blue lines , with dots are radiation patterns with @xmath166 dbi for the same desired @xmath3-directions . ]    in fig .",
    "[ rad]b , at the lowest @xmath1-value ( the red curve ) we find that the peak radiation direction is @xmath167 , instead of the expected @xmath163 .",
    "our interpretation of this solution to the minimization problem   is that the current minimizer consists mainly of a current with low - q radiation at @xmath168 perturbed by a current that ensures that the direction @xmath163 has large enough far - field amplitude .",
    "these currents are scaled relative to each other in such a way so that the constraints in   are satisfied .",
    "the interpretation is hence that it is more costly in q - factor ( smaller bandwidth ) to have the peak directivity at @xmath163 than it is to scale up a slightly perturbed radiation pattern with peak directivity at @xmath168 sufficiently much to satisfy the constraint @xmath169 resulting in a peak radiation direction at @xmath167 . by increasing the demands on @xmath88",
    "to @xmath162 dbi we find that the @xmath1-factor also increases , see fig .",
    "this ensures that it costs more in q - factor to use a peak directivity in another direction , since high directivity amounts to less radiation in non - peak directions .",
    "this is also indicated with the blue line in fig .",
    "[ rad]b where the peak direction moves more towards @xmath163 .",
    "we see the same phenomena for a desired peak direction at @xmath164 in fig .",

    "it also defines the dark - red envelope at the bottom of the figure corresponding to the lowest @xmath1 sweeping @xmath175 $ ] .",
    "the green - hue colors corresponds to the envelope of the lowest @xmath1-values from the partial directivity optimization for frequencies [ 0.88 , 0.89 , 0.9 ] ghz .",
    "the line marked parasitic corresponds to a parasitic element antenna , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . ]",
    "the lower bounds on q for a given partial directivity   are depicted in blueish colors in fig .",
    "the smallest in q - factor envelope over all   optimizations upon sweeping over the desired observation direction @xmath10 is shown in green .",
    "the green lines consists of the frequencies @xmath176 $ ] ghz . due to the @xmath156-normalization of the @xmath1-factor in",
    "we find that they essentially are coinciding , showing that the electric polarization is essential in determining these @xmath1-bounds  @xcite .    the red envelope in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the smallest @xmath1 in solving using the generalized eigenvalue method . for q - values that is larger than the green line",
    ", we have that the lowest @xmath1-value for   and agree for the considered range , as illustrated with @xmath174-case .",
    "the mesh used in this case is the same as the mesh for one rectangle , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath173 for each rectangle .    to investigate the stability of the solutions with respect to increasing the mesh size we also have used @xmath177 , with only a few points that are inserted below and almost coinciding with the line for @xmath147 up in the right corner of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( light blue ) .",
    "comparing and with solutions to the trace - optimization   is harder in this case .",
    "solutions with @xmath178 and @xmath179 fill the region between the red and the green line , with small perturbations , as illustrated with the @xmath170 for @xmath171 . to illustrate a bit of the challenge in solving the @xmath173-case with cvx , we find that the sedumi solver converts and solves the problem of size dimension @xmath180 for the @xmath181-case , whereas the @xmath173 correspond to a problem of size @xmath182 .",
    "this rapid growth limits the size of the investigated problems .",
    "however we note that a comparison between the speed of the trace - optimization and the non - linear eigenvalue search shows that the trace - method is faster .",
    "thus given sufficient memory , trace - optimization is an attractive method .",
    "we once again observe that the trace - bounds on @xmath1 is tight , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are also solutions to .",
    "another phenomena that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is that the lowest possible @xmath1-factor for a particular directivity is not necessarily one with radiation in a cardinal direction .",
    "note that at @xmath183 dbi we see that the curve marked @xmath168 has a higher q - value than the curves marked @xmath174 and @xmath164 . in  fig .",
    "[ rad]c we have that the blue line have its peak directivity at @xmath184 . similarly the blue radiation pattern with @xmath162 dbi in fig .",
    "[ rad]d has its peak at @xmath168 .",
    "thus , an interpretation is that as we solve the minimization problem with higher requirement on the directivity , we find current minimizers also with non - cardinal peak radiation direction with a lower q - factor than currents that radiate in the cardinal direction .",
    "it is nice to see how this process still smoothly trace out the lower - q envelope as a function of @xmath158 given by the low - q red line in fig .",
    "in essence , we find that depicted curve furthermost to the right ( red ) is a description of the lowest q - factor increase with demands on directivity . the red line thus describe the smallest cost in q - factor for a desired ( super)directivity .        in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we have also included a lilac curve marked ` parasitic ' that corresponds to a full - wave simulation over a frequency interval close to the resonance of a high - directivity parasitic element antenna of the shape shown in fig  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the shape fits into the investigated double - rectangle structure .",
    "it is composed with a driven element ( lower plate ) and a parasitic element ( upper plate ) .",
    "it is closely related to a realized and measured antenna , discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we see that the lowest point of the parasitic curve at the frequency 892 mhz comes rather close to the low green  -case _ e.g. _ ,  it has a fairly high directivity , while keeping the q - factor low . if it is possible to realize antennas on the green - curve , or even better closer the red marked lower q - factor envelope in   is still an open question .",
    "we show that semi - definite relaxation can be used to determine the q - factor for a given total directivity .",
    "we have shown that it often agrees with the q - bounds for a given _ partial _ directivity . however , in both the illustrated cases we also note that there are situations with lower q - factors than predicted by the earlier method if we allow for both polarizations .",
    "the reason that we use the lowest q - factor to bound ( super)directivity is that size does not necessarily limit the directivity .",
    "however , as we have illustrated , given a desired q - factor , there is a limited maximal directivity .",
    "thus by connecting directivity to its maximally allowed q - factor for a given shape , we find an approximation to the widest bandwidth associated with a desired total directivity .",
    "another result shown in the paper is that the semi - definite relaxation method give tight bounds on the original quadratically constrained problem of determining the lowest q - factor at a given total directivity @xmath21 .",
    "thus sdr formulation of the matrix version of @xmath100 for @xmath185 is convex and tight .",
