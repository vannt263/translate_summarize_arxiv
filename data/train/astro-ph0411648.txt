    "early type dwarfs ( de and dso ) are the most common type of galaxies in the nearby universe , yet their origin and nature are still unknown .",
    "these galaxies are found nearly exclusively near bright galaxies and in groups or clusters .",
    "their continuation or separation from the brighter elliptical sequence is currently debated @xcite .",
    "formation scenarios include mainly two different hypotheses : 1 ) des and dsos are primordial galaxies , 2 ) they are the result of a morphological transformation of spiral and irregular galaxies accreting into the cluster .",
    "this latter idea is supported by some observations , i.e the relative number density of dwarf early type galaxies increases with the local galaxy density @xcite , suggesting that the environment drives galaxy evolution .",
    "@xcite investigated the systematic properties of dark matter halos in late - type and dwarf spheroidal galaxies concluding that they form a single physical sequence as a function of the dark matter core mass . @xcite",
    "have shown that galaxy harassment in clusters can transform spirals into spheroidals .",
    "harassment can explain the morphological evolution of the small spiral and irregular galaxies observed in clusters at redshift @xmath2 @xcite into dwarf ellipticals in the nearby universe @xcite . moreover",
    "the radial velocities of early type galaxies in the virgo cluster seem to indicate that these galaxies are not an old cluster population @xcite but originate from infalling field galaxies . according to this evolutionary scenario",
    "we expect to find nearby cluster galaxies that are currently undergoing morphological transformation and retain part of their disk nature .",
    "recent observations confirm that early type galaxies have a broad range of photometric and kinematical characteristics . @xcite and @xcite discovered hidden spiral structures and bar features in five bright des in the virgo cluster , concluding that the fraction of early type dwarfs hosting a disk component could be larger than @xmath3 . spirals and disks were also observed within dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the coma @xcite and fornax clusters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the degree of rotational support is found to vary from zero to a value close to one expected for a galaxy flattened by rotation @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of this work is to follow the evolution of disk galaxies orbiting in a cluster environment using high resolution n - body simulations and to compare the final harassed remnants with the latest photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "previous studies have suffered from low resolution and they used idealised cluster models for the initial conditions .",
    "we aim to use sufficient resolution that we can follow the detailed morphological evolution and we evolve the galaxy models within a cluster selected from a cosmological simulation .",
    "in addition , the model has cuspy cdm halos and structural parameters as expected in the concordance cosmological model .",
    "this study complements that of @xcite who studied the evolution of luminous early type disk galaxies within a cosmological context .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the main characteristics of the galaxy models and the @xmath0 cluster used .",
    "the results of the three dimensional simulations are illustrated in section 3 , while in section 4 and 5 we report a projected photometric and kinematical analysis of the simulated remnants and the comparison with observations .",
    "all the simulations have been carried out using pkdgrav , a parallel multistepping n  body tree  code designed for high force accuracy @xcite .",
    "the galaxy model is a multi  component system with a stellar disk embedded in a spherical dark matter halo and was constructed using the technique described by @xcite .",
    "the dark matter distribution initially follows a nfw @xcite profile , which is adiabatically contracted in response to baryonic infall @xcite .",
    "the disk has an exponential surface density profile of the form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the disk mass and radial scale length ( in cylindrical coordinates ) , while the thin vertical structure is characterised by the scale height @xmath7 which sets the `` temperature '' of the disk @xmath8 the structural parameters of the disk and the halo are chosen so that the resulting rotation curve resembles that of a typical bulgeless late - type ( sc / sd ) disk galaxy @xcite .",
    "the model parameters are initialised following the same procedure as @xcite , which was based on the galaxy formation model of @xcite .",
    "the mass within the virial radius was set equal to @xmath9 m@xmath10 and the fraction of mass in the disk is @xmath11 .",
    "the contribution of the different components to the global rotation curve , assuming a disk scale length @xmath12 kpc and a concentration @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively virial and scale radius of the nfw halo ) is plotted in fig .",

    "the galaxies were evolved for @xmath37 8.4 gyrs in a @xmath38cdm cluster with a mass at @xmath39 comparable to that of virgo ( @xmath40 m@xmath10 ) and a virial radius @xmath41 of 1.8 mpc .",
    "the cluster , selected from a 300 mpc cube simulation @xcite with cosmological parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite , was resimulated at high resolution and corresponds to the intermediate resolution cluster d9 of @xcite .",
    "the number of particles within the virial radius is @xmath45 and the softening length is 2.4 kpc .    at @xmath46 we replaced 20 random cluster particles ( 10 within the virial radius and 10 within 20% of the virial radius ) with the high resolution galaxy model .",
    "only one galaxy model is used , in order to isolate the effects of orbit on the evolution .",
    "we assigned to the center of mass of each galaxy the same orbital position and velocity of the replaced particle .",
    "we replace particles rather than halos so as not to bias the results by omitting `` overmerged '' halos . internal velocities and lengths",

    "in particular the comoving velocities at a given redshift @xmath47 are expressed in terms of the hubble constant @xmath48 through the relation @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the physical and comoving coordinate and @xmath52 the scale factor @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "among the initial sample of 20 galaxies , only 13 are still within the cluster virial radius at @xmath39 , while the others lie on bound orbits between @xmath41 and 1.5 @xmath41 .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that about half of the halos which are presently at the outskirts of the cluster ( up to 2@xmath41 ) have a pericenter smaller than @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of many of the galaxies within the cluster is quite violent and due to a sequence of strong gravitational encounters with substructures and with the global cluster potential .",
    "most of the central galaxies lose a significant fraction of stars and undergo a complete morphological transformation from disks to spheroidal systems . in order to highlight the presence of hidden structures we applied to the stellar component of the simulation results the unsharp masking technique described in barazza et al . 2002 .",
    "this method consists of the following steps .",
    "the intensity of each pixel is replaced with the mean intensity of a given area around the pixel producing a smoothed image .",
    "the linear dimension of this area has to be close to the typical scale of the features that we want to uncover .",
    "the original image is then divided by the smoothed one .",
    "3 illustrates the results of the unsharp masking applied to a galaxy of our sample , where the eso s midas task filter / smooth is used for the image smoothing with a smoothing length of 30 - 40 pixels , corresponding to @xmath54 kpc .",

    "4 represents the different phases of the evolution of a galaxy transforming into a de .",
    "the first stage of the evolution is characterised by the formation of a strong bar @xcite and an open spiral pattern in the disk .",
    "the spiral arms are easily stripped while the remaining material forms a ring structure around the bar .",
    "the bar+ring phase is quite stable and is apparent in the final state of several of the remnant galaxies .",
    "often the ring is not directly visible in the simulation output , but is clearly seen after applying the unsharp masking . when gravitational heating due to tidal interactions removes the remaining spiral and ring features , only a naked bar remains .",
    "the bar usually undergoes a strong buckling instability and as a result the central part of the galaxy becomes more spherical .",
    "the buckled bar is subjected to further tidal heating and loses mass from its edges , becoming rounder the more encounters it suffers and the longer it evolves near to the cluster centre .",
    "5 illustrates the evolution of bar and buckling instabilities for a representative galaxy which is orbiting close to the center of the cluster at @xmath39 .",

    "6 shows a face and edge on projection of the same galaxy during the buckling phase where the bar appeared at @xmath59 .",
    "depending on the orbit and on the number of close encounters that the galaxy suffers , the morphological transformation of the stellar component can be complete and produce a pure spheroidal system , or can lead to the formation of a more elongated structure , which still retains disk and bar features ( fig .",
    "for a few galaxies orbiting closest to the cluster center the tidal effects from the cluster potential become dominant and the evolution is very rapid .",
    "8 shows the tidal tails generated by a strong impulsive encounter . the stripped mass is a large fraction of the total stellar mass and the surface density in the tails is comparable with that of the outer disk .",
    "we do not expect that this kind of structures will be easily observable in clusters , since their life time is quit short ( @xmath60 gyrs ) due to numerous encounters with other substructures which heat and dissipate the stripped material .",
    "stripped stars tend to create a diffuse distribution around the remnants ( see fig .",

    "we measure the kinematics of the 13 projected galaxies analyzed in section 4 using a 0.3 x 12 kpc slit , which corresponds , at the distance of virgo ( 15.3 mpc , @xcite ) to 3  x 40  .",
    "this radial range is comparable with the slit length adopted by van zee et al .",
    "2004 and allows us to observe in most of the galaxies the turnover of the rotation curve , while the thickness of the slit was set to the softening length of 0.1 kpc .",
    "the slit was positioned along the major axis of the projected remnant centered on the galaxy and star particles within the slit area were binned into a grid . for each grid interval with more than 15 particles  excluding thus the most weakly bound particles at the edges of the system  we calculated the mean particle velocity ( relative to the center of mass of the galaxy ) and velocity dispersion along the line of sight .",
    "for the two smallest remnants gal6 and gal8 we increased the number of bins in order to obtain more precise velocity curves .",
    "the resulting kinematic profiles are indicated in fig .",
    "15 , where for each galaxy the line of sight velocity ( left panels ) and velocity dispersion ( right panels ) are plotted as a function of the radial distance along the major axis . in most of the cases",
    "the remnants lose a large fraction of rotation velocity , but only for one galaxy ( gal6 ) we do not observe any significative rotation along the major axis .",

    "gal6 and gal8 do not show evidences for structures or disk features and are spheroidal systems with a c / a ratio larger ( table 1 ) than the other remnants and surface brightness profiles well fitted by exponential laws .",
    "moreover , they are quite small ( @xmath68 ) baryonic dominated galaxies presently orbiting at @xmath69 kpc from the cluster center .    is the lack of rotation observed in gal6 due to a projection effect , i.e. we are looking at the face on projection of a rotating system , or is it physically significative ?",
    "16 illustrates the kinematic profiles of gal6 and gal8 for different inclinations of the remnant : from the top to the bottom @xmath70 , which corresponds to a face - on projection , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( edge - on ) .",
    "the last panel on the bottom represents an end - on galaxy , with inclination @xmath72 and the three dimensional major axis aligned with the line of sight .",
    "gal6 shows traces of rotation only for @xmath73 , with a maximum rotational velocity @xmath74 , while the other projections have not well defined rotation curves and values of @xmath75 . in the case of non - rotating galaxies we estimated an upper limit for @xmath76 by differentiating the average velocities on each side of the major axis and dividing by two @xcite . in the calculation of @xmath76 for @xmath70 and @xmath72 we excluded points with velocity dispersion larger than @xmath77 ,",

    "( see fig .",
    "15 ) , gal2 , gal9 and gal10 are more massive systems if compared with the two spheroids gal6 and gal8 , but have still high c / a values , while the low line of sight velocity of gal12 is not related to a morphological transformation but is simply due to the fact that it is a spiral galaxy viewed face on ( fig .",
    "14 ) .    on the basis of this limited sample",
    "we expect non - rotating and slowly rotating dwarfs to have internal and environmental properties substantially different from the rotating ones .",
    "in particular the former seem to be the product of a violent morphological transformation accelerated by the proximity of the cluster center .",
    "this result is apparently in contradiction with geha et al .",
    "2003 who finds no relationship between the amount of rotation and the morphology or the orbital properties of the galaxies in their sample .    from fig .",
    "15 it appears evident that although the galaxies lose significant amounts of mass , the velocity dispersion can rise up to @xmath78 in the central 1 - 2 kpc .",
    "this is due to the bar formation and the transformation of circular to more radial orbits .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles are typically decreasing at larger radii but they rise again in those galaxies for which the slit semi - length approaches or exceeds the tidal radius .",
    "as the ratio between rotational velocity and velocity dispersion decreases , the galaxy loses rotational support and the flattening becomes dominated by anisotropic pressure .",
    "the degree of rotational support can be expressed in terms of the anisotropy parameter @xmath79 @xcite , defined as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the rotational velocity , @xmath82 and @xmath83 the mean projected velocity dispersion and ellipticity .",
    "the theoretical prediction for a rotationally flattened spheroidal is given by @xmath84 @xcite and is represented in fig .",

    "the observations of van zee et .",
    "al 2003 , which cover a larger radial extent due to the aperture size , gives to significantly higher values of @xmath76 respect geha et al .",
    "this appears to be due to the fact that the smaller slit used by the latter authors only samples the inner rising part of the rotation curve and does not include the maximum value .",
    "for example vcc 917 and vcc 1308 , classified as non - rotating galaxies ( both with @xmath85 km s@xmath67 ) by geha et al .",

    "most of the simulated remnants have a similar range of ellipticities and @xmath90 as the observed dwarfs , even if it is clear that we have some difficulties in reproducing galaxies with a degree of rotational support close to zero . on the other hand it is possible that the low @xmath90 ratio of some galaxies is due to the small radial range covered by the observations . in order to understand how much the slit length influences the results , in fig .",
    "18 we plotted the @xmath91 ratio of the projected remnants as a function of the radial distance along the slit . in most of the cases",
    "@xmath91 increases with radius ( with the remarkable exception of gal1 whose rotational support drops beyond @xmath92 kpc ) . using a 4 kpc slit we would find 10 galaxies below @xmath93 , 6 of which with @xmath94 and 3 well below @xmath95 , which is the upper limit assumed by geha et al .",

    "we follow the evolution of late type disk galaxies as they evolve within a hierarchically forming galaxy cluster using n - body simulations .",
    "we use a single galaxy model to explore the effects of cluster - centric position and orbit .",
    "our resolution is such that we can compare with keck and palomar kinematics and vlt imaging data .",
    "we find that :    \\(i ) the cluster environment can be responsible for triggering bar and buckling instabilities .",
    "\\(ii ) tidal shocks with dark matter substructures and the mean cluster potential are both important at driving the evolution from disks to spheroidal structures .",
    "however , galaxies within the inner 100 kpc suffer the most complete transformation .",
    "\\(iii ) none of the disks are completely destroyed therefore we do not expect to create ucd galaxies by progenitor disks with cuspy dark halos @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) more tidal heating leads to more mass loss which leads to rounder galaxies .",
    "\\(v ) the kinematics ( @xmath91 ) of the stellar remnants is similar to observations of virgo and fornax de / dsph galaxies . only the most severely disrupted galaxies which lose most of their stellar mass become completely pressure supported .",
    "most of the remnants retain a significant amount of rotational motion .",
    "\\(vi ) unsharp masked images of the galaxies show similar hidden bar and spiral features as some cluster galaxies .",
    "these gradually dissapear as the galaxies suffer more heating .",
    "our results could be rescaled in time and mass to make statements about possible disk progenitors entering group or even galactic environments .",
    "the next step is to self - consistently follow the evolution of galaxies as they form and evolve in different environments .",
    "our study has focussed on the evolution of a late type disk similar to the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the baryon fraction in the disk is relatively high and adiabatic contraction has enabled the galaxy to be more robust .",
    "disks such as m32 , have a baryon fraction about five times lower and thus will be more susceptible to tidal perturbations . exploring a large parameter space is beyond the scope of this paper , however we note that if we followed the evolution of fainter , baryon poor disks we would expect a more complete transformation to de / dsph and a lower fraction of galaxies with hidden features such as bars and disks .",
