    "a _ straight - line drawing _ of a plane graph @xmath0 is a drawing @xmath9 in which each vertex of @xmath0 is drawn as a distinct point on the plane and each edge of @xmath0 is drawn as a line segment connecting two end vertices without any edge crossing .",
    "a path @xmath10 in a straight - line drawing @xmath9 is _ monotone _ if there exists a line @xmath11 such that the orthogonal projections of the vertices of @xmath10 on @xmath11 appear along @xmath11 in the order they appear in @xmath10 .",
    "we call @xmath11 a _ monotone line _ ( or _ monotone direction _ ) of @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath9 is called a _ monotone drawing _ of @xmath0 if it contains at least one monotone path @xmath2 between every pair of vertices @xmath1 of @xmath0 .",
    "we call the monotone direction @xmath3 of @xmath2 the monotone direction for @xmath1 .    monotone drawing introduced by angelini et al .",
    "@xcite is a new visualization paradigm .",
    "consider the example described in @xcite : a traveler uses a road map to find a route from a town @xmath12 to a town @xmath13 .",
    "he would like to easily spot a path connecting @xmath12 and @xmath13 . this task is harder if each path from @xmath12 to @xmath13 on the map has legs moving away from @xmath12 .",
    "the traveler rotates the map to better perceive its content .",
    "hence , even if in the original map orientation all paths from @xmath12 to @xmath13 have annoying back and forth legs , the traveler might be happy to find one map orientation where a path from @xmath12 to @xmath13 smoothly goes from left to right .",
    "this approach is also motivated by human subject experiments : it was shown that the `` geodesic tendency '' ( paths following a given direction ) is important in understanding the structure of the underlying graphs @xcite .",
    "monotone drawing is also closely related to several other important graph drawing problems . in a monotone drawing , each monotone path is monotone with respect to a different line . in an _ upward drawing _",
    "@xcite , every directed path is monotone with respect to the positive @xmath14 direction .",
    "even more related to the monotone drawings are the _ greedy drawings _ @xcite . in a greedy drawing , for any two vertices @xmath15",
    ", there exists a path @xmath16 from @xmath12 to @xmath17 such that the euclidean distance from an intermediate vertex of @xmath16 to the destination @xmath17 decreases at each step .",
    "nllenburg et al .",
    "@xcite observed that while getting closer to the destination , a greedy path can make numerous turns and may even look like a spiral , which hardly matches the intuitive notion of geodesic - path tendency .",
    "in contrast , in a monotone drawing , there exists a path @xmath16 from @xmath12 to @xmath17 ( for any two vertices @xmath15 ) and a line @xmath18 such that the euclidean distance from the projection of an intermediate vertex of @xmath16 on @xmath11 to the projection of the destination @xmath17 on @xmath11 decreases at each step .",
    "so the monotone drawing better captures the notion of geodesic - path tendency .",
    "* related works : * angelini et al .",
    "@xcite showed that every tree of @xmath19 vertices has a monotone drawing of size @xmath20 ( using a dfs - based algorithm ) , or @xmath21 ( using a bfs - based algorithm ) .",
    "it was also shown that every biconnected planar graph of @xmath19 vertices has a monotone drawing in real coordinate space .",
    "several papers have been published since then .",
    "the focus of the research is to identify the graph classes having monotone drawings and , if so , to find monotone drawings for them with size as small as possible .",
    "angelini ( with another set of authors ) @xcite showed that every planar graph has a monotone drawing of size @xmath22 . however , their drawing is not straight line .",
    "it may need up to @xmath23 bends in the drawing .",
    "recently hossain and rahman @xcite showed that every planar graph has a monotone drawing .",
    "x. he and d. he @xcite showed that the classical schnyder drawing of 3-connected plane graphs on an @xmath24 grid is monotone .",
    "the monotone drawing problem for trees is particularly important .",
    "any drawing result for trees can be applied to any connected graph @xmath0 : first , we construct a spanning tree @xmath6 for @xmath0 , then find a monotone drawing @xmath9 for @xmath6 . @xmath9 is automatically a monotone drawing for @xmath0 ( although not necessarily planar ) .",
    "both the dfs- and bfs - based tree drawing algorithms in previous papers use the so - called stern - brocot tree to generate a set of @xmath25 primitive vectors ( will be defined later ) in increasing order of slope .",
    "then both algorithms do a post - order traversal of the input tree , assign each edge @xmath26 a primitive vector , and draw @xmath26 by using the assigned vector .",
    "such drawings of trees are called _ slope - disjoint_. kindermann et al .",
    "@xcite proposed another version of the slope - disjoint algorithm , but using a different set of primitive vectors ( based on _ farey sequence _ ) , which slightly decreases the grid size to @xmath27 .",
    "recently , x. he and d. he reduced the drawing size to @xmath28 by using a set of more compact primitive vectors @xcite .",
    "a stronger version of monotone drawings is the",
    "_ strong monotone drawing _ : for every two vertices @xmath1 in the drawing of @xmath0 , there must exist a path @xmath2 that is monotone with respect to the line passing through @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "since the strong monotone drawing is not a subject of this paper , we refer readers to @xcite for related results and references .    * our results : * we show that every @xmath19-vertex tree @xmath6 admits a monotone drawing on a grid of size @xmath5 , which is asymptotically optimal .",
