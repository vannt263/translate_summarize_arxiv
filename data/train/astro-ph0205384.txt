    "sub - horizon scale fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide a direct view of simple , causal physical processes in the early universe . in standard cosmological models ,",
    "the dominant processes are acoustic oscillations of the primordial plasma and photon - diffusive damping , which give rise to a harmonic series of peaks in the cmb anisotropy spectrum modulated by an exponential cutoff on small angular scales @xcite .",
    "measurements of the cmb power spectrum in this regime provide strong constraints on cosmological parameters @xcite , determine the nature and initial conditions of the fluctuations @xcite , and provide fundamental tests of particle physics @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments have detected peaks in the anisotropy spectrum @xcite , which constrain the cosmological models through measurements of the first , second , and possibly the third acoustic peaks .",
    "observations at high multipoles ( @xmath8 ) , where the physics is strongly affected by photon diffusion and the thickness of the last scattering region , provide independent constraints on these fundamental parameters . at even higher multipoles ( @xmath9 ) , secondary effects such as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are expected to dominate @xcite and hence offer the prospect of studying the formation of large - scale structure at recent times .",
    "this paper is one in a series reporting results from the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) .",
    "we have previously reported results between @xmath10 and @xmath11 in which we detected a damping tail in the spectrum ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) .",
    "these measurements support the standard theoretical models of cmb anisotropies . in the present paper , paper ii",
    ", we present measurements with the cbi taken from january through december of 2000 .",
    "these observations extend our determination of the cmb anisotropy spectrum out to @xmath12 .",
    "the results are derived from deep integrations on three pairs of pointings .",
    "we present a brief overview of the instrument and site in   [ sec : instrument ] and discuss our observing technique in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] .",
    "the data analysis methods are presented in   [ sec : analysis ] , including , in ",
    "[ subsec : maximumlikelihood ] , a discussion of the maximum - likelihood analysis used to determine the power spectrum and , in   [ subsec : sources ] , a discussion of the method of removing the discrete source foreground .",
    "we present our results in   [ sec : results ] , and review our conclusions in ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the remaining papers in the series cover the cbi mosaic power spectrum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iii ) ; the implementation of the maximum likelihood analysis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iv ) ; the cosmological interpretation of our results ( * ?",
    "* hereafter paper v ) ; and a possible interpretation of the excess power observed at high-@xmath1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper vi ) .",
    "a detailed description of the cbi can be found in the paper by @xcite , so we summarize here only important aspects of the instrument design .",
    "the cbi is a planar synthesis array of 13 0.9-meter diameter cassegrain antennas mounted on a 6-meter diameter tracking platform .",
    "short baselines are susceptible to contamination from cross - talk , so the antennas are surrounded by cylindrical shields which provide more than 110 db of isolation . further rejection of cross - talk is accomplished through the use of differenced observations ( see  [ sec : observations ] ) . a key feature of the cbi is its sensitive broadband receivers , which are based on indium phosphide high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) amplifiers operating in the 2636 ghz band .",
    "the system temperatures measured on the telescope , including cmb , ground , and atmosphere , are typically @xmath13 .",
    "the receiver outputs are combined in an analog correlator with 10 1-ghz bands .",
    "a @xmath14 phase switching scheme is used to reject cross - talk in the electronics .",
    "the antenna platform is on a 3-axis mount with azimuth , elevation , and parallactic angle axes ; the elevation is restricted to @xmath15 .",
    "the parallactic angle rotation provides the ability to track the rotation of the sky throughout the observation so that the @xmath16 orientation of a baseline on the sky is fixed , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the orthogonal components of the baseline length measured in wavelengths .",
    "the platform is moved through additional discrete steps in orientation to increase the @xmath16 coverage , test for false signals , and increase ground rejection .",
    "the antennas can be placed in different locations on the platform , allowing the configuration to be matched to a range of science goals .",
    "the cbi is located at an altitude of 5080 m in the atacama desert of northern chile , near the proposed site for the atacama large millimeter array @xcite .",
    "this high dry site was chosen in order to reduce atmospheric brightness fluctuations which would otherwise limit the sensitivity of the cbi . during the calendar year 2000 , @xmath19 of the nights were lost to weather and @xmath20 to equipment malfunction . observing conditions",
    "were best from mid - august through mid - december , when no nights were lost to weather . in the nights when observing conditions were good",
    ", there is no evidence of atmospheric effects in the cbi data except for rare instances which typically correlate with the appearance of visible , low - lying clouds .",
    "the data for the results presented here were obtained from 2000 january 11 to december 12 . during this period both",
    "deep observations of individual fields and mosaiced observations of multiple pointings were made .",
    "we present in this paper the results for three deep fields , two of which are part of the mosaics ; the cbi mosaic data , images , and power spectra are discussed in paper iii .",
    "we refer to these three deep fields collectively as the cbi deep fields , and individually as deep 08h , deep 14h , and deep 20h .",
    "we obtained 42 , 9 , and 49 good nights of observing on these fields .",
    "thus most of our results come from the deep 08h and deep 20h fields , with the deep 14h providing a somewhat weaker independent check .",
    "all of the deep fields were chosen to have low point - source contamination levels using the nrao very large array sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nvss ) .    in order to eliminate the influence of solar radiation in distant sidelobes ,",
    "observations were made only at night . for similar reasons ,",
    "no observations were used for which the field was less than @xmath21 from the moon .",
    "our results are insensitive to the precise lunar cut beyond @xmath21 .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the cbi has no ground shield and observations are differenced in order to remove signals due to ground pickup on the short baselines . to accomplish this , two fields , designated _",
    "lead _ and _ trail _ , separated by 8 minutes in right ascension , are tracked across almost identical ranges of azimuth and elevation .",
    "ground pickup and other contaminating signals are cancelled in the @xmath22 difference as long as they are stable over an 8 minute time - span .",
    "the potential residual of this in the differenced data has been shown in paper i to be @xmath23 of the cosmic signal .",
    "l l l l l l deep 08h & 08:44:40 & 08:52:40 & -03:10:00 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 + deep 14h & 14:42:00 & 14:50:00 & -03:50:00 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 + deep 20h & 20:48:40 & 20:56:40 & -03:30:00 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 +    the coordinates of the _ lead _ and _ trail _ fields for the 3 cbi deep fields , the total integration times on _ lead _ and _ trail _ combined , and the galactic latitudes are shown in table  [ tbl : field_coords ] .",
    "the integration times shown are computed after all data filters have been applied .    for the observations reported in this paper",
    ", four antenna configurations were used .",
    "the first configuration , on which the results of paper i were based , was a ring configuration , with most of the receivers near the perimeter of the platform .",
    "this provided fairly uniform @xmath16 coverage , many long baselines for robust calibration , and good access to the antennas and instrumentation on the platform during the testing which accompanied initial observations .",
    "the second and third configurations were better optimized for the cbi mosaic observations .",
    "these more compact configurations provided higher sensitivity in the @xmath10@xmath30 range , and were well - suited to low - redshift sunyaev - zeldovich observations .",
    "in addition , the third configuration provided nearly redundant baselines at different frequencies which enabled us to make a more accurate determination of the radio frequency spectrum of the signals reported in paper i. the last configuration was an extended configuration with more uniform coverage than the first , more long ( @xmath31 ) baselines , which are useful for point source monitoring , and greater sensitivity for the frequency spectrum determination out to @xmath32 .",
    "the distributions of the weights of the data as a function of @xmath1 is shown in figure  [ fig : wtplot ] .",
    "the 08h field was observed in the first , second and fourth configurations ; the 14h field in the first configuration ; and the 20h field in the third configuration .    in the first three configurations , all but one of the receivers were configured to be sensitive to left circular polarization ( lcp ) ; the remaining receiver was sensitive to right circular polarization ( rcp ) . in the last configuration",
    "all antennas were configured for lcp .",
    "the equatorial sky coverage and relatively large antennas of the cbi enable us to use a variety of celestial objects as calibrators , including planets , supernova remnants , radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "this is convenient for comparing the cbi flux density scale with other measurements ( see below ) and for accurately calibrating the data .",
    "cbi observations are calibrated using nightly measurements of primary calibrators , chosen for their strength and lack of variability at these frequencies ( jupiter , saturn , tau a [ 3c144 , the crab nebula ] , and vir a [ 3c274 ] ) , and a set of secondary calibrators ( 3c279 , 3c273 , j1743@xmath33038 , b1830@xmath33210 , and j1924@xmath33292 ) . our estimates of the primary calibrator flux densities are based on cbi measurements of these sources relative to jupiter assuming an apparent rayleigh - jeans brightness temperature @xmath34 at 32 ghz @xcite . this value is uncorrected for the occultation of the cmb by the planet , and applying this correction yields a rayleigh - jeans brightness temperature of @xmath35 .",
    "this is also the basis of the very small array calibration @xcite .",
    "since jupiter is known to have a non - thermal spectrum at these frequencies , and the precise spectral shape is not independently well - determined , this flux density scale is transferred to each of the cbi bands by observations of tau a , for which the @xcite spectral index @xmath36 is assumed , where @xmath37 .",
    "there is good evidence that the power law index extends to high frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the flux densities of the secondary calibrators are bootstrapped from the nearest primary calibrator observations , and are used when the primary calibrators are either not visible or are too close to the moon .",
    "observations of the primary calibrators over the year 2000 indicate random calibration errors of @xmath38 night - to - night .",
    "the residuals of a polynomial fit to the light curves of the secondary calibrators show a similar scatter . in light of this and the @xmath39 calibration uncertainty of the @xcite value for the temperature of jupiter we assign a calibration uncertainty of @xmath40 to our data .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath41 uncertainty in bandpower ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "these include the beam uncertainties discussed below .",
    "we have two comparisons of our flux density scale with that of the nrao very large array ( vla ) at 22.4 ghz .",
    "first , we compare cbi observations of mars with the model for the mars temperature which is used at the vla @xcite , improved by m. gurwell and b. butler ( private communication , february 2002 ) .",
    "r. perley ( private communication , february 2002 ) has shown that the flux density scale at 22.4 ghz based on this mars temperature model agrees to within @xmath43 with the flux density scale determined at this frequency based on a model of ngc7027 derived by a. van hoof ( private communication , february 2002 ) .",
    "the ratio of the temperature of mars from the cbi to that of the improved rudy model is @xmath44 .",
    "our second comparison is based on observations of 3c273 on the cbi and the vla at 7 epochs for which the time interval between observations on the two instruments was small enough to eliminate uncertainties due to source variability .",
    "the vla observations have been calibrated using the improved rudy mars model at 22.4 ghz , and the cbi 2636 ghz measurements have been extrapolated to this frequency .",
    "the ratio of the flux density of 3c273 on the cbi to that on the vla is @xmath45 . from the weighted averages of these two tests we find that the cbi flux density scale , based on the @xcite absolute calibration , is @xmath46 lower than the vla flux density scale at 22.4 ghz .",
    "the level of agreement between these two scales is clearly fortuitous , but it does give us confidence that the @xmath40 calibration uncertainty we estimate for the cbi flux density scale is , if anything , conservative .",
    "individual scans of calibrators and the microwave background are bracketed by measurements of an internal noise calibration source whose equivalent flux density for each baseline and channel is determined by reference to the celestial flux density calibrators . the noise calibration source was initially intended to remove instrumental gain fluctuations over the course of a night , but we found that the instrumental gains were more stable ( @xmath38 rms variations ) than the noise calibration source output and so this was not used .",
    "this is primarily because of the difficulty in stabilizing the temperature of the noise calibration source amplifier and various other components , all of which lie outside of the cryogenic dewars .",
    "all of the ( complex ) noise calibration source measurements for a given night are averaged together and the data from all baselines are scaled to give an identical response .",
    "this removes baseline - based gain and phase calibration errors ; it also introduces antenna - based errors which are removed by the subsequent ( antenna - based ) primary flux density calibration . at the start and end of each night of observing the relative gain and phase errors between the real and imaginary channels",
    "were measured using the noise calibration source with and without a @xmath47 phase shift applied to the receiver local oscillator .",
    "the rms quadrature phase is @xmath48 and the rms gain errors are @xmath49 .",
    "the solutions are stable over a timescale of several weeks .",
    "_ lead _ and _ trail _ scans of the cmb fields are interleaved with 1 minute observations of bright ( @xmath50 ) nearby calibrators which provide a check on the telescope pointing . from these observations we determine that the absolute rms radio pointing is @xmath51 , while the rms tracking errors are @xmath52 .",
    "data are flagged by both automatic and manual filters .",
    "the on - line control system identifies corrupt or potentially unreliable data .",
    "these affect periods when the telescope was not tracking properly , a receiver was warm , a local oscillator was not phase locked , the total power of a receiver was out of the normal range , or when a receiver phase - shifter was not acquired .",
    "observer notes were also used to examine periods when there were instrumental problems that might have affected the data quality or there was bad weather , identified by visible cloud cover or corrupted visibilites on the short baselines . a small fraction ( @xmath53 ) of the data",
    "were deleted manually on the basis of these inspections .",
    "subsequent automatic data edits are based on the data scatter and baseline - to - baseline correlations .",
    "the first level of rejection is a @xmath54 scan - wise outlier edit to eliminate occasional instrumental glitches which give rise to large signals in individual samples .",
    "this cut affects a negligible fraction of the data , and our results are not sensitive to the precise level of this cut .",
    "further automated data - filtering is provided by our differencing procedure , which also generates an accurate estimate of the thermal noise in each scan for each baseline and frequency channel .",
    "to do the differencing , individual 8.4-s integrations in the _ lead _ and _ trail _ scans , which are taken 8 minutes apart , are matched and subtracted . since our fields are separated by 8  min in observing time , the typical scan length is @xmath55 s after slewing and firing the noise calibration source , corresponding to @xmath56 integrations of 8.4 s each . in order to prevent a few short scans from biasing the statistics , any scan with fewer than 30 pairs of 8.4 s",
    "integrations was rejected .",
    "the noise estimates are derived from the differences between the @xmath57 and @xmath58 fields for individual scans of @xmath59 8.4 sec integrations .",
    "data from different baselines and times which contribute to the same @xmath16 points are subsequently combined .",
    "this leads to an underestimate of @xmath60% in the variance ( see appendix ) which we correct for in our statistical analyses and spectrum determinations .",
    "the celestial signals are stationary on an 8-minute timescale , and constant ground signal is cancelled by the @xmath61 differencing",
    ". the noise will be increased by atmospheric noise , ground signal variations , or previously unflagged instrumental anomalies . on this basis",
    "any scan for which the rms of the samples is greater than twice the expected thermal noise level is rejected : this primarily eliminates periods affected by weather .",
    "less than @xmath62 of the data are rejected by this filter .",
    "the noise level is established with reference to data which are clearly free of atmospheric contamination ; it is highly repeatable and within @xmath63 of the expected thermal noise level .    in computing the data differences and thermal noise level",
    ", we also compute the covariance between all baseline - channel pairs , i.e. , the thermal noise covariance matrix . for the deep 08h field ,",
    "a single night ( 2000 january 12 ) was found to have statistically significant off - diagonal correlations . on this night",
    "there were clear instances of atmosphere emission on the short baselines , and the baseline correlations are likely due to poor weather .",
    "this day was excluded from the analysis .",
    "no anomalous correlations are seen in the deep 14h data .",
    "the correlation test on the deep 20h data revealed a single baseline - channel with a large real - imaginary anti - correlation . when this baseline - channel was eliminated from the 20h dataset ,",
    "no significant baseline - baseline correlations are seen .",
    "the excision of these data from the 08h and 20h fields has a negligible effect on the measured power spectrum , suggesting that lower - level , undetected correlator problems of a similar nature also do not affect our result .",
    "the telescope primary beam has been measured accurately using observations of tau a. the primary beam width ( fwhm ) is @xmath64 arc minutes ; we estimate a @xmath65 uncertainty in the beamwidth .",
    "this gives rise to a @xmath66 contribution to our overall calibration error .",
    "note that unlike the case for total power experiments , uncertainties in the primary beam width for an interferometer affect only the overall temperature scale , and do not introduce an @xmath1-dependent systematic error . the beam - width measurement is described in paper iii .",
    "the determination of the angular power spectrum of the sky from interferometer measurements has been discussed by @xcite and @xcite ; the more general framework of power spectrum estimation is discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we present a brief overview of our procedure .",
    "the details of the method are given in paper iv .",
    "we test a space of hypothetical models for the spectrum , @xmath67 , against the data using the likelihood function as a figure of merit . for complex data",
    "points @xmath68 with zero mean and gaussian noise described by the covariance matrix @xmath69 , this is @xmath70 where the covariance matrix , @xmath71 , is given by @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the noise covariance and @xmath74 is the sky ( or theoretical cmb ) covariance for band @xmath75 .",
    "the foreground covariance is made up of @xmath76 , a constraint matrix for point sources with known positions , and @xmath77 , a matrix which models the contribution of faint point sources of unknown position .",
    "the calculation of the expected sky variance @xmath74 is discussed in many references ( e.g. , @xcite ; paper i ; paper iv ) . for a well - designed interferometer",
    "the noise term @xmath78 is diagonal ( see also   [ subsec : calib_edit ] ) .",
    "the pre - factors @xmath79 and @xmath80 are held fixed at _ a priori _ values ( see   [ subsubsec : statisticalsources ] ) . as discussed below",
    ", the @xmath81 are varied to yield estimates of the microwave background bandpower .",
    "for the present analysis of the deep field data we adopt a parametric description of the @xmath67 as seven bins with lower boundaries at @xmath82 , 500 , 880 , 1445 , 2010 , 2388 , and 3000 . within each bin , the power spectrum is assumed to be flat in @xmath83 .",
    "the overall amplitudes of the bins @xmath81 are treated as free parameters in the maximization of the likelihood .",
    "the spacing of @xmath84 is set by the intrinsic resolution of the cbi in the aperture plane ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "here @xmath84 is the fwhm of the visibility window function ( see paper iii ) .",
    "this resolution can be increased by mosaicing .",
    "the divisions above were chosen to coincide with breaks in the multi - configuration @xmath16 coverage , which minimize correlations between adjacent bins . given the @xmath16-coverage of our data , this choice of binning yields @xmath86@xmath87 anti - correlations between adjacent bins .",
    "to demonstrate that our results are not sensitive to the choice of bins , we have also conducted the analysis with an alternate set of bins whose boundaries are halfway between those of the primary binning described above ( six bins with lower boundaries at @xmath82 , 690 , 1162 , 1728 , 2199 , and 2694 ) .",
    "window functions for each band are shown in figure  [ fig : deepwins ] .",
    "these show the sensitivity of a given bandpower bin to power in individual multipoles as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we compute the parameter uncertainties and correlations from the curvature of the likelihood at the best - fit locus . in practice",
    "we use the fisher matrix @xmath88 as a computationally efficient estimator of the curvature . in the approximation that the likelihood function is gaussian",
    ", @xmath89 is the correlation matrix of the fitted parameters . as a check on the fisher matrix results , we have also mapped the likelihoods in individual bands and checked against the error bars computed in the offset log - normal approximation @xcite .",
    "we find good agreement between these three methods .",
    "monte carlo tests of simulated cbi data show that these error estimates , as well as the bandpower estimates themselves , are unbiased .",
    "the dominant foreground for the cbi is composed of discrete extragalactic radio sources described by the correlation matrices @xmath77 and @xmath90 . for purposes of this analysis we neglect other possible foregrounds , although see ",
    "[ sec : results ] for limits on the possible contribution of foregrounds on large angular scales .",
    "since in the small - angle limit interferometers directly measure linear combinations of the sky fourier modes , the extraction of angular power spectra from the data is in principle simpler than in the case of total power experiments . in general , however , @xmath91 has non - negligible off - diagonal elements , and depending on the @xmath16-sampling of the dataset this matrix can be large . to deal with the computational challenge of inverting this matrix , we have developed a fourier gridding algorithm .",
    "this algorithm constructs a data vector composed of linear combinations of the visibility data and calculates the resulting covariance matrix .",
    "for single - field analyses such as we report here , the primary effect of this gridding is to reduce redundancies in the @xmath16-dataset caused by dense aperture plane sampling .",
    "this compression is typically a factor of 3 to 4 : for each field there are several thousand visibilities , which are gridded down to 970 estimators .",
    "this results in over an order of magnitude increase in the speed of the likelihood analysis .",
    "this pipeline and the associated formalism are discussed in paper iv .",
    "the pipeline was implemented on the 4 and 32 processor shared memory alpha gs320 and es45 clusters at cita .",
    "the codes were parallelized using open mp directives .",
    "a complete joint analysis of the three deep fields takes approximately 4 cpu hours .",
    "this includes pre - gridding and the calculation of all ancillary quantities such as the bandpower window functions , likelihood maps and noise spectra .",
    "bandpower estimates can be obtained in as little as 1 cpu hour for the deep field data .",

    "extragalactic radio sources are the dominant foreground to cmb observations over the 2636 ghz frequency band on arcminute scales @xcite .",
    "if no allowance for this foreground is made , the few brightest discrete sources in each field dominate any power spectrum determination beyond @xmath92 .",
    "while much is known about radio source populations at lower frequencies , this is not the case at 31 ghz , and observations at this frequency are essential in dealing with the point source contamination at high @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore constructed a 2634 ghz receiver for the ovro 40 meter telescope which we have used to study the source population at this frequency and to provide a direct check on the cbi calibration .",

    "the flux densities of the sources detected in both the deep and mosaic maps are consistent with the ovro determinations , with the agreement typically within @xmath40 .",
    "as discussed above , the ovro - detected bright sources were directly subtracted from the cbi data since the ovro source subtraction is a step in the standard data - analysis pipeline which has been useful in producing diagnostic images of the data . in   [ subsubsec : statisticalsources ]",
    "we discuss a method ( the constraint matrix approach of @xcite ) of dealing with point source foregrounds which does not require knowledge of the source flux densities .",
    "we find that this method applied to the ovro sources gives very similar results as direct subtraction .",
    "these complementary techniques of dealing with this bright source population have been useful in extending our power spectrum measurments to the instrumental limit of 3500 .",
    "in addition to the brightest sources in the cbi fields , which have been measured and subtracted with the ovro data , we must deal with sources too faint to measure directly but which contribute statistically to our measurements . since most radio sources have spectra which fall towards higher frequencies , and since there are wide - area radio sky surveys at lower frequencies with sensitivities comparable to what we have in the cbi deep field maps , most of the sources which contribute are readily identified from the low - frequency surveys . for this purpose",
    "we use the nvss .",
    "there is also a small contribution due to sources which are too faint to appear even in nvss .",
    "we call these latter `` residual '' sources and estimate their contribution from the cbi 31 ghz source counts .",
    "after the subtraction of the bright sources monitored at ovro , there remain three components of point source contamination : one due to data correlations induced by the ( imperfect ) ovro source subtraction ; a component due to the nvss sources whose positions are known , but whose flux densities are not measured at 31 ghz ; and a residual component due to sources whose contribution must be estimated from source counts .",

    "we note that it is possible to allow the @xmath173 to be free parameters in the fit , and we do not find significantly different results in this case ; however it is more conservative to fix the @xmath173 at very large values .",

    "we adopt the strategy of projecting the modes corresponding to ovro residuals and nvss sources out of our data .",

    "we then set @xmath176 which projects these modes out of the data .",
    "we find that our power spectra at high @xmath1 , where point sources are most troublesome , are little affected by variations in @xmath173 between @xmath177 to @xmath178 .    at significantly larger values of @xmath173",
    "the matrices are numerically ill - conditioned .",
    "we have tested the source projection algorithm extensively on both real and simulated data and find that it is robust against , for instance , randomly reassigning estimated variances between sources and randomly perturbing the source positions assumed in the projection by @xmath179 ( rms ) .",

    "hence are residual , the sources are extrapolated down to 1.4 ghz using the observed ovro - nvss distribution of spectral indices ( with @xmath164  see   [ subsubsec : brightsources ] ) .",
    "since the ovro survey is strongly biased towards flat - spectrum sources this will overestimate the residual source power level .",
    "we find a 31 ghz variance of @xmath184 .",
    "we get a similar result , @xmath185 from the analytic calculation described in paper iv . in our highest bin",
    "this corresponds to a power level of @xmath186 , which is less than the thermal noise in this bin and all others ; we assign an uncertainty of @xmath187 to this value , corresponding to @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "this uncertainty is based on varying the number counts and spectral index parameters within the range allowed by their uncertainties , and rerunning the monte carlo simulations used to calculate the residual power .",
    "comparable power levels are obtained if , instead of using the 31 ghz counts , we extrapolate in frequency from the 1.4 ghz number counts using a simple gaussian model for the spectral index distribution which is constrained to reproduce the detection statistics observed in the ovro survey . as a test on the robustness of this correction we re - ran the power spectrum analysis doubling the nvss / residual source threshold from 3.4 to 6.8 mjy at 1.4 ghz with similar results .",
    "the number density of the residual sources on the sky is too high to permit full projection of these data modes , and in any case their positions are not known so this would be impossible .",
    "we therefore fix @xmath190 , which approximately corresponds to subtracting our conservative estimate of the residual source power level from the spectrum .",
    "the cost of projecting out the nvss sources is a loss of sensitivity of the cbi at high @xmath1 due to our limited knowledge of the faint point sources at 31 ghz .",
    "the best way to address this problem in the near term is with a sensitive 31 ghz receiver on the nrao green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",

    "this procedure identified three days on the deep 20h field which were formally inconsistent with the total dataset .",
    "we exclude these days from the analysis , which has a small ( @xmath192 ) effect on our results .",
    "the visibilities for all other days were consistent with the estimate of the visibilities from the rest of the data .",
    "a typical value of the @xmath191 of an individual day as compared with the rest of the dataset is @xmath193 with @xmath194 .",
    "for such a day the probability of exceeding this value under the null hypothesis is 65% .",
    "the data on each configuration of each field was also subdivided in half by time , subtracted , and then compared in this manner .",
    "the @xmath195 values for these tests on the 08h data ( 3 configurations ) , and the 14h , and 20h data ( each one configuration ) were @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 for @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 , respectively .",
    "these results indicate that our estimate of the thermal noise variance is correct to within @xmath53 .",
    "we have used the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to determine if the visibility data are consistent with a gaussian distribution .",
    "this is the expectation when the signal - to - noise - ratio per baseline - channel combination is low , as is the case for the @xmath206 data on any given field once the bright point sources have been subtracted .",
    "the quantity of interest is the ratio of the visibility to its estimated uncertainty @xmath207 if the @xmath208 were known _ a priori _ then @xmath209 would have a gaussian distribution with unit dispersion . as discussed in the appendix ,",
    "however , this is not the case , and a @xmath210 correction to the expected standard deviation ( @xmath211 ) of @xmath209 is required .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in   [ subsubsec : chi2 ] , we have only determined that our measurements of the thermal noise are accurate at the @xmath212 level .",
    "we therefore apply the ks test to the data under the null hypothesis that the observed distribution of @xmath209 is consistent with a gaussian distribution of zero mean and @xmath213 , but vary @xmath211 by @xmath214 for each dataset .",

    "the power spectrum estimates derived from the shortest baselines show the effect of ground - spillover , but at @xmath227 they are within a factor of @xmath228 ( in @xmath229k ) of the differenced spectrum , and are seen to fall strongly with increasing @xmath1 . since the cmb signals on the short baselines are up to a factor of @xmath230 ( in @xmath229k ) less than the ground signal on these baselines , the low power levels in the undifferenced spectrum indicate that the signal averages down when data from many days and position angles are combined . at multipoles @xmath206 the undifferenced signal is within @xmath231 of the differenced spectrum except in a single bin . in this bin ( @xmath232 )",
    "the undifferenced power level was originally found to be about twice the thermal noise level .",
    "this was traced to correlator offsets in a single channel on several baselines .",
    "since the @xmath191 of the differenced data on these baselines are consistent within the noise with data from other baselines and the power spectrum is not significantly affected by the exclusion of the channel in question , we infer that the contamination is effectively removed by our differencing procedure .",

    "however , sources with spectral indices up to @xmath319 have been detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have therefore explored the possibility that a seperate population of objects , not seen in the nvss or accounted for in the residual source correction , might be responsible for the excess . for this hypothetical population , we assume a power - law integrated number - flux density slope @xmath320 at 31 ghz , and we then compare the number density of sources in this hypothetical population required to produce the observed excess with the limits from the cbi data , where we found no sources above the 5-@xmath321 cutoff in the deep or mosaic fields which were not correctly identified with nvss sources , as discussed in   [ subsubsec : brightsources ] . even for the very steep integrated source count slope of @xmath322 , which has not been observed at low flux densities and high frequencies , we find that the number density of sources in this hypothetical population required to explain the excess exceeds the upper limit from the cbi observations by @xmath323 .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that such a hypothetical population of inverted spectrum sources is responsible for the excess .",
    "the apparent excess would be explained if we had underestimated the residual source correction by a factor of @xmath324 .",
    "we have been unable to construct a model which achieves this while remaining consistent with the source counts we have derived at 31 ghz , and source statistics at other frequencies .",
    "in this paper we have presented measurements of the cmb power spectrum out to @xmath325 , beyond the scales probed by boomerang , maxima , and dasi and well into the damping tail region of the spectrum .",
    "our present results confirm our previous detection of a drop in power at multipoles above @xmath326 relative to the level at lower multipoles , based on a subset of the data used here ( paper i ) , and show that the decline in power persists out to @xmath2 .",

    "the power detected here is greater than that seen in other experiments including our own mosaic observations ( paper iii ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , most of this discrepancy is due to the first bin .",
    "the cbi mosaic spectrum ( paper iii ) , which is based on a larger area and therefore has lower sample variance than the deep field results , has power levels at low @xmath1 which show excellent consistency with the boomerang , dasi , and maxima results .",
    "it is therefore likely that the discrepancy seen in the deep fields is due to the large sample variance in the low-@xmath1 mode estimates from these fields .    in paper",
    "v we discuss the constraints which the cbi deep and mosaic data provide on standard cosmological parameters .",
    "the cbi mosaic fields are much more powerful for this purpose than the deeps due to their higher @xmath1-resolution and lower cosmic variance .",
    "the deep fields , however , provide a robust check on the results : we find @xmath328 ; @xmath329 ; @xmath330 ; and an age for the universe of @xmath331 .",
    "these results assume the weak-@xmath332 prior ( discussed in paper v ) and use only the deep field power spectra out to @xmath299 , where consistency with standard models of the instrinsic anisotropy is observed .",
    "more discussion of these results and the analysis method can be found in paper v.    above @xmath2 we detect a @xmath5 excess in power relative to the best - fit curve .",
    "possible explanations of this excess are :    1 .   data analysis error .",
    "we have tested our analysis by developing two independent software pipelines , and by developing a simulation program which generates data sets which mimic the @xmath16 coverage and the distribution of measurement uncertainties of the real data set precisely .",
    "we have subjected both real and simulated data analyzed with both pipelines to a large battery of tests , and have been unable to find significant inconsistencies .",
    "instrumental problems .",
    "any instrumental signals which are stable over an 8-minute time span are removed to high precision by the differencing ; instrumental signals which vary on @xmath333 minute time spans would be evident in the doubly - differenced power spectra , but we see no such signals .",
    "it is also possible that there are inadequately modeled instrumental effects",
    ". a prime candidate would be pointing errors , but our pointing errors of @xmath334 are too small to account for an effect of this magnitude .",
    "3 .   primary cmb anisotropy .",
    "this is inconsistent with standard theories which fit the low-@xmath1 range well , and is therefore an unlikely explanation .",
    "4 .   diffuse galactic foreground .",
    "we can not rule out this possibility with the present observations .",
    "higher sensitivity observations at the same frequency or at a higher frequency could test this possibility .",
    "we can not account for the signal with known diffuse foregrounds , and the sensitivity is too low to constrain the spectral index of the signal at these multipoles .",
    "however , in view of the anomalous component of galactic emission that has been detected at this frequency by @xcite , we are pursuing correlation analysis of the sky images with the _ iras _ 100  @xmath229 m flux density , and with other signals , such as the h@xmath335 intensity . 5 .   residual point sources .",
    "this appeared initially to be a likely candidate , but the constraint matrix approach to removing point source foregrounds has proved to be remarkably robust , and our 31 ghz source counts have enabled us to place strong limits on the hypothetical population of inverted - spectrum point sources needed to produce the excess . while we can not strictly rule out such a population , a very steep integral counts slope would be implied ( @xmath336 or steeper ) , as well as a normalization which is inconsistent at the @xmath337 level with that determined from the cbi - determined source counts .",
    "future 30 ghz surveys with the gbt will allow this issue to be further addressed .",
    "secondary anisotropy .",
    "there has been great interest in predicting the nature of the statistical sze contribution to the cmb anisotropy on small angular scales , using both analytical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and numerical ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) methods .",
    "these works generally predict a crossover between the intrinsic cmb and sze signals at @xmath2@xmath338 .",
    "the level of sze anisotropy forecast by theoretical models is in the range of @xmath339 to @xmath340 , depending sensitively on the rms mass fluctuation on large scales in the present universe ( characterized by @xmath341 ) .",
    "therefore secondary sze anisotropy is , at some level , likely to contribute to the excess we report , but it is not clear if the majority of the observed signal can be attributed to the sze . if sze anisotropies were to be the cause of the observed excess , values of @xmath7 would be favored . for a detailed discussion of the possible implications of the observed excess for models of sze anisotropies ,",
    "see paper vi .",
    "other possible contributors to signals on these angular scales include the vishniac effect @xcite , patchy re - ionization @xcite and gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "all of these are expected to be small effects compared to the signal we observe .",
    "it should be borne in mind that if the signal is due to non - gaussian structures then the sample variance errors in our result and others will have been underestimated ; see , for example , @xcite and paper vi .",
    "@xcite have reported a tentative ( 1.3@xmath321 ) detection with the bima array at the same frequency on a smaller angular scale .",
    "these investigators place a @xmath304 upper limit of @xmath342 , corresponding to @xmath343 at @xmath344 .",
    "since this measurement is at higher @xmath1 than the excess we have found here , it is possible that these two results are not directly comparable , but as discussed in paper vi they could both be affected by secondary sze anisotropy .",
    "the key result of this paper is the clear demonstration of the existence of a damping tail to the anisotropy spectrum over the range @xmath8 .",
    "this shows that on average there are no large deviations of the intrinsic anisotropy spectrum from the predictions of standard cosmological models over this @xmath1-range . as discussed in paper iii",
    ", these measurements also support the gravitational instability paradigm for structure formation in the universe by providing the first direct measurements of the seeds from which present - day galaxy groups and clusters formed .",
    "in addition we report a detection of power , significant at the @xmath309 level , and @xmath5 above expected level of intrinsic anisotropy , at @xmath345 .",
    "higher signal - to - noise ratio and multi - frequency measurements will be vital in confirming this signal and , if confirmed , determining its origin .",

    "an accurate estimate of the noise in each visibility measurement is important for power - spectrum estimation . for the cbi we estimate the noise as follows . in each 16-min scan ( 8-min _",
    "lead _ and 8-min _ trail _ ) we form the differences of corresponding _ lead _ and _ trail _ integrations . with an integration time of 8.4 s , and allowing for slew and calibration time , there are usually about @xmath346 matched integrations in one scan .",
    "the mean differenced visibility for this scan @xmath347 and rms noise @xmath348 is estimated from the individual integrations in this scan @xmath349 : @xmath350 the mean and variance are estimated separately for real and imaginary parts of the visibility and the two variances , which should be equal if the instrument is working and correctly calibrated , are averaged together . in the complete dataset a visibility measurement at a particular @xmath16 point is usually constructed from many ( @xmath351 ) such scans taken under different conditions and with different baselines , so the noise may vary from scan to scan .",
    "if the noise on each scan were known _ a priori _ , the maximum likelihood estimator of the visibility could be formed by weighted average of the scans @xmath352 with weights @xmath353 , and this estimator would have a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath354 however , this is not the case : when the weights are estimated from the data , they have their own sampling distribution and the distribution of estimator @xmath355 is not gaussian . @xmath355 ( eq .  [ a1 ] ) remains an unbiased estimator of the visibility , but equation ( a2 ) gives a biased estimator of its variance .",
    "the bias depends on the values @xmath356 and @xmath351 and on the range of @xmath348 from scan to scan ; when data from different baselines are combined to form a single visibility estimate , the bias also depends on the relative correlator gains and antenna temperatures .",
    "we have chosen to use the estimator of equation ( a2 ) for the variance , but to correct it for the bias .",
    "we have found that , for large @xmath351 and equal @xmath348 , equation ( a2 ) underestimates the variance by a factor @xmath357 in simulations we find @xmath358 .",
    "we attribute the discrepancy to fluctuations in the noises and numbers of samples in the actual data , second - order corrections , and a known and understood @xmath212 overestimate of the noises in our pipeline . the simulations , and the @xmath359 noise correction which results from them , take all of these effects into account .",
    "we should therefore increase the variances computed using equation ( a2 ) by 1.06 .",
    "we actually used an an earlier , incorrect , estimate of 1.08 for the factor @xmath360 , so we have slightly overestimated the noise ( by 2% , comparable with the 2% uncertainty in the noise variance discussed in   [ subsubsec : chi2 ] ) .",
    "this overcorrection will have caused a small underestimate of the cmb band powers .",
