    "galaxy clusters are the largest virialized systems in the universe .",
    "each of them contains about @xmath9 m@xmath10 matter in the form of galaxies , hot gas and dark matter , and all these components have been studied in depth in optical , x - ray , and high - frequency ( @xmath11 ghz ) radio bands ( e.g. , sarazin & kempner 2000 ; rosati et al .",
    "2002 ; popesso et al .",
    "2004 ; ferrari et al .",
    "however , the physical conditions of magnetic fields and high energy particles , which permeate the extremely hot intra - cluster medium ( icm ) and have been playing important roles in the evolution of the icm ( e.g. , schekochihin et al .",
    "2005 ; lazarian 2006 ) , are still poorly understood . in the study of giant radio halos , which are always found in central regions of galaxy clusters and",
    "usually span on mpc scales , these lacked knowledges actually become crucial , because most of the emission of the radio halos can be ascribed to synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons moving in the @xmath12 g magnetic fields during or after a merger event ( e.g. , ferrari et al .",
    "2008 ; brunetti et al . 2008 ) . a variety of electron acceleration mechanisms and magnetic field distributions ( e.g. , enlin & gopal - krishna 2001 ; brunetti et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ; cassano & brunetti 2005 ) have been proposed to construct dynamic models to describe the behavior of relativistic electrons , and these models are to be testified by the upcoming facilities working in the low - frequency ( @xmath13 ) radio band , such as the 21 centimeter array ( 21cma ; peterson et al .",
    "2005 ) , the low frequency array ( lofar ; rttgering et al . 2003 ) , and the murchison wide - field array ( mwa ; morales & hewitt 2004 ) .    as of today ,",
    "only @xmath14 detections of radio halos in the ghz radio band have been reported ( e.g. , cassano et al .",
    "2006 ; giovannini et al .",
    "2009 ; brunetti et al . 2009 ) .",
    "however , since the characteristic decay time of synchrotron emission becomes significantly longer when the frequency goes lower ( for example , the synchrotron decay time at 150 mhz is approximately three times longer than that at 1.4 ghz ) , much more radio halos are expected at frequencies of a few hundred mhz .",
    "for example , cassano et al . (",
    "2010 ) estimated that more than 350 giant radio halos will be detected at 120 mhz by lofar in northern hemisphere and at galactic latitudes @xmath15 . and",
    "this expectation has been partially confirmed by recent giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) observations at 610 mhz ( e.g. , venturi et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "clearly , tight observational constrains on the formation and evolution of radio halos of galaxy clusters will be obtained in the next decade .    in most previous works on future low - frequency radio researches ,",
    "galaxy clusters were only treated as part of the useless contaminating foreground in front of the redshifted 21 cm emission signals that come from the cosmic reionization era , and were simply filtered out , together with the foreground emissions from our galaxy and extragalactic discrete sources ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2006 ; jeli et al .",
    "little effort has been made to study the feasibility of separating the cluster component from the luminous foreground .",
    "meanwhile , we find that in the existing numerical works models constructed for galaxy clusters are often oversimplified by either introducing a universal spectral index for the radio flux density of all cluster halos ( @xmath16 ; e.g. , gleser et al .",
    "2008 ; jeli et al .",
    "2008 ) , or , sometimes , by assuming a flat profile ( e.g. , jeli et al . 2008 ) for the spatial distributions of the radio surface brightness .",
    "similar oversimplifications are often found in the simulations of the emissions from our galaxy and extragalactic discrete sources , too .    in order to construct the contaminating foreground in front of the redshifted cosmic reionization signals with",
    "reasonably higher spatial and spectral accuracies , by fully taking into account the random variations of model parameters in the ranges allowed by the observations , and to investigate whether or not the cluster component ( or , at least , brightest clusters ) can be successfully disentangled from the bright foreground , we carry out monte - carlo simulations to model the galactic , cluster , discrete source , and the reionization components , with which we create the @xmath0 mhz radio sky with high fidelity as possible as we can",
    ". then we attempt to separate galaxy clusters and extract brightness temperature profiles and spectra from the brightest clusters , whose central brightness temperature are brighter than @xmath17 at @xmath18 , by introducing an approach designed on the basis of the independent component analysis ( ica ; comon 1994 ) and wavelet detection algorithm ( shensa 1992 ) .",
    "all the simulations are performed for the 21cma array that covers a field of view ( fov ) of about @xmath19 around the north celestial pole ( ncp ) , depending on the frequency . throughout the work we adopt @xmath20=71@xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ( e.g. , spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "in this section , we simulate the contributions that come from our galaxy , galaxy clusters , extragalactic discrete sources , cosmic reionization regions , and antenna array , respectively .",
    "all the simulated results are plotted in a circular fov with a @xmath1 radius around the ncp , as will be observed with the 21cma array , although in our simulations we firstly create corresponding images with a radius of @xmath26 , so that we are able to correct the boundary effect .",
    "we project the sky field to a flat plane using the azimuthal equidistant projection , and the obtained images are overlaid with grids of @xmath27 pixels , each pixel covering approximately a @xmath28 patch .      in the low - frequency radio band the emission of our galaxy is luminous and consists of synchrotron , free ",
    "free , and dust components ( e.g. , jones et al . 1998a ; platania et al . 2003 ; gleser et al . 2008 ) . of these , synchrotron emission is the dominating component , and is responsible for @xmath29 of the total galactic contamination in @xmath30 mhz . free - free emission from the diffuse ionized hydrogen in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is the next important contaminating source that contributes up to @xmath31 of the total galactic emission in @xmath30 mhz .",
    "dust emission is mainly restricted on the galactic plane and is usually negligible in @xmath30 mhz ( shaver et al .",
    "1999 ; platania et al .",
    "2003 ) , thus we do nt take it into account in this work .    the diffuse galactic synchrotron emission exhibits visible substructures in the total ( stokes i ) intensity map , which can be attributed to the inhomogeneous spatial distributions of the magnetic field ( e.g. , gaensler et al . 2001 ) and the ism ( e.g. , wieringa et al . 1993 ; gray et al . 1999 ; haverkorn et al . 2000 ) . as of today , the smallest substructures were resolved on the @xmath32 scales in the 1.4 ghz southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ; tucci et al .",
    "2002 ) , whereas in the low - resolution westerbork telescope ( wsrt ) observations @xmath33-scaled substructures at 150 mhz were reported as a common feature ( bernardi et al .",
    "2009 ) . in our simulation",
    ", we construct the two - dimensional galactic synchrotron map from observation results ( giardino et al .",
    "2002 ) directly , rather than the modeling of three - dimensional galactic structures ( e.g. , jeli et al .",
    "2008 ; sun et al .",
    "2008 ; sun & reich 2009 ) . by adopting the 21cma fov corresponding region of the brightness temperature image obtained at 408 mhz ( @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the two - dimensional position ; giardino et al .",
    "2002 ) , on which substructures with scales larger than @xmath36 are reproduced based on the 408 mhz all sky map ( haslam et al . 1982 ) and substructures with smaller scales ( but @xmath37 ) are simulated using the extrapolation of the galactic emission power - spectrum , we obtain the simulated galactic synchrotron emission images @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the frequency ; see an example @xmath40 in fig . 1_a _ ) as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the corresponding spatially varying synchrotron temperature spectral index ( fig .",
    "1_b _ ) calculated from the data of the 408 mhz and 1.4 ghz surveys ( giardino et al .",
    "thus we obtain the two - dimensional galactic synchrotron emission distribution @xmath38 , which ranges from mean value of @xmath43 k ( root mean square , rms hereafter , is @xmath44 k ) at 50 mhz to @xmath45 k ( rms is @xmath46 k ) at 200 mhz .    the galactic free - free emission component can not be directly observed with today s technology , because the galactic synchrotron component dominates the emission at all frequencies lower than 10 ghz , meanwhile the dust thermal emission becomes overwhelming at higher frequencies .",
    "however , hydrogen recombination lines ( @xmath47 line emission in particular ) provide a novel way to trace the free - free emission , since they originate in nearly the same region ( smoot 1998 ; reynolds & haffner 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , the brightness temperature distribution of the galactic free - free emission component at 30 ghz @xmath48 has been related to the @xmath47 intensity distribution @xmath49 ( finkbeiner 2003 ) in the form of @xmath50 where @xmath51 ( reynolds & haffner 2000 ) . using this relation , we derive the @xmath48 map of the 21cma fov from the corresponding region of @xmath49 survey image ( finkbeiner 2003 ) . by assuming that the brightness temperature spectrum of the galactic free - free emission follows a broken power - law shape , i.e. , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 at @xmath54 ( shaver 1999 ) or @xmath55 at @xmath56 ( bennett et al . 2003 ) is the free - free temperature spectral index",
    ", we theoretically obtain the two - dimensional galactic free - free emission distribution @xmath57 ( see an example @xmath58 in fig . 1_c _ ) , which ranges from mean value of @xmath59 k ( rms is @xmath60 k ) at 50 mhz to @xmath61 k ( rms is @xmath62 k ) at 200 mhz .",
    "the mass distribution of dark matter halos at a given redshift @xmath63 can be derived in the frame of the press - schechter model ( p - s model ; press & schechter 1974 ) , which has been extensively used in a variety of works ( e.g. , zhang & wu 2003 ; zentner et al .",
    "2005 ; fedeli et al .",
    "2006 ) since it was proposed .",
    "according to the p - s model , the initial perturbation of dark matter density at a given position @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 , is characterized by the density contrast @xmath66 with its probability @xmath67 following the gaussian distribution @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the variance in the density field and @xmath70 is the mass of dark halo . for a smoothed density field with a constant smoothing scale of @xmath71 ,",
    "inside which the total mass is @xmath70 , the variance in the density field is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the wave number , @xmath74 is the filter function for gaussian distribution , and @xmath75 is the primordial power - spectrum .",
    "based on these the dark halo mass function can be expressed as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the halo collapse time , @xmath78 is the normalized growth factor , and @xmath79 , in which @xmath80 is the total matter density .    assuming a mass fraction of 83% for dark matter ( e.g. , drexler 2007 ) and a lower mass limit of @xmath81 ( e.g. , holder et al .",
    "2001 ; voit 2005 ) for galaxy clusters , we calculate the number density distribution of galaxy clusters as a function of mass and redshift as @xmath82 ( @xmath83 is the cluster mass ) according to the p - s model , and the redshift distribution of galaxy clusters as @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . by examining the derived @xmath85",
    ", we find that galaxy clusters mainly distribute in the redshift range of @xmath86 ( e.g. , holder et al .",
    "2001 ) , which agrees with the observations , and 1084 cluster - level halos are expected in the 21cma fov . in the work that follows we assign random @xmath83 and @xmath63 to these 1084 clusters according to the @xmath87 distribution derived above , and",
    "determine the coordinates of the clusters on the sky plane ( i.e. , r.a . and",
    "dec ) according to the predictions of the theoretical cluster power spectrum in redshift range of @xmath86 ( majumdar & mohr 2004 ) .",
    "galaxy clusters that contain giant , diffuse radio halos are observed to exhibit a strong correlation between their x - ray and radio powers ( e.g. , enlin & rttgering 2002 ) , whereas those contain no or weak radio halos are found to disobey this relation , showing a significantly lower @xmath88 ratio ( e.g. , cassano 2009 ) , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the radio and x - ray luminosities for the clusters , respectively . according to the standard turbulent re - acceleration model , the primordial relativistic electron population accelerated in a merger event follows a power - law energy distribution @xmath91 , where the lorentz factor is @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and the electron energy spectral index is @xmath94 ( e.g. , ferrari et al . 2008 ) .",
    "these electrons lose energy not only via synchrotron emission when moving in the magnetic field ( @xmath95 ) , but also via inverse compton scattering through interacting with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "the latter process can be described in a similar way to the synchrotron emission if an equivalent magnetic field of @xmath96 g is introduced ( e.g. , parma et al .",
    "1999 ) , thus the electrons lose their energy on a time scale of @xmath97^{-1}~~\\rm{gyr}\\ ] ] ( ferrari et al . 2008 ) .",
    "taking @xmath98 ( around which most of the giant radio halos are found ) and the typical magnetic field strength @xmath99 g ( e.g. , kim et al .",

    "2006 ) for example , we find that the emission of the radio halo at 1.4 ghz will fade away after @xmath101 or @xmath102 gyr for @xmath3 g or @xmath100 g , respectively . at 100 mhz , the corresponding decay time will increase significantly to @xmath103 or @xmath104 gyr for @xmath3 g or @xmath100 g , respectively .",
    "this means that the spectrum of a radio halo will evolve into a soft state quickly , and finally fade away in the interval between two merger events ( typically 2.7 gyr ; mathiesen & evrard 2001 ) . as a result , typical radio temperature spectral indices of galaxy clusters are @xmath105 ( fig .",
    "3_a _ ) , which are significantly larger than those of other foreground components , including our galaxy (  2.1 ) and extragalactic discrete sources (  2.3 ) .",
    "in this work , we assign a random evolving time @xmath106 between 0 and 2.7 gyr for each cluster , and calculate the low - frequency flux density @xmath107 from its power density @xmath108 ( see details in appendix ) by assuming that each cluster owns a radio halo produced in the last merger and the initial 1.4 ghz power density @xmath109 obey the observed correlation between the 1.4 ghz power density and x - ray temperature @xmath110 . in order to derive the approximation of @xmath111 relation , using the data from cassano et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we repeatedly fit the observed data with maximum likelihood method and exclude the clusters fall out of the @xmath112 lower limit , as is shown in figure 3_b_. then we have @xmath113 as a comparison , on the figure we also superpose the data of three new cluster samples studied by giovannini et al .",

    "since all the calculations above are at a @xmath112 confidence level , the value of confusion noise should be 1/4 of the confusion level .",
    "in this section , after extremely bright discrete sources are masked , we apply the ica separation and wavelet detection algorithms to these maps to identify and study bright galaxy clusters , as described below .      according to our simulations , except for our galaxy , extragalactic discrete sources contribute most of the foreground in @xmath0 mhz in the 21cma fov . of these ,",
    "about @xmath210 sources are extremely bright , and should be discarded before identifying and analyzing weaker components . here",
    "we introduce a masking method , which has been widely used in the cmb separation works ( e.g. , bennett et al . 2003 ; leach et al .",
    "2008 ) , to exclude map pixels that contain extremely bright discrete sources . to be specific ,",
    "we adopt a brightness temperature criterion of @xmath211 in all selected frequency channels to exclude circular regions with a radius of one fwhm ( @xmath183 ) centered at all extremely bright sources . in the analysis that follows ,",
    "if a pixel is masked in any one frequency channel , it is also masked in all other channels . as a result , about @xmath212 of the 21cma fov",
    "is masked .",
    "as a blind signal separation method , ica only assumes that the maps of original celestial and noise components are independent from each other in frequency space , and no more than one of them is gaussian .",
    "these assumptions are applicable to our case .",
    "thus , in terms of the ica algorithm , the relation between the mixed maps obtained in different frequency channels , all of which have been whitened ( hyvrinen 1999 ) as a pre - procession , and original component maps can be expressed as @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the vector constructed by the mixed maps at @xmath215 layers of frequency channels ( @xmath216 ) , @xmath217 is the vector constructed by @xmath182 ( @xmath182 is the number of celestial components , @xmath218 ) layers of original celestial maps , and @xmath219 is an @xmath220 dimensional transition matrix . since from equation ( 17 ) we have @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the inverse of @xmath219 , the original celestial maps can be derived when @xmath222 is available . in order to determine @xmath222",

    "when the maximum is found , we have @xmath232 .    as shown in equation ( 17 ) , the ica algorithm reads in and treats the input mixed maps as vectors , the elements of which are related to the pixels of the corresponding maps . the way to establish the mapping between a map and its corresponding vector",
    "( e.g. , row - by - row , column - by - column , or even randomly ) is arbitrary , but once determined for one map , it should keep the same for all the maps . thus the spatial relations among pixels ( i.e. , image domain features ) are broken and are not considered by the ica algorithm .",
    "this is different from the traditional way to detect discrete sources on a map , for which the confusion noise is essentially important .",
    "ica has been proved to be an effective separation technique in astronomical imaging analysis works , to reconstruct the sources confused by other components or even sunk into the confusion noise . in de",

    "all of them are bright enough for a direct model study to determine their spectral properties .",
    "we ascribe the failure of detection of the remaining 14 clusters ( 11 clusters if @xmath3 g , or three clusters if @xmath4 g ) to the following three reasons .",
    "first , six out of the 14 undetected clusters exhibit relatively flat spectra , which makes it difficult to disentangle them from the galaxy component , the spectral index of which ranges from @xmath284 to 2.9 .",
    "second , five out of the 14 clusters are faint and less extended , either embeded in brighter clusters or overlapped by bright discrete sources . and third , three out of the 14 clusters are less extended and are masked along with adjacent bright discrete sources .",
    "we also find that 10 ( if @xmath3 g ) or four discrete sources ( if @xmath4 g ) are misidentified as galaxy clusters",
    ". this mistake can be corrected by examining the brightness temperature profiles and spectra of the sources .    for the cosmological 21 cm signals survey projects such as the 21cma ,",
    "although our separation approach can only extract bright clusters , which are more than two orders of magnitude brighter than the cosmological 21 cm signals , from the images , the analysis on the cluster component can deepen our understanding on cluster characters ( e.g. , brightness , shape , spatial distribution , spectrum ) in the low - frequency radio sky , the information of which is valuable when detecting the cosmological 21 cm signals in both image and frequency spaces .      in the frame of the most popular model for cluster radio halos , i.e. , the turbulent re - acceleration model ( e.g. , ferrari et al .",
    "2008 ) , every cluster should host a radio halo after experiencing a major merger .",
    "however , since the halo s radio emission decays quickly as the relativistic electrons lose their energy , radio halos are expected in only about @xmath285 of massive ( @xmath286 ) clusters and in @xmath287 of less massive ( @xmath288 ) clusters ( cassano et al .",
    "2006 ) , in other words , in the whole sky @xmath289 50 clusters are found to host a bright radio halo at 1.4 ghz according to the obsevational works ( cassano et al .",
    "2006 ; giovannini et al . 2009 ; brunetti et al . 2009 ) . using this halo number density",
    "we estimate that @xmath290 radio halo shall appear at 1.4 ghz in the 21cma fov , which is consistent with the 1.4 ghz detection of abell 2294 in this field . on the other hand , by calculating the evolution of the power density @xmath291 of cluster radio halos ( see appendix ) , we find that among 1084 simulated clusters only one ( if @xmath3 g ) or none ( if @xmath4 g ) cluster ( fig .",
    "10 ) is brighter than the standard vla detection threshold at 1.4 ghz , given an intergration time of @xmath292 hrs ( giovannini et al .",
    "this shows that our work is nicely consistent with current observations performed at higher frequencies , and the prediction for the apperence of more than one dozen low - frequency cluster radio halos in the 21cma fov is reliable .",
    "this work is accomplished based on the predictions of the standard turbulent re - acceleration model , which assumes that most cluster radio halos are formed in major merger events .",
    "however , in alternative models ( e.g. , the magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) model ; brunetti et al .",
    "2004 ; cassano 2009 ) , some radio halos , although relatively small and weak , can also be produced on cluster scales via minor mergers , so that much more halos are expected in the low - frequency radio sky .",
    "the survey of galaxy clusters with upcoming facilities working in the band of a few hundred of mhz will help distinguish these models .",
    "by carrying out monte - carlo simulations we model the foreground of the cosmological reionization signals , including emissions from our galaxy , galaxy clusters , and extragalactic discrete sources ( i.e. , star - forming galaxies , radio - quiet agns , and radio - loud agns ) .",
    "as an improvement of previous works , we consider in detail not only random variations of morphological and spectroscopic parameters within the ranges allowed by multi - band observations , but also evolution of radio halos in galaxy clusters , assuming that relativistic electrons are re - accelerated in the icm in merger events and lose energy via both synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering with cmb photons . with these",
    "we create the fake @xmath0 mhz sky as will be observed with the 21cma array .",
    "we show that about @xmath2 ( 37 out of 48 if @xmath3 g , or 15 out of 18 if @xmath4 g ) of the clusters with a central brightness temperature of @xmath5 at 65 mhz can be successfully disentangled from the fake sky maps , if an ica+wavelet detection algorithm is applied .",

    "<S> in this work we simulate the @xmath0 mhz radio sky that is constrained in the field of view ( @xmath1 radius ) of the 21 centimeter array ( 21cma ) , a low - frequency radio interferometric array constructed in the remote area of xinjiang , china , by carrying out monte - carlo simulations to model the strong contaminating foreground of the redshifted cosmological reionization signals , including emissions from our galaxy , galaxy clusters , and extragalactic discrete sources ( i.e. , star - forming galaxies , radio - quiet agns , and radio - loud agns ) . as an improvement of previous works , we consider in detail not only random variations of morphological and spectroscopic parameters within the ranges allowed by multi - band observations , but also evolution of radio halos in galaxy clusters , assuming that relativistic electrons are re - accelerated in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) in merger events and lose energy via both synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons . by introducing a new approach designed on the basis of independent component analysis ( ica ) and wavelet detection algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , we prove that , with a cumulative observation of one month with the 21cma array , about @xmath2 of galaxy clusters ( 37 out of 48 clusters assuming a mean magnetic field of @xmath3 g in the icm , or 15 out of 18 clusters assuming @xmath4 g ) with central brightness temperatures of @xmath5 at 65 mhz can be safely identified and separated from the overwhelmingly bright foreground . by examining the brightness temperature images and spectra extracted from these identified clusters , we find that the morphological and spectroscopic distortions are extremely small as compared to the input simulated clusters , and the reduced @xmath6 of brightness temperature profiles and spectra are controlled to be @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . these results robustly indicate that in the near future a sample of dozens of bright galaxy clusters will be disentangled from the foreground in 21cma observations , the study of which will greatly improve our knowledge about cluster merger rates , electron acceleration mechanisms in cluster radio halos , and magnetic field in the icm . </S>"
