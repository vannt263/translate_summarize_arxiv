    "for nearly 100 years , the analysis of diffraction patterns of solids has been an essential tool for studying solids , since the diffraction pattern of a solid is essentially the ( squared ) fourier transform of the set of atomic positions .",
    "classical crystallography considered periodic structures , whose diffraction patterns consist entirely of sharp bragg peaks .",
    "the fourier transform of such a periodic set can be computed from the relevant unit cell .",
    "the discovery of quasicrystals showed that discrete diffraction patterns are associated not only with periodic structures but also with a large family of solids that have no discrete translation symmetry  quasicrystals .",
    "this fact was incorporated into a new definition of  crystal \" proposed in 1992 by the commission on aperiodic crystals established by the international union of crystallography : a crystal is defined to be any solid with an essentially discrete diffraction pattern .",
    "diffraction patterns for periodic and aperiodic crystals differ in substantial ways  for instance , the diffraction patterns of quasicrystals may exhibit  forbidden symmetry \" . it is therefore illuminating to consider a model that interpolates between periodic and aperiodic structures , and observe how the diffraction pattern changes .",
    "we consider such a one - parameter family of structures in this paper .",
    "specifically , we consider a fixed ( fibonacci ) sequence of two types of `` atoms '' , and vary the amount of space around each type of atom , while keeping the overall density fixed .",
    "the control parameter @xmath0 is the ratio of the two allowed distances between nearest neighbors . in all cases ,",
    "the diffraction pattern is discrete , and the locations of the bragg peaks are independent of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the _ intensities _ of the peaks are @xmath0-dependent .",
    "when @xmath0 is rational , the intensities form a periodic pattern , while when @xmath0 is irrational , the diffraction pattern is aperiodic .",
    "we compute this diffraction pattern in two independent but equivalent ways : a ) by recovering periodicity going to higher dimension ( the  cut and project method \" deeply discussed in many papers : @xcite ) ; b)using the concept of the reference lattice .",
    "these results are in accordance with the ergodic theory of tiling spaces .",
    "it is known that the bragg peaks of a tiling @xmath1 occur at eigenvalues of the generator of translations on the hull of @xmath1 ( i.e. , the space of all tilings in the same local isomorphism class as @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "it is also known @xcite that the hulls of modified fibonacci chains with the same average spacing are topologically conjugate , hence that their generators of translations have the same spectral decomposition .",
    "the question of when and how such a modification affects the dynamical spectrum was addressed for one dimensional patterns in @xcite , and for higher dimensional patterns in @xcite .",
    "( it should be noted that for a substitution tiling whose substitution matrix has two of more eigenvalues greater than 1 , a generic change in tile length will destroy the bragg peaks altogether , in sharp contrast to the behavior of modified fibonacci chains , other pisot substitutions , and other sturmian sequences . )",
    "ergodic theory says nothing , however , about the intensities of the bragg peaks .",
    "although the spectrum of the generator of translations is complicated , for special values of the control parameter some of the peaks may have intensity zero , resulting in a simpler diffraction pattern .",
    "the calculations in this paper demonstrate that this does in fact happen .",
    "the properties of fibonacci sequences have already been thoroughly studied ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they are sequences of two elements @xmath2 and @xmath3 obtained from a substitution rule : @xmath4 let @xmath5 be the population vector , where @xmath6 tells how many elements of type @xmath7 are among the first @xmath8 terms of the sequence . of course ,",
    "there are an uncountably infinite number of fibonacci sequences , but all have the same local properties and the same diffraction pattern .",
    "it is easy to see that every fibonacci sequence has @xmath10 for definiteness , we will work with the sequence ( @xcite ) @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the nearest integer function : if @xmath13 and @xmath14 then : @xmath15    now pick two positive numbers ( also called @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) that determine the space between each `` @xmath2 '' or `` @xmath3 '' atom and its predecessor .",
    "that is , the atomic positions are given by @xmath16 we call the sequence @xmath17 a _ modified fibonacci chain_. if @xmath18 , then the atoms are equally spaced , and this is simply a periodic array . if @xmath19 , then the atomic positions are those obtained from the canonical `` cut and project '' method . by varying the ratio @xmath20 ,",
    "we interpolate between these two cases .",
    "note that the average atomic spacing is @xmath21 .",
    "we will keep this average spacing fixed and consider the one - parameter family @xmath22 depending on the control parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the modified fibonacci chain can be obtained by a `` cut and project '' method with a nonstandard projection . from this construction",
    "we can compute the diffraction pattern .",
    "let @xmath24 be the 2 dimensional square lattice with spacing @xmath25 .",
    "the vorono cell of each lattice point is a square .",
    "let @xmath26 be the line @xmath27 through the origin , making an angle @xmath28 with the @xmath29-axis .",
    "let @xmath7 be the subset of @xmath24 whose vorono cells are cut by @xmath26 .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. , @xcite ) that @xmath30 where @xmath31 are population vectors given by ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath32 be the line through the origin making an angle @xmath33 with the @xmath29-axis , and define @xmath34 to be the orthogonal projection onto @xmath35 .",
    "finally , let @xmath36 be the projection of @xmath7 onto @xmath35 : @xmath37 the set @xmath36 is then a modified fibonacci chain ; the procedure was presented in the figure [ fig : projection ] .",
    "the two distances are @xmath38 their sequence is fully determined by @xmath7 and does not depend on @xmath39 .",
    "the average distance between nearest neighbors in @xmath36 is @xmath40 to keep this average spacing constant we take @xmath41 the angle @xmath39 , the displacement parameter @xmath23 of ( [ eq : a ] ) and the ratio @xmath42 are related by @xmath43    we assume that every point of the set @xmath36 is an atom with scattering power equal to unity .",
    "our aim is to calculate the diffraction pattern of such a structure .",
    "we begin by calculating the 2-dimensional diffraction pattern of @xmath7 .",
    "the diffraction pattern of @xmath36 is then a section of the diffraction pattern of @xmath7 along the direction @xmath35 ( figure [ fig : recspace ] ) .    to get the diffraction pattern of @xmath7 we note that @xmath7 is @xmath24 times the characteristic function of a strip of width @xmath44 around @xmath45 .",
    "the fourier transform of a product is the convolution of the fourier transforms , and the fourier transform of a lattice is the reciprocal lattice .",
    "the diffraction pattern of @xmath7 in 2d has normalized intensity @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 label points of the reciprocal lattice to @xmath24 . along the direction @xmath32",
    ", the peaks can be observed at positions @xmath49 note that these positions are independent of @xmath39 ( or @xmath23 or @xmath0 ) .",
    "their intensities are @xmath50 after simplifying and rewriting in terms of @xmath23 we obtain @xmath51",
    "the concept of a reference lattice has previously been proposed in @xcite .",
    "suppose we have a 1 dimensional delone set @xmath52 .",
    "its points represent atoms , whose scattering instensities are equal to unity . with some appropriate assumptions on the sequence @xmath53",
    "we get the following expression for the structure factor : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the probability distribution of distances @xmath56 from the atoms to reference lattice positions @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "that is , @xmath59    we call the series @xmath60 the _ displacements sequence _ of @xmath61 ( induced by the reference lattice with period @xmath62 ) .",
    "any series @xmath63 such that @xmath64 will be called an _ unreduced displacements sequence _ ( of @xmath65 ) .",
    "[ theo : sumofdis ] let @xmath66 be a sum of two real series . if @xmath67 is a displacements sequence of @xmath68 induced by a reference lattice , then @xmath69 is an unreduced displacements sequence of @xmath65 induced by the same lattice .",
    "let @xmath62 be the period of the reference lattice .",
    "we have to show that @xmath70    note that for any real number @xmath71 , @xmath72 , since @xmath73 is an integer .",
    "we can write the right hand side of ( [ eq : topr1 ] ) as @xmath74 which is the left hand side .    the quantity @xmath55 may be viewed as a probability distribution for an _ average unit cell_. the structure factor for the scattering vector @xmath75 is just the first fourier mode of this distribution .",
    "unfortunately , for each scattering vector we get , in principle , a different average unit cell and a different distribution",
    ". however , the structure factor for @xmath76 can be computed from the reference lattice for @xmath75 ; it is the @xmath8-th fourier mode of the distribution @xmath55 .",
    "thus , a single average unit cell is sufficient to analyze structures whose scattering occurs at multiples of a fixed scattering vector @xmath77 .",
    "this situation includes , but is not limited to , the case where the original point pattern was periodic with period @xmath78 .    for modulated structures ( including quasicrystals )",
    ", there are usually two periods , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which may be incommensurate . using two reference lattices ,",
    "the first one having periodicity @xmath79 and the second having periodicity @xmath80 , the structure factor for the sum of two scattering vectors @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be expressed by : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the shortest distances of the atomic position from the appropriate points of two reference lattices and @xmath86 is the corresponding probability distribution , which thus describes a _ two dimensional _ average unit cell .",
    "likewise , the structure factor for a linear combination @xmath87 is given by the @xmath88 fourier mode of @xmath86 .",
    "this means that the average unit cell , calculated for the wave vectors of the main structure and its modulation , can be used to calculate the peak intensities of any of the main reflections and its satellites of arbitrary order . using ( [ eq:2pfac ] ) and its generalization",
    ", it is possible to calculate the intensities of all peaks observed in the diffraction patterns .",
    "let @xmath89 , the average spacing between atoms in a modified fibonacci chain , and let @xmath90 .",
    "the positions of atoms in our chain are : @xmath91+mb \\nonumber \\\\ & = ( a - b ) \\frac{m}{\\tau } + mb + ( a - b ) \\big ( \\frac { 1}{2 } -   \\left\\ { \\frac{m}{\\tau}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}\\big ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = ma+{u_{\\scriptscriptstyle{0}}}m(ma ) , \\label{eq : xmfin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is a periodic function with period @xmath80 and @xmath93 here @xmath94 = \\| x - \\frac{1}{2 } \\|$ ] is the greatest integer function and @xmath95 $ ] is the fractional part of @xmath29 .    when @xmath96 , the modified fibonacci chain is thus an incommensurately modulated structure .",
    "a similar derivation for @xmath97 can be found in @xcite .",
    "we are going to construct a two dimensional average unit cell based on the two natural periodicities for @xmath98 : @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "for the scattering vector @xmath99 , it is obvious that the series @xmath100 is an unreduced displacements sequence of @xmath98 induced by the reference lattice with period @xmath79 .",
    "next we consider the ( one dimensional ) average unit cell for the scattering vector @xmath101 .",
    "the series @xmath102 is an ( unreduced ) displacement sequence of @xmath103 induced by a reference lattice with period @xmath80 . using theorem [ theo : sumofdis ]",
    "we immediately get that the series @xmath104 is an unreduced displacements sequence of @xmath98 induced by a lattice with period @xmath80 , where @xmath105    by kronecker s theorem ( see @xcite ) , the series @xmath106 is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath107 $ ] . as pointed out by elser ( @xcite ,",
    "for a more precise discussion see also @xcite ) the uniformity of this distribution is crucial for our deliberations .",
    "likewise , the series @xmath108 is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath109 $ ] .    the structure factor ( see ( [ eq:2pfac ] ) ) is @xmath110 the unreduced displacements sequences @xmath106 and @xmath108 can be used to calculate @xmath86 . however , this can not be done directly because their terms may lie outside the average unit cell ( i.e. : @xmath111 or @xmath112 ) .",
    "such a situation is shown in figure [ fig : avcell1 ] .",
    "we have to reduce the series to the interior of the cell .",
    "the probability function @xmath86 is nonzero only along segments with slope @xmath113 ( as a result of the strong correlation between @xmath106 and @xmath108 given by ( [ eq : v_prim ] ) ) and has constant value .",
    "this last fact follows from the uniformity of the marginal distributions .    the formula ( [ eq : factor ] ) is invariant under the changes @xmath114 where @xmath115 are arbitrary integers",
    "likewise , the formula does not change if we use @xmath116 instead of @xmath86 and we change the area of integration from @xmath117$],@xmath118 $ ] to @xmath119 $ ] , @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "that is , we are free to integrate a part of distribution in the neighboring unit cells .    for integers",
    "@xmath120 we compute the location @xmath121 , the structure factor @xmath122 and the normalized intensity @xmath123 of the corresponding peak : @xmath124 where @xmath125    the integers @xmath126 and @xmath127 label the main reflection and its satellites , respectively .",
    "equations ( [ eq : fink ] , [ eq : fin_w ] ) can be used to calculate the positions and intensities of all peaks .    the correspondence with the previous 2 dimensional calculation is given by @xmath128 by equations ( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq : fink ] ) , the peaks are located at @xmath129 likewise , substituting ( [ eq : m_to_n ] ) into ( [ eq : fin_w ] ) and simplifying yields ( [ eq : intens_2d ] ) .",
    "it must be noted that the 2d approach presented here is not new and has been already used to describe the transformation between quasiperiodic and periodic structures .",
    "please refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the deformation rule in physical space changes only the amplitude of modulation ( equation ( [ eq : xmfin ] ) ) .",
    "positions of peaks do not depend on the parameter @xmath23 ; only their intensities vary . using equations ( [ eq : fink ] ) and ( [ eq : fin_w ] ) we can easily build envelope functions , which go through the satellite reflections of the same order ( indexed by @xmath127 ) .",
    "the shift of the envelope functions is @xmath130 , as given by ( [ eq : fin_w ] ) .",
    "the set of positions of bragg peaks is always periodic , since the spectrum of a one - dimensional dynamical system is an abelian group . by a",
    "_ commensurate _",
    "diffraction pattern we mean a pattern in which the amplitudes are periodic as well .",
    "however , aside from the special case @xmath18 , the bragg peaks are described by two incommensurate periods , and should not be confused with the diffraction of a periodic crystal . for our diffraction patterns ,",
    "one period ( of length @xmath130 ) is connected with envelope functions , while the second , with period @xmath77 , is associated with peaks ascribed to each envelope function . this behavior is characteristic of modulated crystals and was discussed in @xcite . only the first periodicity could assure equality of intensities .",
    "it is convenient to describe our results in terms of the ratio @xmath42 .",
    "when @xmath0 is rational , say equal to @xmath131 , then every atomic location @xmath132 is a multiple of @xmath133 .",
    "plane waves whose frequencies are multiples of @xmath134 have value 1 at each atomic position , and the entire diffraction pattern is periodic with period @xmath134 .",
    "conversely , if the diffraction pattern is periodic , then the underlying periods @xmath77 and @xmath130 must be commensurate .",
    "a simple algebraic calculation then shows that @xmath0 must be rational .",
    "thus , the pattern is commensurate if and only if @xmath0 is rational , which corresponds to projecting the set @xmath7 onto a rational direction ( @xmath135 ; see ( [ eq : abang ] ) ) .",
    "figure [ fig : modfib0]a shows the diffraction pattern of an unmodified fibonacci chain .",
    "the pattern is clearly non - periodic , as @xmath20 equals to @xmath136 . for @xmath97",
    "our approach is identical with that presented in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : modfib0]b shows the pattern for @xmath137 ( corresponding to the average unit cell presented in figure [ fig : avcell1 ] )",
    ". as we can see , analytical calculations of envelope functions are in full agreement with numerical calculations of the diffraction pattern .",
    "figures [ fig : modfib5 ] and [ fig : modfib6 ] show diffractions patterns for @xmath0 equal to @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively .",
    "the regular series of peaks are clearly visible , but the diffraction patterns are still quasicrystaline .",
    "it is significant that for any value of @xmath23 except @xmath140 ( discussed below ) the structure is not periodic in physical space , but may have periodic diffraction patterns .    for @xmath141",
    "one gets fully periodic structure with @xmath142 , hence @xmath18 .",
    "our deformed fibonacci chain is then simply a lattice , and its diffraction pattern is the reciprocal lattice , with period @xmath143 . at this special value of @xmath0 ,",
    "all the other bragg peaks have intensity zero .",
    "it must be also noted that the amplitude of each peak is a continuous function of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , it is infinitely differentiable .",
    "as @xmath0 is varied , there is no phase transition between commensurate and incommensurate diffraction patterns ; the evolution is smooth . as such , with measurement apparatus of fixed accuracy , it is impossible to determine whether a given pattern is precisely periodic .    finally is may be noted that our analysis of the transition quasiperiodic - periodic ( commensurate - incommensurate ) is based on the explicit knowledge of the structure factor .",
    "it has been already shown ( @xcite ) that the method advertised ( average unit cell ) can give the factor for higher dimensional structures and therefore there are ( in general ) no obstacles to repeat similar analysis in the latter case .",
    "such calculations have not been undertaken so far but it seems that they might be based on analytical expressions for the coordinates of quasiperiodic lattices , derived from periodic or quasiperiodic grids ( as given for example in @xcite ) .",
