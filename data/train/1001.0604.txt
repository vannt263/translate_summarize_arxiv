    "transiting extrasolar planets provide unparalleled opportunities for detailed study of the physical characteristics of distant solar systems .",
    "since the first transiting planet detection a decade ago , ground - based surveys such as tres , hat , and super - wasp @xcite and the spaceborne telescope corot @xcite have located more than 50 transiting planets , spanning a large range in size and mass . with the advent of nasa s _ kepler mission _ , we have a new and extraordinarily sensitive tool for studying transiting planets .",
    "_ kepler _ has enough sensitivity to detect earth - size planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun - like stars during its planned 3.5-year mission @xcite . the first science data to return after _",
    "kepler s _ launch in mar 2009 were time series from a 9.7-day commissioning run , followed after a 1.6-day gap by a 33.5-day science run . here",
    "we describe the transiting planet kepler-4b , one of several transiting planets discovered during these first two observing intervals .",
    "observations of the _ kepler _ target field commenced 1 may 2009 ; the data that we describe here are long cadence ( lc ) photometry , which correspond to integration times of 29.426 minutes . for a full description of the _ kepler _ field of view ,",
    "observing modes , and data processing pipeline , see @xcite . for _ kepler",
    "_ target stars brighter than @xmath16 , the rms photometric precision attained for relative flux time series is typically better than @xmath17 per 29-minute integration @xcite .",
    "we detrended photometry from the mission data reduction pipeline and searched it for significant transit - like events using the procedures described by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "one of the transiting planet candidates identified by the process just described was the star we now term kepler-4 .",
    "this star is uncommonly bright by _ kepler _ standards .",
    "its kepler magnitude ( ab magnitude averaged over the @xmath18 bandpass ) is @xmath19 .",
    "characteristics of this star are given in table 1 ; briefly , it is a somewhat metal - rich ( @xmath20 = { \\ensuremath{+0.17\\pm0.06}}$ ] ) star of nearly solar temperature ( @xmath21 k ) , evidently seen near the end of its main - sequence lifetime , as explained below .",
    "figure 1 shows the light curve for kepler-4 , folded with a period of @xmath22 d. since the transit signal was clear , we proceeded with follow - up observations as described in @xcite .",
    "experience with both ground- and space - based transit observations shows that a fairly large fraction of events that resemble planetary transits are actually caused by eclipses involving only stars , or eclipses with properties that are significantly confused by diluting light from one or more stellar companions , either physical or projected .",
    "for this reason , we designed our follow - up observations to determine whether the light curve dips can be ascribed to a transiting planet ; if not , what eclipsing star or other process might be responsible for them ; and if so , what the properties of the host star and its planet might be .",
    "ground - based visible - light speckle imaging from the wiyn telescope , nir adaptive - optics imaging from the mt .",
    "palomar 5 m telescope , and also with the nirc2 camera on the keck telescope all show kepler-4 as an isolated star , apart from a neighbor that is 3.5 magnitudes fainter at a distance of 11.9@xmath23 .",
    "we estimate that this star contributes 2@xmath242% to the flux we measure for kepler-4 , which dilutes the transit by a factor of 1.02@xmath240.02 .",
    "we take this dilution and its uncertainty into account in computing the the planetary radius @xmath25 and its probable errors .",
    "limits on nearby companions are described by @xcite ; the imagery rules out background eclipsing binaries that might simulate the observed transits , up to a magnitude difference of 9.8 in h band , for companions between 0.12 and 3.0 arcsec from kepler-4 .",
    "we have also searched for motion of the image centroid that is correlated with the transits , finding no such motion with a limit of @xmath26 arcsec .",
    "two reconnaissance spectra obtained with the tres spectrograph on the 1.5-m tillinghast reflector at the whipple observatory showed a velocity variation of less than 150 m / s over five days .",
    "accordingly we obtained radial velocity measurements with the hires spectrograph on the keck i telescope @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the radial velocity data for kepler-4 , folded with the transit period and shifted so that transit center occurs at zero phase . assuming zero eccentricity",
    ", we obtained a radial velocity variation with phase that is consistent with the observed light curve , with a reflex velocity amplitude @xmath27 of @xmath28 and velocity residuals of only 3.6 @xmath6 .",
    "we also performed a fit in which we allowed the eccentricity @xmath29 to float .",
    "this gave @xmath30 and @xmath31 ms@xmath32 ; the reduced @xmath33 improved only slightly .",
    "finally , a monte carlo bootstrap ( described below ) that simultaneously fits all photometry and rv values , and that is consistent with stellar evolution models , gives @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "there is thus only marginal evidence for a noncircular orbit . in the analysis",
    "below , we do however account throughout for the possible range of @xmath29 and @xmath36 in our estimates of stellar and planetary parameters and their uncertainties .",
    "given the integration times of the spectra and kepler-4 s brightness , @xmath37 , and slow rotation ( @xmath38 ) , the residuals are consistent with expectations .",
    "we also used the hires spectra to search for variations in the shapes of line bisectors ; the component of the bisector span that is in phase with the orbital period has amplitude @xmath39 ( with uncertainty estimated from the bisector scatter ) , offering no support for the presence of a blended eclipsing binary star",
    ".    we can reject many photometric blend scenarios , but not all .",
    "kepler-4b s long transit duration rules out hierarchical triple systems in which the primary of the eclipsing pair contributes less than about 25% of the system luminosity .",
    "near - twin star systems permitted by this constraint would lead to errors in the planet radius and mass by factors of a few  these would be serious , but not large enough that transits by stars could be confused with those by planets . moreover , virtually all transiting planet parameter estimates are vulnerable to confusion of this sort . an unresolved background eclipsing binary star",
    "might accurately simulate the transit light curve , but such a system would not likely produce the very small observed rv variation , nor the small line bisector variation .",
    "the most plausible remaining blend scenario involves an unresolved background transiting jupiter - size planet .",
    "such a blend could be consistent with all current observations , though the required coincidence in apparent position is very unlikely a priori .",
    "thus , although some kinds of confusing photometric blends are possible , there is no evidence for them . in",
    "what follows , we assume that the observed light curve results from transits by a rather small extrasolar planet across the face of a normal , single , sun - like star .",
    "the _ kepler _ photometer produces a light curve that implies the planetary radius in units of the host star radius .",
    "likewise , groundbased followup doppler spectroscopy yields the mass of the planet in terms of the host star s mass . thus , having accurate values for the host star s fundamental parameters  mass , radius , effective temperature , and composition  will be essential to carrying out _",
    "kepler s _ mission to characterize planets circling distant stars .",
    "but it is also possible to reverse this logical flow , and use transiting planets as probes of their host stars . @xcite",
    "derived expressions relating the light curve to the mean density @xmath40 of a transiting planet s host star .",
    "they showed that @xmath40 can be expressed in terms of the planet s orbital period , the fractional flux obstructed by the planet , and two different measures of the transit duration .",
    "all of these quantities are directly measurable from the light curve , and their interpretation depends only on newtonian mechanics and geometry .",
    "the method we use ( henceforth , the @xmath40 method ) for estimating stellar radii and other parameters is an implementation of that described by @xcite and subsequently used by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this technique has become the most trusted way of obtaining information about transiting planets host stars , as illustrated by @xcite .",
    "the basis for the @xmath40 method is that , although stellar models are ordinarily taken to depend on 5 parameters \\{mass , age , metallicity , initial helium abundance , and mixing length } = @xmath41 , y_0 , \\alpha \\}$ ] , the last two of these do not vary much among stars , and for practical purposes are often taken as known . in particular , the much - used yonsei - yale ( henceforth yy )",
    "model grid @xcite uses specified values for the mixing length and for the initial helium abundance . in this approximation ,",
    "stars are described by a 3-dimensional grid of models , parameterized by mass , age , and metallicity .",
    "every transiting planet discovered by _",
    "kepler _ and followed up with reconnaisance spectroscopy has available a transit light curve that constrains @xmath40 , and also spectrographic estimates of @xmath37 and @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "moreover , for main - sequence stars , the problem of inferring stellar structure parameters from the 3 observables @xmath43\\}$ ] is usually well - posed , allowing precise conclusions without important degeneracies .",
    "thus , the quantities that we may readily observe usually suffice to isolate a single set of model parameters \\{mass , age , metallicity } ; from these , we may compute any other global property ( e.g. radius , luminosity , or surface gravity ) .",
    "we implement the @xmath40 method by searching a precomputed grid of models ( interpolated from the yy models ) to find the one that best matches the observations in a @xmath33 sense .",
    "the optimization problem involves interpolating within the given model grid and performing a conventional ( eg `` amoeba '' ) hill - climbing optimization search .",
    "estimating errors and verifying that the search has converged to the global optimum is done using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) process . to allow for possible systematic errors in the spectrographic analysis",
    ", we took uncertainties in @xmath42 $ ] to be the larger of 0.06 dex and the quoted value , and twice the quoted value for @xmath37 . for @xmath40",
    ", we used a parameterization of the ( often highly asymmetric ) error distribution estimated from a jack - knife analysis of the photometry .",
    "not all parameter choices @xmath44 \\}$ ] permitted by a given @xmath40 are consistent with the photometry , and vice versa . moreover , in the light curve analysis , the estimated @xmath40 depends somewhat on the initial guess for @xmath45 @xcite and on the range of orbital eccentricity allowed by the observations . to account for the different information supplied by these two kinds of model fitting",
    ", we iterated the solution by putting the mcmc probability distributions back into the light curve analysis .",
    "the most likely parameter values and uncertainty distributions we report below are the result of this once - iterated fit .",
    "@xcite has tested the @xmath40 method against a sample of 169 stars ( mostly members of eclipsing binaries taken from the compilation by @xcite ) that have accurately known masses and radii .",
    "this comparison shows that the method s systematic errors do not exceed 2 - 3% in radius , and about 6 - 9% in mass .",
    "random errors appear to arise about equally from uncertainties in the estimated stellar @xmath37 and metallicity , and from uncertainties in the masses and radii inferred for the eclipsing binary components using traditional ( but largely model - independent ) techniques .",
    "systematic errors arise mostly because rapidly - rotating and hence magnetically active stars are seen to have larger radii than slowly - rotating stars with otherwise similar properties ( eg , @xcite ) .",
    "the sample of eclipsing binary stars consists almost entirely of such fast rotators ; this causes an excess of up to several percent in the actual radii of stars of sub - solar mass , relative to the yy models . on the other hand ,",
    "the host stars of confirmed transiting planets found by _",
    "kepler _ are mostly slow rotators ( if only because it is difficult to measure precise radial velocities of rapidly - rotating stars ) . errors in these estimates should therefore be dominated by measurement errors , especially in @xmath42 $ ] and in @xmath40 .",
    "simultaneous fits to the transits of kepler-4b and to the rv data ( allowing nonzero eccentricity ) yield the ratio of orbital semimajor axis @xmath46 to stellar radius @xmath47 , namely @xmath48 , which with the orbital period gives @xmath49 .",
    "this is a low value , roughly 1/3 that of the sun , suggesting that kepler-4 must have evolved considerably away from the zero - age main sequence . applying",
    "the @xmath40 method confirms this conclusion , and in fact finds a range of model parameters , all of which fit the observations almost equally well , but which imply distinct evolutionary states for the star .",
    "figure 3 shows evolution tracks for three models having masses between 1.13 @xmath50 and 1.28 @xmath50 . in this mass range ,",
    "old main - sequence stars have small convective cores . because of efficient mixing , these cores suffer hydrogen exhaustion all at once , following which the entire star must compress and heat until the central temperature rises enough to start shell hydrogen burning .",
    "the blue - going hook at main - sequence turnoff is a result of this compression . in the case of kepler-4 ,",
    "the observed @xmath40 and @xmath37 ( indicated by the error box in figure 3 ) are closely matched by each of the evolution tracks , albeit at different ages and with models occupying different evolutionary states .",
    "thus , for the lowest - mass star to fit the observations , it must have just finished its core - contraction phase , and be on its way to becoming a shell - burning subgiant .",
    "the highest - mass star to fit the same observations must still be on the main sequence but nearing hydrogen exhaustion in its core , just poised to begin core contraction .",
    "it is not possible to distinguish among these possibilities using existing observations .",
    "although the masses of acceptable models differ by as much as 13% , the radii differ by only 1/3 as much ( in order to give the same observed mean density ) .",
    "this radius difference would cause a difference in @xmath51 that is too small to measure with current methods .",
    "likewise , the luminosity difference of about 8% implies a parallax difference of only 4% , also too small to discern at this star s likely distance of about @xmath52  pc .",
    "asteroseismology may however offer a way out of this quandry . because of the star s relatively large luminosity and apparent brightness , it may be possible to measure the frequencies of its pulsation modes , and hence distinguish among the feasible evolution scenarios .",
    "kepler-4 is now being observed with _",
    "kepler s _ short ( 60 s ) cadence ; the mission will report pulsation properties estimated from these data if and when the pulsation signals rise above the noise .",
    "we list the inferred properties of kepler-4 in table 1 .",
    "for the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath53 we give uncertainties that include the effects of observational uncertainties , of uncertainty in orbital eccentricity , and of uncertainty in the host star s evolutionary state .      given the properties of its host star , the depth of transits due to kepler-4b implies a planetary radius of @xmath54@xmath55 = @xmath13 , and a mass of @xmath56@xmath57 = @xmath12 . as with @xmath45 and @xmath53 ,",
    "these values and uncertainties should be interpreted as describing the centers and 68%-probability points of the marginal probability distributions , accounting for all of the uncertainties .",
    "kepler-4b is therefore slightly more massive than neptune , and about the same size .",
    "its mean density is about @xmath14@xmath58 , greater than jupiter s and considerably larger than saturn s . assuming a 10% bond albedo and efficient heat redistribution to the planet s night side , its equilibrium temperature is @xmath59k @xcite .",
    "radial velocity data provide no evidence for other massive planets in small orbits . because of the limited time span and precision of the extant rv observations , it is however impossible to rule out such planetary companions .",
    "figure 4 shows kepler-4 in a mass - radius diagram that spans the range so far occupied by small transiting exoplanets .",
    "kepler-4b is the third known transiting neptune - like planet , together with gj436b and hat - p-11b ; all three have masses and radii equal or larger than neptune and uranus .",
    "the most important differences between the 3 exoplanets are their host stars and the incident flux the planets receive ( gj436b : m dwarf , @xmath60 = 650 k ; hat - p-11b : k dwarf , 880 k ; kepler-4b : g subgiant , 1650 k ) . on the mass - radius diagram kepler-4b and gj436b",
    "both lie below the @xmath61 baraffe et al.(2008 ) non - irradiated model . in these models",
    ", @xmath61 denotes that the planet has a 10% by mass envelope of h and he , and non - irradiated corresponds roughly the case of gj436b and cooler .",
    "the fact that kepler-4b and gj436b have essentially identical radii ( 3.88 @xmath24 0.15 @xmath62 for gj436b from nasa epoxi @xcite as compared to 3.99 @xmath24 0.21 @xmath62 for kepler-4 ) at the same mass , despite kepler-4b s high @xmath60 , implies a difference in bulk composition .",
    "we suggest that kepler-4b has a h / he envelope of about 4 - 6% by mass and a correspondingly higher water and rock fraction .",
    "however , the inherent degeneracy in this part of the mass - radius diagram means that the h / he envelope might be slightly more massive if the rock - to - water ratio in the interior of kepler 4b is unusually high ( i.e. , significantly higher than in neptune or uranus ) .",
    "nevertheless , we can state with a measure of confidence that there are no possible interior models for kepler-4b with no h / he envelope and neither it nor gj436b is compact enough to be a water - rich super - earth .",
    "the slightly eccentric orbits of the two previously known transiting neptune - like planets , in similar potentials and at similar ages , suggest that their interiors are somewhat less dissipative to stellar tides than the giants in our solar system .",
    "therefore , it would be very interesting to resolve whether the orbit of kepler-4b has comparable eccentricity or is circular ; the current observations are still inconclusive .",
    "funding for this discovery mission is provided by nasa s science mission directorate .",
    "we are grateful first to the entire _ kepler _ team , past and present .",
    "their tireless efforts were all essential to the success of the mission . for special advice and assistance , we thank lars buchhave , david ciardi , megan crane , willie torres , mike haas , and riley duran . _",
