    "thus , for a massive particle the possible spin states are obtained from the @xmath1 lie algebra and are consequently identical to those familiar from non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the little group for massless particles is the euclidean group in two dimensions , @xmath2 ( generated by two translations and one rotation ) , and ( being non - compact ) permits , in general , a continuous parameter ( `` continuous spin '' ) .",
    "one assumes ( basically on phenomenological grounds ) that physical states are non - trivially represented only with respect to the compact @xmath3 subgroup , and identifies its `` charges '' with the helicity , @xmath4 , of the massless particle .",
    "the trivial @xmath5 lie algebra would allow arbitrary values of @xmath4 , but the topology of @xmath6 can be shown to be that of the doubly connected space @xmath7 , so that the requirement of a globally defined wave function restricts @xmath4 to integer and half - integer values .",

    "furthermore , there may be radions ( graviscalar components of the metric tensor in models with extra spatial dimensions ) , dilatons ( _ e.g. _ , in string theories ) , moduli ( scalars with flat potential in supersymmetry ) , inflatons , scalar leptoquarks , and sfermions ( scalar superpartners ) .",
    "spin  1/2 states beyond the sm could be due to a fourth family , right - handed neutrinos , other exotic states ( _ e.g. _ , those needed to cancel anomalies in models with new gauge symmetries ) , techniquarks from dynamical ( strong ) symmetry breaking models , or x - inos ( fermionic superpartners other than gravitinos ) .",

    "in general , one expects @xmath9 to be of the form @xmath24 , and @xmath25 would require a delicate cancellation of the tree and loop terms ( the hierarchy problem ) .",
    "the main mission of the lhc is then to find at least one higgs boson and the new physics providing the solution to the hierarchy problem ( ideally ) also explaining ( i ) why the precision data appear to be consistent with the sm with so far no clear indication for new physics , ( ii ) the nature of the dark matter , and ( iii ) the baryon asymmetry of the universe .    .",

    "one way to address the hierarchy problem is to avoid fundamental scalars altogether . in the original _ technicolor _ ( tc ) idea  @xcite ( techni)fermions condense through non - abelian gauge interactions , break electroweak symmetry ( ews ) , and generate the masses for the @xmath17 and @xmath27 bosons .",
    "it is less straightforward to obtain the masses for the sm fermions and _ extended technicolor _ gauge interactions are needed . in general , this leads in turn to large flavor changing neutral current effects in conflict with observation .",
    "this can be cured by decelerating the running of the tc coupling ( walking tc ) so as to effectively decouple the extended tc gauge bosons .",
    "another complication is the large @xmath10 value and one considers models of top quark condensation ( topcolor ) .",
    "models in which the ews breaks solely due to topcolor predict too large an @xmath10 so that one arrives at hybrid models ( topcolor assisted tc ) .",
    "one also has to introduce an extra @xmath28 gauge symmetry to prevent condensation of the much lighter bottom quarks .",
    "this is one of many examples in which a model of ews breaking predicts a specific massive @xmath12 boson to solve some model building problem .",
    "thus , @xmath12 diagnostics may be an additional analyzing tool for the new physics that breaks ews .",
    "however , models of tc are generally in conflict with the s parameter ( figure  [ stplot ] ) .",
    "incidentally , the s parameter also constrains a fourth fermion generation and rules it out if mass degenerate ( @xmath29 )",
    ". the non - degenerate case is also disfavored and only marginally consistent for specific mass values .",
    "another way to avoid fundamental scalars is to assume that the higgs field is _ composite _",
    "a modern reincarnation of this idea is _ little higgs theory _",
    "@xcite with a fundamental scale @xmath30 of 5 to 10  tev , and where the higgs is lighter since it appears as a pseudo - goldstone boson . in these models",
    "the quadratically divergent contributions to @xmath9 are then postponed by one loop order ( in some models by two orders ) .",
    "one can also assume that quarks and leptons are composite .",
    "this introduces effective contact interactions with an effective scale constrained by lep  2 to satisfy @xmath31 .",
    "in a qft , a particle with @xmath32 can produce a long - range ( @xmath33 ) force only if it is coupled to a conserved vector current .",
    "this can be traced to the iso(2 ) little group mentioned in the introduction and implies the concept of gauge invariance  @xcite .",
    "extra neutral gauge bosons ( @xmath12 ) can arise from extra @xmath28 gauge symmetries as contained , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the @xmath34 unification group , @xmath35 , or in left - right symmetric models , @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath12 could also be a kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitation ( sequential @xmath12 ) , the techni-@xmath37 , or the topcolor-@xmath12 mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath12 mass , @xmath38 , is constrained to be greater than 1305  gev in the sequential case ( delphi ) and @xmath39 to 891  gev for @xmath34 scenarios ( d ) , while electroweak ( ew ) data limit the mixing angle with the ordinary @xmath27 to @xmath40 .",
    "likewise , mass and mixing of an extra @xmath13 are limited , respectively , to @xmath41  tev ( d ) and @xmath42 ( opal ) .",
    "in a qft , @xmath33-forces are produced by an @xmath43 particle only if it is coupled to the conserved energy - momentum tensor implying invariance under general coordinate transformations  @xcite .",
    "the ultraviolet completion of gravity requires its embedding into structures like _ string _ or _ m - theory _ whose growing number of known vacua led to the concept of the _ string landscape _",
    "@xcite and a revival of anthropic reasoning ( the multiverse ) .    string  @xcite and m - theory  @xcite",
    "predict the existence of extra dimensions ( eds ) , some of which are conceivably much larger than @xmath44 .",
    "one can consider  @xcite a factorized @xmath45-dimensional space , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a _ flat _ space with volume @xmath48 . the @xmath45-dimensional planck scale , @xmath49 , is identified with the ew scale , and the hierarchy problem appears here as the puzzle why @xmath50 ( the case @xmath51 is excluded from precision studies of newton s law ) .",
    "collider processes such as @xmath52  missing energy require @xmath53 , while astrophysical bounds , @xmath54 , can be avoided in models .",
    "an alternative is to introduce a _ warped _ 5-dimensional space  @xcite with metric , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the anti - de - sitter ( ads ) curvature and @xmath57 the fifth coordinate .",
    "the ew scale is here exponentially suppressed ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "observables like the @xmath59 or @xmath60 invariant mass spectra can probe the interaction scale of kk gravitons with matter concluding @xmath61 .",
    "in addition to the graviton one can also allow sm fields to propagate in the factorized eds .",
    "_ e.g. _ , tev - scale string compactification  @xcite with compactification radius @xmath62 ( from lep  2 ) implies gauge fields propagate in the bulk .",
    "_ gauge - higgs unification _",
    "@xcite protects the ew scale by defining the higgs as a higher - dimensional gauge field component .",
    "_ universal extra dimensions _ ( ueds )  @xcite allow all sm particles in the bulk .",
    "grand unified theories ( guts ) in eds with @xmath63 ( the gauge coupling unification scale ) can solve many problems of conventional supersymmetric guts  @xcite .",
    "there are also models with sm fields propagating in warped eds ( but not the higgs in order to protect the exponential suppression of the ew scale ) .",
    "these can be viewed as _ dual _ descriptions of walking tc by virtue of the ads correspondence with conformal field theories  @xcite .",
    "no fully realistic models exist , but it is interesting that ews breaking by boundary conditions of gauge fields in warped eds yield _ higgsless models _  @xcite .",
    "in a qft , an @xmath64 particle can produce a @xmath33-force only if it is coupled supersymmetrically .",
    "conversely , supersymmetry  @xcite is the only possibility to extend the poincar algebra non - trivially and its non - renormalization theorems offer the most elegant solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "moreover , in models of supersymmetric unification a large @xmath10 correctly predict ews breaking ( a fact that was known  @xcite even before @xmath10 was measured ) and these are further supported by the approximate unification of gauge couplings at @xmath65 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . finally , the mssm predicts @xmath66  gev for the lighter of the two cp - even higgses , in remarkable agreement with figure  [ stplot ] ( identifying @xmath67 with @xmath68 ) .",
    "the additional assumption of @xmath69-parity conservation ( sufficient to forbid proton decay by dimension  4 operators ) implies that the lightest supersymmetric particle is stable offering an explanation for the observed dark matter ( a similar statement applies to ued models ) .",
