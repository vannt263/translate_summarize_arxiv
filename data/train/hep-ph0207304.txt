    "this program of measurements could yield a determination of both @xmath74 and @xmath53 .",
    "however , the extraction of these quantities from experiment requires resolution of two theoretical issues .",
    "the first involves the overall normalization of the axial vector amplitude and , thus , the determination of @xmath74 .",
    "the normalization  which could be obtained from a fit to the measured @xmath71-dependence@xcite  is strongly affected by electroweak radiative corrections , @xmath138 , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "as emphasized in that work , these corrections are theoretically uncertain , as a result of nonperturbative qcd effects , and the corresponding uncertainty could be on the order of 10 - 20% relative to the tree - level amplitude .",
    "the radiative corrections always come in tandem with axial vector amplitude for pv electroexcitation and can not be determined independently ( _ e.g. _ , by proper choice of kinematics or target ) .",
    "thus , they introduce an intrinsic , theoretical uncertainty in the extraction of @xmath74 from this process . given the estimated size of the uncertainty , it appears unlikely that pv electroexcitation will improve upon the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : barish ] ) .    nevertheless , determining the normalization of the axial vector amplitude via the jefferson lab measurement would be interesting from another perspective .",
    "because the theoretical uncertainty in the odgtd is considerably smaller than both the current experimental error in @xmath74 as well as the estimated theoretical uncertainty in @xmath138 , one might use the odgtr prediction for @xmath74 , in tandem with the normalization of the axial vector amplitude extracted from pv electroexcitation , to determine @xmath138 .",
    "recently , the study of axial vector electroweak corrections has taken on added interest in light of the results of the sample experiment @xcite , which imply that the magnitude of @xmath139 for elastic , pv electron scattering may be considerably larger than implied by theory@xcite .",
    "understanding these corrections could have important implications for the interpretation of other precision electroweak measurements , such as neutron @xmath140-decay@xcite , so it would be of interest to study them in both the elastic and inelastic channels .",
    "a second interpretation issue involves the @xmath71-dependence of the pv asymmetry and , thus , the determination of @xmath53 . in contrast to the situation for elastic , pv electron scattering  where the pv asymmetry vanishes linearly with @xmath71 at low-@xmath141 , the asymmetry for pv electroexcitation contains a @xmath71-independent term . in the framework of ref .",
    "@xcite , this term is characterized by a low - energy constant @xmath142 .",
    "on the scale of the expected asymmetry , the magnitude of the @xmath142 contribution could be significant , particularly at low-@xmath141 where one would want to determine @xmath53 . in order to determine the latter reliably",
    ", one also requires knowledge of @xmath142 .",
    "the second issue could , in principle , be resolved through a measurement of @xmath143 , the asymmetry for pv photoproduction of the @xmath1 . since @xmath143 is proportional to @xmath142 , and since chiral corrections to the asymmetry are small , its measurement could remove the @xmath142-related uncertainty in pv electroexcitation .",
    "thus , measurements of both @xmath143 and the pv electroexcitation asymmetry at a variety of @xmath71 points could yield values for @xmath53 , @xmath142 , and @xmath138",
    ".    new , precise neutrino scattering experiments would complement this program .",
    "since neutrino scattering probes of the axial vector transition amplitude are free from the large and theoretically uncertain radiative corrections entering pv electroexcitation , such experiments could , in principle , provide a theoretically clean determination of @xmath74 .    finally , we observe that the odgtr could provide a theoretical self - consistency check on lattice qcd and hadron model computations of the axial vector @xmath20 transition form factors . while there exist lattice calculations of the electromagnetic @xmath20 amplitudes , the axial vector amplitudes remain to be computed .",
    "the lattice electromagnetic amplitudes appear to differ significantly from experimental values , and it would be useful to have a corresponding comparison in the axial vector channel .",
