    "the study of electron - proton ( @xmath0 ) collisions at hera has improved our understanding of the structure of the proton as well as about the dynamics of the strong interactions at high energies ( for a review see e.g. ref .",
    "in particular , the study of diffractive processes has been one of the most successful areas at hera , with vector meson production and deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) in exclusive processes ( @xmath4 , with @xmath5 ) being important probes of the transition between the soft and hard regimes of qcd .",
    "these processes have been the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental investigations , with one of the main motivations for these studies being the possibility to probe the qcd dynamics at high energies , driven by the gluon content of the proton which is strongly subject to non - linear effects ( parton saturation ) @xcite . an important lesson from the analysis of the hera data at small values of the bjorken - @xmath6 variable",
    "is that the inclusive and diffractive processes can be satisfactorily described using a unified framework  the color dipole formalism .",
    "this approach was proposed many years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite and considers that the high energy photon can be described by a color quark - antiquark dipole and that the interaction of the dipole with the target can be described by the color dipole cross section @xmath7 , with the transverse size of the dipole @xmath8 frozen during the interaction process . in this approach",
    "all information about the target and strong interaction physics is encoded in @xmath7 , which is determined by the imaginary part of the forward amplitude of the scattering between a small dipole ( a colorless quark - antiquark pair ) and a dense hadron target , denoted by @xmath9 , where the dipole has transverse size given by the vector @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the transverse vectors of the quark and antiquark , respectively , and @xmath13 is the impact parameter . in the color glass condensate ( cgc )",
    "formalism @xcite , @xmath14 contains all the information about non - linear and quantum effects in the hadron wave function .",
    "it can be obtained by solving an appropriate evolution equation in the rapidity @xmath15 , which in its simplest form is the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the scattering amplitude can be obtained using phenomenological models based on saturation physics constructed taking into account the analytical solutions of the bk equation which are known in the low and high density regimes . as demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "the combination between the color dipole formalism and saturation physics are quite successful to describe the recent and very precise hera data on the reduced inclusive cross section as well as the data on the exclusive processes in a large range of photon - proton center - of - mass energies @xmath16 , photon virtualities @xmath17 and @xmath6 values .",
    "hera has also provided high precision experimental data on semi - inclusive @xmath18 processes , where the incident proton is converted into a neutron via a charge exchange @xcite .",
    "very recently the first measurements of exclusive @xmath1 photoproduction associated with leading neutrons ( @xmath19 ) were presented @xcite .",
    "the description of these leading neutron processes is still a theoretical challenge . in particular",
    ", the @xmath20 ( feynman momentum ) distribution of leading neutrons remains without a conclusive theoretical description @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we extended the color dipole formalism to leading neutron processes and demonstrated that the experimental data on the semi - inclusive reactions can be well described by this approach . our goal in this paper is to further extend our previous analysis to exclusive processes and try to show that the color dipole formalism may also provide a unified description of leading neutron processes . using the same assumptions made in ref .",
    "@xcite , we compare our predictions with the hera data on @xmath1 exclusive photoproduction and estimate the contribution of the absorption corrections to exclusive leading neutron processes . taking into account these corrections we present predictions for the exclusive @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath21 production associated with a leading neutron in @xmath0 collisions at the energies of hera and future electron - proton colliders .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of leading neutron production in @xmath0 collisions and we discuss the treatment of exclusive processes with the color dipole formalism . in section [ results ]",
    "we analyse the dependence of our predictions on the models of the vector meson wave function , on the pion flux and on the dipole scattering amplitude .",
    "a comparison with the recent hera data on exclusive @xmath1 photoproduction is performed and predictions for the exclusive @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath21 production associated to a leading neutron in @xmath0 collisions for the energies of hera and of the future electron - proton colliders are presented .",

    "let us now compare our predictions with the experimental data @xcite considering different models for the pion flux . in order to constrain the value of the @xmath53 factor associated to absorptive corrections ,",
    "our strategy will be following : for a given model of the pion flux , @xmath52 and dipole cross section , we will estimate the total cross section",

    "it is important to emphasize that these values of @xmath53 are strongly correlated with our choice for @xmath52 .",
    "for example , if instead of @xmath61 we assume @xmath63 , the corresponding @xmath53 values should be multiplied by 4 , since the exclusive cross sections depend quadratically on the dipole scattering amplitude .",
    "if we assume _ a priori _ that the magnitude of the absorptive correction factor is of the order of @xmath64 for exclusive processes , as predicted in @xcite for semi - inclusive one , this implies a preference for the value @xmath63 .",
    "however , as the magnitude of these corrections for exclusive processes is still an open question , as well as the value of @xmath52 , we refrain from drawing strong conclusions . therefore , in what follows we will only present results assuming @xmath61 , but the reader should keep in mind the quadratic correlation between @xmath53 and @xmath52 , implying that the same fits could be obtained with much bigger values of @xmath53 and smaller values of @xmath52 . with more data on different processes with leading neutron production , it may be possible to disentangle @xmath53 from @xmath52 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that leading neutron production is dominated by pion emission from the proton , i.e. @xmath65 . in all existing theoretical approaches",
    "this pion is soft and takes only a small fraction of the incoming proton energy , leaving the neutron with most of it .",
    "this is the physical reason for the peak seen at @xmath66 in the @xmath20 spectrum of the leading neutron .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we analyse the dependence of our predictions on the choice of the dipole scattering amplitude for two different models of the pion flux . as done before , we will constrain the value of @xmath53 by adjusting the predictions of the different dipole models to the experimental value of the total cross section .",
    "we find that the different predictions for the @xmath20 spectra are very similar .",
    "however , the effective value of the absorptive correction @xmath53 depends on the model of the dipole scattering amplitude as expected , since they predict different values for the @xmath28 slope , which determines the normalization of the photon - pion cross section . figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] are in a sense complementary , since what changes in the former ( the flux factor ) is kept fixed in the latter ( where the dipole model is changed ) and vice - versa . in each curve",
    "the overall constant @xmath67 is chosen so as to bring our calculations as close as possible to the experimental points . comparing the curves",
    "we can conclude that the shape of the leading neutron spectrum is much more sensitive to the flux factor than to the dipole scattering amplitude @xmath68 .",
    "the normalization of the spectrum is hence determined by @xmath53 and @xmath52 , since @xmath68 is fixed from the analysis of other data .",
    "the values used for @xmath53 are significantly smaller than those found in theoretical estimates .",
    "larger values of @xmath53 would be more plausible implying a deviation from the valence quark scaling and the consequent change in the factor @xmath69 . a comparison between the curves in fig .",

    "we have extended our analysis to exclusive processes associated with a leading neutron .",
    "considering the same assumptions used for the semi - inclusive case , we have analysed in detail the dependence of our predictions on the choices of the vector meson wave function , of the dipole model and and of the pion flux .",
    "we demonstrated that the hera data on the exclusive @xmath1 photoproduction associated with a leading neutron can be quite well described by the color dipole formalism .",

    "our results indicate that the experimental analysis of these processes is feasible and that they can be used to understand this long standing problem in high energy physics .    finally , it is important to emphasize that the current sources of uncertainties in the computation of leading neutron spectra are : i ) the strength of the absorptive corrections represented by the factor @xmath53 ; ii ) the validity of the additive quark model for the photon - pion cross section ; iii ) the strength of the contribution from direct fragmentation of the proton into neutrons ; iv ) the precise form of the pion flux ; v ) the precise form of the dipole cross section . with sufficient experimental information , we can rule out candidates of the pion flux and of the photon - pion cross section .",
    "we believe that it is possible to constrain the unknown numbers and assumptions with the help of more experimental data on other processes with tagged leading neutrons , such as those on @xmath84 production @xcite and those with dijet production @xcite .",
