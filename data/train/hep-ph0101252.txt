    "the cosmological constant problem continues to defy all attempts to solve it in a natural way that avoids any fine - tuning of parameters  @xcite .",
    "recent investigations of this problem have focused on bulk - brane scenarios in which the standard model fields are confined to a @xmath1 brane and gravity and moduli fields propagate in the higher - dimensional bulk .",
    "the randall - sundrum models and various extensions of the rubakov - shaposhnikov model have shown that a fine - tuning of brane tension constants and the bulk cosmological constant can not be avoided  @xcite . moreover",
    "the ` self - tuning ' models have also been confronted with fine - tuning problems related to the existence of naked singularities .",
    "these attempted solutions to the problem are based on classical or semi - classical models and the issue of quantum gravity and other quantum field theory vacuum corrections remains to be resolved .",
    "it is not yet understood how string theory and d - brane theory can solve the cosmological constant problem  @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetry solution to the cosmological constant problem is prevented from being applicable , because supersymmetry must be broken for energies below 1 tev , and the fine - tuning of vacuum contributions to the cosmological constant occurs already at the standard model energy scale , @xmath2 gev , and lower energies .",
    "an early attempt by hawking  @xcite to solve the cosmological constant problem was based on quantum cosmology and the existence of a four - index tensor in four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the wave function of the universe led to a functional integral in euclidean space with a probability distribution for the wave function of the universe that favours a vanishingly small cosmological constant .",
    "coleman s wormhole solution is also based on the probabilistic interpretation that the universe with the smallest cosmological constant is the most probable  @xcite .",
    "however , as in the case of hawking s proposal , it suffers from the difficulty of interpreting euclidean space gravity and other technical problems .",
    "the anthropic principle solution  @xcite is another attempt to resolve the problem , but it does not explain how to solve the vanishingly small cosmological constant given the current theory of particle physics and gravitation and its parameters .    because we do not yet possess a satisfactory quantum gravity theory , the problem of how to treat the linkage between general relativity ( gr ) and quantum field theory remains somewhat in the dark",
    ". the standard semi - classical approach , in which we write einstein s field equations as @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the ` bare ' einstein cosmological constant and @xmath6 denotes the expectation value of the stress - energy tensor treated as a quantum operator , is basically inconsistent , for the left - hand side of the equation can only be reconciled with the right - hand side by making the gravitational field change in a discontinuous , acausal manner , a behavior unacceptable from the classical point of view .",
    "an ` effective ' quantum gravity interpretation of spacetime can be developed , in which the metric tensor @xmath7 is treated as a stochastic random variable , which is defined by a set of possible values and a probability distribution @xmath8 over this set with @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath1 foliation of spacetime in gr is combined with the canonical formalism to derive a langevin equation for the conjugate canonical momentum , which is treated as a random variable . in this formalism , both the gravitational field and the matter or vacuum are treated in a probabilistic fashion , so that we have @xmath10 thus , there is now no conflict between the two sides of the equation .    by converting the friedmann equation for a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology into a first - order stochastic differential equation",
    ", we can calculate the approximate stationary probability density for the cosmological scale factor @xmath0 , and we find that the most probable value for @xmath0 in our universe occurs for a very small cosmological constant .",
    "wheeler and his co - workers  @xcite suggested that quantum fluctuations in the metric tensor of spacetime , @xmath7 , should occur at the order of the planck length : @xmath11 .",
    "these fluctuations are of order @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spatial dimension of the region in a local lorentz frame of reference .",

    "leads to the langevin stochastic equation for the cosmic scale factor @xmath0  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the random scale factor , @xmath23 denotes the intensity of the quantum gravity fluctuations and @xmath24 is gaussian fluctuations with @xmath25 .",
    "we can take into account the fluctuations of the spacetime geometry , in an effective way , by replacing the planck length @xmath26 by a stationary random variable  @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the mean value .",
    "the extreme irregularity of gaussian white noise means that the time derivative of @xmath22 is not well defined .",
    "however , the standard theory of stochastic processes can handle this difficulty by defining the equivalent integral equation @xmath29 two definitions of the stochastic integral @xmath30 have been given by ito  @xcite and stratonovich  @xcite . both the ito and the stratonovich definitions of the integral lead to a consistent calculus .",

    "we expect that a quantum gravitational system subjected to metric fluctuations for a sufficiently long time will settle down to a stationary behavior .",
    "this means that as time approaches infinity , the system will reach a state for which the probability density @xmath33 has a shape that does not change with time i.e. the probability to find the system in the neighborhood of a particular state becomes time independent .",
    "however , the sample paths @xmath34 will in general not approach a steady - state value @xmath35 , so that the state of the system still fluctuates . however , these fluctuations are such that @xmath22 and @xmath36 have the same probability density , @xmath33 .",
    "the stationary solution @xmath33 of the fpe satisfies @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the initial values of @xmath0 and @xmath40 , respectively , and @xmath41 is the probability flow current @xmath42.\\ ] ] the stationary fpe is then given by @xmath43 which implies that @xmath44 for @xmath45 $ ] . in the stationary case , there are no sources or sinks in the universe for the probability .",
    "we have the equation for the probability density @xmath33 : @xmath46 we define the auxiliary function @xmath47 and obtain the solution to the stationary fpe : @xmath48    we have @xmath49 when there is no flow of probability out of the universe . by using the ito prescription",
    ", we get @xmath50 in this case , the normalization constant @xmath51 is given by @xmath52",
    "let us now apply our effective , stochastic quantum gravity formalism to the cosmological constant problem .",
    "we shall assume that matter is dominated by the vacuum density @xmath53 with the equation of state : @xmath54 and that the universe is spatially flat @xmath55 .",
    "then , we have from eq .",
    "( [ firstorderfriedmann ] ) : @xmath56 where @xmath57 we obtain for @xmath0 the classical de sitter solution @xmath58 where @xmath38 is the initial value of @xmath0 at @xmath59 .    by replacing @xmath0 and @xmath28 in eq.([requation ] ) by the random variables @xmath22 and @xmath60 , we obtain the stochastic differential equation ( [ stochreq ] ) with @xmath61 @xmath62 the approximate stationary probability density is given by @xmath63 $ $ $ $ = n\\biggl(\\frac{3g}{\\lambda } \\biggr)\\biggl(\\frac{r}{r_i}\\biggr)^{\\beta-2},\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and we have used eq.([effectivevac ] ) to define @xmath65 .",
    "we arrive at the result that the maximum probability for the scale factor @xmath0 , for a fixed value of the fluctuation intensity @xmath23 and @xmath66 , occurs for a very small cosmological constant @xmath65 .",
    "we illustrate this result in fig 1 . , where we have plotted the stationary probability density @xmath67 as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath65 for an arbitrary normalization and for decreasing values of @xmath65 . 0.2 in        0.1 in    fig . 1",
    "three - dimensional plot of stationary probability density @xmath67 versus @xmath0 and @xmath65 for arbitrary normalization and dimensionless units .    0.1 true in",
    "it is important to recognize that the cosmological constant @xmath65 is the true effective cosmological constant , that would be measured in gravitational phenomena at long ranges .",
    "it includes all effects of fields and any effects due to phase transitions , such as those that occur at the electroweak energy scale , @xmath68 gev , and the qcd energy scale .",
    "we see that @xmath67 peaks sharply as @xmath65 decreases for fixed values of the fluctuation intensity @xmath23 and for @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the most likely value of @xmath0 for all possible universes occurs for a very small cosmological constant .",
    "the intensity of the vacuum fluctuations of spacetime are expected to be strong at the planck energy @xmath69 gev , where quantum gravitational effects begin to dominate . however , this is the energy scale at which most models of inflation begin to inflate  @xcite .",
    "although the quantum gravity fluctuations lead to a small probable value of the cosmological constant in the early expansion of the universe , this contradicts the usual expectation that it is huge during the inflation period .",
    "this just underscores the cosmological constant problem faced by scalar field , potential - driven models of inflation , namely , the need for a very large cosmological constant initially in the universe , and the subsequent observationally small bound on the constant in the present universe : @xmath70 for the vacuum energy , the bound is @xmath71 in our scenario , this would presuppose that to uphold a large value of the cosmological constant ( vacuum energy ) would require that spacetime is very smooth at the beginning of the universe with @xmath72 in contradiction with our intuitive expectations that quantum gravity effects should be very strong at the planck energy scale .",
    "if the vacuum energy in the universe is truly constant , as is demanded for ordinary matter by the bianchi identity : @xmath73 and @xmath74 in einstein s field equations , then when this constant is required to be zero at the planck energy scale , it should remain zero for the rest of the universe s evolution .",
    "this scenario would avoid the embarrassing situation , in which we have to somehow guarantee that @xmath65 relaxes to zero ( or almost zero ) whenever there is a new phase transition as the universe evolves in time . if there exists exotic ` quintessence ' matter  @xcite , then a time dependent ` cosmological constant ' could exist and the aforementioned difficulty would prevail",
    ". moreover , we are also faced in this case with the difficulty of explaining the coincidence of the quintessence dark energy density with the present value of the matter energy density ( including cold dark matter ) . at present",
    ", the acceleration of the expansion of the universe detected by supernovae data does not exclude a fit to all the current observational data with a constant @xmath65 .",
    "our explanation of the smallness of the cosmological constant is based on an effective quantum gravity , stochastic argument , in which a probability density is peaked at a vanishingly small cosmological constant .",
    "the result is similar in spirit to the baum , hawking and coleman explanations  @xcite ( for a detailed critique of these papers , see ref .",
    "these proposals are based on a solution of the wave function of the universe @xmath75 as an euclidean path integral @xmath76[d\\phi]\\exp(-s[g,\\phi]),\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the einstein - hilbert gravity action including matter terms , and the integral is over all euclidean 4-metrics @xmath78 and matter fields @xmath79 defined on a 4-manifold .",
    "hawking uses a three index field @xmath80 and coleman uses wormholes as topological structures to obtain an effective cosmological constant .",
    "there have been several important criticisms of the underlying formalism , including the problem of having to use a complex transformation to an euclidean spacetime geometry , in which the euclidean action @xmath77 is unbounded from below . in our effective quantum gravity formalism",
    ", we have not introduced any new fields beyond the standard einstein - hilbert action , but we have based our probability analysis on a phenomenological stochastic formalism , using a solution of the fokker - planck equation to obtain our probability distribution . this formalism is well - founded in many applications to fluctuating physical phenomena , and we suppose that it also applies to metric spacetime fluctuations at the planck energy scale .    the quantum gravity , stochastic fluctuations can be considered as the fluctuations of micro - objects , e.g. strings or d - branes , which are expected to dominate spacetime physics at the planck energy . in this way , our stochastic , effective quantum gravity formalism can be considered as a phenomenological picture of how string and d - brane theory could resolve the cosmological constant problem .",
    "however , the problem of supersymmetry breaking of string and d - brane theory would have to be fully understood in such a scenario .",
