    "in 1964 , gell - mann@xcite and zweig@xcite had independently suggested that hadrons are composed of even more fundamental particles called quarks , a proposition which got experimental support later on . in the theoretical front",
    ", the quark matter hypothesis put forward by witten@xcite , had prompted many investigators to investigate an entirely new class of compact astrophysical objects composed of strange quark matter called strange stars ( see weber@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "as quarks are not seen as free particles , the quark confinement mechanism have been dealt with great details in qcd . in the mit bag",
    "model@xcite for strange stars , the quark confinement has been assumed to be caused by a universal pressure @xmath2 , called the bag constant .",
    "farhi and jafee@xcite and alcock _",
    "et al_@xcite had shown that for a stable strange quark matter the value of the bag constant should be @xmath3mev  @xmath1 .    at the backdrop of such theoretical developments , analytic model building of strange quark stars naturally plays a crucial role to understand the gravitational behaviour of strange stars . in this vein , from the perspective of classical gr , we propose here an analytic solution capable of describing realistic strange stars . in an earlier work ,",
    "some of us@xcite had proposed a relativistic model for strange stars where the geometric model of krori and barua@xcite was used to describe the interior space - time of strange stars . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the finch and skea@xcite model to develop the interior space - time of a strange star .",
    "we assume a spherically symmetric star composed of strange quark matter whose equation of state ( eos ) is governed by the mit bag model .",
    "we also assume anisotropy in the matter composition implying that the radial pressure ( @xmath4 ) is not equal to the tangential pressure ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "since the density of a strange star may exceed the nuclear matter density it is expected that pressure at the interior of such would be anisotropic , in general@xcite .",
    "anisotropy in a highly dense compact stellar object may occur for various reasons ( e.g , existence of a solid core , phase transition , presence of electromagnetic field etc . )",
    "whose contributions in the stellar modelling can be incorporated by assuming the star to be anisotropic in general@xcite . in our construction , the assumption of anisotropy provides an extra degree of freedom to deal with the system",
    ".    the strange star model , in this work , has been developed by considering the mit bag model eos and a particular ansatz for the metric function @xmath6 proposed by finch and skea@xcite .",
    "the solution found here has been shown to comply with all the physical requirements of a realistic star .",
