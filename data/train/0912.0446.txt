    "to do precision cosmology it is important to understand accurately galaxy bias , i.e. , how the spatial distribution of galaxies is related to the underlying dark matter distribution . because galaxies are known to form in dark matter halos , its biasing can be approached in two natural steps .",
    "the first step is the bias between halos and dark matter .",
    "the second step is the bias between galaxies and halos , which is commonly approached by means of models of galaxy occupation in halos ( see for instance zheng et al 2005 & 2009 , brown 2008 , tinker 2006 & 2010 ) .",
    "biasing requires a complex modeling and in this paper we will focus on the first step only .",
    "this means that our findings might not be directly applicable to galaxy surveys . in the limit in which halo biasing resembles galaxy biasing or in the limit where observations are good tracers of the halo distribution (",
    "i.e. , for galaxy groups or clusters ) our results will be of direct relevance to the interpretation of clustering statistics in galaxy and cluster surveys .",
    "we will study the halo bias in a big cosmological dark matter simulation from the mice collaboration ( fosalba et al .",
    "2008 , crocce et al .",
    "2009 ) .. we will address two main questions : a ) how accurate is the so - called _ local _ bias model to predict clustering statistics , and b ) how bias predictions from the mass function compare with the ones in local model . in the process of answering these questions",
    "we will also learn about nonlinear and stochasticity contributions to the halo variance .",
    "the local bias model , introduced by fry and gaztaaga ( 1993 ) , assumes a general non - linear ( but local and deterministic ) relation between the smoothed density contrast in the distribution of halos ( or galaxies ) and the smoothed density contrast of the dark matter , i.e. , @xmath13 $ ] . in reality , bias is stochastic and not quite deterministic ( eg . , see somerville et al .",
    "1999 , tegmark & bomley 1999 , dekel & lahav 1999 ) and at some level , due to tidal forces and evolution , it will have non - local and anisotropic contributions .",
    "it is also not clear to what extent the halo or galaxy density should depend only on the underlying matter density , without including other direct dependencies ( like the gravitational potential or velocity fields , for instance ) .",
    "bias could also relate to mass at some initial condition or in lagrangian space ( see , catelan , matarrese & porciani 1998 , matsubara 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "the bias parameters of the local model are the coefficients of the taylor expansion of @xmath14 $ ] , and depend on the halo and dark matter smoothing scale . in this paper",
    "we show that for halo samples with a minimum mass less than @xmath15 solar masses the bias parameters converge at a smoothing scale @xmath16-@xmath17 mpc / h .",
    "we can then compare these local bias parameters obtained by directly fitting @xmath14 $ ] in the simulations with the bias from clustering measurements like the two and 3-point correlations functions , the variance and the skewness .",
    "we will show that the local bias model works well at least within a few percent level .",
    "when this local model is applied to interpret real galaxy surveys it can be used to recover information about dark matter clustering and biasing parameters .",
    "one common way to predict the bias parameters is to use the peak background split ansatz .",
    "bias parameters are predicted from the mass function using few assumptions : locality and also the assumption that the conditional mass function of an overdense ( underdense ) patch of the universe can be treated as if it were equal to the average mass function of the universe at a different time , or mean density .",
    "peak background split predictions for the bias , specially from the sheth tormen mass function ( sheth and tormen 1999 ) , and the press - schechter mass function ( press & schechter 1974 , ps from now on ) have been used a lot in the literature . in the second part of this paper we will compare these bias predictions with the bias from clustering , and with the local bias , and study their dependence on the halo mass threshold used to fit the mass function .",
    "the inaccuracy of the peak background split has also been studied in manera , sheth and scoccimarro ( 2010 ) with complementary results to those of this work .",
    "the peak background split bias parameters predicted from the press - schechter ( ps ) mass function _ together _ with the assumption of the local bias was tested in a precursor paper by mo , jing and white ( 1997 ) , where the local model was used to compare the skewness and higher order moments of halos in n - body simulations with predictions and observations , leading to the conclusion that the galaxies from the apm survey ( as measured in gaztanaga 1994 ) should not be highly biased .",
    "mo , jing and white used a small simulation of only 256 mpc / h and @xmath18 particles with plots that show no errorbars . in some of their plots ,",
    "specially when halos are identified at the same time that moments are calculated , differences between theory and simulations could be interpreted as being significant for our current precision requirements .",
    "unfortunately since they tested the ps bias parameters and the local bias model together , it is unclear how each assumption contributes to the mismatch .    in a follow - up paper ,",
    "casas - miranda , mo and boener ( 2003 ) redid the previous analysis , this time with the sheth and tormen mass function , and applied the results to the lyman break galaxies at @xmath19 .",
    "their plots of skewness and higher order moments still show no error bars , and differences between theory and simulations could amount more than 15% in some cases .",
    "again , the question arises to whether the local bias is a good approximation or not independent of the bias prediction from the mass function , which requires extra assumptions and varies depending which mass function one decides to use . in our paper",
    "we can separate these effects by obtaining the local bias parameters directly from a fit of the local bias relation @xmath20 , thus testing the local model separately , from the bias predictions .",
    "a failure of the local bias model could point towards what other contributions should be included next ( if any ) when analysing observational data to the precision needed for the current generation of surveys .",
    "another difference in our analysis with respect to the previous works above is that we study both moments ( variance and skewness ) and 2 and 3-point correlation functions .",
    "moments are closer to the local relation in that they are both smoothed ( spherically averaged ) quantities , so one would expect better agreement for them .",
    "but they suffer from shot - noise ( or discreteness effects ) and stronger non - linear effects ( as they include clustering on all scales smaller than the smoothing radius ) .",
    "the 2 and 3-point functions do not suffer from shot - noise and can better separate the effect of different scales ( because they are averaged over radial shells rather than integrated over spheres ) .",
    "moreover , the 3-point function provides different information than the skewness .",
    "both are related third order statistics , but the 3-point function also gives shape information ( i.e. , how elongated are the triangles ) which is missing in the skewness .",
    "we also study the 2-point cross - correlation of mass and halos which gives an idea of how important the stochasticity is in the bias relation .    the relation between the mass function and the bias can be inverted .",
    "consequently one may use the bias as a proxy for the mass of the halo sample .",
    "this is of direct relevance to the interpretation of observational data .",
    "systematic errors in estimating the mass from the bias would propagate to , and broaden , the constraints on cosmological parameters ( like the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath21 ) when fitted to the estimated halo mass function .",
    "notice that self calibration methods for the mass function , which are expected to be used by des - like surveys , assume that we know the mass - bias relation ( lima & hu 2005 , 2007 ) . in this work",
    "we will assess how well the halo mass is recovered by using as input the clustering bias parameters from the two and from the 3-point correlation functions .",
    "going one step further , to relate halos to galaxies , it has become customary to use the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) prescription , which consists of populating either theoretically , or in the simulation , the dark matter halos with galaxies , using some simple ( author - variable ) population function that usually depends only on three or four parameters .",
    "the hod prescriptions are far from providing a few percent precision of all measurements .",
    "for instance , scoccimarro et al . ( 2001 ) found that they were unable to match both the variance and the skewness of apm galaxies . since a local model of biasing",
    "is assumed along with the bias prediction from the mass function , it is unclear if this disagreement is due to the hod choice or to the failure of either the local model or the bias predictions .",
    "it is therefore of direct observational interest to assess each step separately , which is what this paper starts doing .",
    "indications that more work is needed to construct reliable galaxy mocks has been given by guo and jing ( 2009 ) . using a semianalytical mock sample of galaxies constructed from an n - body simulation",
    ", they compared the local bias parameters from clustering with the local bias predicted using the peak background split ansatz plus an hod , which were found to be significantly different .",
    "such difference may arise from the fact that the authors were using a published prescription instead of fitting their own hod function , but part of the disagreement could come as well from the local bias and the pbs ansatz .",
    "finally , note that we only study clustering in configuration space .",
    "bias will most likely have different effects in fourier space , in particular regarding shot - noise effects and stochasticity ( see eg . tinker et al .",
    "2010 , seljak , hamaus & desjacques 2009 , cai , bernstein & sheth 2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives a brief introduction to the simulations . in section iii",
    "we study the performance of the local bias model in simulations and present a study of shot - noise and next to leading order contributions . in section",
    "iv we compare the clustering of halos in the simulations with the peak backgrounds split predictions and check how well we can recover the mass of halos from the bias parameters .",
    "we present our conclusions in section v.",
    "in this paper we work with the comoving data from the mice intermediate dark matter simulation , which has a volume of @xmath22 and @xmath23 particles , and consequently a mass resolution of @xmath24 this simulation have been run with marenostrum at the barcelona supercomputer center using the l - gadget code , periodic boundary conditions , and 128 processors . in this paper",

    "the initial conditions were set at @xmath33 using zeldovich approximation .",
    "halos have been found using a friends of friends algorithm with a linking length 0.168 times the mean interparticle distance , which results in 2729833 halos of more than 20 particles at z=0 , and 2110669 halos at z=0.5 .",

    "a simple model for halo or galaxy bias was introduced by fry and gaztaaga ( 1993 ) .",

    "the hierarchical 3-point function , @xmath42 has 3 such distances and is defined as q_3 ( ) we need three parameters to specify the triangle formed by the 3 positions @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we will fix two of these sizes ( @xmath41 and @xmath46 ) and show the results as a function of @xmath47 , the angle between @xmath41 and @xmath46 .",
    "in general @xmath48 has a characteristic u or v - shape ( see fig.[q3z ] ) : is larger for small and large angles than for intermediate values .",
    "there is ambiguity over what we should use as smoothing scale @xmath2 in eq .",
    "[ deltataylor ] .",
    "a common and natural choice is that @xmath2 should be smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "but we will show that this does not provide a good model for @xmath49 mpc / h .",
    "another possibility , that we will support here , is to think of an effective @xmath2 that can be larger than @xmath41 .",
    "correlations are estimated from spatial averages over very large volumes and one can then think of eq.[deltataylor ] as some average transformation over the whole volume . in this sense",
    "this bias transformation just provides an effective description which is only local over a very large smoothing radius .    when the correlation distances are zero we recover the corresponding relations between smoothed variances and skewness ( see eq.[varskew ] ) .",
    "^2_h b_1 ^ 2 ^2  ;   s_3^h ( s_3 + 3 c_2 )",
    "/b_1 here it is common to identify @xmath2 with the smoothing scale in variance and skewness , but this does not need to be the case .    in the above equations , and also in eq.[q3 g ] , the @xmath50 sign indicates that this is the leading order in @xmath51 . note that in general , even when @xmath52 , the linear bias prescription ( i.e. , using only @xmath4 ) is not accurate for higher - order moments like @xmath42 , the reason being that nonlinearities in bias ( i.e. @xmath53 ) generate non - gaussianities of the same order as those of gravitational origin . in general , to predict higher order correlations in halo ( or galaxies ) to order @xmath54 the local relation has to be expanded to order @xmath55 @xcite . in this paper we will only study the clustering to order @xmath56 which means that bias only needs to be quadratic in the local model .",

    "one important prediction of this local model is to expect the shape of the correlation to be unaffected by bias ( or in other words that the effective bias is constant ) on large scales : ^h(r_12 )  b_1 ^ 2  ( r_12 ) + o[^2(r_12 ) ] the next to leading contribution to @xmath61 above is proportional to @xmath62 and consequently negligible at large @xmath41 where @xmath63 .",
    "this will be tested below in section ",
    "[ sec:2pt ] .",
    "it is in principle possible to use the shape of @xmath64 in simulations ( or observations ) to separate @xmath4 from @xmath39 .",
    "this is done by a fit of the halo ( or galaxy ) measurements of @xmath65 in eq.[q3 g ] using the corresponding dark matter predictions or measurements @xmath48 .",
    "changing @xmath4 will produce a distortion of the u - shape of @xmath42 ( as a function of @xmath66 , while @xmath53 only produces a constant shift .",
    "thus , unless @xmath42 is constant within the errors or @xmath4 is very large , one could simultaneously measure @xmath4 and @xmath53 from @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "this idea will be tested below in section  [ sec:3pt ] .",
    "one could also predict @xmath67 from the ratio of the halo to dark matter correlations : @xmath68 , but this requires knowledge of the normalization of the dark matter clustering amplitude in @xmath69 , which is often what we want to fit from observations .",
    "the fit to @xmath42 can produce an estimate of the linear bias @xmath4 which is independent of the overall amplitude of clustering @xmath69 , because the @xmath42 prediction is independent of the normalization .",
    "this approach has already been implemented for the skewness @xmath70 ( gaztaaga 1994 , gaztaaga & frieman 1994 ) , the bispectrum ( frieman & gaztaaga 1994 , fry 1994 , feldman et al . 2001 , verde et al .",

    "we are interested in exploring and determining the local bias parameters directly . in order to do",
    "so we will compare the halo density contrast @xmath34 with the corresponding local matter density fluctuation @xmath35 at the same cells .",
    "we will do this for all cells in the simulation .",
    "this will give us an scatter plot of the relation @xmath36 $ ] from which we can obtain @xmath4 and @xmath53 by means of a least mean square fit to the local bias parabola from the taylor expansion of @xmath34 in eq.[eq : epsilon ] .",
    "scatter plots of halos of more than n=50 particles are shown in fig.[scatterzrs ] for a selection of sizes of the cubical cell ( @xmath71 mpc / h ) , which correspond to spherical top hat volumes of radius @xmath72 mpc / h as labeled in the figures . left and right panels show results for @xmath73 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "it is apparent how the quadratic bias @xmath53 changes sign from convex ( @xmath74 ) to concave ( @xmath75 ) as the redshift increases .",
    "one prominent feature in the plots is the discreteness of the @xmath34 values , i.e. , that we see horizontal lines in the figures .",
    "this obviously comes from the fact that we have an integer number of halos in each cell .",
    "the step in the halo density fluctuations is consequently @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mean number of halos in the cells .",
    "this is the value of the poisson shot - noise , which will decrease when increasing the cell size or when lowering the mass threshold of halos , for we will have a larger @xmath77 .",
    "the matter density field is also discrete , but because the large number of matter particles per cell this effect is not visible in the plots .",
    "the bias parameters obtained from the least mean square fit depend on the size of the cell used to smooth the density field , therefore the issue of what smoothing radius to use when comparing with clustering bias should be addressed .",
    "first , notice that for the smallest smoothing radius the scatter of points is very big . in this case",
    "many points have @xmath78 , which situate us in a regime where the taylor expansion of @xmath79 $ ] can not be applied . when the radius is set to a larger value the scatter gets reduced and almost all points have @xmath80 , situating us within the perturbation regime and producing a particular fit of the bias parameters .",
    "our results of the dependence of the bias on the smoothing radius for several halo minimum masses are presented in fig.[figb1rs ] .",
    "as expected , we see that the values of @xmath4 and @xmath53 change significantly as we increase the smoothing radius @xmath2 from @xmath81 to @xmath82 mpc / h , from where they start to converge to their large scale values .",
    "the convergence is reached faster at lower mass thresholds and , for a fixed mass , at lower redshifts . in our study",
    "we will take smoothing radius of @xmath83 and @xmath17 mpc / h , where the convergence regime has been reached .",
    "through all the paper errors on the measured bias parameters have been computed using the jack - knife method with 64 subsamples of the density fluctuations field .",
    "this is , we first compute the density fluctuations using the true mean density of the simulation and then we create the jack - knife subsamples from which we obtain , using these fluctuations , a set of 64 bias .",

    "this mismatch can hardly be attributed to the stochastic component @xmath102 ( which includes also non - local contributions ) . as in the case of the 2-point function , because the smoothing radius in the local model is very large , we expect the stochastic correlation components to be subdominant ( see section above ) .",
    "a key difference between the 2 and the 3-point function is that the former takes isotropic averages while the later keeps anisotropic information ( something which is not captured either by the skewness , see below , which is a third order statistics but is smoothed in spherical cells ) .",

    "we define the variance @xmath111 and skewness @xmath112 as second and third order moments of the fluctuation field :    ^2=^2 = 1n _ i=1^n _ i^2  ;   m_3=^3 = 1n _ i=1^n _ i^3 where the sum is over a fair sample of points in the simulation ( ergodic assumption ) . in this case ,",
    "one typically considers these quantities as a function of the smoothing radius r. it is also convenient to define the normalized skewness : s_3 =      one of the common ways of determining the linear bias of galaxies or halos is by comparing their variance with the measured / predicted matter variance .",
    "however , to do the correct comparison one has to account for the shot - noise contribution ( a very similar problem occurs in the estimation of the power spectrum which is the variance in fourier space ) .",
    "this contribution to the variance appears because galaxies and halos are not a continuous fields , but discrete ones . for a top hat window function , @xmath113 the poisson shot - noise",

    "this is illustrated in fig.[recovm ] .",
    "we have used the clustering biases measured in the 2-point function ( i.e. , fig.[fig : b1x2 ] ) and in the variance ( i.e. , fig.[b1massclustering ] ) at z=0.5 and use the mass - bias relation from the the st fit to @xmath194 ( which seems to provide the best fit to data ) to calibrate the mass from bias . for the variance we use @xmath121 ( the halo - mass cross variance ) rather than @xmath120 to avoid discreteness effects .",
    "the idea of recovering the mass function from bias and variance measurements , and subsequently fit for cosmological parameters , have been explored by lima and hu ( 2004 , 2005 , 2007 ) in the so - called self calibration method .",
    "they assume a peak background split prediction to relate the bias to the mass function ( in particular eq.[biasparam ] with the fiducial st values ) , and allow for an scatter relation between the proxy of the mass ( eg .",
    "x - ray temperature ) and the true mass .",
    "[ recovm ] clearly shows that there is a bias in the recovered mass , which will propagate into the cosmological fits as a systematic error .",
    "this bias in the recovered mass , could in principle be corrected with the use of mock samples or the non - linear corrections presented above .    to measure the bias based on the 2-point statistics we need to know @xmath195 .",
    "otherwise we just recover the value of @xmath196 in units of @xmath195 .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath42 , which provides @xmath193 with independence of @xmath195 , but at the expense of a larger errorbar and more systematic effects for small masses . for large masses",
    "there are too few halos to have a reliable measurement of @xmath42 .",
    "also note that observations are in redshift space while here we have only show results in real space .",

    "in this paper we have used a cosmological dark matter simulation of volume @xmath197 from the mice simulation team to study the halo clustering and bias of halos above @xmath198 .",
    "we have focused in clustering in configuration space ( as oppose to fourier space ) : the 2 and 3-point correlation function , the variance and skewness and the halo - mass cross - correlations .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * we have looked at the local deterministic biasing prescription , which assumes a local non - linear relation @xmath199 between mass fluctuations , @xmath1 , and its tracer,@xmath200 . in simulations",
    "this relation is an approximation with significant scatter around the mean @xmath9 relation .",
    "we have fitted this scattered relation with a parabola and found the linear bias @xmath4 and the quadratic bias , @xmath5 ( or equivalently @xmath201 ) at different smoothing scales ( see figs 1 & 2 ) .",
    "we show that constant biasing values are reached for smoothings larger than @xmath202 .",
    "this provides a new interpretation for the so - called local model : it local only on average over very large scales .",
    "this has an immediate application for bias calculations as one can set @xmath203 in practice and neglect many of the next to leading order terms in a multipoint expansion .",
    "* we have measured the correlation function of halos , @xmath204 , and compared it to the matter correlation function , finding that the bias is approximately constant at scales larger than 20mpc / h ( see figs 2 - 3 ) as predicted by the local bias model . given our errors , there is some room for a small ( few percent ) scale dependence at scales near the bao . we have shown ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : b1x2 ] ) that this bias in the correlation is very well matched by the local bias prediction from the scattered @xmath35-@xmath34 parabola , when we use a large smoothing @xmath2 ( where convergence to constant values is reached ) * we have measured the 3-point correlation function of halos and fitted its shape to obtain @xmath4 and @xmath205 .",
    "we have shown ( see fig . [",
    "fig : b1q3 ] ) that the linear bias obtained from the 3-point correlation function does not quite match the bias of the 2-pt correlation function ( or the local bias , which are the same within errors ) at our lower mass bins : @xmath206 50 particles .",
    "the 3-point predictions for @xmath4 follow well the qualitative behavior of bias as a function of mass and redshift but there are some systematic ( 2-sigma ) deviations at the lower mass end with good agreement for @xmath207 . for @xmath208 500 particles ,",
    "error bars start becoming too large to conclude .",
    "* we have measured the bias from the halo cross - variance @xmath209 and found that it differs from the local bias at about 10% , or even more for the most massive halos ( see fig . [ b1massclustering ] ) .",
    "the true local bias can be recovered , if we include non - linear correction ( using the measured @xmath5 of the local model ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the bias from the 2-pt correlation function for which there was no need of including nonlinear terms .",
    "* we have measured the bias from the halo variance @xmath210 and found that it is different from @xmath121 and from the linear local bias .",
    "we have shown that in order to be able to predict @xmath120 from the local bias we need to take into account _ both _ nonlinear and stochastic effects ( see fig . [ b1massclustering ] ) .",
    "* we have shown that the appropriate discreteness correction to the variance is sub - poisson , and found that its ratio to the poisson term @xmath211 is approximately constant in our range of masses .",

    "@xmath211 masks the nonlinear contributions , thus giving an estimated value of @xmath4 apparently closer to that of the local bias ( specially at z=0 ) , as we show in fig .",
    "[ b1massclustering ] .",
    "* we have fitted the mass function of halos with a sheth and thormen functional form and applied the peak - background split ansatz to predict the bias parameters .",
    "these predictions depend significantly on the mass threshold used to fit the mass function and they give systematically lower linear bias ( about 5 - 10% ) than that measured in clustering or local relation ( see fig .",
    "[ b1clusteringtost ] and fig.[b1c2mass ] ) . * finally , we have estimated the mass of halos from the measured bias ( fig . [ recovm ] ) , showing that there is a systematic error when using the common st peak - background split prediction .",
    "these systematic errors have to be taken into account when recovering the mass function from clustering of halos , since they will propagate to the estimator of cosmological parameters , like the dark energy equation of state .",
    "we can conclude from the above that the different bias predictions are only accurate to 5 - 10% level . in the case of the 2-point functions ( auto and cross - correlations )",
    ", the local model seems accurate and we find that the origin of the discrepancy lies in the peak - background prescription .",
    "this is not so clear for the 3-point function , where probably both assumptions contribute to the error . for the smoothed moments",
    ", we find that next to leading order and discreetness corrections ( to the local model ) are needed at the @xmath10 level .",
