    "flows over sharp - edged aerofoils are in general separated .",
    "manipulation of this separation in order to achieve beneficial aerodynamic properties is of great practical importance and this topic is therefore subject to a great deal of attention in the scientific and engineering literature .",
    "this control of the flow separation is generally aimed at increasing the lift and decreasing the drag experienced by the aerofoil and the control strategies used can broadly be classified as either _ passive _ or _ active_. passive control strategies usually involve some form of geometrical modification to the aerofoil , for example , by deployment of vortex generators such as gurney flaps @xcite .",
    "active control strategies , on the other hand , involve the injection or extraction of energy .",
    "for instance , synthetic jet actuators are commonly used to perform such flow control over aerofoils @xcite .",
    "another approach is to use some form of actuation to `` simulate '' a passive control , for example , by using plasma actuators to imitate gurney flaps @xcite .    from a physical perspective",
    ", the goal of all such devices is to capture additional vortices thus increasing the circulation around the aerofoil .",
    "for example , in the flow past an inclined flat plate at high reynolds number , large - scale vortex structures are periodically shed from both the leading and trailing edges of the plate . if a leading edge vortex could be trapped above the plate , a potentially large gain in lift could be achieved for little cost .",
    "it was with this motivation in mind that witold kasper designed , and was subsequently granted a patent for , his `` aircraft wing with vortex generation '' @xcite .",
    "following test - flights investigating the stall characteristics of his bkb-1 glider , kasper reported lift - to - drag ratios of @xmath0 at the speed of @xmath1 and angle of attack of 35 degrees , considered remarkable at such low speeds @xcite . if such results could be reproduced and verified , they would likely indicate a previously undocumented phenomenon operating on kasper s glider .",
    "kasper conjectured that a vortex tube formed above the wing concomitantly increasing the lift and decreasing the drag , a phenomenon coined `` vortex lift '' .",
    "he further speculated that this effect could be enhanced by positioning additional `` flaps '' or auxiliary aerofoils close to the main aerofoil to control the feeding and shedding of vortices in the vicinity of the wing .",
    "this configuration , where two additional auxiliary aerofoils are placed off the rear of the main aerofoil is what is referred to as a `` kasper wing '' .    among the first mathematical investigations into the phenomenon of vortex lift was the study carried out by @xcite , where solutions for steady potential flows consisting of a single point vortex located above a thin flat plate in the presence of a uniform stream were given explicitly . in that study",
    ", it was shown that leading and trailing edge loci exist for the point vortex position that satisfy the steady state condition and that these equilibria are force - enhancing , that is , the presence of the point vortex enhances the lift experienced by the aerofoil .",
    "further , a preliminary stability analysis indicated that linearly stable solutions exist only when the vortex is located on the trailing - edge locus not too close to the plate and the angle of attack is greater than roughly @xmath2 .",
    "a similar analysis was carried out for the joukowski aerofoil by @xcite .",
    "mathematical and computational aspects of control problems involving vortex flows were surveyed by @xcite .",
    "some other studies motivated by vortex trapping mechanisms in the presence of aerofoils include the work of @xcite who considered the effect of leading - edge wall suction on stabilization of vortex shedding in the flow over a flat plate at incidence , and the work of @xcite where similar techniques were extended to consider a flapping plate .",
    "investigations of some properties of vortex cells , where an aerofoil contains a cavity specifically designed to trap a vortex , were carried out by @xcite and more recently by @xcite . in the latter study , results from point - vortex , prandtl - batchelor flow , and reynolds - averaged navier - stokes models",
    "were compared to ascertain the usefulness of inviscid flow models in the design of vortex cells .",
    "it was seen that the point - vortex model produced qualitatively similar results to those obtained using the reynolds - averaged navier - stokes system , whilst the prandtl - batchelor flow model gave an acceptable representation of these solutions .",
    "however , the authors also comment that the vortex is expected to be unstable in the configurations considered .    in the above studies ,",
    "the location of the separating streamline is subject to the so - called kutta condition .",
    "inviscid flows over sharp edges are characterized by unbounded velocity on the boundary in the absence of separation and imposing a kutta condition at the desired point simultaneously forces the flow to be regular .",
    "@xcite derived precise conditions under which vortex - patch solutions of the two - dimensional euler equations can be continued with respect to parameters such that nearby solutions also satisfy the kutta condition .",
    "these conditions were illustrated by computing a continuous family of patch solutions connecting the point vortex and prandtl - batchelor solution .    given that flow configurations with trapped vortices tend to be unstable , the purpose of the present study is to propose and validate practical stabilization strategies .",
    "flow configurations will be based on those of @xcite for the single plate case and those of @xcite for the kasper wing case .",
    "we will first provide a control - oriented characterization of the stability of these flow equilibria and will then design a linear - quadratic - gaussian ( lqg ) compensator for their stabilization .",
    "flow actuation will be carried out by placing a sink - source singularity at a chosen fixed location on the main plate .",
    "use of the sink - source as an actuation mechanism is intended to mimic the effect of blowing and suction commonly used in control strategies in which viscosity is taken into account .",
    "pressure difference across the plate at a chosen location will be used as the measurement . by analyzing the performance of the closed - loop control systems we will demonstrate that in fact the kasper wing configuration has a positive effect on the robustness of the trapped - vortex equilibria , which is a key finding of this investigation .    the structure of the paper is as follows : in  [ uc ] we state the model equations in the absence of any control actuation , discuss the stability of the different equilibria and identify the equilibrium configurations which will be subject to further analysis . in  [ ctr - char ]",
    "we characterize the model from a control - theoretic perspective and in  [ sec : lqg ] derive the lqg compensator .",
    "stability properties of the closed - loop system are investigated computationally in  [ nres ] , whereas in  [ stochastic ] the performance of the lqg control is studied in the presence of different perturbations .",
    "further points of discussion and final conclusions are given in ",
    "[ discussion ] and  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we begin by stating the governing equations for both the single plate and kasper wing systems and following this survey the stability of some of the equilibria these systems admit .",

    "this time step was chosen as it is sufficiently small for a wide range of cases .",
    "larger time steps are suitable in many situations , except that when the vortex passes close to a plate a small time step is required . in the solution of the estimation problem",
    "it was assumed that the covariances of the plant and measurement disturbances were given by @xmath340 unless otherwise stated , in the solution of the control problem we chose @xmath341 initially , small perturbations of the equilibrium vortex positions will be considered to demonstrate that the control is successful in each of the chosen cases . following this",
    ", the range of perturbations for which the control succeeds in stabilizing the equilibrium will be examined in each case .    figures [ y02-controlled][kw3-y005-controlled ] correspond to cases # 17 in which the vortex is initially perturbed by @xmath342 away from its equilibrium position @xmath65 ( see table [ tab : cases ] ) . for these small perturbations , and with lqg stabilization added , the trajectories in all cases are stabilized and the vortex position approaches @xmath65 as @xmath343 .",
    "however , the time frame over which stabilization occurs , evident in the time - varying control intensity @xmath344 , differs between cases .",
    "as regards case # 3 , we note that the trajectory in the uncontrolled configuration diverges ( figure [ y02-controlled](c ) ) , even though the equilibrium is neutrally stable , cf .",
    "table [ tab : cases ] .",
    "this is because in this case the magnitude of the initial perturbation @xmath345 is already outside the range of validity of linearization . from a practical point of view , it is pertinent to compare cases in which the vortex equilibrium is at the same elevation above the plate , i.e. , cases # 1 , # 3 and # 5 , and cases # 2 , # 4 and # 6 . letting the current vortex position",

    "it is also noted that an initial `` kick '' is seen in the estimator trajectories and is particularly evident in the trajectories shown in figure [ y06-controlled ] when the vortex has a larger circulation .",
    "this kick is due to the initial perturbation of the vortex location which is not accounted for in the initial condition of the estimator ( @xmath348 in ) .    to explore the range of perturbations for which lqg stabilization is successful in each case ,",
    "`` basins of attraction '' are computed .",
    "they represent the sets of initial perturbations which can be stabilized by the lqg compensator ; trajectories corresponding to perturbations lying outside these basins escape to infinity .",
    "each basin is computed by discretizing perturbations @xmath349 about @xmath65 such that @xmath350 where @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",
    "the algorithm then calculates , for each @xmath353 , the largest value of @xmath354 ( to within an accuracy of 0.01 ) such that@xmath355 as @xmath343 . additionally , to demonstrate the effect of changing the cost of control ( see equation ) , basins are computed for both @xmath356 and @xmath357 . when @xmath356 control is `` cheap '' and can be used liberally .",
    "however , when the cost is increased to @xmath357 , control is `` expensive '' and must be used sparingly .",
    "therefore , for larger values of @xmath330 , the basins of attraction are expected to shrink .",
    "the basins computed for cases # 16 are shown in figure [ basins ] .",
    "when comparing cases # 1 , # 3 and # 5 , the basins of the two kasper wing configurations ( for both values of @xmath330 ) are significantly larger than those of the single - plate configuration . indeed , in cases # 3 and # 5 when @xmath356 , due to the trajectories the point vortex follows past the plates , the control is capable of stabilizing some extreme perturbations .",
    "for the equilibria further from the plate , basins of the kasper wing cases # 4 and # 6 are still noticeably larger than those of the single - plate case # 2 , but now to a lesser extent .",
    "it should also be pointed out that in cases # 3 and # 5 the basin `` engulfs '' the main plate . however , as the vortex approaches the plate boundary , the expression in becomes singular and the numerical computations are no longer robust .",
    "perturbations placing the vortex very close to one of the plates can not therefore be claimed to be part of a basin of attraction .",
    "finally in this section , figure [ kw2-y02-controlled2 ] presents a vortex trajectory together with the corresponding time - histories of the linearised measurements @xmath358 and control intensity @xmath344 for a large perturbation in case # 5 .",
    "this example shows one of the more `` exotic '' trajectories the lqg control is capable of stabilizing in which the vortex moves away from the equilibrium and passes under the plate prior to the control latching onto it and `` pulling '' it towards the equilibrium .",
    "in this section we examine how the lqg control performs in the presence of additional disturbances affecting the flow .",
    "two forms of disturbances are independently considered : the first of these will be random disturbances added to the angle of attack @xmath24 of the oncoming flow and then a vortex shedding model will be introduced ensuring that the kutta conditions ( see equations  ) are satisfied at discrete instances of time throughout a simulation . needless to say ,",
    "the phenomenon of vortex shedding is not accounted for in the flow model ( cf .  ",
    "[ uc ] ) and hence may be interpreted as `` system uncertainty '' . therefore , even though it is deterministic in nature , it may be represented by the term proportional to @xmath237 in equation .",
    "details concerning the two forms of disturbances are discussed in their respective subsections below .      to check how the control performs in a fluctuating background flow , the flow angle of attack @xmath359",
    "is periodically augmented with a gaussian random variable , so that we obtain @xmath360 where @xmath361 , @xmath362 denotes the integer part and @xmath363 is the @xmath364-th sample of the random variable with distribution @xmath365 for some @xmath366 . in other words ,",
    "the stochastic disturbance is frozen over the time window of length @xmath367 before a new sample is drawn .",
    "we are interested here in a single realization of the stochastic process , rather than in any statistic quantities , so once the random variable has been sampled , the closed - loop system with can be integrated as a deterministic system .",
    "we do so with the approach introduced in ",
    "[ nres ] , i.e. , euler s explicit method with the time step @xmath368 .    in figure [ skai0 ]",
    "we show the vortex trajectories together with the corresponding histories of the measurements and control intensities obtained for disturbances with @xmath369 and two different values of @xmath370 ( 0.2 and 0.4 ) . in both these examples",
    "the initial perturbation has been chosen to lie close to the edge of the basin of attraction .",
    "for these relatively large perturbations it is seen that the control still performs well in the presence of a fluctuating background flow , even for large values of @xmath371 .",
    "figure [ skai1 ] then presents two examples corresponding to cases # 1 and # 5 from table [ tab : cases ] with disturbances for which @xmath372 . in both these cases , @xmath373 in and",
    "the same initial perturbation with @xmath374 was used , chosen to lie within each of the respective basins of attraction . in the single - plate configuration",
    "( figures [ skai1](a , b ) ) the control fails and the vortex quickly escapes .",
    "however , in the kasper wing configuration ( figures [ skai1](c , d ) ) the control is robust and the vortex gradually moves to , and then undergoes a random motion about , a point close to the uncontrolled equilibrium .",
    "figures [ skai0 ] and [ skai1 ] illustrate representative types of behaviour seen in the presence of the stochastic forcing in the form .",
    "the general behaviour can be summarized as follows .",
    "when @xmath375 was set to zero , the closed ",
    "loop control system was robust with respect to stochastic disturbances in all cases considered , even for large values of @xmath371 .",
    "perturbed trajectories would eventually perform a `` random walk '' in a region near the uncontrolled equilibrium whose extent depends on @xmath371 . on the other hand , for values of @xmath372 the closed - loop control was unable to stabilize the equilibrium in cases # 1 and # 2 even for small values of @xmath375 .",
    "however , in cases # 36 it remained robust up to larger values of @xmath375 .      we now augment our model with a vortex - shedding mechanism in which point vortices are `` injected '' into the flow at locations close to the rear tips of each plate at discrete instances of time .",
    "the circulations of these injected vortices are chosen such that the kutta condition at the rear tip of each plate is satisfied at the time of injection .",
    "integration is again carried out using euler s explicit method with a time - step of @xmath155 .",
    "vortices are injected into the flow at @xmath376 and then at intervals of @xmath377 .",
    "the injection location is chosen to be at a distance of @xmath111 from each plate tip in the direction tangent to the plate .",
    "that is , in cases # 16 a single vortex is injected at the point @xmath378 additionally , in cases # 36 two further vortices are injected at    [ eq : ipe ] @xmath379    these injection points were chosen as they lie close to the rear tips of each plate and can therefore be considered a fair approximation to a vortex sheet representing a separating boundary layer .",
    "they also provide numerical stability over long integration times .",
    "circulations of the injected vortices are calculated as follows .",
    "prior to injection , the total velocity field , including that owing to any previously added vortices ( see below ) , is calculated at each plate tip .",
    "vortices are then injected at the locations given in  with circulations determined such that the total velocity field , including the contributions from both the vortices already present in the flow field and the newly created ones , vanishes at each plate tip .",
    "this corresponds to solving a single linear equation for the circulation of the one added vortex in single plate cases and to solving a set of three coupled linear equations for the circulations of each of the three added vortices in kasper wing cases . following this ,",
    "the circulations of any newly added vortices are kept constant as the vortices are allowed to move freely , i.e. , their positions evolve in time owing to the velocity induced by other vortices plus that of the background flow . in the results that follow ,",
    "after a vortex has been injected , it is then dealt with explicitly for the remainder of the simulation , i.e. , no shed vortices are removed and no far - field averaging is employed .",
    "examples of the various behaviours observed with vortex shedding added are presented in figures [ shed0 ] and [ shed1 ] .",
    "these behaviours can be summarized as follows . in general",
    ", the addition of shed vortices has a stabilizing effect . in almost all configurations tested , perturbations larger than those in the absence of shedding",
    "could be stabilized ( exceptions to this rule will be mentioned below and are discussed in a little further detail in the following section ) . in figure",
    "[ shed0 ] , two examples are shown in which the vortex is initially perturbed to outside the basins of attraction determined in  [ nres ] . despite this ,",
    "the vortex trajectories are rapidly stabilized and , after an initial increase , the circulations of the most recently shed vortices decay to zero as demonstrated in figures [ shed0](c ) and [ shed0](f ) .",
    "figures [ shed1](a)(c ) demonstrate a slightly different behaviour . now , owing to the larger circulation of the point vortex , instead of returning to the unperturbed equilibrium position , the vortex is held at a location close to the equilibrium and the circulations of the shed vortices tend to constant values .",
    "that is , a new equilibrium state emerges .",
    "finally , figures [ shed1](d)(f ) show an example of a `` chaotic '' case . in situations where the perturbation @xmath345 is too large for the vortex to be stabilized , but not large enough for the vortex to escape , the vortex can undergo a complicated motion in the vicinity of the equilibrium location over a long period of time .",
    "although the presence of vortex shedding has , in general , a stabilizing effect in the majority of cases , two scenarios were identified in which the effect was in fact destabilizing .",
    "firstly , in the configurations corresponding to case # 2 equilibria would not be stabilized for any initial perturbation @xmath345 .",
    "additionally , in cases # 36 when an initial perturbation with a large positive real component is taken , the extent to which the corresponding evolutions can be controlled is reduced .",
    "physical arguments for these scenarios are discussed in the following section .",
    "before concluding , results presented in this paper are briefly summarized and some additional points of discussion are raised .",
    "firstly , from a control design perspective , for the given choice of actuation mechanism ( sink - source singularity ) and measurement ( pressure difference across the main plate ) , all configurations demonstrated a similar responsiveness .",
    "that is , the chosen configurations were completely controllable and observable for all sensor and actuator locations and the corresponding residuals displayed the same general features . placing the sink - source actuator at the location with maximal controllability residual and the pressure sensor at the location with maximal observability , the control was seen to be effective for a range of perturbations in all cases considered .",
    "also , as demonstrated in figure [ fig : pevol](a ) , for comparable setups neutrally stable configurations could be stabilized in a shorter amount of time than linearly unstable configurations . the range of perturbations for which the control was effective varied from cases to case . not unexpectedly , for a given configuration , a larger range of perturbations could be stabilized when the vortex equilibrium was located closer to the main plate .",
    "such equilibria are comprised of vortices with a weaker circulation and they are therefore more easily influenced by the sink - source actuator . however , whilst it was expected that the presence the auxiliary `` flaps '' in kasper wing configurations would enhance the robustness of the control , the substantial increase in robustness was somewhat surprising , especially in cases # 3 and # 5 . indeed , at least in the inviscid setting ,",
    "this demonstrates the large effect additional ( small ) boundaries can have on such flows .",
    "we add that a similar stabilizing effect achieved by a small obstacle placed in the wake of a larger body was observed experimentally by @xcite , and later explained in terms of intrinsic stability properties by @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of the control was then examined in the presence of additional disturbances designed to mimic the uncertainty of the flow model and the flow configuration . with a randomly varying angle of attack @xmath380 ,",
    "provided its mean value was unchanged and equal to @xmath359 , the system could be successfully controlled even for large oscillations of the angle of attack . in such cases ,",
    "the vortex would undergo a random walk around its equilibrium location . on the other hand , as the expectation of the randomly perturbed angle of attack was allowed to deviate form @xmath359 , for which the lqg compensator was designed , the control would quickly fail ( with single - plate configurations breaking down quicker than their kasper wing counterparts ) .",
    "when a vortex shedding model was introduced , the robustness of the control was seen to improve in all cases for almost all perturbations .",
    "an exception to this was when the vortex was perturbed downstream of the equilibrium position in kasper wing configurations ( figures [ shed1](a)(c ) ) .",
    "in such scenarios , pushing the vortex close to the rear tip of one of the three plates would result in three vortices with substantial circulations being shed and the system becoming unstable .",
    "furthermore , with the addition of vortex shedding , new `` exotic '' trajectories such as that presented in figure [ shed1](d ) could be observed . in that particular example",
    ", it appears that the vortex may enter a limit cycle around a new equilibrium . finally ,",
    "although not discussed in  [ sec : shedding ] , it is now noted that in the presence of shedding case # 2 is seen to be uncontrollable for all perturbations . this can be understood by viewing the streamline pattern for this case shown in figure [ sl - c1 - 7](b ) in which the recirculation region of the vortex engulfs the plate . as a result , vortices are shed with far weaker circulations than that of the main vortex and are trapped in the recirculation region .",
    "this eventually leads to a build up of circulation around the plate , a state which can not be effectively controlled .",
    "indeed , it may be expected that this phenomenon will occur for any equilibrium in which the vortex recirculation region engulfs any boundary from which vortices are shed .",
    "in this paper , an lqg compensator was designed to stabilize point - vortex equilibria located above both an inclined flat plate and kasper wing in the presence of an oncoming uniform flow . a sink - source singularity placed on",
    "the main plate acted as the actuation mechanism and pressure difference across the main plate as the system output .",
    "standard methods of linear control theory were used to characterize this flow model and the compensator was applied to a range of systems , the results of which are summarized in  [ discussion ] . other forms of actuation could also be considered , for example , applying an additional circulation around the main plate and details regarding the derivation of such alternative controls can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , the sink - source actuation was chosen for this study as its effect on the vortex can be considered analogous to that of a synthetic jet commonly used in similar studies in which viscosity is included .",
    "a key result of our study is the demonstration of the large effect the addition of small boundaries has on the controlled flow . from a control design perspective",
    ", the effect of the kasper flaps is to `` push '' the vortex closer to the front of the plate and also slightly reduce its circulation ( for vortex equilibria of corresponding elevation above the plate ) .",
    "both these effects are beneficial in terms of the effectiveness of the control .",
    "further , for nonlinearly unstable perturbations where in the absence of control the vortex quickly travels downstream ( cf .",
    "figure [ trajuc](a ) ) , the flaps in general have the effect of slightly slowing down the escape .",
    "this is also beneficial in regard to the robustness of the control .",
    "inviscid flow models similar to that studied here have previously been considered as reduced - order models of real flows governed by the navier - stokes system @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of such reduced - order models , if they can be successfully utilized in the design a control strategy for the full model , is of course very appealing . in comparison to the study of @xcite , where a controller designed based on an inviscid fppl vortex model was used to stabilize a bluff - body wake flow at @xmath381 , applying the control strategy considered here to a flow governed by",
    "the full navier - stokes system will require some additional careful assumptions .",
    "this problem is currently being considered by the authors of this paper ( along with additional collaborators ) with the aim of implementing control approaches capable of stabilizing vortex configurations which concomitantly increase the lift and decrease the drag experienced by aerofoil configurations similar to those considered here , bringing in this way kasper s vision closer to fruition .",
