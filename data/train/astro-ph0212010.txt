    "the helical magnetic dynamo is the basis for a promising class of mechanisms to explain large scale magnetic fields observed in stars and galaxies @xcite .",
    "the basic `` @xmath0 '' dynamo is the specific version most relevant for strongly sheared rotators ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "interface @xmath0 dynamos ( parker 1993 ; charbonneau & macgregor 1996 ; markiel & thomas 1999 ) include the fact that , unlike for galaxies and disks , the dominant shear layer is beneath the dominant turbulent region .",
    "focusing on the simplest `` @xmath0 '' picture ( fig .  1 ) ,",
    "consider an initially weak toroidal ( = encircling the rotation axis ) loop of the magnetic field embedded in the astrophysical plasma rotator . the magnetic field is coupled to the plasma so the field is carried or stretched in response the plasma motion .",
    "now imagine , as in the sun , that there is an outwardly decreasing density gradient .",
    "consider the motion of a rising turbulent swirl of gas , threaded by a magnetic field .",
    "conservation of angular momentum dictates that the swirl will writhe oppositely to the underlying rotation of the system .",
    "this means that the initially toroidal field threading the swirl gains a radial component .",
    "statistically , rising swirls in the northern ( southern ) hemisphere writhe the field clockwise ( counterclockwise ) .",
    "this is the `` @xmath1 '' effect and is shown by the writhed loop of fig .",
    "1a for the northern hemisphere .",
    "differential rotation at the base of the loop shears the radial field ( the `` @xmath2''-effect ) .",
    "the bottom part of the loop amplifies the initial toroidal seed loop as shown in fig .",
    "1b , whilst the top part of the loop diffused away ( the `` @xmath3 '' effect ) .",
    "in doing so , magnetic flux is amplified : the flux penetrating the tilted rectangular surface is zero in fig .",
    "1a , but finite in fig .  1b .",
    "this process is represented mathematically by averaging the magnetic induction equation over a local volume and breaking all quantities ( velocity @xmath4 , magnetic field @xmath5 in alfvn velocity units , and normalized current density @xmath6 ) into their mean ( indicated by an overbar ) and fluctuating ( indicated by lower case ) components .",
    "the result is @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the microphysical diffusivity .",
    "the @xmath9 term incorporates the @xmath2-effect , the @xmath3 term incorporates the turbulent diffusion ( assuming constant @xmath3 ) and the first term on the right incorporates the @xmath1-effect . in the kinematic theory @xcite @xmath1",
    "is given by @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is a turbulent damping time and @xmath12 is the kinetic helicity , which dictates the @xmath1-effect described physically above .",
    "usually , @xmath1 and @xmath3 are prescribed as input parameters .",
    "a long standing problem has been the absence of properly incorporating the ( time - dependent ) backreaction from the growing magnetic field on the driving turbulent motions .",
    "this stimulated criticisms of mean - field dynamos @xcite and motivated interface dynamo models @xcite .",
    "but the backreaction is now much better understood .",
    "steady - state studies of @xmath1-quenching @xcite apply only at fully saturated dynamo regimes , not at early times , when the backreaction is just beginning to be important .",
    "there the growth is fast , and most relevant for astrophysics .",
    "demonstrating this requires including the time - evolution of the turbulent velocity , subject to magnetic forces . carrying this out formally @xcite and using a closure in which triple correlations act as a damping term , amounts to replacing @xmath13 by @xmath14 , where the second term is the backreaction .",
    "it arises from @xmath15 , the force associated with the action of the small scale current and the large scale field .",
    "this residual form of @xmath1 has long been thought @xcite to be the real driver of the helical dynamo and has been employed in attempts to understand its quenching @xcite from the form of @xmath1 , it is evident that a large current helicity can offset the kinetic helicity and quench the dynamo @xcite . in section 2",
    "we summarize the successful backreaction theory , and show how it predicts ejection of twist and writhe of opposite sign . in section 3",
    "we give a new pictorial of dynamo action that includes magnetic helicity conservation , and discuss a simulation of a rising flux ribbon .",
    "observational implications are discussed in section 4 , and we conclude in section 5 .",
    "the principle of magnetic helicity conservation determines the strength of the current helicity correction term in @xmath1 discussed in the previous section .",
    "the magnetic helicity , defined by a volume integral @xmath16 , satisfies @xcite @xmath17 where the magnetic field @xmath18 is related to @xmath19 by @xmath20 , and the current helicity @xmath21 is defined by @xmath22 . without the surface terms ( which represent flow through boundaries ) @xmath23 is well conserved : for @xmath24 the @xmath8 term in ( [ magcons ] ) converges to zero @xcite .",
    "the magnetic helicity is a measure of `` linkage '' and `` twist '' of field lines @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ magcons ] ) then means that in a closed system , the total amount of twist and writhe is conserved .",
    "if the large scale field is writhed one way , then the small scale field must twist oppositely . in the sun ,",
    "differential rotation and cyclonic convection ( the @xmath1-effect ) are both sources of helicity , @xcite but here we focus on the @xmath1-effect , which generates large scale poloidal structures . the @xmath1-effect does not produce a net magnetic twist but produces simultaneously positive and negative magnetic twists on different scales @xcite .",
    "the importance of this scale segregation of @xmath23 for the backreaction term in @xmath1 is easily seen in the two - scale approach .",
    "here we write @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to the volume integrated large and small scale contributions respectively . for @xmath21",
    ", we then have @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the wavenumbers ( inverse gradients ) associated with the large and small scales respectively , and the second equality follows rigorously for a closed system .",
    "the current helicity backreaction in @xmath31 is thus @xmath32 .",
    "we now relate @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "we define @xmath35 such that the large scale magnetic energy @xmath36 and where @xmath37 , where @xmath38 only for a force - free helical large scale field ( i.e. for which @xmath39 so that the force @xmath40 ) . in the northern hemisphere @xmath41 . by writing conservation equations analogous to ( [ magcons ] ) for @xmath34 and @xmath42 respectively ,",
    "we obtain @xmath43 and @xmath44 where we have used @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the case without surface terms and with @xmath47",
    "represents a dynamo without differential rotation .",
    "the solution @xcite shows that for initially small @xmath42 but large @xmath48 , @xmath34 grows .",
    "growth of @xmath34 implies the oppositely signed growth of @xmath42 .",
    "this @xmath42 backreacts on @xmath48 , ultimately quenching @xmath31 and the dynamo .",
    "since the sun is a differentially rotating open system , differential rotation and surface terms are important .",
    "the former forces @xmath49 , and @xmath35 a function of time to reflect the solar cycle .",
    "the presence of surface terms generally requires the use of the relative magnetic helicity @xcite but to capture the key points , we can instead treat them as diffusion terms @xcite .",
    "we combine the @xmath8 and surface terms of both ( [ h1 ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) into the forms @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "we consider the volume average @xmath52 to be taken over one hemisphere and assume that surface terms represent diffusion into the corona . on time",
    "scales much shorter than the 11 year solar half cycle , the left sides of ( [ h1 ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) are negligible and the system is in a relatively steady state .",
    "we then see that the boundary terms are equal and opposite @xcite . here",
    "this implies @xmath53 .",
    "since the boundary diffusion terms represent a flux of ( relative ) magnetic helicity to the exterior , these quantities are connected to measurable observables .",
    "_ we therefore predict that the shedding rates of small scale twist and large scale writhe from the @xmath1 effect are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign . _",
    "the helicity conservation , shedding , and magnetic backreaction are represented simply in figs .",
    "1c  e for the northern hemisphere .",
    "the key is representing the field by a two - dimensional ribbon instead of a one - dimensional line .    comparing figs .",
    "1a & b ( @xmath23 conservation not included ) with figs .",
    "1c & d ( @xmath23 conservation included ) we see that in the latter , as the @xmath1-effect produces its large scale writhe ( the loop corresponding to gradient scale @xmath54 ) it also twists the ribbon ( corresponding to gradient scale @xmath55 ) .",
    "the large - scale writhe is right handed , but the twist along the ribbon is left - handed and so the total @xmath23 is conserved .",
    "this is the simplest generalization of the picture in fig .  1a , to include helicity conservation .",
    "the ribbon should be thought of as a mean field , averaged over smaller fluctuations , and so the actual field need not be so smooth .",
    "the top view is shown in fig .",
    "1e for comparison to observations . in the northern hemisphere",
    "we expect an n shaped ( or reverse - s ) sigmoid prominence and in the southern hemisphere we would expect an s shaped sigmoid . in fig .",
    "1e we also show the backreaction force corresponding to the small - scale magnetic twist along the ribbon : it fights against writhing or bending the ribbon .",
    "eventually this twisting would suppress the @xmath1 effect ( and thus statistically , its hemispheric average @xmath31 entering ( [ h1 ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) ) , which thrives on being able to writhe the ribbon . in the sun ,",
    "such sigmoid structures precede cmes @xcite which on time scales of order days or weeks dissipate both the writhe and twist . in doing so",
    ", they help alleviate the backreaction on the @xmath1 effect , and allow a net amplification of magnetic flux inside the sun as shown in fig .  1c . some loops produced by the dynamo",
    "may not escape , implying that some of the simultaneous diffusion of @xmath34 and @xmath42 is hidden in the solar interior .",
    "but even so , the helicity fluxes of @xmath34 and @xmath42 from the loops which do escape , should still be equal and opposite .",
    "getting rid of @xmath42 simultaneously with @xmath34 , either internally or externally , is what alleviates the backreaction , external removal by means of cmes is one important aspect of how this occurs .",
    "removal of @xmath42 implies that by solar minimum the @xmath1 effect is again driven by @xmath56 , allowing the cycle to repeat .",
    "we have performed a numerical simulation to measure the magnetic helicity spectrum of a buoyant magnetic flux ribbon in the presence of rotation which confirms the basic ideas that twist and writhe emerge with opposite sign .",
    "though rising flux tube simulations have been carried out in the past @xcite they have not focused on the magnetic helicity spectrum .",
    "we started with a toroidal , horizontal flux tube and a vertically dependent sinusoidal modulation of the entropy along the ribbon .",
    "this destabilizes the ribbon to buckle and rise in one portion .",
    "the boundaries were sufficiently far away to use a fourier transform to obtain power spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fpspec ] ) .",
    "after @xmath57 free - fall times the spectrum shows mostly positive magnetic helicity together with a gradually increasing higher wavenumber component of negative spectral helicity density .",
    "the latter is the anticipated contribution from the twist along the ribbon .",
    "in comparing the above results with observations note that the magnetic helicity is a volume integral , so the ribbon on which the twisted prominence arises may have a hidden twist elsewhere inside the sun .",
    "this subtlety is surmounted by use of the relative magnetic helicity @xcite which allows a quantifiable interpretation of locally twisted structures .",
    "observations typically measure the current helicity density , @xmath58 , within a single structure , from which hemispheric averages can be computed , or the surface - integrated relative magnetic helicity fluxes .",
    "existing observations seem to be consistent with our basic picture .",
    "first , the observed n sigmoids outnumber s sigmoids by a ratio of 6:1 in the northern hemisphere with the expected reverse relation in the southern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "studies of sigmoids such as gibson et al .",
    "2002 and refs .",
    "therein ) do seem to show qualitative agreement with our picture .",
    "figure  2a of gibson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) shows a trace image of an n - sigmoid ( right - handed writhe ) with left - handed twisted filament of the active region noaa ar 8668 , typical of the northern hemisphere just as we predict .",
    "( as our theory is statistical in nature , it is also not surprising that occasionally n sigmoids such as ar8100 ( as opposed to s sigmoids ) appear in the southern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "but even for ar8100 , the writhe is opposite in sign to the twist along the prominence . )",
    "second , recent work confirms a basic hemispheric dependence of the sign of small scale current helicity , corresponding to the twist along the ribbon in fig .",
    "measurements of small scale current helicity densities and surface - integrated relative magnetic helicity fluxes @xcite as well as fits to line of sight magnetograms of solar active regions @xcite show primarily negative values in the north and positive in the south .",
    "these studies measure the sign of the twist along the ribbon not the writhe of the ribbon itself .",
    "we therefore agree that signs of current helicity measured by these line of sight magnetograms are characteristic of the small scale rather than the large scale field @xcite .",
    "twist is expected at the apex of a writhed prominence since the density is lowest ( parker 1974 ; choudhuri 2002 ) .    in sum , fig .  1e , showing an n sigmoid is consistent with the dominant structures of the northern hemisphere .",
    "large scale positive writhe dominates in the north , and large scale negative writhe dominates in the south .",
    "small scale twists along the prominences are predominately negative in the north and positive in the south , so as to produce a very small net helicity in each hemisphere .",
    "this is complementary to demoulin et .",
    "al ( 2002 ) where oppositely signed twist an writhe from shear were shown to be able to largely cancel , producing a small total magnetic helicity .",
    "here we focused on the @xmath1-effect which has the same effect .",
    "finally note that our @xmath33 represents a local averaging over the small scale twist so that @xmath33 has only the writhe ( fig .",
    "1a is thus applicable to @xmath33 , whereas fib 1c shows both @xmath33 and @xmath59 ) . on even larger scales , the globally averaged field computed by an",
    "azimuthal average @xmath60 , is weaker than @xmath61 in a local structure , due to the small filling fraction .",
    "we have suggested that a new understanding of how helical dynamos conserve magnetic helicity may help resolve several mysteries of the solar magnetic field .",
    "we have shown that large and small scale helicities of approximately equal magnitude should be ejected into the solar corona as part of the sustenance of the solar cycle .",
    "the large scale helicity corresponds to the writhe of a prominence , whilst the small scale helicity corresponds to the twist along the prominence .",
    "we emphasize the importance of simultaneously detecting large and small scale contributions to the losses of helical magnetic fields in pre - cme sigmoid structures at the solar surface .",
    "the observations seem to be roughly consistent with our simple picture at present but more studies and detailed modeling will be needed to test these ideas .",
    "our fig .",
    "1 illustrates the basic concepts through a new pictorial representation of the mean field dynamo that includes magnetic helicity conservation and the backreaction .",
    "the implications are also relevant for large scale dynamos in other stars and disks in astrophysics .",
