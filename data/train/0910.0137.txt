    "this paper provides the mathematical foundation for stochastically continuous affine processes on the cone of positive semidefinite symmetric @xmath0-matrices @xmath1 .",
    "these matrix - valued affine processes have arisen from a large and growing range of useful applications in finance , including multi - asset option pricing with stochastic volatility and correlation structures , and fixed - income models with stochastically correlated risk factors and default intensities .    for illustration ,",
    "let us consider a multi - variate stochastic volatility model consisting of a @xmath2-dimensional logarithmic price process with risk - neutral dynamics @xmath3 and stochastic covariation process @xmath4 , which is a proxy for the instantaneous covariance of the price returns . here",
    "@xmath5 denotes a standard @xmath2-dimensional brownian motion , @xmath6 the constant interest rate , @xmath7 the vector whose entries are all equal to one and @xmath8 the vector containing the diagonal entries of @xmath9 .    the necessity to specify @xmath9 as a process in @xmath1 such that it qualifies as covariation process is one of the mathematically interesting and demanding aspects of such models .",
    "beyond that , the modeling of @xmath9 must allow for enough flexibility in order to reflect the stylized facts of financial data and to adequately capture the dependence structure of the different assets .",
    "if these requirements are met , the model can be used as a basis for financial decision - making in the area of portfolio optimization , pricing of multi - asset options and hedging of correlation risk .",
    "the tractability of such a model crucially depends on the dynamics of @xmath9 .",
    "a  large part of the literature in the area of multivariate stochastic volatility modeling has proposed the following affine dynamics for @xmath9 : @xmath10\\\\[-8pt ] x_0&=&x\\in s_d^+ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is some suitably chosen matrix in @xmath1 , @xmath12 some invertible matrices , @xmath13 a standard @xmath0-matrix of brownian motions possibly correlated with @xmath5 , and @xmath14 a pure jump process whose compensator is an affine function of @xmath9 .",
    "the main reason for the analytic tractability of this model is that , under some technical conditions , the following affine transform formula holds : @xmath15 = e^{\\phi(t , z , v)+{\\operatorname{tr}}(\\psi(t , z , v ) x)+ v^\\top y}\\ ] ] for appropriate arguments @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 solve a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , which are determined by the model parameters . setting @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 and taking @xmath23",
    ", we arrive at @xmath24 = e^{-\\phi(t , u)-{\\operatorname{tr}}(\\psi(t , u ) x)},\\qquad u\\in s_d^+.\\ ] ]    in this paper , we characterize the class of all stochastically continuous time - homogeneous markov processes with the key property ( [ introaffine])henceforth called affine processes  on @xmath1 .",
    "our main result shows that an affine process is necessarily a feller process whose generator has affine coefficients in the state variables .",
    "the parameters of the generator satisfy some well - determined admissibility conditions , and are in a one - to - one relation with those of the corresponding odes for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "conversely , and more importantly for applications , we show that for any admissible parameter set there exists a unique well - behaved affine process on @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , we prove that any stochastically continuous infinitely decomposable markov process on @xmath1 is affine with zero diffusion , and vice versa .    on the one hand ,",
    "our findings extend the model class ( [ eq : cov process ] ) , since a more general drift and jumps are possible .",
    "indeed , we allow for full generality in @xmath11 , as long as @xmath27 , for a general linear drift part @xmath28 and for an inclusion of ( infinite activity ) jumps",
    ". this of course enables more flexibility in financial modeling . for example , due to the general linear drift part , the volatility of one asset can generally depend on the other ones , which is not possible for @xmath29 . on the other hand , we now know the exact assumptions under which affine processes on @xmath1 actually exist .",
    "our characterization of affine processes on @xmath1 is thus exhaustive . beyond that ,",
    "the equivalence of infinitely decomposable markov processes with state space @xmath1 and affine processes without diffusion is interesting in its own right .",
    "this paper complements duffie , filipovi and schachermayer @xcite , who analyzed time - homogeneous affine processes on the state space @xmath30 .",
    "have been explored in @xcite . ]",
    "matrix - valued affine processes seem to have been studied systematically for the first time in the literature by bru , who introduced the so called wishart processes .",
    "these are generalizations of squares of matrix ornstein  uhlenbeck processes , that is , of the form ( [ eq : cov process ] ) for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , for some real parameter @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath33 is a stronger assumption than what we require on @xmath11 and @xmath34 .",
    "bru @xcite then establishes existence and uniqueness of a local @xmath1-valued solution to ( [ eq : cov process ] ) under the additional assumptions that @xmath35 has distinct eigenvalues , @xmath36 , and that @xmath37 and @xmath38 commute ( see @xcite , theorem 2@xmath39 ) . in the more special case",
    "where @xmath40 and @xmath41 , bru @xcite shows global existence and uniqueness for ( [ eq : cov process ] ) for any @xmath35 with distinct eigenvalues ( see @xcite , theorem 2 and last part of section 3 ) .. but these are degenerate solutions , as they are only defined on lower - dimensional subsets of the boundary of @xmath1 ( see @xcite , corollary 1 ) . ]",
    "bru s results concerning strong solutions have recently been extended to the case of matrix valued jump - diffusions ; see @xcite .",
    "wishart processes have subsequently been introduced in the financial literature by gourieroux and sufana @xcite and gourieroux et al .",
    "financial applications thereof have then been taken up and carried further by various authors , including da fonseca et al .",
    "@xcite and buraschi , cieslak and trojani @xcite .",
    "grasselli and tebaldi @xcite give some general results on the solvability of the corresponding riccati odes .",
    "barndorff - nielsen and stelzer @xcite provide a theory for a certain class of matrix - valued lvy driven ornstein ",
    "uhlenbeck processes of finite variation .",
    "leippold and trojani @xcite introduce @xmath1-valued affine jump diffusions and provide financial examples , including multi - variate option pricing , fixed - income models and dynamic portfolio choice .",
    "all of these models are contained in our framework .",
    "we want to point out that the full characterization of positive semidefinite matrix - valued affine processes needs a multitude of methods . in order to prove the fundamental property of regularity of affine processes",
    "another adaption of the famous analysis of montgommery and zippin is necessary , which has been worked out in @xcite and @xcite for the state space @xmath42 . for the necessary conditions on drift , diffusion and jump parameters we need the theory of infinitely divisible distributions on @xmath1 .",
    "most interestingly , the constant drift part @xmath11 must satisfy a condition depending on the magnitude of the diffusion component ( see proposition [ th : constant drift ] ) , which is in accordance with the choice of the drift in bru s work @xcite on wishart processes , as explained above .",
    "this enigmatic additional condition on the drift @xmath11 is derived by studying the process with respect to well chosen test functions , including in our case the determinant of the process .",
    "it is worth noting , as already visible in dimension one , that a naive application of classical geometric invariance conditions does not bring the correct necessary result on the drift but a stronger one .",
    "indeed , take a one - dimensional affine diffusion process @xmath9 solving @xmath43 then a back - of - the - envelope calculation would yield the stratonovich drift at the boundary point @xmath44 of value @xmath45 , leading to the necessary parameter restriction @xmath46 , which is indeed too strong .",
    "it is well known that the correct parameter restriction is @xmath47 .",
    "we see two reasons why geometric conditions on the drift can not be applied : first , precisely at the boundary of our state spaces the diffusion coefficients are not lipschitz continuous anymore , and , second , the boundary of the cone of positive semi - definite matrices is not a smooth submanifold but a more complicated object .    for the sufficient direction",
    "refined methods from stochastic invariance theory are applied .",
    "having established viability of a particular class of jump - diffusions on @xmath1 , existence of affine processes on @xmath1under the necessary parameter conditions  is shown through the solution of a martingale problem .",
    "uniqueness follows by semigroup methods which need the theory of multi - dimensional riccati equations .    summing up",
    ", we face two major problems in the analysis of positive matrix valued affine processes .",
    "first , the candidate stochastic differential equations necessarily lead to volatility terms which are not lipschitz continuous at the boundary of the state space .",
    "this makes every existence , uniqueness and invariance question delicate .",
    "second , the jump behavior transversal to the boundary is of finite total variation .      for affine processes on @xmath1 ,",
    "results and proofs deviate in essential points from the theory on state spaces of the form @xmath30 given in @xcite , which is a consequence of the more involved geometry of this nonpolyhedral cone .",
    "the program of the paper as outlined below therefore includes a comparison with the approach in @xcite .",
    "section [ section : definition of affine property ] contains the main definition and a summary of the results of this article . in section [ subsec : regular and feller ] , we then derive two main properties , namely the regularity of the process and the feller property of the associated semigroup .",
    "the feller property , in turn , is a simple consequence of an important positivity result of the characteristic exponents @xmath48 , which is proved in lemma [ prop : feller prop ] .",
    "this lemma is further employed as a tool for the treatment of the generalized riccati differential equations in section  [ section : riccati ] ( see proof of proposition [ prop_ricc_sol ] ) . the global existence and uniqueness of these equations",
    "is then used to show uniqueness of the martingale problem for affine processes ( see proof of proposition [ th : existence markov ] ) .    in section",
    "[ section : nec paramter restrictions ] , we define a set of admissible parameters specifying the infinitesimal generator of affine semigroups and prove the necessity of the parameter restrictions ( see proposition [ th : necessary admissibility ] ) .    the sufficient direction is then treated in section [ sec : existence ] .",
    "it is known that , for @xmath49 , there exist continuous affine processes on @xmath1 which are  in contrast to those on the state space @xmath30_not _ infinitely divisible ( see example [ counterex : bru ] ) . the analysis of this paper reveals the failure of infinite divisibility as a consequence of the drift condition ( see proof of theorem [ th : char infdec infdiv ] ) .",
    "this has substantial influence on the approach chosen here to prove existence of affine processes associated with a given parameter set : being in general hindered to recognize the solutions of the generalized riccati differential equations as cumulant generating functions of sub - stochastic measures , as done in @xcite , section 7 , we solve the martingale problem for the associated lvy type generator on @xmath1 , as exposed in section [ sec : existence ] and appendix [ app : viability ] . in section [ subsec : alternative existence ] , however , we deliver a variant of the existence proof of @xcite for pure jump processes , which is possible in this case due to the absence of a diffusion component .    finally , section [ secproofs ] contains the proofs of the main results which build on the propositions of the previous sections .      for the stochastic background and notation , we refer to standard text books such as @xcite and @xcite .",
