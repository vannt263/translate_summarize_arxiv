    "one fundamental difference between classical and quantum mechanics is the unavoidable back - action of quantum measurement . on the one hand ,",

    "a basic problem in quantum physics and engineering is how to drive a quantum system to a desired target state .",
    "there have been studies on the preparation of a given target state from a given initial state using sequential ( projective or non - projective ) measurements in the last few years @xcite .",
    "a quantum measurement @xmath0 is described by a collection of measurement operators @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an index set for measurement outcomes and the measurement operators satisfy @xmath3 suppose we perform the quantum measurement @xmath0 on density operator @xmath4 , the probability of obtaining result @xmath5 is @xmath6 , and when @xmath5 occurs , the post - measurement state of the quantum system becomes @xmath7    if we are unaware of the measurement result , the unconditional state of the quantum system after the measurement can be expressed as @xmath8 if @xmath9 are orthogonal projectors , i.e. , the @xmath10 are hermitian and @xmath11 , @xmath0 is a projective measurement .",

    "can be expressed as @xmath14 it has been shown , analytically or numerically , how to select the measurements @xmath12 so that @xmath15 can asymptotically tend to a desired target state @xcite .    making use of feedback information for quantum measurement and detection actually has a long history , which can be viewed as the dual problem of state manipulation .",
    "the  dolinar s receiver \" proposes a feedback strategy for discriminating two possible quantum states with prior distribution with minimum probability of error @xcite .",
    "the problem is known as the quantum detection problem and helstrom s bound characterizes the minimum probability of error for discriminating any two non - orthonormal states @xcite .",
    "quantum detection is to identify uncertain quantum states via projective measurements ; while the considered quantum state projection is to manipulate a certain quantum state to a certain target , again via projective measurements .",
    "the dolinar s scheme follows a similar structure that measurement is selected based on previous measurement results on different segments of the pulse , and was recently realized experimentally @xcite .",

    ". such derivation of the optimal policy falls to belavkin s quantum feedback theory @xcite .",
    "numerical examples are given which indicate that the proposed feedback policy significantly improves the success probability compared to classical policy by consecutive projections without taking feedback .",
    "in particular , the probability of reaching the target state @xmath16 via feedback policy reaches @xmath17 using merely @xmath18 measurements from initial state @xmath19 .",
    "other optimality criteria are also discussed such as the maximal expected fidelity and the minimal arrival time , and some connections and differences among the the different criteria are also discussed .",
