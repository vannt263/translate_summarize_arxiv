    "the language of lie groups that is traditionally employed when constructing new integrable quantum few- and many - body systems ( @xcite ; @xcite , ch .  5 therein ;",
    "@xcite ) inadvertedly prohibits non - crystallographic symmetries from being considered , since no associated lie groups exist .",
    "some additional consistency can be gained if the context is shifted away from lie groups and towards discrete reflection groups , affine or finite , classic or exceptional , crystallographic or not . in this paper , we explicitly construct two quantum solvable four- and five - body systems based on the non - crystallographic groups @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "we build on the general results obtained in the course of work devoted to extending the realm of integrable systems to the cases covered by the exceptional reflection groups @xcite ( the case of @xmath3 in particular ) , long thought to be irrelevant ( see @xcite , paragraph 5.2.3(c ) therein ) : prior to @xcite , the scope of applicable refection groups has been limited to @xmath4 ( respectively @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "these groups correspond to @xmath8 atoms of the same mass , on a line ( resp .",
    "ring ) and on a half - line ( resp .  in a box ) respectively .",
    "the essence of the extension presented in @xcite is a diversification of the variety of maps between the particle coordinates and the cartesian spaces in which the reflection groups operate .",
    "such improvement allowed one to include ensembles of particles of different mass in consideration . as a result , it was possible to devise a general scheme according to which every reflection group",
    " finite or affine  whose coxeter diagram @xcite does not have forks , generates an exactly solvable quantum few- or many - body system ( or a few - parametric family of them ) of hard - core particles on a line , a half - line , or in a box or on a ring . we should note that when the associated reflection group is known , construction of the particle eigenstates _ per se _ follows a known scheme that exists for any solvable kaleidoscopic cavity with homogeneous robin boundary conditions , irrespectively of whether it has a particle analogue or not @xcite .",
    "regretfully , the above scheme does not allow for any extension to the case of finite strength interactions , if one requires the interactions be both of a two - body nature and act only on a contact .",
    "the physical reason is that the for finite interactions , particles are allowed to explore the whole multidimensional coordinate space where the reflection group operates .",
    "however , with the exception of the group @xmath4 ( and @xmath6 with restrictions ) , the number of mirrors in the group grows much faster then the number of particle pairs . in section .  4",

    "in this paper , we propose two new families of exactly solvable quantum four- and five - body problems ; these cases are associated with the symmetries of an icosahedron and a @xmath0-cell ( i.e.  a four - dimensional analogue of an icosahedron ) respectively .",
    "this result explicitly demonstrates that non - crystallographic reflection groups can be used to construct quantum integrable few - body systems , on par with the crystallographic ones .",
    "in addition to the generic eigenstates we also analyze the zero - energy eigenstates , that correspond to the lowest - degree anti - invariant polynomials of the corresponding reflection group .",
    "we believe our results can not be extended to the case of finite - strength @xmath84-interactions between the particles if the local ( i.e. contact ) two - body nature of the interactions is to be preserved .",
    "indeed it can be shown that , in order to preserve integrability of the system , the @xmath84-function potentials at the 15 mirrors of the @xmath1 group must have the same strength , infinite or finite . in the finite case ,",
    "any permutation of the four particles involved is possible , leading to 6 hyperplanes of contact , a number that differs from the number of mirrors in the group .",
    "in contrast , for a given permutation , preserved over time , of the hard - core particles , only 3 hyperplanes of contact are physically accessible ; the number of mirrors accessible , given the particles impenetrability , is also 3 .",
    "likewise , in the case of the @xmath2 group , the number of the hyperplanes of particle - particle contact ( i.e. 10 ) would differ from the number of the mirrors ( i.e. 60 ) .",
    "the relevance of the `` counting '' argument above can be strengthened by the most tangible case of two @xmath84-interacting particles in the field of a fixed @xmath84-potential of a different strength . here , in the two - dimensional plane of system s coordinate space ,",
    "the potential is localized along the horizontal , vertical , and one of the diagonal lines , a set is clearly not closed under reflections about its own members . and ,",
    "as it is shown in @xcite , the eigenstates show features inconsistent with integrability , diffraction being the primary one .",
    "the mirror symmetry ( @xmath85 in this case ) and the associated integrability could be restored by adding an unphysical interaction that acts when the particles are located at the same distance from the potential but on the opposite sides of it . and finally the system can be returned to the realm of physical by raising the strength of the stationary potential to infinity , while keeping the `` unphyisical '' part of the interparticle interactions . for in an initial condition where both particles start at the same side of the potential , they would simply not be capable to explore the `` unphyisical '' part . in this example , both the empirical relevance and the integrability of a model can be preserved , but only at the expense of reducing choice of one of the interactions to infinite values .",
    "the remaining non - crystallographic reflection groups , @xmath86 , associated with the symmetries of regular polygons , deserve attention . even though the resulting three body integrable systems  whose classical versions were analysed in @xcite  are conceptually much simpler then most of the other problems of this class , there are two aspects call for closer consideration .",
    "firstly , as it has been shown classically in @xcite , a many - body system that contains integrable few - body sub - systems shows a slowdown of relaxation : a quantum version of the phenomenon is in order .",
    "the case of @xmath86 symmetry is the most empirically relevant , since it can be realized with _ only two _ atomic species .",
    "secondly , exact eigenstates , albeit not of the bethe ansatz type , can be obtained for any set of masses of three hard - core particles on a line ; a separation of the radial and angular components of the relative motion can be used .",
    "this case can be used to analyze the relationship between the bethe ansatz integrability ( along with possible associated liouville integrability @xcite ) and the existence of the exact solutions in general .    on a different front ,",
    "the answer to the question of existence of particle realizations of reflection symmetries with the bifurcating coxeter diagrams , @xmath87(@xmath88 ) , @xmath89 , and @xmath90(@xmath91 ) , remains as elusive as ever .",
