    "the quantum properties of light fields are one of the central objects studied in quantum optics . in this context",
    "it has been realized early on that optical nonlinearities are needed to generate non - classical output fields from classical input @xcite .",
    "therefore , engineering large optical nonlinearities has been a prime goal in experimental quantum optics throughout recent decades .",
    "since the propagation of light fields in vacuum is described by a linear wave equation , optical nonlinearities can only appear if light fields couple to a suitable medium .",
    "hence a strong nonlinearity requires a strong light matter coupling in the first place . very recently ,",
    "exceptionally strong light matter interactions have been realized in a variety of solid state optical devices @xcite .",
    "in fact these light matter interactions have reached coupling strengths that are comparable to the energy of the photons that interact with the matter , leading to a novel regime of light matter coupling that has been coined the ultra - strong coupling regime .",
    "ultra - strong light matter couplings in turn will also lead to optical nonlinearities of unprecedented strength .",
    "the characterization of the physics of optically ultra - nonlinear devices is therefore a very timely question of high interest @xcite .",
    "here we investigate the output photon statistics of optical nonlinearities for the regime where the anharmonicity of their frequency spectrum becomes comparable to the frequency of single photons . in our studies we focus on two paradigm examples of optical nonlinearities , a kerr nonlinearity @xcite and a @xmath1 nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "for the regime we are interested in , there is a significant difference between these two examples as no rotating wave approximation can be applied in the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the statistics of output photons for the ultra nonlinear devices we consider differs dramatically from the physics encountered in standard regimes where the anharmonicity of the spectrum is small compared to the photon frequency .",
    "there are two main reasons for these marked differences .",
    "first , photon dissipation is strongly modified for ultra strong nonlinearities . in each dissipation event",
    "the system loses a photon but in contrast to weak nonlinearities the frequency of the emitted photon strongly depends on how many photons are present inside the nonlinear device .",
    "this frequency dependence of the emission events needs to be taken into account properly @xcite .",
    "second , the frequency dependence of emitted photons also needs to be accounted for properly in the relation between the field in the device and an output field impinging on the detector .",
    "this requires properly generalized input - output relations @xcite .",
    "ultra - nonlinear devices for microwave photons are for example very nicely realized in circuit quantum electrodynamics . in particular hamiltonians as we consider them are realized in superconducting qubits , such as transmons @xcite or in a transmission line resonator where the central conductor is intersected by a direct current superconducting interference device ( dc squid ) @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we first introduce the model we consider which may be analyzed in two versions . in the first version it contains an utrastrong kerr nonlinearity for which we discuss the output photon statistics and spectra in section [ sec : kerr ] .",
    "the photon correlations and spectra of the second version containing a general @xmath1 nonlinearity that is quartic in the field are presented in section [ sec : full ] . in section [ sec : attractive ] we examine the photon correlations for the considered model with a negative @xmath1 nonlinearity , since some typical implementations such as superconducting qubits are described by it .",
    "we then conclude in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the steady state and emission statistical properties of a non - linear resonator coupled to a thermal reservoir .",
    "the most general hamiltonian that takes into account the nonlinearity of the system , consists of the harmonic part plus a standard power expansion of the potential energy with coefficients @xmath2 .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to models where the potential is symmetric around the point where the field vanishes so that only even powers of the field appear in the expansion of the potential .",
    "moreover we concentrate most of our discussion on cases where the nonlinearity is repulsive , i.e. @xmath3 for all @xmath4 , as this ensures that the energy of the system has a lower bound for arbitrary magnitudes of the @xmath5 and thus yields physically meaningful results for arbitrary field amplitudes .",
    "setting @xmath6 , this hamiltonian reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the bare mode frequency of the resonator and @xmath9 its annihilation operator . for moderate field amplitudes , that is , for regimes with moderate photon numbers ,",
    "the main physical effects due to the nonlinearity of the system are well described truncating such an expression to fourth order , i.e. @xmath10 which is the quantized version of the classical hamiltonian of the duffing oscillator @xcite .",
    "if the system we analyze is in a regime of weak perturbation , i.e. the number of total excitations is small , one argues that the off - diagonal terms in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) , like the squeezing terms @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are negligible as they create ( or destroy ) more than one excitation at a time . in this case",
    ", a further simplification leads to the well - known kerr - nonlinear hamiltonian , @xmath13    the exchange of excitations with a thermal bath with temperature @xmath14 is described in a master equation in the lindblad form , @xmath15 + \\mathcal{l}_t\\rho(t)\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath16 the density matrix of the resonator and the dot denoting a time derivative .",
