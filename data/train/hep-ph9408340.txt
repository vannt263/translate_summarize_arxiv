    "the production of high  transverse  momentum jets by quasi  real photons on protons is one of the major processes to gain further insight into the interactions of photons with quarks and gluons .",
    "experimental results by the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at hera have been presented , and more and better data are expected to come out soon .",
    "a subsample of these events are so  called _ large  rapidity  gap events _ , which have been discovered recently in photoproduction and deep  inelastic electroproduction in both hera experiments @xcite .",
    "their properties were found to be inconsistent with the dominant dynamical mechanism for the production of jets in photoproduction and deep ",
    "inelastic electroproduction , where colour is transferred between the produced quark and gluon jets and the proton remnant .",
    "whereas the majority of the events clustered around @xmath1 , a second class of events , with @xmath2 , were observed , i.e. , they had a large gap in rapidity between the fast moving proton , which in the moment is still an assumption , and the rest of the hadronic final state .",
    "( here , @xmath3 is the rapidity measured along the incoming  proton direction in the laboratory frame . ) the same type of events had been observed already some time ago in @xmath4 scattering @xcite .",
    "they were interpreted as being due to diffractive hard scattering , following a suggestion of ingelman and schlein @xcite . in this interpretation , which also applies to the large  rapidity  gap events at hera",
    ", the proton emits a pomeron which acts as a virtual target for the incoming hadron ( in the case of @xmath4 scattering ) and the quasi  real or highly virtual photon ( in the case of @xmath0 scattering ) , respectively .",
    "the incoming proton stays intact or becomes a low  mass state , so that there is no colour flow from the proton to the other final state particles .",
    "similarly to ordinary hadrons , mesons and baryons , the incoming pomeron is supposed to have a quark and/or a gluon structure , which is probed through electroweak or strong hard  scattering processes and expressed by a pomeron structure function .",
    "models based on different assumptions concerning this quark ",
    "gluon structure have been used for calculations of @xmath4 and @xmath0 scattering processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on these models , bruni and ingelman have developed a monte carlo program @xcite to study the event characteristics , which is already widely used by the hera collaborations to interpret their large ",
    "rapidity  gap data .",
    "if this interpretation is valid , a major task is to disentangle the quark and gluon distributions of the pomeron . as is the case in usual hard ",
    "scattering processes , one process is not sufficient to isolate the various parton densities .",
    "several processes must be considered simultaneously .",
    "inelastic diffractive @xmath0 scattering primarily measures the quark distribution of the pomeron , while the gluon structure function appears as a higher  order qcd correction .",
    "photoproduction of jets , however , is sensitive to both the quark and gluon densities already in the leading order ( lo ) of qcd . in lo , photoproduction has two components : a direct one and a resolved one .",
    "the latter mechanism has similar features as jet production in diffractive hadron ",
    "hadron scattering .",
    "the hadron structure function is just replaced by the photon structure function .",
    "all these processes can be studied in detail with the monte carlo program cited above .",
    "recently , a number of authors advocated the notion of a direct pomeron coupling to quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "donnachie and landshoff developed a model in which two gluons emitted coherently from the proton couple to the quark  antiquark system produced by the incoming real or virtual photon @xcite .",
    "the quark and antiquark thus give rise to two jets associated with the hard scattering .",
    "such configurations give a delta function in the pomeron structure function in the same way as direct photoproduction is equivalent to a delta  function term in the photon structure function of resolved photoproduction . since in the donnachie  landshoff model the second gluon of the pomeron is attached directly to the hard scattering , or to an outgoing parton , the result is higher twist , i.e. , considered as a function of @xmath5 , it falls off more strongly than in the case of a factorizable direct pomeron coupling .",
    "subsequently , several groups @xcite suggested other mechanisms which break the usual parton ",
    "model factorization and are effectively proportional to a delta  function term .",
    "these mechanisms , called _ coherent hard diffraction _ @xcite or _",
    "lossless diffractive jet production _",
    "@xcite , have the property that the total incoming longitudinal momentum of the pomeron is delivered to the jet system .",
    "both mechanisms produce leading  twist contributions and are not present in deep ",
    "inelastic electron ",
    "proton scattering , i.e. , in quasi  real photoproduction , which we are interested in here primarily , they would occur only in the resolved process .",
    "in addition , it is said explicitly that the cfs mechanism @xcite leads to a delta  function term only in the gluon density of the pomeron .",
    "so , these mechanisms for creating a quasi  direct pomeron coupling are very special and their validity is very difficult to assess .",
    "they are just conjectures and not proven consequences of qcd . under these circumstances",
    ", it is a challenge to look at experimental data in the diffractive region and to investigate whether such a direct pomeron coupling is present . to that end , it is necessary to establish features which are characteristic for a direct pomeron coupling to quarks and/or gluons in the data .",
    "this is the purpose of this work .    in section 2 , we formulate the model and give the relevant formulas for calculating the cross section for the production of jets in @xmath0 scattering with almost real photons .",
    "there , we specify the structure functions of the photon and the pomeron and write down the expression for the pomeron flux .",
    "if a direct pomeron coupling exists , this has also consequences for the diffractive contribution of the deep ",
    "inelastic structure function @xmath6 , which in retrospect modifies the input for the photoproduction cross section . in section 3 ,",
    "we present numerical results for the three scenarios : ( i ) resolved pomeron , ( ii ) resolved and direct pomeron , ( iii ) resolved and direct pomeron plus point  like component in the pomeron structure function .",
    "the last section is reserved for the conclusions and some outlook to future work .",
    "the cross section for the diffractive @xmath0 scattering process , depicted in fig .  [ dia ] , is obtained from the following parton model formula : [ d3s ] & & ( epjet+x ) + & = & _ a , b , c , ddx_g_/e(x _ ) dx_a g_a/(x_a ) dx_ip g_ip / p(x_ip ) dx_b g_b / ip(x_b ) + & & ( a+bc+d ) ( + + ) , where @xmath7 and @xmath5 are the rapidity and transverse momentum of the jet , respectively .",

    "for @xmath14 we use the ingelman ",

    "proton total cross section .",
    "other functional forms of @xmath14 are given in @xcite ; they are numerically equivalent in the region of small @xmath24 , which dominates the diffractive cross section .    for the unknown pomeron structure functions , @xmath25",
    ", we make the ansatz [ ipsf ] g_u / ip(x ) & = & g_/ip(x ) = g_d / ip(x ) = g_/ip(x ) = ( 1-x ) , + g_s / ip(x ) & = & g_/ip(x ) = ( 1-x ) , g_c / ip(x ) = g_/ip(x ) = 0 , + g_g / ip(x ) & = & ( 1-x ) . the gluon component fulfills _ 0 ^ 1 dxx g_g / ip(x ) = , and the quark components have the normalization _",

    "/ ip(x ) ) = 1 , which is usually assumed also by other authors @xcite .",
    "since the exchanged pomeron is not a physical particle , there is no rigid justification for this sum rule , although some motivation can be given .",

    "the gluon content of the pomeron contributes to ddis through the order @xmath26 process @xmath27 and is therefore suppressed .",
    "this means that , in a first approximation , ddis is determined by the quark and antiquark components of the pomeron structure function .",
    "the gluon component enters when the pomeron structure function is evolved to larger @xmath28 , which , however , we shall not perform in the crude study presented here .    for the calculation of the photoproduction of jets , we need the hard  scattering cross sections @xmath29 in ( [ d3s ] ) .",
    "we consider four components , dd , dr , rd , rr .",

    "real photon interacts directly ( d ) or as a resolved photon ( r ) with the incoming quarks and gluons .",

    "we restrict ourselves to a direct coupling with quarks ( antiquarks ) of the form [ lint ] _ int = c(x ) _",
    "q(x)^(x ) . here",
    "@xmath32 is the coupling constant . in ( [ lint ] )",
    ", we assumed that the pomeron , @xmath33 , couples to quarks like a vector particle .",
    "this contradicts the fact that the pomeron behaves like a @xmath34 exchange , whereas ( [ lint ] ) transforms invariantly under @xmath35 only if @xmath33 has @xmath36 .",
    "it is an old observation , however , that , in soft processes like diffractive scattering , the pomeron couples to quarks effectively rather like an isoscalar photon , i.e. , with a constant @xmath37 coupling but with a regge signature factor , which endows it with even @xmath35 parity @xcite . with this ansatz ,",
    "donnachie and landshoff were able to give a realistic description of all high  energy elastic and diffractive cross sections applying the additive quark model and including less dominant regge exchanges @xcite .",
    "pomeron exchange with the coupling of ( [ lint ] ) also correctly predicts the approximate helicity conservation that is observed experimentally .",
    "with such a coupling , we obtain the following hard  scattering cross section of @xmath38 , written in terms of the invariants , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , introduced earlier : [ dsdt ] ( ipq ) = 6e^2e_q^2 c^2 ( + + ) , where @xmath42 is the electric charge of @xmath43 in units of the positron charge , @xmath44 . here",

    "the cross section decreases only like @xmath51 , i.e. , it exhibits a rather mild @xmath5 dependence .",
    "furthermore , the rapidity is completely fixed by @xmath5 and @xmath39 . under the assumption that the pomeron couples like a scalar particle ( this would not allow the description of elastic and diffractive scattering proposed in @xcite ) , ( [ dsdp ] ) would only change slightly to ( ipq ) = 6e^2e_q^2 c^2 , i.e. , for @xmath52 the result coincides with the one for the vector coupling . in the following , we shall assume that the direct pomeron coupling is characterized by ( [ lint ] ) , i.e. , we shall employ ( [ dsdp ] ) for the hard  collision cross section .    in our model for the direct pomeron coupling , the pomeron behaves like a real photon target for @xmath53 . similarly to @xmath54 scattering , the @xmath38 cross section also contributes to the pomeron structure function , i.e. , to deep ",

    "the dd component has a much slower fall  off in @xmath5 as compared to the dr component and dominates the other components for @xmath153 .",
    "this harder @xmath5 dependence is expected , since the hard  scattering cross section of @xmath38 is proportional to @xmath51 . in the dr component , this dependence is softened through the pomeron structure functions .",
    "the two  jet cross sections show an almost identical pattern , since the additional restriction for the second jet is less effective , if @xmath7 is held fixed near the maximum of the rapidity distribution .",
    "the shallow @xmath5 dependence of the dd ( and , to a minor extent , of the rd ) component is still visible in the sum over all components .",

    "[ sumpts]a , b for the inclusive one  jet and two  jet cross sections , respectively , when we compare the curves for @xmath80 and @xmath95 . in figs .",

    "[ sumyds]a , we can only compare the shapes .",
    "the points with lowest @xmath5 are adjusted so as to match approximately with the theoretical curves , again using a normalization factor of 1/2 .",
    "the data seem to show the shallow @xmath5 dependence characteristic for the combined direct  pomeron contribution , dd @xmath151 rd .",
    "however , this observation should be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "firstly , these data are uncorrected . secondly , for a serious comparison , our model should include hadronization , which is certainly important for the low effective c.m .",
    "energies in the @xmath154 channel .",
    "therefore , we believe that it is premature to draw any firm conclusions from these comparisons .",
    "there are two other features in the zeus data that are indicative of a direct pomeron coupling .",
    "the @xmath155 distribution is peaked near @xmath156 , and the @xmath157 distribution , i.e. , the dependence on the pomeron  structure  function variable @xmath157 , has also a maximum near @xmath158 . but also here",
    ", conclusions can be drawn only when corrected data are available and hadronization effects are included in our model .",
    "in this work , we studied the effect of a direct pomeron coupling to quarks , which leads to lossless diffractive jet production .",
    "we considered @xmath0 scattering under hera conditions with almost real photons .",
    "we tried to conform to the experimental conditions of the h1 and zeus experiments as much as possible .",
    "only lo processes were investigated , and the hadronization of the parton jets was neglected . the most important signature of a direct pomeron coupling is the @xmath5 distribution in inclusive one  jet and two  jet production .",
    "it leads to a much flatter @xmath5 distribution than in the case of a resolved pomeron .",
    "the direct photon coupling gives the dominant contribution at @xmath153 .",
    "most of our results are model ",
    "dependent , since we have no a ",
    "priori knowledge about the strength of the pomeron coupling and about the relation of the quark to the gluon components of the pomeron structure function .",
    "we considered the gluon part to be dominant over the quark part in the ratio @xmath159 .",
    "so far , the existing preliminary experimental information on jet production with almost real photons in rapidity  gap events observed by h1 and zeus is consistent with this assumption .",
    "definite conclusions are not possible at this time , since these data are not yet corrected and our model does not contain hadronization corrections , which are likely to be important at these low energies in the @xmath154 c.m .  system .",
    "we are aware of the fact that the assumption of a direct pomeron coupling to quarks is quite unconventional , since the pomeron is a very complex object , which , at first hand , is not expected to behave similarly to a photon . on the other hand",
    ", theory can not guide us .",
    "so , only data can tell whether our assumptions are realistic .",
    "there exist several modifications of the ideas presented in this work .",
    "firstly , the direct pomeron coupling to quarks could contain an additional form factor which depends on @xmath5 . in this case",
    ", we would expect that the @xmath5 dependence of the dd component is not as flat as in fig .",
    "therefore , it would be much harder to detect such a direct coupling .",
    "secondly , the direct coupling of the pomeron might be to gluons and not to quarks  or to both . for a direct gluon coupling of the pomeron ,",
    "the direct  photon contribution does not exist in lo .",
    "therefore , such a coupling could be seen only in connection with a resolved photon .",
    "of course , for this case , there is also no point  like component in the pomeron structure function .",
    "if direct pomeron couplings both to quarks and to gluons exist , it will be difficult to disentangle the two .",
    "it is conceivable that , when the experimental range of @xmath121 can be increased , also other regge exchanges between the primary proton vertex and the hard  scattering process will become relevant .",
    "such exchanges , like @xmath160 , @xmath161 , etc . , have been considered in the past as a method for extracting the deep ",
    "inelastic structure of reggeons @xcite when the incoming photon is highly virtual .",
    "such exchanges are also possible in @xmath0 scattering with almost real photons . in this case , a direct @xmath160 ( @xmath161 , etc . )",
    "coupling to quarks is even more natural than a direct pomeron coupling to quarks . actually , in a recent publication @xcite by the e683 collaboration at fermilab on jet production by real photons in the fixed ",
    "target energy range , it is reported that the energy flow in the photon ( forward ) direction is very similar in @xmath162 and @xmath163 reactions at comparable energies . since @xmath162 processes at such low c.m .",
    "energies are dominated by _",
    "photoproduction , this result can be interpreted by assuming that also the pion has an appreciable direct coupling to quarks , in contrast to nave expectations .",
    "similar results were reported earlier by the e609 collaboration @xcite for hard @xmath163 collisions at @xmath164 on a fixed target .",
    "these authors found evidence for two  jet events with little or no energy flow in the forward direction .",
    "they interpreted these results in terms of a higher  twist process suggested by berger and brodsky @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the pion structure function has a delta  function component with a form factor that is related to the electromagnetic form factor of the pion . except for these higher  twist factors , which reduce the cross section and",
    "produce a steeper @xmath5 dependence , the cross section has the same characteristics as the one of jet production in @xmath162 collisions with a direct photon .",
    "it is possible that the pomeron , too , has such a higher  twist component .",
    "this means that , independently of whether the pomeron model with a leading  twist direct coupling proposed in this work is true or not , it might be reasonable to look for lossless diffractive jet production in @xmath0 collisions , which could be a signature for a higher  twist direct coupling .",
    "we remark that the c.m .",
    "energies in the @xmath162 collisions considered in this work are of the same order as those in the @xmath163 fixed  target experiments .",
