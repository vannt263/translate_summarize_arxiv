    "latest observational missions , planck and herschel are further providing data with even more sensitivity , opening newer windows for understanding , how the universe evolved . there has been a persistent effort to re - examine and refine the possibilities of improved theoretical input to these parameters .",

    "the weak interactions given below played a major role @xcite-@xcite in regulating the relative number of protons and neutrons : @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5    during the primordial era of nucleosynthesis , temperature was high enough for the mean energy per particle to be greater than the binding energy of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 mev ) thereby any @xmath6 formed was immediately destroyed .",

    "the abundances of light elements got fixed and only changed as some of the radioactive products of bbn such as @xmath9 decayed .",
    "theory of bbn provides a detailed description on production of @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath1 , and @xmath12 as well as precise quantitative predictions for their abundances .",
