    "bosonic systems at very low temperature are characterized by the fact that a macroscopic fraction of the particles collapses into a single one - particle state .",
    "although this phenomenon , known as bose - einstein condensation , was already predicted in the early days of quantum mechanics , the first empirical evidence for its existence was only obtained in 1995 , in experiments performed by groups led by cornell and wieman at the university of colorado at boulder and by ketterle at mit ( see @xcite ) . in these important experiments ,",
    "atomic gases were initially trapped by magnetic fields and cooled down at very low temperatures . then the magnetic traps were switched off and the consequent time evolution of the gas",
    "was observed ; for sufficiently small temperatures , the particles remained close together and the gas moved as a single particle , a clear sign for the existence of condensation .    in the last years important",
    "progress has also been achieved in the theoretical understanding of bose - einstein condensation . in @xcite ,",
    "lieb , yngvason , and seiringer considered a trapped bose gas consisting of @xmath0 three - dimensional particles described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an external confining potential and @xmath3 is a repulsive interaction potential with scattering length @xmath4 ( here and in the rest of the paper we use the notation @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . letting @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 fixed",
    ", they showed that the ground state energy @xmath10 of ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) divided by the number of particle @xmath0 converges to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gross - pitaevskii energy functional @xmath13 later , in @xcite , lieb and seiringer also proved that trapped bose gases characterized by the gross - pitaevskii scaling @xmath14 exhibit bose - einstein condensation in the ground state .",
    "more precisely , they showed that , if @xmath15 is the ground state wave function of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) and if @xmath16 denotes the corresponding one - particle marginal ( defined as the partial trace of the density matrix @xmath17 over the last @xmath18 particles , with the convention that @xmath19 for all @xmath0 ) , then @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the minimizer of the gross - pitaevskii energy functional ( [ eq : gpfunc ] ) .",
    "the interpretation of this result is straightforward ; in the limit of large @xmath0 , all particles , apart from a fraction vanishing as @xmath22 , are in the same one - particle state described by the wave - function @xmath21 . in this sense",
    "the ground state of ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) exhibits complete bose - einstein condensation into @xmath23 .    in joint works with l. erds and h .-",
    "yau ( see @xcite ) , we prove that the gross - pitaevskii theory can also be used to describe the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates . in the gross - pitaevskii scaling",
    "( characterized by the fact that the scattering length of the interaction potential is of the order @xmath24 ) we show , under some conditions on the interaction potential and on the initial @xmath0-particle wave function , that complete bose - einstein condensation is preserved by the time evolution .",
    "moreover we prove that the dynamics of the condensate wave function is governed by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation associated with the energy functional ( [ eq : gpfunc ] ) .    as an example , consider the experimental set - up described above , where the dynamics of an initially confined gas is observed after removing the traps .",
    "mathematically , the trapped gas can be described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) , where the confining potential @xmath2 models the magnetic traps .",
    "when cooled down at very low temperatures , the system essentially relaxes to the ground state @xmath15 of ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) ; from @xcite it follows that at time @xmath25 , immediately before switching off the traps , the system exhibits complete bose - einstein condensation into @xmath23 in the sense ( [ eq : conden ] ) . at time",
    "@xmath25 the traps are turned off , and one observes the evolution of the system generated by the translation invariant hamiltonian @xmath26 our results ( stated in more details in section [ sec : main ] below ) imply that , if @xmath27 is the time evolution of the initial wave function @xmath15 and if @xmath28 denotes the one - particle marginal associated with @xmath29 , then , for any fixed time @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the solution of the nonlinear time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath33 with the initial data @xmath34 . in other words ,",
    "we prove that at arbitrary time @xmath30 , the system still exhibits complete condensation , and the time - evolution of the condensate wave function is determined by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ eq : gp1 ] ) .",
    "the goal of this manuscript is to illustrate the main ideas of the proof of the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : heu ] we define the model more precisely , and we give a heuristic argument to explain the emergence of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ eq : gp1 ] ) . in section  [ sec : main ] we present our main results . in section  [ sec :",
    "proof ] we illustrate the general strategy used to prove the main results and , finally , in sections  [ sec : conv ] and [ sec : unique ] we discuss the two most important parts of the proof in some more details .",
    "to describe the interaction among the particles we choose a positive , spherical symmetric , compactly supported , smooth function @xmath35 .",
    "we denote the scattering length of @xmath36 by @xmath37 .",
    "recall that the scattering length of @xmath36 is defined by the spherical symmetric solution to the zero energy equation @xmath38 the scattering length of @xmath36 is defined then by @xmath39 this limit can be proven to exist if @xmath36 decays sufficiently fast at infinity .",
    "note that , since we assumed @xmath36 to have compact support , we have @xmath40 for @xmath41 sufficiently large .",
    "another equivalent characterization of the scattering length is given by @xmath42    to recover the gross - pitaevskii scaling , we define @xmath43 . by scaling it is clear that the scattering length of @xmath44 equals @xmath45 .",
    "in fact if @xmath46 is the solution to ( [ eq:0en ] ) , it is clear that @xmath47 solves @xmath48 with the boundary condition @xmath49 as @xmath50 .",
    "from ( [ eq : f ] ) , we obtain @xmath51 for @xmath41 large enough . in particular the scattering length @xmath4 of @xmath44 is given by @xmath52 .",
    "we consider the dynamics generated by the translation invariant hamiltonian @xmath53 acting on the hilbert space @xmath54 , the bosonic subspace of @xmath55 consisting of all permutation symmetric functions ( although it is possible to extend our analysis to include an external potential , to keep the discussion as simple as possible we only consider the translation invariant case ( [ eq : ham ] ) ) .",
    "we consider solutions @xmath29 of the @xmath0-body schrdinger equation @xmath56 let @xmath57 denote the density matrix associated with @xmath29 , defined as the orthogonal projection onto @xmath29 . in order to study the limit @xmath7",
    ", we introduce the marginal densities of @xmath58 . for @xmath59 , we define the @xmath60-particle density matrix @xmath61 associated with @xmath29 by taking the partial trace of @xmath58 over the last @xmath62 particles . in other words , @xmath61 is defined as the positive trace class operator on @xmath63 with kernel given by @xmath64 here and in the rest of the paper we use the notation @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "we consider initial wave functions @xmath69 exhibiting complete condensation in a one - particle state @xmath70 .",
    "thus at time @xmath25 , we assume that @xmath71 it turns out that the last equation immediately implies that @xmath72 for every fixed @xmath73 ( the argument , due to lieb and seiringer , can be found in @xcite , after theorem  1 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the convergence ( [ eq : gm1 ] ) ( and ( [ eq : gmk ] ) ) in the trace class norm is equivalent to the convergence in the weak * topology defined on the space of trace class operators on @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 , for ( [ eq : gmk ] ) ) ; we thank a. michelangeli for pointing out this fact to us ( the proof is based on general arguments , such as grmm s convergence theorem ) .    starting from the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : schr ] ) for the wave function @xmath29",
    ", we can derive evolution equations for the marginal densities @xmath61 .",

    "next we study the limit @xmath7 of the density @xmath79 for fixed @xmath73 . for simplicity",
    "we fix @xmath80 . from ( [ eq : bbgky ] ) , the evolution equation for the one - particle density matrix , written in terms of its kernel @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 suppose now that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are limit points ( with respect to the weak * topology ) of @xmath28 and , respectively , @xmath85 as @xmath7 . since , formally , @xmath86 as @xmath22 , we could naively expect the limit points @xmath87 and @xmath84 to satisfy the limiting equation @xmath88 from ( [ eq : gmk ] ) we have , at time @xmath25 , @xmath89 if condensation is really preserved by the time evolution , also at time @xmath90 we have @xmath91 inserting ( [ eq : condt ] ) in ( [ eq : wrong ] ) , we obtain the self - consistent equation @xmath92 for the condensate wave function @xmath32 .",
    "this equation has the same form as the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ eq : gp1 ] ) , but a different coefficient in front of the nonlinearity ( @xmath93 instead of @xmath94 ) .",
    "the reason why we obtain the wrong coupling constant in ( [ eq : b0 ] ) is that going from ( [ eq : bbgky-1 ] ) to ( [ eq : wrong ] ) , we took the two limits @xmath95 independently from each other .",
    "however , since the scattering length of the interaction is of the order @xmath24 , the two - particle density @xmath85 develops a short scale correlation structure on the length scale @xmath24 , which is exactly the same length scale on which the potential @xmath44 varies .",
    "for this reason the two limits in ( [ eq : lims ] ) can not be taken independently . in order to obtain the correct gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ eq : gp1 ] ) we need to take into account the correlations among the particles , and the short scale structure they create in the marginal density @xmath96 .    to describe the correlations among the particles we make use of the solution @xmath97 to the zero energy scattering equation ( [ eq:0en - n ] ) .",
    "assuming that the function @xmath98 gives a good approximation for the correlations between particles @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we may expect that the one- and two - particle densities associated with the evolution of a condensate are given , for large but finite @xmath0 , by @xmath101 inserting this ansatz into ( [ eq : bbgky-1 ] ) , we obtain a new self - consistent equation @xmath102 because of ( [ eq:8pia0 ] ) . this is exactly the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ eq : gp1 ] ) , with the correct coupling constant in front of the nonlinearity .",
    "note that the presence of the correlation functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 in ( [ eq : gam12 ] ) does not contradict complete condensation of the system at time @xmath105 . on the contrary , in the weak limit @xmath7",
    ", the function @xmath106 converges to one , and therefore @xmath107 and @xmath85 converge to @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively . the correlations described by the function @xmath106 can only produce nontrivial effects on the macroscopic dynamics of the system because of the singularity of the interaction potential @xmath44 .    from this heuristic argument it is clear that , in order to obtain a rigorous derivation of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ eq : gp2 ] ) , we need to identify the short scale structure of the marginal densities and prove that , in a very good approximation , it can be described by the function @xmath106 as in ( [ eq : gam12 ] ) . in other words , we need to show a very strong separation of scales in the marginal density @xmath85 ( and , more generally , in the @xmath60-particle density @xmath79 ) associated with the solution of the @xmath0-body schrdinger equation ; the gross - pitaevskii theory can only be correct if @xmath79 has a regular part , which factorizes for large @xmath0 into the product of @xmath60 copies of the orthogonal projection @xmath110 , and a time independent singular part , due to the correlations among the particles , and described by products of the functions @xmath98 , @xmath111 .",
    "to prove our main results we need to assume the interaction potential to be sufficiently weak . to measure the strength of the potential , we introduce the dimensionless quantity @xmath112 apart from the smallness assumption on the potential , we also need to assume that the correlations characterizing the initial @xmath0-particle wave function are sufficiently weak .",
    "we define therefore the notion of _ asymptotically factorized _ wave functions .",

    "of course , when the wave function develops correlations on the length scale @xmath24 , the energy associated with this length scale decreases ; since the total energy is conserved by the schrdinger evolution , we must conclude that together with the short scale structure at scales of order @xmath24 , the @xmath0-body dynamics also produces oscillations on intermediate length scales @xmath134 , which carry the excess energy ( the difference between the energy of the factorized wave function and the energy of the wave function with correlations on the length scale @xmath24 ) and which have no effect on the macroscopic dynamics ( because only variations of the wave function on length scales of order one and order @xmath24 affect the macroscopic dynamics described by the gross - pitaevskii equation ) .",

    "but of course , in order to apply the uniqueness result to prove theorem [ thm : main ] , we need to make sure that any limit point of the sequence @xmath186 is in the class for which we can prove uniqueness .",
    "[ prop : aprik ] assume the same conditions as in proposition [ prop : enest ] .",

    "the main difficulty in proving proposition [ prop : aprik ] is the fact that the estimate ( [ eq : aprik3 ] ) does not hold true if we replace @xmath153 by the marginal density @xmath79 .",

    "in fact , for finite @xmath0 and @xmath260 , the @xmath60-particle density @xmath61 still contains the short scale structure due to the correlations among the particles .",
    "therefore , when we take derivatives of @xmath61 as in ( [ eq : aprwrong ] ) , the singular structure ( which varies on a length scale of order @xmath24 ) generates contributions which diverge in the limit @xmath7 .    to overcome this problem",

    "the point is that , while proposition [ prop : enest ] is used to identify the two - particle correlations in the marginal densities @xmath61 ( which are essential for the emergence of the scattering length @xmath37 in the infinite hierarchy ( [ eq : gphier ] ) ) , we only need proposition [ prop : highen ] to establish properties of the limiting densities ; this is why we can introduce cutoffs in ( [ eq : highen ] ) , provided we can show their effect to vanish in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "note that we can allow one `` free derivative '' ; in ( [ eq : highen ] ) we take the derivative over @xmath279 although there is no cutoff @xmath280 .",

    "the proof of proposition [ prop : highen ] is based on induction over @xmath60 ; for details see section 9 in @xcite .    from the estimates ( [ eq : highen ] ) , using the preservation of the expectation of @xmath283 along the time evolution and a regularization of the initial @xmath0-particle wave function @xmath284 , we obtain the following bounds for the solution @xmath285 of the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : schr ] ) . @xmath286",
    "uniformly in @xmath0 and @xmath105 , and for all @xmath114 . translating these bounds in the language of the density matrix @xmath58 , we obtain @xmath287 the idea now is to use the freedom in the choice of the cutoff length @xmath261 .",

    "this approach yields in fact the desired results ; starting from ( [ eq : cutoffs ] ) , and choosing @xmath261 such that @xmath292 , we can complete the proof of proposition [ prop : aprik ] ( see proposition 6.3 in @xcite for more details ) .      to prove theorem [ thm : unique ] , we start by rewriting the infinite hierarchy ( [ eq : gphier ] ) in the integral form @xmath293 \\ , \\\\&= { { \\cal u}}^{(k ) } ( t ) \\gamma_{0 } + \\int_0^t { { \\rm d}}s \\ ; { { \\cal u}}^{(k ) } ( t - s ) \\ , b^{(k ) } \\gamma^{(k+1)}_{s } \\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath294 denotes the free evolution of @xmath60 particles , @xmath295 and the collision operator @xmath296 maps @xmath78-particle operators into @xmath60-particle operators according to @xmath297\\ ] ] ( recall that @xmath77 denotes the partial trace over the @xmath78-th particle ) .",

    "to prove the uniqueness of the infinite hierarchy , it is enough to prove that the error term ( [ eq : eta ] ) converges to zero as @xmath303 ( in some norm , or even only after testing it against a sufficiently large class of smooth observables ) .",
    "the main problem here is that the delta function in the collision operator @xmath296 can not be controlled by the kinetic energy ( in the sense that , in three dimensions , the operator inequality @xmath304 does not hold true ) .",
    "for this reason , the a - priori estimates @xmath305 are not sufficient to show that ( [ eq : eta ] ) converges to zero , as @xmath306 .",
    "instead , we have to make use of the smoothing effects of the free evolutions @xmath307 in ( [ eq : eta ] ) ( in a similar way , stricharzt estimates are used to prove the well - posedness of nonlinear schrdinger equations ) .",
    "to this end , we rewrite each term in the series ( [ eq : duhamel ] ) as a sum of contributions associated with certain feynman graphs , and then we prove the convergence of the duhamel expansion by controlling each contribution separately .",
    "the details of the diagrammatic expansion can be found in section 9 of @xcite .",
    "here we only present the main ideas .",
    "we start by considering the term @xmath308 in ( [ eq : xi ] ) . after multiplying it with a compact @xmath60-particle observable @xmath191 and taking the trace ,",
    "we expand the result as @xmath309 where @xmath310 is the contribution associated with the feynman graph @xmath311 . here",
    "@xmath312 denotes the set of all graphs consisting of @xmath313 disjoint , paired , oriented , and rooted trees with @xmath314 vertices .",
    "an example of a graph in @xmath312 is drawn in figure [ fig : feynman ] .",
    "each vertex has one of the two forms drawn in figure [ fig : feynman ] , with one `` father''-edge on the left ( closer to the root of the tree ) and three `` son''-edges on the right .",
    "one of the son edge is marked ( the one drawn on the same level as the father edge ; the other two son edges are drawn below ) .",
    "graphs in @xmath312 have @xmath315 edges , @xmath313 roots ( the edges on the very left ) , and @xmath316 leaves ( the edges on the very right ) .",
    "it is possible to show that the number of different graphs in @xmath312 is bounded by @xmath317 .",
    "the particular form of the graphs in @xmath312 is due to the quantum mechanical nature of the expansion ; the presence of a commutator in the collision operator ( [ eq : b ] ) implies that , for every @xmath318 in ( [ eq : xi ] ) , we can choose whether to write the interaction on the left or on the right of the density .",
    "when we draw the corresponding vertex in a graph in @xmath312 , we have to choose whether to attach it on the incoming or on the outgoing edge .",
    "graphs in @xmath312 are characterized by a natural partial ordering among the vertices ( @xmath319 if the vertex @xmath162 is on the path from @xmath320 to the roots ) ; there is , however , no total ordering .",
    "the absence of total ordering among the vertices is the consequence of a rearrangement of the summands on the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : xi ] )",
    "; by removing the order between times associated with non - ordered vertices we significantly reduce the number of terms in the expansion .",
    "in fact , while ( [ eq : xi ] ) contains @xmath321 summands , in ( [ eq : expa ] ) we are only summing over @xmath317 contributions .",
    "the price we have to pay is that the apparent gain of a factor @xmath322 because of the ordering of the time integrals in ( [ eq : xi ] ) is lost in the new expansion ( [ eq : expa ] ) .",
    "however , since the time integrations are already needed to smooth out singularities , and since they can not be used simultaneously for smoothing and for gaining a factor @xmath322 , it seems very difficult to make use of the apparent factor @xmath322 in ( [ eq : xi ] ) .",
    "in fact , we find that the expansion ( [ eq : expa ] ) is better suited for analyzing the cumulative space - time smoothing effects of the multiple free evolutions than ( [ eq : xi ] ) .",
    "because of the pairing of the @xmath313 trees , there is a natural pairing between the @xmath313 roots of the graph .",
    "moreover , it is also possible to define a natural pairing of the leaves of the graph ( this is evident in figure [ fig : feynman ] ) ; two leaves @xmath323 and @xmath324 are paired if there exists an edge @xmath325 on the path from @xmath323 back to the roots , and an edge @xmath326 on the path from @xmath324 to the roots , such that @xmath325 and @xmath326 are the two unmarked son - edges of the same vertex ( or , if there is no unmarked sons in the path from @xmath323 and @xmath324 to the roots , if the two roots connected to @xmath323 and @xmath324 are paired ) .",
    "for @xmath327 , we denote by @xmath328 , @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath331 the set of all edges , vertices , roots and , respectively , leaves in the graph @xmath311 . for every edge @xmath332",
    ", we introduce a three - dimensional momentum variable @xmath333 and a one - dimensional frequency variable @xmath334 .",
    "then , denoting by @xmath335 and by @xmath336 the kernels of the density @xmath337 and of the observable @xmath191 in fourier space , the contribution @xmath310 in ( [ eq : expa ] ) is given by @xmath338 here @xmath339 , according to the orientation of the edge @xmath340 .",
    "we observe from ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) that the momenta of the roots of @xmath311 are the variables of the kernel of @xmath191 , while the momenta of the leaves of @xmath311 are the variables of the kernel of @xmath337 ( this also explain why roots and leaves of @xmath311 need to be paired ) .",
    "the denominators @xmath341 are called propagators ; they correspond to the free evolutions in the expansion ( [ eq : xi ] ) and they enter the expression ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) through the formula @xmath342 ( here and in ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) the measure @xmath343 is defined by @xmath344 where @xmath345 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath346 ) .",
    "the regularization factors @xmath347 in ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) have to be chosen such that @xmath348 at every vertex .",
    "the delta - functions in ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) express momentum and frequency conservation ( the sum over @xmath349 denotes the sum over all edges adjacent to the vertex @xmath162 ; here @xmath350 if the edge points towards the vertex , while @xmath351 if the edge points out of the vertex , and analogously for @xmath352 ) .",
    "an analogous expansion can be obtained for the error term @xmath353 in ( [ eq : eta ] ) .",
    "the problem now is to analyze the integral ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) ( and the corresponding integral for the error term ) . through an appropriate choice of the regularization factors",
    "@xmath347 one can extract the time dependence of @xmath310 and show that @xmath354 where we introduced the notation @xmath355 .",
    "because of the singularity of the interaction at zero , we may be faced here with an ultraviolet problem ; we have to show that all integrations in ( [ eq : bound1 ] ) are finite in the regime of large momenta and large frequency . because of ( [ eq : aprit0 ] ) , we know that the kernel @xmath356 in ( [ eq : bound1 ] ) provides decay in the momenta of the leaves . from ( [ eq : aprit0 ] ) we have , in momentum space , @xmath357 for all @xmath358 .",
    "power counting implies that @xmath359 using this decay in the momenta of the leaves and the decay of the propagators @xmath360 , we can prove the finiteness of all the momentum and frequency integrals in ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) .",
    "heuristically , this can be seen using a simple power counting argument .",
    "fix @xmath361 , and cutoff all momenta @xmath362 and all frequencies @xmath363 .",
    "each @xmath333-integral scales then as @xmath364 , and each @xmath334-integral scales as @xmath365 .",
    "since we have @xmath315 edges in @xmath311 , we have @xmath315 momentum- and frequency integrations .",
    "however , because of the @xmath314 delta functions ( due to momentum and frequency conservation ) , we effectively only have to perform @xmath316 momentum- and frequency - integrations .",
    "therefore the whole integral in ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) carries a volume factor of the order @xmath366 . now , since there are @xmath316 leaves in the graph @xmath311 , the estimate ( [ eq : bound2 ] ) guarantees a decay of the order @xmath367 .",
    "the @xmath315 propagators , on the other hand , provide a decay of the order @xmath368 . choosing the observable @xmath191 so that @xmath336 decays sufficiently fast at infinity , we can also gain an additional decay @xmath369 . since @xmath370 for @xmath361",
    ", we can expect ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) to converge in the large momentum and large frequency regime .",
    "remark the importance of the decay provided by the free evolution ( through the propagators ) ; without making use of it , we would not be able to prove the uniqueness of the infinite hierarchy .",
    "this heuristic argument is clearly far from rigorous . to obtain a rigorous proof",
    ", we use an integration scheme dictated by the structure of the graph @xmath311 ; we start by integrating the momenta and the frequency of the leaves ( for which ( [ eq : bound2 ] ) provides sufficient decay ) .",
    "the point here is that when we perform the integrations over the momenta of the leaves we have to propagate the decay to the next edges on the left .",
    "we move iteratively from the right to the left of the graph , until we reach the roots ; at every step we integrate the frequencies and momenta of the son edges of a fixed vertex and as a result we obtain decay in the momentum of the father edge .",
    "when we reach the roots , we use the decay of the kernel @xmath336 to complete the integration scheme . in a typical step ,",
    "we consider a vertex as the one drawn in figure [ fig:2 ] and we assume to have decay in the momenta of the three son - edges , in the form @xmath371 , @xmath372 ( for some @xmath373 )",
    ". then we integrate over the frequencies @xmath374 and the momenta @xmath375 of the son - edges and as a result we obtain a decaying factor @xmath376 in the momentum of the father edge .",
    "in other words , we prove bounds of the form @xmath377 power counting implies that ( [ eq : scheme ] ) can only be correct if @xmath378 . on the other hand , to start the integration scheme we need @xmath379 ( from ( [ eq : bound2 ] ) this is the decay in the momenta of the leaves , obtained from the a - priori estimates ) .",
    "it turns out that , choosing @xmath380 for a sufficiently small  @xmath381 , ( [ eq : scheme ] ) can be made precise , and the integration scheme can be completed .    after integrating all the frequency and momentum variables , from ( [ eq : bound1 ] ) we obtain that @xmath382 for every @xmath383 . since the number of diagrams in @xmath312 is bounded by @xmath384 , it follows immediately that @xmath385 note that , from ( [ eq : xi ] ) , one may expect @xmath308 to be proportional to @xmath386 .",
    "the reason why we only get a bound proportional to @xmath387 is that we effectively use part of the time integration to control the singularity of the potentials .",
    "note that the only property of @xmath337 used in the analysis of ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) is the estimate ( [ eq : aprit0 ] ) , which provides the necessary decay in the momenta of the leaves .",
    "however , since the a - priori bound ( [ eq : apri ] ) hold uniformly in time , we can use a similar argument to bound the contribution arising from the error term @xmath353 in ( [ eq : eta ] ) ( as explained above , also @xmath353 can be expanded analogously to ( [ eq : expa ] ) , with contributions associated to feynman graphs similar to ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) ; the difference , of course , is that these contributions will depend on @xmath388 for all @xmath389 $ ] , while ( [ eq : contrilam ] ) only depends on the initial data ) .",
    "thus , we also obtain @xmath390 this bound immediately implies the uniqueness .",
    "in fact , given two solutions @xmath391 and @xmath392 of the infinite hierarchy ( [ eq : gphier ] ) , both satisfying the a - priori bounds ( [ eq : apri ] ) and with the same initial data , we can expand both in a duhamel series of order @xmath298 as in ( [ eq : duhamel ] ) .",
    "if we fix @xmath114 , and consider the difference between @xmath393 and @xmath394 , all terms ( [ eq : xi ] ) cancel out because they only depend on the initial data .",
    "therefore , from ( [ eq : errorbound ] ) , we immediately obtain that , for arbitrary ( sufficiently smooth ) compact @xmath60-particle operators @xmath191 , @xmath395 since it is independent of @xmath298 , the left side has to vanish for all @xmath396 .",
    "this proves uniqueness for short times .",
