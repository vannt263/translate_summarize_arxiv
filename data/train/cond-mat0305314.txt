    "a spin - glass ( sg ) phenomenon has been attracting great interest both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "applications now cover a wide range of interdisciplinary fields of statistical physics and informational physics , as treated in this special issue . however , many subjects are not well understood , in spite of efforts made over almost thirty years .",
    "one of these subjects is whether or not the sg transition of real materials can be explained by a simple random - bond spin model .",
    "spins of many sg materials are well - approximated by the heisenberg spins .",
    "the simplest theoretical model is the heisenberg model with random nearest - neighbour interactions .",
    "however , numerical studies suggest that there is no finite - temperature sg transition in this model @xcite .",
    "kawamura @xcite proposed the chirality mechanism in order to solve this discrepancy .",
    "the chiral - glass ( cg ) transition occurs without the sg order .",
    "a small but finite random anisotropy in the real materials mixes the chirality degrees of freedom and the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this anisotropy effect induces the sg transition observed in the real materials .",
    "the scenario is based upon results that the sg transition does not occur in the isotropic model . however , matsubara et al .",
    "@xcite recalculated the domain - wall excess energy and the sg susceptibility , from which they suggested that the finite - temperature sg transition does possibly occur .",
    "methods are quite similar to the previous ones @xcite .",
    "subtle differences in the analyses of the obtained data drew an opposite conclusion .",
    "the spin - glass problem is one of the most difficult subjects in computational physics . it can be a tough bench - mark test for a new numerical method .",
    "it may be applied to other complex systems , if successful in the spin - glass investigations .",
    "the difficulty is caused by serious slow dynamics .",
    "it requires many monte carlo steps to reach the equilibrium states .",
    "an observed quantity at each step has a strong correlation even after the equilibration",
    ". the system sizes which can be treated in the simulations are accordingly limited to very small ones , e.g. , mostly a linear size is twenty or less in three dimensions .",
    "size effects are generally stronger in the continuous spin systems because the spins are soft and the boundary effect propagates faster .",
    "frustration and randomness also yield a considerable size effect .",
    "the system sizes treated previously in the studies of the heisenberg sg models are too small to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is our motivation for reexamining the sg transition using the nonequilibrium relaxation ( ner ) method@xcite .",
    "the difficulty mentioned above can be overcome by using the ner method .",
    "this method takes an opposite approach to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "schematically shows a comparison between the conventional equilibrium simulational method and the ner method . in the conventional method one takes the infinite time limit first by achieving the equilibrium states in finite sizes",
    "the thermodynamic limit is taken by the finite - size scaling analysis of the obtained data . in the ner method",
    "we take the infinite size limit first by dealing with a very large system within a finite time range before the finite - size effect appears .",
    "then , the _ finite - time scaling analysis _",
    "@xcite is performed to obtain the thermodynamic properties .",
    "the cost of a simulation is in the same order of @xmath2 for both methods .",
    "however , a coefficient factor in the ner method is much smaller than that in the conventional method .",
    "an observation time length in the ner method is sufficient if we can observe a beginning of a final relaxation to the equilibrium states ( equilibrium relaxation ) . on the other hand , it is necessary to wait until the end of the equilibrium relaxation in the conventional method .",
    "the latter time scale is typically @xmath3 times longer than the former one in the spin glass models .",
    "( for example , @xmath4 of @xmath5 in ( a ) or @xmath4 at @xmath6 in ( a ) . )",
    "therefore , the ner method has an advantage over the conventional method by this factor .",
    "we use the residual computational time to enlarge the system size and to increase statistical accuracy .    by using the ner method",
    "we have made it clear that the sg transition occurs in the heisenberg model at the same finite temperature as the cg transition occurs @xcite .",
    "the estimated critical exponent @xmath7 is consistent with the corresponding experimental result @xcite .",
    "the chirality mechanism is not necessary to explain the spin - glass experiments since the chirality trivially freezes if the spin freezes .",
    "however , one may question the use and the validity of the ner method in the spin - glass phenomenon .",
    "therefore , we have corroborated our method by studying the ising sg model .",
    "many numerical investigations @xcite yield consistent results on the existence of the sg transition , the critical temperature and the critical exponents .",
    "they are also consistent with the corresponding experimental results @xcite .",
    "the ner method yields consistent results for a small number of simulations as discussed in .    in this procedure we have found a possibility of a weak universality :",
    "a critical exponent divided by @xmath8 , for example @xmath9 , is common among models in a weak universality class .",
    "a ratio of the critical exponents @xmath10 appearing in a finite - time scaling analysis is found to be consistent between the heisenberg model and the ising model .",
    "we have verified that a ratio @xmath9 is also consistent by evaluating the dynamic exponent @xmath11 alone .",
    "the analysis is expanded to the xy sg model and the value is also found to be consistent .",
    "these findings are quite surprising .",
    "we must reconsider the role of the spin dimensions and the distribution of the randomness in the sg phase transition .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in the model and the method are explained .",
    "descriptions of the procedure of the ner method and the finite - time scaling are given .",
    "in the results on the ising model , the heisenberg model and the xy model are shown .",
    "then , the possibility of a weak universality is discussed .",
    "is devoted to a summary .",
    "a model treated in this paper is the nearest - neighbour @xmath0 random - bond model , @xmath12 a linear size of a lattice is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "skewed periodic boundary conditions are imposed , i.e. , total numbers of spins @xmath14 .",
    "an interaction @xmath15 takes two values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the same probability .",
    "the temperature @xmath18 is scaled by @xmath19 .",
    "spins are updated by a single - spin - flip algorithm .",
    "the metropolis ( m ) update is used in all models , whereas the heat - bath ( h ) update @xcite is used in the heisenberg model .",
    "physical quantities observed in our simulations are the sg susceptibility @xmath4 , the cg susceptibility @xmath20 and the binder parameter in regard to the spin - glass transition @xmath21 .",
    "these quantities are calculated through the overlap between real replicas .",
    "first , we rewrite the thermal average by an arithmetic mean over thermally equilibrium ensembles labelled by @xmath22 as @xmath23 the bracket @xmath24 denotes the thermal average and @xmath25 denotes a number of ensembles .",
    "the index @xmath26 stands for three components of spins : @xmath27 and @xmath11 .",
    "this expression is substituted into the definition of the sg susceptibility : @xmath28_\\mathrm{c } = n \\left [ \\frac{1}{m^2}\\sum_{\\alpha , \\beta}^{m}\\sum_{\\mu,\\nu } ^{x , y , z } ( q^{\\alpha\\beta}_{\\mu,\\nu})^2 \\right   ] _ \\mathrm{c},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is an overlap between the @xmath26 component of a spin @xmath30 on an ensemble @xmath22 : @xmath31 and the @xmath8 component of the spin on an ensemble @xmath32 : @xmath33 .",
    "the bracket @xmath34_{\\rm c}$ ] denotes the configurational average .    here , we introduce the following real replicas",
    ". each real replica takes the same random bond configuration and the different paramagnetic initial spin state .",
    "they are updated in parallel with different random number sequences .",
    "this procedure corresponds to quenching from an infinite temperature .",
    "the thermal ensembles are realized by these real replicas which approach different equilibrium states .",
    "therefore , we replace the thermal average by the average over these real replicas as equation . the indices @xmath22 and @xmath32 now represent real replicas",
    ". we do not take into consideration a constant term which arises from the overlap between the same replica @xmath35 and use the following expressions in the simulations .",

    "it is better to take a large value .",
    "we prepare eight or nine replicas for each bond configuration in this paper .",
    "the scalar chirality is defined by three neighbouring spins as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes a unit lattice vector along the @xmath39 axis . in the xy model",
    "we calculate the vector chirality , which is defined by @xmath40 indices @xmath41 denote four sites forming a square plaquette in the @xmath39 direction from the @xmath30 site .",
    "constants in a definition of @xmath21 are : @xmath42 for the ising model , @xmath43 for the xy model and @xmath44 for the heisenberg model",
    ".        shows a schematic diagram of the simulation procedure .",
    "we calculate a physical quantity at each time step @xmath45 and obtain a relaxation function .",
    "another simulation starts by changing a random bond configuration , initial spin states and a random number sequence .",
    "then , another relaxation function is obtained .",
    "finally , we take an average of data at each step over these different monte carlo runs .",
    "it should be noted that the average is over independent data .",
    "it guarantees an absence of systematic error due to correlations of the observed quantity , which we usually encounter in the conventional monte carlo time average .",
    "the obtained raw relaxation function is utilised by the following finite - time scaling analysis .",
    "the most important point in the ner method is to exclude the finite - size effect from the raw relaxation function .",
    "the method is based upon taking the infinite - size limit first .",
    "if a relaxation function includes a finite - size effect , it exhibits converging behaviour because every finite system has a definite equilibrium state .",
    "this behaviour misleads us into thinking that the temperature is in the paramagnetic phase even though it is the critical temperature .",
    "therefore , the critical temperature is always underestimated if the size is insufficient .",
    "we check the size effect by changing the lattice sizes and always confirm a time range in which the size can be considered as infinity .",
    "the sg susceptibility is expected to diverge at the critical temperature ( @xmath46 ) as @xmath47@xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath46 , @xmath7 and @xmath48 by the finite - time scaling analysis on the relaxation functions of @xmath49 in the paramagnetic phase.@xcite since the initial spin configuration is completely random , @xmath50 .",
    "we start a set of simulations at a temperature @xmath18 that is obviously in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the relaxation function @xmath49 at this temperature increases with @xmath45 but soon converges to a finite value .",
    "as the temperature is lowered to approach the critical temperature , the relaxation function tends to show diverging behaviour .",
    "since the temperature is still in the paramagnetic phase , the relaxation finally converges to a finite value after a correlation time @xmath51 .",
    "the spin - glass correlation increases with time and reaches the correlation length @xmath52 after this correlation time .",
    "two quantities relate with each other by @xmath11 as @xmath53 . therefore",
    ", the correlation time should diverge at @xmath46 as @xmath54 the correlation time can be estimated by scaling the raw relaxation function .",
    "we obtain @xmath10 and @xmath51 so that the scaled functions @xmath55 at all temperatures plotted against @xmath56 fall onto a single curve .",
    "then , the critical temperature and the exponent @xmath48 are estimated by the least - squares fitting with the equation . since a ratio @xmath10",
    "is already estimated by the scaling , @xmath7 is obtained .",
    "the ner of the binder parameter @xmath57 is calculated at the obtained @xmath46 .",
    "since quantity is related to the fourth - order cumulant , many bond samples are necessary to obtain meaningful data .",
    "the number of bond configurations to obtain the results in this paper is summarised in .",
    "the binder parameter is expected to diverge at @xmath46 as @xmath58@xcite , by which @xmath11 is independently obtained .",
    "then , @xmath8 is estimated from a value of @xmath48 obtained by the @xmath59-fitting explained above .",
    "all exponents are now estimated by the scaling relation .",
    "it is possible to compare the critical exponents with the experimental results .",
    "the last procedure of our method is to corroborate the results by observing the ner of @xmath4 at the obtained @xmath46 .",
    "it should diverge as @xmath60 with the same exponent obtained by finite - time scaling .",
    "if the exponents are inconsistent , the scaling analysis is misled by an insufficient time range or by the finite - size effect . in the ising model",
    "we perform another check at @xmath46 by observing the ner of the distribution function of the replica overlap , @xmath61 .",
    "the finite - time scaling plot of @xmath61 should ride on a single scaling function with the same exponent obtained by finite - time scaling of @xmath4 .",
    "this is a direct interpretation of the finite - size scaling of @xmath62 @xcite by @xmath63 .",
    "numbers of bond configurations to obtain data at the critical temperature are summarised in .",
    "the numbers at other temperatures are mostly in the same order . for each bond configuration , we prepared eight replicas for the xy and the heisenberg model and nine replicas for the ising model .",
    ".numbers of bond configurations to obtain data of @xmath4 and @xmath21 at @xmath46 in this paper . indices ( m ) and ( h ) in the heisenberg model denote update algorithms : ( m ) for the metropolis and ( h ) for the heat - bath .",
