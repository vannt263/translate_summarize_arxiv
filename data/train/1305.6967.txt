    "remote triggering of large earthquakes , where one large earthquake causes another large earthquake at a global distance comparable to the size of the earth , is the subject of ongoing debate in geophysics .",
    "it is well known that earthquakes do cause aftershocks on local scales , at distances comparable to the size of the fault . in the last 20 years",
    ", it has been shown that seismic waves can dynamically trigger earthquakes at large distances @xcite , and more recently , that a large earthquake can trigger other large earthquakes at global distances @xcite .",
    "however , other recent studies suggest that dynamic triggering of large earthquakes is not widespread @xcite . thus , dynamic triggering of large events at global distances remains an open question , one with potentially significant implications for hazard analysis and earthquake physics .",
    "remote triggering necessarily implies that large earthquakes are correlated in time , that is , earthquakes are not equivalent to a random process .",
    "the increase in earthquake activity over the past decade including three of the six largest events on record over the past century @xcite raises the question whether great earthquake are clustered ( fig .",
    "[ fig - sequence ] ) .",
    "recent studies have utilized a variety of statistical methods to examine whether the sequence of large earthquakes is consistent with a random process .",
    "the approaches used to analyze the earthquake record include for example , statistics of the number of events in a fixed time interval , and statistics of the time between events .",
    "however , the small number of powerful events constitutes a serious challenge for such investigations @xcite . to date , some studies reported deviations from random event statistics @xcite , while several others report that the earthquake record is consistent with random statistics @xcite .    .",
    "three thresholds are used : @xmath1 ( bottom ) , @xmath2 ( middle ) , and @xmath3 ( top).,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    in this study , we focus on the recurrence time between successive earthquake events , a quantity that allows us to probe the most powerful events on record .",
    "our statistical analysis quantifies typical properties as well as extremal properties of the recurrence time . using numerical simulations",
    ", we generate a large number of random sequences , thereby allowing probabilistic comparison between the earthquake record and a random process .",
    "we analyze the earthquake event times in the usgs pager ( prompt assessment of global earthquake response ) catalog @xcite , supplemented by the global cmt ( centroid moment tensor ) catalog @xcite .",
    "these two catalogs comprise a global record from 1900 through december 31 , 2012 , containing 1770 events with magnitude @xmath4 ( table i ) .",
    ".the number of large events on record during the years @xmath5 . listed",
    "are the total number of events ( with and without aftershocks ) versus the minimum magnitude @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the catalog contains aftershocks , which must be identified to address whether earthquake occurrence is random over global distances .",
    "removal of aftershocks is not a trivial procedure , as it requires assumptions that can not be tested due to limited data @xcite .",
    "we identify aftershocks using a window method @xcite : any event close enough to another larger event in both space and time is considered an aftershock , and is removed from the catalog .",
    "we examine a variety of choices for the distance and time windows and verify that our conclusions are robust with respect to the aftershock removal procedure . in the following ,",
    "we use the time window in the original gardner and knopoff study , and our choice for the distance window is a purposely conservative estimate of the rupture length for a given magnitude ( i.e. overestimated spatial extent of aftershocks ) , based on an empirical law @xcite .",
    "we note that our analysis classifies two of the @xmath6 events as aftershocks : the @xmath7 2005 nias earthquake , and the @xmath8 2007 sumatra earthquake , both aftershocks of the 2004 @xmath9 sumatra - andaman earthquake . without aftershocks",
    ", the catalog contains 1255 events ( table 1 ) . for completeness",
    ", we include in our investigation both the raw earthquake catalog as well as the catalog with aftershocks removed .",
    "the basic quantity in our analysis is the recurrence time , defined as the time between two successive events .",
    "recurrence times are commonly used to characterize seismic activity . for a random process ,",
    "where events occur at a constant rate and there are no correlations between different events , the cumulative distribution @xmath10 of recurrence intervals that are larger than @xmath11 is purely exponential , @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the average recurrence time .    for reference",
    ", the distribution with the average @xmath14 calculated from the empirical data is also shown in figure [ fig - pt ] .",
    "the empirical distribution is in good agreement with the exponential distribution for magnitude thresholds @xmath15 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . in two cases ( @xmath16 and @xmath2 ) the tail of the distribution becomes closer to an exponential once aftershocks are removed .",
    "this preliminary analysis indicates that the sequence of large earthquake events does not show significant deviations from random event statistics .        as the magnitude threshold increases ,",
    "the number of events becomes smaller and the distribution of recurrence times can be probed only over a smaller range .",
    "consequently , the tail of the distribution , which quantifies the likelihood of large gaps between events , becomes difficult to measure . to address this issue and to systematically probe high magnitudes , we analyze a standard measure for fluctuations , the normalized variance @xmath17 here the bracket denotes an average over all recurrence intervals in the sequence .",
    "the variance involves the lowest ( nontrivial ) integer moment of the distribution , yet , as discussed below , we also analyze a range of other moments .",
    "we use numerical simulations to characterize how the normalized variance behaves for a random process .",
    "we generate a very large number ( @xmath18 ) of random sequences where the recurrence times are identical and independently distributed variables , drawn from the exponential distribution .",
    "the number of events @xmath19 and the average recurrence time @xmath13 are set by the earthquake record , for each magnitude threshold @xmath0 . by simulating the precise number of events @xmath19 on record",
    ", our analysis properly quantifies the large fluctuations that are expected when the number of events is small .",
    "we measure the average variance , @xmath20 , and the standard deviation in the variance , @xmath21 , defined by @xmath22 ( here , the bracket denotes an average over all random sequences ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig - var]a , the normalized variance is close to unity when the number of events is large , but when the number of events is small ( at large magnitudes ) , the expected variance decreases , and the standard deviation becomes comparable to the mean .",
    "we also confirm that as expected , @xmath23 for large @xmath19 .     and the standard deviation of the variance @xmath21 as a function of magnitude threshold @xmath0 .",
    "these quantities correspond to a random sequence with a number of events that matches that of the earthquake record ( aftershocks removed ) .",
    "( b ) normalized variance @xmath24 as a function of @xmath0 . shown are the behaviors with and without aftershocks .",
    "( c ) the number of standard deviations away from the mean @xmath25 defined in eq .",
    ", versus @xmath0.,scaledwidth=42.5% ]    the normalized variance defined in eq .",
    "is shown as a function of the threshold magnitude in fig .",
    "[ fig - var]b . using the average @xmath20 and the standard deviation @xmath21 obtained from simulated sequences , we also calculate @xmath25 the number of standard deviations away from the mean ( fig .",
    "[ fig - var]c ) , @xmath26 for most magnitude thresholds , even without removing aftershocks , the quantity @xmath25 is not large , evidence that the earthquake sequence is consistent with a random process .",
    "there are however three significant peaks that indicate potential deviations from random event statistics .",
    "first , at the magnitude thresholds , the raw earthquake catalog deviates from a random process , but once aftershocks are removed , these deviations are largely eliminated .",
    "second , there is a peak at @xmath27 , but again , this peak is eliminated once aftershocks are removed .",
    "third , the most pronounced peak occurs when @xmath28 . in this case , however , removing aftershocks diminishes the magnitude of the peak only slightly ( for such powerful earthquakes , aftershocks are of course rare , see table 1 ) .     of random sequences with variance exceeding the empirical value versus magnitude threshold @xmath29 .",
    "shown are results for the raw catalog ( circles ) and the catalog with aftershocks removed ( squares ) .",
    "the error bars were produced using the moment analysis described in the main text.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to quantify the significance of the peaks in the quantity @xmath25 , we use probabilistic analysis .",
    "such analysis requires numerical simulations because the distribution of the variance depends strongly on the number of events : this distribution approaches a normal distribution as the number of events becomes very large , but it is much broader when the number of events is small .",
    "specifically , we measure the fraction @xmath30 of simulated random sequences where the normalized variance exceeds the empirical value @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig - fv ] shows the fraction @xmath30 as a function of magnitude threshold @xmath0 . for each peak in @xmath25",
    ", there is a corresponding dip in the fraction @xmath30 .",
    "these dips are mostly suppressed once aftershocks are removed .",
    "yet , the dip at the narrow band @xmath28 is robust . at @xmath3",
    "we find @xmath31 , that is , only one in about @xmath32 random sequences has a variance that exceeds that of the earthquake data .",
    "this small fraction implies that the earthquake record deviates from a random process at this particular magnitude threshold . as pointed out by shearer and stark @xcite ,",
    "because @xmath33 is chosen a posteriori , the measured fraction @xmath30 may represent an underestimate .",
    "regardless , the fraction @xmath30 is not sufficiently small to conclude with confidence that the earthquake record violates random statistics or equivalently , that there are temporal correlations ( or causal relationships ) between large events .    as a reference ,",
    "our simulations show if @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or @xmath36 additional @xmath37 events occur over the next decade @xcite , the quantity @xmath30 would then drop to @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the change in the quantity @xmath30 with even a few additional events illustrates the uncertainties associated with such small catalogs .    for further insight",
    ", we examine statistical properties of the maximal recurrence time @xmath41 , corresponding to the longest quiescent period between consecutive earthquakes .",
    "similar to the probabilistic analysis above , we measure the fraction @xmath42 of random sequences where the maximal recurrence time exceeds @xmath43 .",
    "when the number of events is large , this fraction is given by the formula .",
    "[ fig - fmax]a shows the fraction @xmath42 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "statistics of the largest recurrence time are strongly correlated with those of the variance : the fraction @xmath42 mirrors the behavior of the fraction @xmath30 ( figures [ fig - fv ] and [ fig - fmax]a ) . moreover , if we restrict our attention to magnitudes @xmath44 where aftershocks are rare , the two fractions are remarkably close to each other ( figure [ fig - fmax]b ) .",
    "indeed , we verify that simulated random sequences with a maximal gap that exceeds @xmath41 also have variance that exceeds @xmath24 .",
    "this extreme event analysis demonstrates that the very large @xmath45 year gap separating two clusters of activity , one during 1950 - 1965 and one during 2004 - 2012 is responsible for the anomalously large variability observed at the magnitude threshold @xmath3 ( figure [ fig - sequence ] ) .     of random sequences where the maximal recurrence time exceeds the largest recurrence time on record versus magnitude threshold @xmath0 .",
    "( b ) the fraction @xmath30 ( see also figure [ fig - fv ] ) and the fraction @xmath42 for the earthquake catalog without aftershocks.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    previous statistical analysis based on the number of events in a given time interval revealed deviations from random event statistics at this magnitude range that can be traced to magnitude uncertainties in the earlier part of the century @xcite .",
    "to assess the effects of uncertainties in the earthquake magnitude @xcite , we introduce unbiased variations in the magnitude : where @xmath46 represents a potential measurement error .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is drawn from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "we systematically increase the range @xmath48 up to as high as @xmath49 , and repeat the analysis used to obtain figures [ fig - var]-[fig - fmax ] .",
    "each data point is obtained using @xmath18 simulated catalogs : @xmath50 distinct modifications of the original earthquakes catalog were generated , and for each modification , @xmath50 simulated catalogs were produced .",
    "the fractions @xmath30 and @xmath42 become smoother as the range @xmath48 increases ( figure [ fig - blur ] ) , and moreover , the dips at @xmath6 are strongly suppressed .",
    "we also consider situations where the magnitude is always underestimated or overestimated by uniformly drawing @xmath46 in the range @xmath51 $ ] or @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "biased errors lead to the same patterns shown in figure [ fig - blur ] .",
    "we also verify that variations @xmath46 drawn from a normal distribution with standard deviation @xmath53 lead to similar results .",
    "consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite , magnitude uncertainty analysis supports the conclusions of our statistical analysis .     as in figure [ fig - fv ] and",
    "( b ) the quantity @xmath42 as in figure [ fig - fmax ] versus @xmath0 .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 quantifies the range of magnitude uncertainty , and the different curves represent different values of @xmath53 in the plots.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to examine whether the results are sensitive to the particular measure of variability , we repeat the analysis using the normalized moments @xmath54 instead of the variance @xmath55 . we examine a series of moments in the range @xmath56 and again , measure the fraction @xmath57 of simulated catalogs where the moment @xmath58 exceeds the value measured for the earthquake data . by varying the parameter @xmath59 and identifying the maximal and minimal fractions @xmath57",
    ", we produce the error bars shown in figure [ fig - fv ] .",
    "the results of this moment analysis confirm that the dips in the quantity @xmath30 are robust .",
    "in summary , we analyzed typical and extremal properties of the time intervals between large earthquakes .",
    "the results of our statistical tests reconcile recent studies that address the question : `` are great earthquakes clustered ? ''",
    "our study yields three important conclusions .",
    "first , in the magnitude threshold range @xmath60 which constitutes the vast majority of great earthquakes on record , the earthquake sequence does not exhibit significant deviations from a random set of events .",
    "these findings reinforce the results of several studies @xcite . at several threshold magnitudes ,",
    "the earthquake record is consistent with a random process even if aftershocks are not removed from the catalog .",
    "second , the roughly twenty most powerful events on record , corresponding to magnitude threshold , deviate from a random sequence of events .",
    "this departure is tied to the anomalously long gap between two clusters of events , one in the mid - century , and one over the past decade , an observation also noted in @xcite .",
    "however , this departure is not sufficiently strong to conclude that there are temporal correlations between great earthquakes : the likelihood that a random sequence matches the variability in the data ( @xmath61 ) is equivalent to only @xmath62 standard deviations from the mean for a normal distribution .",
    "third , the results are qualitatively and quantitatively robust .",
    "analysis of average properties and analysis of extremal properties of the recurrence time leads not only to similar conclusions , but also , to very similar likelihood figures that the observed sequence of events can be explained by a random process .",
    "we have also considered magnitude uncertainties using unbiased and biased measurement errors in earthquake magnitude and observed that such errors systematically suppress deviations from random event statistics .",
    "finally , our study uses the average recurrence time as a measure for the overall rate of events .",
    "uncertainties in the overall rate of events are significant when the number of events is small , and an important challenge for future research is to generalize the analysis above to incorporate uncertainties in the overall rate of events .",
