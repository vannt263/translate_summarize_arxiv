    "the problem of finding variable configurations that minimize the energy of a system with competitive interactions has been and still is a central one in the study of complex systems , like spin glasses in physics , protein folding and regulatory networks in biology , and optimization problems in computer science ( see _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) .    among the tools for numerical investigations of complex systems at low temperatures",
    "the simulated annealing ( sa ) algorithm @xcite and its variants have played a major role .",
    "such stochastic processes satisfy detailed balance and their behavior can be compared with static and dynamical mean - field calculations .",
    "however , in problems in which the interest is focused on zero temperature ground states and where the proliferation of metastable states causes an exponential slowdown in the equilibration rate , the applicability of sa - like algorithms is limited to relatively small system sizes .",
    "in computer science the field of combinatorial optimization @xcite deals precisely with the general issue of classifying the computational difficulty ( `` hardness '' ) of minimization problems and of designing search algorithms . similarly to statistical physics models , a generic combinatorial optimization problem is composed of many discrete variables_e.g . , _",
    "boolean variables , finite sets of colors or ising spins  which interact through constraints typically involving a small number of variables , that in turn sum up to give the global cost - energy function .    when the problem instances are extracted at random from nontrivial ensembles ( that is ensembles which contains many instances that are hard to solve ) , computer science meets physics in a very direct way : many of the models considered to be of basic interest for computer science are nothing but spin glasses defined over finite connectivity random graphs , the well studied diluted spin glasses @xcite .",
    "their associated energy function counts the number of violated constraints in the original combinatorial problem ( with ground states corresponding to optimal solutions ) . understanding the onset of hardness of such systems is at the same time central to computer science and to @xmath0 statistical physics with surprisingly concrete engineering applications .",
    "for instance , among the most effective error correcting codes and data compression methods are the low density parity check algorithms @xcite , which indeed implement an energy minimization of a spin glass energy defined over a sparse random graph . in such problems , the choice of the graph ensemble is a part of the designing techniques , a fact that makes spin glass theory directly applicable .",
    "the above example is however far from representing the general scenario for combinatorial problems : in many situations the probabilistic set up is not defined and , consequently , the notion of typical - case analysis does not play any obvious role .",
    "the study of the connection ( if any ) between worst - case and typical - case complexity is indeed an open one and very few general results are known @xcite .",
    "still , a precise understanding of non - trivial random problem instances promises to be important under many aspects .",
    "new algorithmic results as well as many mathematical issues have been put forward by the statistical physics studies , with examples ranging from phase transitions @xcite and out - of - equilibrium analysis of randomized algorithms @xcite to new classes of message - passing algorithms @xcite .",
    "the physical scenario for the diluted spin glasses version of hard combinatorial problems predicts a trapping in metastable states for exponentially long times of local search dynamic process satisfying detailed balance . depending on the models and on the details of the process_e.g . , _ cooling rate for sa ",
    "the long time dynamics is dominated by different types of metastable states at different temperatures @xcite .",
    "a common feature is that at zero temperature and for simulation times which are sub - exponential in the size of the problem there exists an extensive gap in energy which separates the blocking states from true ground states .",
    "such behavior can be tested on concrete random instances which therefore constitute a computational benchmark for more general algorithms .",
    "of particular interest for computer science are randomized search processes which do not properly satisfy detailed balance and that are known ( numerically ) to be more efficient than sa - like algorithms in the search for ground states @xcite .",
    "whether the physical blocking scenario applies also to these artificial processes , which are not necessarily characterized by a proper boltzmann distribution at long times , is a difficult open problem .",
    "the available numerical results and some approximate analytical calculations @xcite seem to support the existence of a thermodynamical gap , a fact which is of up - most importance for optimization .",
    "for this reason ( and independently from physics ) , during the last decade the problem of finding minimal energy configurations of random combinatorial problems similar to diluted spin - glasses_e.g . , _ random k - satisfiability ( k - sat ) or graph coloring  has become a very popular algorithmic benchmark in computer science @xcite .    in the last few years",
    "there has been a great progress in the study of spin glasses over random graphs which has shed new light on mean - field theory and has produced new algorithmic tools for the study of low energy states in large single problem instances .",
    "quite surprisingly , problems which were considered to be algorithmically hard for local search algorithms , like for instance random k - sat close to a phase boundary , turned out to be efficiently solved by the survey propagation ( sp ) algorithm arising from the replica symmetry broken ( rsb ) cavity approach to diluted spin glasses .",
    "such type of results calls for a rigorous theory of the functioning of sp ( which is a non local process ) and bring new mathematical challenges of potential practical impact .",
    "scope of this paper is to display a set of new numerical and algorithmic results which complete previously published results on the sp algorithm .",
    "we shall deal only with the random k - sat problem even though we expect the algorithmic outcomes to be applicable to other similar problems like , for instance , the random graph coloring .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections",
    "[ ksat ] , [ sp ] we briefly review the known results on random k - sat together with the sp equations over single instances at finite pseudo - temperature .",
    "we discuss as well in [ sp - y ] how the sp algorithm can be modified in order to study the region of parameters with finite ground state energy ( unsat phase ) , where not all constraints of the underlying random k - sat problem can be satisfied simultaneously . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we discuss then the performance of sp as an optimization device . at variance with the sat phase in which many clusters of zero energy configurations coexist and where sp works efficiently without need of correcting variable assignments , in the unsat phase an efficient implementation of sp",
    "requires the introduction of  at least  a very simple form of backtracking procedure ( similar to the one proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "we show that a linear time backtrack is enough to reach energies compatible with those predicted by the analytic calculations in the infinite size limit in the relevant region of parameters .",
    "we give moreover numerical evidence for the existence of threshold states for one of the most efficient randomized local search algorithms for solving random k - sat , namely walksat @xcite .",
    "we display a blocking mechanism at an energy level which is definitely above the lower bound for the dynamical threshold states predicted by the stability analysis of the 1-rsb cavity equations .",
    "finally , for the deep unsat phase , we report on numerical data on convergence times for both walksat and sa which are in agreement with the predicted existence of full rsb ( f - rsb ) phases .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "k - sat is a np - complete problem @xcite ( for @xmath1 ) which lies at the root of combinatorial optimization .",
    "it is very easy to state : given @xmath2 boolean variables and @xmath3 constraints taking the form of clauses , _ k - sat consists in asking whether it exists an assignment of the variables that satisfies all constraints_. each clause contains exactly @xmath4 variables , either directed or negated , and its truth value is given by the or function . since the same variable may appear directed or negated in different clauses , competitive interactions among clauses may set in .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in the last decade there has been a lot of interest on the random version of k - sat : for each clause the variables are chosen uniformly at random ( with no repetitions ) and negated with probability @xmath5 .    in the large @xmath2 limit",
    ", random k - sat displays a very interesting threshold phenomenon . taking as control",
    "parameter the ratio of number of clauses to number of variables , @xmath6 , there exists a phase transition at a finite value @xmath7 of this ratio . for @xmath8",
    "the generic problem is satisfiable ( sat ) , for @xmath9 the generic problem is not satisfiable ( unsat ) .",
    "this phase transition has been seen numerically @xcite and it is of special interest since extensive experiments @xcite have shown that the instances which are algorithmically hard to solve are exactly those where @xmath10 is close to @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the study of the sat / unsat phase transition is considered of crucial relevance for understanding the onset of computational complexity in typical instances @xcite .",
    "a lot of work has been focused on the study of both the decision problem ( _ i.e. , _ determining with a yes / no answer whether a satisfying assignment exists ) , and the optimization version in which one is interested in minimizing the number of violated clauses when the problem is unsat ( random max - k - sat problem ) .    on the analytical side , there exists a proof that the threshold phenomenon exists at large @xmath2 @xcite , although the fact that the corresponding @xmath11 has a limit when @xmath12 has not yet been established rigorously .",
    "upper bounds @xmath13 on @xmath11 have been found using first moment methods @xcite and variational interpolation methods @xcite , and lower bounds @xmath14 have been found using either explicit analysis of some algorithms @xcite , or some second moment methods @xcite . for random max - k - sat theoretical bounds",
    "are also known @xcite , as well as rigorous results on the running times of random walk and approximation algorithms @xcite .",
    "recently , the cavity method of statistical physics has been applied to k - sat @xcite and the thresholds have been computed with high accuracy .",
    "a lot of work is going on in order to provide a rigorous foundation to the cavity results and we refer to @xcite for a more complete discussion of these aspects .    in what follows",
    "we shall concentrate on the @xmath15 case and we will be interested in analyzing the behavior of different algorithms in the region of parameter in which the random formulas are expected to be hard to solve or to minimize .",
    "the energy function which is used in the zero temperature statistical mechanics studies is taken proportional to the number of violated clauses in a given problem so that a zero energy ground state corresponds to a satisfying assignment .",
    "the energy of a single clause is positive ( equals 2 for technical reasons ) if the clause is violated and zero if it is satisfied .",
    "the overall energy is obtained by summing over clauses and reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the @xmath18-th binary ( spin ) variable appearing in clause @xmath19 and the coupling @xmath20 takes the value 1 ( resp .",
    "-1 ) if the corresponding variable appears not negated ( resp .",
    "negated ) in clause @xmath19 .",
    "for instance the clause @xmath21 has an energy @xmath22 where the boolean variables @xmath23 are connected to the spin variables by the transformation @xmath24 .",
    "the phase diagram of the random 3-sat problem as arising from the statistical physics studies can be very briefly summarized as follows .    for @xmath25 ,",
    "the @xmath0 phase is at zero energy ( the problem is sat ) .",
    "the entropy density is finite and the phase is replica symmetric ( rs ) and unfrozen . roughly speaking",
    ", this means that there exists one giant cluster of nearby solutions and that the effective fields vanish linearly with the temperature .    for @xmath26",
    ", there is a full rsb phase .",
    "the solution space breaks in clusters and the order parameter becomes a nested probability measure in the space of probability distribution describing cluster to cluster fluctuations .",
    "the phase is still sat and unfrozen @xcite .    at @xmath27",
    "there is a discontinuous transition toward a clustered frozen phase @xcite .",
    "up to @xmath28 the phase is f - rsb while above the 1-rsb solution becomes stable@xcite .",
    "the _ complexity _ , that is the normalized logarithm of the number of clusters , is finite in this region . at finite energy there",
    "exist even more metastable states which act as dynamical traps .",
    "the 1-rsb metastable states become unstable at some energy density @xmath29 which constitutes a lower bound to the true dynamical _ threshold energy _ ( see sec .",
    "[ sp ] for more details ) .    at @xmath30",
    "the ground state energy becomes positive and therefore the typical random 3-sat problem becomes unsat . at the same point the complexity vanishes .",
    "the phase remains 1-rsb up to @xmath31 where an instability toward a zero complexity full rsb phase appears .    in the region @xmath32 ,",
    "the 1-rsb ansatz for the ground state is stable against higher orders of rsb , but the 1-rsb predictions become unstable for energies larger than the _ gardner energy_. the instability line intersects with the 1-rsb ground state extimation at the two extremes of the interval , inside which it provides a lower bound to the true threshold energy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive discussion ) .    further ( preliminary ) f - rsb corrections suggest that the true threshold states have energies very close to the lower bound and hence the interval @xmath33 $ ] should be taken as the region where to take really hard benchmarks for algorithm testing .        as displayed in fig .",
    "[ small_gap_fig ] , the actual value of the energy gap is very small close to the end points of @xmath34 . in order to avoid systematic finite size errors ,",
    "numerical simulations should be done close to the sat / unsat point , _ i.e. , _ far from the end point of @xmath34 . consistently with the fact that finite size fluctuations are relatively big ( @xmath35 , even close to @xmath11 problem sizes of the order at least of @xmath36 are necessary in order to observe a matching with the analytic predictions .",
    "the 1-rsb cavity equations which have been used to study the typical phase diagram of random k - sat become the sp equations once reformulated to run over single problem instance @xcite .",
    "this is done by avoiding the averaging process with respect to the underlying random graphs .",
    "thanks to the self - averaging property of the random k - sat free energy @xcite , the sp equations can be used both to re - derive the phase diagram of the problem and , more important , to access detailed information of algorithmic relevance about a given problem instance . in particular , the sp equations provide information about the statistical behavior of the single variables in the stable and metastable states of given energy density .",
    "the 1-rsb cavity equations are iterative equations ( averaged over the disorder ) for the probability distribution functions ( pdf ) of effective fields that describe their cluster - to - cluster fluctuations .",
    "the order parameter is a probability measure in the space of pdf s ; it tells the probability that a randomly chosen variable has a certain associated pdf in states at a given energy density .    in sp and more in general in the cavity approach",
    ", one assumes to know pdf s of the fields of all variables in the temporary absence of one of them",
    ". then one writes the induced pdf of the local field acting on this `` cavity '' variable in absence of some other variable interacting with it ( _ i.e. , _ the so called bethe lattice approximation for the problem ) .",
    "these relations define a closed set of equations for the pdf s that can be solved iteratively .",
    "the equations are exact if the cavity variables acting as inputs are uncorrelated , _ e.g. , _ over trees , or are conjectured to be an asymptotically exact approximation over locally tree - like structures @xcite where the typical distance between randomly chosen variables diverges in the large @xmath2 limit ( as @xmath37 for diluted random graphs ) . the full list of the cavity fields over the entire underlying graph , in the sp implementation , constitutes the order parameter . from the cavity fields",
    "one may determine the total field acting on each variable in all metastable states of given energy density and this information can be used for algorithmic purposes .",
    "a clear formalism for the single sample analysis is given by the factor graph representation @xcite of k - sat : variables are represented by @xmath2 circular `` variable nodes '' labeled with letters @xmath38 whereas the k - body interactions are represented by @xmath3 square `` function nodes '' ( carrying the clause energies ) labeled by @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "[ factorgraph ] )        for random 3-sat , function nodes have connectivity @xmath40 , variable nodes have a poisson connectivity of average @xmath41 and the overall graph is bipartite .",
    "the total energy is nothing but the sum of energies of all function nodes as given by eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) .    adopting the message - passing notation and strictly following @xcite ,",
    "we call @xmath42-messages the contribution to the cavity fields coming from the different connected branches of the graph . in sp",
    "the messages along the links of the factor graph have a functional nature carrying information about distributions of @xmath42-messages over the states at a given value of the energy , fixed by a lagrange multiplier @xmath43 : we call these distributions of messages @xmath42-surveys .",
    "the sp equations can be written at any `` temperature '' ( the inverse of the lagrange multiplier @xmath43 is actually a pseudo - temperature , see @xcite ) .",
    "however they acquire a particularly simple form in the limit @xmath44 , which is the limit of interest for optimization purposes , at least in the sat region .    in k - sat",
    ", the @xmath42-surveys are parameterized by two real numbers and sp can be implemented very efficiently .",

    "in the sat phase , where the @xmath85 limit is taken , the convolutions ( [ p ] ) filter out completely any clause - violating truth value assignment . this feature is extremely useful for satisfiable formulas , but it becomes undesired when our sample is presumably unsatisfiable .    in the unsat region",
    "the sp equations require a finite value of the lagrange multiplier @xmath43 . the filtering action of the exponential re - weighting term in ( [ p ] )",

    "let us compute for instance the @xmath42-survey @xmath111 ( see always fig .",
    "[ popdynfig ] for the notation ) . in order to do that ,",

    "the procedure of decimation continues until when a full truth assignment has been generated or until when convergence has been lost or a paramagnetic state has been reached ; in the latter cases the original formula is simplified according to the partial truth assignment already generated and the simplified formula is passed to a specialized heuristic .",
    "our choice of preference is the walksat algorithm @xcite , which is by far more efficient than sa in the hard region of the 3-sat problem , as we have checked exhaustively .",
    "very briefly , the strategy of walksat is the following one : at each time step the current assignment is changed by randomly alternating greedy moves ( where the variable which maximizes the number of satisfied clauses if fixed ) and random - walk steps ( in which a variable belonging to a randomly chosen unsatisfied clause is selected and flipped ) .",
    "walksat stops if either a satisfying assignment is found or if the maximum number of allowed spin flips ( the `` cutoff '' ) is reached ( see ref .",

    "when working at finite pseudo - temperature , we have to take in account the possibility that some non optimal fixing is done in presence of thermal `` noise '' .",
    "after several updates of the @xmath42-surveys some biases of fixed spins may become smaller than the value they had at the time when the corresponding spin was fixed .",
    "certain local fields can even revert their orientation .",

    "the actual sp with finite @xmath43 simplification procedure ( sp - y ) will depend not only on the backtracking fraction @xmath132 , but even more on the choice of the inverse pseudo - temperature @xmath43 .",
    "the simplest possibility is to keep it fixed during the simplification , but one may choose to dynamically update it , in order to stay as close as possible to the maximum @xmath133 of the free energy functional @xmath75 ( which corresponds to select the ground state in the 1-rsb framework , as we have seen in section  [ sp ] ) .",

    "as we have already discussed in section  [ sp ] , it is expected that , in the thermodynamical limit , any local search algorithm gets trapped in the vicinity of exponentially numerous threshold states with energy @xmath82 and that any local heuristics is in general unable to find the optimal assignment in the thermodynamical limit . to verify this prediction",
    ", we conducted various experiments , both in the sat and in the unsat phase , focusing on the comparison between the walksat heuristics performance after and before different kinds of sp - y simplification . in most of the situations",
    ", we decided to analyze carefully single large - sized samples instead of a larger number of smaller problems : we verified in fact that the sample - to - sample fluctuations tend to be unrelevant for size of order @xmath135 and larger .",
    "the aim of the first set of experiments was to check the actual existence of the threshold effect .",
    "we ran walksat over different formulas in the hard - sat region , with fixed @xmath136 and sizes varying between @xmath137 and @xmath36 , reaching a maximum cutoff of @xmath138 spin flips .",
    "the obtained results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ; the gardner energy is also reported for comparison with the data . even if for small - size samples the local search algorithm is able to find a sat assignment , for larger formulas ( @xmath139 ) walksat does not succeed in reaching the ground state , its relaxation profile suffers of critical slowdown , and saturates at some",
    "well defined level .",
    "this is actually expected , because the gardner energy becomes @xmath140 only for @xmath141 or larger , and for a smaller number of variables the threshold effect should be negligible when compared to finite size effects .",
    "we remind that walksat can not be considered as an equilibrium stochastic process and that it is not possible to infer that its saturation level coincides with the sample threshold energy ; we can anyway claim that walksat is unable to explore the full energy landscape of the problem , and that the enormous number of non optimal valleys is unavoidably hiding the true ground states .",
    "plateaus in the relaxation profiles of walksat have indeed been already discussed in @xcite and ascribed to metastable states acting as dynamical traps",
    ".    for the @xmath142 formula a trapping effect becomes clearly visible in our experiments , but the saturation plateau is below the gardner lower bound .",
    "the finite - size fluctuations are still of the same order of the energy gap between the ground and the threshold states and the experimental conditions are distant from the thermodynamical limit . when the size is increased up to @xmath143 variables , the saturation level moves finally between the full rsb lower bound and the 1-rsb upper bound for @xmath82 .",
    "the efficiency of the sp - y simplification strategy against the glass threshold is discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] .",
    "we simplified a single randomly generated formula ( @xmath36 , @xmath144 ) at several fixed values of pseudo - temperature .",
    "the solid line shows for comparison the walksat results after a standard sp decimation ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath76 ) : the ground state , @xmath145 , is reached as expected , after a rather small number of spin flips .",
    "the same happens after sp - y simplifications performed at a large enough inverse pseudo - temperature ( @xmath146 ) ; one should remind indeed that in the sat region the optimal value for @xmath43 would be infinite , and that in that limit the sp - y recursions reduce to the sp equations .",
    "after simplification with smaller @xmath43 s , the walksat cooling curves reach again a saturation level , which is nevertheless below the gardner energy , unless @xmath43 is too small : the threshold states of the original formula have not been able to trap the local search , even if the ground state becomes inaccessible .",
    "as we have indeed already discussed , working at finite temperature increases the probability of violating a clause when doing a spin fixing , and this is particularly evident in the sat region where every assignment that does not satisfy some constraint should be filtered out .",
    "the procedure is intrinsically error prone , and it will allow in general to reach only `` good states '' , but not the true optimal solutions ( the smaller the parameter @xmath43 , the higher the saturation level will be ) . as we shall discuss in the next section , the use of backtracking partially cures the accumulation of errors at finite y : the saturation level can in fact be significantly lowered by keeping the same pseudo - temperature and introducing a small fraction of backtrack moves during the simplification . in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] the data for @xmath147 shows the importance of backtracking .",
    "while the run of sp - y without backtracking has led to a plateau above gardner energy , with the introduction of backtrack moves we find energies well below the threshold .",
    "when entering the unsat region , the task of looking for the optimal state becomes harder .",
    "the expected presence of violated constraints in the optimal assignments really forces us to run the simplification at a finite pseudo - temperature .",
    "unfortunately , after many spin fixings , the recursions ( [ pdrecinit ] ) , ( [ pdrec ] ) stop to converge for some finite value of @xmath43 before the maximum of the free energy is reached , most likely because the sub - problem has entered a full rsb phase . at this point one should switch to a 2-rsb version of sp which we did not realize , yet .",
    "alternatively , one could try to run directly the final heuristic search ( hoping that the full rsb sub - system is not exponentially hard to optimize ) or more simply one may continue the decimation process by selecting the largest @xmath43 for which the computation converge .",
    "we decided to implement the latter choice until either convergence is lost independently from the value of @xmath43 or a paramagnetic state is reached .    in our experiments we studied several 3-sat sample problems belonging to the 1-rsb stable unsat phase .",
    "we employed walksat as an example of standard well - performing heuristics .",
    "although walksat is not optimized for unsatisfiable problems , in the 1-rsb stable unsat region it performs still much better than any basic implementation of sa .",
    "we observed anyway that , even after @xmath138 spin flips , the walksat best assignments were still quite distant from the gardner energy , for various samples of different size and @xmath10 . in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] we show the results relative to many different sp - y simplifications with various values of @xmath43 and @xmath132 for a single sample with @xmath36 and @xmath148 .",
    "the simplification produced always an improvement in the walksat performance , but , in absence of backtracking , we were unable to go below the gardner lower bound ( although we touched it in some cases : in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] we show the data for a simplification at fixed @xmath149 ; a simplification with runtime optimization of @xmath43 reached the same level ) .    the relative inefficiency of these first attempts of simplification was not due to the threshold effect alone , but also to an extreme sensitivity to the choice of @xmath43 , as pointed out by a second set of experiments making use of backtracking .",
    "we performed first an extensive analysis of the simultaneous optimization of @xmath43 and @xmath132 , using smaller samples in order to produce more experimental points .",
    "after some trials , the fraction @xmath150 appeared to be the optimal one , at least for our implementation , and in the small region under investigation of the k - sat phase diagram .",
    "the data in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] refers to a formula with @xmath142 variables and @xmath151 .",
    "the dashed horizontal line shows the walksat best energy obtained on the original formula after @xmath152 spin flips .",
    "the walksat performance was seriously degraded when simplifying at too small values of @xmath43 , but the introduction of backtracking cured the problem , identifying and repairing most of the wrong assignments .",
    "the walksat efficiency became actually almost independent from the choice of pseudo - temperature , whereas in absence of error correction a time consuming parameter tuning was required for optimization .",
    "coming back to the analysis of the sample of fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , the backtracking simplifications allowed us to access states definitely below the gardner lower bound .",
    "the combination of runtime @xmath43-optimization and of error correction was even more effective : after a rather small number of spin flips , walksat reached a saturation level strikingly closer to the ground state lower bound than to the gardner energy . a further valuable effect of introduction of the backtracking was the increased efficiency of the formula simplification itself : in the backtracking experiments , sp - y was able to determine a truth value for more than 80% of the variables before losing convergence , while without backtracking , the algorithm stopped on average after only 40% of fixings .",
    "all the samples analyzed in the previous sections were taken from the 1-rsb stable region of the 3-sat problem , where the equations ( [ p ] ) , ( [ q2 ] ) are considered to be exact . for @xmath153 ,",
    "the phase becomes full  rsb and sp loses convergence before the free energy @xmath75 reaches its maximum from the very first step of the decimation procedure .",
    "while a full  rsb version of sp would most likely provide very good results , sp - y still can be used in a sub - optimal way by selecting the largest value of @xmath43 for which convergence is reached . numerical experiment show that indeed the performance of sp - y are in good agreement with the analytical expectations .",
    "however , it should be noticed that in this region the use of sp is not necessary .",
    "although the performance of walksat and sa can be improved by the sp simplification , the sa alone is already able of finding close - to - optimum assignments efficiently ( as expected for a full  rsb scenario ) and behaves definitely better than walksat .",
    "in this paper , we have displayed the performance of sp as an optimization device and shown that configurations well below the threshold states can be found efficiently .",
    "similar results are expected to hold also for random satisfiable instances very close to the critical point for which the combined use of finite pseudo - temperature and backtracking could give access to the sat optima .",
    "it would be of some interest to analyze further improvements of the decimation strategies as well as to consider more structured factor graphs within a variational framework , in which some correlations can be put under control .    a possible application of sp - y  like algorithms can be found in information theory : lossy data compression based on low density parity check schemes leads to optimization problems which are indeed very similar to the one discussed in this paper .",
