    "stoichiometrically stable complexes are formed by proteins that _ physically _ interact to achieve biological functions within the cell .",
    "these complexes interact with individual proteins or other complexes to form functional modules and pathways that drive the cellular machinery .",
    "therefore , a faithful reconstruction of the entire set of complexes is essential to not only understand complex formations , but also the higher level organization of the cell .",
    "recent advances in high - throughput techniques have enabled to catalogue enormous amounts of physical interaction data particularly in organisms such as _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ ( budding yeast ) . typically these interactions are arranged in the form of a protein interaction network ( or ppi network ) and mined for complexes using computational techniques . from a topological perspective",
    ", these complexes are typically interpreted as regions in the network where proteins are densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , several computational methods have been proposed that depend primarily on the _ topologies _ of ppi networks , and model _ dense _ regions as complexes ; for a survey , see  .",
    "for example , mcl  @xcite simulates a series of random walks ( called a _ flow _ ) , the principle being that when the walks reach a dense region , with high probability , they will continue to remain in that region . by repeated iterations of inflation ( thickness ) and expansion ( spread ) of the flow , mcl identifies complexes .",
    "mcode  @xcite , on the other hand , identifies  seed \" proteins in the network using clustering coefficients and greedily expands in the neighborhood of these seeds to build complexes .",
    "cmc  @xcite first generates maximal cliques from the network , and then merges highly interconnected cliques to assemble complexes .",
    "haco  @xcite performs agglomerative clustering by generating small clusters and hierarchically merging them into complexes .",
    "haco improves upon the traditional hierarchical agglomerative clustering ( hac ) by allowing for overlaps among the generated complexes .",
    "finally , mcl - caw  @xcite produces initial clusters using mcl and then refines these clusters by incorporating core - attachment structure to generate complexes .",
    "we performed comprehensive evaluations  @xcite of these methods , particularly mcl , mcl - caw , cmc and haco , on a variety of yeast ppi networks ranging from raw to highly - filtered and under varying levels of natural as well as artificial noise , and found that these methods failed to detect many known complexes catalogued in the mips  @xcite database .",
    "for example , mcl missed 65 out of the 123 mips complexes present in the consolidated@xmath5 network from @xcite .",
    "even the  union \" of these methods missed 52 out of the 123 complexes .",
    "since the goal here is to study genome - wide compositions of complexes ( the  complexosome \" ) , failure to detect even the known subset of complexes reflects severe limitations in current methods .      in order to understand the characteristics of these missed complexes , we  superimposed \" yeast complexes taken from the mips benchmark  @xcite onto the high - confidence consolidated@xmath5 yeast ppi network  @xcite ( # proteins : 1622 , # interactions : 9704 , average node degree : 11.187 ) .",
    "this  superimposition \" involves identifying the proteins of the benchmark complex in the ppi network , and extracting out the subnetwork induced by those proteins .",
    "figure 1 in supplementary materials shows this  superimposition \" visualized using _ cytoscape",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the immediate observation , which is of course typical to most ppi networks , was that the network comprised of one main large component and multiple _ disjoint _ smaller components of sizes 2 to 50 . out of the 123 mips complexes containing at least four proteins in the network ,",
    "89 were completely embedded in the main component , and the remaining 34 were  scattered \" among more than one components .",
    "when we ran mcl on this network , it was able to recover only 58 of these 123 complexes .",
    "of the 65 undetected complexes , 27 complexes were the ones that were  scattered \" , and 34 complexes , though intact , had very low interaction densities ( @xmath6 ) in the network .",
    "in fact , some of these complexes lacked internal connectivities to an extent that it was impossible for _ any _ algorithm to assemble back these disconnected pieces into whole complexes solely based on topological information .",
    "for example , the mips complex 510.190.110 ( ccr4 complex ) had seven proteins in the network scattered among four disjoint components .",
    "( shown within ellipses in figure 1 in supplementary materials ) .",
    "this complex remained disconnected with a low density of 0.1905 , and naturally went undetected by all the four algorithms ( a few more examples are available from supplementary materials ) .",
    "further , most mips complexes being small ( sizes @xmath7 10 - 15 ) , lacking in just a few proteins or interactions easily rendered many complexes disconnected or with low interaction densities , resulting in them going undetected .",
    "all these findings revealed that a potentially strong correlation existed between the  network constitution \" of a complex ( the number of member proteins in the network and their connectivities ) and the possibility of it being detected using existing algorithms .",
    "this work is strongly motivated by the limitations in existing complex detection methods in successfully detecting complexes , and the aforesaid revelations on the topologies of these undetected complexes within ppi networks .",
    "the purpose of our work therefore is two - fold : ( i ) to _ characterize _ these undetected complexes , that is , to quantitatively measure their  network constitution \" ; and ( ii ) to propose a novel algorithm employing functional interactions to enhance the  derivability \" of sparse complexes , which in turn empowers existing methods in detecting these complexes satisfactorily .",
    "we represent our ppi network as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the set of proteins and @xmath10 is the set of interactions between the proteins .",
    "each interaction @xmath11 is assigned a weight @xmath12 that reflects the confidence of the interaction , which is usually determined using an affinity weighting scheme ( the weight it is set to 1 if no scheme is used ) . for any @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 refers to the set of neighbors of @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the set of benchmark complexes .",
    "we propose the term _ sparse complexes _ for the undetected complexes and  very broadly \" define them as follows :    [ sp1 ] sparse complexes : given a ppi network @xmath17 and a set of benchmark complexes @xmath18 known to be embedded in @xmath17 , the subset @xmath19 of complexes that can not be satisfactorily detected from @xmath17 by existing methods are called sparse complexes .",
    "we next propose _ indices _ that measure the  derivability \" of a benchmark complex from a given ppi network .",
    "these indices capture whether or not a benchmark complex is derivable from a given ppi network , and if so , to what extent .",
    "we propose two kinds of indices here .",
    "the first kind defines definitive criteria to categorize a given benchmark complex as derivable or not from the ppi network , and provides _ derivability bounds _ on the number of such complexes in the network .",
    "the second kind does not strictly categorize the benchmark complex as derivable or not , but instead assigns a _",
    "derivability score _ to the complex .      to begin with , a naive yet natural way to categorize a benchmark complex as _ derivable _ from a ppi network",
    "is if it satisfies two criteria : ( i ) it has sufficient number of proteins in the network ; and ( ii ) it is connected within the network .",
    "we consider a benchmark complex @xmath20 to be _",
    "@xmath21-protein - derivable _ from @xmath17 if at least @xmath22 of its member proteins are present in @xmath17 .",

    "based on these two factors we next define indices that assign _ derivability scores _ to each benchmark complex to reflect the confidence or extent to which the complex is derivable from the network . _",

    "these  hardest \" complexes to detect can form  holes \" in the network by having zero interactions among their member proteins but having interactions with their immediate neighbors ( see supplementary materials for a visual representation of these complex sets ) .",

    ", we propose to use _ functional interactions _ for this purpose , specifically aimed at improving complex prediction .",
    "functional interactions or associations are logical interactions among proteins that share similar functions  @xcite .",
    "these interactions can be inferred among proteins participating in the same multi - protein assemblies ( complexes , functional modules and pathways ) , or annotated to similar biological functions and processes , or encoded by genes maintained and regulated together or genes having the same ` phylogenetic profile ' ( present or absent together across several genomes ) , etc .",
    "therefore , these interactions  encode \" information beyond just direct physical interactions .",
    "in fact many of the computational methods developed to predict protein interactions mainly manage to predict functional interactions .",
    "functional interactions can be considered more  general \" or a  superset \" of direct physical interactions : two proteins involved in a stable physical interaction are functionally related , but two proteins involved in a functional interaction may not necessarily interact physically .",
    "this means functional interactions have a potential to effectively _ complement _ physical interactions .",
    "we capitalize on this complementarity by non - randomly adding functional interactions to ensure the two required criteria : ( i ) some functional interactions may be direct physical interactions missing in the physical datasets - these are directly useful to  pull - in \" disconnected proteins ; and ( ii ) even if some functional interactions do not correspond to direct physical interactions , if they fall within the same complex , they can  artificially \" increase the density of that complex .      here , we propose a post - processing based algorithm sparc to empower existing methods in detecting sparse complexes by using functional interactions .",

    "_ step 3 ( iterative ) : _ for each reserved cluster @xmath73 , the @xmath43-score is recalculated with respect to @xmath74 .",
    "if for the cluster @xmath73 , the @xmath43-score improves beyond @xmath67 , that is , @xmath75 , it is output as a predicted complex .",
    "if not , we explore in the neighborhood of @xmath73 to include proteins that can potentially improve @xmath76 .",
    "we consider the set of direct neighbors @xmath77 , and sort them in non - increasing order of their interaction weights to @xmath73 .",
    "we then repeatedly consider a protein @xmath78 in that order such that @xmath79 and add it to @xmath73 , till the @xmath43-score can not be improved any further .",
    "if the improved @xmath43-score manages to cross @xmath67 , we output the cluster @xmath73 as a predicted complex .",
    "the key idea behind sparc is as follows .",
    "many complexes have low @xmath43-scores in the ppi network . if adding functional interactions can either increase their internal connectivities or ",
    "pull in \" the disconnected proteins , we can increase the @xmath43-scores of these complexes .",
    "however , blindly adding functional interactions can result in many false positive predictions .",
    "therefore , here we selectively utilize functional interactions only to improve the @xmath43-scores of clusters predicted out of the physical network . those clusters that show",
    "the improvement correspond to real complexes .",
    "we gathered physical interactions from _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ ( budding yeast ) inferred from the following yeast two - hybrid and affinity purification experiments , deposited in biogrid  @xcite : uetz ( 2000 ) , ito ( 2001 ) , gavin ( 2002 , 2006 ) , krogan ( 2006 ) , collins ( 2007 ) and yu ( 2008 ) , to build the protein interaction network , which we call the _ physical network _ @xmath80 .",

    "but , for higher values of @xmath53 , the three scored networks showed considerably higher @xmath43-derivable complexes than both the @xmath80 and @xmath83 networks .",
    "these findings indicate that noise had a sizable impact on the @xmath43-scores of complexes : the improvement obtained by adding functional interactions was completely canceled out by noise , leading to lower performance of the @xmath83 network .",

    "but , using filtered ( scored ) functional interactions helped to reconstruct significantly more complexes out of the physical clusters .    one interesting point to note",
    "is that the compositions of predicted complexes vary based on the scoring scheme used ( also noted in  @xcite ) , and therefore we had to construct a _ consensus set _ of complexes from the three scoring schemes for each of the methods . to do this , we employed a three - way agreement scheme based on jaccard overlaps .",
    "let @xmath117 be a complex triplet , each complex predicted from a different scored network by the same method .",
    "if at least two complex pairs from @xmath118 achieve significant jaccard overlaps @xmath119 , then the proteins of @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are merged together into a single consensus complex @xmath123 . only the proteins originating from at least two complexes",

    "for example , the rna polymerase complexes i , ii and iii , that are involved in the formation of rna chains during transcription  @xcite , were bundled into a large dense module together with some of the tbp - associated factors and tfiid complexes , which are also involved in transcription  @xcite . due to the functional similarity between the subunits of all these complexes , several functional interactions were added among them . consequently , the methods recovered a large dense module housing all these complexes from which the individual complexes could not be segregated .",

    "though this assumption might be valid , relying too much on it in the wake of insufficient ppi data makes it ineffective to detect sparse complexes . to counter this ,",
    "we employ functional interactions , which again has not been tried before",
