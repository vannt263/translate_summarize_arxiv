    "the interest of the last decade in dynamical and rheological properties of complex fluids has seen the introduction of several new numerical methods for carrying out computer simulations on hydrodynamic time scales , the simulation of which using molecular dynamics often results in intensive computational demands .",
    "these new techniques include : ( i ) lattice gas cellular automata ( lgca ) ; ( ii ) lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) and ( iii ) dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) .",
    "the last method was introduced by hoogerbrugge and koelman , and was modified by espaol and warren to ensure a proper thermal equilibrium state .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is a theoretical analysis and explicit calculation of transport and thermodynamic properties in terms of model parameters .",
    "this is highly relevant in view of the current interest in applications of dpd to systems such as flows past complex objects , concentrated colloidal suspensions , dilute polymer solutions and phase separation .",
    "the dpd algorithm models a fluid of @xmath0 interacting particles out of equilibrium and conserves mass and momentum . position and velocity variables are _ continuous _ , as in molecular dynamics ( md ) , but time is updated in _",
    "steps @xmath2 , as in lgca and lbe .",
    "the algorithm is a mixture of molecular dynamics , brownian and stokesian dynamics and lgca s , with a _ collision _ and a _ propagation _ step . in the collision",
    "step each particle interacts with all the particles inside an action sphere of radius @xmath3 through _ conservative _ forces @xmath4 , _ dissipative _ forces @xmath5 , which are proportional to both the stepsize @xmath2 and a friction constant @xmath6 , and _ random _",
    "forces @xmath7 , which supply the energy lost by the damping . here",
    "@xmath8 label the particles . in numerical simulations",
    ", this is implemented by simultaneously updating the velocities from their precollision value @xmath9 to their postcollision value @xmath10 according to the instantaneous forces exerted by all particles inside the action sphere . in the subsequent _ propagation _",
    "step of fixed length @xmath2 all particles move freely to their new positions @xmath11 .",
    "usual forms of the conservative force mean that the particles may be considered as completely interpenetrable .",
    "these softer interactions have the computational advantage of allowing particle motion on the order of a mean free path @xmath12 during each time step of fixed length @xmath2 .",
    "this represents a substantial advantage over event driven md algorithms for hard sphere fluids , where the length @xmath2 of the free propagation interval is on average much shorter , especially at fluid densities .    by ignoring some of the microscopic details of the interactions , which are presumably irrelevant for fluid dynamics",
    ", dpd has the advantages of lgcas , but avoids the disadvantages of lacking galilean invariance and of introducing spurious conservation laws .",
    "in fact , the `` point particles '' should not be considered as molecules in a fluid , but rather as clusters of particles that interact dissipatively .",
    "the introduction of noise and dissipation represents a coarse - grained mesoscopic level of description and hydrodynamic behaviour is expected at much smaller particle numbers than in conventional md . if @xmath13 denotes the characteristic kinetic timescale in dpd , with @xmath14 the number density , @xmath15 the number of dimensions and @xmath6 the friction constant , then @xmath16 is considered to be large compared to any molecular time scale .",
    "in this coarse - grained description the dominant interactions are the dissipative and random forces , whereas the conservative forces can be interpreted as weak forces of relatively long range and may be taken into account as a vlasov mean field term in the kinetic equations .",
    "in addition , they can have the spurious effect of tending to force the dpd particles into `` colloidal crystal '' configurations , unless friction and noise are sufficiently large to prevent cooling into a lattice configuration . in the second half of the paper , where we derive a kinetic equation for the single particle distribution function",
    ", the conservative force will be neglected .",
    "this corresponds to the strong damping limit ( @xmath6 large ) .",
    "the random forces act effectively as repulsive forces to prevent collapse of dpd particles .    a substantial contribution towards the understanding of the dpd fluid was given by espaol and warren , who derived a fokker - planck equation for the @xmath0-particle distribution function in the limit of continuous time ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these authors also modified the original algorithm by imposing the detailed balance conditions , which guarantee the existence of the proper thermal gibbs equilibrium , described by @xmath18 $ ] where @xmath1 is the hamiltonian of the corresponding conservative system and @xmath19 is the global equilibrium temperature .",
    "these results are briefly reviewed in section [ section2 ] to establish the notation .",
    "concerning the macroscopic evolution equations , espaol formally established the linearized navier - stokes equations and derived green - kubo formulae for the dpd transport coefficients using a mori - zwanzig projection operator technique .",
    "however , to date no quantitative evaluation of these formulae for dpd seems to exist .",
    "hence , little is known explicitly about the approach to equilibrium , the validity of standard hydrodynamics ( system size dependence , effects of generalised hydrodynamics ) or about transport coefficients . for the transport coefficients , hoogerbrugge and koelman",
    "have estimated the kinematic viscosity @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the shear viscosity and @xmath22 is the mass density , as @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "this result has recently been extended in to include the bulk viscosity by applying the `` continuum approximation '' to the discrete equations of motion for the dpd particles , following suggestions of hoogerbrugge and koelman . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we show how the free energy of the dpd fluid _ monotonically _ approaches its equilibrium value by proving an @xmath1-theorem for the fokker - planck equation of espaol and warren , and we make the connection with the detailed balance conditions derived in .    as a first step towards establishing the full nonlinear hydrodynamic equations we derive in section [ section4 ] the full macroscopic conservation laws for mass and momentum density , as well as the energy balance equation (",
    "details are given in appendix a ) .",
    "the conceptual basis for the existence of hydrodynamic equations is the _ local equilibrium _ state , which in dpd is very different from that in a molecular fluid , because of the unusual role of the temperature . in section [ section5 ]",
    "we study in a quantitative fashion the decay of the energy density @xmath25 and `` kinetic '' temperature @xmath26 towards thermal equilibrium with global temperature @xmath27 , and we assess in what sense and on what timescale the dpd fluid describes an _ isothermal _ fluid out of equilibrium .",
    "this is done on the basis of a nonlinear kinetic equation -referred to as fokker - planck - boltzmann ( fpb ) equation- for the single particle distribution function @xmath28",
    ". it will be obtained from the first equation of the bbgky hierarchy for the dpd fluid in combination with the molecular chaos assumption .    by solving in section [ section6 ] the fpb equation in the hydrodynamic stage , using the chapman - enskog method",
    ", we derive the constitutive relations and the navier - stokes equation .",
    "this enables us to calculate in section [ section7 ] the transport coefficients of shear and bulk viscosity , as well as the self - diffusion coefficient .",
    "so far , we have not discussed the _ discrete time version _ of dpd , as implemented in actual simulations .",
    "they show a sensitive dependence of thermodynamic and transport properties on time step @xmath2 . a promising step towards understanding the @xmath2-dependence",
    "was recently taken by marsh and yeomans , who calculated the equilibrium temperature as a function of the step size , determined stability criteria for the step size , and validated their result by extensive numerical simulations .",
    "we shall not attempt to present here a systematic study of the different @xmath29-corrections to equilibrium distributions and transport properties , but postpone this to a later publication .",
    "the paper ends in section [ section8 ] with comments on the most important results and future prospects for dpd .",
    "the dynamics of a dpd system defines the time evolution of an @xmath0-particle system , specified by a point @xmath30 in phase space , in terms of stochastic differential equations . for a theoretical description",
    "it is more convenient to consider the equivalent fokker - planck equation , derived by espaol and warren .    to interpret the separate terms in the fokker - planck equation , it is instructive first to consider the analogous _",
    "kramers equation _ for the probability @xmath31 of a single particle of mass @xmath32 , having a phase description @xmath33 at time @xmath34 :    @xmath35    the three terms on the right can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the first term is an external conservative force @xmath36 .",
    "the term involving the damping constant @xmath6 corresponds to the langevin force @xmath37 and the diffusive term with diffusion coefficient @xmath38 results from the random force @xmath39 in the equivalent langevin description , which reads :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is gaussian white noise with amplitude @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a @xmath15-dimensional unit tensor .",
    "if we impose that the stationary solution of the kramers equation be the gibbs distribution : @xmath46 , then the diffusion coefficient must satisfy the following _ detailed balance _ ( db ) condition :    @xmath47    where @xmath19 is the temperature in thermal equilibrium , measured in energy units .",
    "the full fokker - planck equation derived by espaol and warren for the dpd system is a direct extension of the kramers equation to @xmath0 interacting particles .",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath0-particle distribution function @xmath48 is governed by :    @xmath49    where the conservative , dissipative and random parts of the evolution operator are defined respectively as :    @xmath50    the summations run over all particles and the only difference to the original is that the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath42 have been scaled by the mass @xmath32 such that @xmath6 has the dimensions of an inverse time .",
    "the three terms above are the @xmath0-particle extensions of the three terms on the rhs of ( [ eqn : kramers ] ) .",
    "* the conservative part @xmath51 results from the additive and central interparticle interactions due to a potential , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the relative position and a hat denotes a unit vector .",
    "it is the liouville operator for the corresponding conservative system and in the limit of zero noise and friction , equation ( [ eqn : operators ] ) reduces to the liouville equation . *",
    "the second term is analogous to the dissipative term in the kramers equation .",
    "it accounts for the langevin damping force between the pair @xmath54 , which is proportional to the friction constant @xmath6 and to the component of the relvative velocity @xmath55 along the line of centres @xmath56 , and is of finite range .",
    "this last property is described by a positive weighting function @xmath57 that is only non - vanishing inside an action sphere of finite radius @xmath3 . * the last term in ( [ eqn : operators ] )",
    "represents the random noise and should be compared with the diffusive term in ( [ eqn : kramers ] ) .",
    "the random force @xmath58 between the pair @xmath54 is directed along @xmath56 and is proportional to @xmath59 where the weighting function @xmath60 is again only non - vanishing within a finite action sphere .",
    "the ranges of the conservative , dissipative and random forces may all be different as the model stands .",
    "moreover , one of the essential properties of dpd is that its dynamics conserves total particle number , @xmath0 , and the total momentum , @xmath61 .",
    "consequently @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constants of the motion .",
    "the latter is always set equal to 0 as the total system is assumed to be at rest . here @xmath64 is the single particle distribution function .",
    "in addition , we want to emphasize that microscopic momentum conservation is an essential property of a fluid model if it is to have a momentum density @xmath65 that is slowly varying in space and time .",
    "in contrast , we note that the energy of the system is not strictly conserved under the dpd algorithm .",
    "the equations for the mass , momentum and energy density will be discussed more fully in section [ section4 ] . in typical applications",
    "the conservative force may be set equal to zero .",
    "the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath42 satisfy the equation ( [ eqn : db ] ) and the weighting functions are chosen such that @xmath66 , which constitute in combination with ( [ eqn : db ] ) the detailed balance conditions for the dpd system , as will be discussed in section [ section3 ] . the density is typically chosen such that there are 5 to 10 particles within an action sphere , which means that the instantaneous total force on any particle is small on average .",
    "figure 1 shows an enlargement of part of configuration space , showing a sequence of 20 consecutive particle positions evolving from a randomly chosen initial configuration .",
    "the trajectories are relatively smooth , in contrast to the discontinuous paths in hard core interactions , illustrating that the resultant force on each particle is relatively small at this parameter setting .",
    "consider the following functional of the @xmath0-particle distribution function @xmath48 :    @xmath67 = \\int d{\\bf \\gamma } p({\\bf \\gamma},t ) \\left\\ { h+\\theta_0 \\ln p({\\bf \\gamma},t ) \\right\\},\\ ] ]    where @xmath68 and @xmath1 is the hamiltonian of the corresponding conservative system :    @xmath69    @xmath70 is the potential energy and @xmath71 is the pair interaction . the functional can be interpreted as a sort of _ free energy _",
    "@xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the average total energy and @xmath74 yields the total entropy .",
    "the goal of this section is to show that @xmath75 is a lyapunov functional with @xmath76 and to investigate the implications of this result for the equilibrium solution of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "the time derivative of ( [ eqn : functional ] ) yields in combination with ( [ eqn : fp ] ) :    @xmath77    we observe that the third term inside @xmath78 in ( [ eqn : f_evol ] ) vanishes due to total probability conservation .",
    "then consider the contribution @xmath79 to ( [ eqn : f_evol ] ) due to the liouville operator @xmath51 .",
    "partial integration with respect to @xmath80 and @xmath81 yields directly @xmath82 here @xmath83 because the curly brackets represent poisson brackets , as can easily be demonstrated . the second term in ( [ eqn : f_evol_c ] )",
    "reduces to surface terms in @xmath80 and @xmath81 and therefore vanishes too .",
    "next , we combine the remaining terms in ( [ eqn : f_evol ] ) and perform a partial @xmath81 integration , also symmetrizing the result over @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the final result is :    @xmath86    now we make the following observation . if we choose :    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is an arbitrary positive function vanishing for @xmath89 , then @xmath76 , as the rhs of ( [ eqn : f_evol_full ] ) can be cast into the form :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the same as in ( [ eqn : f_evol_full ] ) .",
    "note that the equality sign applies if and only if @xmath92 is the solution of ( [ eqn : eqm_constraint ] ) below .",
    "consequently , the free energy - type function @xmath93 $ ] is a monotonically decreasing function of time , until it reaches equilibrium where @xmath94 which is simply the solution of @xmath91=0 for every pair @xmath54 :    @xmath95    changing variables to the relative velocities of the particles , it is easy to prove that the equilibrium distribution of the system is separable in the velocities , and has the general form :    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is a constant independent of @xmath80 and @xmath34 .",
    "we will only consider macroscopic systems which are not in uniform motion at long times and consequently limit ourselves to @xmath98 .",
    "the function @xmath99 is also the stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation ( [ eqn : fp ] ) if @xmath100 satisfies @xmath101 .",
    "this yields the gibbs distribution as the equilibrium solution :    @xmath102    where @xmath1 is the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) of the system and @xmath103 is a normalisation constant .",
    "we assume that @xmath104 is uniquely determined by the requirements that it satisfies ( [ eqn : eqm_constraint ] ) and ( [ eqn : fp ] ) .",
    "consequently the dpd system will always reach the same equilibrium state if left undriven , independent of the volume and number of particles .",
    "the temperature of this equilibrium state has a value @xmath105 , which _ only _ depends on the parameters of the model .",
    "so dpd describes a system , thermostated at @xmath27 and with a free energy @xmath106 $ ] at equilibrium .",
    "note that , in contrast to the @xmath1-theorem for the boltzmann equation ( see e.g. ) , no molecular chaos approximation is required to derive this result for the dpd system .    in their original discussion ,",
    "espaol and warren imposed that the gibbs distribution be the stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "the consequences of this requirement can be seen by inserting ( [ eqn : gibbs ] ) into ( [ eqn : fp ] ) .",
    "it leads to the so - called _ detailed balance _",
    "constraint    @xmath107    consequently , the constraint imposed in ( [ eqn : weights ] ) is the detailed balance constraint for dpd .",
    "the important result from the @xmath1-theorem is that it demonstrates that the gibbs distribution ( [ eqn : gibbs ] ) is the _",
    "inevitable _ equilibrium distribution . throughout the rest of the paper",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to dealing exclusively with dpd systems that obey the db condition ( [ eqn : db_constraint ] ) .",
    "if the db condition is violated , no @xmath1-theorem can be derived and the gibbs distribution is not a stationary solution of the fp equation for dpd . in this case , the stationary state of the system does not correspond to thermal equilibrium but to some driven state , which will in general exhibit long range spatial correlations ( see e.g. ) .",
    "the original version of dpd , introduced by hoogerbrugge and koelman violates the db requirement ( [ eqn : db_constraint ] ) and therefore its stationary distribution will not approach a gibbs state but may exhibit spatial correlations , e.g. algebraic correlations @xmath108 where @xmath15 is the number of dimensions , extending far beyond the ranges of the conservative , dissipative and stochastic forces .",
    "this absence of thermal equilibrium is likely to be the reason for difficulties and inconsistencies discussed in .",
    "in the previous section we have established the existence of and approach to a thermal equilibrium state for the dpd system that obeys the detailed balance condition ( [ eqn : db_constraint ] ) . in this section , we address the problem of how the quantities of macroscopic interest evolve in time towards the final equilibrium state , concentrating on the local mass density @xmath109 , the local momentum density @xmath65 and the local energy density @xmath25 .",
    "as discussed in section [ section2 ] the microscopic dynamics of dpd conserve mass and momentum , and the corresponding macroscopic densities obey local conservation laws . as the total energy is not conserved under dpd , the evolution equation for the macroscopic energy density does not have the form of a local conservation equation , but contains source and sink terms corresponding to the random and dissipative forces respectively . in the final equilibrium state , these will balance each other .    consider a general macroscopic quantity @xmath110 , defined through    @xmath111    its time evolution can be obtained from the fokker - planck equation ( [ eqn : fp ] ) combined with the detailed balance condition ( [ eqn : db_constraint ] ) , by multiplying the fokker - planck equation with @xmath112 , integrating over all @xmath113-space and performing one or two partial integrations with respect to @xmath81 and @xmath114 .",
    "the result is the general rate of change equation :    @xmath115    for any dynamic variable @xmath116 .",
    "consider the conserved mass density @xmath109 and the momentum density @xmath65 defined through :    @xmath117    it is convenient at this stage to introduce the single particle and pair distribution functions , defined as :    @xmath118    application of ( [ eqn : grce ] ) to the conserved densities in ( [ eqn : field_defn ] ) yields the macroscopic conservation laws :    @xmath119    where @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the local pressure tensor or momentum flux density in the local rest frame of the fluid .",
    "the continuity equation has been derived by setting @xmath122 into ( [ eqn : grce ] ) .",
    "the only non - vanishing term is the one containing @xmath123 , and the continuity equation follows at once .",
    "derivation of the conservation equation for the momentum density proceeds along similar lines by choosing @xmath124 .",
    "details of the latter derivation are given in the appendix [ appendix1 ] , where it is shown that    @xmath125    with kinetic(k ) , collisional transfer(c ) and dissipative(d ) contributions :    @xmath126    with @xmath127 .",
    "the kinetic flux contains the so - called _ peculiar velocity _ ,",
    "@xmath128 , and @xmath129 is the spatially averaged pair distribution function :    @xmath130    the kinetic and collisional transfer contributions to the momentum flux in ( [ eqn : pt_defn ] ) and ( [ eqn : pt_contribs ] ) are present in any particle model with conservative forces .",
    "they are dominant in systems with sufficiently high density - dense gases and liquids - where the potential energy contributions are non - negligible with respect to the kinetic fluxes .    the explicit form for these collisional transfer contributions is given in the literature for several cases : smooth potentials , elastic hard spheres , or inelastic hard spheres .",
    "the dissipative contribution @xmath131 results from the langevin - type damping forces between the particles .",
    "the random forces do not contribute to the momentum flux .",
    "the @xmath1-theorem , derived in section [ section3 ] , guarantees the approach to thermal equilibrium , where the distribution functions take the form :    @xmath132    where @xmath133 is the pair distribution function in thermal equilibrium , @xmath134 is the number density , and @xmath135 the maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "the sum of the kinetic and collisional transfer contributions reduces to the equilibrium pressure and the dissipative contribution vanishes .",
    "thus , @xmath136 with @xmath137 given by the virial theorem :    @xmath138    where @xmath139    away from global equilibrium , the pressure tensor @xmath140 will contain the local equilibrium pressure and terms involving the viscosities .",
    "however , before the navier - stokes equations , or more generally , the full set of hydrodynamic equations , can be derived the concept of _ local equilibrium _ - which forms the conceptual basis of slow hydrodynamic evolution - has to be re - examined , as the energy is no longer a conserved quantity .",
    "this can only be done after identifying the slow and fast relaxation modes in dpd , on the basis of a kinetic equation .",
    "this will be done in section [ section5 ] .",
    "next we consider the energy density , defined as :    @xmath141    where @xmath142 is the microscopic energy per particle .",
    "use of the rate of change equation ( [ eqn : grce ] ) leads after some lengthy algebra to the energy balance equation , as discussed in appendix [ appendix1 ] .",
    "it reads :    @xmath143    here the explicit form of the source term is :    @xmath144    where the term proportional to @xmath27 is a source resulting from the random force , and the term with the minus sign is a sink resulting from the langevin - type damping forces . in global equilibrium ,",
    "the source and sink terms balance one another and @xmath145 .",
    "the _ heat current _ @xmath146 , given explicitly in equations ( [ microenergy]-[energyflow ] ) of appendix [ appendix1 ] , contains the standard kinetic and collisional transfer contributions due to conservative forces , as well as dissipative contributions analagous to @xmath131 in ( [ eqn : pt_contribs ] ) , and @xmath146 vanishes in global equilibrium .",
    "if @xmath147 would be set equal to zero , equation ( [ eqn : e_flow ] ) would have the generic form of the energy balance equation in ordinary hydrodynamics , where the heat current would contain a term proportional to the temperature gradient . as will become apparent in later sections ,",
    "this is not the case in the dpd system .",
    "although ( [ eqn : e_flow ] ) looks like a macroscopic equation for the energy balance in the presence of sources and sinks , it looses its physical significance after a relaxation time @xmath16 , in which @xmath148 , and ( [ eqn : e_flow ] ) reduces to the continuity equation .",
    "this will be discussed in section [ section6 ] , below equation ( [ eqn : a_defn ] ) .",
    "one may also derive a balance equation for the free energy density , which would be a local version of the @xmath1-theorem of section [ section3 ] or of the corresponding one of section [ section5 ] for the fokker - planck - boltzmann equation .",
    "it would enable one to identify the irreversible entropy production .",
    "a similar balance equation for the entropy density in a dilute gas can be derived from the boltzmann equation .",
    "in this section we derive an approximate kinetic equation , referred to as the fokker - planck - boltzmann ( fpb ) equation , for the single particle distribution function @xmath64 , which is based on the molecular chaos assumption and has a collision term which is quadratic in @xmath64",
    ". moreover , from here on the _ conservative forces _ will be neglected , which corresponds to the strong damping limit ( @xmath6 large ) .",
    "this section is organised as follows .",
    "we start by deriving the first equation of the bbgky hierarchy , which relates @xmath149 to the pair function @xmath150 .",
    "then the _ molecular chaos _ assumption :    @xmath151    yields a closed equation , the fpb equation , which again satisfies an @xmath1-theorem .",
    "next we analyse the _ local equilibrium _",
    "solution of the kinetic equation , which provides the conceptual basis for the existence of hydrodynamic equations and transport coefficients , as well as the justification for solving this kinetic equation for finding the `` normal solution '' by means of the chapman - enskog method .",
    "the first equation of the bbgky hierarchy can be derived directly by applying equation ( [ eqn : grce ] ) to the @xmath152-space density :    @xmath153    its average yields @xmath64 on account of ( [ eqn : f_defn ] ) .",
    "the resulting equation of motion is :    @xmath154    where the @xmath155 contraction of tensors is defined by @xmath156 , with @xmath157 , @xmath158 denoting cartesian components of vectors or tensors .",
    "the equation can be further simplified to :    @xmath159    where @xmath160 . performing the integrals over all variables except @xmath161 and @xmath162",
    "leads to : @xmath163 this is the first equation of the bbgky hierarchy with the fokker - planck equation ( [ eqn : fp ] ) taking the place of the liouville equation as the evolution equation . under the molecular chaos approximation ( [ eqn : molecular_chaos ] ) we have the following closed equation for the one particle distribution function :    @xmath164    the molecular chaos approximation is a mean - field approximation , which neglects dynamical correlations resulting from correlated multiple collisions taking place inside an action sphere . as we have set all conservative forces equal to zero , the molecular chaos assumption is exact in the global equilibrium state .",
    "indeed , simulation results show that this is in fact an excellent approximation in the small - time step limit ( as shown in figure 2 ) .",
    "it can be shown in a similar fashion to section [ section3 ] that the functional ,    @xmath165    satisfies an @xmath1-theorem ( @xmath76 ) where the equality only holds if @xmath64 is given by the equilibrium form @xmath166 of ( [ eqn : f_eqm ] ) , which establishes the existence of a unique global equilibrium state .",
    "the next problem is to solve the nonlinear fpb equation , and to analyse the approach to equilibrium using the _ chapman - enskog _ ( ce ) method .",
    "according to this method , one can distinguish two stages in the evolution of the single particle distribution function @xmath64 : a rapid kinetic stage and a slow hydrodynamic stage .    in the _ kinetic _ stage",
    ", @xmath64 decays within a characteristic kinetic time @xmath16 to the so - called _ normal _ solution @xmath167 which depends on space and time only through the first few moments @xmath168 , the conserved densities , where @xmath169 are the collisional invariants . in fluid systems",
    "the time @xmath16 is the mean free time , whereas in a dpd system , @xmath16 is estimated from ( [ eqn : bbgky ] ) as @xmath170 .    in the subsequent _ hydrodynamic _ stage",
    ", @xmath171 depends only on space and time through its dependence on the conserved densities . in this stage",
    ", the solution @xmath172 of the fpb equation can be determined perturbatively , @xmath173 , as an expansion in powers of a small parameter , @xmath174 , which measures the variation of the macroscopic parameters over a characteristic kinetic length scale , @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is a typical mean velocity .",
    "therefore the @xmath152-expansion is essentially an expansion in the small parameter @xmath177 ( c.f .",
    "solution to kramers equation in ) .    in the remaining part of this section , we focus on determining the lowest order solution @xmath178 of ( [ eqn : bbgky ] ) , which is the _ local equilibrium _ distribution .",
