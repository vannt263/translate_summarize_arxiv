    "the star experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , new york , usa , investigates novel qcd phenomena at high density and high temperature in ultra - relativistic @xmath0+@xmath0 collisions .",

    "the highest center - of - mass energy ( @xmath1=200  gev ) is about a factor 10 higher than past fixed target experiments ( e.g.  cern sps @xmath7=160  gev , equivalent to @xmath1@xmath818  gev ) . the main star subdetector is a midrapidity ( @xmath9@xmath10@xmath9@xmath111.6 ) time projection chamber ( tpc , @xmath12=2  m , @xmath13=4  m ) @xcite with @xmath848,000,000 pixels . in 3 years of data taking , high statistics ( 10@xmath14@xmath11@xmath15@xmath1110@xmath16 events on tape ) for au+au , p+p and d+au at @xmath1=200 gev and au+au at @xmath1=130 gev were recorded , which enabled analyses of rare events .",

    "is a rare process ( @xmath19@xmath2010@xmath21 ) , a level-3 trigger system @xcite was used for realtime anti - nuclei identification .",
    "one central @xmath0+@xmath0 collision contains about @xmath8130,000 tpc hits and @xmath86,500 tpc tracks , which were fully reconstructed in realtime ( @xmath22@xmath11100  ms ) by 432 intel i960 cpus and 48 alpha 21264 cpus , respectively .",
    "the trigger signature was a tag onto a negative charge @xmath23=-2 , by usage of the tpc @xmath17 in realtime .",
    "as no other particles in nature are expected to have the same signature , the signature is clean . for a single track , @xmath1145 @xmath17 samples ( corresponding to 45 tpc hits ) were used for the calculation of a 70% truncated mean ( i.e.  excluding samples in the landau tail of the @xmath17 distribution ) .",
    "a track quality cut of @xmath24@xmath2523 hits per track on the level-3 trigger and @xmath24@xmath2530 in the offline analysis was applied .",
    "anti-@xmath18 candidate tracks were also required to have a distance - of - closest - approach to the event collision vertex of @xmath117.5  cm ( trigger ) and @xmath113.0  cm ( offline ) .",
    "the tpc @xmath17 resolution was 11% ( trigger ) and 8% ( offline ) .",
    "the particle identification cuts were 0.7@xmath26@xmath17/@xmath27 ( trigger ) and 0.88@xmath26@xmath17/@xmath27@xmath261.28 ( offline ) , where @xmath27 denotes the expected bethe - bloch ionization .",
    "for a particle or anti - particle of @xmath28=1  gev / c , the level-3 trigger @xmath28 resolution is @xmath82% ( at an solenoidal magnetic field of @xmath29=0.5  t ) and the track finder efficiency @xmath30@xmath875% . at the beginning of high luminosity rhic spills ,",
    "an level-3 trigger anti-@xmath18 candidate enhancement factor of @xmath204.2 was achieved .",
    "as nuclei are completely made of matter , there is trivially no anti - matter in the initial state .",
    "the dominant anti - nuclei production mechanism is 2-step , namely _ ( 1 ) _ pair production of @xmath31@xmath32 , @xmath33@xmath34 , followed by _ ( 2 ) _ coalescence , i.e.the anti - nucleon wave functions overlap inside a homogenity volume . for the systematic study of the @xmath35 dependence of production yields , it is useful to define an _ invariant yield _    @xmath36    with @xmath31=@xmath37/@xmath35 .    = ln(@xmath17/@xmath27 ) ( ratio of measured and expected ionization ) for the final anti-@xmath5 yield .",

    "an additional motivation for the investigation of anti-@xmath18 production in the laboratory is the possibility of comparison to anti-@xmath18 production in the universe .",
    "recently , a search for anti-@xmath18 in the earth orbit was performed by the space shuttle - bound experiment ams @xcite .",
    "two possible production mechanisms are known . on the one hand , as @xmath2024% of all @xmath18 in the universe is primordial and was formed at @xmath22@xmath81  s. thus , an interesting question is , if primordial anti-@xmath18 exists , too . on the other hand , @xmath31@xmath35 , @xmath43@xmath35 ,",
