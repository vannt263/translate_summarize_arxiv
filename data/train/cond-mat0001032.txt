    "40004000  = 1000        the problem of layered magnetic systems is of interest both from theoretical and practical point of view @xcite",
    ". here belong , e.g. , quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) perovskites , ferromagnetic monolayers and ultrathin films .",
    "we consider the heisenberg model with small parameters of the interlayer coupling @xmath3 and easy - axis anisotropy @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the in - plane exchange parameter ) .",
    "this case permits a regular consideration since the magnetic transition temperature is small , @xmath6 which is reminiscent of weak itinerant magnets .    at not too low temperatures @xmath7 the standard spin - wave theory ( swt )",
    "is insufficient to describe correctly thermodynamics of such systems .",
    "somewhat better results can be obtained within the self - consistent theory ( sswt ) @xcite , which takes into account the temperature renormalization of @xmath8 and @xmath9 however , the values of the ordering temperature in sswt are still too high in comparison with experimental ones , and the critical behavior is quite incorrect .    to improve radically sswt , the summation of leading contributions in all orders of perturbation theory should be performed . to this end",
    "we use the renormalization group ( rg ) approach similar to that of ref .",
    "this approach is valid outside the critical region which is very narrow for layered systems .",
    "the same results can be obtained by direct summation of rpa - type corrections to spin - wave interaction vertex .",
    "the result for the relative ( sublattice ) magnetization @xmath10 reads @xcite @xmath11 \\label{frg}\\ ] ] with @xmath12 , @xmath13 other quantities are given in the table 1 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the spin - wave velocity , @xmath16 is the renormalization parameter for intralayer coupling , @xmath17 . the inequality @xmath18 should to be satisfied for the validity of ( [ frg ] ) .",
    "note that the classical regime is realized only for very large @xmath19 .",
    "the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 in ( [ frg ] ) are the temperature - renormalized values of interlayer coupling and anisotropy parameters , and for @xmath22 ( i.e. beyond the critical region , see below ) @xmath23 thus the anisotropy and interlayer coupling are strongly renormalized with temperature which should be taken into account when treating the experimental data . in the quantum regime ,",
    "the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are ground - state ( quantum - renormalized ) anisotropy and interlayer coupling ( for ferromagnetic case the ground - state renormalizations are absent ) . in the classical regime ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath24 are ` lattice - renormalized ' parameters of anisotropy and interlayer coupling , i.e. the corresponding parameters of the continuum model with the same thermodynamic properties as the original lattice model .",
    "\\(i ) low temperatures , @xmath27 the analysis of non - uniform susceptibility shows that the excitations in the whole brillouin zone have spin - wave nature .",
    "only first term in the square brackets in ( [ frg ] ) is to be taken into account and the magnetization also demonstrates the spin - wave behavior .",
    "\\(ii ) intermediate temperatures , @xmath28 ( @xmath7 is of the same order as @xmath29 ) .",
    "close to the center of the brillouin zone the excitations still have the spin - wave nature , while for large enough momenta they have non - spin - wave character . only in - plane",
    "( two - dimensional ) fluctuations are important in this regime .",
    "all the terms in ( [ frg ] ) , except for the last , are important , which leads to significant modification of the dependence @xmath30 in comparison with swt .",
    "\\(iii ) critical region , @xmath31(@xmath32 ) . in this regime",
    "the spin - wave excitations are present only for momenta @xmath33 ( hydrodynamic region ) whereas at all other @xmath34 excitations have non - spin - wave character .",
    "the thermodynamics in this case is determined by 3d ( or ising - like ) fluctuations .",
    "the contribution of @xmath35 is of the same order as other terms in the square brackets of ( [ frg ] ) and the rg approach is unable to describe the thermodynamics in this regime .",
    "the values of critical exponents can be corrected in comparison with sswt with the use of the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "for the isotropic quasi-2d antiferromagnet we obtain @xcite @xmath36 ^{1-\\beta _ 3}\\left [ \\frac 1{1-a_0}\\left ( 1-\\frac t{t_n}\\right ) \\right ] ^{2\\beta _ 3 }   \\label{magncr1}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 and @xmath38    up to some ( unknown ) constant @xmath39 we have for the transition temperature the result @xmath40 .",

    "for the quantum antiferromagnets the value of @xmath42 can be calculated by the @xmath2 expansion @xcite , @xmath43 the value of @xmath44 for the same case can be deduced from experimental data on layered magnetic compounds @xcite , @xmath45    for practical purposes , simple interpolation expressions for the functions @xmath46 which permit to describe the crossover temperature region , are useful .",
