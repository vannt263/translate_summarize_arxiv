    "such shock waves are belived to play a significant role in the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "metals ( heavy elements ) produced by stars are transported into the igm by shock waves from galaxies and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of metal ejection depends on many factors and parameters , e.g. mass of a parent ( for metals ) galaxy , star formation rate , density profile etc . on one hand",
    "massive galaxies should produce and may throw out a sufficient part of metals because of high velocity shock waves .",

    "low - velocity shock waves do not lead to the radiative precursor formation @xcite .",

    "here we briefly describe our method of calculation . the full description of the method and the references to the atomic data can be found in @xcite .",
    "we study the ionization and thermal evolution of a lagrangian element of cooling gas . in our calculations",
    "we consider all ionization states of the elements h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si and fe . we take into account the following major processes in a collisinal gas : collisional ionization , radiative and dielectronic recombination as well as charge transfer in collisions with hydrogen and helium atoms and ions .    the system of time - dependent ionization state equations should be complemented by the temperature equation .",
    "neglecting the change of number of particles in the system ( for fully ionized hydrogen and helium it remains approximately constant ) the gas temperature is determined by = - n_e n_h a n k_b where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the electron and total hydrogen number densities , @xmath22 is cooling rate , @xmath23 is a constant equal to @xmath24 for isochoric and @xmath25 for isobaric cooling , @xmath26 is the boltzman constant .",
    "cooling is isobaric when the cooling time is much greater then the dynamical time of a system , @xmath27 and it is isochoric when the time ratio is opposite , @xmath28 .",

    "for the solar metallicity we adopt the abundances reported by @xcite , except ne for which the enhanced abundance is adopted @xcite . in all our calculations",
    "we assume the helium mass fraction @xmath29 .",
    "we solve a set of 96 coupled equations ( 95 for ionization states and one for temperature ) using a variable - coefficient ordinary differential equation solver @xcite .",
    "we consider pure collisional ionization model , so we should constrain shock wave velocity by a value that does not lead to the radiative precursor formation .",
    "the precusor is photoionized by the radiation field emitted by a shocked gas , and consequently the initial ionization states in gas behind a shock front depends on the spectrum emitted by a shock wave .",
    "a stable photoionization precursor will be formed when the ionization front velocity in the gas approaching the shock becomes larger than the shock velocity .",
    "this condition is satisfied for shock velocity higher than @xmath30  km  s@xmath1 @xcite or shock temperature @xmath31  k. thus , we study the shock waves with temperature @xmath32 .",
    "we constrain our calculations by lower value @xmath33  km  s@xmath1 corresponded to @xmath34  k. we assume that the gas temperature just behind a shock front instantaneously becomes equal to @xmath35 , but the ionization composition relaxes from that corresponded to temperature @xmath36 before the front . during the relaxation period",
    "a gas cools more efficiently due to higher collisional ionization rates of low ionic states existed in the postshock gas , and the ionization composition tends to fit such thermal evolution . in general , for fixed other paramters ( density , metallicity ) the ionization composition tends to that at a corresponding temeperature in a gas collisionally cooled from @xmath37  k. however , depending on the relation between @xmath36 and @xmath35 the relaxation period needs different time .",
    "the ionization times of h and he are longer than these of metals , so that the influence of h and he on the thermal evolution of gas just behind a shock is expected to be dominant . as an example figure  [ figtihhe ] presents the h and he ionization states in a gas isochorically cooled from @xmath37  k for @xmath38 , 0.1 and solar metallicities .",
    "there is no significant dependence of the hydrogen states on metallicty , in contrast to that the helium states show remarkable distinction .",
    "the considerable dependence of the h and he states on temperature is clearly seen .",
    "thus , taking different ionization composition corresponded @xmath39 in a gas before shock wave one can expect differences in the thermal evolution of the postshock gas .",
    "but the closer @xmath36 is to @xmath35 , the smaller distinction of the thermal evolution is from that for a gas collisionally cooled from @xmath37  k. a gas temperature before shock wave can vary in wide range .",
    "for example , a gas can be relaxed from some previous shock interaction or heated by galactic or extragalactic ionizing radiation .",
    "so it is difficult to choose more or less common initial temperature .",
    "the gaseous temperature in hii regions is @xmath40  k , the typical temperature of the igm is @xmath41  k. to coinstrain calculations we suppose that the initial temperature of a gas before shock wave equals @xmath42  k , and a gas has the ionization composition obtained in the non - equilibrium ( time - dependent ) model at this temperature and given metallicity .",

    "one note that the difference between cooling rates behind shock waves and the rate for the fiducial model reaches maximum for solar metallicity and depends strongly on @xmath35 , but for any @xmath35 the cooling rates coincide at @xmath57  k. thus , we can conclude that the cooling rate in a gas behind a shock wave differs considerably from the cooling rate for the fiducial model , @xmath58  k , which is usually used to study the thermal evolution of a gas .",
