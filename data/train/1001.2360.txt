    "a pulsar releases its rotational energy as a relativistic magnetized outflow called a pulsar wind .",
    "the pulsar wind collides with surrounding supernova ejecta , forms the termination shock , and creates a pwn @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of the pulsar wind particles occurs at the termination shock and the pwn consists of the magnetic field and the ultrarelativistic particles @xcite .",
    "such a created pwn emits photons ranging from radio to tev @xmath0-rays via the synchrotron radiation and the inverse compton scattering .",
    "current status of theoretical models as well as observational confrontations is reviewed by gaensler & slane ( 2006 ) @xcite .",
    "the crab nebula is one of the best studied pwn at almost all observable wavelengths including its central pulsar , called the crab pulsar .",
    "kennel & coroniti ( 1984 ) @xcite studied the spatial structure of the crab nebula , assuming that it is a steady state object ( kc model ) .",
    "they found that the magnetization parameter @xmath1 , the ratio of the electromagnetic energy flux to the particle energy flux just upstream the termination shock of the pulsar wind , must be as small as 0.003 to explain the observed dynamical properties of the crab nebula .",
    "atoyan & aharonian ( 1996 ) @xcite succeeded to reconstruct the current observed broadband spectrum of the crab nebula by the use of the kc model .",
    "the kc model is not fit to consider the evolution because it is a steady state model .",
    "however , it is very important to consider the spectral evolution of the crab nebula .",
    "we need to consider the spectral evolution to explain the flux decrease rate of the crab nebula at radio and optical wavelengths @xcite . moreover , we need to understand the spectral evolution of pwne .",
    "recent observations found many pwne which have a variety of the characteristics , such as the ages , the expansion velocities , the morphologies , and the spectra of pwne .",
    "this variety must be related to the spectral evolution of pwne .",
    "for example , de jager & djannati - ata ( 2008 ) @xcite discussed the possibility that the aged pwne can be seen as the tev @xmath0-ray sources without a strong x - ray counterpart .    in this paper , we revisit a spectral evolution model of pwne .",
    "although several spectral evolution models of pwne have been studied @xcite , several issues still remain to be further clarified . in our model , the pwn is simply treated as an expanding uniform sphere",
    ". we do not take into account effects of the spatial structure of the pwn , since it is somewhat costly and too detailed to see the whole spectrum .",
    "the energy inside the pwn is injected from the pulsar spin - down energy , which is distributed between the relativistic particles and the magnetic field with a constant ratio .",
    "our simple model can describe the observed basic features .",
    "we study the spectral evolution of the crab nebula for the first application of our model .",
    "the crab nebula can be used as a calibrator of our model when it will be applied to other pwne in future . in section [ model ] , we describe our model of the pwn evolution . in section",
    "[ crab ] , we apply this model to the crab nebula . in section [ discussion_conclusion ] , discussions and conclusions",
    "in this paper , we assume that the pwn is a uniform sphere expanding at a constant velocity @xmath2 .",
    "the assumption of a constant velocity @xmath2 is the easiest way to take into account the expansion of the pwn , although the real behavior of the expansion velocity could be more complex as the work made by gelfand et al .",
    "( 2009 ) @xcite .",
    "we consider that the age of the pwn is younger than 10kyr in this paper and that the constant velocity @xmath2 would be a good assumption in this range .    for the components inside the pwn",
    ", we assume that the pwn is composed of only magnetic field and relativistic electron - positron plasma , both of which are injected from the pulsar inside the pwn .",
    "we divide the energy injection from the pulsar into the magnetic field energy @xmath3 and the relativistic particle energy @xmath4 using the time independent parameter @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the fraction parameter @xmath5 is the injection ratio of the magnetic field energy to the spin - down energy .",
    "the fraction parameter @xmath5 in our model is similar to the magnetization parameter @xmath1 in the kc model , although they are not the same .",
    "the magnetization parameter @xmath1 is the ratio @xmath7 at the pulsar wind region immediately upstream the termination shock . on the other hand",
    ", the fraction parameter @xmath5 pertains to @xmath8 into the pwn region uniformly .    for the particle injection",
    ", we also need to determine the injection spectrum of the relativistic particles . following venter & de jager ( 2006 ) @xcite , we assume that the injection spectrum of the relativistic particles @xmath9 obeys a broken power - law @xmath10 where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor of the relativistic electron and positron .",
    "we introduce time independent parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 which are the minimum , break and the maximum lorentz factors and the power - law indices at the low and high energy ranges of the injection spectra , respectively .",
    "we require that the normalization @xmath16 satisfies the following equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mass of an electron ( or positron ) and the speed of light , respectively .      because the magnetic field lines are stretching and winding , it is difficult to model the evolution of the magnetic field in the context of the uniform pwn .",
    "we have to solve the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations to determine the realistic magnetic field evolution @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that the magnetic field evolution are determined in the form of the magnetic energy conservation , @xmath20    in this model , the magnetic field approximately evolves as @xmath21 for @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the initial spin - down time of the pulsar . note that this magnetic field evolution model may be ad hoc , but its behavior is very similar to those adopted in other works @xcite .",
    "for example , rees & gunn ( 1974 ) @xcite consider the stretching and winding of the magnetic field line inside the uniform pwn and gives @xmath21 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 for @xmath22 , where @xmath27 is the braking index of the pulsar .",
    "another example of de jager et al .",
    "( 2009 ) @xcite gives @xmath28 in their calculation of non - relativistic mhd equations .",
    "we assume that the distribution of the particles in the pwn is isotropic , and then the particle distribution function can be easily volume integrated and is described by @xmath29 .",
    "the evolution of the particle distribution @xmath29 is given by the continuity equation in the energy space @xmath30    we consider the cooling effects of the relativistic particles @xmath31 including the synchrotron radiation , the inverse compton scattering off the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , and the adiabatic expansion , i.e. , @xmath32 note that the inverse compton cooling @xmath33 does not depend on time because we consider that the target photon field is only the cmb .",
    "as the cooling effects , we do not include the inverse compton scattering off the synchrotron radiation field for simplicity because it never be a more important cooling process than the synchrotron cooling .",
    "we include it in the calculation of the radiation spectrum .",
    "in this section , we apply our model to the crab nebula as the standard calibrator of our model .",
    "the crab nebula is one of the best observed pwn at almost all observable wavelengths .",
    "the crab pulsar has the period @xmath34 , its time derivative @xmath35 and the braking index 2.51 .",
    "the progenitor supernova is sn1054 , which means the age of the crab nebula @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath37 . here , we adopt that the crab nebula is a sphere of the diameter @xmath38 . combining with @xmath36 ,",
    "the constant expansion velocity is @xmath39 , which is close to the observed expansion velocity of the crab nebula .      .",
    "[ f1 ] ]    .used parameters to reproduce the current observed spectrum of the crab nebula.[tbl-1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ f1 ] shows the current observed spectrum and our calculated one of the crab nebula .",
    "the adopted parameters are shown in table [ tbl-1 ] . as seen in figure [ f1 ] ,",
    "the ssc flux is stronger than the ic / cmb flux at @xmath0-rays    the fraction parameter @xmath5 governs the absolute values of the fluxes and the flux ratio of the inverse compton scattering to the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the kc model obtained @xmath40 from the viewpoint of the current dynamical structure of the crab nebula , while we determine @xmath41 from the viewpoint of the spectral evolution .    in our calculation , the current magnetic field strength of the crab nebula turns out to be @xmath42 , which is smaller than @xmath43 used by atoyan & aharonian @xcite .",
    "this difference of the magnetic field strength can be explained as follows .",
    "atoyan & aharonian @xcite adopted @xmath43 from the kc model and adjusted the particle number to reproduce the observations .",
    "they applied a roughly half a spin - down power compared with the kc model to reproduce the spectrum , thus another half is missing . on the other hand",
    ", all the injected spin - down power is distributed between the particle and the magnetic field energies in our model .       from the birth .",
    "the thick solid , thin dotted and the thin dashed lines are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 from birth , respectively . each line represents the total spectra which are the sum of the synchrotron , ic / cmb and the ssc spectrum .",
    "used parameters are the same as in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "[ f2 ] ]    figure [ f2 ] shows the spectral evolution .",
    "as seen in figure [ f2 ] , the synchrotron flux decreases with time and the ssc flux also decreases with time owing to decrease of the synchrotron flux , while the ic / cmb flux decreases more slowly than the ssc flux .",
    "this supports the view that old pwne can be observed as @xmath0-ray sources which are faint at x - rays .",
    "the radio / optical observations of the crab nebula found that the radio / optical flux of the crab nebula is decreasing with time .",
    "the inferred rate of the radio flux decrease is @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "our model predicts the current rate @xmath48 and this is almost consistent with the observation",
    ". the inferred rate of the optical continuum flux decrease is @xmath49 calibrated at 5000  @xcite .",
    "our model predicts the current rate @xmath50 , this is by a factor of 2.5 smaller than observation .",
    "note that the trend that the decreasing rate increases with frequency is the same as the observations .     from the birth .",
    "the thick solid , thin dotted and the thin dashed lines are those at @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively . the dot - dashed line is the total injected particles until the age @xmath46 .",
    "used parameters are the same as in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "[ f3 ] ]    to understand the details in figure [ f2 ] , we show the evolution of the particle energy distribution in figure [ f3 ] . for comparison , the total injected particles till 10kyr without the cooling effects",
    "is plotted in the dot - dashed line in figure [ f3 ] .    in figure",
    "[ f3 ] , we can divide the evolution of the particle distribution in four energy ranges .",
    "first , for @xmath51 , the particle number increases with time . owing to this increase of the high energy particles ,",
    "the ic / cmb flux at 10kyr is larger than that at 1kyr above 10 tev .",
    "secondly , for @xmath52 , the evolution of the particle distribution is complex . the distribution is softer than the injection distribution because of the synchrotron cooling in this range",
    "thirdly , for @xmath53 , the change of the particle distribution is small , the difference between the dashed line ( 10kyr ) and dot - dashed line ( 10kyr without the cooling effects ) is only a factor of two .",
    "this leads to an important conclusion that the radio flux decrease is mainly because of the decrease of the magnetic field . combining with the observations of the radio flux decrease",
    ", our model of the magnetic field evolution can be near the truth .",
    "lastly , there exist the particles whose energy is lower than @xmath11 .",
    "this is because the adiabatic cooling is still effective at low energy .",
    "our model of the magnetic field evolution is somewhat ad hoc .",
    "the time dependence of the magnetic field strength @xmath54 for @xmath22 is assumed . this is close to other theoretical considerations @xcite . moreover , because our result of the radio flux decrease of the crab nebula is almost consistent with the observation , our model of the magnetic field evolution can be near the truth .    for the injection spectrum of the particle distribution , the acceleration of the particles is an unsolved problem and we adopt the broken power - law injection . it should be noted that one of the important conclusion in our study that old pwne can be observed as @xmath0-ray sources without a strong x - ray counterpart is not affected by the broken power - law assumption .",
    "this is because the low energy particles do not contribute to x - ray and high energy @xmath0-ray emissions .      in this paper",
    ", we built a model of the spectral evolution of pwne and applied this model to the crab nebula as a calibrator of our model .",
    "especially , the magnetic field evolution model is unique and can be close to the reality .",
    "the flux decrease of the @xmath0-rays is more moderate than radio to x - rays , because the magnetic field decreases rapidly .",
    "this result means that old pwne can be observed as @xmath0-ray sources without a strong x - ray counterpart .",
    "de jager & djannati - ata ( 2008 ) @xcite also suggested that old pwne can be observed as tev unidentified sources , because the x - ray emitting particles are cooled more rapidly than tev @xmath0-ray emitting particles .",
    "this is not the same reason as our conclusion .",
    "the current observed spectrum of the crab nebula is reconstructed when the fraction parameter has a small value @xmath55 .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of the magnetization parameter @xmath40 obtained by kennel & coroniti ( 1984a)@xcite .",
    "they obtained @xmath40 from the viewpoint of the current dynamical structure of the crab nebula , while we determine @xmath41 from the viewpoint of the spectral evolution .",
    "the smaller value of the current magnetic field @xmath56 than inferred value @xmath57 in most of other papers is needed to reconstruct the observed spectrum of the crab nebula .",
    "recent study by volpi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) @xcite indicated that the spatially averaged magnetic field strength @xmath58 in their relativistic mhd simulation .",
    "this is close to our value of the magnetic field strength .",
    "our model can predict the spectral evolution of the crab nebula , the observed flux decrease of the crab nebula at radio wavelengths can be explained by our magnetic field evolution model .",
    "the observed flux decrease rate of the crab nebula at optical wavelengths is somewhat larger than our model , but the trend that the decreasing rate increases with frequency is the same as observations .    finally , because we can reproduce the current spectrum of the typical pwn with the spectral evolution model , we can apply this to other pwne",
    ". we will be able to study whether the observed variations of the pwne can be understood by the spectral evolution or other effects should be included .",
