    "in contrast to most astronomical objects ( such as planets , stars and galaxies ) , the universe as a whole is usually considered to be non - rotational . however , the possibility that the universe rotates should not be ignored , since solutions of gr corresponding to a rotating universe have been found @xcite indicating that a global rotation is physically allowed .",
    "although it is widely assumed that galaxies align randomly and have zero net angular momentum , there have been many investigations on the general alignment of galaxies .",

    "rotational perturbations may also be used to determine whether or not the universe is open or closed @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of global rotation is of interest in many different aspects of cosmology , and constraint of the rotation speed of the universe is important .",
    "the most popular approach to constrain the magnitude of the global rotation speed is to make use of data from the cmba because of their precision .",
    "most discussions @xcite have focused on homogeneous cosmological models , i.e. bianchi models @xcite . to be consistent with obeservations , only bianchi type v , vii@xmath4 , vii@xmath3 and ix models , which include the robertson - walker model as a special case , are considered .",
    "the constraints of the global rotation speed obtained depend on the parameters of the models . besides , shear and vorticity are inseparable in these works @xcite , i.e. zero shear automatically implies zero vorticity .",
    "there are many other approaches to constrain the global rotation . based on the idea that a global rotation induces a total net spin of galaxies , the global rotation",
    "can be limited @xcite . moreover ,",
    "empirical relations between angular momenta and mass of galaxies / clusters , such as @xmath5 for spiral galaxies and @xmath6 for clusters can be explained by the global rotation @xcite .",
    "the acceleration caused by the global rotation may be used to explain parts of the accelerating expansion of our universe , and thus the global rotation can be constrained by supernova type ia data @xcite .",
    "recently , some studies of the cmb polarization induced by the global rotation are published @xcite providing potential constraints in the future .    to develop a model that preserves the homogeneity and isotropy of the mean cmb",
    ", we study the rotation of the universe as a perturbation in the robertson - walker framework with a cosmological constant in this paper .",
    "unlike the bianchi models , such an approach allows to have non - zero rotation but trivial shear .",
    "since the global rotation does not have any influences on the 1st - order sachs - wolfe effect ( sw effect ) , we need to calculate the metric up to 2nd - order perturbations and the 2nd - order sw effect .",

    "<S> models of a rotating universe have been studied widely since gdel @xcite , who showed an example that is consistent with general relativity ( gr ) . by now , the possibility of a rotating universe has been discussed comprehensively in the framework of some types of bianchi s models , such as type v , vii and ix @xcite , and different approaches have been proposed to constrain the rotation . </S>",
    "<S> recent discoveries of some non - gaussian properties of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( cmba ) @xcite , such as the suppression of the quadrupole and the alignment of some multipoles draw attention to some bianchi models with rotation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , cosmological data , such as those of the cmba , strongly prefer a homogeneous and isotropic model . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is of interest to discuss the rotation of the universe as a perturbation of the robertson - walker metric , to constrain the rotating speed by cosmological data and to discuss whether it could be the origin of the non - gaussian properties of the cmba mentioned above . here </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the general form of the metric ( up to 2nd - order perturbations ) which is compatible with the rotation perturbation in a flat @xmath0-cdm universe . by comparing the 2nd - order sachs - wolfe effect @xcite due to rotation with the cmba data , we constrain the angular speed of the rotation to be less than @xmath1 rad yr@xmath2 at the last scattering surface . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the first constraint on the shear - free rotation of a @xmath0cdm universe . </S>"
