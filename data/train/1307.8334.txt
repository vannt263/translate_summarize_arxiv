    "clusters of galaxies are the largest virialized structures in the universe , and they gravitationally bind hot thin - thermal plasma ( intracluster medium ; icm ) . the high temperature reaching up to several @xmath7 k make the icm to produce x - rays via thermal bremsstrahlung .",

    "the metals in galaxies are thought to be exported to the icm via galaxy wind ( mathews & baker 1971 ) and/or ram pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "these metals are highly ionized in collisional ionization equilibrium and excited metal ions emit atomic lines in the x - ray range .",

    "thus the emission lines observed in the x - ray spectrum reflect integrated activities of both types of supernovae in the galaxies , and enable us to study chemical enrichment history of the icm , which is a major component of the known baryon in the universe .",

    "these systematic errors are taken into account in figure  [ f9](b ) .",
    "figure  [ f9](b ) shows that both the sn  ia and sn  ii numbers are in good positive correlation with the gas mass , including ms  1512.4 + 3647 which is at a medium redshift , though the sn  ia number of ms  1512.4 + 3647 is slightly above the correlation .",

    "2002 ) . since massive stars above @xmath748 @xmath75",
    "cause a core collapse with a short lifetime , the history of sn  ii should follow the curve of sfh , which is relatively flat at @xmath76 , peaked at @xmath3 , and then decreases by about one order of magnitude toward @xmath4 ( e.g. strolger et al .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the sn  ii contribution in ms  1512.4 + 3647 ( figure  [ f9](b ) ) which is similar to that in awm  7 .",
    "for example , in the sfh models ( m1 and m2 ) in strolger et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the number of star formation per unit volume at @xmath77 is only @xmath78% of the integrated value in @xmath79 .",
    "this suggests that the number of sn  ii in ms  1512.4 + 3647 would be lower than the nearby values by about @xmath78% , which is within the error as seen in figure  [ f9](b ) .",
    "the history of the sn  ia rate is more complicated , because the lifetime function of binary systems needs to be convolved with the star formation rate ( e.g. borgani et al . 2008 ) . in general , the sn  ia rate is peaked later in time ( at smaller @xmath80 ) and prolonged longer than the sn  ii rate history .",
    "in fact , a mild decrease of the sn  ia rate in the cluster environment is found from @xmath17 to @xmath4 by a factor of @xmath81 ( gal - yam et al .",
    "our result in figure  [ f9](b ) suggests a low sn  ia rate in @xmath82 , since the sn  ia numbers normalized by the gas mass are the same between ms  1512.2 + 3647 and nearby clusters . if one assumes the evolution of the sn  ia rate implied from the field galaxy data ( for example , model 1n2.3 in solid line in figure  10b of loewenstein 2006 )",
    ", the number of sn  ia would increase by @xmath83% from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , namely in about 4 gy . in this case , the sn  ia point of ms  1512.4 + 3647 in figure  [ f9](b ) would exceed the level of awm  7 when 4  gy passed , causing some deviation ( from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ) from the present linear relationship in this figure .",
    "therefore , models of the sn  ia evolution with steeper gradient and/or more contribution at larger redshifts ( for example , model 2h1.05wxst1 in solid line in figure  11b of loewenstein 2006 ) would be favored .",

    "<S> the cluster of galaxies ms 1512.4 + 3647 ( @xmath0 ) was observed with suzaku for 270 ks . besides the fe abundance , the abundances of mg , si , s , and ni </S>",
    "<S> are separately determined for the first time in a medium redshift cluster ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the derived abundance pattern of ms  1512.4 + 3647 is consistent with those of nearby clusters , suggesting that the system has similar contributions from supernovae ( sne )  ia and sne  ii to nearby clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the number ratio of sne  ii to sne  ia is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated total numbers of both sne  ii and sne  ia against gas mass indicate similar correlation with those for the nearby clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance results of ms  1512.4 + 3647 is consistent with the standard scenario that the sn  ii rate history roughly follows the star - formation history which has a peak at @xmath3 and then declines by about one order of magnitude toward @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the similar number of sne  ia to the nearby clusters suggests that the sn  ia rate declines steeply from @xmath5 to @xmath6 and/or sn  ia explosions occurred predominantly at larger redshifts . </S>"
