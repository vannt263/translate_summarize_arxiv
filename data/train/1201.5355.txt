    "the `` pure '' @xmath0 ( `` baryon '' minus `` lepton '' ) model is a peculiar choice from the the subset of the minimal standard model ( @xmath3 ) extensions obeying the @xmath4 gauge symmetry .",
    "it is defined by precluding the mixing between the two @xmath5 groups @xcite .    in this report",
    "we will analyse some peculiar processes of the minimal @xmath0 extension of the standard model at future @xmath1 linear colliders ( lcs ) .",
    "for all practical purposes , we generally refer to an international linear collider ( @xmath6 ) for a sub - tev / tev prototype and to a compact linear collider ( @xmath7 ) for a tev / multi - tev design .",
    "firstly we will analyse the cross section and luminosity impact on the significance of the higgs - strahlung ( off @xmath2 ) process , with emphasis on both single and double higgs production .",
    "finally , we will consider the case in which an higgs state is produced in association with heavy neutrinos from direct @xmath2 production .",
    "all these channels are based on the direct production of a @xmath8 boson ( which is generally dominantly coupled to leptons @xcite ) , hence a lepton collider is the most suitable environment for probing the considered model .",
    "finally , we remark that all the choices of parameters used in the following analysis are compatible with both experimental and theoretical constraints ( see reference  @xcite ) .",
    "among the production mechanisms of the minimal @xmath0 model , a non-@xmath3-like one for producing a single higgs boson final state ( either the light or heavy one ) is higgs - strahlung off a @xmath2 boson , i.e. , @xmath9 .    as shown in figure  [ h1zp_1tev]([h1zp_3tev ] ) a light higgs boson",
    "can be produced in association with a @xmath2 boson of @xmath10(@xmath11 ) tev mass with cross sections of @xmath12(@xmath13 ) fb .",
    "only the light higgs boson has been considered , being the case of a heavy higgs boson with same mass just the symmetric one under @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to remark that for @xmath15 ( decoupling limit ) , _ this is the only heavy higgs production mechanism allowed_. moreover , the higgs - strahlung off @xmath2 mechanism is not suitable for the lhc @xcite , making a multi - tev linear collider the ultimate chance for its discovery .",
    "this mechanism is absent in scalar extensions of the @xmath3 in which the gauge content is not changed .    with @xmath2 boson mass assumed to be known ( see , for example , references  @xcite ) , the discovery potential for this channel is here presented .",
    "we first study the effect of initial state radiation ( isr ) on the cross sections for the strahlung of a light higgs state .",
    "figure  [ a ] clearly shows a linear dependence of @xmath16 , the centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy that maximises the cross section , as a function of the higgs mass only .",
    "interpolating , we find the useful relation : @xmath17 hence , per fixed higgs and @xmath2 boson masses , the discovery potential can be maximised by fixing the cm energy to @xmath16 .    as for the integrated luminosity required to start probing the values of @xmath18 in the @xmath0 model , benchmark scenarios use the usual @xmath19 ( @xmath20 gev ) and",
    "@xmath21 ( @xmath22 gev ) decays . in analogy with the study of reference  @xcite , the decay mode @xmath23 is considered as the most suitable . regarding the background ,",
    "the relevant one is found to be @xmath24 ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 ( where , again , the muons come exclusively from the @xmath2 boson ) .",
    "the pure @xmath28 background is two orders of magnitude below the latter two , hence it is neglected here .    for both signal and background ,",
    "we have assumed standard acceptance cuts ( for muons and quarks ) at a lc  @xcite , and a window on the invariant mass @xmath29 gev to roughly emulate the detector resolution .",
    "for the muons , we require @xmath30 , always wider than the di - muon resolution for the values of the gauge coupling here considered  @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath31-quark tagging efficiency has been assumed to be @xmath32 according to reference  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath33-boson reconstruction efficiency has been set to @xmath34 as a reasonable approximation .",
    "figure  [ lumi_s_zph1 ] shows the discovery reach of a lc in these conditions , as a function of the scalar mixing angle @xmath18 .",
    "the discovery power for the two decay modes of the light higgs boson are comparable .",
    "also , very small angles require high luminosity and big values of @xmath35 to be probed , excluding @xmath36 for which the @xmath37 and @xmath2 bosons do not couple .",
    "numerical results for the @xmath38(@xmath39)@xmath40 discovery potential of @xmath37-strahlung off @xmath8 are collected in table  [ 5sigma_zph1 ] .",
    "the higgs - strahlung off @xmath2 channel is the fundamental process for producing the heavy higgs boson for scalar mixing angles close to decoupling .",
    "decoupled from the @xmath3 particles , the heavy higgs could be a very long - lived particle ( decaying into peculiar final states through heavy neutrino pairs @xcite ) . when @xmath41 instead , @xmath3 decay modes become dominant . in both cases",
    ", the mass of the heavy scalar can be measured from the @xmath2 recoil mass .",
    "@xmath20 gev    .__minimum integrated luminosities ( in fb@xmath42 ) for a @xmath43(@xmath44 ) discovery as a function of the scalar mixing angle @xmath18 , for selected @xmath8 boson masses and @xmath45 couplings for the light higgs boson .",
    "all values above the given @xmath18 are probed for the luminosity in table . for @xmath46 , all angles below @xmath47 are probed with the luminosity in the table . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -0.5 cm",
    "the @xmath48 process is a peculiar signature of the @xmath0 model , not present in many other @xmath3 extensions .",
    "a @xmath46 boson is radiated from the @xmath2 boson and it subsequently decays into a light higgs boson pair with cross sections much bigger than the usual double higgs - stralung process .",
    "it vanishes in the decoupling regimes ( both for @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .    for @xmath51 tev ,",
    "a heavy higgs boson with @xmath52 gev mass can pair produce the light higgs boson with cross sections well above the fb level up to @xmath53 gev , reaching @xmath12 fb for small ( but not negligible ) values of the mixing angle ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) .",
    "if a @xmath2 boson of @xmath10 tev mass is considered , a heavier @xmath37 can be pair produced .",
    "cross sections are bigger than @xmath55 fb for @xmath56 gev and @xmath57 fb , again for small ( but not negligible ) values of the mixing angle ( see figure  [ h2-h1h1zp ] ) .",
    "finally , a possibility is to use the heavy neutrino as a source of light higgs bosons . it is a very peculiar feature of the @xmath0 model , allowing for a direct measurement of the @xmath58 coupling assuming that @xmath59 is kinematically forbidden ( @xmath60 being the heavy(light ) physical neutrino ) .",
    "a lc is again the most suitable environment to test this mechanism , not only because of substantial @xmath8 production , but also because the possibility of tuning the @xmath61 energy on the @xmath2 boson peak will enhance the @xmath2 production cross section ( and consequently the signal ) by a factor of roughly @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , the branching ratio ( @xmath63 ) of a heavy neutrino into a light higgs boson and a light neutrino is @xmath64 ( at the most @xcite ) , when allowed .    at an illustrative @xmath61 energy of @xmath65 tev ,",
    "the cross section for @xmath66 with @xmath67 gev is @xmath68  fb for a heavy neutrino of @xmath69 gev mass , decreasing to @xmath57 fb when a mass of @xmath70 gev is considered , for a good range in the mixing angle .",
    "as intimated , on the @xmath2 peak , the @xmath71 pair production is enhanced by a factor @xmath72 , with cross sections @xmath73  pb for a large portion of the allowed parameter space , and @xmath74  fb whatever @xmath18 is .",
