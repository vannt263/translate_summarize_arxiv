    "when a distant bipartite system is given as two parties , alice and bob , it is natural to restrict their operations to local operation and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite because it is not so easy to realize a quantum operation across both of the distant parties .",
    "locc operations can be classified by the direction of classical communication . when the direction of classical communication is restricted to only one direction , the locc operation",
    "is called a one - way locc .",
    "otherwise , it is called a two - way locc .",
    "although a one - way locc operation requires only one - round classical communication , a two - way locc operation does multiple - round classical communication . in this case , a two - way locc protocol with @xmath1-round classical communication has @xmath2 steps . for example , in the case of two - round classical communication ,",
    "the total protocol is given as follows when the initial operation is done by alice : alice performs her operation with her measurement and sends her outcome to bob .",
    "bob receives alice s outcome , performs his operation with his measurement , and sends his outcome to alice .",
    "alice then receives bob s outcome and performs her measurement .    to consider the relation between accessible information and these kinds of restrictions on the operations ,",
    "state discrimination with locc restriction for our measurement @xcite has been widely studied . in this paper , we focus on hypothesis testing ( state discrimination with asymmetric treatment of errors ) of a pair of quantum states . when our operations are limited to one - way locc operations or two - way locc operations , hypothesis testing is called local hypothesis testing .",
    "if we do not impose any constraint on our measurement , a general asymptotic theory can be established even for the quantum case when multiple copies of the unknown states are available .",
    "for example , hiai et al .",
    "@xcite and ogawa et al .",
    "@xcite derived the quantum version of stein s bound @xcite , i.e. , the optimal exponent of the type-2 error under the constant constraint for the type-1 error .",

    "@xcite and nussbaum et al .",
    "@xcite derived the quantum version of the chernoff bound @xcite , i.e. , the optimal exponent of the sum of the type-1 and type-2 errors .",
    "other papers @xcite derived the quantum version of the hoeffding bound @xcite , which is the optimal exponent of the type-2 error under the exponential constraint for the type-1 error and can be considered to be a generalization of the chernoff bound . however , when we impose the one - way or two - way locc constraint on our measurement , these problems become very difficult , and they have not been solved completely . in particular , it is quite difficult to solve these problems for an arbitrary fixed pair of quantum states . in the following ,",
    "we mainly address hoeffding bounds and will hardly mention about the chernoff bounds .",
    "this treatment does not lose the generality because our results about the hoeffding bounds includes the results bound the chernoff bounds as special cases .    to avoid the difficulty caused by generality , this paper discusses the problem of distinguishing an arbitrary fixed pure entangled state @xmath0 from the white noise state , i.e. , the completely mixed state .",
    "in the non - asymptotic setting , our previous paper @xcite addressed the problem under the constraint that @xmath0 is detected with probability @xmath3 .",
    "our more recent paper @xcite addressed it in a more general setting .",
    "in particular , that paper @xcite proposed concrete two - round classical communication two - way locc protocols that are not reduced to one - way locc . then , we extended the problem to the case when the entangled state is given as the @xmath4-copy state of a certain entangled state @xcite .",
    "as asymptotic results , we showed that there is no difference between one - way and two - way locc for stein s bound , i.e. , the optimal exponent of the type-2 error under the constant constraint for the type-1 error . to make an upperbound of the optimal performance of the two - way locc case ,",
    "our papers @xcite also considered the performance in the case of separable operations , which can be easily treated because of their mathematically simple forms .",
    "the class of separable operations includes locc , but there exist separable operations which are not locc @xcite .",
    "however , our previous paper @xcite did not derive the hoeffding bound for two - way locc , i.e. , the optimal exponent of the type-2 error under the exponential constraint for the type-1 error , while it derived it for one - way locc .",
    "further , even under the constant constraint for the type-1 error , the paper did not consider the higher order of the decreasing rate of the type-2 error . indeed , in information theory , strassen @xcite derived the decreasing rate of the type-2 error up to the third - order @xmath5 under the same constraint in the classical setting when @xmath4 is the number of available copies .",
    "tomamichel et al @xcite and li @xcite extended this result up to the second order @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the hoeffding bound for two - way locc and the optimal decreasing rate of the type-2 error under the constant constraint for the type-1 error up to the third - order @xmath5 for one - way and two - way locc .",
    "we also derive them for separable measurements .",
    "the obtained results are summarized as follows .",
    "( 1 ) : :    there is a difference in the hoeffding bound between the one - way and    two - way locc constraints unless the entangled state    @xmath0 is maximally entangled . ( 2 ) : :    there is no difference in the hoeffding bound between two - way locc and    separable constraints . ( 3 ) : :    the optimal decreasing rate of the type-2 error under the constant    constraint for the type-1 error has no difference between the one - way    and two - way locc constraints up to the second order    @xmath6 . ( 4 ) : :    the optimal decreasing rate of the type-2 error under the constant    constraint for the type-1 error has a difference between the one - way    and two - way locc constraints in the third order @xmath7    unless the entangled state @xmath0 is maximally    entangled . ( 5 ) : :    the optimal decreasing rate of the type-2 error under the constant    constraint for the type-1 error is not different between the two - way    locc and separable constraints up to the third order    @xmath8 . ( 6 ) : :    the three - step two - way locc protocol proposed in @xcite can achieve    the hoeffding bound for two - way locc . ( 7 ) : :    the three - step two - way locc protocol proposed in @xcite can achieve    the optimal decreasing rate of the type-2 error under the constant    constraint for the type-1 error up to the third - order    @xmath5 for two - way locc .",
    "finally , we discuss our result from the mathematical point of view .",
    "the difficulty of the above results can be classified into two parts .",
    "one is the asymptotic evaluation of optimal performance of separable operations .",
    "the other is the asymptotic evaluation of optimal performance of the three - step two - way locc protocol proposed in @xcite .",
    "usually , to evaluate the exponential decreasing rate , we employ large deviation theory , e.g. , cramr theorem .",
    "however , to evaluate the exponential decreasing rates in the former case , we need more detailed analysis . hence",
    ", we employ the strong large deviation initiated by bhadur - rao @xcite , which enables us to analyze the tail probability up to the constant order of exponentially small probability .",
    "( see proposition [ 11 - 4 - 4 ] in appendix . ) indeed , although bhadur - rao @xcite obtained such detailed evaluation for the tail probability in 1960 , they were rarely applied to information theoretical topics .",
    "that is , our analysis is a good application of the strong large deviation . on the other hand , to evaluate the exponential decreasing rates in the latter case , we employ the type method @xcite , the saddle point approximation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec preliminary ] , we summarize the known results for simple hypothesis testing and explain the main results by preparing the mathematical descriptions of our hypothesis testing problem",
    ". then , we derive the analytical expressions of the optimal error exponents under one - way locc povms in section [ sec one - way ] .",
    "next , in section [ sec separable ] , we derive the analytical expressions of the optimal error exponents under separable locc povms . for this derivation",

    "our notation is the same as in our previous paper @xcite .",

    "we firstly discuss hypothesis testing in a general quantum system @xmath9 and its @xmath4-copies extension . in quantum hypothesis testing , we consider two hypotheses , the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis .",
    "when a hypothesis consists of one element , it is called simple . otherwise , it is called composite .",

    "when the measurement outcome corresponds to @xmath15 , we judge an unknown state as @xmath14 , and when the measurement outcome is @xmath16 , we judge it as @xmath13 .    thus , type-1 error is written as @xmath19 and type-2 error is written as @xmath20 the optimal type-2 error under the condition that the type-1 error is no more than a constant @xmath21 is written as @xmath22    now , we give the asymptotic properties of @xmath23 . for this purpose ,",
