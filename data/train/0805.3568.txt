    "a dynamical mechanism for the process @xmath2 is proposed that allows for the extraction of the tensor charge from experiment .",
    "the basis for this approach is in the relation between a hadronic description of the process , in terms of regge poles and cuts , and the partonic description , in terms of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite .",
    "the latter provides a formal connection to the transversity distribution of the nucleon , @xmath3 , and the helicity amplitudes that are key to parameterizing the hadronic description . in the following",
    "we will use this connection as a guide in exploring the observables that isolate the transversity .",
    "the two models , gpd ( fig.[fig1]a ) and regge ( fig.[fig1]b ) , will illustrate how the extraction of transversity and the tensor charge can proceed experimentally . a key point in our approach",
    "is that deeply virtual @xmath0 ( as well as @xmath4 ) production off a proton target is clearly distinct from the other types of meson production processes in that it involves the transition of a ( virtual ) photon with @xmath5 to a @xmath6 state ( _ i.e. _ the final @xmath0 or @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) requiring odd @xmath9parity and chiral odd t - channel quantum numbers . as a consequence , in a partonic description such as the one depicted in fig.[fig1]a , the `` outgoing '' and `` returning '' quark helicities need to be opposite to one another .",
    "a similar picture can be obtained in the regge model as dictated by duality .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 electroproduction off a proton single out chiral - odd structures of the target .",
    "another important consequence is that the collinear , leading twist @xmath10 type contribution to the @xmath0 wave function does not have the correct chirality for the electroproduction process .",
    "consideration of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) in the wave function allowed us however to overcome this problem , as we will explain below .",
    "gpds are `` off - forward '' contributions , that allow access to partonic configurations with a given longitudinal momentum fraction , similarly to deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes , but also at a specific ( transverse ) location inside the hadron @xcite .",
    "they parameterize the nucleon vertex in the process depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a in terms of three kinematical invariants , besides the initial photon s virtuality , @xmath11 : the longitudinal momentum transfer , @xmath12 , the four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath13 , and the variable @xmath14 , representing the light cone ( lc ) momentum fraction carried by the struck parton with momentum @xmath15 ( see @xcite ) for reviews ) .",
    "as initially pointed out in ref.@xcite one can construct four quark helicity flip distributions : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , representing a complete set .",
    "in particular @xmath16 , which need not vanish in the forward limit , is related to transversity through the following properties : @xmath20 the form factor @xmath21 gives the tensor charge for @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the transversity structure function  @xcite .",
    "eqs.([transversity_def ] ) and ( [ transv_forward ] ) are analogous relations to the ones for the twist two , chiral - even , unpolarized and longitudinally polarized distributions cases .",
    "a substantial amount of literature exists on the connection between transverse momentum distributions ( tmds ) and gpds @xcite .",
    "tmds are the soft matrix elements in deep inelastic semi - inclusive processes and therefore they are by definition forward quantities .",
    "the non - trivial role played by initial state interactions ( isi ) and final state interactions ( fsi ) allows one however to access features of the motion of partons in the transverse direction . in particular , in ref.@xcite",
    "it was proposed that the transverse momentum asymmetry of the final quarks  generating the sivers function  can be related to the transverse spatial asymmetry , through a chromodynamic lensing effect . notwithstanding",
    "the appeal of the physical ideas connecting transversity and transverse spatial structure of hadrons , one should notice that the transverse spatial dependence appearing in @xcite is , however , necessarily buried in the correlators expressions defining tmds , and it can only be probed explicitly through exclusive measurements .",
    "the concrete possibility of testing the ideas on the role of transversity other than in semi - inclusive measurements , that are not directly sensitive to ( transverse ) spatial degrees of freedom , has been so far elusive .",
    "suggestions were in fact made to obtain such information mainly from lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "the main thrust of this paper is on the contrary to propose a new avenue to experimentally determine transversity and its connection to spatial degrees of freedom , using exclusive processes such as @xmath0 and @xmath7 production off nucleons and nuclei . in this context",
    "two other functions , namely the combination of gpds @xmath25 , and the gpd @xmath26 defining the spin flip component in scattering from an unpolarized nucleon , are essential .",
    "@xmath27 is expected , in a class of models ( @xcite and references therein ) , to be related to the boer - mulders function , @xmath28 through :    @xmath29_{\\zeta = t=0 }   = \\kappa_t^q \\\\",
    "\\int d^2 k_t \\ , dx h_{1}^{\\perp \\ , q}(x , k_t ) \\approx   - \\kappa_t^q \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similarly , @xmath26 , can be related to the sivers function , @xmath30 :    @xmath31_{\\zeta = t=0 } = \\kappa^q \\\\ \\int d^2 k_t \\ , dx f_{1t}^{\\perp \\ , q}(x , k_t ) \\approx - \\kappa^q   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath32 is the contribution to the proton anomalous magnetic moment of the quark @xmath33 . in the transverse plane in coordinate space , @xmath32 is a measure of an unpolarized quark s displacement along the @xmath34-axis in a proton polarized along the @xmath35-axis @xcite .",
    "@xmath36 , the transverse anomalous moment , measures the @xmath34-transverse displacement for a transversely polarized quark along the @xmath35-axis in an unpolarized proton @xcite .",
    "the relationships above express at a deeper level the fact that both pairs : @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 $ ] , have the same helicity structure . and @xmath39 are the unintegrated over @xmath40 gpds . ]",
    "they can therefore be obtained from the overlap of similar wave functions at the handbag level .",
    "nevertheless , upon integration in @xmath40 , @xmath26 does not necessarily vanish , while @xmath30 , because of it is @xmath41-odd , is non zero only if fsi is taken into account .",
    "this is the reason why in the literature @xcite no direct relationship was written explicitly .    in order to make a connection with observables for given processes one needs to transform the dirac matrix elements in terms of which",
    "the defining quark correlation functions are written , to the quark chirality basis @xcite .",
    "one can see that @xmath42 appears in the off - forward helicity amplitude @xmath43 @xcite while @xmath44 is defined in @xmath45 ( more details are given below ) .",
    ", where @xmath46 are the initial ( final ) proton helicities , and @xmath47 are the initial ( final ) quark helicities ] as known from the helicity amplitude decomposition of observables in @xmath48 photoproduction  @xcite , measurements of either the polarized target asymmetry , @xmath49 , or the recoil nucleon polarization , @xmath41 , or polarized photon asymmetries , @xmath50 on nucleons can be used to determine the desired helicity structure which we will see is connected to the off - forward quark helicity amplitudes ( and related gpds ) .",
    "a particular model was developed in ref.@xcite that , by accounting for the regge cut corrections to the pole dominated amplitude , predicted non - negligible values of @xmath49 , @xmath41 and @xmath50 in the range @xmath51 gev@xmath52 .",
    "the model contains the nucleons tensor charges as parameters  or a combination of parameters . by extending this model to the case of virtual photon scattering ( fig.[fig1]b ) , one can",
    ", therefore , extract the value of the tensor charge directly from the data using both the ideal intermediate energy kinematical range accessible at compass , hermes and jefferson lab , and the high precision provided by the latter . from the parton perspective",
    ", recent developments @xcite enable us to propose a detailed model where the quark degrees of freedom are described in terms of chiral - odd gpds .",
    "the connections being explored here , among transversity distributions , regge exchange models and gpds had some early hints from an exchange model that was developed for the tensor charge  @xcite . there",
    "the isovector and isoscalar components of the tensor charge were shown to be proportional to the product of the matrix elements for the decay of the lightest axial vector mesons ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath54 and @xmath3 respectively , and for the coupling of these mesons to the nucleon ( fig.[fig1]b ) . both of them are needed in order to determine the isovector and isoscalar components of the tensor charge .",
    "their coupling constants that entered the calculation were determined through the better known decay constant of the @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) meson , by exploiting the fact that @xmath55 belongs to the same @xmath57 multiplet as @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) type exchanges do not enter directly the @xmath59 scattering amplitude .",
    "this will bear important consequences also in the description in terms of gpds , namely in the identification of the correct structures entering the different helicity amplitudes .    in the single meson or axial vector dominance approximation of ref.@xcite , angular momentum conservation at point - like interaction vertices required that the coupling vanish in the forward limit . in order for",
    "the tensor charge not to vanish , a duality picture was envisaged where the struck quark undergoes final state interactions ( fsi ) whose effect is parametrized in @xcite in terms of the meson s constituent quarks @xmath60 .",
    "this interesting point of departure from other treatments is the appearance of the factor @xmath61 in the expression for the tensor charge @xmath62 .",
    "this arises because of the kinematic structure of the exchange picture that was adopted .",
    "the approach to the tensor charge just summarized leaves several questions - two in particular .",
    "is the extrapolation from the @xmath54 mass ( @xmath63 ) to @xmath64 a reasonable one ? can fsi s enter the picture in a natural way to parallel the @xmath65 dependence that was needed ? both of these questions are answered affirmatively in a regge exchange model for @xmath48 electroproduction .",
    "the @xmath54 regge trajectory enables the extrapolation to the @xmath66 region .",
    "regge cuts restore the exchange amplitude in the forward limit , as shown in photoproduction analyses in the past  @xcite .",
    "the gpd , or off - forward amplitude approach also provides answers to these questions .",
    "gpds are functions of off - forward two body kinematic invariants , including @xmath67 , and allow for smooth extrapolation to @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , the relevant off - forward helicity amplitude need not vanish in the forward limit , as will be seen later .",
    "a central question of factorization arises in relating the @xmath48 electroproduction single spin asymmetries to the relevant gpds , because the important helicity amplitudes involve transverse virtual photons .",
    "factorization in meson production was explained in ref.@xcite for longitudinally polarized photons only , based on the fact that in this case the end - point effects from the wave function of the produced meson are suppressed with respect to the transverse case @xcite .",
    "this point of view was reiterated in several papers  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "gpd factorization was criticized recently by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite where it was claimed that the dominance of regge type exchanges produces non - analytic terms that destroy factorization .",
    "this is an ongoing and important debate now underway .",
    "since our starting point is a `` duality '' type of picture , we think that there is theoretical merit in both perspectives .    on the experimental front",
    ", however , there seems to be little evidence in the data that one can rule out transverse vs. longitudinal factorization hypothesis .",
    "this appears in the @xmath11 dependence of the recent hermes @xmath68 production data showing a plateau in @xmath69 for vector meson production @xcite ( intermediate energy ) , @xcite ( high energy ) .",
    "we propose a new mechanism to describe the @xmath11 dependence at the meson vertex that distinguishes the longitudinal and transverse photon polarization contributions .",
    "this mechanism describes both the vector ( natural parity ) and axial vector ( unnatural parity ) channels taking into account the orbital angular momentum in the evaluation of the different quark helicity contributions to the pion wave function .",
    "in particular , the axial vector and vector channel differ by one unit of orbital angular momentum .",
    "hence , as explained in detail later on , the longitudinal photon amplitude is dominated by the axial vector contributions . for",
    "the transverse photon both vector and axial vector channels will contribute .",
    "our results , differing from perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) type behavior , provide a less steep dependence on @xmath11 of the longitudinal to transverse ratios .",
    "we would like to remark that independent of the way corrections to the standard pqcd approach are carried out , and of the interest in the process @xmath70 as a probe of transversity , the issue of carefuly monitoring @xmath48 electroproduction at intermediate energies will be a prominent one in the analysis of many planned experiments at both compass and jlab .",
    "@xmath48 s constitute , in fact , a large background in @xmath71 production from both protons and nuclei . finally , we suggest a practical method to extract both the tensor charge , @xmath62 , and the transverse anomalous moment , @xmath72 , from experiment that makes use of the fact that such quantities enter as free parameters in both our regge and partonic descriptions .",
    "we suggest a number of observables , _ e.g. _ the longitudinal / transverse interference term , @xmath73 , the transverse spin asymmetry , @xmath74 , the beam spin polarization , that are sensitive to the values of @xmath62 and @xmath72 , @xmath75 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec-2 ] we present definitions and kinematics ; in section [ sec-3 ] we present our regge approach ; in section [ sec-4 ] we introduce the connection to gpds and we develop a parametrization of the chiral - odd ones , based on available experimental and phenomenological information ; in section [ sec-5 ] we propose a model of the @xmath11 dependence of the various helicity amplitudes ; in section [ sec-6 ] we discuss results and propose an extraction method for the tensor charge ; finally in section [ sec-7 ] we draw our conclusions and present an outlook .",
    "the spirit of the paper is to suggest a method to obtain @xmath62 and @xmath36 from experiment , while exploring a number of questions : from the dominance of chiral - odd contributions in @xmath0 electroproduction , to the duality picture , and the transition from regge to partonic contributions .",
    "in the following discussion of exclusive @xmath48 electroproduction , the crucial nexus connecting observable quantities , transversity gpds and the regge description is provided by helicity amplitudes . the relation between the electroproduction , virtual photon helicity amplitudes , @xmath76 and the relevant gpds",
    "is expressed in the `` handbag '' picture , with the assumption that the  hard part factorizes from the `` soft part '' , as shown in fig .",
    "while this has been shown for the case of a high @xmath11 longitudinal photon in exclusive vector meson electroproduction , it has not been demonstrated for transverse photons in @xmath48 production .",
    "the transverse photon contribution is kinematically suppressed by @xmath77 relative to the longitudinal photon from the lepton tensor and the hand convention for the virtual longitudinal photon flux .",
    "it has been presumed by many authors , without proof , that the transverse case does not factorize .",
    "several papers have been written to carry the longitudinal case to higher twist , speculating that factorization still holds , while ignoring the transverse case , which should enter at the same order of @xmath77 as twist 3 for longitudinal photons .",
    "furthermore , the transverse virtual photon cross section does not show evidence of a decreasing ratio of transverse to longitudinal , as seen at hermes  @xcite and in preliminary data from jlab  @xcite , which leads us to reconsider the transverse case and to assume that factorization does hold .",
    "we therefore start out by defining the helicity amplitudes and the main observables related to transversity within the assumption of factorization for the partonic description .",
    "it is important to recall that in the regge pole or single particle exchange picture there is factorization of the upper vertex ( @xmath78 ) from the lower vertex ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "this factorization would correspond to the @xmath67-channel picture ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) in which the quark and antiquark exchanges are accompanied by ladder - like gluon links .",
    "the regge pole coupling at the vertex is independent of the other vertex and satisfies parity conservation .",
    "exclusive @xmath48 electroproduction is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the relevant four - momenta written in the laboratory frame are the initial ( final ) electrons : @xmath80 , the exchanged photon s : @xmath81 , with @xmath82 , and @xmath83 ; the initial proton , @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , one has the final proton @xmath85 , and the final pion @xmath86 .",
    "we define the usual invariants for a deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) process : the virtual photon s four - momentum squared , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the mandelstam invariants are defined with respect to the @xmath91 process , namely : @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the amplitudes are decomposed into a purely leptonic part and the @xmath95 process for which there are six independent helicity amplitudes chosen as @xmath96 for transverse photons and @xmath97 for longitudinal photons .",
    "we use the notation : @xmath98 , @xmath99 being the virtual photon spin , and @xmath100 being the initial ( final ) nucleon spins ; here @xmath101 is the magnitude of the three - momentum transfer , and the minimum kinematically allowed power is indicated for each helicity amplitude . in a single hadron exchange ( or regge pole exchange ) factorization and parity conservation require @xmath102 for even or odd parity exchanges , to leading order in @xmath103 .",
    "these pair relations , along with a single hadron exchange model , force @xmath104 to behave like @xmath105 for small @xmath106 or small transverse momentum for the outgoing particles .",
    "this introduces the @xmath107 factor into the @xmath104 amplitude , which is related to the transversity transfer , as we will see below from its connection with the gpd @xmath108 .",
    "observable quantities are bilinear combinations of these helicity amplitudes .",
    "the differential cross section for pion electroproduction off an unpolarized target is @xcite @xmath109 if the initial electron is polarized , with @xmath110 , one has the additional contribution @xmath111 the photon polarization parameter @xmath112 can be written in terms of invariants as    @xmath113    and for longitudinal polarization alone ,    @xmath114    the factor @xmath115 is given by @xmath116    where the mott cross section is @xmath117    and the hadronic recoil factor , @xmath118 ,    @xmath119    in eq.([gamma ] ) , @xmath120 is the jacobian for the transformation from @xmath121 to @xmath67 , whose expression is given in appendix [ app-1 ] .",

    "we give the transversely polarized target asymmetry , @xmath130 and the beam spin asymmetry , @xmath131 where @xmath132 ( note that the recoil nucleon polarization asymmetry , @xmath133 , defined analogously to @xmath74 simply involves the switching of @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) .    it is important to realize that the relations between observables and helicity amplitudes are general , independent of any particular model .",
    "we will see that the regge model , as well as the parameterization through gpds , populate those helicity amplitudes related to transversity and thereby effect observables in important ways .",
    "the connection with the parton model and the transversity distribution is uncovered through the gpd decomposition of the helicity amplitudes . in the factorization scenario",
    "the amplitudes for exclusive @xmath48 electroproduction , @xmath98 can be decomposed into a `` hard part '' , @xmath136 describing the partonic subprocess @xmath137 ( top part of diagram in fig[fig1]a ) , and a `` soft part '' , @xmath138 that , in turn , contains the gpds , @xmath139 where a sum over the different quark components is omitted for simplicity .",
    "the amplitudes in eq.([facto ] ) implicitly contain an integration over the unobserved quark momenta , and are functions of @xmath140 and @xmath11 ; they are analogous to the compton form factors in dvcs .",
    "in fact , in the more familiar case of dvcs , the upper part involves the matrix elements of @xmath141 , the tree level diagram for @xmath142 with the high momentum struck quark intermediate state . in the bjorken limit , in terms of light cone variables ,",
    "this diagram has a simple dirac structure of @xmath143 with a denominator that becomes @xmath144 ( the corresponding crossed diagram , required for gauge invariance , yields @xmath145 ) .",
    "the same structure would obtain for the production of vector mesons ",

    "one model for this , that is often used , has the hadronic wave function nicely factored from the partonic components of the pqcd diagrams . with this latter approach",
    "there is a depression of longitudinal to / from transverse transitions  @xcite . for pion production the upper , hard part of the diagram involves the matrix element between quark states of @xmath147 , the latter being the pseudoscalar hadronic current operator .",
    "as we have emphasized , for @xmath48 the diagram is c - parity odd and chiral odd in the @xmath148channel . because only one of these transverse photon functions survives the limits , the relation to the tensor charge is quite simple .",
    "note that because of the pion chirality ( 0@xmath149 ) , the quark must flip helicity at the pion vertex where we take the coupling to be @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding dirac structure for the hard subprocess diagram involves @xmath151 , at variance with refs.@xcite where the c - parity even axial vector structure @xmath152 was considered .",
    "this is very significant for our reaction .",

    "we will construct a regge pole model with cuts to account for measured photoproduction observables at moderate s and small t , and extend the model into electroproduction for moderate @xmath11 .",
    "we now employ a regge pole description of the @xmath48 electroproduction , following the `` weak cut '' approach used by goldstein and owens @xcite where all the observable quantities are defined in terms of the @xmath165 amplitudes , as related above . from @xcite one",

    "the leading regge trajectories that are exchanged in this or any two - body diffractive process can be categorized by the signature and parity .",
    "the signature determines whether the poles in the exchange amplitudes will occur for even or odd positive integer values of the spin trajectory @xmath189 .",
    "the leading axial vectors are @xmath54 and @xmath3 .",
    "these are crucial for determining the tensor charge and the transversity distribution .",

    "the vector meson trajectories do not couple to the helicity zero photon and pion vertex .",
    "clearly all of these amplitudes vanish in the forward direction , as a result of the factorization of the regge pole exchanges into two vertices and the fact that parity conservation holds separately for both vertices .",
    "this implies that @xmath104 , which , in general has the minimal angular dependence of @xmath196 , for the regge pole contributions alone , acquires the same angular dependence as @xmath105 . since the @xmath197 limit is quite important for the identification with transversity through @xmath198 and thus through the gpd @xmath108 , it behooves us to consider the rescattering or fsi in this picture .",
    "this leads to the regge cut scheme for rescattering corrections , which was quite important for making contact with spin dependent data .    the regge cut scheme is implemented by first taking the impact parameter representation of the pole terms as an eikonal , @xmath199 with @xmath200 being the helicity change .",
    "next convoluting with the eikonal obtained from helicity conserving pomeron exchange , @xmath201 and then transforming back to the momentum space representation @xmath202 this restores the @xmath196 behavior of @xmath104 , thereby providing a non - zero tensor charge through the regge couplings .",

    "however , because , of the proportionality of the helicity amplitudes of @xmath134 and @xmath105 to @xmath343 and @xmath344 , respectively , as @xmath67 approaches @xmath175 , the amplitude @xmath104 , measuring the tensor charge is the main contribution at low @xmath67 .",
    "this is consistent with the approximations used in our gpd model , and our proposed extractions are indeed valid at @xmath345 where the gpd - based description of the electroproduction cross sections applies .    on the other hand , in @xmath341 ,",
    "a cancellation occurs of the @xmath346 term , eq.([dsigltp ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath341 is only the dependent on the gpd , @xmath347 , allowing one in principle to measure the sensitivity to @xmath333 .",
    "again , in the regge model the above cancellation is only partial because of a more complicated interplay between the natural and unnatural parity exchanges .",
    "however we observe a similar trend showing the suppression of the tensor charge dependent term .",
    "we are therefore able to single out the observables @xmath74 and @xmath341 as probes of the tensor charge and of @xmath333 .",
    "results for the asymmetries are shown in figures [ fig6 ] , [ fig7],[fig8],[fig9 ] .",
    "@xmath74 , eq.([aut ] ) , and @xmath348 , eq.([alpha ] ) , are given as a function of @xmath67 in figs.[fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , respectively .",
    "in fig.[fig6 ] we compare the regge and gpd models . for the regge",
    "we show separately the contributions of the combination of helicity amplitudes including the tensor charge , and the ones sensitive to @xmath333 , together with the total contribution .",
    "more specifically we separate out the terms proportional to @xmath342 and @xmath349 , respectively .",
    "the latter , given by the dot - dashed curve , clearly dominates the asymmetry at low @xmath67 . the gpd model is instead governed entirely by the tensor charge term .",
    "a similar picture is obtained for @xmath348 , shown in fig.[fig7 ] , by inverting the role of the tensor charge and @xmath350 terms . however , here the only surviving term in our gpd model is @xmath351 , which is very small due to the smallness of the helicity amplitude @xmath105 .",
    "the regge model gives larger contributions for @xmath105 .",
    "these are shown at different recently measured kinematics .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath74 in the gpd model to the values of the u - quark and d - quark tensor charges , is shown in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "the values in the figure were taken by varying up to @xmath352 the values of the tensor charge extracted from the global analysis of ref . , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath353 and @xmath354 , keeping the transverse anomalous magnetic moment values , @xmath355 and @xmath356 .",
    "fig.[fig8 ] is one of the main results of this paper : it summarizes our proposed method for extracting the tensor charge from @xmath0 electroproduction experiments .",
    "a practical extraction of the tensor charge can be obtained by noticing that for the asymmetry , as well as for other quantities evaluated in this paper such as @xmath357 , and @xmath358 the tensor charges for the different isospin components might be treated as parameters related to the normalization of @xmath108 ( @xmath358 is plotted in fig.[fig9 ] ) .",
    "therefore our model can be used to constrain the range of values allowed by the data .    in fig.[fig10 ]",
    "we show the sensitivity of @xmath74 to the tensor charge values at fixed @xmath359 gev@xmath52 , and as a function of @xmath281 . as in the previous figures we took @xmath360 and @xmath337 .",
    "we performed calculations for a range of values of @xmath11 .",
    "we find that the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath74 is rather small due to the cancellations of the form factors in the ratio ( eq.([aut ] ) ) . on the contrary , as can be seen from fig.[fig11 ] for _ e.g. _ @xmath361 , the single contributions to the cross section expectedly display a steep @xmath11 dependence .",
    "notice that the electroproduction data are essential in determining the tensor charge and other transversity related quantities .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig12 ] where we show the photoproduction cross section calculated following the model in @xcite .",
    "the value of the tensor charge is extracted in this case from the the regge residue of the axial vector contribution to the helicity amplitude @xmath104 ( see section [ sec-3 ] ) at @xmath22 .",
    "this is plotted in the lower panel of fig.[fig12 ] where the central value extracted by fitting the model parameters to the photoproduction data is shown along with curves corresponding to a @xmath362 variation of the tensor charge ( labeled correspondingly in the figure ) . from the figure it is clear that the photoproduction cross section is very little affected by variations in the values of the tensor charge , except very near forward .",
    "the @xmath11 dependence of our model is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] .",
    "fig.[fig13 ] shows the different form factors describing the upper vertex in fig.[fig1]b , for the different helicity amplitudes , namely @xmath363 , @xmath364 , @xmath365 , and @xmath366 , where @xmath367 and @xmath368 are a short notation for the vector and axial transition form factors,@xmath369 , and @xmath370 introduced in section [ sec-5 ] .",
    "all form factors were calculated using the approach described in section [ sec-5 ] .",
    "the axial form factor displays a steeper @xmath11 dependence at large @xmath11 , due to the difference in orbital angular momentum between the initial and final hadronic states . in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] we show the impact of multiplying the different helicity amplitudes by different form factors on some of the observables which are governed by either longitudinal or transverse photon polarization .",
    "results are shown at @xmath371 for two different values of @xmath67 , @xmath359 gev@xmath52 and @xmath372 gev@xmath52 , in the gpd model . despite the fact that the @xmath67 dependence plays an important role , as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig3],[fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , we expect the longitudinal to transverse ratios , @xmath373 , and @xmath374 , to have a less steep @xmath11 dependence than the one based on simple pqcd predictions .",
    "the shape of the curves is a consequence of the difference in the @xmath11 behavior for the axial and vector form factors , whose ratio displays a @xmath375 dependence .",
    "these however enter the cross section in different linear combinations , and with different weights depending on the values of @xmath67 , giving rise to the curves shown in the figure .",
    "it should be noticed that this is qualitatively different from taking different monopole masses for axial vector and vector meson form factors , and assuming the same @xmath11 behavior @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we presented a framework for analyzing @xmath0 exclusive electroproduction where , by observing that this reaction proceeds through c - parity odd and chiral odd combinations of t - channel exchange quantum numbers , it can be selected to obtain direct measurements of the meson production form factors for the chiral odd generalized parton distributions .",
    "this is at variance with deeply virtual compton scattering , and with both vector meson and charged @xmath1 electroproduction , where the axial charge corresponding to c - parity even exchanges can enter the amplitudes .",
    "we then studied the different terms appearing in the cross section for scattering from an unpolarized proton , including the beam polarization asymmetry using the helicity amplitudes formalism .",
    "a regge based description based on the `` weak cut '' approach was adopted where the leading axial vectors exchanges , @xmath54 and @xmath3 , determine the tensor charge and the transversity distribution , while the leading vector exchanges , @xmath68 and @xmath190 can be related to the transverse anomalous moment .    the partonic description , singling out the chiral odd gpds ,",
    "was implemented to show the sensitivity of some of the observables , in particular the interference terms in the unpolarized cross section to the values of the @xmath376 and @xmath377 quark tensor charges , as well as to the values of the @xmath376 and @xmath377 quark transverse anomalous moments .",
    "predictions were also given for the transverse target spin asymmetry , @xmath74 .",
    "the various correspondences between the regge approach and the gpd models were highlighted .",
    "this aspect of the of analysis represents an avenue that we will continue to pursue in the near future .",
    "finally , we expect a variety of new flavor sensitive observables to be extracted from the data in the near future using both unpolarized data and asymmetries from transversely polarized proton and deuteron data on @xmath0 and @xmath7 production at the higher @xmath103 values attainable at jefferson lab at 12 gev .",
