    "our investigation is motivated by the assumption that the high packing fraction behaviour of repulsive deformable spheres is determined by two critical conditions : a ) the glass transition at which the particles become so densely packed that the diffusion of the particles past their nearest neighbours becomes highly improbable on an experimental time scale and b ) the jamming transition at which the particles are jammed together , forming a network of direct contacts . that both transitions may be significant can be inferred from the combined datasets obtained by respectively meeker _ et al . _",

    ", we therefore expect three states for a deformable sphere : at @xmath20 the system behaves like a supercooled fluid , at @xmath16 the system is in a glassy state , at @xmath17 the system is in a squeezed state .",
    "in this paper we present our work on the dynamics of thermosensitive microgels , as an example of deformable spheres , and we show that these three states are characterised by a distinct behaviour of dynamical heterogeneity . more precisely , spatial correlations of the dynamics are relatively short - ranged and of small amplitude in the supercooled state , grow dramatically in the glassy state , where they span the whole system , and finally become more localized , but of large amplitude , in the squeezed state .",
    "we use aqueous solutions of poly - n - isopropylacrylamide ( pnipam ) microgels , which exhibit a lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) at @xmath21 ( senff & richtering 1999 ) . below the lcst ,",
    "the dimensions of our pnipam microgels exhibit a remarkable sensitivity to temperature , which enables us to vary the volume fraction of a given system by a factor of 1.7 by varying the temperature from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "though very convenient for the study of the high volume fraction behaviour , working with microgel solutions calls for some caution , if the aim is to compare their behaviour to other soft sphere systems like foams and emulsions .",
    "indeed , microgel solutions are solutions and not dispersions ; they are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the solvent and do not possess a well defined interface .",
    "they thus can partly interpenetrate and/or compress under their own osmotic pressure . despite this enhanced difficulty ,",
    "their unique temperature sensitivity bears two main advantages : the volume fraction can be varied by changing the temperature and , more importantly , the sample history can be controlled uniquely by temperature , with no need to apply a preshear to the sample , as is typically required by colloidal systems .",
    "indeed , the study of the dynamics of highly concentrated systems , in particular of glassy and squeezed systems , can tremendously suffer from an ill - controlled history of the sample .",
    "the thermosensitive microgel systems offer the unique advantage to allow for the preparation of the system in a fluid - like state at low volume fraction ( high temperature ) , which is subsequently quenched to the solid - like states by inflating the particle ( decreasing the temperature ) , so as to obtain a higher volume fraction .",
    "this protocol is not only convenient to use in almost any experimental set - up , it is to a certain extent more meaningful than the application of a high shear stress or rate , which is generally used to erase the sample history ( cloitre _ et al . _ 2000 ; rogers _ et al .",
    "indeed , the application of shear imposes a directional deformation to the system , while the isotropic inflation of the particles results in randomly oriented stresses i.e. strains .",

    "this stock solution is then used to produce more dilute samples .",
    "the actual concentration of the stock is determined by drying a defined solution volume and determining the residual amount of microgels to obtain both a concentration in weight% and a concentration in g / ml , where the latter is defined relative to the solution volume at a room temperature of @xmath25 . due to the use of an ionic initiator , our microgels are charged . to screen these charges ,",

    "increasing the temperature leads to a gradual decrease of the particle size up to @xmath29 , where we find that the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic radius @xmath30 and the radius of gyration @xmath31 is well approximated by a critical - like function of form @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting fit parameters for @xmath30 are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ; for @xmath31 , we find @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . in agreement with previous investigations on similar pnipam - microgels ,",
    "the hydrodynamic radius is significantly larger than the radius of gyration for @xmath39 ( senff & richtering 2000 ; clara rahola 2007 ) .",
    "this is due to the uneven distribution of cross - linkers , the cross - linking density being larger in the centre of the microgels than on the edges ( mason & lin 2005 ) .",
    "because of the higher density of the core , the core scatters significantly more than the lower density edges , such that we essentially measure the radius of the highly cross - linked core in static light scattering , while we capture the hydrodynamically effective radius of the particle in dynamic light scattering . as the temperature approaches the critical solution temperature , the overall density of the microgel increases , such that @xmath30 approaches @xmath31 . beyond the lcst ,",

    "indeed , we generally would expect that @xmath207 becomes maximal when @xmath0 is maximal .",

    "the low shear viscosity appears to critically diverge at some nominal critical volume fraction @xmath101 , which we define as the transition from a ` supercooled ' to a ` glassy ' state .",
    "as the volume fraction of our microgel system is ill - defined , the indication in terms of nominal volume fractions does not allow for any conclusions with respect to the exact volume fraction at this transition .",
    "moreover , previous work has shown that the lower density shells of our microgels partly interpenetrate near @xmath101 ( clara - rahola 2007 ) , which adds to the difficulty in precisely assessing the fluid to solid transition observed at @xmath101 . the indication ` supercooled ' and ` glassy ' here refer to the inferred conditions that the microgels are able to escape out of a cage of nearest neighbours in the ` supercooled ' state , while this is not the case in the ` glassy ' state , where we additionally presume that the microgels do not exert direct contact forces on each other in the ` glassy ' state . despite the evident disadvantages in using microgels to investigate the fluid - solid transitions of repulsive systems , the advantage of varying the volume fraction by changing the temperature enables us to precisely control the history of our sample , which we believe prevails over the disadvantages .",
    "all our experiments are performed by first equilibrating the system in the fluid state at high temperature , which is then quenched to a given solid state by lowering the temperature .",

    "beyond @xmath101 the range of spatial correlations extends over the entire observational window .",
    "the mechanical properties are characterised by a low frequency elasticity ; the dissipative losses probed at high frequencies indicates that the local dynamics of the particles are still determined by the hydrodynamics of individual particles . increasing the volume fraction further , we identify a second transition , the transition to the ` squeezed ' states . in these states",
    "we find that the storage and dissipative contributions in the mechanical properties of the system become increasingly coupled and that the high frequency dissipative losses become significantly larger than the ones observed at lower @xmath65 .",
