    "the nonlinear differential equation @xmath1 appears in the modeling of certain phenomena in plasma physics @xcite . in  @xcite , mickens calculates the period of its periodic orbits and also uses the @xmath2-th order harmonic balance method ( hbm ) , for @xmath3 , to obtain approximations of these periodic solutions and of their corresponding periods . strictly speaking",
    ", it can be easily seen that neither equation  , nor its associated system @xmath4 which is singular at @xmath5 , have periodic solutions .",
    "our first result gives two different interpretations of mickens computation of the period .",
    "the first one in terms of weak ( or generalized ) solutions . in this work",
    "a weak solution will be a function satisfying the differential equation   on an open and dense set , but being of class @xmath6 at some isolated points .",
    "the second one , as the limit , when @xmath7 tends to zero , of the period of actual periodic solutions of the extended planar differential system @xmath8 which , for @xmath9 has a global center at the origin .",

    "@xmath14 then @xmath15 and @xmath16    recall that the @xmath2-th order hbm consists in approximating the solutions of differential equations by truncated fourier series with @xmath2 harmonics and an unknown frequency ; see for instance  @xcite or section  [ hbm ] for a short overview of the method . in  @xcite the author asks for techniques for dealing analytically with the @xmath2-th order hbm , for @xmath17 . in  @xcite it",

    "we utilize a more powerful tool , the computation of grbner basis ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) ) , for going further in the obtention of approximations of the function @xmath19 introduced in theorem  [ main1 ] .    notice that equation   is equivalent to the family of differential equations @xmath20 for any @xmath21 .",

    "whereby the sturm sequences approach can be used to get them with any desirable precision .",
    "notice that the values @xmath34 for @xmath35 given in items ( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( iv ) , respectively , are already computed in item ( i ) .",
    "we only explicite them to clarify the reading .",
    "observe that the comparison of with the value @xmath19 given in theorem  [ main1 ] shows that when @xmath36 the best approximations of @xmath19 happen when @xmath37 .",
    "for this reason we have applied the hbm for @xmath38 and @xmath39 to elucidate which of the approaches is better . in the table",
    "[ tperror ] we will compare the percentage of the relative errors @xmath40 the best approximation that we have found corresponds to @xmath41 our computers have had problems to get the grbner basis needed to fill the gaps of the table .",
    "[ ta1 ]    @xmath42    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "theorem  [ main1 ] is proved in section  [ solus ] . in section [ hbm ] we describe the @xmath2-th order hbm adapted to our purposes .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec sys ] we use this method to demonstrate theorem  [ main2 ] .",
    "@xmath43 we start proving that the solution of with initial conditions @xmath44 , @xmath45 and for @xmath46 is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the inverse of the error function @xmath49 notice that @xmath50 and @xmath51 . to obtain ,",
    "observe that from system   we arrive at the simple differential equation @xmath52 which has separable variables and can be solved by integration .",
    "the particular solution that passes by the point @xmath53 is @xmath54 combining and we obtain @xmath55 again a separable equation .",
    "it has the solution @xmath56 which is well defined for @xmath46 since @xmath57 is defined in @xmath58 . finally , by replacing @xmath59 in we obtain , as we wanted to prove .    by using @xmath60 and @xmath59 given by and , respectively , or using",
    ", we can draw the phase portrait of which , as we can see in figure [ figura1].(b ) , is symmetric with respect to both axes .",
    "notice that its orbits do not cross the @xmath61-axis , which is a singular locus for the associated vector field .",
    "moreover , the solutions of are not periodic ( see figure [ figura1].(a ) ) , and the transit time of @xmath60 from @xmath62 to @xmath5 is @xmath63 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     its period function is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the energy level of the orbit passing through the point @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , @xmath67 where we have used the change of variable @xmath68 and the symmetry with respect to @xmath69 then , @xmath70 if we prove that @xmath71 then @xmath72 and the theorem will follow . therefore , for completing the proof , it only remains to show that holds . for",
    "proving that , take any sequence @xmath73 with @xmath74 tending monotonically to infinity , and consider the functions @xmath75 we have that the sequence @xmath76 is formed by measurable and positive functions defined on the interval @xmath77 .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that it is a decreasing sequence . in particular , @xmath78 for all @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , if we show that @xmath80 is integrable , then we can apply the lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem  ( @xcite ) and will follow . to prove that @xmath81 note that for @xmath82 close to  1 , @xmath83 since this last expression is integrable the result follows by the comparison test for improper integrals .",
    "this section gives a brief description of the hbm applied the second order differential equations @xmath84 with @xmath85 , and adapted to our interests .",
    "notice that if @xmath60 is a solution of then @xmath86 also is a solution .",
    "suppose that equation has a @xmath87-periodic solution @xmath60 with initial conditions @xmath44 , @xmath88 and period @xmath89 if @xmath60 satisfies @xmath90 it is clear that its fourier series has no sinus terms and writes as @xmath91 as we have seen in previous section , the weak periodic solutions of equation @xmath92 that we want to approach satisfy the above property .",
    "moreover @xmath93 and @xmath94 does not exist . in any case , if we are searching smooth approximations to this @xmath60 , they should also satisfy @xmath95 and hence @xmath96 for this reason , in this work we will search fourier series in cosinus , not having the even terms @xmath97 , @xmath98 which do not satisfy this property .",
    "this type of a priori simplifications are similar to the ones introduced in @xcite for other problems .",
    "hence , in our setting , the hbm of order @xmath2 follows the next five steps :    \\1 .",
    "consider a trigonometric polynomial @xmath99    \\2 .",
    "compute the @xmath100-periodic function @xmath101 , which has also an associated fourier series , @xmath102 where @xmath103 @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "find all values @xmath106 and @xmath107 such that @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the value such that consists exactly of @xmath2 non trivial equations .",
    "notice also that each equation @xmath110 is equivalent to @xmath111    \\4 .",
    "then the expression , with the values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 obtained in point  3 , provide candidates to be approximations of the actual periodic solutions of the initial differential equation .",
    "in particular , the functions @xmath114 give approximations of the periods of the corresponding periodic orbits .",
    "choose , as final approximation , the one associated to the solution that minimizes the norm @xmath115",
    "\\(i ) notice that going from order @xmath2 to order @xmath116 in the method , implies to compute again all the coefficients of the fourier polynomial , because in general the common fourier coefficients of @xmath117 and @xmath118 do not coincide .",
    "\\(ii ) the above set of equations is a system of polynomial equations which usually is not easy to solve .",
    "for this reason in many works , see for instance @xcite and the references therein , only the values of @xmath3 are considered . for solving system for @xmath119",
    "we use the grbner basis approach @xmath120@xcite@xmath121 . in general",
    "this method is faster that using successive resultants and moreover it does not give spurious solutions .",
    "\\(iii ) as far as we know , the test proposed in point 5 to select the best approach is not commonly used .",
    "we propose it following the definition of accuracy of an approximated solution used in  @xcite and inspired in the classical works  @xcite .",
    "we start proving a lemma that will allow to reduce our computations to the case @xmath122      consider @xmath125 , with @xmath126 given in .",
    "we have to solve the set of @xmath116 non - trivial equations @xmath127 with @xmath116 unknowns @xmath128 and @xmath107 and @xmath129 the lemma clearly follows if we prove next assertion : @xmath130 and @xmath131 is a solution of   with @xmath132 if and only if @xmath133 and @xmath134 is a solution of  .",
    "this equivalence is a consequence of the fact that the change of variables @xmath135 writes the integral equation in   as @xmath136 and from the structure of the right hand side equation of .",
    "hence , @xmath137 as we wanted to prove .      @xmath43 following section [ hbm ] , we consider @xmath138 as the first approximation to the actual solution of the functional equation @xmath139 .",
    "then @xmath140 when @xmath141 the above expression writes as @xmath142 using for @xmath143 we get @xmath144 where @xmath145 . by using integration by parts",
    "we prove that @xmath146 combining this equality and we obtain that @xmath147 or equivalently , @xmath148 that in terms of @xmath149 coincides with .",
    "the case @xmath149 odd follows similarly .",
    "the only difference is that instead of condition to find @xmath150 we have to impose that @xmath151 because @xmath152      when @xmath156 , we take an approximation @xmath157 the vanishing of the coefficients of 1 and @xmath158 in the fourier series of @xmath159 provides the nonlinear system @xmath160 by solving it and applying point 5 in the hbm we get that @xmath161 therefore , @xmath162 as we wanted to prove .    for the third - order hbm we use as approximate solution @xmath163 imposing that the coefficients of 1 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 in @xmath166 vanish we arrive at the system @xmath167",
    "since all the equations are polynomial , the searching of its solutions can be done by using the grbner basis approach , see  @xcite .",
    "recall that the idea of this method consists in finding a new systems of generators , say @xmath168 of the ideal of @xmath169 $ ] generated by @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "hence , solving @xmath172 is equivalent to solve @xmath173 @xmath174 . in general",
    ", choosing the lexicographic ordering in the grbner basis approach , we get that the polynomials of the equivalent system have triangular structure with respect to the variables and it can be easily solved .        when @xmath182 we consider @xmath183 and we arrive at the system @xmath184 the grbner basis of @xmath185 with respect to the lexicographic ordering @xmath186 $ ] is a new basis with five polynomials , being one of them an even polynomial in @xmath187 of degree 16 with integers coefficients . solving it",
    "we obtain that the best approximation is @xmath188 which gives @xmath189    for @xmath190 and @xmath191 we have done similar computations . in the case @xmath190",
    "one of the generators of the grbner basis is an even polynomial in @xmath192 with integers coefficients and degree 32 .",
    "when @xmath191 the same happens but with a polynomial of degree 64 in @xmath193 .",
    "solving the corresponding polynomials we get that @xmath194 and @xmath195 , and consequently , @xmath196 and @xmath197      when @xmath201 doing similar computations that in item @xmath153 , we arrive at @xmath202 again , by searching the grbner basis of @xmath203 with respect to the lexicographic ordering @xmath204 $ ] we obtain a new basis with three polynomials , being one of them @xmath205 notice that the equation @xmath206 can be algebraically solved . nevertheless , for the sake of shortness , we do not give the exact roots .",
    "following again step 5 of our approach we get that the best solution is @xmath207 , or equivalently that @xmath208      computing the grbner basis of @xmath175 with respect to the lexicographic ordering @xmath176 $ ] we get that one of the polynomials of the new basis is an even polynomial in @xmath210 of degree 26 with integer coefficients . by solving it",
    "we obtain that the best approximation is @xmath211 , which produces the value @xmath212 of the statement .",
    "when @xmath182 we arrive at five polynomial equations , that we omit .",
