    "as an interesting field to study baryon spectrum and properties of strong interaction , double pion production in pion- , photo- and electro - induced reactions has been extensively explored  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have performed a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the double pion production in nucleon - nucleon collisions  @xcite based on the new data from celsius and cosy experiments in the past few years  @xcite .",
    "it is meaningful to extend the study to the closely related @xmath19 reactions , and herein we present the results .",
    "the experimental studies on the @xmath20 reactions were mainly performed in the years around 1970  @xcite with some additions on the @xmath21 channel by the jetset collaboration at 1997  @xcite .",
    "the data were still scarce . on theoretical side ,",
    "the one pion exchange ( ope ) model  @xcite and regge pole model  @xcite , focusing on the beam momenta above 3.0 gev , included the double-@xmath9 excitations only .",
    "however , on experimental side , there was an argument about the data of @xmath22 at the beam momenta around 3.0 gev  @xcite whether there was contribution from a @xmath17 with mass about 1400 mev and width about 80 mev , respectively .",
    "also , the experiment of @xmath22 at the beam momentum of 2.5 gev  @xcite claimed an enhancement at a @xmath23 invariant mass of 1370 mev . from the modern point of view , these data might show the presence of the roper resonance @xmath2 in the @xmath21 channel . as a matter of fact",
    ", the @xmath2 resonance should play essential role in this channel , which can be postulated from our analysis of @xmath24 reactions  @xcite where the @xmath2 was found to be important in the near - threshold region .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 resonances are also expected to show up in the @xmath20 reactions at high energies because they are found to be important to describe the data of @xmath27 reactions for the beam momenta around 3.0 gev  @xcite . up to now the properties of these resonances are not well established and especially the nature of @xmath2 is still in controversial  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is meaningful to examine whether @xmath28 reactions could supply us with useful information .",
    "also the @xmath1 channels could serve as a complementary place to test and verify the results of @xmath16 reactions . as we shall demonstrate later , some channels in antinucleon - nucleon collisions may be very suitable to settle down the problems found in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "our paper is organized as the following . in sect .",

    "we introduce the blatt - weisskopf barrier factors only for @xmath2-@xmath9-@xmath49 vertices because other resonances , namely @xmath65 and @xmath66 , begin to contribute at high energies so these factors have little influence on their behavior at the considered energies . on the other hand , as we have addressed , the data of nucleon - nucleon collisions at high energies are scarce so it is meaningful to decrease the adjustable parameters by using fewer form factors .",
    "if we would have enough data or go to higher energies it should be certainly necessary to include these form factors in the model .    because the mass of @xmath29-meson is near the two-@xmath49 threshold , the following lagrangians and form factor are employed for the @xmath29-@xmath49-@xmath49 vertex  @xcite , @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the relative momentum of the emitted pion in the center of mass system .",
    "we use @xmath96 gev and @xmath97 gev@xmath98 to normalize this form factor to unity when @xmath49- and @xmath29- meson are all on - shell . the decay width of @xmath99 and @xmath100 yield @xmath101 = @xmath102 and @xmath103 = @xmath104 .",

    "the coupling constants appearing in relevant resonances were determined by the empirical partial decay width of the resonances taken from particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , and the detailed calculations of @xmath120 and @xmath121 from the @xmath122 decay were given in ref .",
    "the values of cut - off in form factors were adjusted to fit the data of @xmath35 reactions by hand  @xcite . here",
    "we would like to mention that in our fit we first determined the cut - off values of @xmath9 and @xmath18 resonances by the @xmath123 channel which had very small @xmath17 contribution to be much cleaner , and then it was much easier for us to pin down the @xmath17 contributions by a large amount of data in @xmath124 and @xmath125 channels .",
    "we tried to use the same values in the same kind of form factors for all resonances with the aim to reduce the number of free parameters in the model .",
    "take the resonance form factor in eq .",
    "[ resonanceff ] for example , we employed @xmath108 = 1.0 gev for all the resonances .",
    "but in some of form factors , we used different cut - off values for resonances in order to reproduce the data better .",
    "for instance , the @xmath78 for @xmath65 in eq.[nmrformf ] was not the same with other resonances .",
    "it should be noted that we adopted a nearly half of the decay width of @xmath126 in pdg as the recent data of @xmath24 and @xmath127 reactions favored  @xcite .",
    "the used decay width of @xmath8 is the same with the value in pdg because we achieved an agreement with the data by adjusting the relevant cut - off parameters .",
    "so in our model a larger decay width of @xmath8 compared to pdg was not required .",
    "the values of coupling constants and cut - off used in our computation are compiled in table  [ coupling ] , together with the properties of the resonances and the central values of branch ratios . as we addressed , the parameters in table  [ coupling ] are the same as we used in the analysis of @xmath35 reactions  @xcite .",
    "so we do not introduce any further free parameters and the calculated results of @xmath34 in fact can be viewed as the predictions of our model .",
    "the amplitudes can be obtained straightforwardly by applying the feynman rules to the diagrams in fig .",
    "isospin coefficients are considered in different isospin channels .",
    "we do not include the interference terms among different diagrams because their relative phases are unknown .",
    "the valencia model seems to show that such terms are very small  @xcite , and our analysis of @xmath35 reactions also reproduce the data well without including these terms .",
    "the multi - particle phase space integration weighted by the amplitude squared can be performed by a monte carlo program using the code fowl from the cern program library  @xcite .",

    "demonstrate our calculated total cross sections of four isospin channels together with the existing data  @xcite .",
    "our numerical results give an overall good reproduction to all three initial @xmath128 channels , but overestimate the initial @xmath129 channel .",
    "this may be due to the fact that we have not treated the initial state interactions ( isi ) properly .",
    "the isi usually has a weak energy dependence for the meson production processes , so adjusting cutoff parameters in the form factors may partly account for it effectively as for the pp collision  @xcite .",
    "however , while the @xmath128 is a pure isospin - vector state , the @xmath129 is a mixture of isospin - scalar and isospin - vector . the annihilation rate for the isospin - scalar @xmath130 is empirically found to be bigger than the isospin - vector by a factor about 1.7  @xcite .",
    "the different annihilation rates will cause different isi reduction factors  @xcite .",
    "this effect is not taken into account in our model calculation .",
    "the final state interactions ( fsi ) may also cause smooth energy - dependent modifications to the total cross sections  @xcite .",
    "although the isi and fsi could be taken into account by some more complicated approaches  @xcite , they are still of some model dependence . since in this work we mainly investigate the relative importance of various resonance contributions , we have not included complicated treatments of isi and fsi which are not expected to influence our main conclusions .    in the following",
    ", we shall first address the @xmath131 channel because it is similar to the @xmath132 channel and has negligible @xmath17 contribution to be more clean .",
    "then we shall discuss other three channels .",
    "we use the same definitions of various differential cross sections as those used in @xmath27 reactions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the invariant mass spectra , and the angular distributions are all defined in the overall center of mass system .",
    "the values of vertical axis in the presented figures are all arbitrarily normalized .",

    "we try to give adequate information to the future measurements so we show a lot of observables predicted by our model in the following .",
    "panda is expected to install a @xmath143 solid angle detector with good particle identification for charged particles and photons to get the data of differential cross sections with good quality .",
    "then if there are any experimental results in the future we can immediately know whether our model works and which aspect should be improved in view of the shortcomings of our model .",
    "taking @xmath144 and @xmath145 as examples , we could identify the role of final state interaction and various resonances , respectively .",
    "the angular distributions are also useful to identify different contributions , especially some of which may be sensitive to the details of reaction mechanism .      for this channel",
    ", the @xmath147 and @xmath148 can not contribute .",
    "the @xmath149 term is dominant for the energies below 2000 mev in this channel as shown in fig .",
    "[ tcsmajor](c ) and fig .",
    "[ tcsminor](c ) . because the @xmath149 contribution is found to be important to describe the data of various @xmath35 reactions simultaneously  @xcite",
    ", it would be very useful to find other place to get some constrain on this term .",
    "the @xmath131 reaction is just an excellent place for such purpose . in fig .",
    "[ nnpipi ] we give the differential cross sections at the beam momentum of 1800 mev .",
    "the peak of invariant mass spectrum @xmath150 is obviously different from that in @xmath151 channel which makes it easy for us to identify the @xmath149 term .",
    "the steep rise of angular distribution @xmath152 in forward angle is distinct from the symmetric shape in @xmath151 .",
    "this is trivial because amplitudes are not symmetric in the exchange of the ( anti)nucleons in antinucleon - nucleon collisions .    for the energies above 2300 mev the @xmath65 and @xmath66 terms become significant and it is a good place to study the properties of them .",
    "the contribution from @xmath153 term begins to take over as the biggest one in this energy region .",
    "as pointed out in our analysis of @xmath35 , the @xmath132 is very crucial in determining the cut - off parameters for the form factors of relevant @xmath18 resonances due to the fact that this channel has negligible @xmath17 contribution .",
    "unfortunately , the current data of differential cross sections of @xmath151 suffer large uncertainties  @xcite because among its final four particles there are two neutrons which are difficult to detect . especially , it is hard to figure out that whether there is any dump hump structure or not in @xmath154 from the current data of @xmath151  @xcite .",
    "the channel of @xmath146 is just the same as clean as the @xmath151 but with only one antineutron in its final four particles , which can be easily reconstructed by the missing mass spectrum .",
    "another ambiguity may rise up from the spectator proton when deuteron target is used to analyze @xmath155 , but spectator model is repeatedly confirmed to be reliable in ( anti)nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "so @xmath146 reaction is strongly suggested to be analyzed in panda - fair and it will be very helpful to distinguish different models .      this channel is interesting because its double-@xmath9 contribution mainly comes from the simultaneous @xmath156 and @xmath157 excitation . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ tcsmajor](a ) and fig .",
    "[ tcsminor](a ) , for the energies below 1800 mev the @xmath158 term gives the largest contribution while the nucleon pole and @xmath159 terms also influence the near - threshold region significantly .",
    "for the energies above 1800 mev the double-@xmath9 term takes over to be the most important one while @xmath158 and @xmath160 rank the second and third , respectively .",
    "so unlike the @xmath161 and @xmath162 channels , in the whole energy region @xmath21 is not suitable to extract the decay widths of @xmath2 because of the large double-@xmath9 contribution .",
    "however , as the best measured channel in antinucleon - nucleon collisions , it is useful to test models . as shown in fig .",
    "[ tcsmajor](a ) and fig .",
    "[ tcsminor](a ) , our results overestimate the data of the @xmath163 channel for the beam momenta below 2.4 gev . as discussed at the beginning of this section , this may be caused by the isi and fsi which we have not included in our model calculation . the effects from isi and fsi will not influence much our estimation of relative contributions from various intermediate baryon resonances .",
    "this can be checked by the full phase space measurement at panda / fair .    in fig .",
    "[ 2picharge1100 ] and fig .  [ 2picharge1450 ]",
    "we show the calculated differential cross sections at the beam momenta of 1800 mev and 2200 mev , respectively .",
    "the @xmath158 , @xmath160 and double-@xmath9 contributions are comparable and have important contributions .",
    "our results are compatible with the old bubble chamber data measured at these energies  @xcite . very similar to the @xmath164 collisions ,",
    "the @xmath165 system is sensitive to the change of the contributions as can be seen in the @xmath166 and @xmath167 spectrums .",
    "the double hump structure in @xmath166 caused by the @xmath160 is obvious .",
    "the data of @xmath164 collisions did not support these structures  @xcite but the old bubble chamber data of @xmath21 gave obvious double hump in @xmath166 spectrums , especially at the beam momentum of about 1800 mev  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics was very low and the number of selected events for each beam momentum was at most several hundreds , so the measured results were inconclusive . on theoretical side , the interference terms between @xmath168 and @xmath126 might be relevant because their role on the @xmath165 invariant mass distributions have been found in @xmath169  @xcite and @xmath170  @xcite , so these terms should be treated with care in the future work .",
    "it should be mentioned that this problem may be related to the abc effect of double - pion production in nuclear fusion reactions  @xcite , so it is meaningful to extensively study it both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the luminosity of panda / fair is high enough to get the required production rates so the unsettled problem of the @xmath165 system can be further explored in @xmath21 channel .      in fig .",
    "[ tcsmajor](b ) and fig .",
    "[ tcsminor](b ) , the @xmath172 term is found to dominate in the whole considered energies and the nucleon pole term also gives significant contribution in the near - threshold region .",
    "it is worth to point out that unlike the @xmath173 channel , the isovector excitation of @xmath2 in @xmath171 is not enhanced compared to the @xmath174 because charged meson exchange is not allowed in both channels .",
    "so in a wide energy region it is suitable to explore the isoscalar excitation of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath160 term is the second largest for the beam momenta above 1500 mev and other contributions are much smaller . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pn2pi1100 ] , the angular distributions of @xmath175 and @xmath176 at 1800mev are sensitive to the presence of @xmath177 term .",
    "though there is possible ambiguity from the spectator proton when deuteron target is used in the experiment , this channel can be a better place to determine the partial decay widths of @xmath2 than @xmath161 and @xmath178 where they are complicated by other contributions , such as the double-@xmath9 and nucleon pole terms  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath158 term is not present in this reaction because the @xmath29-meson can not decay to @xmath180 .",

    "is very good .",
    "there are no data on these three channels yet .",
    "they can be measured by panda experiment .",
    "the amplitudes for the @xmath184 and @xmath182 channels are the same except for the difference of @xmath129 and @xmath128 fsi .",
    "a simultaneous measurement of these two channels may help us to understand the @xmath129 and @xmath128 fsi .",
    "these two reactions are also similar to the @xmath185 reaction except for a different @xmath186 fsi and interference between amplitudes by various meson exchanges .",

    "a simultaneous study of these @xmath190 and @xmath186 reactions may help to pin down contributions from various meson exchanges .",
    "in this paper , we present an analysis of four isospin channels of the @xmath20 reactions for the beam momenta of up to 3.0 gev within an effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the model parameters determined from the @xmath27 reactions are used without introducing any further free parameters .",
    "we include contributions from the @xmath2 , @xmath9 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and nucleon pole to give a reasonably explanation of the measured total cross sections .",
    "the role of the @xmath2 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 resonances in @xmath191 reactions have never been explored in previous studies .",
    "we give some typical differential cross sections which can be tested in the future measurements .",
    "we stress that panda ( anti - proton annihilation at darmstadt ) collaboration at the gsi - fair ( facility of antiproton and ion research ) could play an important role in the baryon spectrum and a large amount of events on final states with baryon and antibaryon should be analyzed to extract the properties of relevant resonances .",
