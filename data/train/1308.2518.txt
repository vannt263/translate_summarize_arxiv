    "the rare decays of neutral @xmath3-mesons into 2-body leptonic modes , @xmath4 for @xmath5 can happen in standard model(sm ) only through flavour changing neutral current(fcnc ) processes .",
    "they can not occur through tree level processes and can be mediated by only electro - weak box and z penguin diagrams and are extremely rare due to helicity suppression by @xmath6 factor where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the masses of the lepton @xmath5 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "these decays are further suppressed by @xmath9 due to an internal quark annihilation within the @xmath3 meson , where @xmath10 is the decay constant of the @xmath3 meson . in sm",
    ", the main uncertainty comes due to the partial knowledge of the decay constant and ckm matrix elements involved in these branching ratios(@xmath11 ) . though recently using different lattice qcd methods , error has been reduced in the estimation of these decay constants @xcite . in sm , @xcite , [ eq : sm - br ] ( b^0_se^+e^- ) & & ( 10 ^ -13 ) , + ( b^0_s^+^-)&=&(3.20.2)10 ^ -9 .",
    "+ ( b^0_s^+^- ) & & ( 10 ^ -6- 10 ^ -7 ) . due to smallness of the @xmath12 , verifying it is beyond the scope of present experimental limit .",
    "the @xmath13 is the largest of the helicity suppressed purely leptonic decays , since the amplitude is proportional to the mass of the lepton @xmath7 .",
    "however , the @xmath2 leptons are difficult to detect making the detection of this mode uniquely challenging . the complications for",
    "this mode arise not only from the combinatorial background but also from the fact that at least the two @xmath14 from the @xmath2 lepton decays are undetected and hence the two @xmath2 leptons can not be fully reconstructed . at present",
    "we do not have exact experimental numbers for most of these @xmath11s , but recently lhcb collaboration @xcite has given experimental data on [ eq : exp - brmu1 ] ( b^0_s^+^- ) & = & 2.9^+1.1_-1.0 10 ^ -9 and cms has given @xcite [ eq : exp - brmu2 ] ( b^0_s^+^- ) & = & 3.0^+1.0_-0.9 10 ^ -9 .",
    "in this paper we mainly concentrate on @xmath15 channel , except @xmath16 .",
    "we consider that np contribution in @xmath17 can occur only through loop level process like its sm counterpart . with this assumption , the effective hamiltonian for the process @xmath17 can be written in terms of three distinct dirac bilinear contributions as ( almost same as @xcite ) @xmath18 and the matrix element for the process can be written as @xcite : @xmath19,\\ ] ] where , @xmath20    @xmath21 is the axial vector - axial vector type interaction term .",
    "it is present in the sm and in general , this type of coupling may be present in np too .",
    "the @xmath7 factor before @xmath21 comes due to helicity suppression .",
    "we divide @xmath21 into two terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath22 is solely the sm part and @xmath23 is coming due to the np contribution and we call it as @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the pseudo scalar - pseudo scalar and pseudo scalar - scalar type interaction terms respectively .",
    "@xmath25 can have a possible sm contribution from a neutral goldstone boson penguin diagram @xcite and @xmath26 can have a possible sm contribution from sm higgs penguin diagram @xcite .",
    "but these contributions from sm higgs and neutral goldstone bosons to the amplitude are further suppressed by @xmath27 compared to the dominant contribution .",
    "that is why the sm contributions in @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be ignored and it can be considered that they are coming from purely np contribution . for our discussion",
    "we distinguish these two terms as @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively . in this hamiltonian",
    "as both np and sm are appearing at loop level , we have separated out @xmath30 and ckm elements from the @xmath31 couplings unlike @xcite .",
    "+ in sm , @xmath21 coupling is identical for the process @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , whereas in existing np models like mssm , 2hdm , top - color assisted lht models , it has been shown that @xmath25 and @xmath26 get @xmath7 suppression factor @xcite due to the involvement of various np particles in box , penguin and fermion self - energy diagrams . but",
    "no such effect of @xmath7 suppression factor has been predicted for @xmath23 coupling in existing literature . in our paper , we consider @xmath22 and @xmath23 are same , whereas @xmath25 and @xmath26 have a @xmath7 suppression factor for @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath35 .",
    "with this assumption , it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab ] ) that both @xmath36 and @xmath37 will differ for different @xmath35 due to the involvement of different lepton masses . + lhcb and cms data of the @xmath38 is in the same ballpark of the sm , but it is not ruling out the possibility of the presence of new physics coming from any one of the three different type of np interaction terms .",
    "we have to wait till the experimental error reduces to have any conclusive remark on the presence of new physics in this leptonic decay mode .",
    "there is a possibility that all of @xmath24 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 terms are present but they are cancelling each other in such a fashion that at the end of the day the sm term gives the main contribution in the branching ratio .",
    "another possibility is that any one of the np and sm terms are mutually cancelling each other and contribution from rest of the two np terms satisfies the experimental data .",
    "our main intention is to construct such observables which can separate out the effect of the presence of the np contribution from its sm counterpart or at least identify the prominent presence of np .",
    "+ considering the general hamiltonian , it has been shown that the @xmath21 term is nothing but the willson coefficient @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we are not taking the value of @xmath21 exactly same as @xmath39 as there is some uncertainty .",
    "we constrain the parameter space for @xmath22 from the sm estimated value of @xmath38 and then using this constraint we figure out the allowed parameter space for the modulus of @xmath23 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 from the experimental data of @xmath38 . from these constraints we can figure out the sizes for the modulus of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , whereas we can not obtain any bound on the phase factor of these couplings .",
    "we choose that the phases can vary from @xmath44 for the @xmath31 couplings involved in @xmath45 as in general these couplings can be complex . using these constraints",
    "we figure out the sizes of @xmath46 and @xmath47 . with these allowed sets of @xmath46 and @xmath47 we present an angular analysis of the cascade decay of @xmath1 in a model independent fashion to check whether we can separate out @xmath47 ( which is purely np contribution ) from @xmath46 or we can establish a measurable difference between sm and np effect due to @xmath46 itself .",
    "isolation of @xmath47 will help us further to constrain the scalar sector .",
    "here we would like to mention that it has been shown in literature that np contribution in @xmath48 can be much larger ,   3% - 10% @xcite,@xcite which will open up many more ways to find np signature . + in section ii we constrain the parameter space for @xmath22(sm ) , @xmath23(@xmath24 ) , @xmath40(@xmath28 ) and @xmath41(@xmath29 ) , using the experimental branching ratio for @xmath49 .",
    "for this purpose we quote the relevant formulae and present the necessary numerical input .",
    "section iii.a deals with the cascade decays of @xmath45 .",
    "the choice of reference frame for this cascade decay is discussed in detail . the angular analysis for the cascade decay",
    "is discussed in section iii.b .",
    "various observables which help to establish the fact that the presence of np makes a measurable difference from sm are discussed in this section too .",
    "we conclude and summarize in section iv . in appendix",
    ", we present the matrix element square for the cascade decay of @xmath3 .",
