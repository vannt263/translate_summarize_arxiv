    "in this paper we continue a series dedicated to the presentation of near - infrared photometry ( in @xmath2 and @xmath3 pass - bands ) for northern galactic open clusters .",
    "we already reported on the very young open clusters ngc  1893 and berkeley  86 ( vallenari et al 1999 ) , the old clusters berkeley  17 and berkeley  18 ( carraro et al 1999a ) , the intermediate age clusters ic  166 and ngc  7789 ( vallenari et al 2000 ) and king  5 ( carraro & vallenari 2000 ) . here",
    "we combine optical @xmath0 and @xmath1 and near - infrared @xmath2 and @xmath3 photometry for ngc  2141 , a faint old open cluster which did not receive much attention in the past .",
    "+ ngc  2141 is located close to the galactic plane in the antic - enter direction at @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and it is designated also as ocl  487 ( lund  203 ) and c0600 + 104 by iau . its diameter is estimated to be about @xmath7 . + a preliminary investigation was conducted by burkhead et al ( 1972 ) who obtained photographic and photoelectric @xmath8 photometry for about 300 stars with the aim of assessing whether the cluster is very old .",
    "this study revealed that ngc  2141 is a cluster of late intermediate age , 4.4  kpc distant from the sun , and with a reddening e(b - v)=0.30 .",
    "+ the metal abundance of ngc  2141 has been determined several times in the past .",
    "janes ( 1979 ) obtained a value @xmath9~=~-0.54\\pm0.42 $ ] from ddo photometry , while geisler ( 1987 ) obtained @xmath9~=~-0.63\\pm0.15 $ ] from washington photometry .",
    "finally , by using medium resolution spectroscopy of six giant stars friel & janes ( 1993 ) found @xmath9~=~-0.39\\pm0.11 $ ]    the kinematics of ngc  2141 has been studied by friel et al ( 1989 ) and friel ( 1989 ) . this latter study ( 5 stars )",
    "indicates that the radial velocity is @xmath10 .",
    "individual radial velocities for 15 stars have been obtained by minniti ( 1995 ) .",
    "this survey has only one star in common with friel ( 1989 ) and the radial velocity estimate is in agreement , suggesting that most of minniti ( 1995 ) stars might probably be cluster non members .",
    "anyway , a much deeper investigation is required to isolate cluster members in ngc  2141 . + more recently rosvick ( 1995 ) published optical @xmath11 photometry of 3561 stars in ngc  2141 together with @xmath12 infrared photometry for a handful of stars .",
    "this is the first comprehensive study of ngc  2141 .",
    "the author infers by comparison with half solar ( z  =  0.006 ) isochrones an age of 2.5  gyr , a distance of 4.2  kpc and a reddening e(b - v)=0.35 .",
    "+ in this paper we combine ir @xmath13 ( 765 stars ) and optical @xmath14 ( 1073 stars ) photometry to obtain new estimates of the cluster fundamental parameters .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : section  2 is devoted to the presentation of data acquisition and reduction ; section  3 deals with the morphology of the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for different pass - bands ; section  4 concerns the derivation of the cluster metallicity , whereas section  5 deals with the estimate of color excess . section  6 is devoted to infer the age and distance , while in section  7 we discuss the luminosity function .",

    "about 10 standard stars per night have been used .",

    "this error is only due to the linear interpolation of the standard stars .",
    "the calibration uncertainty is dominated by the error due to the correction from aperture photometry to psf fitting magnitude .",
    "the standard stars used for the calibration do not cover the entire color range of the data , because of the lack of stars redder than @xmath30 . from our data , no color term is found for @xmath3 mag , whereas we can not exclude it for the @xmath2 magnitude . taking all into account",
    ", we estimate that the total error on the calibration is about 0.1 mag in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 pass - bands ( see vallenari et al 2000 for additional details ) .",
    "ngc  2141 was observed with the 2.2 m eso / mpi telescope at la silla .",
    "the focal reducer eso efosc 2 camera was used , equipped with the thompson uv coated 1000 @xmath19 1000 pixels ccd eso @xmath31  19 .",
    "the chip has 19 micron pixel size , corresponding to @xmath32 projected on the sky .",
    "the total field of view is about @xmath33 .",
    "the observations have been carried out in 1991 december 8 ( see table  2 for details . ) the night was photometric with an average seeing of @xmath34 . several standard field stars from landolt ( 1992 ) have been observed during the same night , from which the following color equations have been derived :    @xmath35    @xmath36    after the standard pre - processing , instrumental magnitudes have been extracted using daophot  ii and the accompanying allstar program in the midas environment .",
    "since the field is relatively crowding free , the aperture corrections have been directly computed on the original frames , giving the coefficient within a 0.02 magnitude spread .",
    "the final errors in the zero points amount to 0.02 both in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 . the comparison of 5 stars in common with burkhead et al ( 1972 ) yields :    @xmath37    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 refer to burkhead et al ( 1972 ) and the present work , respectively .",
    "+ we estimated the photometric errors by means of experiments with artificial stars ( carraro & ortolani 1994 ) , obtaining errors of 0.02 , 0.04 and 0.08 at @xmath1 = 18 , 19 and 20 mag , respectively .",
    "another estimate of the photometric errors derives from the ms natural width . at the same above magnitude levels we found dispersions in color of 0.11 , 0.16 and 0.20 .",
    "these latter values clearly take into account also the effect of unresolved binaries ( see the sequence rightwards of the ms in figs .  2 and 3 ) and possible variable reddening .",
    "in this section we discuss separately the cmds obtained from the optical and near ir photometry .",
    "the cmd derived from optical photometry is shown in fig .  2 . +",
    "the global morphology resembles the cmd of an intermediate age or old open cluster like ngc  7789 ( girardi et al 2000a ) , ic  4651 ( bertelli et al .",
    "1992 ) and ngc  2204 ( kassis et al .",
    "1997 ) , say a cluster whose age is between ngc  752 ( 1.7 gyr ) and m  67 ( 4.0 gyr ) ( carraro et al .",
    "the ms extends down to @xmath41 , and the turn off point ( to ) is situated at @xmath42 , @xmath43 , with a few star spreading towards brighter regions ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the concentration of stars in the red region of the diagram ( at @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) represents the red giant ( rg ) clump of core he - burning stars .",
    "note the tilt and the extension of the clump in color , which can be ascribed to a possible spread in metallicity or in age , or to the presence of some differential reddening .",
    "the most reasonable explanation is a metallicity effect . indeed",
    "the ms is rather thin up to the limiting magnitude , thus ruling out a significant age dispersion .",
    "a secondary sequence of unresolved binary stars is visible on the red side of the ms .",
    "this is more evident from fig .  3 , where only the core of the cluster is considered .",
    "by counting the number of stars belonging to the two different sequences , we find that the binary percentage amounts as minimum at 30% . finally , the herzsprung gap is clearly defined , while the sub - giant and rg branch are scarcely populated . + the population of stars on the right side of the ms and above the to probably belongs to the field or they might be blue stragglers which are members of the cluster .",
    "the field stars contamination in fact is not very high .",
    "the ms is much thinner than in rosvick ( 1995 ) even after the field stars decontamination ( see her fig .  5 ) .",
    "this rules out the presence of a significant differential reddening across the @xmath47 region covered by the present photometry .",
    "+      the cmd from ir photometry is shown in fig .",
    "the ms extends down to @xmath48 , and the to is located at @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the region above the to might contain some interlopers ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "+ the stars at @xmath51 , @xmath52 might represent the clump of core he burners .",
    "the cluster is indeed faint , and the ms gets rather wide down to @xmath53 .",
    "the ms is much larger than in the optical cmd , due to the larger photometric errors we have in the ir photometry ( see section  2 ) .",
    "apparently there is no herzsprung gap , and the rgb is scarsely populated , but sufficiently evident to be used to estimate cluster metallicity ( see next section ) .",
    "the cmd diagram in the ir allows us to derive an independent estimate of the cluster abundance by using a photometric method ( tiede et al .",
    "this method correlates the slope of the rgb , defined as @xmath54 with the cluster metallicity , measured by the index [ fe / h ] , and for open clusters , the relation reads :    @xmath55 = -1.639 - 14.243 \\times ( gb slope).\\ ] ]    this method has already been applied by us in the study of ngc  7789 ( vallenari et al 2000 ) .",
    "+ to find the rgb slope we performed a least squares fit to the rgb stars .",
    "this yields a rgb slope @xmath56 of -0.085 @xmath57 0.006 . by using the relation ( 3 ) ,",
    "we obtain [ fe / h ] = -0.43 @xmath57 0.07 . the reported error is derived as :    @xmath58 ) = 14.243 \\times \\delta(gb slope).\\ ] ]    and has to be considered as an optimistic estimate , since it does not take into account the uncertainties in the coefficients of eq .  3 , and the sensitivity of the rgb slope to the method adopted for its computation .",
    "however the value we find implies a metal content closer to the spectroscopic estimate ( -0.39 @xmath57 0.11 , friel & janes 1993 ) than all the other photometric estimates ( janes 1979 , geisler 1987 ) .",
    "in order to derive the interstellar extinction for ngc  2141 , we have combined optical and ir photometry ( @xmath59 stars in total ) , and construct two color diagrams , namely @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which are shown in fig .  5 and fig .  6 , respectively .",
    "only ms stars are considered to avoid evolutionary effects .",
    "we superimposed a zero age ms ( zams ) for the theoretical metal content @xmath62 , obtained translating the observed @xmath9 $ ] by means of the relation :    @xmath55 = \\log \\frac{z}{0.019}\\ ] ]    taken from girardi et al .",
    "( 2000b ) . in fig .  5",
    "the fit has been obtained by shifting the zams with e(j - k )  =  0.07 and e(v - k )  =  0.35 , which corresponds to a ratio @xmath63 , relatively close to the value @xmath64 suggested by cardelli et al ( 1989 ) .",
    "+ the fit in fig .",
    "6 , on the other hand , has been achieved by shifting the zams by e(b - v )  =  0.40 and e(v - k )  =  0.35 , whose ratio turns out to be @xmath65 , in agreement with the value @xmath66 from cardelli et al ( 1989 ) .",
    "although reasonable , these estimates are affected by the limitation that the reddening vector is almost parallel to the zams , especially in the @xmath60 plane .",
    "this is a minor problem in the plane @xmath61 , where we obtain a reddening value e@xmath67= 0.40 , not much different from e@xmath67  =  0.35 derived by rosvick ( 1995 ) .",
    "we must stress however that rosvick ( 1995 ) did not take into account the metallicity of ngc  2141 , which is lower than the sun .",
    "the knowledge of metallicity and reddening , allows us to infer the distance and age of ngc  2141 by means of fitting with isochrones ( girardi et al .",
    "the fit is shown in the two panels of fig .  7 , for the planes @xmath1 vs @xmath67 , and @xmath3 vs @xmath68 .",
    "+ we have adopted the theoretical metallicity @xmath62 derived above , and performed the fitting with a @xmath69 isochrone , which better matches the observational data .",
    "the criterion that guided us in performing this comparison was the simultaneous fit of the to and the clump magnitudes .",
    "since no membership exists for this cluster , it is not possible to exactly define the ms to , which is populated also by unresolved binary stars , and interlopers . by using the reddening estimated derived in the previous section , the apparent distance moduli @xmath70 and @xmath71 , in the plots turn out to be @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the latter value can also be obtained assuming that the mean clump magnitude is @xmath74 ( girardi et al 1998 ) .",
    "once corrected , these values converge to the absolute distance modulus @xmath75 .",
    "this value is in agreement within the errors with rosvick ( 1995 ) estimate .",
    "+ ngc  2141 turns out to be @xmath76  kpc distant from the sun , and about 12.0  kpc far from the galactic center .",
    "in this section we compute the differential luminosity function lf in the v band .",
    "the data from the cluster have been previously corrected for completeness ( see carraro & ortolani 1994 for details ) .",
    "it resulted 100% up to @xmath1  =  19 , then 85% at 19.7 , 73% at 20.2 and 66% at @xmath1  =  20.7 .",
    "fainter bins have not been considered because of the large amount of correction . +",
    "this lf is compared in fig .  8 with thoretical ones for the same age range ( 1.5 , 2.5 and 3.5  gyr ) and metallicity ( z=0.007 ) of ngc  2141 .",
    "the theoretical lfs have been calculated by assuming the imf proposed by kroupa et al ( 1993 ) , which is somewhat steeper than the classical salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , and best suited for the solar neighbourhood .",
    "it reads :    @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "+ the comparison clearly shows that the agreement with theoretical models is good up to @xmath4  =  5.0 . at fainter luminosities",
    "the theoretical models predict a higher number of stars , increasing with decreasing magnitudes .",
    "this occurs in the main sequence at about 1.0 @xmath80 , while the to corresponds to about 1.4 @xmath80 .",
    "+ it seems more reasonable to interpret these data as a more common mass segregation effect with low mass stars evaporated from the cluster center .",
    "in this paper we have presented a detailed study of the poorly known intermediate age open cluster ngc  2141 . by combining optical and ir photometry",
