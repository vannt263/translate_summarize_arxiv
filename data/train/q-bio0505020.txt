    "a central parameter within infection epidemiology is the basic reproduction number @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is used to estimate whether a disease is contagious enough to generate an epidemic in a specific population . in its simplest form ,",
    "is defined as the expected number of individuals that an infected individual will infect in a completely susceptible population .",
    "if all individuals in a population have approximately the same number of contacts , and the probability that any pair of individuals will meet is equal , @xmath0 can be estimated by the function below : @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for umber of contacts per time unit , @xmath3 or likelihood of passing on an infection per contact , and @xmath4 for the average time an individual is infectious ( measured in same time unit as @xmath2 ) . to make an epidemic possible , the infected person must infect more than one person on average .",
    "the threshold value for epidemics is therefore @xmath5 .",
    "studies have shown that @xmath0 in its simplest form may yield misleading results .",
    "anderson and may have demonstrated that a great variation in number of contacts may compensate for a low average number of contacts  @xcite .",
    "this is because individuals with many contacts have a far greater probability of becoming infected , and of passing on an infection .",
    "therefore , in populations with great variation in number of contacts , @xmath0 should be calculated as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the variance in the number of contacts .",
    "another reason that @xmath0 can be an oversimplification is that most contact networks studied are known to differ significantly from random interaction .",
    "many contact networks are characterized by a high level of transitivity ; that is , the number of triangles in the network is much larger than is found in an average network having the same frequency distribution of number of contacts  @xcite .",
    "a large clustering coefficient tends to slow down epidemics because the probability that an infected person s contacts will already be infected is very high in such a network  @xcite .",
    "a common way to estimate clustering in a network is to estimate its relative number of triangles , or more exactly , to calculate the fraction @xmath8 of all paths of length three in the network which form a triangle : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of triangles ( fully connected subgraphs of three vertices ) and @xmath11 is the number of triples of vertices connected by two or three contacts .",
    "the factor three is needed to normalize @xmath8 to the interval @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "another difference between contact and random networks is that most contact networks are assortative by number of contacts  @xcite .",
    "this means that individuals who have many contacts tend to have contact with other individuals who also have many contacts , and vice versa . the number of contacts is usually referred to as `` degree '' in network theory , and we will use this term here .",
    "high assortativity decreases the epidemic threshold value among individuals who have many contacts .",
    "the standard measure is the assortative mixing coefficient @xmath13 ; that is , the symmetric correlation coefficient between the individuals degrees on each side of all contacts : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the degree of the @xmath16th argument in a list of the contacts  @xcite .",
    "we will now construct networks generated from a unique database consisting of 295,108 individuals who were registered as `` in - patients '' at any hospital in stockholm county ( pop .",
    "1.8 million ) during 2001 and 2002 .",
    "we want a contact to represent closeness in space and time .",
    "our spatial requirement is that two patients should be on the same ward . for the temporal aspect we let closeness be a network parameter , and",
    "we regard a contact between patients as established if they were hospitalized on the same ward for a duration @xmath17 ( overlap time ) or longer .",
    "a @xmath18 means that contacts between one patient who was admitted the same day as another patient was discharged are included .",
    "furthermore , we let the sampling time window size @xmath19 be another parameter .",
    "the two parameters @xmath17 and @xmath19 yield different networks that are relevant to different diseases .",
    "for example , for diseases such as measles , sars , and norovirus , which spread rapidly , a narrow time window will be appropriate  @xcite ; for diseases requiring prolonged contact for transmission , like tuberculosis , the relevant network is represented by a larger @xmath17 .",
    "we will start by plotting the probability density function @xmath20 for an individual to have @xmath21 contacts .",
    "this function is plotted for , respectively :    * one weekday in january . * the entire month of january . * the first six months of 2001 . * the whole period 2001 - 2002 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : deg]a we see the development of this contact structure from an exponential distribution to a degree distribution with a truncated `` fat tail . ''",
    "it is clear that variation in the number of contacts between individuals increases with time .",
    "figure  [ fig : deg]b shows the degree to which calculated using equation  [ eq : r0 ] must be compensated according to equation  [ eq : r0mod ] for this increase in variation .",
    "the skewed degree distribution in our case is related to the power - law - like distribution of hospitalization times ( see figure  [ fig : hosp ] and sect .  [",
    "sect : hosp ] ) .",
    "the distribution of hospitalization will indirectly lead to `` preferential attachment ''  @xcite ( that is , a heightened probability of high - degree vertices to form additional contacts)a well known mechanism for producing fat - tailed degree distributions  @xcite .         we will now investigate how transitivity , @xmath8 , and assortativity , @xmath13 , vary with sampling time , @xmath19 , and overlap time , @xmath17 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cr](a ) we display the clustering coefficient , @xmath8 , and in figure  [ fig : cr](b ) the level of assortative mixing , @xmath13 , as functions of our time intervals @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "we note that both parameters exhibit a very similar functional form . @xmath8 and @xmath13 both decrease with @xmath19 when",
    "is held constant for small @xmath17 , butincrease when tol is held constant for large values of @xmath17 .",
    "both parameters behave in a similar way when @xmath19 is held constant . for small values of @xmath17 ,",
    "the parameters first increase and then start to decrease as a function of @xmath17 . for large values of @xmath17 , both parameters first increase with @xmath17 until they converge at a high level of clustering and assortativity .",
    "the estimated high levels for the @xmath8 and the @xmath13 parameters , and the resemblance in functional form between the @xmath13-surface and the @xmath8-surface in figure  [ fig : cr ] are a consequence of the compartmental structure of the healthcare system .",
    "assume a hypothetical network , @xmath22 in which all inpatients stay on the same ward during the entire duration of @xmath19 .",
    "in such a network , each inpatient will have a link to each other inpatient on the same ward .",
    "the level of clustering between the inpatients will therefore equal 1 , both locally on each ward and globally throughout the whole healthcare system , because no links exist between inpatients on different wards in @xmath22 .",
    "it is trivial that the level of assortativity can only be defined if there is a variation in ward size , and that @xmath13 in these cases must equal 1 because the degree of contacts on each side of each link will be equal .",
    "our results show that networks defined by a large value of @xmath17 and a large value of @xmath19 come very close to @xmath22 . both @xmath8 and @xmath13",
    "are large , and the vast majority of individuals in these networks are registered as inpatients only once per ward ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "if we relax the restrictions on @xmath22 such that each inpatient stays on the same ward during the entire period of @xmath19 , the @xmath8 and @xmath13 parameters may drop below 1 .",
    "this makes it possible for triples , which not are triangles , to be formed between inpatients that stay on different wards , and between inpatients that stay on the same wards but at different times .",
    "this also makes it possible for links to form between nodes with different degrees .",
    "the same occurs where @xmath19 increases when @xmath17 is held constant for low levels of @xmath17 .",
    "the decay in @xmath8 and @xmath13 is a result of the skew distribution of hospitalization times ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hosp])a long - term patient a will form a triple ( but not a triangle ) with the many pairs of short - term patients whose hospitalization does not overlap with each other s but does overlap with a. this situation , and the number of inpatients who stay on more than one ward , will be more common for larger time windows , causing @xmath8 , and consequently @xmath13 , to decay over time .",
    "that c increases with @xmath17 ( for fixed @xmath19 ) may seem counterintuitive : as @xmath17 grows , the network will have fewer edges , and also fewer triangles .",
    "we have constructed a simple agent - based model that shows that a prerequisite for this is the observed skewed distribution of hospital stays ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) .",
    "our study of a very large inpatient database shows that hospital systems characteristically have a very large variation in duration of hospital stays , which generates a correspondingly large variation in number of contacts .",
    "we have further shown that the clustering coefficient and assortative mixing depend greatly on sampling time and the length of time that two inpatients must spend together for contact to be effected .",
    "both of these coefficients , @xmath8 and @xmath13 , become extremely large in our real - life network when @xmath17 and @xmath19 are large .",
    "this is alarming because it has been shown that both a high level of clustering and a high level of assortative interaction decrease the epidemic threshold  @xcite .",
    "any strategy to intervene with disease spread in a hospital environment must take into account this departure from assumptions of random interaction and homogenous mixing . for infections with high transmissibility ,",
    "short incubation times and short duration of infectiousness , such as norovirus infections and sars , our finding may be less important .",
    "however , for diseases such as tuberculosis or mrsa characterized by low transmissibility and long duration of infectiousness , it becomes necessary to take this variation into consideration because a high variance will lower the epidemic threshold .",
    "our findings indicate that the individuals with many contacts are significant for the spread of infectious diseases with long duration of infectiousness .",
    "these high - risk individuals will probably be identifiable through hospital patient registration systems , and should be the first to be targeted by contact tracing .",
    "the high level of clustering further indicates that it may be worth screening all inpatients that have spent time on the same ward as positive inpatients before and after the positive inpatients were there .",
    "the high level of clustering makes it reasonable to assume that more than one inpatient will be infectious at the same time on the same ward , and consequently that the disease would have existed among the inpatients on the ward both before and after the actual inpatient in question was on the ward .",
    "this research is supported by the swedish emergency management agency , european research nest project dysonet 012911 .",
    "the data has generously been made available by stockholm county council with help from torsten siegel .",
    "the study was conducted with permission from the regional ethical review board in stockholm ( record 2004/5:8 ) .",
    "the dataset contains information for 570,382 ward admissions , including date of admission , date of discharge , and ward identity .",
    "there were a total of 702 wards located at 52 different geographical units such as hospitals and nursing homes .",
    "the mean daily number of patients on the wards for the two - year period varied between 1 and 69 ( mean 10.05 , sd 9.44 ) . wards with a large number of inpatients per year strongly tend toward shorter duration of inpatient hospital stays , and vice versa , as shown in figure  [ fig : dur ] .    as described in the sect .",
    "[ sec : cont ] , we define a network as the individuals who have been inpatients some time during the sample time , @xmath19 , and a contact as a link between two individuals who have been inpatients on the same ward for a duration @xmath23 . figure  [ fig : nm]a and [ fig : nm]b show the number of nodes , @xmath24 , and the number of links , @xmath25 , for nodes having at least one link with a duration @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 surfaces show a large variation in absolute size .",
    "the surface for the number of vertices per node shows a similar surface .",
    "the quote between the largest value and smallest value is , however , smaller by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the number of healthcare occasions and number of different wards visited during the period under study varies a widely for different values of , @xmath17 ( see figure  [ fig : hc_occ ] ) .",
    "the number of separate healthcare occasions for all contacts , that is , to @xmath27 , in particular exhibits a fat tail .",
    "this holds to some extent for the number of visited wards as well .",
    "the individuals who had at least one contact with a duration of at least 100 days are thus considerably less mobile between the wards in the hospital system than those who have not .",
    "the dataset is associated with one known systematic bias in the sense that one single inpatient may be registered as an inpatient on two wards at the same time such as when an inpatient is moved for a short period but is expected to return .",
    "our analyses show that one single individual is registered on two separate wards 6734 times .",
    "we have not been able to show that these biases have any significant effect on the results we are presenting in this paper and will therefore use the whole dataset in our analyzes .",
    "in figure  [ fig : expo ] we have plotted the cumulative distribution , of @xmath28 , for all healthcare occasions in 2001 .",
    "this allows us to plot the cumulative distribution in the interval 1 to 365 days for all of these healthcare occasions without interference from any finite size effects of the material in this interval .",
    "the plot shows that the duration of hospital stays exhibits a skewed power - law - like tail , @xmath29 .",
    "we estimate the slope , @xmath30 , in the interval @xmath31 $ ] by fitting @xmath30 in @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a normalization factor .",
    "a maximum likelihood procedure was used for the estimation .",
    "the 95% confidence intervals were estimated by bootstrapping .",
    "figure  [ fig : expo]a and [ fig : expo]b show how @xmath30 changes when @xmath34 is increased .",
    "to answer the question why @xmath8 increases with @xmath17 ( for fixed @xmath19 ) we construct a simple agent - based model of a healthcare system from first principles : suppose a healthcare system of nw wards of equal capacity is intended to serve a population of @xmath24 individuals . each day",
    "a non - hospitalized individual hospitalized with a probability @xmath35 and will stay for a random time @xmath36 ( of some distribution @xmath37 ) on ward @xmath38 ( how the ward is chosen is discussed below ) .",
    "after hospitalization the patient is either transferred to another ward with probability @xmath39 for a duration of a new t or discharged .",
    "this dynamic , given a @xmath19 and @xmath17 , yields networks just like our real data did .",
    "how shall we assign patients to the wards ?",
    "the simplest assumption is to choose the wards with equal probability .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : model ] , this yields the shape of @xmath8 and @xmath13 seen in figure  [ fig : cr ] .",
    "one important feature is missing from this model : different specialty wards hospitalize patients for different durations .",
    "if we incorporate this , the curves stay qualitatively the same . from the model",
    ", we understand that for large overlap times the long - term patients form densely connected components  otherwise the network is empty .",
    "the model is insensitive to parameter values .",
    "a skewed @xmath37 function is , however , needed .      1 .",
    "go through all healthy ( non - hospitalized ) patients . with a probability",
    "@xmath35 hospitalize a patient .",
    "the duration of the hospitalization is given by @xmath37 .",

    "if needed , construct the network according to the method detailed in the sect .",
    "[ sec : cont ] .    to assign a ward given a hospitalization time , we propose two different methods .",
    "the first option is to select the ward by uniform randomness .",
    "clearly , this will , on average , make all wards equally full .",
    "this method is used for the `` no diff .",
    "'' curves in figure  [ fig : hosp ] . however , the hospitalization times are very different  on some wards , the hospitalization time is much longer than average ; on others , people stay for very short periods . to model this",
    ", we differentiate strictly between the wards so that the patients on ward @xmath41 always stay a shorter time than the patients on ward @xmath42 .",
    "we implement this by generating @xmath43 random numbers distributed according to @xmath37 .",
    "then we sort these values in increasing values of @xmath36 and associate ward 1 with the @xmath36-values @xmath44 $ ] , ward 2 with the @xmath36-values @xmath45 $ ] , and so on , such that the sum of @xmath36-values are the same for all wards . during the iterations ,",
    "a random value of the array of random numbers is drawn and the patient is assigned to the corresponding pre - assigned ward .",
    "we use @xmath46 for figure  [ fig : model ] . the same plot with @xmath47 yields indistinguishable curves .",
    "this is the method used for the `` diff .",
