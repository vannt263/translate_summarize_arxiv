    "transient black hole binaries ( bhbs ) display outbursts exhibiting several states , characterized by both spectral and timing properties ( e.g. belloni et al . 2005 ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 ; belloni 2010 ; gilfanov 2010 ) . during the outburst , sources typically follow a q shaped , anti - clockwise track on a plot of x - ray flux versus spectral hardness ratio ( hardness - intensity diagram : hid ) , with the quiescent state occupying the bottom right corner . the initial transition from hard ( lhs ) to soft ( hss ) , via intermediate states , occurs when the power low component of the spectrum is observed to soften ( photon index @xmath2 1.72.4 ) and a disc blackbody component ( peaking in soft x - rays ) becomes increasingly prominent .",
    "a power spectral analysis of the rapid variability reveals a quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) , which shows up as narrow harmonically related peaks , superimposed on broad band continuum noise .",
    "the qpo fundamental frequency is observed to increase from @xmath3 0.110 hz during the transition from the hard state , after which the x - ray emission becomes very stable in the soft state .",
    "power spectral evolution correlates tightly with spectral evolution , with all the characteristic frequencies increasing with spectral hardness ( e.g. wijnands & van der klis 1998 ; psaltis , belloni & van der klis 1999 ; homan et al . 2001 ) .",
    "qpos observed coincident with broad band noise are defined as type - c qpos ( remillard et al .",
    "2002 ; casella et al .",
    "type - b qpos ( wijnands , homan & van der klis 1999 ) , typically with a frequency of @xmath3 610 hz , are observed in the intermediate state when the broad band noise suddenly disappears .",
    "these features quickly evolve into type - a qpos ( wijnands , homan & van der klis 1999 ) , which are broader and weaker .",
    "since the sudden suppression of the broad band noise hints a large physical change in the system , intermediate state observations displaying type - c qpos are classified as hard intermediate state ( hims ) and those displaying type - a or b qpos as soft intermediate state ( sims ) .",
    "additionally , a large radio flare , indicative of a jet ejection event , is often observed to be coincident with the onset of the sims ( fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) , although this is not always exact ( fender , belloni , & gallo 2005 ) . + the spectral and timing properties of bhbs can be described by _ the truncated disc model _",
    "( e.g. esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 ; done , gierliski & kubota 2007 ) where an optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disc which produces the multi - temperature blackbody spectral component ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) truncates at some radius , @xmath4 , larger than the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) . in the region between this truncation radius @xmath4 and an inner radius @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , accretion takes place via a hot , optically thin , geometrically thick accretion flow ( hereafter inner flow ) .",
    "compton up - scattering of cool disc photons by hot electrons in the flow produces the power low spectral component ( thorne & price 1975 ; sunyaev & truemper 1979 ) . in the hard state",
    "@xmath4 is large ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a gravitational radius ) , so only a small fraction of the disc photons illuminates the flow , giving rise to a weak direct disc component and hard power law emission . as the average mass accretion rate increases during the outburst",
    ", @xmath4 decreases , so more direct disc emission is seen and a greater luminosity of disc photons cool the flow , resulting in softer power law emission . when @xmath4 reaches the isco , the direct disc emission completely dominates the spectrum and the transition to the soft state is complete . + this scenario is the framework of the propagating fluctuations model propfluc ( ingram & done 2011 , 2012 , hereafter id11 , id12 ; ingram & van der klis 2013 , ik13 ) , a model that can reproduce power density spectra by combining the effects of the propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations in the inner flow ( lyubarskii 1997 ; arevalo & uttley 2006 ) , responsible for generating the broad band noise , with solid - body lense - thirring ( lt ) precession of this flow ( fragile et al . 2007 ; ingram , done & fragile 2009 ) , producing qpos .",
    "mass accretion rate fluctuations are generated throughout the inner flow , with the contribution to the rms variability from each region peaking at the local viscous frequency ( e.g. lyubarskii 1997 ; churazov , gilfanov & revnivtsev 2001 ; arevalo & uttley 2006 ) , thus the fast variability originates from the inner regions and the slow variability from the outer regions . as material is accreted , fluctuations propagate inwards , modulating the faster variability generated in the inner regions .",
    "emission is thus highly correlated from all regions of the flow , giving rise to the observed linear rms - flux relation ( uttley & mchardy 2001 ; uttley , vaughan & mchardy 2005 ) .",

    "+ we used the profluc model ( id11 ; id12 ; ik13 ) for fitting the power spectra of the first 5 observations in the 2.87 - 20.20 kev band . as described in ",
    "[ sec : int ] , the model assumes that the variability generated by each region of the inner flow peaks at the local viscous time scale .",
    "this is contrary to results of general relativistic magneto - hydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations , which display variability peaking approximately at the local _ orbital _",
    "timescale ( dexter & fragile 2011 ; armitage & reynolds 2003 ) .",
    "these simulations , however , disagree with observations since bhbs display a high frequency break in their power spectra at @xmath110 hz , whereas simulations assuming a @xmath111 black hole exhibit variability up to a high frequency break of @xmath112 hz , @xmath31/3 the orbital frequency at @xmath113 ( e.g. , fig .",
    "10 of dexter & fragile 2011 ) .",
    "the same discrepancy with simulations is seen for active galactic nuclei .",
    "for example , the power spectrum of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051 displays a break at @xmath114 hz ( vaughan et al .",
    "2011 ) , whereas the orbital frequency at @xmath113 is @xmath115 hz ( assuming a black hole mass of @xmath116 ) .",
    "while it is clearly important that this inconsistency is addressed , we note that assuming the characteristic variability timescale to be orbital rather than viscous would require an inner flow radius of @xmath117 in order to fit the observed power spectra in this paper .",
    "this strongly implies that considering the viscous timescale is more appropriate for black holes , even in light of evidence that pulsars show variability on the orbital timescale ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "+ in order to better explore the possibilities of the model , we ran a series of computations varying its physical parameters .",
    "the model parameter mainly affecting qpo frequency is the truncation radius @xmath4 , which sets the physical dimension of the precessing inner flow , responsible for the qpo generation . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : simul ] , most other parameters ( but not @xmath53 and @xmath67 ) also affect the qpo frequency .",
    "every parameter affects the broad band noise in a characteristic way .",
    "for example , varying the bending wave radius @xmath45 we observe evident correlated variations in peak frequency and slope of the high frequency tail of the broad band component , varying @xmath102 has almost no effect on the high frequency tail , but clearly changes its width and peak frequency , @xmath53 variations affect only the peak frequency .",
    "variations in black hole spin @xmath65 have no effect at all on the broad band component .",
    "it is clear that in order to constrain all physical parameters of the model , very good counting statistics are needed to clearly define the precise shape of the broad band noise . +",
    "in our fits we fixed @xmath103 , @xmath102 , @xmath50 , @xmath45 , the emission coefficient @xmath78 , black hole mass @xmath118 , and spin @xmath65 .",
    "fixing @xmath103 , @xmath102 , @xmath50 , and @xmath45 implies fixing the surface density profile throughout the rising phase of the outburst .",
    "id12 noticed that an evolution of @xmath45 is expected when the truncation radius decreases , because when the inner flow is illuminated by an increasing number of disc photons , its electron temperature drops and hence its scaleheight factor , @xmath63 , collapses . in our fit we fixed the bending wave radius because our spectra are too noisy above 10 hz to measure it independently , so we are not able to eliminate the degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath45 in determining the qpo frequency . for this reason we caution that the fit results in this work were obtained fixing the density profile of the inner flow ( except for @xmath4 ) , so that they must be interpreted with care .",
    "+ the qpo frequency increase over observations # 15 corresponds to an @xmath4 decrease from @xmath3 24 to @xmath3 10 @xmath55 .",
    "from spectral analysis , stiele et al .",
    "( 2012 ) report a constant truncation radius ( @xmath4 @xmath3 20 - 22 km ) throughout the whole outburst without specifying uncertainties . as described before",
    ", the profluc physical parameter mainly affecting the qpo frequency is @xmath4 , so that , in order to fit qpos during the rising phase of the outburst , the truncation radius has to vary during this phase . because of the data quality , rxte spectral range , and the limitations of the model used by stiele et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ( see merloni et al .",
    "2001 ) , the spectral estimation of the inner radius is of limited use in the comparison with the propfluc results . + the surface density normalization constant @xmath53 increases from @xmath3 3.5 to @xmath3 13.2 . for a given annulus in the inner flow , @xmath53 is proportional to surface density divided by mass accretion rate ( eq . [ eqn : sigma ] ) . during the rising phase of the outburst the mass accretion rate increases with time ,",
    "so the @xmath53 increase means that the surface density increases faster than the mass accretion rate , i.e. matter is accumulating in the flow during this phase of the outburst .",
    "this is consistent with the results of id12 on xte j1550 - 564 .",
    "+ the fractional variability @xmath67 shows a linear increasing trend in the first 3 observations and holds almost stable ( @xmath3 23@xmath23 ) in the other observations .",
    "the fractional variability does not give us any detailed information about the physical mechanisms producing the variability , but it quantifies the turbulent nature of the accreting material per radial decade .",
    "id12 show that @xmath67 increases continuously decreasing truncation radius , but we do not observe the same trend over all the observations , possibly because in our fit we fixed the bending wave radius . + as described , timing properties change in observations # 6 and # 7 , compared to observations # 15 , with simultaneous radio emission .",
    "the changes are more abrupt at higher photon energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsall ] ) .",
    "the rms decreases from @xmath3 18@xmath23 to @xmath3 7@xmath23 and @xmath32 frequency decreases as well , breaking the monotonically increasing trend of the first 5 observations .",
    "observations # 6 and # 7 also show a prominent low frequency broad band component ( @xmath119 ) that is not understandable in terms of the 2-component power spectra produced by profluc , which is the reason why we applied profluc only to the first 5 observations .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 1997 ) consider emptying and replenishing cycles of the inner accretion disc , caused by viscous thermal instability , to explain variability on timescale of tens of minutes in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "feroci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest material ejection to explain both spectral and timing properties of this same source , also in view of the correlation between the innermost disc temperature and the qpo frequency observed by muno et al .",
    "similarly , assuming the truncation radius reaches its smallest value at maximum luminosity ( and so maximum accretion rate ) , the @xmath90 decrease observed in our data can be explained by the depletion of inner flow material between @xmath5 and a certain radius @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) simultaneously to the radio emission .",
    "this scenario is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetm ] .",
    "this depletion can be caused by either ejection or increased accretion between @xmath5 and @xmath120 . as a consequence ,",
    "the surface density between @xmath5 and @xmath120 drops off , so that the high frequencies ( corresponding to smaller radii ) contribute less to the qpo frequency ( eq . [ eqn : fprec ] ) and @xmath67 ( so the noise level ) decreases .",
    "+ the low frequency broad band component @xmath119 might be explained in this scenario as the result of mass accretion rate fluctuations propagating from the disc towards the inner flow .",

    "we suggest that the source behavior in observation # 6 and # 7 , and so the transition between lhs and sims , might be caused by mass depletion in the innermost part of the accretion flow due to ejection and/or enhanced accretion associated with the simultaneous radio emission .",

    "<S> as shown in previous work , the source follows the standard evolution of a black hole outburst . during the rising phase of the outburst we detect an abrupt change in timing behavior associated with the occurrence of a type - b quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) . </S>",
    "<S> this qpo and the simultaneously detected radio emission mark the transition between hard and soft intermediate state . </S>",
    "<S> we fit power spectra from the rising phase of the outburst using the recently proposed model propfluc . </S>",
    "<S> this assumes a truncated disc / hot inner flow geometry , with mass accretion rate fluctuations propagating through a precessing inner flow . </S>",
    "<S> we link the propfluc physical parameters to the phenomenological multi - lorentzian fit parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the physical parameter dominating the qpo frequency is the truncation radius , while broad band noise characteristics are also influenced by the radial surface density and emissivity profiles of the flow . in the outburst rise we found that the truncation radius decreases from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , and the surface density increases faster than the mass accretion rate , as previously reported for xte j1550 - 564 . </S>",
    "<S> two soft intermediate state observations could not be fitted with propfluc , and we suggest that they are coincident with the ejection of material from the inner regions of the flow in a jet or accretion of these regions into the bh horizon , explaining the drop in qpo frequency and suppression of broad band variability preferentially at high energy bands coincident with a radio flare .    </S>",
