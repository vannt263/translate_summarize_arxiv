    "the mean field approximation is the backbone of many - body calculations in nuclear physics , either as a zero order approach to the problem or as a basis for more elaborated theories like the random - phase approximation or the generator coordinate method .",
    "the modern and fast computer facilities have made possible the use of effective density dependent interactions , as the skyrme @xcite or the gogny force @xcite , in standard mean field calculations like the hartree - fock ( hf ) or the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approaches .    in spite of the relative simplicity of the mean field approach , some additional approximations have been commonly used when effective forces were used in the mean field calculations in order to make the problem more tractable .",
    "the complications in the calculations usually arise from the exchange terms , either from the coulomb force or from some components of the nuclear force itself . depending on the mean field approach ( hf or hfb ) and on the force ( zero or finite range ) different approximations",
    "have been used in the past . in the hf theory one",
    "has only one exchange term ( the fock term ) which contributes to the hf field .",
    "commonly , in this type of calculations , in order to retain the required simplicity of the model , the fock term of the coulomb force has been neglected , or treated in the slater approximation . in ref .",
    "@xcite the validity of different approaches for the coulomb fock contribution was tested in hf calculations finding the slater approximation a good one . in the hfb approach , and for any two - body interaction",
    ", one has two exchange terms , the fock term which contributes to the hf field and the particle - particle ( _ pp _ ) term which contributes to the pairing field . in the hfb approach",
    "one must distinguish between the skyrme and the gogny force . since the skyrme force is assumed to provide only the particle - hole ( _ ph _ ) part of the force , all terms of the _ pp _ type are neglected even those arising from the coulomb force . with the gogny force",
    "the situation is different because with its finite range it has been designed to provide both , the _ ph _ and the _ pp _ part of the nuclear force .    a test similar to the one performed for hf in ref .",
    "@xcite has never been done for hfb calculations .",
    "exact hfb calculations with the gogny force have been performed for spherical nuclei @xcite , but the effects of the approximation of neglecting the exchange terms never have been analyzed .",
    "for the more complex triaxial hfb calculations it has been assumed that the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite for the hf approach , concerning the exchange terms , will also apply to this case .",
    "this point , however , never has been checked .",
    "hfb calculations with triaxial symmetry using density ",
    "dependent interactions like the gogny force , used by different groups  @xcite , are usually performed using the following approximations :    * first , the contributions to the pairing field stemming from the center of mass correction , coulomb and spin  orbit terms are neglected .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that their contribution , in the limit of axial deformations , is assumed ( but not proved ) to be negligible small  @xcite .",
    "thus , under these conditions the pairing field arises only from the brink  boeker term . *",
    "second , since the exchange ( fock ) coulomb term contribution to the hf field requires a large cpu time , its contribution to the energy is not taken into account or it is included in the slater approximation .    on the other hand in the hfb theory",
    ", pairing is an important degree of freedom and it is important to analyze how the properties related to this part of the field change when some approximations are assumed . in this paper , for the first time , we calculate in the triaxial basis the contributions mentioned above .",
    "we shall investigate the effect of including all the terms in the fields as compared with the calculations which are normally done for deformed nuclei .",

    "we use the basis q@xmath69 , p@xmath70 and n@xmath71 and the d1s interaction . taking into account the results obtained in the other regions",
    ", we do not expect a big influence of the coulomb exchange terms because for the superdeformed states the proton pairing energies either vanish or are very small even with the hfb@xmath40 method .",
    "a large change of the pairing energies due to the coulomb exchange and the other terms can not exist , therefore , in this states . as an example of superdeformation we have chosen the nucleus . from this example",
    "we will learn how the other pairing contributions ( spin  orbit and two  body correction ) affect the neutron pairing energies and the other nuclear properties through the selfconsistency .",
    "as before , we shall first look for the wave function content of the hfb@xmath40 and the hfb@xmath72 approaches . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hg ] , panel ( a ) , we can see the behavior of the pairing energies in both methods . as mentioned ,",

    "the charge quadrupole moment is depicted in panel ( b ) .",
    "only small differences between both approaches are found at large angular momentum .",
    "the gyromagnetic factors , panel ( c ) , are again very close to each other .",

    "for these observables we do not find remarkable differences between the three approaches .    from this section",
    "we may conclude that the coulomb exchange and pairing contribution barely modify the properties of the nucleus when the approximate calculation hfb@xmath40 has vanishing proton pairing energies .",
    "then , the approach hfb@xmath40 is a good approximation to the completely self  consistent calculation , hfb@xmath72 , even for the wave function .",
    "in this section we shall finally investigate the effect of the exchange terms as a function of a collective variable at zero angular momentum .",
    "we have used an axially symmetric hfb code that allows reflexion asymmetric shapes .",
    "we have performed two different calculation . in the first one we have neglected all exchange terms , i.e. , the hfb@xmath40 approach , but we have included , the fock coulomb term in the slater approximation , we shall call this approach hfb@xmath74 .",
    "the second approach includes all exchange terms with the exception of the contribution of the spin - orbit term to the pairing field , we shall call this approach hfb@xmath75 .",
    "notice that since we do not add at the end of the calculation hfb@xmath74 the pairing terms of the coulomb and the two - body kinetic energy ( both contributions are repulsive ) it is possible to find hfb@xmath74 solutions with an energy deeper than the hfb@xmath75 approach .",
    "that means we are more interested in the general behavior of the energy surface than in the absolute values .",
    "the most common case of energy dependence as a function of a collective variable appears in the calculation of fission barriers . in this",

    "we shall now investigate the effect of the exchange terms in cases where the reflexion symmetry is broken i.e. the wave functions do not have a good parity . in these calculations",

    "the depth and shape of the octupole deformed minimum are almost identical in both approaches . in panel d ) , finally , we present the dipole moment versus the constrained octupole momentum .",
    "again , small differences between both calculations are found but without further relevance .",
    "the main outcome of our investigation is that the exchange terms usually neglected affect mainly the nuclear pairing properties .",
    "more specifically , they affect mostly the _ proton _ nuclear pairing properties because of all missing terms the largest contribution to the pairing field arises from the coulomb potential .",
    "observables little or not dependent on the pairing correlations , are , therefore , not affected by these terms . on the contrary , observables like the moments of inertia or two - quasiparticle states energies , strongly dependent on pairing correlations , are very sensitive to these terms .",
    "we have found that the results of calculations performed with the plain hfb@xmath40 approximation differ significantly , for some observables , from those of the exact solution hfb@xmath72 , in nuclei where the proton pairing energies are relatively large . on the contrary ,",
    "the hfb@xmath43 results agree , in general , very well with those of the exact solution . in cases of very small proton correlation energies",
    "all three approaches , hfb@xmath40 , hfb@xmath43 and hfb@xmath72 practically coincide .    for those situations where proton correlations are relevant",
    ", the predictions of the hfb@xmath40 approximation agree better with the experimental data than the exact ones or than the ones from the hfb@xmath43 approximation .",
    "paradoxically , the gogny force was fitted @xcite using the _ exact _ hfb approach to calculate properties of spherical nuclei .",
    "the pairing properties of the gogny force were adjusted by fitting the odd - even mass difference of the @xmath79 isotones .",
    "the @xmath79 isotones , however , have a major shell closure in protons , z@xmath1 , and in this case , practically , it does not matter whether one performs approximate or exact calculations , i.e. , effectively the coulomb exchange terms were not considered in this fit .",
    "furthermore , the fact that including the exchange terms in the calculations worsens the good agreement of the theoretical results with the experimental data , reinforces the conjecture that the actual fits of the gogny force should be used , in calculations with open proton shells , without the mentioned terms .    of course the gogny force is isospin invariant but the coulomb force is not .",
    "the hartree - fock potential that one obtains after solving the hfb equations neither is isospin invariant .",
    "it is not clear , therefore , that a different parameterization ( concerning the pairing part of the interaction ) of the force would not be obtained if nuclei with open proton shells had been considered in the fit .",
    "the whole issue of adjusting the pairing properties of any force is itself rather fuzzy .",
    "most of the fits have been done to reproduce the experimentally observed odd - even mass difference .",
    "this energy difference can , however , not be attributed only to pairing correlations @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the calculation of this energy difference presents also problems because binding energies of odd nuclei are not easy to calculate .",
    "blocking effects and angular momentum projection should be performed in order to evaluate properly this energy , besides additional couplings . however , in order to save cpu time during the fit , approximations are used , in particular in order not to break the time reversal symmetry the equal filling approximation is used .",
    "taking into account the complication of the neglected exchange terms , see appendix  b , the fact that the hfb@xmath40 approximation , commonly used in most hfb calculations , provides such good agreement with the experimental data is very fortunate .",
    "for the first time we have performed an exact self  consistent hfb calculation in a triaxial basis with the gogny force . the exact coulomb exchange term and the contributions of the spin ",
    "orbit , two ",
    "body correction of the kinetic energy and coulomb terms to the pairing field have been included in the calculations .",
    "an exhaustive analysis of each term has been performed for spherical nuclei in different mass regions .",
    "we find the coulomb contribution to the pairing field to be the most relevant one .",
    "the other terms , though not negligible , give smaller contributions .    for deformed nuclei we have studied the commonly used hfb@xmath40 approximation , the perturbative hfb@xmath43 , and the exact solution .",
    "we have been concerned with different mass regions at zero and high spins . as in the case of spherical nuclei , we observe a reduction of the proton pairing energies in the exact calculations as compared to the hfb@xmath40 ones .",
    "ground state energies are very similar in the perturbative and in the exact calculations .",
    "energies of excited states are somewhat different in the hfb@xmath40 approximation than in the exact one",
    ". we have also investigated superdeformed states .",
    "since the proton pairing correlations of these nuclei are small we do not find any significant difference between the approximate and the exact solution .",
    "lastly , we have analyzed the effect of the most relevant exchange terms in the calculation of energy surfaces .",
    "the energy as a function of the quadrupole ( octupole ) mass operator is practically identical in the approximate and in the exact calculations .        1 .   in cases where the proton pairing correlations do not play an important role , anyone of the approximations considered",
    "practically coincide with the exact calculation .",
    "when proton pairing correlations are relevant , then : * for energy - related observables the perturbative approach hfb@xmath43 is a good approximation to the exact one .",
    "* for those observables whose evaluation requires the wave functions , one should perform the exact calculation . *",
    "if the hfb wave functions are thought as a basis for more elaborated theories , like rpa or gcm , then the exact calculation is required .",

    "in the numerical computation of the coulomb exchange and pairing terms we have used 20 points for the gauss - legendre integration .",
    "this number of points has proven to be enough for a precise determination of the exchange field and pairing tensor .",
    "the number of integration points used makes the evaluation of the coulomb terms rather costly in terms of cpu time : it usually takes a factor 5.5 longer to compute those factors than to calculate the fock and pairing parts of the brink - boecker interaction ( in this case , we have two gaussians and we have to compute them for both protons and neutrons ) .",
    "the calculation of the exchange and pairing parts of the bb interaction is already the most costly part of each iteration as it usually takes between a factor 10 and 15 longer than the evaluation of the direct terms . in a standard workstation and for a configuration space with parameters @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 the evaluation of the direct field takes 1.9 seconds , the combined fock and pairing terms of the bb part takes 19 seconds and the evaluation of the fock and pairing parts of the coulomb interaction takes 103 seconds .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the previous numbers are for each iteration of the minimization process .",
    "if we increase the size of the basis by using @xmath102 and @xmath103 the previous numbers climb up to 7 , 92 and 540 seconds respectively .",
    "we clearly see the tremendous slow down introduced in the calculations stemming from the consideration of the fock and pairing terms of the coulomb interaction .",
    "this tremendous slow down can be even worse for the practitioners of the skyrme interaction as their cpu time consumption per iteration has to be of the order of the one needed to calculate the direct field of the gogny force .    concerning the computation of the pairing field associated to the spin - orbit interaction we have followed the ideas already presented in @xcite .",
