    "the second recorded outburst of ci aquilae was discovered in april 2000 by @xcite since the first recorded outburst in 1917 @xcite .",
    "thus , ci aql has been recognized as a member of the recurrent novae @xcite .",
    "after optical brightness reached its maximum @xmath5 in early may 2000 , it rapidly decreased to @xmath6 in about 50 days .",
    "a plateau phase follows ; the brightness levelled off at @xmath7 .",
    "ci aql is still as bright as @xmath8 until now about 300 days after maximum , being the longest record of on - time among the recurrent novae ( e.g. , vsnet archives , http://www.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/ ) .",
    "recurrent novae constitute a small class of cataclysmic variables , the outbursts of which repeat in a decade to a century .",
    "ejecta of the recurrent novae are not metal - enriched but similar to the solar value ( @xmath9 ) , indicating that the wds in the recurrent novae are not eroded but have grown in mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "masses of white dwarfs ( wds ) in the recurrent novae are estimated to be so massive as the chandrasekhar mass limit from the light curve fitting ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these features strongly suggest that the recurrent novae are an immediate progenitor of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) if the wd consists of carbon and oxygen @xcite .",
    "evolutionary paths to sne ia via recurrent novae have been pointed out by @xcite .",
    "recurrent novae are divided into three subclasses depending on their orbital periods : t pyx subclass with a dwarf companion , u sco subclass with a slightly evolved main - sequence ( ms ) or subgiant companion , and rs oph subclass with a red giant companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ci aql has an orbital period of 0.618 days , belonging to the u sco subclass .",
    "it is therefore likely that the light curve of ci aql develops like u sco .",
    "the 1999 outburst of u sco was densely observed from the rising phase to the final decay phase through the mid - plateau phase .",
    "the detection of supersoft x - rays during the plateau phase @xcite strongly supports the theoretical description of nova outbursts  massive wind phase , steady hydrogen burning phase ( no winds ) , and final cooling phase ,  which corresponds to the rapid decline , plateau , and final decline phases in the light curve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , respectively .",
    "because the development of ci aql outbursts is much slower than that of u sco , there is still a chance to observe supersoft x - rays .",
    "supersoft x - rays are direct evidence of hydrogen shell burning on a wd so that they provide us valuable information on recurrent novae and sn ia progenitors .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we determine the mass and the growth rate of the wd as accurately as possible by theoretically analyzing light curves .",
    "then , ( 1 ) we predict the turn - off time of nuclear burning and the duration of supersoft x - ray source ( sss ) phase of the present outburst and ( 2 ) examine the possibility whether or not ci aql will explode as an sn ia . in  2 , we describe our model of ci aql in quiescence and estimate the inclination angle , the size and thickness of the accretion disk , and so on . in",
    " 3 , the 1917 outburst is numerically analyzed and we determine the mass of the wd . in  4 , the 2000 outburst is also numerically analyzed and the duration of wind is estimated . in  5 , we predict the duration of the sss phase .",
    "discussion follows in  6 .",
    "ci aql is an eclipsing binary .",
    "we have considered a binary model as illustrated in figure [ ciaql_quiescence_config ] which consists of ( 1 ) the wd photosphere , ( 2 ) the ms photosphere which fills its roche lobe , and ( 3 ) the accretion disk ( acdk ) .",
    "we assume that the size and thickness of the acdk are given by two parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the outer edge of the acdk , @xmath15 the effective radius of the inner critical roche lobe for the wd component , and @xmath16 the height of the surface from the equatorial plane , @xmath17 the distance on the equatorial plane from the center of the wd . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath17-square law ( @xmath18 ) to mimic the effect of flaring - up at the rim of the acdk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the accretion luminosity of the wd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the viscous luminosity of the acdk , and the irradiations by the wd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also included . here",
    ", we assume that the surfaces of the ms and of the acdk emit photons as a black - body at a local temperature of each surface patch area ( see fig .",
    "[ ciaql_quiescence_config ] ) which is heated by radiation from the wd .",
    "the efficiencies of irradiation of the ms and of the acdk are assumed to be @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the numerical method is essentially the same as that in @xcite and fully described in @xcite . a circular orbit is assumed .",
    "light curves of ci aql in quiescence has been obtained by @xcite .",
    "they determined the orbital period and ephemeris to be jd 2,448,412.167(25 ) + 0.618355@xmath21 at eclipse minima .",
    "figure [ vmag_quiescence ] shows the averaged ( smoothed ) observational points ( open circles ) together with our calculated @xmath22 light curves for the suggested wd mass of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and mass accretion rate of @xmath25 yr@xmath4 ( see the following sections ) . to fit our theoretical light curves with the observational points , we have calculated @xmath22 light curves by changing the parameters of @xmath261.0 by 0.1 step , @xmath270.50 by 0.05 step , @xmath288000 k by 100 k step ,",
    "@xmath296000 k by 500 k step , and @xmath30@xmath31 by @xmath32 step and seek for the best - fit model by minimizing rms of the residuals .",
    "the light curves are also calculated for four companion masses of @xmath33 , 1.1 , 1.5 and @xmath34 .",
    "since we obtain similar light curves for all of these four cases , we adopt @xmath35 because the mass transfer is as high as @xmath36 yr@xmath4 and this indicates a thermally unstable mass transfer @xcite , which requires @xmath37 @xcite . a 1.5 @xmath38 ms expands to fill the roche lobe of @xmath39 after a large part of hydrogen at the center is consumed ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) .    in the best - fit model ,",
    "a rather blue color index of @xmath40 is obtained as shown in figure [ color_quiescence ] .",
    "this suggests a large color excess of @xmath41 with the observed color of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this color excess is very consistent with @xmath43 estimated by @xcite .",
    "first we reproduce the light curve of the 1917 outburst .",
    "its tycho @xmath44 magnitude light curve has recently been reported by @xcite , which is shown in figure [ bmag_mmix_ciaql1917 ] together with our calculated @xmath44 light curves .",
    "our numerical method for calculating light curves is fully described in @xcite .",
    "it has been established that the wd photosphere expands to a giant size at the optical maximum in nova outbursts .",
    "since the separation of ci aql is @xmath45 @xcite , the wd envelope engulfs the ms companion so that the early phase light curve is calculated only from the wd photosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the accretion disk and",
    "the companion do not contribute to the @xmath44 light until it decreases to @xmath46 mag .",
    "we determine the wd mass to be @xmath1 from the early phase light curve as seen in figure [ bmag_mmix_ciaql1917 ] .",
    "assuming @xmath47 , we estimate the envelope mass at the optical maximum to be @xmath48 for the hydrogen content @xmath49 .",
    "if the duration of quiescence before the 1917 outburst is almost the same as the quiescent phase between the 1917 and 2000 outburst , this envelope mass indicates a mass accretion rate of @xmath50 yr@xmath4 if no wd matter has been dredged up . in our wind model ,",
    "about 81% ( @xmath51 ) of the envelope mass has been blown in the wind while the residual 19% ( @xmath52 ) has been left and added to the helium layer of the wd .",
    "the net mass - increasing rate of the wd is @xmath53 yr@xmath4 .",
    "thus , ci aql may become an sn ia if the donor is massive enough .",
    "ci aql bursted in april 2000 .",
    "its optical maximum ( @xmath5 mag ) was reached on may 5 , 2000 ( hjd 2451669.5 , * ? ? ?",
    "as shown in figure [ vmag_irradmix_ciaql00 ] , the visual brightness quickly decreased to 13.5 mag in about 60 days .",
    "then , it stays at @xmath8 mag , i.e. , a plateau phase .",
    "this mid - plateau phase is very similar to that of u sco and can also be explained by the irradiation of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have reproduced the light curve in the plateau phase by assuming similar model parameters to those of u sco .",
    "theoretical light curves in figure [ vmag_irradmix_ciaql00 ] are calculated for a pair of @xmath54 wd @xmath55 @xmath56 ms . in the plateau phase of the light curve , i.e. ,",
    "when the wd photosphere becomes much smaller than the binary size , the light curve is determined mainly by the irradiations of the acdk and of the ms .",
    "the unheated surface temperatures are fixed to be @xmath57 k for the ms and to be @xmath58 k at the disk rim , which are the same as the basic model in quiescence .",
    "the luminosity of the accretion disk depends on both the thickness @xmath11 and the size @xmath10 .",
    "we have examined a total of 160 cases for the set of @xmath59 , which is the product of 16 cases of @xmath60 0.52.0 by 0.1 step and 10 cases of @xmath61 0.050.50 by 0.05 step . here , we have adopted a set of @xmath62 and @xmath63 during the wind phase and a set of @xmath64 and @xmath63 after the wind stopped .",
    "the decline of the early phase ( @xmath6570 days ) hardly depends on the hydrogen content @xmath66 of the wd envelope but the ends of the wind phase and of the hydrogen shell - burning phase depend sensitively on the hydrogen content @xmath66 as shown in figure [ vmag_irradmix_ciaql00 ] .",
    "@xcite reported a sharp @xmath67 mag drop of @xmath68 magnitude in late november 2000 and kiyota ( vsnet archives ) also observed a @xmath69 mag drop of @xmath70 magnitude as shown in figure [ vmag_irradmix_ciaql00 ] .",
    "if we attribute this drop to the end of wind phase , the hydrogen content is somewhere between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , more closer to @xmath72 .",
    "we here adopt @xmath72 . in the case of @xmath72 , the continuous wind stopped in early december 2000",
    "about 220 days after maximum and the steady hydrogen shell - burning will end in early august 2001 about 450 days after maximum as shown in figure [ vmag_irradmix_ciaql00 ] .",
    "we here strongly encourage x - ray observations until the mid august 2001 , that is , the end of steady hydrogen shell - burning . no supersoft x - rays are observed in the early decline phase because the photospheric radius of the wd is rather large and the photospheric temperature is relatively low . after the recurrent nova enters the plateau phase , the photospheric temperature of the wd increases to high enough to emit supersoft x - rays . during the massive wind phase , however , we do not expect supersoft x - rays because they are self - absorbed by the wind itself .",
    "u sco was observed as a luminous supersoft x - ray source in the mid - plateau phase of the 1999 outburst just after the massive wind stopped @xcite .",
    "our analysis suggests that the massive wind stopped in early december 2000 and that supersoft x - rays are now very likely detectable until august 2001 .",
    "the calculated distance modulus of the 1917 outburst is about @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the distance to ci aql is estimated to be 1.6 kpc for the reddening of @xmath74 and the absorption of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the apparent distance modulus of @xmath77 from the 2000 outburst as shown in figure [ vmag_irradmix_ciaql00 ] is also consistent with the distance of 1.6 kpc and @xmath76 .",
    "on the other hand , we obtain an apparent distance modulus of @xmath78 in the quiescent phase as shown in figure [ vmag_quiescence ] , which corresponds to the distance of 1.1 kpc .",
    "this is not consistent with our estimation from the outburst light curves . to examine this difference",
    ", we check other observations and found that three others indicate @xmath79 in quiescence , which is 0.7 mag darker than @xmath80 in figure 1 of mennickent & honeycutt ( see table 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath22 magnitudes in their figure 1 were obtained with a fully automated telescope and the errors in the zero point ( formally 0.2 mag as in their text ) could be larger than expected ( private communication with mennickent ) .",
    "if we adopt @xmath81 in quiescence , then the distance modulus is @xmath82 and the distance to ci aql becomes @xmath83 kpc , being consistent with the distance estimate from the outbursts .",
    "thus , we determine the distance to ci aql to be @xmath84 kpc with @xmath85 .",
    "the lacks of flickering and of balmer emission lines in quiescence lead @xcite to conclude that ci aql is not interacting at least at the present time .",
    "however , the inner part of the accretion disk can not be seen from the earth as easily understood from figure [ ciaql_quiescence_config ] .",
    "this is the reason for the lacks of emission lines and of flickering even when the system includes a mass - accreting wd .",
    "this is essentially the same situation as in u sco @xcite .",
    "we are very grateful to the vsnet members who observed ci aql and sent their valuable data to the vsnet .",
    "we also thank r. mennickent for his comment on their photometry and the anonymous referee for many kind comments that help us to improve the manuscript .",
