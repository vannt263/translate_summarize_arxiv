    "the aslamazov - larkin correction is known to have a power - law singularity near the critical temperature .",
    "one of the main features is the dependence of the power exponent on the dimensionality @xmath35 of the superconductor , namely , @xmath36 .",
    "another peculiarity is the sensitivity of @xmath15 to weak magnetic field , which destroys non - equilibrium cooper pairs and changes the critical temperature of superconductor .",
    "the presence of magnetic field however does not affect the power exponent of @xmath37 in the very vicinity of the critical temperature .",
    "thus this exponent is a fundamental value , which reflects the number of degrees of freedom for fluctuating cooper pairs .",
    "note also that for spatially homogeneous superconducting systems the energy spectrum of fluctuating cooper pairs is isotropic in the momentum space .",
    "this results in isotropy of the aslamazov - larkin correction to the conductivity .    at the same time",
    "there are a lot of systems where the superconductivity nucleation is essentially anisotropic , i.e. superconductivity appears not in the whole sample but in spatially localized regions . in particular , in three - dimensional finite superconductors placed into a uniform magnetic field @xmath38 , which is parallel to the samples edge , the conditions for the superconducting nucleation near the edge are more favorable compared with the bulk .",
    "this results in the effect of surface superconductivity.@xcite    a similar type of localized superconductivity appears in superconductors with twinning planes , where even without external magnetic field the local enhancement of the critical temperature near twins takes place ( see ref .   for review ) . as a result , in certain temperature",

    "such systems attract growing attention in connection with the possibility to govern transport properties of the s subsystem by manipulating the domain structure of ferromagnet ( see , e.g. , ref .   for review ) .",
    "nucleation of superconducting state in these systems is strongly affected by magnitude and spatial configuration of inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "it is interesting that for certain parameters of the system the superconductivity can arise in the form of separated one - dimensional nuclei which are localized near the domain walls or inside the domain regions @xcite .",
    "the experimental evidence of this effect is presented in refs .  .",
    "it is interesting that the presence of localized superconducting states can substantially change the transport properties of the superconductors even above @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , schmidt and mikeska@xcite analyzed the fluctuation conductivity of a finite - size superconductor placed into a magnetic field , which is parallel to the samples edge .",
    "they showed that in this system in the very vicinity of the superconducting transition the temperature dependence of the aslamazov - larkin correction becomes two - dimensional , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "this corresponds to the formation of a narrow two - dimensional channel with enhanced fluctuation conductivity , which is localized near the surface .",
    "later thompson found that the fluctuation conductivity is anisotropic in the plane of the film due to anisotropy of the effective mass tensor in the spectrum of fluctuating cooper pairs.@xcite also he predicted a peculiar dependence of @xmath15 on the magnetic field near the tricritical point , where one of the effective mass components changes its sign .",
    "a similar situation is realized in the vicinity of the transition from uniform to the spatially modulated fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov superconducting state.@xcite . in this case",
    "the effective mass in the energy spectrum of the fluctuating cooper pairs becomes negative and a rich variety of different fluctuation regimes with different critical exponents of the fluctuation conductivity is expected .",
    "the effect of the boundary conditions on the anisotropy of @xmath15 for a superconductor in the magnetic field , which is parallel to its surface , was analyzed by imry@xcite .",
    "also the unusual temperature behavior of @xmath15 was predicted for a finite superconducting film placed into a perpendicular magnetic field.@xcite in this case near @xmath8 the fluctuation conductivity reveals a one - dimensional behavior due to edge states , i.e. @xmath40 .    a similar anisotropy of fluctuations - dependent quantities appears in the superconductors with twinning planes.@xcite it was shown that if such superconductor is placed into a magnetic field which is perpendicular to the twinning planes then the magnetic susceptibility near the critical temperature has a two - dimensional singularity which is strongly than a three - dimensional one .",
    "at the same time , for a longitudinal magnetic field the contribution from the twinning planes to the magnetic susceptibility is negligibly small since the electron motion is appressed to the twins and its experimental observation is very complicated since it is masked by the bulk contribution .    in the present paper",

    "the magnitude of @xmath15 anisotropy also increases and at @xmath47 the energy spectrum changes qualitatively : the effective mass corresponding to the momentum @xmath48 along the domain walls changes its sign and two minima of the energy spectrum at non - zero @xmath48 appear .",
