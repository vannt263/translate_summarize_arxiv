    "the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) is one of the most mysterious problems in particle physics and cosmology , since the minimal standard model ( msm ) and the big bang cosmology can not answer it .",
    "so far various mechanisms for generating bau have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "one promising possibility is the so - called leptogenesis scenario  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where the origins of neutrino masses as well as bau can be addressed at the same time by introducing right - handed neutrinos with superheavy majorana masses .",
    "the observed tiny masses of neutrinos can be naturally understood by the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "further , the lepton asymmetry generated by decays of right - handed neutrinos can be a source of bau . in the simplest thermal leptogenesis ,",
    "the required majorana masses is heavier than about @xmath5 gev  @xcite .",
    "it should be , however , noted that the connection between the origins of neutrino masses and bau can be obtained even when majorana masses are below the weak scale .",
    "one interesting possibility is the so - called @xmath0msm  @xcite , which is the msm extended by three right - handed neutrinos with masses smaller than the weak scale . in this model",
    "the problems of neutrino masses , bau and also dark matter can be solved simultaneously .",
    "one attractive advantage of the @xmath0msm lies in the fact that the direct detection of right - handed neutrinos becomes possible  @xcite .    in the @xmath0msm bau",
    "can be generated by invoking the mechanism via flavour oscillation of right - handed neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in this mechanism the lepton asymmetry is not generated for temperatures of interest because of the smallness of majorana masses , which is very different from the leptogenesis scenario .",
    "the lepton asymmetry is separated into left - handed and right - handed leptonic sectors due to the cp violations in the production and oscillation of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "then , the asymmetry stored in the left - handed sector is partially transferred into the baryon asymmetry through the rapid sphaleron transitions  @xcite .",
    "one of right - handed neutrinos in the @xmath0msm , which is a candidate of dark matter , plays no essential role to generate bau as well as neutrino masses observed in the oscillation experiments , since its yukawa coupling constants should be very suppressed .",
    "the rest two are responsible to bau via their flavour oscillation , but also induce the masses of active neutrinos through the seesaw mechanism .",
    "therefore , physics of these two right - handed neutrinos connects bau with the neutrino parameters of active neutrinos , _",
    "i.e. _ , mass hierarchy , mixing angles , and cp violating phases .    in this letter",
    "we would like to extend the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite . under the considering situation",
    "there are three cp violating phases in the leptonic sector which can be a source of the asymmetry . especially , we concentrate here on the case when bau is originated only from the cp violation in the mixing matrix @xmath6 of active neutrinos , namely , the dirac phase @xmath7 and majorana phase @xmath8 in @xmath6 .",
    "we then present the analytical expression of bau shows explicitly how bau depends on these cp phases and the mixing angles of active neutrinos .",
    "moreover , we also perform the numerical estimation of bau and justify the validity of the analytical expression .",
    "we begin with the brief review of the model under consideration , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath0msm  @xcite .",
    "it is the msm extended by three right - handed neutrinos @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , which lagrangian is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the msm lagrangian .",
    "@xmath13 are neutrino yukawa couplings , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are higgs and lepton weak - doublets , respectively .",
    "the majorana masses of right - handed neutrinos are denoted by @xmath17 which are taken to be real and positive without loss of generality . here and",
    "hereafter we work in a basis in which the mass matrix of charged leptons is diagonal . in this model ,",
    "neutrinos also obtain the dirac masses , @xmath18_{\\alpha i } = f_{\\alpha i } { { \\langle \\phi \\rangle}}$ ] ( @xmath19 is a vacuum expectation value of the higgs field ) , after the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking .    the distinctive feature of the model is the region of the parameter space of eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_numsm ] ) , _ i.e. _ , we restrict ourselves in the region @xmath20_{\\alpha i } \\right| \\ll m_i \\lesssim 100 \\,\\mbox{gev } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case the seesaw mechanism works , and mass eigenstates of neutrinos are then divided into two groups .",
    "one group consists of active neutrinos @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "their masses are found from the seesaw mass matrix @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath6 is the mixing matrix of active neutrinos .",
    "the other one consists of sterile neutrinos @xmath25 which are almost the right - handed states @xmath26 , and their masses are approximately given by the majorana masses @xmath17 .",
    "we then find the neutrino mixing as @xmath27 where @xmath28_{\\alpha i}/m_i$ ] are the active - sterile ( left - right ) mixing matrix .",
    "we should stress that sterile neutrinos @xmath25 here are originated from the right - handed neutrinos in the seesaw mechanism .",
    "thus , we simply say @xmath25 as right - handed neutrinos from now on .    in the @xmath0msm three right - handed neutrinos play important roles in cosmology .",
    "one of them , say @xmath29 , is a candidate for dark matter of the universe  @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present work to describe this issue .",
    "however , one thing being important for later discussions is that the yukawa couplings of @xmath29 should be highly suppressed to realise a successful dark matter scenario .",
    "( see the details , _",

    "the other right - handed neutrinos , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are then responsible to the masses and mixing angles of active neutrinos .",
    "notice that the lightest active neutrino becomes massless in our approximation .",
    "further , the flavour oscillation between @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the early universe can be a source of bau through the mechanism proposed in ref .",

    "we concentrate on the case in which bau is originated solely from the cp phases in the mixing matrix of active neutrinos , and find the dependence on @xmath7 and @xmath8 as well as the mixing angles @xmath54 by taking @xmath55 . on bau",
