    "the riemannian positive mass theorem states that an asymptotically flat riemannian manifold @xmath1 with nonnegative scalar curvature has nonnegative adm mass , and that the adm mass is strictly positive unless @xmath1 is isometric to flat @xmath0 .",
    "the theorem was first proved in 1979 by schoen and yau @xcite for manifolds of dimension @xmath2 using minimal surface techniques .",
    "witten @xcite later proved the theorem for spin manifolds of any dimension using spinors and the dirac operator .",
    "the penrose inequality can be viewed as a generalization of the positive mass theorem in the presence of an area outer minimizing horizon .",
    "a horizon is simply a minimal surface , and we say that it is area outer minimizing if every other surface which encloses it has greater area .",
    "when an asymptotically flat riemannian manifold @xmath1 with nonnegative scalar curvature contains an area outer minimizing horizon @xmath3 , the riemannian penrose inequality gives a lower bound for the adm mass @xmath4 in terms of the @xmath5 volume @xmath6 of @xmath3 and the volume @xmath7 of the unit @xmath5 sphere : @xmath8 with equality if and only if @xmath1 is isometric to a schwarzschild metric .",
    "this inequality was first proved in dimension @xmath9 by huisken and illmanen @xcite in 1997 for the case of a single horizon using inverse mean curvature flow , a method originally proposed by geroch @xcite , jang and wald @xcite . in 1999 , bray @xcite extended this result to the general case of a horizon with multiple components using a conformal flow of metrics .",
    "note that in dimension three , the riemannian penrose inequality is @xmath10 .",
    "later , bray and lee @xcite generalized bray s proof for dimensions @xmath2 , with the extra requirement that @xmath11 be spin for the rigidity statement . to the author",
    "s knowledge , there are no known proofs of the riemannian penrose inequality in dimensions @xmath12 other than in the spherically symmetric cases .    the case of equality of the riemannian penrose inequality is attained by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "it is conformal to @xmath13 and may be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath4 is a positive constant and @xmath15 is the flat euclidean metric .",
    "moreover , when @xmath9 , the schwarzschild metric @xmath16 can also be isometrically embedded as a rotating parabola in @xmath17 as the set of points @xmath18 satisfying @xmath19 :     ( in blue ) viewed as a spherically symmetric submanifold of four dimensional euclidean space @xmath20 satisfying @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "figure courtesy of hubert bray.[positiveschwarzschild],width=453 ]    solving for @xmath23 , we see that the end of the three dimensional schwarzschild metric containing infinity , called the outer end , is the graph of the spherically symmetric function @xmath24 given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 . in this case",
    ", one can check directly that the adm mass of @xmath27 is the positive constant @xmath4 by computing a certain boundary integral at infinity involving the function @xmath28 .    that an end of the three dimensional schwarzschild metric can be isometrically embedded in @xmath17 as the graph of a function over @xmath29 raises the following questions : if @xmath30 is a bounded open set in @xmath0 and @xmath28 is a smooth function on @xmath31 such that the graph of @xmath28 is an asymptotically flat manifold @xmath11 with nonnegative scalar curvature @xmath32 and horizon @xmath33 , can we prove the penrose inequality for @xmath11 using elementary techniques in this setting ?",
    "and if so , do can get a stronger statement than the standard penrose inequality ?",
    "we answer both questions in the affirmative , and we will begin by proving a stronger version of the riemannian positive mass theorem for manifolds that are graphs over @xmath0 by expressing @xmath32 as a divergence and applying the divergence theorem , giving the adm mass as an integral over the manifold of the product of @xmath32 and a nonnegative potential function . in the presence of a boundary",
    "whose connected components are convex , we prove a stronger penrose inequality by giving lower bounds to the boundary integrals using the aleksandrov - fenchel inequality .",
    "before we state our theorems , we begin with some definitions .",
    "@xcite a complete riemannian manifold @xmath34 of dimension @xmath35 is said to be * asymptotically flat * if there is a compact subset @xmath36 such that @xmath37 is diffeomorphic to @xmath38 , and a diffeomorphism @xmath39 such that , in the coordinate chart defined by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 for some @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "note that all this means is that outside a compact set , @xmath1 is diffeomorphic to @xmath0 minus a closed ball and the metric @xmath45 decays sufficiently fast to the flat metric at infinity .",
    "the constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 are chosen so that the adm mass ( see below ) is finite .    for such an asymptotically flat manifold @xmath34 , we can define its total mass ( called the adm mass ) :    @xcite the * adm mass * @xmath4 of a complete , asymptotically flat manifold @xmath34 is defined to be @xmath48 where @xmath7 is the volume of the @xmath49 unit sphere , @xmath50 is the coordinate sphere of radius @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the outward unit normal to @xmath50 and @xmath53 is the area element of @xmath50 in the coordinate chart .",
    "this definition in dimension three was originally due to arnowitt , deser and misner @xcite .",
    "bartnik @xcite showed that the adm mass is independent of the choice of asymptotically flat coordinates .",
    "given a smooth function @xmath54 , the graph of @xmath28 is a complete riemannian manifold . since the graph of @xmath28 with the induced metric from @xmath55 is isometric to @xmath56 , we will from now on refer to @xmath34 as the graph of @xmath28 . for such a graph , we can rephrase the notion of asymptotic flatness in terms of the function @xmath28 :    let @xmath54 be a smooth function and let @xmath57 denote the @xmath58th partial derivative of @xmath28 .",

    "if @xmath68 is contained in a level set of @xmath28 , then the mean curvature @xmath69 of @xmath68 in @xmath34 and the mean curvature @xmath70 with respect to the flat metric @xmath15 are related by @xmath71 thus if @xmath72 as @xmath73 , then @xmath68 is a horizon in @xmath34 .",

    "let @xmath84 be the graph of a smooth asymptotically flat function @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath85 , the inverse of @xmath86 is @xmath87 where the norm of @xmath61 is taken with respect to the flat metric @xmath15 on @xmath0 .",
    "we first compute the christoffel symbols @xmath88 of @xmath34 : @xmath89    since the indices are raised and lowered using the flat metric on @xmath0 , it will be notationally more convenient from now on to write everything as lower indices , with the implicit assumption that any repeated indices are being summed over as usual .    with the above remark in mind ,",
    "we have @xmath90    we can now compute the scalar curvature @xmath32 of @xmath34 using the coordinate expression for scalar curvature : @xmath91    by symmetry , the last term in the last expression is 0 .",
    "after relabeling the indices , the expression for the scalar curvature is @xmath92    let us denote by @xmath93 the divergence operator on @xmath94 . the key observation we need to prove theorem [ pmt ] is the following lemma :    [ lemma1 ] the scalar curvature @xmath32 of the graph @xmath95 satisfies @xmath96    this is a direct calculation : @xmath97 by .",

    "setting , proving theorem [ pi ] is a matter of keeping track of the extra boundary term when we apply the divergence theorem in the proof of theorem [ pmt ] .",
    "as before , any repeated indices are being summed over .    as in the proof of theorem [ pmt ] , we can write the mass of @xmath34 as @xmath101 the difference here is that when we apply the divergence theorem , we get an extra boundary integral : @xmath111 the outward normal to @xmath3 is @xmath112 .",
