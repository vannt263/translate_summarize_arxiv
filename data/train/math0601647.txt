    "it is not hard to show that this is well - defined modulo @xmath18 relations .",
    "however , an easy way to get a well - definition is to take the horizontal slice to be close to the directed line segment .    observe that @xmath106 is defined so that it becomes the identity once one introduces @xmath70 relations , as it represents the difference between having @xmath104 attached in its original position and having @xmath104 slid all the way to the left ( which is zero modulo @xmath16 . )    .",

    "( see the proof of lemma 3.1 in @xcite . )",
    "thus the non-@xmath16 terms cancel out .",

    "thus we need only consider dragging a leg across one of the active sites , say @xmath111 .",
    "the top of figure  [ t1t6 ] depicts the summands of @xmath106 where a leg , @xmath107 , of @xmath104 interacts with the legs in the @xmath111 region .",
    "using @xmath17 relations on the last two terms , we get a difference of two ihx relators , which is therefore trivial , as shown in the bottom of figure  [ t1t6 ] .",
    "* the @xmath68 relation does involve the first component .",
    "here there are three subcases .",
    "* subcase 1 .",
    "* the @xmath68 relation comes from a template graph with a loop being split apart in two ways .",
    "thus all of the feet involved in the @xmath17 relation come from the component @xmath104 .",
    "thus one can picture the rest of the graph being slid to the right of @xmath104 as opposed to @xmath104 being slid to the left , and then apply the argument from case 1 .",
    "* subcase 2 . *",
    "the relation comes from splitting apart two distinct vertices of a template tree , @xmath113 . in this case , the component @xmath104 changes . applying @xmath70 to _ both _ vertices we get a union of three trees , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the @xmath17 relation comes in two pairs of terms , where in each pair two of the trees , @xmath117 , are spliced together and a foot of this resulting tree differs by a transposition with the foot of the third tree in the two terms of the pair .",
    "then claim  [ clm ] indicates that @xmath106 has the effect of converting each pair of terms to the original template tree @xmath113 , with opposite signs , so that the total is zero .",
    "* subcase 3 . *",
    "the relation comes from splitting apart two distinct vertices , each on separate trees , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "assume that @xmath114 has a foot attaching farthest to the left .",
    "using claim  [ clm ] , @xmath106 applied to two of the terms in which @xmath114 is split apart just gives the template @xmath113 . in the other two terms , we are sliding @xmath114 to the left , creating new trivalent vertices along the way , to calculate @xmath106 .",
    "suppose first that the site where @xmath115 is being split is to the right of all of the legs of @xmath114 . then a similar argument to claim  [ clm ] allows us to destroy the created trivalent vertices in exchange for reassembling @xmath115 .",
    "the sum of terms as a result is the difference between attaching @xmath114 all the way to the left ( which is zero modulo @xmath16 ) and attaching @xmath114 in the original position ( which is the template @xmath113 ) .",
    "now we consider the case when the splitting site for @xmath115 is to the left of some legs of @xmath114 . for the above argument to work , we need to show that the sum of terms where a leg of @xmath114 attaches to the two legs in @xmath115 s splitting site is equivalent modulo @xmath17 to the difference of two terms where @xmath115 is reassembled , and the leg of @xmath114 attaches just before and just after @xmath115 s splitting site , as pictured in figure  [ t4 ] .        to see that the equality in figure  [ t4 ] holds , use @xmath17 relations to combine the diagrams in pairs , creating new trivalent vertices , in exchange for splitting apart some other trivalent vertex , such as the one on @xmath114 that we know exists .",
    "equality of the two sides is now an expression of the @xmath18 relation .",
    "hence @xmath106 is injective .",
    "this is fairly obvious .",
    "@xmath106 is calculated by dragging feet of @xmath104 to the left picking up trivalent vertices as the feet attach to the intervening legs . to calculate @xmath98 pull apart these very trivalent vertices .",
    "the result is the difference between the original diagram and the one gotten by sliding @xmath104 all the way to the left , and this latter term lies in @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath119 be given by pulling apart two vertices adjacent to the line segment via @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath120 be defined by @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the map @xmath106 defined on the diagrammatic level .",
    "the fact that @xmath123 is well - defined is straightforward .",
    "@xmath92 is well - defined .",
    "we need to verify that 4 t and sep are in the kernel of @xmath124 .",
    "indeed sep is already in the kernel of @xmath125 . to show that 4 t is in the kernel , suppose first that the first chord @xmath104 is not involved in the relation .",
    "then all terms except the ones where @xmath104 attaches to chords in the relation are clearly in the @xmath126 subspace .",
    "thus we need to show that the sum of terms where @xmath104 attach to the 4 t chords are in the kernel of @xmath125 . using claim  [ clm ] , this is evident .",
    "ad hoc _ calculation takes care of the case when @xmath104 is part of the @xmath58 relation ; this calculation is included in the appendix .",
    "@xmath92 is injective .",
    "this is a consequence of @xmath91 , which follows from the following commutative diagrams : @xmath127 where the vertical arrows are induced by dividing by @xmath70 relations .",
    "the left - hand isomorphism in each diagram is proven to be so in @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath128 and @xmath124 were defined so that they become the identity once one divides by @xmath70 relations , explaining the commutativity of these diagrams .",
    "the maps @xmath106 and @xmath92 are surjective .",
    "if the first component has a trivalent vertex then claim  [ clm ] indicates that it is in the image of @xmath106 . on the other hand ,",
    "these types of diagrams actually generate @xmath67 for @xmath129 , which can be seen as follows . given a diagram not of this form , it is easy to verify that it is equal to a sum of diagrams , where the right hand foot of the first chord is attached to each of the legs between it and the left - hand foot , and where in each of these terms a trivalent vertex has been split into a sum of two terms .",
    "the fact that @xmath92 is onto follows since both @xmath106 and @xmath130 are onto .",
    "( recall that @xmath130 has a larger domain than @xmath106 , but that the range is the same . )",

    "if they meet in a single index , then each of the three terms represents attaching a tree with two trivalent vertices to the three leaves of @xmath155 labeled with the common index @xmath135 , and labeling the left - over leaf @xmath135 .",
