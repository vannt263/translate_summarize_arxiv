    "as in the case of maxfaces ( see @xcite ) , the first author @xcite investigated the global behavior of faces in @xmath0 , in particular proving an osserman - type inequality for complete faces of finite type whose ends are all elliptic , where a complete end of a face is called _ elliptic , parabolic _ , or _ hyperbolic _ if the monodromy matrix of the holomorphic lift @xmath1 is elliptic , parabolic , or hyperbolic , respectively ( see section  [ sec : prelim ] ) .",
    "one of our main results is the following , which implies that the ellipticity or parabolicity of ends follows from completeness :    [ thm : main ] a complete end of a face in @xmath15 is never hyperbolic , so must be either elliptic or parabolic .",

    "<S> the first author studied spacelike constant mean curvature one ( ) surfaces in de sitter 3-space @xmath0 when the surfaces have no singularities except within some compact subset and are of finite total curvature on the complement of this compact subset . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are many surfaces whose singular sets are not compact . in fact , such examples have already appeared in the construction of trinoids given by lee and the last author via hypergeometric functions .    in this paper , we improve the osserman - type inequality given by the first author . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we shall develop a fundamental framework that allows the singular set to be non - compact , and then will use it to investigate the global behavior of surfaces . </S>"
