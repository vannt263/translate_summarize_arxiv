    "interstitials are the most complicated of the simple point defects , and the most elusive . for example , even though arsenic interstitials must be created by irradiation of gaas with sufficiently energetic particles , and they can subsequently be observed to recombine with arsenic vacancies when the sample is heated above @xmath1  c , isolated arsenic interstitials have not been observed directly in epr , electrical , or optical experiments.@xcite    it has been argued based on a thorough analysis @xcite of a variety of experimental data including titration experiments @xcite and measurements of density and lattice parameter@xcite that melt - grown gaas is always as - rich unless the concentration of ga in the melt is substantially greater than 50% , and that this deviation from stoichiometry is due primarily to the creation of large numbers of as interstitials ( @xmath2 ) during growth . in particular , hurle has argued@xcite that the measured deviation of the mass per unit cell as a function of arsenic concentration in the melt must be explained by arsenic interstitials and/or arsenic vacancies , since the number of arsenic antisites which would be required to fit the data is unrealistically large ( up to several percent ) , due to the small difference between the atomic masses of arsenic and gallium .",
    "hurle s work also contains an extensive thermodynamic analysis , including estimates of the mass action constants for the formation of all the neutral native point defects .",
    "these estimates are derived by fitting to a large quantity of experimental data on both doped and undoped gaas , under the assumption that native defect and dopant concentrations are near equilibrium close to the melting point and during high temperature growth from the melt or from solution .    in the high temperature growth regime ,",
    "observations of defects tentatively described as high concentrations or diffuse ` clouds ' of arsenic interstitials have been reported in gaas grown by the horizontal bridgman and liquid - encapsulated czochralski methods , based on x - ray diffuse scattering@xcite and quasi - forbidden x - ray reflection intensity measurements.@xcite however , the atomic composition and microscopic structure of these defects can not be unambiguously determined from these experiments .",
    "gallium arsenide grown by arsenic - rich molecular beam epitaxy at low temperature ( lt gaas ) is a semi - insulating material with a host of potentially useful applications.@xcite this material contains up to 1.5% excess as,@xcite which is accommodated by high concentrations of point defects in un - annealed samples , and arsenic precipitates plus somewhat lower concentrations of point defects in annealed samples .",
    "concentrations of as antisites ( @xmath3 ) up to @xmath4  @xmath5 are observed in lt gaas , as measured by electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr),@xcite near - infrared absorption ( nira ) and magnetic circular dichroism of absorption ( mcda),@xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm).@xcite concentrations of ga vacancies ( @xmath6 ) up to @xmath7  @xmath5 are measured in lt gaas by slow positron annihilation.@xcite ion channeling experiments have been interpreted as providing evidence for large concentrations of as interstitials in lt gaas.@xcite however , it was later pointed out that the observed high concentration of atoms in the channel near the normal arsenic lattice sites could also be due to outward relaxation of the nearest neighbors of the as antisites.@xcite    within certain well defined limits of the growth parameters for lt gaas , a linear correlation between the neutral @xmath3 concentration and the lattice dilation has been found.@xcite it was therefore proposed that @xmath3 are the dominant defects which determine the lattice expansion for growth within this regime .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite used a self - consistent density - functional - based tight - binding method to study the lattice distortion induced by point defects in as - rich gaas , and concluded that only @xmath3 are necessary to understand the observed lattice expansion in the regime where the linear correlation is observed , and that if concentrations of isolated as@xmath8 comparable to the measured concentrations of @xmath3 were also present , the lattice expansion would be three times greater than is experimentally observed .",
    "however , luysberg _ et al . _  have reported that when the as / ga flux ratio is increased beyond a beam equivalent pressure ( bep ) ratio of 20 , there is a departure from the linear correlation between lattice dilation and antisite concentration.@xcite it was pointed out that other defects must be present to account for the deviation from stoichiometry and the lattice expansion at high as / ga flux ratios.@xcite    nonequilibrium processes such as diffusion and compositional intermixing at interfaces can also be strongly affected by point defects that are present in high concentrations . since the point defects which have been unambiguously documented as present in high concentrations in lt gaas , @xmath3 and @xmath9 , occupy sites on the gallium sublattice , they can not contribute directly to interdiffusion on the arsenic sublattice .",
    "however , substantial concentrations of arsenic interstitials may affect interdiffusion on the arsenic sublattice .",
    "for example , an experimental study showing a positive dependence of gaasp / gaas and gaassb / gaas interdiffusion on arsenic pressure has indicated that a kickout mechanism involving arsenic interstitials is the dominant process for the as - p and as - sb interdiffusion in the material studied.@xcite    similarly , annealing lt - gaas @xmath10-doped with sb was found to produce substantially greater compositional intermixing than annealing conventional stoichiometric gaas similarly @xmath10-doped.@xcite this enhancement of as - sb interdiffusion was attributed to an oversaturation of arsenic interstitials in the lt gaas samples , resulting from the balance of arsenic interstitials with arsenic clusters and all the other excess - arsenic - containing defects in the material .",
    "the effective activation energy for as - sb interdiffusion in lt gaas deduced from this work , 0.6 @xmath11 0.15 ev,@xcite is reasonably close to the migration energy of 0.5 ev for arsenic interstitials deduced from annealing experiments on defects produced by electron irradiation,@xcite as well as to migration energies subsequently ascribed to arsenic interstitial defects produced in gaas by other means .",
    "the concentration of arsenic interstitials required to produce sufficient oversaturation to eliminate completely any contribution of the interstitial formation energy to the activation energy for as - sb intermixing measured in the lt gaas sample was estimated to be roughly @xmath7  @xmath5 , using hurle s thermodynamic analysis in conjunction with the experimental data.@xcite    theoretical attempts to obtain a picture of the microscopic structure and properties of the lowest energy arsenic interstitial configuration(s ) began with the work of baraff and schlter , who used density functional green s function calculations to investigate the energies of reactions creating native defects with @xmath12 symmetry in gaas , including arsenic interstitials in the two tetrahedral sites.@xcite the effects of lattice relaxation were ignored . baraff and schlter concluded that simple tetrahedral arsenic interstitials were less likely to occur than vacancy and antisite defects under all equilibrium conditions , although they could not rule out the possibility that other , more complicated interstitial configurations might have a lower energy.@xcite    jansen and sankey calculated the formation energies for unrelaxed native defects with tetrahedral symmetry in gaas , including arsenic interstitials in tetrahedral sites , using a density - functional pseudopotential method with a basis set of pseudo - atomic orbitals and a single special * k*-point in supercells containing about 32 atoms.@xcite in order to calculate the formation energies for individual defects instead of reaction energies for defect reactions which conserve the number of atoms of each species , they were required to choose a value for the arsenic chemical potential ( or equivalently , for the gallium chemical potential ) .",
    "an arbitrary value was chosen , corresponding to the condition that the formation energies for neutral gallium vacancies and for neutral arsenic vacancies should be equal .",
    "jansen and sankey concluded that arsenic interstitials in tetrahedral sites should be less numerous than vacancies and antisites in gaas under equilibrium conditions,@xcite in agreement with baraff and schlter .",
    "zhang and northrup used density functional theory ( dft ) within the local density approximation ( lda ) and supercells of about 32 atoms to calculate the formation energies for vacancies , antisites , and tetrahedral interstitials in gaas as a function of arsenic chemical potential , over the physically allowable range of chemical potentials , from ga - rich to as - rich.@xcite this physically allowable range is set by the heat of formation of bulk gaas and by the requirement that the arsenic chemical potential may not exceed the chemical potential of bulk arsenic , since the material is in equilibrium with arsenic precipitates in the arsenic - rich limit .",
    "the atomic coordinates were allowed to relax in these calculations , within the constraints imposed by the tetrahedral symmetry . in agreement with the previous work",
    ", zhang and northrup found that antisites and/or vacancies should be more numerous than arsenic interstitials in tetrahedral sites under all equilibrium conditions.@xcite    chadi used dft - lda calculations and 33-atom supercells to investigate many different types of bonding configurations for self - interstitials in gaas , including various split interstitials , as well as hexagonal , two - fold coordinated , and tetrahedral interstitials , all fully relaxed within the constraints of the chosen symmetry.@xcite he found that the lowest energy configuration for arsenic interstitials in the neutral or @xmath13 charge state is a split interstitial consisting of two as atoms sharing an arsenic lattice site , displaced from this site in opposite directions along a @xmath14110@xmath15-like axis , while the lowest energy configuration for positively charged arsenic interstitials in the + 1 or + 2 charge state is a split interstitial consisting of an as atom and a ga atom sharing an gallium lattice site , displaced from this site in opposite directions along a @xmath14100@xmath15-like axis .",
    "since we will be interested below primarily in arsenic interstitials in semi - insulating or @xmath0-type gaas , we will use the notation as@xmath8-as for the interstitial with two atoms sharing an arsenic site and aligned along a @xmath14110@xmath15-like axis , which should be the lowest energy interstitial configuration in semi - insulating or @xmath0-type material .",
    "chadi also showed that neutral arsenic interstitials , which have unpaired spins , are unstable relative to formation of a pair of + 1 and @xmath13 charged interstitials  _ i.e. _   arsenic interstitials form a negative-@xmath16 system .",
    "this suggested that arsenic interstitials may not be observable in epr experiments.@xcite chadi reported the relative energies for the most energetically favorable arsenic interstitial configurations in each of these charge states , including in each case a number of metastable configurations somewhat higher in energy than the lowest energy configurations , all of which were more complicated than the simple tetrahedral configurations.@xcite however , since chadi did not report absolute interstitial formation energies as a function of arsenic chemical potential , no comparison with the formation energies of defects involving a different number of excess arsenic atoms , such as arsenic antisites , was possible from this work .",
    "landman _ et al .",

    "concluded that the lowest energy split as@xmath8 may have a concentration approaching that of as@xmath17 for certain fermi levels.@xcite    since the theoretical investigations described above have been carried out over a long period of time , it has gradually become possible not only to include lattice relaxation and to investigate more complicated interstitial configurations , but also to do more accurate calculations , using larger unit cells and better sets of * k*-points for the summations over * k*-space .",

    "furthermore , puska _ et al .",
    "_  concluded that cell sizes of 128 to 216 atoms are needed to properly assess the physical properties of the silicon vacancy in bulk silicon , because of the dispersion of energy levels and long range ionic relationships.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate the combined effects of cell size and * k*-space sampling on the formation energy , charge state transitions , atomic relaxations , and characterization of localized defect states for arsenic self - interstitials in gaas . because of",
    "the more ionic nature of the material and the complicated split interstitial defect structure , comparison of these results for interstitials in gaas to the previous results for vacancies in silicon@xcite can enhance our understanding of the range of behavior for different defects in different materials .",
    "we compare the formation energy of the lowest energy arsenic interstitial in @xmath0-type or semi - insulating gaas , as@xmath8-as , with the formation energies of as@xmath17 and @xmath6 at the arsenic - rich end of the range of physically allowed chemical potentials , all calculated by state - of - the - art dft pseudopotential@xcite calculations , using the larger supercells and sets of special * k*-points which we have determined to be necessary .",
    "we conclude our study by discussing the relative concentrations of these defects in equilibrium in as - rich , @xmath0-type or semi - insulating gaas at growth temperatures , and reporting the computed charge transition levels and expected electrical behavior of as@xmath8-as as a function of fermi level .",
    "we have used the molecular dynamics code developed at the fritz haber institut ( fhimd)@xcite for this investigation , using density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite within the local density approximation ( lda ) , with the ceperley - alder @xcite form for the exchange and correlation potentials as parameterized by perdew and zunger.@xcite the core electrons are treated in the frozen - core approximation and the ion cores are replaced by fully - separable @xcite norm - conserving pseudopotentials.@xcite plane waves are included up to the energy cutoff of 10  ry .",
    "the atoms are allowed to relax until the force components are are less than @xmath20  hartrees per bohr radius and the zero temperature formation energies change by less than @xmath21  hartrees per step for at least 100 steps .",
    "to evaluate the defect formation energy , we used the formalism of zhang and northrup,@xcite which gives for the formation energy in the as - rich limit at zero temperature @xmath22 here @xmath23 electrons have been transferred to a reservoir at the fermi energy @xmath24 in order to produce a defect in the desired charge state .",
    "@xmath25 is the zero - temperature total energy produced by the _ ab initio _",
    "code for a supercell containing the desired defect , the chemical potential @xmath26 is the energy per atomic pair of bulk gaas , and the arsenic chemical potential in the as - rich limit , @xmath27 , is the energy per atom of pure bulk as computed using the same _ ab initio _ code and pseudopotentials . @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the numbers of atoms of each species in the supercell containing the defect . we will discuss the effect of temperature , which can be important for defect concentrations , in section [ sec : resultsanddiscussion ] .",
    "because the zero of the energy levels floats freely , @xcite results from different dft supercell calculations must be aligned in order to obtain the correct charge transition levels .",
    "we apply the procedure outlined by kohan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in which we first compute the difference between the electrical potential in the supercell with the neutral defect and the electrical potential for the corresponding bulk crystal supercell , averaged over parallel planes , as a function of position along a line normal to the planes .",
    "far from the defect within the supercell , this difference becomes a constant . in order to make the potential",
    "far from the neutral defect equal to the corresponding potential in the bulk cell , a uniform shift is applied to the potential and the energy levels , yielding the proper alignment of the energy levels of the defect with the energy levels of ideal bulk crystal supercell .",
    "the same shift is applied for all charge states of a given defect .",
    "a well - known shortcoming of the lda is that it underestimates the band gaps of materials .",
    "the typical method for dealing with this problem is to simply shift the conduction band states up uniformly by the amount needed to reproduce the experimental gap , using the so - called ` scissors operator'.@xcite more recently , an analytically - based model justifying the rigid shifting upward of all conduction band states by a scissors - type correction has been shown to produce good results for a large number of semiconductors.@xcite since the lda can produce similarly large errors in the energies of the deep defect states , it is also important to correct for these errors when determining where the charge transition levels corresponding to deep defect states lie in the experimental gap . unfortunately , a full gw calculation , @xcite which would correct these errors , is not currently possible for the large supercells needed for studies of defects .",
    "therefore , we apply the same upward shift to the defect states with predominantly conduction band character as is applied to the conduction band states themselves , while leaving the defect states with predominantly valence band character fixed relative to the valence band edge .",
    "we used cubic supercells with dimensions of both two and three times the computationally determined bulk lattice constant , corresponding to bulk cells of 64 and 216 atoms , along with three different brillouin zone ( bz ) sampling schemes to examine the effects cell size and sampling scheme have on the formation energies and transition levels for the as@xmath8-as . in order to investigate the most efficient choice of * k*-points to obtain good results ,",

    "[ fig : formationenergymethods ] is the wider variation in the energies computed using the smaller supercell .",

    "the @xmath30 mp mesh produces results between those of the other two * k*-space summation methods .",
    "the effect of these small variations in bond lengths is to reduce the changes in bond length seen in the @xmath31 mp mesh calculations when the defect becomes charged , if one of the other * k*-space sampling methods is used instead . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath33 sampling is observed to produce a somewhat smaller dependence of these bond lengths on charge state .",
    "this dependence of bond lengths on the charge state of the defect is seen below to result from the changes in occupation of the deep defect state when the charge state is changed , and from the bonding or antibonding character of this state for particular bonds .",
    "focusing on results for the 217 atom cell with the @xmath31 mp mesh , we observe that the distance between the atoms of the defect has a significant dependence on the charge state of the system .",
    "the as - as bond expands to 2.47     ( about 3.5% compared to the neutral state bond length ) , when the system is allowed to relax in the @xmath13 charge state .",
    "this can be easily understood , since the antibonding defect state on the two as atoms is doubly occupied and can cause a stronger repulsive contribution to the interaction between these two atoms for the @xmath511 charge state of the defect , while it is only singly occupied for the neutral state of the defect .    when the system is allowed to relax in the @xmath38 state the as - as bond shrinks to 2.31   , a contraction of about 3% .",
    "this can also be easily understood , since the antibonding defect state on the two as atoms of the defect is completely unoccupied for the + 1 charge state , so it no longer makes a repulsive contribution to the interaction between the two as atoms . the bond length between ga(1 ) or ga(3 ) and",
    "either as atom of the defect is 3.5% longer and the bond length between ga(2 ) or ga(4 ) and the nearest defect as atom is 1.9% longer in the @xmath38 state than in the neutral state .",
    "since the deep defect state acts as a bonding state for the as - ga bonds between the defect as atoms and ga(1 ) and ga(3 ) , as discussed above in section  [ subsec : formationechargetransitlevelsanddefectstates ] , it is easy to understand why these bonds are longer in the @xmath38 state , when the defect state is fully unoccupied and can no longer contribute to the strength of these bonds .",
    "we note that because of the contribution of the defect state to the as - ga bonds between the defect as atoms and ga(1 ) and ga(3 ) , these two ga atoms move significantly when the charge state is changed , changing the occupation of the defect state .",
    "these ga atoms are about 4% closer to each other in the @xmath13 state and about 5.5% farther apart in the @xmath38 state than in the neutral state .",
    "the other two ga atoms , each bonded to only one defect as atom , do not move in response to the change in charge state .    in performing these calculations , we fixed the lattice constant at the value determined through minimization of the energy of the bulk crystal . while the ideal calculation should include a full lattice constant determination with each change of defect configuration , for simplicity we did not perform this relaxation .",
    "this may be deemed a reasonable choice in light of evidence presented by puska , _",
    "et al._@xcite   for _ ab initio _ supercell calculations in the lda , using supercells of sizes comparable to ours , in which vacancies in bulk si are found to alter the lattice constant by around 0.2% , while artificially introduced distortions in the lattice constant of up to 1% are seen not to affect their reported results significantly .",
    "we now compare our well - converged results for the formation energies of the elementary excess - arsenic - containing point defects , as@xmath17 , @xmath6 , and as@xmath8-as ( the most favorable as@xmath8 configuration in semi - insulating or @xmath0-type gaas ) , computed using the large supercell and the @xmath31 mp mesh .",
    "these formation energies in the as - rich limit , corresponding to gaas in equilibrium with bulk arsenic , are presented as a function of fermi energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : formationenergies ] .",
    "the formation energies for two specific choices of fermi energy have also been listed in table  [ table : formationenergies ] in section  [ subsec : formationechargetransitlevelsanddefectstates ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : formationenergies ] , we can see that the @xmath6 and as@xmath17 defects possess significantly lower formation energies than the as@xmath8-as for all fermi energies .",
    "for example , the formation energy for as@xmath17 is seen to be at least 2 ev lower than the formation energy for as@xmath8-as for all fermi energies .",
    "small uncertainties in the formation energy should not alter this strong qualitative ordering of the formation energies or the prediction based on this ordering that equilibrium concentrations of as@xmath8-as should be significantly lower than equilibrium concentrations of as@xmath17 , as discussed below .        to estimate equilibrium concentrations of the excess - arsenic - containing defects we begin with the usual expression @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of sites at which the defect can form in the crystal per unit volume",
    ", @xmath54 is the total energy of formation of the defect , @xmath55 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath46 is the temperature .",
    "the formation entropy of the defect is @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the pressure , and @xmath58 is the change in the crystal volume associated with the defect formation .",
    "we note that the defect formation energy @xmath54 for charged defects , as given by the formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : formation ] ) , has an explicit dependence on the fermi energy , in addition to its dependence on the calculated energies for defect formation at zero fermi energy .",
    "therefore we must compute the fermi energy self - consistently , in order to determine the native defect concentrations present in a particular sample .",
    "if any electrically active impurities or dopants are present in the material , the concentrations of these impurities or dopants in all charge states must also be taken into account .",
    "we must set up the charge balance equation , requiring that the free electron and hole concentrations ( which also depend on the fermi level ) must cancel out any net charge resulting from the concentrations of all positively and negatively charged defects and impurities .",
    "this equation can then be solved to determine the fermi level .",
    "once the fermi level is known , it may be used to determine the formation energies and the resulting equilibrium concentrations of all the defects present .",
    "if the defect formation energy @xmath59 for the most energetically favorable charge state of as@xmath8-as in a particular sample is within @xmath60 of the formation energy of the most favorable charge state of as@xmath17 , we may expect that the equilibrium concentrations of these two defects are comparable , assuming that the effects of the entropy of formation @xmath56 and the change in the crystal volume @xmath58 associated with the defect formation can be neglected .",
    "we will now concentrate on the relative defect concentrations at 1500 k ( near the melting point of gaas ) , since defects with a higher formation energy such as as@xmath8-as have their greatest chance to attain equilibrium concentrations comparable to those of more energetically favorable defects at high temperature .",
    "we will estimate the effective corrections to the formation energy which occur at this temperature due to the entropy of formation and change in volume associated with the defects .",
    "first , to estimate the effect of the change in volume , we let @xmath57 be atmospheric pressure and overestimate @xmath58 to be the volume per bulk atom in the cell , which gives an effective correction to the defect formation energy @xmath61 of @xmath62  ev . we may safely neglect this correction .",
    "previous calculations@xcite on defects in si found that the formation entropy @xmath56 is dominated by vibrational contributions , and that the formation entropies are @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the self - interstitial and the vacancy , respectively .",
    "we note that the self - interstitial in silicon is a @xmath14110@xmath15 split interstitial with the same basic structure as as@xmath8-as in gaas .",
    "therefore , in analogy to the results for defects in silicon,@xcite we may assume that it is unlikely for the split interstitial as@xmath8-as to have a very different formation entropy when compared to defects such as as@xmath17 , which only contain atoms occupying lattice sites .",
    "if we let @xmath65 ( an overestimate ) for as@xmath8-as , this gives rise to an effective reduction of the defect formation energy by @xmath66 , or 1.3  ev at 1500  k. even if we apply no reduction to the as@xmath17 formation energy due to entropy , this still leaves the effective formation energy about 0.7  ev higher for as@xmath8-as than for as@xmath17 , producing equilibrium concentrations of as@xmath8-as which are about 0.4% those of as@xmath17 at 1500  k.    we conclude that even using this extremely liberal estimate for the formation entropy of as@xmath8-as and ignoring the formation entropy of as@xmath17 can not lead to an as@xmath8-as concentration approaching that of the antisites in thermal equilibrium .",
    "although the placement of the calculated charge transition levels in the experimental gap has an uncertainty far exceeding 0.1  ev due to the shortcomings of the lda in calculating the gap , as discussed in section  [ sec : computationalmethod ] , our as - calculated band gap and charge transition levels are reported here to 0.1  ev ( or 0.01  ev , for the closely spaced @xmath6 levels ) , for the convenience of the reader who prefers not to read them off the picture in fig .",
    "[ fig : formationenergies ] . for the as@xmath17",
    ", the ( + 2/+1 ) transition level appears at 0.4  ev above the vbm , and the ( + 1/0 ) level is at @xmath67 .",
    "for the as@xmath8-as , the ( + 1/0 ) transition is at @xmath68 , and the ( 0/@xmath13 ) transition is at @xmath69 .",
    "the levels for the @xmath6 defect are at 0.09  ev , 0.13  ev , and 0.2  ev above the vbm for the ( 0/@xmath13 ) , ( @xmath13/@xmath70 ) , and ( @xmath70/@xmath71 ) transitions , respectively .",
    "the calculated band gap of 0.8 ev is underestimated by 0.7  ev compared to the experimental zero - temperature gap of 1.5  ev .    as discussed previously in section  [ sec : computationalmethod ] , we can get a rough estimate of where the charge transition levels fall within the experimental gap by shifting the conduction band derived states ( including the deep defect states with primarily conduction band character ) by the amount needed to correct the gap , while leaving the defect states with predominantly valence band character fixed relative to the valence band edge .",
    "since the acceptor levels of the @xmath6 are derived from the dangling bonds on the arsenic neighbors of the vacancy , which require three extra electrons to fill them , they should have the predominantly valence band character of anion dangling bond states . in section  [ subsec :",
    "formationechargetransitlevelsanddefectstates ] , the deep defect state of the as@xmath8-as was shown to have predominantly arsenic @xmath39-type character , similar to the character of the valence band edge states .",
    "however , the as@xmath17 double donor defect state derives from an antibonding state of predominantly conduction band character , which has been lowered in energy due to the replacement of the original anion - cation bonds of the ideal crystal by anion - anion bonds between the antisite and its nearest neighbors .",
    "this donor state is occupied by the two extra electrons contributed by the arsenic atom that has been substituted for a gallium atom , which can not be accommodated in the bonding states of the valence band .",
    "we conclude that the charge transition levels of the v@xmath17 and the as@xmath8-as should remain fixed relative to the valence band edge , while the donor levels of as@xmath17 , which possess a conduction band character , should be shifted up together with the conduction band states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scissors1 ] , we show the charge transition levels for these defects corrected by the above procedure , using the room temperature gap of 1.4  ev .",
    "the transition levels of as@xmath17 are shifted to 1.0  ev and 1.1  ev , in fortuitously good agreement with the mcda results identified with this defect in lt gaas,@xcite although the transitions are both about 0.4  ev higher than those associated with as@xmath17 in melt - grown gaas.@xcite",
    "in this work we have shown that larger supercells and a better * k*-space sampling than have been used in a large number of previous dft defect calculations are required to give accurate results for the formation energies , charge transition levels , defect state properties , and atomic structure and relaxation for the arsenic split interstitial in gaas . in particular , we find that 217-atom supercells are necessary to get good results for the charge transition levels and the dispersion of the deep defect state , even though the arrangement of atoms in the structure is well converged in a 65-atom cell , particularly if one uses the finely spaced @xmath31 mp * k*-space mesh .",
