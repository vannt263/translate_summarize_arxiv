    "the origin of the objects known as high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ; wakker & van woerden 1997 ) remains a problem within the framework of galaxy evolution .",
    "traditionally studied through 21-cm emission , hvcs do not have a detectable stellar component , and they are characterized by line centroids , typically at negative local standard of rest velocities , @xmath8 , that deviate from models of galactic rotation .",
    "the subsolar metallicities of hvcs imply that some fraction of the gas consists of primordial material .",
    "the continuous infall of low - metallicity ( @xmath9 ) gas onto the disk is predicted by galaxy formation models that seek to explain such phenomena as the g - dwarf problem ( pagel 1994 ) .",
    "although their distances are uncertain , hvcs may trace structure formation on galactic or local group scales .",
    "one of the best studied hvcs in recent years has been complex  c , infalling gas located at least 6 kpc distant ( wakker 2001 ) .",
    "consideration of its large angular size ( @xmath10 deg@xmath11 ) effectively limits it to a nearby location in the galactic halo .",
    "complex c is pierced by more uv - bright quasar sight lines than any other high - velocity cloud , making it an ideal laboratory to investigate the nature of high - velocity gas .",
    "ion abundances have been investigated in several studies ( wakker et  al .  1999 ,",
    "gibson et  al .",
    "2001 , richter et  al .",
    "2001 , collins et  al .  2003 [ hereafter csg03 ] , tripp et  al .",
    "2003 ) , all of which indicate that the complex has a subsolar metallicity .",
    "the most robust of these studies utilize the [ / ] abundance to determine metallicity .",
    "since is coupled to through charge exchange , we can assume that [ / ] @xmath12 ( o / h ) .",
    "other ion abundances such as [ / ] require substantial and uncertain ionization corrections to determine the elemental abundance . by investigating all complex c",
    "_ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) and _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) sight lines available at the time , csg03 derived a metallicity range , @xmath13 , based on the three sight lines for which [ / ] could be measured .",
    "this range of metallicities suggests that complex  c is a mixture of infalling primordial material ( with @xmath14 ) and higher - metallicity material that is produced in the galactic disk and then elevated in a  galactic fountain \" ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ) .",
    "alternatively , such metal - poor gas might be expelled from local group dwarf galaxies into the galactic halo .",
    "we hope to gain insight into how these two reservoirs entrain and mix by observing elemental abundances and ionization distributions in multiple sight lines through complex  c. further evidence for an enrichment of complex c by galactic material comes from analysis of elemental abundances , whose pattern can yield information about the nucleosynthetic history of the constituent metals ( pettini 2004 ) .",
    "alpha - process elements ( such as o , si , and s ) are produced predominantly by type ii supernovae ( sne ) , while fe is produced primarily by type ia sne .",
    "nitrogen is produced mostly by lower mass stars in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stage . with the bulk of @xmath15-element production occurring relatively soon after star - formation",
    "is initiated , the release of n and fe into the ism can lag s or o enrichment by @xmath16 myr ( henry et  al .  2000 ) .",
    "many of the previous complex c studies find that n is depleted significantly relative to the @xmath15-elements , sometimes by as much as a factor of 10 .",
    "several studies also found evidence for a slight decrement in fe that can not be attributed to dust depletion .",
    "csg03 suggest that this abundance pattern is consistent with enrichment by type ii sne , followed by ejection from the star - forming region in a galactic fountain before significant n and fe enrichment .",
    "if the infalling complex c is mixing with fountain material , there should be observable signatures of that mixing .",
    "if mixing occurs more efficiently in the outer regions of the complex , while cloud cores remain relatively pristine , then one may expect to see an anti - correlation between component metallicity and @xmath0 .",
    "based on the three sight lines with accurate [ / ] metallicities , csg03 found evidence for such a dependence , with the highest column density sight line at the lowest metallicity .",
    "however , the statistics of the correlation are poor , and measurements of additional sight lines are needed .    since the low ions track elemental abundances ,",
    "complex c is typically discussed in those terms .",
    "however , the cloud has multiphase structure consisting of highly ionized gas , detected in , , and ( fox et  al .",
    "2004 ; hereafter f04 ) . in previous work ( collins , shull , & giroux 2004 , 2005 , hereafter csg04 and csg05 ) .",
    "discussed the presence of multiphase gas , produced in bow shocks produced at the interfaces between infalling hvcs in the galactic halo .",
    "the h@xmath15 emission measures of complex c and other hvcs are consistent with photoionization by escaping radiation from ob associations in the disk ( bland - hawthorn & putman 2001 ) .",
    "csg03 found that the low - ion abundance pattern in complex c is consistent with such an ionization source .",
    "although photoionization can explain the production of neutral and singly - ionized species , it can not simultaneously explain the highly ionized component .",
    "f04 analyzed high ion ratios for the pg  1259 + 593 sight line and found that they are consistent with the production of highly ionized gas at the interface of complex c and a hotter surrounding medium .",
    "since complex c is a known halo object with abundant quasar sight lines , it provides a test case for studying the production of highly ionized gas in the general hvc population ( sembach et  al .",
    "the understanding of the production of highly ionized high - velocity gas is of particular interest for the study of the unusual class of `` highly ionized hvcs '' ( sembach et  al .",
    "1999 ; collins , shull , & giroux 2004 , 2005 , hereafter csg04 and csg05 ) .",
    "we have suggested ( csg04 , csg05 ) that the majority of highly ionized hvcs represent low column density analogs to objects such as complex c , whereas nicastro et  al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) have proposed that they trace shock - heated filaments of the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) at large distances .",
    "better characterization of the highly ionized component of complex c may shed light on the nature of the highly ionized hvcs .    since the publication of csg03 , several new complex  c data sets from _ fuse _   and _ hst",
    "_  appeared .",
    "these new datasets fall into one of three categories : 1 ) new or additional _ fuse _  data that have increased the effective exposure time , in some cases significantly ; 2 ) new _",
    "e140 m , e230 m , or g140 m exposures ; 3 ) mrk 205 , a complex c sight line of low-@xmath0  with high quality _ fuse _   and _ hst_-stis e140 m data neglected in previous complex c studies . among these new datasets",
    "are _ fuse _   spectra for 7 complex c sight lines , including _",
    "hst_-stis data for 5 of these 7 sight lines .",
    "we couple these new data with previously presented complex c data for the 8 sight lines from csg03 and one ( 3c  351 ) from tripp et  al .",

    "however , the contamination is generally centered at @xmath19 km  s@xmath20  and does not affect the higher - velocity complex c absorption .",
    "individual exposures were coadded , weighted by their signal - to - noise , to yield a final spectrum . before coadding datasets taken several years apart , we checked spectra for unusual differences between datasets .",
    "if the differences were judged to be severe , then offending datasets were not included in the final coadded spectrum . in several cases",

    "the most significant difference was a factor of @xmath21 decrease in the flux of mrk 279 in its 2002 data .",

    "other less significant differences warranting rejected data for specific lif or sic segments include the absence of segment data or a strong continuum deviation .    a single resolution element of the _ fuse _  spectrum is about 20 km  s@xmath20  ( @xmath22 pixels ) and , as a result data are oversampled at that resolution .",
    "thus , to further improve signal - to - noise , we rebinned the data over 5 pixels . to set the absolute wavelength scale",

    "in this section , we present measurements of ion column densities from the new data for complex c sight lines . in each of these sight lines , except mrk 501",
    ", we detect metal - line absorption associated with complex c. the mrk 501 data exhibit features that are likely due to a low-@xmath0  complex c component , although the low signal to noise in that data prevents measurements greater that @xmath27 significance for any of the complex c features . as a result",
    ", the mrk 501 sight line provides only weak upper limits on abundances , and we do not discuss the sight line further .    in order to measure column densities of ion species , we begin by extracting individual line profiles from the full _ fuse _  and _ hst_-stis spectra .",
    "these profiles are normalized by fitting low - order polynomials to the continuum @xmath28310    about the line in question , although in a number of cases spurious features near the line required the use of a much larger region for continuum measurement . for each sight line , we determine the velocity range of complex c from the  profile .",
    "we then measure the equivalent width , @xmath29 , of an absorption feature by integrating the line over the velocity range occupied by complex c. this technique works well for low ions ( neutral or singly - ionized ) , but high - ions ( , , ) can extend in velocity by as much as 45 km  s@xmath20   beyond the bounds established by the profile . in those cases ,",
    "we integrate the high ions over the full observed high - velocity absorption .",
    "when lines can not be measured , we estimate 3@xmath30 upper limits to @xmath29 .",
    "the _ fuse _  bandpass contains numerous h@xmath31  lines that often contaminate high - velocity absorption for metal lines . in cases of weak contamination of high - velocity features",
    ", we can often quantify the contribution from contaminating h@xmath31 . in order to model the contribution from a contaminating h@xmath31  line , we analyze other isolated h@xmath31  lines of the same rotation state @xmath32 . by fitting several lines for a given @xmath32 with gaussian profiles , and fitting measured values of @xmath29 with a curve of growth",
    ", we can model the expected profile of the contaminant line .",
    "if the contamination of the complex c feature is weak , we can subtract the contaminating absorption to reveal the complex c profile and measure its equivalent width .",
    "an example of such a fit is shown in figure 1 to the @xmath33 line for mrk 290 . as indicated by the h@xmath31-subtracted profile",
    ", the remaining feature resembles other complex c absorption lines seen in that sight line ( see figure 5 for other mrk 290 profiles ) . in many cases ,",
    "the h@xmath31  contamination is too strong to accurately analyze the underlying complex c profile ( note the h@xmath31  contamination of high - velocity @xmath33 in the component 2 profile for mrk 876 in figure 6 ) .    in order to determine the column densities of ion species , we attempt to fit the data with a curve of growth",
    "this requires the measurement of minimally two lines for one species in any given complex c component .",
    "we are able to empirically fit a curve of growth to low ions in complex c components towards mrk 205 , mrk 279 , mrk 290 , and mrk 876 . in cases where a curve of growth can not be fit , we use the apparent optical depth ( aod ) method to measure column densities of lines that are clearly optically thin ( savage & sembach 1991 ) . in other cases , where unresolved saturation may be an issue , as occurs for the  @xmath34 line in particular , we estimate a range of possible column densities .",
    "since the primary goal of this work is to specifically determine abundances , we estimate the column density range by using the observed spread in doppler @xmath35-values determined from curve - of - growth fits to data including lines in other complex c sight lines . considering all of the complex c sight lines that we have analyzed here and in csg03 , the @xmath35 values fitted to data that include lines range from 10.2 km  s@xmath20  @xmath36 km  s@xmath20 . using this spread of @xmath35-values",
    ", we can establish the range of possible column densities from lines of moderate optical depth .",
    "the high - ions , , , and probably reside in a different component than the low ions , and are thus not well described by a @xmath35-value determined from species of a lower degree of ionization . for the high - ions , we use the apparent optical depth method to measure column densities . all rest wavelengths and oscillator strengths",
    "are from morton ( 2003 ) .",
    "values of @xmath0  are measured from data taken at the effelsberg 100-m telescope , except in the case of hs 1543 + 5921 , for which we measure @xmath0   from data of the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( lds ; hartmann & burton 1997 ) .",

    "( 2003 ) , except in the cases of mrk 279 and mrk 876 , which exhibit blended multi - component complex c structure . in those cases , we directly integrate the effelsberg profile to calculate @xmath0 .",
    "the beam sizes of the effelsberg telescope and lds are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , whereas the beam size in quasar absorption spectroscopy is effectively determined by the sub - arcsecond angular size of the quasar emitting region .",

    "it is important to include measurements from all available complex c sight lines .",
    "there are four additional complex c sight lines , not presented here , which have been thoroughly analyzed in previous studies .",
    "csg03 analyzed the additional complex c sight lines mrk  817 , pg  1259 + 593 , and pg  1351 + 640 .",
    "tripp et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) included equivalent width and apparent - optical - depth column density measurements toward the 3c 351 sight line .",
    "using this dataset , we find that complex c has metallicity ranging from 0.09 to 0.29 @xmath4 , based on the [ / ] abundance .",
    "this range is based strictly on the seven complex c components in six sight lines , where we can empirically fit a curve of growth .",
    "two other sightlines have less reliable values of [ / ] , owing to a range of possible doppler parameters for the curve of growth .",
    "the allowed range of metallicities towards 3c 351 is consistent with the more reliable data , while the range of abundances towards pg  1626 + 554 allows a metallicity as high as 0.39 @xmath4 if @xmath376 km  s@xmath20 .",
    "our reliably measured range , @xmath378 , indicates a factor - of - three variation in metal enrichment across complex c. the mean abundance of those 7 components yields an average complex c metallicity of @xmath379 , with a column - density - weighted mean of @xmath5 . as with the conclusions of previous complex c studies ( csg03 ; tripp et  al .",
    "2003 ) , these metallicities indicate that complex c consists of more than just primordial material , with enriched material as well , most likely of galactic origin ( or expelled from local group dwarfs ) . as for",
    "the range in metallicity , certain regions of complex c appear to be more highly mixed with enriched gas than others .",
    "the @xmath380 errors on these measurements are typically within a factor of 1.5 , and the beam - size systematic error is within a factor of 1.25 . it is unlikely that that these results are consistent with a uniform metallicity for complex c.    in order to trace possible signatures of gas mixing , we looked for trends in [ / ] .",
    "one possible signature of gas mixing could be a dependence of [ / ] on column density .",
    "sight lines passing through low-@xmath0  regions could trace areas where gas mixing is more efficient , whereas high-@xmath0  regions mark cloud cores , where mixing may not be as effective .",
    "such a scenario is consistent with the 3 [ / ] measurements presented in csg03 .",
    "figure 8 shows a plot of [ / ] vs.  log  @xmath0  for each of the 10 complex c components presented here .",
    "the mrk 290 measurement encompasses two velocity components .",
    "one of the components has much larger @xmath0  and dominates the abundance measurement ; we therefore consider it as effectively one component .",
    "figure 8 does not include the 0.1 dex systematic error from the beam - size mismatch .",
    "because of its importance as an indicator of mixing , we now examine figure 8 for potential metallicity dependence on @xmath0 . the two highest column density components , toward pg  1259 + 593 and mrk  290 , do have the lowest metallicity of @xmath22% solar .",
    "however , owing to the error bars , the statistical significance of a trend is weak .",
    "if we use the column - density weighted mean metallicity ( 0.13 @xmath4 ) , we find a 11% probability that the observed variance in [ / ] vs.   log  @xmath0  occurs purely by chance .",
    "therefore , any slope to the relation of metallicity with @xmath0  is present only at the @xmath381 level . in order to properly assess the metallicity dependence on @xmath0 , it would be desirable to gain more precise measurements along more sight lines , using additional data from _ fuse _  or from the _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ scheduled for 2008 installation on _ hst _ , in order to reduce the error bars on o  i metallicity .",
    "another possible tracer of gas mixing would be a metallicity dependence on galactic latitude . assuming that higher latitude regions of complex c are at larger distance from the galactic plane , it is possible that low - latitude sight lines may pierce regions that are closer to the disk and more highly enriched by solar - metallicity fountain material . referring to a sight - line map of complex c ( e.g. , figure 1 of csg03 ) , such a scenario",
    "is not borne out by the data .",
    "although the two lowest metallicity sight lines are at relatively high latitude , the highest - metallicity sight line , toward mrk 817 , is also at high latitude .",
    "although , the magnitude and variation in sight - line metallicity indicates different degrees of primordial and enriched gas mixing throughout complex c , the signature of mixing versus galactic latitude is not apparent .",
    "an additional issue worth consideration is the nucleosynthetic history of the cloud as revealed by relative abundance patterns .",
    "previous complex c studies have found evidence of @xmath15-element ( s , si , o ) enhancement and nitrogen depletion , indicating that complex c has been enriched primarily by metals produced by type ii sne ( richter et  al .",
    "2001 ; csg03 ; tripp et  al .",
    "these topics can be investigated more fully , now that column densities of and have been measured for several more sight lines .",
    "the consideration of relative abundances instead of absolute abundances has the additional advantage that the problem of uv / radio beam - size mismatch is not applicable . in order to consider relative abundances ,",
    "we have calculated the column - density - weighted abundances of , , , and , relative to .",
    "we only include a sight line s relative abundance if abundances of both of the considered ion species have been measured .",

    ", one must make ionization corrections , defined for example as [ s / h ] = [ s  ii / h  i ] + ( correction ) , where logarithmic quantities are implied .",
    "such corrections are uncertain , because they depend on the gas density and ionizing radiation field .",
    "csg03 calculated such corrections , using the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland et  al .",
    "1998 ; see figure 16 from csg03 ) .",
    "the corrections were negligible for and , which are coupled to through charge exchange . using version 06.02 of cloudy",
    ", we have updated these calculations , constructing a new grid of models with input parameters similar to those described in csg03 , but with relative abundances consistent with ags05 .",
    "the results for o  i and n  i , as well as si  ii , s  ii , and fe",
    "ii are similar to that shown in csg03 for log  @xmath0  down to @xmath388 .",
    "the new sightline , toward mrk 205 , for which log  @xmath0  = 18.1 , will have larger ionization corrections but the limited data available here will not impact our column density weighted results .",
    "the doubly ionized species , , , and , occur in both and regions , and ionization corrections are necessary to properly compare relative abundances involving these singly - ionized species . for si ,",
    "s , and fe , the sign of the correction is negative ( abundances of si , s , and fe are _ less _ than inferred from si  ii / h  i , s  ii / h  i , fe  ii / h  i ) and the magnitude decreases at larger @xmath0 . because the mean relative abundances are weighted by column density , the ionization correction is fairly small for , , and , ranging from 0.10.2 dex , with requiring roughly half the logarithmic correction as and .    considering a rough ionization correction to the above relative ion abundances ,",
    "the @xmath15-elements ( s , si , and o ) have an essentially solar pattern and are slightly enhanced relative to fe .",
    "nitrogen is depleted by a factor of 5 from a solar relative abundance pattern .",
    "the enrichment of @xmath15-elements relative to n and fe suggests that the metals were produced primarily by massive stars and injected into the ism by type ii sne .",
    "nitrogen and iron are typically produced in longer - lived stars , so an @xmath15-enhancement is a signature of gas that has been stripped quickly from the star - forming region .",
    "material ejected from the disk by vigorous sn activity in a galactic fountain , or falling into the disk from galactic winds in local group dwarf galaxies , is consistent with such a scenario .",
    "a plausible explanation , then , for the observed metallicity and abundance pattern is that complex c is mixing with wind / fountain material as it falls onto the milky way disk .",
    "we now have a fairly complete set of upper limits and one reliable detection .",
    "table 9 shows the abundance results for each complex c component .",
    "we have only one reliable complex c detection , toward pg  1259 + 593 ( csg03 ; sembach et  al .",
    "2004 ) , where [ ar  i / h  i ] = @xmath389 ( 9% solar ) with log  @xmath0  = 19.95 relative to an assumed solar abundance ( ar / h)@xmath390 .",
    "many of the other complex c sight lines have lower @xmath0 , insufficient to detect the weak ar  i lines at 1048 and 1066   without extremely long exposures ( pg  1259 + 593 had total exposure @xmath391 ks ) .",
    "however , we should have been able to detect ar  i toward mrk  290 , with log  @xmath0  = 20.12 , but we only measured an upper limit , log  n(ar  i ) @xmath392 , corresponding to [ ar  i / h  i ] @xmath393 ( 7% solar ) .",
    "such low values for [ ar  i / h  i ] are not entirely due to metallicity , as argon probably has a substantial ( positive ) ionization correction .",
    "this effect is similar to that seen ( jenkins et  al .",
    "2000 ) in the local ism toward four white dwarfs , where they found that ar  i is deficient by 0.4 dex , probably because ar  i is more easily ionized than h  i. this effect probably arises ( sofia & jenkins 1998 ) because ar  i has a large photoionization cross section near threshold ( 15.755 ev ) that enhances the abundance in the ar  ii ionization stage . from our grid of photoionization models",
    ", we find that a positive ionization correction is likely appropriate .",
    "for log  @xmath0  @xmath394 , this correction may range from @xmath395 dex to as much as @xmath396 dex if the volume density is as low as @xmath397 @xmath398 .",
    "in addition to allowing a thorough investigation of the ion abundance pattern in complex c , these new data provide the spectral coverage to analyze highly - ionized species . the most useful way to study the high ions is through the comparison of high - ion ratios involving , , , and . in order to carry out such an analysis",

    "owing to their lack of saturation and better detectability , we use the stronger lines of these doublets to calculate column density ratios .",

    "1999 ) and , in turn , a size no larger than a few kpc , photoionization can be ruled out for producing the high ions in complex  c. collisional ionization can produce copious amounts of high ions , while photoionization with a more reasonable ionization parameter can produce the low ions .",

    "collisional ionization by extended ( @xmath410  kpc ) low - density gas requires too much mass and is inconsistent with halo scale lengths .",
    "each of the viable collisional ionization sources requires interaction between complex c and a surrounding environment . for turbulent mixing and conductive heating ,",

    "the high ions toward mrk 876 may trace a decelerating shocked medium at the leading edge of the cloud as it falls through and interacts with the galactic halo .",
    "analysis of the high ions in complex c can also be used to understand the nature of the highly ionized hvcs by comparing to the high ion ratios ( , , , ) presented by csg05 .",
    "although they show a larger spread , the high - ion ratios for the highly ionized hvcs that are detected in singly - ionized species are similar to the values presented in table 11 , suggesting a similar ionization source .",
