    "since its discovery in 1994 by @xcite , the dwarf galaxy has been object of febrile research ; but only recently , thanks to the new data provided by 2mass and sdss , its tidal tails have been studied in great detail @xcite .",
    "the sgr dsph is very important because it gives us a better understanding about the formation process of the milky way and many clues about the shape of its dark matter halo . +",
    "tidal tails are the biggest contributions to the galactic halo @xcite at a radius above 50 kpc @xcite .",
    "many studies have found tidally stripped material associated to this dwarf with an age between 3 and 6.5 gyrs @xcite ; others , suggest that the age of the older debris is between 2 and 4 gyrs @xcite ; furthermore , arc substructures have been found through the galactic south hemisphere at a distance of approximately 40 kpc @xcite ; as well as filaments at a distance of 45 kpc @xcite ; @xmath3 kpc @xcite and @xmath4 kpc @xcite to the galactic center .",
    "these data suggest that has been disrupted since about 6 gyrs .",
    "+ the nearest tidal tails have been found at 18 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "these debris belong to filaments that emerged during the last pericenter passage of the satellite , approximately 0.75 gyrs ago @xcite .",
    "the most recent discoveries about the structure of the tidal tails of the sgr dsph , were done by @xcite and @xcite who found two branches of the stream -the leading and trailing tidal tails- in an area around the north galactic cap .",

    "the nomenclature is referred to : * @xcite , * * @xcite , * * * @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     all of the simulated satellites with plummer radius of 0.6 kpc survive for 10 gyrs and as we can see in figure [ f4 ] , if the satellite is immersed in a dark matter halo of concentration 10 and initial mass of @xmath6 @xmath2 , at least 10% of their initial mass will survive for a hubble time .",
    "+ when we compare the half brightness radius of satellites with plummer radius of 0.6 kpc ( table [ t4 ] ) and 1.2 kpc ( tables [ t4 ] and [ t5 ] ) we can see that only these galaxies reach a value similar to the observed in in some of their stages of evolution .",
    "this suggests that at the beginning of the evolution of this dwarf galaxy , it should have been an extended satellite with a plummer radius larger than 0.5 or 0.6 kpc .",
    "+ the evolution of extended satellites ( plummer radius of 1.2 kpc ) immersed in a dark matter halo is presented in figure [ f5 ] . as we noted before ,",
    "their lifetimes are not higher than 5 gyrs even when their halos are massive and have a concentration parameter of 10 .",
    "since the radii of these dark matter halos can not be larger , because they could produce some notable effects in the milky way , both their initial masses and concentration parameter must be larger than the values used here .",
    "it implies that in order to figure out what was the initial dark matter content of using n body simulations , dynamical friction effects should be taken into account .",

    "conclude through measurements of the total luminosity of the main body and tidal tails of that the initial mass of its dark matter halo was @xmath9 @xmath2 .",

    "we have shown several n body simulations of the evolution of the with and without dark matter . in the simulations of satellites with only barionic matter , we found that very dense satellites are more stable than because during the entire simulation time , that is , 7 gyrs , their masses are always larger than the value measured in . on the other hand , galaxies with initial masses of @xmath15 @xmath2 reproduced the current bound mass of at 6 gyrs .",

    "it was not possible to obtain the entire properties observed in by evolving systems with only a barionic component ; that is why we conclude that the progenitor of should had been immersed in a dark matter halo , as well as the current satellite ; despite the fact that many observational studies have failed in finding observational evidence of dark matter in dwarf galaxies .",
