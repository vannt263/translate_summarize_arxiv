    "the electron fractions are expected to change during the generation phase of the outflows near the base of the outflows .",
    "nevertheless , the electron fraction of the outflow at the base is assumed to be that of the disk at the base  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to evaluate change in the electron fractions of the outflows and to examine nucleosynthesis in a collapsar , we need non steady , multi - dimensional simulations of a collapsar from the collapsing phase of the star to the ejection phase of the outflows from the star .    in the present paper , we propose jets from a collapsar , or rapidly rotating massive star during collapse to the black hole , as a _ new r - process site_. in order to investigate heavy element synthesis in a collapsar , we have calculated detailed composition of magnetically - driven jets ejected from the collapsar , based on long - term , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of a rapidly rotating , magnetized massive star of @xmath29 during core collapse , which has been performed in @xcite recently .",

    "we discuss effects on _ r_-process of our assumptions in a later expansion phase of the ejecta and implications of collapsars for the galactic chemical evolution of _ r_-elements and _ p_-elements in  4 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "we have carried out two - dimensional , newtonian mhd calculation of the collapse of a rotating massive star of 40@xmath0 , whose core is assumed to be collapsed to a black hole promptly .",
    "we present our numerical models and results of the collapsar , in particular , the production and properties of jets .",
    "the numerical code for the mhd calculation employed in this paper is based on the zeus-2d code  @xcite .",
    "we have extended the code to include a realistic eos  @xcite based on the relativistic mean field theory @xcite . for lower density regime ( @xmath31 ) , where no data is available in the eos table with the shen eos , we use another eos  @xcite .",
    "we consider neutrino cooling processes .",
    "the total neutrino cooling rate is evaluated with a simplified neutrino transfer model based on the two - stream approximation  @xcite , with which we can treat the optically thin and thick regimes on neutrino reaction approximately .",
    "we ignore resistive heating , whose properties are highly uncertain , not as in @xcite .",
    "spherical coordinates , ( @xmath32 ) are used in our simulations and the computational domain is extended over @xmath33 and @xmath34 and covered with @xmath35 meshes .",
    "fluid is freely absorbed through the inner boundary of 50 km , which mimics a surface of the black hole , whose mass is continuously increased by the mass of the infalling gas through the inner boundary .",
    "we assume the fluid is axisymmetric and the mirror symmetry on the equatorial plane .",
    "we mimic strong gravity around the black hole in terms of the pseudo - newtonian potential  @xcite .",
    "we set the initial profiles of the density , temperature and electron fraction to those of the spherical model of a 40@xmath0 massive star before the collapse  @xcite .",
    "the radial and azimuthal velocities are set to be zero initially , and increase due to the collapse induced by the central hole and self - gravity of the star .",
    "the computational domain is extended from the iron core to an inner oxygen layer and encloses about 4@xmath0 of the star .",
    "the boundaries of the silicon layers between the iron core and the oxygen layers are located at about 1800 km ( 1.88@xmath0 ) and 3900 km ( 2.4@xmath0 ) , respectively .",
    "we adopt an analytical form of the angular velocity @xmath36 of the star before the collapse : @xmath37 as in the previous study of a collapsar  @xcite and sne  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are parameters of our model .",
    "initial magnetic field , @xmath40 , is assumed to be uniform , parallel to the rotational axis of the star .",
    "we consider case with @xmath41 , @xmath39 = 1000 km , and @xmath42 g , or case with a strongly magnetized progenitor whose core rotates rapidly , because we pay attention to nucleosynthesis of heavy elements , in particular _ r_- and _ p_-elements . as shown in later (  [ sec : abundance - particles ] ) , _ r_-process can operate successfully and some _ p_-elements be synthesized in jets from the star during core collapse .",
    "we briefly describe results of our mhd calculation  @xcite .",
    "lagrangian evolution of physical quantities inside jets , which is important for nucleosynthesis , is shown in  3.1 , in detail .",
    "we find that jets can be magnetically driven from the central region of the star along the rotational axis ; after material reaches to the black hole with high angular momentum of @xmath43 , a disk is formed inside a surface of weak shock , which is appeared near the hole due to the centrifugal force and propagates outward slowly .",
    "the magnetic fields , which are dominated by the toroidal component , are chiefly amplified due to the wrapping of the field inside the disk and propagate to the polar region along the inner boundary near the black hole through the alfvn wave .",
    "eventually , the jets can be driven by the tangled - up magnetic fields at the polar region near the hole at @xmath44 .",
    "we examine nucleosynthesis in a collapsar , based on the results of our mhd simulations .",
    "we firstly show lagrangian evolution of ejecta through jets in detail and then proceed nucleosynthesis inside the jets .      in order to calculate chemical composition of material inside jets ,",
    "we need lagrangian evolution of physical quantities , such as density , temperature , and , velocity of the material .",
    "we adopt a tracer particle method  @xcite to calculate the lagrangian evolution of the physical quantities from the eulerian evolution obtained our mhd calculations of a collapsar .",
    "particles are initially placed from the fe core to an inner o - rich layer .",
    "the numbers of the particles in a layer are weighted to the mass in the layer .",
    "the total numbers of the particles are set to be 1000 , with which we can follow ejecta through the jets appropriately .",
    "we find that 59 particles can be ejected via the jets .",
    "we have performed mhd calculation until @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "after @xmath47 , we assume that particles are adiabatic and expand spherically and freely .",
    "therefore , velocity , position , density , and temperature of a particle are set to be @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , respectively , where @xmath52 is constant in time and set to be @xmath53 .",
    "here @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are velocity , position , density , and temperature of each particle at @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "we briefly discuss how the assumption on the expansion affects abundance change in the expansion phase of the ejecta , later in ",
    "[ sec : expansion - phase ] .    figure [ fig : trajectory ] shows trajectories of ejected particles with low @xmath57 , where @xmath57 is the electron fraction when the temperature of the particle is @xmath58k .",
    "we find that the particles with low @xmath57 are initially located in the fe core ( @xmath59 1800 km ) .",
    "the trajectories of the particles are complex due to convective motion near the equatorial plane  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : rho - t ] shows the evolution of density and temperature . initial density and temperature of a particle is set to be those of the presupernova in a layer where the particle is initially located .",
    "as the particle falls near the hole , the density and temperature increase .",
    "it should be emphasized that some particles become enough high densities ( @xmath60 ) and high temperatures ( @xmath61k ) for protons to capture electrons , as we shall see later . for the particle of @xmath62 ,",
    "the density and temperature stay at high levels during @xmath63-@xmath64 because of convection motion near the black hole ( bottom panel in figure [ fig : trajectory ] ) .",
    "the motion is important for decrease in the electron fraction , as we shall see later ( figure [ fig : ye ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : rho - t ] ( bottom panel ) , the ejecta can attain to high temperature greater than @xmath65 near the black hole , where material is in nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) .",
    "the abundances of the material in nse can be expressed with simple analytical expressions  @xcite , which are specified by @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and the electron fraction as in @xcite .",
    "the electron fraction changes through electron and positron capture on nuclei .",
    "it should be emphasized that changes in the electron fraction through neutrino interactions can be ignored because the material is transparent for neutrinos even in the most dense part of the computational domain  @xcite .    in the relatively cool regime of @xmath68 ,",
    "nse breaks and the chemical composition is calculated with two large nuclear reaction networks , network a and network b , presented in @xcite .",
    "the networks include about 4000 nuclei from neutron and proton up to fermium , whose atomic number , @xmath69 , is 100  ( see table 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "the networks contain reactions such as two and three body reactions , various decay channels , and electron - positron capture .",
    "the experimental masses and reaction rates are adopted if available .",
    "otherwise , theoretical nuclear data , such as nuclear masses , rates of two body reactions , and @xmath3-decays are calculated with mass formula based on frdm in network a but with that based in etfsi in network b. we note that theoretical rates of two body reactions related to nuclei with @xmath70 are same in the two network .",
    "spontaneous and @xmath3-delayed fission is taken into accounts in the both networks . experimental half lives and branching ratios of the spontaneous fission",
    "are taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "theoretical formula of a half life ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 23 ) ) with empirical fission barrier @xcite is adopted for nuclei of @xmath71 without experimental evaluation of the half live .",
    "we note that in @xcite , the half lives through the spontaneous fission are set to be @xmath72 for all nuclei with the mass number , @xmath73 , greater than 254 .",
    "nuclei of @xmath74 decay through sequences of @xmath75 decays and/or fission .",
    "however , in our networks , the nuclei decay only through fission because our networks contain nuclei up to @xmath74 and the @xmath75 channel of the nuclei of @xmath74 shut off artificially .",
    "if we calculate the half life of the nuclei through the fission with the theoritical formula of @xcite , the nuclei , whose half life is long compared with the duration of postprocessing calculation , can not entirely decay .",
    "therefore , for all nuclei of @xmath74 , we tentatively set the half lives through the spontaneous fission to be @xmath76 .",
    "we note that same branching ratios of @xmath3-delayed fission are taken from theoretical evaluation  @xcite in the two networks although the theoretical ratios depend on an adopted mass formula  @xcite .",
    "empirical formula ( * ? ? ? * eq.(5 ) ) is adopted about decay products through the fission .",
    "we note that the distribution of fission yields is asymmetric .",
    "once we obtain the density and temperature evolution of a particle , we can follow abundance evolution of the particle during the infall and ejection , through post - processing calculation using the nuclear reaction network presented in the previous subsection .",
    "the ejected particles are initially located in the iron core ( figure [ fig : trajectory ] ) . as the particles infall near the black hole ,",
    "the particles become hotter than @xmath77 , above which material in the particles is in nse .",
    "we therefore switch to the nse code from the nuclear reaction network to calculate abundance change of the particle . on the other hand , during the ejection , the temperature of the particles decreases and the particle becomes cooler than @xmath77 .",
    "we switch back to the reaction network from the nse code for the post - processing calculation of the particle composition .",
    "we perform the post - processing calculation of nucleosynthesis inside the jets until @xmath78 yr . therefore , almost unstable",
    "nuclei has been decayed to their corresponding stable nuclei .",
    "figure [ fig : ye ] shows evolution of the electron fraction for low @xmath57 particles . for @xmath79 , the electron fractions decrease due to electron capture on nuclei , mainly protons , near the black hole , where density and temperature of the particles are high . on the other hands , for @xmath80 , the electron fractions increase via @xmath75-decays of neutron - rich nuclei in particles with @xmath81 .",
    "the fractions stay nearly constant values at @xmath82 , at which the particles are abundant in neutrons and long lived nuclei with the neutron number around 50 .",
    "@xmath3-decay processes are therefore less important for decrease in the electron fraction at @xmath82 .",
    "we find that there exist particles with @xmath57 lower than 0.3 .",
    "the particles can be so neutron - rich that _ r_-process operates efficiently .",
    "not only a region of high density and temperature but also staying in the region for a long time due to convective motion ( figure [ fig : trajectory ] ) are required for significant decrease in the electron fraction of the particles .",
    "the particle of low @xmath83 has low entropy per baryon ( @xmath84 10 - 20 @xmath85 ) where @xmath85 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the condition is similar to that of ejecta from a massive star of @xmath20 , in which the stellar material is expected to be exploded promptly during sn explosion  @xcite .",
    "the similar condition is also realized in a jet - like explosion from an inner core of a rotating star of 13@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the _ r_-process can operate in the explosion  @xcite but the minimum @xmath57 in the explosion (= 0.158 ) is higher than that in the present study (= 0.10 ) .",
    "therefore , u and th can not be synthesized abundantly in the explosion , not as in the present study , as we shall see later ( figure [ fig : y - z - etfsi ] ) .",
    "we have adopted weak interaction rates as those in @xcite .",
    "however , recent shell - model calculations of the rates  @xcite for nuclei in the mass range @xmath73 = 45 - 65 have resulted in substantial revisions to the old rate set of @xcite . in order to estimate the effects of the revisions on @xmath57 of particles , we have calculated evolution of the electron fraction of the @xmath62 particle using the revised weak interaction rates .",
    "we find that the electron fraction calculated with the revised rates is slightly larger than that with the old rates .",
    "however , the difference in @xmath57 with the two rate sets is only up to two percents .",
    "this is because electrons are dominantly captured by protons and the rates of electron capture on protons are comparable between the two sets of the rates in high temperature and high density regimes .",
    "figure [ fig : particle - abundance - ye ] shows abundances of nuclei with respect to @xmath73 for particles with @xmath57 = 0.10 , 0.23 , 0.30 , and 0.38 using network b. for a lower @xmath57 particle , the particle becomes more neutron - rich in the nse phase , and the abundances of heavier nuclei increase .",
    "we find that the second - peak nuclei ( @xmath86 ) and the third - peak nuclei ( @xmath87 ) can be abundantly produced in particles with @xmath57 less than 0.3 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "we also find that the particle with @xmath57 = 0.10 is abundant in u and th .",
    "the particle has enough low @xmath57 for rapid neutron capture to proceed efficiently .",
    "we find that the nuclear flow on the nuclear chart proceeds near the neutron drip line and heavy neutron - rich nuclei with @xmath88 are abundantly synthesized in the particle ( figure [ fig : nuclear - chart ] ) .",
    "therefore , nuclear properties of mass model , @xmath3-decay , and fission , for nuclei near the drip line are important for abundance calculation of the @xmath89 particle .    we have taken into accounts spontaneous and @xmath3-delayed fission in our nuclear reaction networks .",
    "fission is expected to have important role in the composition of particles with low @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ fig : particle - abundance - fission ] shows the abundances of the particle with @xmath57 = 0.10 calculated with network b and a network same as in network b but ignored all fission processes .",
    "we find that the abundances of nuclei with @xmath90 as well as those with @xmath91 change significantly if the fission processes are ignored .",
    "this is due to decay through fission and fission yields , whose mass numbers are abundantly distributed in @xmath91 .",
    "we note that fission recycling can not take place in the particle .",
    "finally , in order to see dependence of particle composition on a nuclear mass model , we present the composition of particles with @xmath57 = 0.10 and 0.23 using network a and b in figure [ fig : particle - abundance - mass ] .",
    "we find that overall abundance profiles are similar for the two networks for the both particles .",
    "detailed profiles are , however , rather different for the two networks . for the @xmath92 particle ,",
    "it is remarkable that heavy elements , such as pb , th , and u , with network b are more abundant than network a.    the time - scale of a reaction sequence , which synthesizes heavy neutron - rich nuclei greater than @xmath93 , mainly depends on half lives of the waiting - point nuclei of _",

    "we note that the ratio in the sne is problematically much smaller compared with that in the solar system  @xcite .",

    "a current grb rate is estimated to be @xmath164 in the milky way  @xcite .",
    "a grb rate in an average galaxy is comparable to that in the galaxy and is much smaller than the rate of core - collapse sne by a factor of several hundreds  @xcite .",

    "the rate rapidly increases at red shift @xmath165 and is gradually enhanced at higher red shift  @xcite . however , an estimated star formation rate is constant at higher red shift , though the rate increases at @xmath165 as the grb rate  @xcite .",
    "thus , the relative grb rate to core - collapse sne enlarges at the higher @xmath166 .",
    "moreover , the jets in the current investigation are too slow ( @xmath167 ) and heavy ( @xmath168 ) to induce grb . although this `` failed grb '' is possibly hard to observe compared with normal grbs , two failed grbs are suggested to be associated with type ic sne , sn2001em  @xcite and sn2002ap  @xcite . a ratio of failed grbs to type ic sne",

    "accordingly , we can estimate a failed grb rate to @xmath172 with an estimate of a type ibc rate of @xmath173  @xcite .",
    "therefore , failed grbs are possibly more frequent than normal grbs .    in brief",
