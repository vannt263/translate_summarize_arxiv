    "quantum states formally represent the addressable information content about the system they describe . during their evolution quantum systems may suffer the presence of noise , for instance due to the interaction with another system , generally referred as an external environment .",
    "this may cause a loss of information on the system , and leads to a modification from its initial to its final state . in quantum communication theory , stochastic channels , that is completely positive trace preserving ( cpt )",
    "mappings , provide a formal description of the noise affecting the system during its evolution .",
    "the most detrimental form of noise from the point of view of quantum information , is described by the so - called entanglement breaking ( eb ) maps @xcite .",
    "these maps when acting on a given system destroy any entanglement that was initially present between the system itself and an arbitrary external ancilla .",
    "accordingly they can be simulated as a two  stage process where a first party makes a measurement on the input state and sends the outcome , via a classical channel , to a second party who then re - prepares the system of interest in a previously agreed state  @xcite .    for continuous variable quantum systems",
    "@xcite , like optical or mechanical modes , there is a particular class of cpt maps which is extremely important : the class of gaussian channels @xcite .",
    "almost every realistic transmission line ( _ e.g. _  optical fibers , free space communication , _ etc .",
    "_ ) can be described as a gaussian channel . in this context",
    "the notion of eb channels has been introduced and characterized in ref .",
    "gaussian channels , even if they are not entanglement breaking , usually degrade quantum coherence and tend to decrease the initial entanglement of the state @xcite .",
    "one may try to apply error correction procedures based on gaussian encoding and decoding operations acting respectively on the input and output states of the map plus possibly some ancillary systems .",
    "this however has been shown to be useless @xcite , in the sense that gaussian procedures can not augment the entanglement transmitted through the channel ( no - go theorem for gaussian quantum error correction ) . here",
    "we point out that such lack of effectiveness does nt apply when we allow gaussian recovering operations to act _ between _ two successive applications of the same map on the system .",
    "specifically our approach is based on the notion of _ amendable channels _ introduced in @xcite , whose definition derives from the generalization of the class of eb maps ( gaussian and not ) to the class of eb channels of order @xmath0 .",
    "the latter are maps @xmath1 which , even if not necessarily eb , become eb after @xmath0 iterative applications on the system ( in other words , indicating with  @xmath2 \" the composition of super - operator , @xmath1 is said to be eb of order @xmath0 if @xmath3 is eb while @xmath4 is not ) .",
    "we therefore say that a map is amendable if it is eb of order 2 , and there exists a second channel ( called _ filtering _ map ) such that when interposed between the two actions of the initial map , prevents the global one to be eb . in this context",
    "we show that there exist gaussian eb channels of order @xmath5 which are amendable through the action of a proper gaussian unitary filter ( i.e. whose detrimental action can be stopped by performing an intermediate , recovering gaussian transformation ) .",

    ". this transformation can be described in terms of a coupling between the system and a thermal bosonic bath with mean photon number @xmath42 , mediated by a beam splitter of transmissivity @xmath43 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the eb properties of the maps @xmath37 under channel iteration were studied as a function of the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for completeness",

    "it is a well known fact that a map @xmath1 is eb if and only if when applied to one side of a maximally entangled state it produces a separable state  @xcite .",

    "another compelling isuee would be determining a complete characterization of amendable gaussian maps of second or higher order .",
    "we recall that , according to the definition introduced in @xcite , a map @xmath1 is amendable of order @xmath209 , if @xmath208 and it is possible to delay its detrimental effect by @xmath210 steps by applying the same intermediate unitary filter after successive applications of the channel .",
    "one possible outlook in this direction would be to allow the choice of different filters at each error correction step and determine an optimization procedure over the filtering maps .",
    "of course this analysis would be extremely difficult to be performed for arbitrary noisy maps .",
    "a first step would be to focus on set of the gaussian maps using the conservation of the gaussian character under combinations among them and their very simple composition rules to perform this analysis .          s. l. braunstein and p. van loock , rev .",
