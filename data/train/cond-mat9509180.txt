    "we consider a one  dimensional system of @xmath3 elastic rods with mass density @xmath4 and elastic module @xmath5 .",
    "the elastic state of the @xmath6th particle at time @xmath7 is described by the longitudinal strain field @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the internal position coordinate and @xmath10 is the length of the one  dimensional rod . in order to seperate internal and translational degrees of freedom",
    "the strain field contains only fluctuations , i.e. @xmath11 , while homogeneous distortions contribute to the center of mass coordinate @xmath12 of the particle . on collision",
    "adjacent particles interact via a potential @xmath13 , which depends only on the current end  to  end distance of the _ distorted _ rods @xmath14 , where @xmath15 . in the present calculations we investigate an exponential interaction potential with characteristic length scale @xmath16 @xmath17 which includes for large @xmath18 the limit of a hard core potential .",
    "the constant @xmath19 can be chosen arbitrarily , since changing its value merely corresponds to a rescaling of the relativ coordinates @xmath20 .",
    "we expand the strain fields @xmath21 in sine and cosine normal modes with amplitudes @xmath22 and normal frequencies @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the speed of sound .",
    "if we denote conjugate moments by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , and treat the elastic energy in harmonic approximation , the hamiltonian reads  @xcite : @xmath27 here we assume periodic boundary conditions , i.e. place the particles on a ring with perimeter @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 and @xmath30 . because of the nonlinear coupling between oscillator modes our model has some resemblance with the classical fermi  pasta ",
    "ulam  ( fpu ) problem  @xcite .",
    "the important difference is that here the interaction is `` switched '' on and off depending on the relative distance of the translational coordinates : as long as a particle is not involved in a collision , all its vibrational modes are effectively decoupled .",
    "we now confine ourselves to two  particle collisions and consider the case @xmath31 : in the center of mass frame we introduce the reduced mass @xmath32 and an effective length scale @xmath33 . taking @xmath34 normal modes for each particle",
    "we numerically integrate the equations of motion resulting from the hamiltonian  ( [ hamilton ] ) .",
    "the following scenario is considered : we start with an initial relative velocity @xmath35 and place the particles at maximum distance , @xmath36 .",
    "we concentrate on the hard core limit @xmath37 and set the initial temperature of the bath of oscillators equal to zero : @xmath38 .",
    "the system now undergoes an infinite series of collisions with the two particles colliding alternately at either ends .",
    "we observe a rapid decrease of @xmath39 , the kinetic energy of the relative coordinate .",
    "1 displays a decay of @xmath40 over a range of approximately 100 collisions until a stationary state is reached with the kinetic energy fluctuating around an equilibrium value @xmath41 , that is , of course , essentially zero for large @xmath34 .",
    "we interprete this phenomenon as a spreading of the translational energy among _ all _ degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "this view is supported by a statistical analysis of the distribution of vibrational energies : denoting modal energies by @xmath42 we define the energy of the oscillator bath as @xmath43 . after a transient time",
    "we calculate the relative modal energies @xmath44 after each collision and take the average .",
    "( due to the continuous interchange of energy between transational and vibrational modes @xmath45 itself is a dynamical quantity . )",
    "the resulting energy spectrum ( inset of fig .",
    "1 ) shows a homogeneous partition of vibrational energies .",
    "this is what we shall call _ modal equipartition regime _ in the following .",
    "( for particular values of @xmath46 , the length ratio of the rods , we found a periodic structure underlying the spectra .",
    "this subtlety does not affect the main results of this section , however . )",
    "we have also investigated the distribution function of @xmath47 ( @xmath6 and @xmath48 fixed ) and always observed an excellent agreement with the boltzmann distribution .",
    "an important question is , how fast the modal equipartition regime is reached .",
    "does the relaxation time ( measured by the number of collisions ) scale with @xmath34 ?",
    "a sensitive probe of equipartition is the normalized spectral entropy @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which was first introduced in numerical studies on the fpu problem@xcite .",
    "if equipartition takes place , @xmath52 will decay from its initial value @xmath53 to its equilibrium value @xmath54 ( for boltzmann distributed @xmath47 one finds@xcite @xmath55 ) .",
    "our plot of @xmath52 for different numbers of modes ( fig .",
    "2 ) suggests a relaxation time of approximately 20 collisions , essentially _",
    "independent _ of @xmath34 .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "1 shows that the time scale for modal equipartition is considerably shorter than the relaxation time of the granular cooling process .",
    "we are now going to discuss in detail a single two ",
    "particle collision in the modal equipartition regime .",
    "let us denote the precollisional and post  collisional relative velocity of the particles by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively",
    ". in our model the coefficient of restitution @xmath58 is a stochastic quantity ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) and",
    "the collision process is described by a _",
    "differential equation .",
    "if modal equipartition is valid , we can apply the usual concepts of statistical physics and consider the precollisional values of the internal coordinates as independent , boltzmann distributed variables ( with bath temperature @xmath59 ) . note that this choice of initial conditions is equivalent to imposing a markov approximation on the collisional dynamics , since correlations with preceeding collision events are neglected .",
    "obviously , the coefficient of restitution contains the complete information about the energy transfer between @xmath60 and @xmath0 : due to conservation of total energy we have @xmath61 and @xmath62 after collision . in order to derive the equation of motion for",
    "the translational coordinate it is convenient to introduce the following scaled variables : @xmath63 ( scaled physical time),@xmath64 , @xmath65 ( initial distance ) , and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , scaled initial velocity ) .",
    "again we are mainly interested in the hard core limit so that now @xmath68 is our large control parameter .",
    "furthermore we set the free constant @xmath69 .",
    "the internal coordinates in hamilton s equations of motion can be integrated out@xcite using green s function method and we arrive at the following equation for @xmath70 , the _ velocity increase _ throughout collision : @xmath71 with @xmath72 . the coefficient of restitution is then obtained from the asymptotics of @xmath73 : @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ sde ] ) @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the periods of the lowest normal modes in scaled time and @xmath77 are gaussian stochastic processes resulting from the initial conditions .",
    "they take on the form of stochastic fourier series @xmath78 with independent and identically distributed gaussian coefficients @xmath79 . as a consequence",
    ", we have @xmath80\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath81 and periodic continuation everywhere else .",
    "the periodicity of the correlation function and the memory terms in eq .",
    "( [ sde ] ) reflect the fact , that we consider a system of _ ideal _ oscillators that never forgets its collision history .",
    "note that typical fluctuations of the noise processes are of the same order as @xmath82 , which makes an analytical treatment even more difficult .",
    "however , it is possible to solve the deterministic equation ( @xmath2 ) : in the large @xmath83 regime the coefficient of restitution is essentially given by the length ratio @xmath84:@xmath85 , and the actual collision takes place in the time intervall @xmath86 , i.e. the duration of the collision is equal to the wave propagation time of the shorter rod .",
    "these results are in agreement with the wave theory of impact  @xcite , that analyzes the collision problem in terms of stress waves propagating through the rods . to our knowledge ,",
    "a derivation in the framework of classical mechanics ( with correction terms for finite @xmath83 ) has not been given before .",
    "for @xmath87 we had to integrate eq.([sde ] ) numerically and average over many realizations of the noise processes .",
    "we have focussed on the statistics of @xmath88 , since it is the relevant quantity for energy transfer . in the hard core regime (",
    "@xmath83 larger than @xmath89 ) the probability density of @xmath88 , @xmath90 , does not significantly depend on @xmath83 , but it is still a function of @xmath91 and @xmath84 .",
    "recall that eq .",
    "( [ sde ] ) describes a _ single _ collision , given the _",
    "current _ values of @xmath40 and @xmath0 . after collision",
    "the energy ratio has changed to @xmath92 ( see above ) and in turn there is a different distribution of @xmath88 at the next collision .",
    "3 displays plots of the distribution function for different values of the parameters .",
    "the important point is that @xmath90 has to be interpreted as a _ transition density _ : in the context of the markov approximation leading to eqs.([sde]),([cf ] ) , the time evolution of @xmath40 ( cf . fig .",
    "1 ) is simply a markovian jump process in discrete `` time '' ( i.e. cumulative number of collisions ) .",
    "if the system is in a state with energy @xmath40 , the probability density for a transition to energy @xmath93 is determined by @xmath94 as expected , the transition density resulting from eq.([sde ] ) can be shown numerically to yield a stationary energy density @xmath95 . in view of the many  particle problem",
    "( see below ) it seems reasonable to replace the exact distribution of @xmath88 by a simpler one , that obeys detailed balance and leads to the same stationary density @xmath96 .",
    "a possible choice , for example , is the analog of glauber dynamics@xcite for ising spin systems : @xmath97",
    "for the many  particle system translational energy and bath temperature become functions of time _ and _ position . from the preceeding sections it is clear that each two  particle collision tends to establish a state where _ locally _ @xmath98 . as in the case @xmath99",
    ", we assume modal equipartition for each particle and treat collisions in the markov approximation .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the cooling properties of the system will not sensitively depend on the detailed form of the probability density @xmath90 .    for computer simulations we therefore suggest an algorithm that is a combination of ed and monte carlo methods : each of the @xmath3 particles",
    "is assigned an individual bath temperature @xmath100 that characterizes its vibrational state .",
    "for each collision the following steps have to be performed : ( 1 ) calculate the next collision event by the ed procedure .",
    "( 2 ) for the colliding pair determine @xmath40 and an averaged local bath temperature @xmath0 .",
    "( 3 ) with these parameters choose @xmath1 randomly from a simple distribution , e.g.  @xmath101 .",
    "( 4 ) update the relative velocities and the post  collisional values of @xmath100 ; go back to ( 1 ) .",
    "another possible extension of our study would be a generalization of the inelastic boltzmann equation @xcite to a stochastic coefficient of restitution .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
    "this work has strongly benefitted from the cooperation and many helpfull discussions with annette zippelius and reiner kree .",
