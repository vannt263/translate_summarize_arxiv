    "in this contribution , i review the present status of the madloop  @xcite and amc@nlo  @xcite projects , whose aim is computing observables at the next to leading order ( nlo ) accuracy at high energy colliders .",
    "both tools are based on the strategic assumption that , for the word _",
    "automation _ to have its proper meaning , the only operation required from a user is that of typing - in the process to be computed , and other analysis - related information ( such as final - state cuts ) . in particular",
    ", the codes that achieve the _ automation _ may only differentiate between processes depending on their general characteristics , but must never work on a case - by - case basis .    in section  [ sec:1",
    "] , i review the general structure of a typical nlo calculation and the computational strategies implemented in madloop .",
    "section  [ sec:2 ] describes the amc@nlo framework while , in section  [ sec:3 ] , i report on three phenomenological studies relevant at the lhc .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:4 ] , i discuss the ongoing work to extend the applicability of such automatic tools to linear collider physics .",
    "the typical structure of a nlo calculation is given by the following formula : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the born cross section , @xmath2 is the virtual 1-loop correction , @xmath3 is the real correction , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the _ unintegrated _ and _ integrated _ counterterms , respectively , which allow to compute the real contribution in 4 dimensions .",
    "the complexity of the calculation grows up rapidly with the number of external legs , especially in the sector of the 1-loop corrections .",
    "since any 1-loop amplitude @xmath6 can be decomposed in terms of known scalar 1-loop functions @xmath7 the problem is fully solved once one determines the set of coefficients @xmath8 that is obtained in madloop with the opp approach  @xcite , in which the natural object is the _ integrand _ of the virtual 1-loop amplitude @xmath9 for example , in the case of a @xmath10 process , @xmath11 can be cast in the form @xmath12 where the @xmath13 denote numerator functions of all possible structures with @xmath14 denominators .",
    "the coefficients in equation  [ eq : coeff ] are obtained in madloop by sampling numerically the numerators @xmath13 ( considered as functions of the would - be loop momentum @xmath15 ) with the help of cuttools  @xcite . since @xmath13 are tree - level like objects , they are suitable to be computed with madgraph , which is the tool used by madloop for their numerical determination .",
    "one - loop amplitudes for @xmath16 processes are constructed in madloop by sewing _ tree - level _ @xmath17 diagrams ( dubbed l - cut diagrams ) where one special line l is opened .",
    "then amplitudes are formed by discarding one - loop diagrams in excess , a process that we call _ diagram filtering_. due to the 1-loop topology , two l - cut diagrams must be considered equivalent if they are identical up to a cyclic permutation , or to mirror symmetry , or to a cyclic permutation plus mirror symmetry .",
    "an example of l - cut diagram , identified with the string @xmath18 is given in figure  [ openloop ] .",
    "the following 2 strings are equivalent to that one depicted in figure  [ openloop ] @xmath19    it is easy to convince oneself that , when computing qcd corrections , the l - cut processes one needs to consider correspond to the following choices of the l - cut particles : @xmath20 in general theories , the l - cuts processes corresponding to all particles in the lagrangian should be taken into account .",
    "amc@nlo is a fully automated approach to complete event generation and subsequent parton shower at the nlo accuracy in qcd , which allows accurate and flexible simulations for both signals and backgrounds at hadron colliders .",
    "all calculational aspects in amc@nlo are automated .",
    "one - loop contributions are evaluated with madloop as described in the previous section .",
    "the other matrix - element contributions to the cross sections appearing in equation  [ nlocalc ] , their phase - space subtractions according to the fks formalism  @xcite , their combinations with the one - loop results , and their integration are performed by madfks  @xcite .",
    "the matching of the nlo results with herwig  @xcite or pythia  @xcite parton showers is performed with the mc@nlo method  @xcite , and it is also completely automatic .",
    "an important aspect of the above procedure is that all the ingredients of equation  [ nlocalc ] can be computed independently and put together to produce physical results in a subsequent stage .    as an example of the use and validation of our automatic tools we report , in table  [ tab : results ] , parton level results obtained with madfks and madloop .",
    ".[tab : results ] results for total rates , possibly within cuts , at the 7  tev lhc , obtained with madfks and madloop .",
    "the errors are due to the statistical uncertainty of monte carlo integration .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,<,^,^ , > , < , > , < \" , ]      herwig ( solid black ) and pythia ( dashed blue ) results .",
    "the rescaled @xmath21 contributions with herwig ( open black boxes ) and pythia ( open blue circles ) are shown separately .",
    "middle insets : scale ( dashed red ) and pdf ( solid black ) fractional uncertainties .",
    "lower insets : amc@nlo/(amc@nlo+@xmath21 ) with herwig ( solid black ) and pythia ( dashed blue).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]   herwig ( solid black ) and pythia ( dashed blue ) results .",
    "the rescaled @xmath21 contributions with herwig ( open black boxes ) and pythia ( open blue circles ) are shown separately .",
    "middle insets : scale ( dashed red ) and pdf ( solid black ) fractional uncertainties .",
    "lower insets : amc@nlo/(amc@nlo+@xmath21 ) with herwig ( solid black ) and pythia ( dashed blue).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "automatic tools such as those described in the previous sections can be successfully employed for studying ilc / clic @xmath22 physics as well . however , for this to be achieved in practice , a number of intermediate technical challenges should be dealt with .",
    "if , on the one hand , the treatment of the real radiation is much easier due to the much simpler initial state , on the other hand , the need of including the full set of electroweak 1-loop corrections could pose a problem in terms of speed due to the much larger number of contributing feynman diagrams .",
    "if , in addition , one wishes to study susy or generic bsm models at linear colliders including radiative corrections , things can become too slow .",
    "however , one should not forget that the intrinsic simplicity of the algorithms used in madloop and amc@nlo is , at a very large extent , independent on the complexity of the process under study and that the results are always guaranteed to be correct thanks to the complete automation of the whole procedure .",
    "therefore , simple cashing strategies and a clever organization of the calculation can be used to deal with such cpu challenging computations .",
    "finally , the fact that both madloop and amc@nlo are embedded into the madgraph framework guarantees a dedicated and constant work in the direction of extending them to theories more complicated than qcd .",
    "for example , the complete electroweak standard model in the renormalizable gauge is being currently implemented in madgraph5 , together with the ultraviolet counterterms and the needed so called @xmath23 finite renormalization  @xcite .",
    "work is also in progress for susy and bsm theories  @xcite .",
    "physics at the next - to - leading order accuracy should be easy and the tools dedicated to its study at high - energy colliders user friendly . in order to allow a quick progress in our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature ,",
    "the human effort should be better employed to compare easily produced theoretical predictions with data .",
