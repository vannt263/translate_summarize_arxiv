    "the @xmath6 spin splitting can be caused by the bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) of the underlying crystal structure @xcite as well as by the structure inversion asymmetry ( sia ) due to , e.g. , an electric field @xmath7 perpendicular to the plane of the 2d system .",

    "note that we can not call the spin - split branches @xmath12 of the energy surface spin - up or spin - down because the direction of @xmath13 varies as a function of @xmath1 such that averaged over all occupied states the branches contain equal contributions of up and down spinor components .",

    "it is advantageous to have a small spin relaxation in the semiconducting channel because spin relaxation is competing with the controlled spin precession in the channel .",

    "we remark that an all - inclusive investigation of this question should explicitely evaluate spin relaxation as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath13 .",
    "in general , the total @xmath6 spin splitting in inversion asymmetric 2d systems is determined by an interplay of spin splitting due to bia , which is always present in systems with a zinc blende structure , and the tunable spin splitting due to sia .",
