    "the gardner equation appeared a long time ago when miura @xcite introduced the remarkable transformation u = v^2 + v_x , [ miura ] connecting the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation , @xmath0 , to the modified kdv ( mkdv ) equation , @xmath1 .",
    "both equations are ideal prototypes for integrable models .",
    "the transformation is highly nontrivial and relates solutions of the two nonlinear equations .",
    "miura @xcite pointed out that the kdv equation is invariant under galilean transformation .",
    "in fact , if we change the coordinates according to [ galileu0 ] x + a , t , a= , then @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the kdv equation becomes @xmath4 .",
    "the undesirable @xmath5 term on the left hand side is canceled by the nonlinear term @xmath6 on the right hand side , by a constant shift in the field variable .",
    "therefore , the kdv equation is invariant under the transformation ( [ galileu0 ] ) with u(x , t ) u ( , ) + a. following the same idea for the mkdv equation we get @xmath7 . because of the quadratic term in the nonlinearity , a constant shift in the field can still remove the undesirable @xmath8 term , but at the cost of an extra nonlinear one .",

    "[ galileu ] is evidently interesting because it may be considered as combination of the kdv and mkdv equations or as an integrable deformation of the kdv or mkdv equations . in a sequence of three papers ,",
    "wadati @xcite obtained the solution using the inverse scattering transform , b \" acklund transformation and showed that is indeed a completely integrable hamiltonian system .",
    "it is known that integrable soliton equations appear as members of a more general structure called integrable hierarchies . in @xcite",
    "the results previously obtained for the kdv equation individually were generalized to the whole kdv hierarchy and its deformation related to the gardner transformation was discussed .",
    "the properties of the gardner equation is fairly well known and can be obtained through the properties of the mkdv equation , and is subject of current research @xcite . besides the mathematical interest , equation has a wide application in atmospheric and ocean waves and was extensively studied by grimshaw @xcite where they obtained the large - amplitude table - top solitons , often observed in ocean coastal zones , and breathers @xcite .",
    "recently , solutions of the gardner equation were used to construct static solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation , known to describe dynamics of bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "a general algebraic approach for the construction of integrable hierarchies and its solitonic solutions can be formulated in terms of representation of affine lie algebras .",
    "the soliton solutions can be systematically constructed by the dressing method , which connects a trivial ( vanishing ) vacuum to a nontrivial soliton solution employing vertex operators .",
    "see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "the transformation , connecting solutions of the gardner and mkdv equations , clearly shows that both solutions have different boundary values due to a constant shift in the field variable .",
    "this implies that both equations have different vacuum solutions .",
    "in particular , those solutions of the gardner hierarchy with trivial vacuum are related to nonvanishing vacuum solutions of mkdv equation and vice - versa .    in @xcite",
    "we have extended the mkdv hierarchy for negative flows by introducing negative even graded lax pairs .",
    "the nonlinear equations within that class do not present solutions with vanishing boundary condition and , in order to circumvent this problem , a deformed vertex operator was introduced .",
    "the present paper is a natural continuation of @xcite in which the same algebraic formulation is employed to construct solutions of the gardner equation .",
    "interesting solutions arises where a table - top soliton or a kink can coexist with normal solitons .",
    "we also obtain dark solitons , breathers and the wobble @xcite solutions .    in sections 2 and 3",
    "we briefly introduce the kdv and mkdv hierarchies , respectively , and show that miura transformation represents a map between both hierarchies and not only between two single equations .",
    "our main results are contained in section 4 where we propose a deformed hierarchy grounded on @xmath10 kac - moody algebra , containing the gardner equation as one of its members . in section 5",
    "we introduce a new vertex operator and in section 6 , construct explicit solutions for the whole hierarchy .",
    "concluding remarks are in section 7 .",
    "following @xcite , the mathematical construction of the kdv hierarchy can be introduced by the lax equation in terms of pseudo - differential operators l_t = [ l^n/2_+ , l ] , n=1,3,5,  [kdv - hierarchy ] where @xmath11 is the schr \" odinger operator .",
