    "the dynamics of multimode lasers has occupied a prime place in the investigation of laser behaviour since , starting from their first realizations  @xcite , lasers operated on several longitudinal ( and at times transverse ) cavity modes .",
    "indeed , only with further work did it become possible to restrict the operation to one longitudinal and transverse mode oscillation .",
    "thus , questions on the correct modeling of the interaction between several ( longitudinal ) modes and the active medium were vigorously debated very early on .",
    "one of the first and most successful proposals for a satisfactory description of laser dynamics came from tang , statz and de mars  @xcite who introduced a model ",
    "widely used up until today  which treats the individual cavity mode intensities as directly coupled to the energy reservoir ( population inversion ) , independently of one another .",
    "the question of mutual coupling among modes was effectively solved in a later seminal paper  @xcite .    since the early work , multimode dynamics has generally been extensively studied either because of its intrinsic features , for the regular or irregular temporal oscillations which accompany it , or because of the disruption that it may cause whenever high spectral purity is required .",
    "one particular regime has , however , attracted particular attention because of its peculiar features : the so - called antiphase regime . under this mode of operation ,",
    "several longitudinal laser modes oscillate , but are mutually coupled in such a way as to phase - lock , thereby maintaining a constant total output power . in the simplest configuration",
    "such a behaviour was observed in two - mode lasers  @xcite , but its full impact was appreciated only with the very first attempts at building efficient frequency - doubled lasers  @xcite , followed by detailed investigations of the dynamical properties of antiphase states  @xcite .",
    "the modal picture is somewhat different when one examines the operation of semiconductor lasers .",
    "devices which are capable of multi - longitudinal mode operation ( i.e. , in - plane geometries , whether bulk , guided , or quantum well junctions ) are extremely sensitive to any form of external feedback . aside from large levels of re - injection , introduced for stabilization purposes , practically any amount of reinjection",
    " no matter how small  causes a destabilization of the laser output which manifests itself in the form of low - frequency - fluctuations  @xcite , mode - hopping  @xcite , coherent collapse  @xcite , and fast phase jumps  @xcite with antiphase oscillations during the fast transient which wash out the details of the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "an early overview  @xcite of the different regimes , which predates their detailed investigations , and a summary  @xcite provide a useful global picture .",
    "noise dominates the multimode semiconductor laser dynamics and , as such , models have concentrated on the most appropriate ways of introducing its influence on the dynamical evolution .",
    "a thorough analysis of the influence of noise on the operation of a semiconductor laser and on the associated fluctuations was reported by henry  @xcite , while a review of the different physical sources of noise in a semiconductor laser has been given by osiski and buus  @xcite .",
    "phenomenological multimode rate equations have been devised  @xcite which account for mode partition  @xcite ( a regime where the instantaneous laser power is randomly distributed among several simultaneous modes ) or mode hopping  @xcite ( instantaneous oscillation on an individual mode , with random jumps among modes ) .    in 2004 new experimental results  @xcite demonstrated that the general picture , put together over the course of two decades , where multimode semiconductor laser dynamics is driven and controlled by noise , was incomplete .",
    "indeed , measurements performed on a multiple quantum well ( mqw ) device conclusively showed that a new kind of dynamics exists , at least for some devices , where the laser emission is composed of a regular , cyclic alternation of modes phase - locked in such a way as to maintain constant the power output by the device  @xcite . among various other oscillatory regimes with mixed features ( e.g. , partial modulation of the total laser power )",
    ", the most unusual one corresponds to a modal switching dynamics nearly devoid of a modulation of the total output , but with full modulation in the modal , frequency - resolved emission , with a sequence starting from the bluest mode and evolving towards the reddest mode ; once the last mode in the active range is reached , the sequence restarts from the bluest mode following the same regular features ( with emission times and mode transitions which depend on the pairs of modes )  @xcite .",
    "another experiment followed  @xcite which showed a dynamical regime with substantially the same features , although much more complex , in an entirely different device : a multilongitudinal mode quantum dot laser ( qdl ) .",
    "these observations proved that the deterministic regime is not exclusive to mqw devices and that its origin must be sought outside the physical characteristics of mqws .",
    "the regular , deterministic dynamics entirely contrasted with the stochastic picture of all previous observations and demanded a new kind of physical description for its interpretation . to this end",
    ", new phenomenological multimode rate equation models were constructed , which included the interaction among modes through four - wave - mixing ( fwm )  @xcite , cross - saturation ( cs ) and self - saturation ( ss )  @xcite . in this approach , coupling among modes is phenomenologically introduced on the basis of physical considerations , and a satisfactory reproduction of the main observations is achieved without the need for introducing noise .",
    "thus , determinism is recovered through the introduction of mode - coupling and excluding noise from the mathematical description of the system .",
    "an interesting alternative approach  @xcite , cited also in the first experimental report  @xcite , makes a choice opposite to the usual one  @xcite by introducing noise at the level of the global electric field ( i.e. , the total field contributed by all modes ) .",
    "this choice automatically introduces a form of intermodal coupling , through noise , which is thereby partitioned onto each modal intensity . in this approach , while the _ global _ noise is a random process , the _ individual noise component _ , i.e. the instantaeous noise projected onto each individual mode , introduces a correlation between the fluctuations of different modes .",
    "this choice is unusual and shows that determinism can be recovered through correlations , even though the underlying source of correlation is a random process .",
    "summarizing , some kind of laser devices are capable of showing deterministic modal dynamics , accompanied , in some regimes , by a constant power output , which indicates modal phase - locking .",
    "modeling has been achieved either through multimode deterministic rate equations modified to phenomenologically include mode coupling , or though equivalent multimode equations ( without mode coupling ) including noise introduced for the global field ( partitioned among the individual modes ) .",
    "following the publication of the experimental results  @xcite , a more advanced form of modelling was introduced where the medium s susceptibility , which can be expressed in an approximate analytical form  @xcite , was explicitely used to obtain coupled partial differential equations ( pdes ) which describe the evolution of the electric field and of the carrier density  @xcite .",
    "this modeling choice represents the most sophisticated approach developed up until our contribution  @xcite and contains several similarities .",
    "we are therefore going to closely analyse this model , interpret its different components , comment on its predictions and compare them to those we obtain  @xcite .",
    "the model derived by serrat and masoller  @xcite describes the evolution of the laser field , in interaction with the carriers of a semiconducting material , in a bidirectional ring cavity .",
    "their starting point is the same as the one we take  @xcite , i.e. , the wave equation for the electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "field coupled to a formally described polarization for the source term , together with the evolution equation for the carrier density .",
    "however , the adiabatic elimination ( ae ) of the polarization variable and the slowly varying envelope approximation ( svea ) , together with the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , are assumed to hold  @xcite .",
    "thus , the equations for the slowly varying field amplitudes , in the two counterpropagating directions , are directly written out .",
    "in addition , the frequency dependence of the susceptibility is described phenomenologically in the parabolic approximation  @xcite thereby fixing all the physical functional dependencies .",
    "the parabolic approximation , commonly used for semiconductor models  @xcite , forces a symmetric lineshape around the lasing frequency and thereby misses a crucial point ( cf .",
    "( [ betadef ] ) ) in the description of the phase instability ( cf .",
    "( [ eigenv]-[alphabeta ] ) ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are introduced  @xcite , together with finite mirror reflectivity , to take into account the role of the ( ring ) cavity .",
    "rewritten in a notation more similar to ours , the model  @xcite reads : @xmath0f \\ , , \\\\",

    "it is important to notice a fundamental difference between the results that we show below and those previously reported  @xcite , where the authors performed a reduction of the predicted field evolution by projecting the total intensity onto a set of cavity modes .",

    "this choice of information reduction was justified  @xcite by the limited bandwidth encountered in experiments ( at least at the time when they were conducted ) which prevented the detection of the intermode beats .",

    "( [ serratequations1]-[serratequations3 ] ) . in other terms , @xmath47 is strictly zero ( by construction ) in the sm model , which definitively excludes the possibility of appearence of a phase instability regime .",
    "we conclude that , although the two models ( sm and cd2 ) are structurally identical ",
    "i.e. , contain the same leading terms  , the nature of one of their parameters is different . while the coefficient in front of the diffraction term ( second line of eq .",
    "( [ smrewritten1 ] ) ) is complex in the cd2 model , in the sm model it is strictly real .",
    "this is exactly the reason why a phase instability can not occur in the sm model , but can appear in the cd2 one .    as a general remark , one should notice that for a coefficient ( or one of its complex parts ) to be exactly zero , an underlying profound physical selection process must exist ( e.g. , a symmetry of the problem or the existence of a conservation law ) . in general , coefficients should possess both components : their values will determine whether the corresponding process is sizeable or neglibible ( here the phase instability , elsewhere , e.g. , the dependence of the laser frequency on the electric field strength  @xcite ) .    up until here",
    "we have discussed the analytical comparison between the two models using the restriction , for the sm one , to a single direction of propagation .",
    "this assumption bears no weight on our conclusions , since the two counterpropagating waves are coupled through amplitude and not phase terms . thus , considering the full bidirectional nature of the sm model does not change the results of this analysis .",

    "the full mathematical description that our model provides , based on a complete codimension 2 expansion , offers the advantage of a proper and global handling of the various physical processes ( fwm , cs , ss ) in the neighbourhood of threshold , without ressorting to _ ad hoc _ choices to introduce a physical coupling mechanism .",
    "the _ ab initio _ derivation of the equations , avoiding all the usual approximations  as already done  @xcite  , has allowed us to discover the existence of a phase - instability which arises through a _ new fundamental parameter _ , named @xmath47-parameter , which in conjunction with the traditional @xmath4-parameter of semiconductor lasers , controls the growth of the phase - eigenvalue and maps the semiconductor laser problem into the benjamin - feir instability  @xcite of fluid dynamics : a problem whose parameter space has been carefully explored and characterized  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the @xmath47-parameter and its joint - control , with @xmath4 , of the instability is the probable reason why semiconductor lasers as different as mqws and qdls may present similar dynamics .",
