    "most of what we can learn about stars comes from observations of their outermost surface layers .",
    "we are left to infer the properties of the interior based on our best current understanding of the constitutive physics . the exception to",
    "this general rule arises from observations of pulsating stars , where seismic waves probe deep through the interior and bring information to the surface in the form of light and radial velocity variations .",
    "the most dramatic example is the sun , where such observations have led to the identification of millions of unique pulsation modes , each sampling the solar interior in a slightly different and complementary way .",
    "the radial profile of the sound speed inferred from inversion of these data led to such precise constraints on the standard solar model that , before the recent controversy over heavy element abundances @xcite , the observations and theory agreed to better than a few parts per thousand over 90% of the solar radius @xcite .",
    "although such detailed inversions are not currently possible for other stars , pulsation data do allow us to determine the global properties and to probe the gross internal composition and structure , providing valuable independent tests of stellar evolution theory .",
    "the reason for this qualitative difference is simple : if we could move the sun to the distance of the nearest star , many of the pulsation modes would no longer be detectable . without spatial resolution",
    ", only those modes with the lowest spherical degree ( @xmath0 ) would produce significant variations in the total integrated light or the spectral line profiles .",
    "these are also the modes that probe deepest into the stellar interior , collectively sampling the physical conditions from the core to the photosphere .",
    "the solar oscillations are excited by the acoustic noise generated by the near - surface convection , with nearly sonic speed .",
    "thus we expect to find similar oscillations in all stars with vigorous outer convection zones .",
    "a first unambiguous detection of solar - like oscillations in another star was in fact made by @xcite .",
    "recent improvements in our ability to make high - precision radial velocity measurements from the ground have been driven largely by efforts to detect extra - solar planets .",
    "this has led to the detection of solar - like oscillations in more than a dozen main - sequence and subgiant stars ; in addition , large - scale ground - based photometric campaigns have shown evidence for solar - like oscillations in numerous giants ( for a recent review see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the oscillation amplitudes and the frequency of maximum power in these stars agree reasonably well with our theoretical expectations  but in some cases the mode lifetimes appear to be significantly shorter than expected @xcite , suggesting that our knowledge of the convective driving and damping physics is incomplete .",
    "scintillation in the earth s atmosphere severely limits our ability to detect the parts - per - million light variations due to these pulsations in main - sequence stars .",
    "however , space - based photometric programs designed to detect extra - solar planet transits also have the sensitivity to document the stellar pulsation signals .",
    "thus , the french - led corot mission @xcite is providing extensive data of very high quality on oscillations in a broad range of stars .",
    "the field is progressing very rapidly and many new observations will become available in the next few years , particularly after the launch of nasa s kepler mission in 2009 . with this in mind",
    ", it will be a distinct advantage to have in place the computational methods that will allow us to maximize the science return of these data .",
    "this will lead us quickly to a deeper understanding of the solar oscillations in the context of similar pulsations in other stars , and will yield unprecedented constraints on the formation and evolution of stellar and planetary systems .",
    "the likely excitation mechanism by turbulent convection near the surface creates a broad envelope of power with a peak that scales with the acoustic cutoff frequency ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within this envelope a large fraction of the predicted low - degree pulsation modes",
    "are excited to detectable amplitudes , leading to readily identifiable patterns of peaks in the power spectrum characterized by the _ large separation _ ( @xmath1 ) , and the _ small separation _ ( @xmath2 ) , where @xmath3 is the radial order and @xmath4 is the spherical degree of the modes with oscillation frequency @xmath5 . without any detailed",
    "modeling , these overall patterns immediately lead to an estimate of the mean density of the star and can indicate the presence of interior chemical gradients that are a good proxy for the stellar age .",
    "but a full analysis must include a detailed comparison of the individual frequencies with theoretical models .",
    "one complication with such a comparison is the existence of so - called _ surface effects _ , which appear as systematic differences between the observed and calculated oscillation frequencies that grow larger towards the acoustic cutoff frequency .",
    "surface effects arise primarily due to incomplete modeling of the near - surface layers of the star where convection plays a major role @xcite .",
    "addressing this inherent deficiency in our 1d models would require ( among other things ) that we substitute the results of extensive 3d calculations for the parameterized mixing - length treatment of convection that is currently used in nearly all stellar evolution codes .",
    "alternately , we can make an empirical correction to the calculated frequencies following @xcite , who recently devised a method for calibrating the functional form of surface effects using solar data , and then obtaining corrections for other stars based on the frequencies of a reference model , scaled to correct for the different mean density ( see appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "we have developed an objective and automated method of fitting stellar models to the asteroseismic data soon expected to emerge from nasa s kepler mission .",
    "this will lead to reliable determinations of stellar radii to help characterize the extra - solar planetary systems discovered by the mission , and stellar ages to reveal how such systems evolve over time . for the asteroseismic targets that do not contain planetary companions it will allow a uniform determination of fundamental physical properties for hundreds of solar - type stars , providing a new window on stellar structure and evolution . in ",
    "[ sec2 ] we provide an overview of the stellar models as well as the optimization and analysis techniques that establish the foundation of our fitting method .",
    "we describe our initial numerical experiments to calibrate the method with sun - as - a - star data in ",
    "[ sec3 ] , and we outline our plans for further validation in  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the kepler mission will soon yield precise high - cadence time - series photometry of hundreds of pulsating stars every few months for at least 3.5 years @xcite . we will then face the challenge of determining the fundamental properties of these stars from the data , by attempting to match them with the output of computer models . the traditional approach to this task",
    "is to make informed guesses for each of the model parameters , and then to adjust them iteratively until an adequate match is found .",
    "the volume of asteroseismic data that will emerge from the kepler mission calls for a more automated approach to modeling that initially explores a broad range of model parameters in an objective manner .",
    "the cornerstone of our model - fitting approach is a global optimization method using a parallel genetic algorithm .",
    "the result of the global search provides the starting point for a local analysis using a levenberg - marquardt algorithm with singular value decomposition , which also allows us to explore the information content of the observables and the impact of including additional observational constraints @xcite .",
    "we have recently adapted the aarhus stellar evolution code ( astec ; * ? ? ? * ) and adiabatic pulsation code ( adipls ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to interface with the parallel genetic algorithm .",
    "these are essentially the same models that were developed for the analysis of helioseismic data , and are the source of model s of @xcite , which has been used extensively as a reference model for solar inversions . using these models for the analysis of pulsations in solar - type stars will provide some internal consistency in our understanding of solar - like oscillations .",
    "briefly , these stellar models use the opal 2005 equation of state ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the most recent opal opacities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supplemented by kurucz opacities at low temperatures .",
    "the nuclear reaction rates come from @xcite , convection is described by the mixing - length theory of @xcite , and we included the effects of helium settling as described by @xcite .",
    "each model evaluation involves the computation of a stellar evolution track from the zero - age main sequence through a mass - dependent number of internal time steps , terminating prior to the beginning of the red - giant stage . rather than calculate the pulsation frequencies for each of the 200300 models along the track , we exploit the fact that the average frequency spacing of consecutive radial overtones @xmath6 in most cases is a monotonically decreasing function of age @xcite .",
    "once the evolution track is complete , we start with a pulsation analysis of the model at the middle time step and then use a binary decision tree  comparing the observed and calculated values of @xmath6to select older or younger models along the track . in practice , this recipe allows us to interpolate the age between the two nearest time steps by running the pulsation code on just 8 models from each stellar evolution track .",
    "since we are interested in developing a general - purpose modeling tool for asteroseismic data from the kepler mission , we need to select a global method for optimizing the match between our model output and the available observations of any given star . using only observations and the constitutive physics of the model to restrict the range of possible values for each parameter , a genetic algorithm ( ga ;",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can provide a relatively efficient means of searching globally for the optimal model .",
    "although it is more difficult for a ga to find _ precise _ values for the optimal set of parameters efficiently , it is well suited to search for the _ region _ of parameter space that contains the global minimum . in this sense , the ga is an objective means of obtaining a good first guess for a more traditional local analysis method , which can narrow in on the precise values and uncertainties of the optimal model parameters .",
    "@xcite developed a fully parallel and distributed implementation of the pikaia genetic algorithm that was originally written by @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this modeling tool in the context of white dwarf asteroseismology , which ultimately led to a number of interesting physical results , including : ( 1 ) a precise estimate of the astrophysically important ( @xmath7c + @xmath8he @xmath9 @xmath10o ) nuclear reaction rate @xcite , ( 2 ) the first unambiguous detection of a crystallized core in a massive pulsating white dwarf @xcite , and ( 3 ) asteroseismic confirmation of a key prediction of diffusion theory in white dwarf envelopes @xcite .",
    "the impact of this method on the analysis of pulsating white dwarfs suggests that seismological modeling of other types of stars could also benefit from this approach .",
    "our implementation of the ga optimizes four adjustable model parameters ; these are the stellar mass ( @xmath11 ) from 0.75 to 1.75 @xmath12 , the metallicity ( @xmath13 ) from 0.002 to 0.05 ( equally spaced in @xmath14 ) , the initial helium mass fraction ( @xmath15 ) from 0.22 to 0.32 , and the mixing - length parameter ( @xmath16 ) from 1 to 3 . the stellar age ( @xmath17 ) is optimized internally during each model evaluation by matching the observed value of @xmath6 ( see  [ sec2.1 ] ) .",
    "the ga uses two - digit decimal encoding , so there are 100 possible values for each parameter within the ranges specified above .",
    "each run of the ga evolves a population of 128 models through 200 generations to find the optimal set of parameters , and we execute 4 independent runs with different random initialization to ensure that the best model identified is truly the global solution .",
    "this method requires about @xmath18 model evaluations , compared to @xmath19 models for a complete grid at the same sampling density , making the ga nearly 1000 times more efficient than a complete grid ( currently 1 week of computing time , compared to many years for a grid ) .",
    "of course , a grid could in principle be applied to hundreds of observational data sets without calculating additional models  but the ga approach also gives us the flexibility to improve the physical ingredients in the future , while the physics of a grid would be fixed .",
    "once the ga brings us close enough to the global solution , we can switch to a local optimization method .",
    "we implement a modified levenberg - marquardt ( lm ) algorithm that uses singular value decomposition ( svd ) on the calculated design matrices to filter the least important information from the observables ( some of which may be dominated by noise ) .",
    "this then provides an effective local inversion technique .",
    "lm is relatively fast and stable , and convergence typically occurs within 34 iterations .",
    "we treat the local analysis as a @xmath20-minimization problem , where one seeks to find the set of parameters * p * that minimizes @xmath21 here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the @xmath24 measurements and errors , while the @xmath25 are the calculated model observables resulting from * p*. the lm+svd method requires an initial guess of * p * , and these are taken to be the results from the global search by the ga .",
    "the lm+svd analysis subsequently uses derivative information from the model at the current parameter values to calculate suggested parameter changes @xmath26 that will bring the model observables closer to the observations .",
    "we have three main motivations for implementing a local optimization method at the end of the global search .",
    "first , the ga has a limited resolution for each parameter , and the values that match the observations best are most likely between the fixed sample points .",
    "for example , the parameter @xmath13 near solar values is tuned by the ga along sample points spaced 0.0006 apart , corresponding to a precision of roughly 3% . considering that the search resolution is limited for _ all _ of the model parameters",
    ", this significantly limits the precision of the global optimization .",
    "the resolution of the local analysis is limited only by the precision of the stellar evolution and pulsation codes , so we use it to adjust the models below the resolution of the ga search .",
    "our second motivation for the local analysis is to quantify the final parameter uncertainties and correlations , and to probe the information content of the observables .",
    "we do this by calculating the derivatives of the model observables with respect to each of the fitted parameters , and then dividing each vector by the corresponding measurement error .",
    "this matrix can be referred to simply as the design matrix * d*. we subsequently calculate the singular value decomposition of * d * for some of its very useful properties ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) .",
    "the final motivation for implementing a local analysis is to explore the effects of using different physical descriptions of the stellar interior @xcite .",
    "when the changes to the underlying physics are relatively subtle , we can assume that the global search by the ga using one set of assumptions will also provide a good starting point for a local analysis under slightly perturbed conditions . by applying the techniques explained in @xcite , such an analysis",
    "could demonstrate that the observational data contain enough information to distinguish clearly between different choices for the equation of state , for example .",
    "ultimately , this technique could reveal discrepancies in the observables that indicate which physical description is most suitable for the star under investigation .",
    "we apply the local analysis to each of the sets of optimal parameters identified by the four independent runs of the ga .",
    "the local analysis involves the gradual refinement of the optimal parameters through the iterative application of several steps :    1 .",
    "scan the @xmath13 parameter within @xmath270.002 of its original value , and perform a new minimization for each starting value of @xmath13 .",
    "we retain the set of parameters * p@xmath28 * that result in the lowest value of the reduced @xmath20 .",
    "2 .   starting with * p@xmath28 * , scan the @xmath15 parameter within @xmath270.01 of its initial value , and perform a new minimization for each starting value of @xmath15 .",
    "again we retain the * p@xmath28 * that yields the lowest reduced @xmath20 .",
    "3 .   rescan the @xmath13 parameter beginning with * p@xmath28*. we adopt as the optimal model the set of parameters that yield the lowest reduced @xmath20 from this final iteration .",
    "the reason for scanning @xmath15 and @xmath13 becomes clear when we begin to understand the intrinsic parameter correlations , which are enhanced by the limited set of observations ( see  [ sec3.2 ] ) .    in most cases the best model found by the global search leads to the final best model after the local optimization .",
    "however , sometimes a model that appears to be marginally worse at the end of the global search is improved more substantially during the local analysis .",
    "we take our final solution to be the best match from the four independent analyses , and for clarity we report the results of the corresponding global search even when it is not the best of the four models identified by the ga ( cf",
    ".   table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the final uncertainties in the parameter values ( @xmath29 ) and in the model observables ( @xmath30 ) are calculated using svd ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) .",
    "the overall goal of our model - fitting pipeline is to take a range of oscillation frequencies and other constraints as input , to identify and refine the model that best matches these observations , and to produce the optimal values of several parameters and other characteristics of the model as output . to ensure that our pipeline yields reliable results",
    ", we must begin by applying it to data where the basic stellar properties are already known .",
    "the most obvious choice is the sun , where high - quality sun - as - a - star observations are available from multiple experiments .",
    "if we feed the pipeline a stellar - like set of solar data , we can judge the experiment a success if the pipeline returns the known solar properties within acceptable tolerances . to reach this goal",
    ", we must first optimize the efficiency of the search method by passing synthetic data through the model - fitting procedure (  [ sec3.1 ] ) , calibrate the differences between our models and real observations due to near - surface effects and ensure that the resulting empirical correction does not introduce any large systematic errors in the final model parameters (  [ sec3.2 ] ) , and finally quantify any differences in the derived model parameters due to the source and error properties of the solar data (  [ sec3.3 ] ) .",
    "the results of these experiments are listed in table  [ tab1 ] , and described in the following subsections .",
    "we will eventually want to validate this model - fitting pipeline using other stars that differ from the sun , where the physical properties are known with lower precision .",
    "however , because of the computation - intensive nature of our method ( which currently requires about 1 week on 512 processors ) , we will consider here only the initial validation using solar data .",
    "although genetic algorithms are often more efficient than other comparably global optimization methods , they are still quite demanding computationally .",
    "fortunately , the procedure is inherently parallelizable ; we need to calculate many models , and each one of them is independent of the others .",
    "so the number of available processors determines the number of models that can be calculated in parallel .",
    "also , there is very little communication overhead ; parameter values are sent to each processor , and they return either a list of observables or just a goodness - of - fit measure if the predictions have already been compared to the observations .",
    "the parallel version of the pikaia genetic algorithm is perfectly general , and did not require any structural modifications to interface with our stellar evolution and pulsation codes .",
    "the efficiency of genetic - algorithm - based optimization can be defined as the number of model evaluations required to yield the global solution , relative to the number of models that would be required for a complete grid at the same sampling density . in practice , a ga is usually hundreds or even thousands of times more efficient than a complete grid , and its performance is fairly insensitive to the few internal parameters that control its operation .",
    "we initially set these internal parameters ( e.g.   population size , run length , crossover and mutation rates ) based on our experience with white dwarf models , but we also ran synthetic data through the optimization procedure in a series of `` hare & hound '' ( h&h ) exercises to ensure that the input parameters were recovered faithfully .    the basic procedure for an h&h exercise is for one team member to calculate the theoretical oscillation frequencies and other observables for a specific set of model parameters ( @xmath29 ) . a subset of the predictions , typical of whatever is available from actual observations , is then given to another team member who does not know the source parameters .",
    "the data are passed through the complete optimization method in an attempt to recover the source parameters without any additional information .",
    "the results of such exercises are used to quantify the success rate of the optimization method ( the fraction of independent runs that lead to the known source parameters ) , and to improve its efficiency ( minimize the number of model evaluations ) if possible .",
    "for our first h&h exercise ( with source parameters listed in the row labeled `` h&h1 '' in table  [ tab1 ] ) , we assume that typical asteroseismic data from the kepler mission will include twelve frequencies for each of the radial ( @xmath31 ) , dipole ( @xmath32 ) , and quadrupole ( @xmath33 ) modes , with consecutive radial orders in the range @xmath34 is necessary for the operation of our pipeline .",
    "information about the value of @xmath3 is only provided for completeness . ] .",
    "thus , we allowed the ga to fit a total of 36 oscillation frequencies .",
    "we assigned statistical uncertainties to each frequency by scaling up the errors on the corresponding modes in bison data @xcite by a factor of 10 , which is roughly what we expect from kepler data ( @xmath35hz ) .",
    "we complemented this synthetic asteroseismic information with artificial data on the effective temperature and luminosity , with errors comparable to what is expected for stars in the kepler input catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath36  k , @xmath37 ) .",
    "this is the simplest conceivable test of the pipeline ",
    "if we generate a set of model data and then use the optimization method to match those data using exactly the same models , how quickly will the ga find the true values of the model parameters ?",
    "the results of such a test verify the basic functionality of the algorithm , and tell us the approximate number of iterations ( or `` generations '' of the ga ) that we need to execute before stopping the search .",
    "of the best solution in the population as a function of generation number for four independent runs of the genetic algorithm on the h&h1 data set .",
    "all four runs converge to the global solution within 150 generations.[fig1 ] ]    the results of h&h1 for four independent runs of the ga are illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "each convergence curve shows the reduced @xmath20 ( hereafter @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of constraints and @xmath40 is the number of parameters ) for the best model in the ga population as a function of generation number .",
    "all of the runs converge in less than @xmath41150 generations , in each case leading to the same mass as the source model and values for the other parameters offset by less than @xmath411% from the source values ( the best model from the ga is listed in the row labeled `` global '' under h&h1 in table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "since we expect the algorithm to converge more quickly in this highly idealized case , we decided to continue running the ga for 200 generations for the more difficult tests that follow .",
    "the local analysis using lm+svd brings the final value of the metallicity ( @xmath13 ) closer to the source model , while retaining comparable accuracy for the other parameters ( see the row labeled `` local '' under h&h1 in table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "note that the unusually small values of @xmath42 in table  [ tab1 ] are a consequence of adopting scaled - up bison errors for the model frequencies , which vastly overestimate the true theoretical uncertainties in this case .",
    "the biggest challenge to comparing the oscillation frequencies from theoretical models with those actually observed in solar - type stars are the systematic errors due to _",
    "surface effects_. the mixing - length parameterization of convection that is used in most stellar models is insufficient to describe the near - surface layers , and this leads to a systematic difference of several @xmath43hz ( up to about 0.3% for a solar model ) between the observed and calculated frequencies ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the offset is nearly independent of the spherical degree ( @xmath4 ) of the mode and grows larger towards the acoustic cutoff frequency .",
    "the 3d simulations of convection that might in principle reduce this discrepancy for individual stars are far too computationally expensive for the model - fitting approach that we are developing .",
    "instead , we adopt the method for empirical correction of surface effects described by @xcite , which uses the discrepancies between model s and golf data for the sun @xcite to calibrate the empirical surface correction .",
    "the models that we have adopted for the pipeline include a slightly different set of physical ingredients than what was used to produce model s from @xcite .",
    "to characterize the surface effects , we need a model that uses the same physics as the other models in the present investigation , while matching the model s frequencies as closely as possible . to find such a model ( hereafter model ) , we used our pipeline to fit the computed frequencies of model s. since this involves the comparison of two sets of model frequencies  both of which include a mixing - length parameterization of convection  there are no surface effects to consider .",
    "again we allowed the ga to fit 36 frequencies for modes with @xmath34 and @xmath44 and we used the same scaled bison errors and the same constraints on the effective temperature and luminosity ( see  [ sec3.1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting optimal models from the global search and the local analysis had the parameter values listed in the rows below `` model  '' in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "following @xcite , we fit a power law to the differences between the frequencies of the radial modes of this model and the corresponding frequencies from bison data to characterize the surface effects ( see figure  [ fig2 ] and appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "we found a power law exponent @xmath45 , slightly lower than the value ( @xmath46 ) derived by @xcite using data from the golf experiment . with",
    "this exponent fixed , the recipe of @xcite describes how to predict the surface effect for any other set of calculated oscillation data , allowing us to apply this empirical correction to each of our models before comparing them to observations .    ]",
    "if our strategy of making this empirical correction to each of our models is to succeed , it must not only work _",
    "well _ for models in a certain region of the search space ",
    "it must work _ best _ for the model that simultaneously matches all of the independent observational constraints within their uncertainties .",
    "our second h&h exercise ( with parameters listed in the row labeled `` h&h2 '' in table  [ tab1 ] ) was designed to test the behavior of the pipeline with the surface correction included .",
    "the source model and other constraints were identical to those used for h&h1 , but the surface effect was first calculated from eq.([eq.fobs - fref ] ) and then applied to each model frequency prior to fitting so that the h&h2 data would mimic real observations .",
    "we fixed the value of @xmath47 to 4.82 ( as determined above ) and we calculated the value of @xmath48 using eq.([eq.fobs - fref ] ) with the scaling factor @xmath49 determined using bison data as the reference set of observations .",
    "the fitting procedure then included the empirical surface correction  attempting to remove the systematic frequency errors that we artificially introduced  as detailed in appendix  [ appa ] . again",
    "this test reveals how long we must run the ga for it to converge to the global solution , but it also quantifies any systematic errors on the derived parameter values that arise from our implementation of the empirical surface correction .",
    "as expected , the ga converges to the global solution more slowly with the inclusion of the surface correction . within 150200 generations",
    ", two of the four runs converged to the parameters listed in the row labeled `` global '' under h&h2 in table  [ tab1 ] , while the other two remained in a nearby local minimum . if we had continued the search , these two runs would eventually also have found the global solution .",
    "the largest systematic error appears in the value of @xmath13 , which is about 6% ( two sample points ) higher in the global solution than in the source model .",
    "there are also smaller errors ( @xmath411% ) on the derived values of @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "the results of the local analysis ( listed in the row labeled `` local '' under h&h2 in table  [ tab1 ] ) bring both @xmath13 and @xmath17 closer to the source values while preserving the accuracy of the other parameters .",
    "the remaining errors are not a deficiency in the ability of the method to find the true solution  the identified model actually results in a lower @xmath42 than the source parameters .",
    "the reason for this counter - intuitive result is that we can only generate a surface correction when there is a reference set of observed oscillation frequencies ( see appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "our source model used the bison data for reference , and these data have a slightly different value of the large frequency separation ( @xmath50hz ) than the resulting source model ( @xmath51hz ) .",
    "since this quantity is used by the binary decision tree to fit the age of the model , the small difference leads to a slightly offset derived age  which subsequently modifies the optimal composition through intrinsic parameter correlations .",
    "in other words , when generating a model with the surface correction included from a given set of parameters , those same parameters will generally not provide the best fit to the resulting observables .",
    "this actually highlights our inability to generate realistic data with surface effects , rather than an inherent limitation in our fitting method . in any case",
    ", this exercise demonstrates that the systematic errors resulting from our surface correction are small , and that running the ga for 200 generations should be sufficient for real observations .",
    "ultimately , our model - fitting pipeline can only be judged a success if it leads to accurate estimates of the stellar properties for the star that we know best : the sun .",
    "up to this point , we have essentially been fitting models to synthetic data  using the solar data from bison only to calibrate the empirical surface correction and to provide realistic errors .",
    "there are many other ingredients in our models that could in principle be insufficient descriptions of the actual conditions inside of real stars ",
    "deficiencies that could easily lead to systematic errors in our determinations of the optimal model parameters for a given set of oscillation data . for example , we initially tried to use models that employed the simpler eff equation of state @xcite for computational expediency , but this led to estimates of the stellar mass about 10% too high for the sun , and unacceptably large systematic errors on many of the other stellar properties . even attempting to ignore the effects of helium settling proved to be too coarse an approximation , leading to 5% errors on the mass .",
    "the only potential ingredient that we omitted without serious consequences was heavy element settling .",
    "this is not to say that simpler stellar models can not be used in the analysis of asteroseismic data , but rather that some of the more sophisticated ingredients are required to obtain accurate results from a _",
    "global _ search of the parameter space .    having demonstrated the effectiveness of the method by fitting our models to synthetic data , and after calibrating the empirical surface correction using the differences between model and the bison data , we finally applied our model - fitting pipeline to solar data from the bison and golf experiments .",
    "the oscillation frequencies from these two sources are identical to each other within the observational uncertainties , but their noise properties are slightly different  allowing us to quantify any systematic errors that might arise from subtle effects in the data acquisition and analysis methods . in both cases",
    "we used the same set of modes referenced in the earlier experiments ( @xmath34 , @xmath44 ) with the respective errors again scaled up by a factor of 10 , and the same constraints on the effective temperature and luminosity ( see  [ sec3.1 ] ) .",
    "the two sets of input data differed only in the absolute values of the oscillation frequencies ( yielding distinct values of @xmath6 for fitting the stellar age ) , and in the statistical uncertainties assigned to each mode ( leading to subtle differences in the weighting of the fit ) .",
    "in general , the four independent runs of the ga for each data set led to slightly different results after 200 generations , so we list only the solution leading to the best model in the rows below `` bison '' and `` golf '' in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "with the successful validation of our model - fitting pipeline using solar data , we now need to ensure that our adopted treatment of surface effects yields reasonable optimal models when applied to other stellar data . while numerous ground - based and space - based data sets on other stars are already available , the computation - intensive nature of our method necessarily limits the present investigation to the single case of the sun .",
    "the obvious next step is to use archival ground - based data on several well studied solar - type stars to validate the pipeline for various stellar masses ( e.g. @xmath16 cen a & b , near @xmath411.1 and @xmath410.9 @xmath12 respectively ) and for different evolutionary stages ( e.g. the `` future sun '' @xmath54  hyi , at @xmath417  gyr ) .",

    "this is expected for evolved stars like @xmath54  hyi because as they expand and cool the p - mode frequencies decrease , while the g - mode frequencies increase as the star becomes more centrally condensed .",
    "this leads to a range of frequencies where these modes can overlap and exchange their character , manifested as so - called _",
    "avoided crossings_. this behavior changes very quickly with stellar age , and propagates from one mode to the next as a star continues to evolve .",

    "in addition , accurate rotation rates and ages will provide clues about the formation and evolution of the planet - hosting systems .",

    "in the solar case , this model is defined by the inversion of the frequencies over a broad range of available modes . here the difference between the observed and best model frequencies is found to be well fitted by a power law , which has the convenient property of being free of a frequency scale : @xmath58 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , where @xmath59 is a suitably chosen reference frequency , and @xmath48 and @xmath47 are parameters to be determined .    in practice",

    "@xcite repeated a similar analysis for different numbers of modes ( all values from 7 to 13 ) , and found the derived value of @xmath47 to range from 4.4 to 5.25 .",
    "clearly , the frequency differences do not exactly follow a power law , and so the exponent in the power - law fit depends substantially on the frequency range . however , the value for @xmath48 varied by less than 0.1@xmath43hz in all cases . if we repeat our analysis using golf data @xcite for the same set of modes , we derive a value of @xmath67",
    ". both of our values are comparable to the value @xmath46 derived by @xcite .",
    "after calibrating the value of the exponent @xmath47 using solar data , the prescription of @xcite describes how to predict the surface effect for any other stellar model being compared to real observations .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is determined by applying eq.([eq.r ] ) to each trial model through a comparison of the calculated frequencies with the observations .",
    "the value of @xmath48 is then determined using equations ( [ eq.fobs-fref ] ) and ( [ eq.fbest.fref ] ) , and subsequently used in conjunction with @xmath47 to predict the surface effect for each frequency of the model . this recipe is applied to every model calculated during the global search by the ga , and during the local analysis using lm+svd .",
    "effectively we are adjusting the predicted surface effect for each model based on the difference between the mean densities implied by the two sets of frequencies .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of the surface effect reduces the weight of the mode in the final fit , giving more weight to low frequencies but still attempting to optimize the match at high frequencies .",
    "the final weight for each mode is determined by the quadratic sum of the ( statistical ) observational error and half the ( systematic ) surface correction .",
    "as discussed in detail by @xcite , the analysis of the linearized relation between observables and parameters is conveniently carried out in terms of singular value decomposition ( svd ) because it has some very useful properties when applied to a matrix .",
    "suppose we have a _ model _ that when given a set of input parameters * p * ( we normally do not know * p * and we wish to retrieve them ) produces an output set of expected model observables .",
    "generally the model- ( or parameter- ) fitting problem consists of matching a set of observations * o * to the output model observables , by making parameter changes @xmath26 to * p * , until we find the model that fits the observations best .",
    "once we find * p * , to exploit svd we calculate the partial derivatives of each of the observables with respect to each of the model parameters * p * , and subsequently divide by the measurement errors .",
    "the result is what we call the design matrix * d*.    the svd of * d * (= * uwv@xmath68 * ) neatly describes the relationship between the model observables and the stellar parameters through a set of linear transformation vectors . here",
    "the matrices * u * and * v * are of order @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively , where @xmath39 is the number of observables and @xmath40 is the number of parameters ; * w * is a diagonal matrix of order @xmath70 , with diagonal elements consisting of the singular values @xmath71 .",
    "* u * and * v * consist of orthonormal vectors that span the observable and parameter spaces respectively , while the diagonal elements of * w * assign a relative importance to each vector . each column vector of * u * describes the content of each observable , the singular value @xmath71 quantifies the importance of this vector ( i.e. , it organizes the observables by amount and type of information ) , while each column vector of * v * describes how the information from each observable vector is distributed among the parameters ( i.e. , which observables are important for constraining certain parameters ) .",
    "we will see this more clearly below .",
    "if the models were linear then the solution @xmath26 , in a least - squares sense , could be found simply from the discrepancies @xmath26 between the observations and the model observables , normalized by the errors . in terms of svd",
    ", the result can be written as @xmath26 = * vw@xmath72u@xmath68 * @xmath26 , which shows clearly that the parameter changes required to reconcile * p * with the observables comes from a product of ( 1 ) the discrepancies between the observations and the observables , and ( 2 ) a set of linear transformation vectors that are scaled by the inverse of the singular values .",
    "below we will explore how we can use svd to illucidate both the information contained in the set of observables and the available constraints on the parameters .     and",

    "if we scale the rows in @xmath73 by the inverse of the singular values we obtain the parameter correlations , which describe how to define the 5-dimensional error boundary.[fig4],width=528 ]    figure [ fig4 ] illustrates part of the orthonormal matrix * u * ( left ) and the full orthonormal matrix * v*. because we have @xmath75 parameters in the problem , each of the matrices consists of 5 _ column vectors _ ; thus we plot @xmath74 and @xmath73 , ordered such that the horizontal vectors corresponding to the largest singular values @xmath71 are at the top .",
    "each column vector of * u * has @xmath76 elements , which is the number of observations that are used to determine the solution , but we only include the first 5 elements for illustration .",
    "the elements of the matrix can only take values between @xmath77 and + 1 , and each number is represented by a triangle whose size and direction are proportional to the magnitude and sign of each element .",
    "the column vectors are labeled 15 : 1 represents the first column vector , which is associated with the largest singular value , 2 is the second largest singular value , while 5 is the smallest .",
    "thus , the vectors are effectively _ ranked _ according to their information content , where the least important information is given in the vectors corresponding to the smallest @xmath71 .",
    "for example , if we were to perform the matrix multiplication of * uwv@xmath68 * using only the top vectors , we would be able to recover most of the input matrix * d*. essentially this is equivalent to zeroing the values of * w * that are below a certain threshold before doing the multiplication . clearly the observables that appear among the top vectors are most important for constraining the parameter solution , while the parameters that appear among the top vectors are the most constrained .",
    "inspecting the left panel of figure  [ fig4 ] , by scanning down the fourth column we see that the observable @xmath78 has components mainly in the second and fourth vectors .",
    "the luminosity @xmath79 is present in vectors 24 , while the individual frequencies are present mostly in vectors 1 and 2 .",
    "the most important information comes from the first vector , and we can see clearly that in this case the seismic information dominates .",
    "we also see that @xmath79 and @xmath78 usually appear in the same vectors , implying that these observables work together to constrain the parameter solution .",
    "the right panel shows how the information from the observables is distributed among the parameters .",
    "the top vector has mainly one large component , @xmath13 .",
    "this implies that @xmath13 is most constrained by the set of observables , and in particular by the observables that appear in the top row of the @xmath74 matrix , i.e. the frequencies .",
    "similarly , the mixing - length parameter ( @xmath16 ) appears predominantly in the fourth vector , and is constrained mainly by @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "returning to the linear parameter - fitting problem , we saw that calculating @xmath26 depended strongly on the size of the singular value associated with the transformation vectors ( as well as the discrepancies ) . because @xmath13 appears in the first vector and the inverse of the first singular value",
    "is the smallest , this means that @xmath13 is not allowed to deviate much from its initial value .",
    "so if we find that we are in a local minimum that is not the global solution , it is unlikely that we will find a better solution that deviates much in @xmath13 .",
    "for this reason we choose to explore a range of @xmath13 values during the local analysis .",
    "the vectors * v*@xmath80 are the basis vectors , and describe the normalized changes that we can make to each of the parameters while respecting the constraints imposed by the observables .",
    "the inverse of the @xmath71 describe the magnitude of each of the vectors that keeps the parameters within 1@xmath81 of the final answer .",
    "since the vectors corresponding to larger @xmath82 have smaller @xmath71 ( larger inverses ) , the parameters associated with these vectors will extend further into the parameter space , i.e. they are less constrained by the observations .     and",
    "@xmath15 , as described by svd , for the final fit model to the bison data .",
    "the arrows are the 2-element directional vectors given by the projections of @xmath83 and @xmath84 which dominate the determination of @xmath11 and @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , and the ellipse is defined by these vectors.[fig5],width=336 ]    inspecting the matrix @xmath73 in figure [ fig4 ] , note that vector 2 reveals both @xmath11 and @xmath15 to be positive , indicating that they should be increased or decreased together to satisfy the constraints imposed by the observables .",
    "however , vector 3 implies that if @xmath11 increases , @xmath15 should decrease . when both of these vectors are projected onto the @xmath11-@xmath15 plane and scaled according to 1/@xmath85 and 1/@xmath86 , vector 3",
    "is the longer of the two .",
    "these scaled vectors are shown as arrows in figure  [ fig5 ] , defining the semi - major and minor axes of the projected 1@xmath81 error ellipse .",
    "the error ellipse defines the boundary of the allowed parameter values that will change the @xmath20 value by less than @xmath87 , where @xmath87 is the value that defines the 1@xmath81 error for the relevant number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this figure shows clearly that there is a very strong inverse correlation between these parameters , and hints at the size of the uncertainty in each one or @xmath15 tends to increase the luminosity , so if one of these parameters is increased the other must be decreased to satisfy the luminosity contraint while continuing to match the other observables . ] .",
    "though not as clearly visible in figure [ fig4 ] , @xmath13 and @xmath15 have a strong direct correlation , so for the local analysis we explore a range of @xmath15 as well as @xmath13 .    finally , the _ covariance matrix _ can be expressed in a very compact form using svd ; the covariance between parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 is : @xmath90 in particular , the formal uncertainties @xmath91 on each of the parameters are obtained from @xmath92 . given this very clear form for describing the correlations between the parameters and their uncertainties , we can also determine the uncertainties on the model observables ( such as @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) or some other properties ( such as the core hydrogen content ) by calculating the models at the boundaries of the error ellipse .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : covariance ] ) can also be used to investigate _ how _ to reduce the uncertainties in each of the parameters  with what precision do we need to measure the individual observables ? what other information may be useful to help break the degeneracies between some parameters ? and are there limits to what we can learn from the available data ?"
