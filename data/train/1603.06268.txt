    "we consider that the only tide driving orbital evolution is the stellar tide ( meaning that the planet is synchronized with zero obliquity ) . on the other hand , instead of taking into account the full frequency - dependence of tidal dissipation ,",
    "we choose to adopt the frequency - averaged approach first introduced by @xcite and applied to low - mass stars by @xcite .",

    "<S> since twenty years , a large population of close - in planets orbiting various classes of low - mass stars ( from m - type to a - type stars ) has been discovered . in such systems , </S>",
    "<S> the dissipation of the kinetic energy of tidal flows in the host star may modify its rotational evolution and shape the orbital architecture of the surrounding planetary system . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , recent observational and theoretical works demonstrated that the amplitude of this dissipation can vary over several orders of magnitude as a function of stellar mass , age and rotation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , stellar spin - up occurring during the pre - main - sequence ( pms ) phase because of the contraction of stars and their spin - down because of the torque applied by magnetized stellar winds strongly impact angular momentum exchanges within star - planet systems . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is now necessary to take into account the structural and rotational evolution of stars when studying the orbital evolution of close - in planets . at the same time , the presence of planets may modify the rotational dynamics of the host stars and as a consequence their evolution , magnetic activity and mixing . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we present the first study of the dynamics of close - in planets of various masses orbiting low - mass stars ( from @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) where we compute the simultaneous evolution of the star s structure , rotation and tidal dissipation in its external convective enveloppe . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that tidal friction due to the stellar dynamical tide , i.e. tidal inertial waves excited in the convection zone , can be larger by several orders of magnitude than the one of the equilibrium tide currently used in celestial mechanics , especially during the pms phase . moreover , because of this stronger tidal friction in the star , the orbital migration of the planet is now more pronounced and depends more on the stellar mass , rotation and age . </S>",
    "<S> this would very weakly affect the planets in the habitable zone because they are located at orbital distances such that stellar tide - induced migration happens on very long timescales . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the rotational evolution of host stars is only weakly affected by the presence of planets except for massive companions . </S>"
