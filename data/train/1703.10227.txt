    "this could produce dual active galactic nuclei ( agn ) on kiloparsec - scales that can be spatially separated and identified by , for example , their radio , optical or x - ray emission .",
    "the demographics of dual agn are critical for understanding the bh growth and agn activation induced by galaxy mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "extensive vlbi monitoring of 3c207 underpins a model wherein jet components are ejected at different angles around a cone , with the flow then recollimating downstream to align with the kiloparsec - scale emission @xcite . as noted above , a natural way to develop an inner cone",

    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that xrgs with distortions near the inner ends of the on - axis lobes and those having inversion - symmetric structures may likely be formed due to back - flow deflections by the thermal halos of the host ellipticals or due to swings / flips of the jet axis during a galaxy merger event .",
    "they also suggest that the xrgs having distortions near the outer ends of the on - axis lobes are indicative of axis precession , which may be caused by bbhs .",

    "we tentatively identify the former component as the vlba `` core '' from which the latter was ejected . the vla follow - up spectrum between 416 ghz ( in the observer frame ; figure  [ fig : spec ] ) matches that from the convolved vlba images , suggesting that the majority of the vla point - like emission originates on the parsec scales probed by the vlba .",
    "the rare twist between the lobes of psoj334 + 01 on parsec- and kiloparsec - scales may indicate that the quasar is ejecting jet components over an inner cone that traces a precessing jet in a bbh system .",

    "<S> supermassive binary black holes ( bbhs ) on sub - parsec scales are prime targets for gravitational wave experiments . </S>",
    "<S> they also provide insights on close binary evolution and hierarchical structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> sub - parsec bbhs can not be spatially resolved but indirect methods can identify candidates . in 2015 liu et al .  reported an optical - continuum periodicity in the quasar psoj334.2028 + 01.4075 , with the estimated mass and rest - frame period suggesting an orbital separation of about 0.006 pc ( 0.7 @xmath0arcsec ) . </S>",
    "<S> the persistence of the quasar s optical periodicity has recently been disfavored over an extended baseline . </S>",
    "<S> however , if a radio jet is launched from a sub - parsec bbh , the binary s properties can influence the radio structure on larger scales . here , we use the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and karl g.  jansky very large array ( vla ) to study the parsec- and kiloparsec - scale emission energized by the quasar s putative bbh . </S>",
    "<S> we find two vlba components separated by 3.6 mas ( 30 pc ) , tentatively identifying one as the vlba `` core '' from which the other was ejected . </S>",
    "<S> the vlba components contribute to a point - like , time - variable vla source that is straddled by lobes spanning 8 arcsec ( 66 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we classify psoj334.2028 + 01.4075 as a lobe - dominated quasar , albeit with an atypically large twist of @xmath1 between its elongation position angles on parsec- and kiloparsec - scales . by analogy with 3c207 , a well - studied lobe - dominated quasar with a similarly - rare twist </S>",
    "<S> , we speculate that psoj334.2028 + 01.4075 could be ejecting jet components over an inner cone that traces a precessing jet in a bbh system .    </S>",
