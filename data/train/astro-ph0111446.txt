    "@xmath0-doradus stars are rapidly rotating variables for which the second - order perturbative theory of ledoux ( 1951 ) fails to reproduce observations .",
    "indeed , oscillations and rotation periods are both around one day ( handler & krisciunas 1997 ) and eigenfrequencies should be non - perturbatively computed .    in this paper , gravito - inertial modes of a typical @xmath0-dor star are computed using the anelastic approximation .",
    "we first compare the anelastic and subseismic approximations and show that the anelastic one is the best to filter out acoustic waves from the infinite system of differential equations (  2 ) .",
    "properties of gravito - inertial oscillations are then recalled (  3 ) and the part played by the characteristics trajectories is enlightened , before conclusions in  4 .",
    "these two approximations have been compared in dintrans & rieutord ( 2001 ) .",
    "both approximations neglect perturbations in the gravitational potential and assume that the eulerian pressure fluctuations do not contribute to lagrangian ones . on the contrary , they differ on the form of the equation of mass conservation as    @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively denote the equilibrium density , gravity and square of the velocity of sound whereas @xmath5 is the velocity .",
    "comparisons have been made using g - modes of the homogeneous and @xmath6 polytropes .",
    "analytic expressions for the anelastic and subseismic eigenfrequencies have been found for the homogeneous model whereas all the eigenfrequencies have been computed numerically for the @xmath6 polytrope .",
    "results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "they show that the anelastic values are between 5 and 20 times more accurate than the corresponding subseismic ones demonstrating that the anelastic approximation is best to filter out acoustic waves when studying low - frequency stellar oscillations .",

    "one obtains a generalized eigenvalue problem which is solved using either the qz algorithm ( all of eigenvalues @xmath17 are computed ) or an iterative arnoldi - chebyshev solver ( only desired eigenvalues @xmath18 are computed , with their associated eigenvectors @xmath19 ) .",
    "the perturbative theory has been tested by following a high - order g - mode ( period@xmath200.3d ) of a typical 1.5 m@xmath21 @xmath0-dor star as rotation was increased . as expected for this kind of long - period mode",
    ", perturbative theories rapidly reach their limits since first- and second - order relative errors are comparable to the observational detection limit for rotation periods of about 8 and 3 days , respectively .",
    "= 0.5 = 0.5    then , by solving the non - perturbative problem ( [ eigenv ] ) in the rapid rotation rgime ( rotation down to one day ) , we found the more and more important part played by the characteristics trajectories as the rotation increases .",

    "we showed that a non - perturbative approach is necessary for rotation periods below 3 days .",
    "then , a computation of eigenmodes allowed us to reach the one - day rotation rgime where we found that modes part into regular and singular ones as the associated characteristic trajectories are ergodic or focused along an attractor .",
