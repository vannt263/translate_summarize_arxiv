    "from the derivation of our model it is evident the connection with `` ball in the box '' problems @xcite . in our approach the `` boxes '' map to the degree of the nodes and the `` balls '' map to the edges of the graph .",
    "this makes a crucial difference respect with the models @xcite , in which the `` boxes '' map to the nodes of the graph .",
    "the model , as well as a urn model can be simulated using a heat - bath rule @xcite which then suggest the following algorithm : +   + -algorithm i- +    * choose randomly a `` ball '' randomly , i.e. choose a link @xmath124 ; * choose a `` box '' randomly , i.e. chose a node @xmath125 with a random value of its degree @xmath126 .",
    "this choice is implemented by choosing a node @xmath125 with probability proportional to @xmath127 .",
    "* swap link @xmath124 with link @xmath128 with the heat bath rule algorithm , i.e. with probability @xmath129    from the shape of the linking probability @xmath109 we infer that this algorithm , include some sort of inverse preferential attachment since rewiring to nodes with lower degree are more frequents . in figure",
    "@xmath130 we report the resulting degree distributions as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting distribution differ from the theoretical prediction for the presence of sharp lower cutoff .",
    "nevertheless the distribution for large @xmath7 decays with power - law exponents close to the expectation ( see inset figure [ montecarlo.fig ] ) with the difference depending on finite size effects .",
    "we checked that the upper cutoff @xmath25 scale with the network size as @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "for the case @xmath37 the algorithm follow a rule similar to the one used in the case @xmath36 with the further introduction of the ad hoc upper cutoff @xmath25 which is needed for the stability of the algorithm .",
    "consequently the algorithm is as following : +   + -algorithm ii- +    * choose randomly a link @xmath124 ; * choose node @xmath125 with a random value of its degree @xmath126 , i.e. choose a node @xmath125 with probability proportional to @xmath127 . *",
    "swap link @xmath124 with link @xmath128 only if @xmath133 and in this case with probability @xmath109    with = .",
    "the results of the simulations following algorithm ii are reported in fig . @xmath134 .",
    "the algorithm requires a very long equilibration time respect to the case with @xmath36 .",
    "consequently we consider relatively small networks sizes up to @xmath135 nodes . in the inset",
    "we report the value the best value of the power - law fit to data together with the theoretical expectations .    in conclusion ,",
    "the statistical mechanics treatment of complex networks shown in this paper is able to put in a similar context , but in opposite limits , the emergence of scale - free networks and finite - scale networks .",
    "scale - free degree distribution correspond to higher energy states of the network respect to finite - scale networks .",
    "especially homogeneous random graphs obtained for @xmath116 have minimal energy .",
    "heterogenous scale - free networks correspond to higher energy states .",
    "we have shown that this implies that uncorrelated simple scale - free networks live in a space of allowed networks relatively small .",
    "we believe that correlations present in various complex networks describing many technological , biological and social systems can only further reduce this space .",
    "consequently the evolutionary rule by which this degree distribution is selected reveal a tendency of minimizing this space .",

    "<S> a major universal property of complex networks is their degree distribution @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact both scale - free networks @xmath1 @xcite with diverging second moment of the degree distribution @xmath2 and finite - scale networks with finite second moment @xmath2 are widely encountered in many real networks . </S>",
    "<S> these two general network distributions have very strong impact also on the dynamics defined on these graphs as it has been widely discussed in the literature @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> different statistical mechanics approaches have been used to characterize complex ( scale - free and finite - scale ) networks . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the attention has been first addressed to the out - of - equilibrium dynamics which by the means of preferential attachment @xcite generates scale - free degree distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamics is justified by direct measurements for example in the case of the the world - wide - web @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , different approaches have been taken to assess if the scale - free degree distribution has to be considered as the equilibrium distribution of some statistical mechanics problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we restrict ourself to uncorrelated networks we see that the approaches can be classified into three major classes : the ones which see the emergence of a scale - free network structure at the phase transition @xcite ; the ones which assume a sort of preferential attachment in the dynamics @xcite the ones which consider some hidden variables associated to each node of the network s@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> models in the first two classes have strong relations .    in particular in @xcite an energy of the type @xmath3 was considered . </S>",
    "<S> the montecarlo probability for a single move at @xmath4 involve a linear preferential attachment mechanism with nodes of higher degree attracting links with higher probability . as a function of the temperature of the graph the model has two phase transitions . at the boundary between a sparse phase and a connected phase at a critical temperature @xmath5 a scale - free network with exponent @xmath6 is found . in @xcite </S>",

    "<S> the networks of these ensemble map to a urn or `` ball in the box '' model @xcite in which the `` boxes '' map to the nodes , the `` balls '' map to the edges of the graph and the probability of having @xmath7 edges at node @xmath8 is given by @xmath9.the scale - free network ensemble is recovered in the case of trees or networks with finite number of cycles . </S>",

    "<S> in the following paper we will present a statistical mechanics treatment of complex networks in which we consider as thermodynamic quantities two terms having a precise graphical interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> the `` energy '' associated with the degree distribution will the logarithm of the number of allowed equivalent simple networks is possible to draw given a degree sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the `` entropy '' associated with a degree distribution will be the logarithm of the number of ways in which we can distribute @xmath17 edges among the @xmath18 nodes of the graph following the distribution @xmath19 . from this </S>",
    "<S> statistical mechanics approach we observe the emergence either of scale - free networks or finite - scale networks without been close to a phase transition in the network . </S>",
    "<S> the models is very closed related to the urn ( `` balls in the box '' ) models but with urn ( `` boxes '' ) mapping to the degree of the nodes and not to the nodes themselves . on the same time </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical rules which give rise to the network directly derives from the choice of the energy function we make . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of scale - free degree distribution in the opposite limit of some finite - scale degree distributions can be put in relation with the findings of ref . </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , here the network is not growing and the nodes are all equivalent since there is no fitness associated to the nodes . although the dynamics mechanism giving rise to these distributions do not appear to be related to real phenomena occurring in evolving networks ( as for example the preferential attachment mechanism ) this approach has the advantage to characterize uncorrelated scale - free networks and finite scale networks on the base of the multiplicity of simple graphs is it possible to draw given a degree distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in fact we obtain that scale - free degree distributions characterize networks in which the energy is much higher than for finite - scale networks . in the paper </S>",
    "<S> we will show that this implies for uncorrelated simple graphs that the number of allowed distinguishable simple graphs given a certain degree distribution is minimized for scale - free networks . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that in the swapping algorithm for randomizing a network @xcite the number of different graphs one can sample is actually reduced for scale free networks with low exponent @xmath20 .    in order to define our partition function we consider a network with @xmath18 nodes and @xmath21 edges . </S>",
