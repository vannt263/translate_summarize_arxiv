    "the recent release of the planck  2015 data provides improved experimental results and bounds on the @xmath0cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "in particular , the observation @xcite of a tensor - to - scalar ratio as big as @xmath1 can now be completely explained by a foreground dust contamination of the signal , and is replaced by the upper bound .",
    "moreover , for the spectral index planck  2015 reports @xmath2 and for its running @xmath3 .    as a consequence ,",
    "large - field inflationary potentials of the type @xmath4 are essentially ruled out for @xmath5 , and the currently best class of models fitting the data is plateau - like @xcite .",
    "this class contains the starobinsky model @xcite , as well as more general starobinsky - like models @xmath6 ( see also @xcite , as well as @xcite for a historical perspective on the starobinsky model ) .",
    "starobinsky - like models have been constructed in string theory in the large volume scenario ( lvs ) , where the role of the inflaton is played by a canonically normalized khler modulus @xcite .    when working with a model of large - field inflation , planck suppressed higher - order operators need to be controlled , since otherwise they lead to an @xmath7-problem .",
    "for the lvs , corrections are suppressed by an exponentially large volume , while in the case of the inflaton being an axion , the shift symmetry of the latter can protect the potential against perturbative corrections . various scenarios for axion inflation have been constructed , such as natural inflation  @xcite , , or aligned inflation  @xcite .",
    "another promising string - theoretic approach , still allowing for some control over the higher - order corrections , is axion monodromy inflation @xcite , for which a field theory version has been proposed in @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "this scenario has been realized via the f - term scalar potential induced by background fluxes , which has the advantage that supersymmetry is broken spontaneously by the very same effect by which usually moduli are stabilized .",
    "such models were studied in @xcite for the possibility to provide a quadratic potential for the axion .    in this letter",
    ", we analyze a toy model for the flux - induced scalar potential for a large excursion of a prospective axion / inflaton . for concreteness , we consider a simple type iib superstring flux compactification , where a superpotential for all moduli is generated by turning on ns - ns and r - r three - form fluxes as well as non - geometric fluxes .",
    "following @xcite , taking the backreaction of the stabilized moduli onto the evolution of the inflaton into account , we find the expected flattening of the uplifted potential , which after canonical normalization interpolates between a quadratic and a starobinsky - like form . here",
    "we discuss the cosmological consequences of this model , whereas more details on the formal framework and on the phenomenology will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "let us recall the expressions of the cosmological parameters for the large - field polynomial and starobinsky - like inflationary models .",
    "for polynomial inflation with @xmath8 , the slow - roll parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be written in the following way @xmath11 and the number of e - foldings is expressed as @xmath12 this implies that @xmath13 , and the spectral index , its running and the tensor - to - scalar ratio are obtained as @xmath14 for the starobinsky - like model , the slow - roll parameters become @xmath15 so that @xmath16 independently of the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for @xmath20 e - foldings this gives the experimental value @xmath21 .",
    "note that @xmath22 and @xmath23 in agree with the values for a quadratic potential in , except that the tensor - to - scalar ratio comes out smaller .",
    "the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum takes the experimental value @xmath24 , and can be expressed as @xmath25 from this one can extract the hubble constant during inflation , and consequently the mass of the inflaton via @xmath26 .",
    "the relation @xmath27 then fixes the mass scale of inflation .",
    "we now turn to the framework of type iib orientifolds on calabi - yau ( cy ) threefolds , equipped with geometric and non - geometric fluxes .",
    "the ns - ns and r - r fluxes @xmath28 and @xmath29 generate a potential for the complex - structure and axio - dilaton moduli , where the latter is written as @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 denoting the r - r zero - form .",
    "non - geometric @xmath33-fluxes can generate a tree - level potential for the khler moduli @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes a four - cycle volume ( in einstein frame ) and @xmath36 is the r - r four - form reduced on that cycle .",
    "the details for such flux compactifications have been worked out in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting scalar potential reads @xmath37 which is computed from the khler potential @xmath38 and the flux - induced superpotential @xmath39 note that here @xmath40 denotes the volume of the calabi - yau manifold ( in einstein frame ) , and that we have assumed a large - volume and small string - coupling regime so that higher - order corrections can safely be ignored . as usual ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the periods of the holomorphic three - form @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the flux quanta of @xmath29 , @xmath28 and @xmath33 .    to be more specific , let us consider a simple case of a cy manifold with no complex - structure moduli and just one khler modulus .",
    "one might think of it as an isotropic six - torus with fixed complex structure . in this case",
    "the khler potential is given by @xmath47 next , we turn on fluxes to generate the superpotential @xmath48 with @xmath49",
    ". the resulting scalar potential in units of @xmath50 reads @xmath51 which only depends on @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and the linear combination of axions @xmath54 .",
    "one linear combination of axions is not stabilized by , but can receive a mass from non - perturbative effects .",
    "such ultra - light axions can become part of dark radiation @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "a mechanism to realize axion inflation together with moduli stabilization in string theory has been proposed .",
    "there the idea was to first stabilize all moduli except one axion by turning on fluxes proportional to a large parameter @xmath55 , and in a second step stabilize the massless axion by introducing a deformation depending on additional small fluxes .",
    "the resulting superpotential takes the schematic form @xmath56 instead of analyzing the resulting potential for the rather complicated fully fledged models presented in @xcite , in this letter we mimic the resulting structure of the scalar potential by introducing a flux parameter @xmath55 in as @xmath57 we consider this as a ( partly exactly solvable ) toy model to analyze the possibility of realizing large - field inflation in string theory .",
    "solving now we find three solutions .",
    "besides the supersymmetric ads minimum with a tachyonic mode , there exists a non - supersymmetric , tachyon - free ads minimum at @xmath58 to ensure @xmath59 , for definiteness we chose all flux - quanta to be positive .",
    "furthermore , @xmath60 and @xmath61 implies weak string coupling and large radius , so we can ignore higher - order corrections to the scalar potential .",
    "the above fluxes also induce d3- and a d7-brane tadpole charges , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , that need to be cancelled by d - branes .",
    "to compute the mass eigenvalues and eigenstates in the canonically - normalized basis , we consider the matrix @xmath64 , with @xmath65 , evaluated at the minimum .",
    "we then find mass eigenvalues @xmath66 with the numerical factors @xmath67 the first two eigenstates are axionic while the last two are saxionic . in particular , the massless state corresponds to an axionic linear combination .",
    "note that for sufficiently large @xmath55 , the axion can be parametrically lighter than the two saxions .",
    "since the volume and the dilaton are fixed by fluxes , we can explicitly evaluate the string scale as @xmath68 recalling then and , we derive the ratio @xmath69",
    "we now consider the backreaction effect of a slowly rolling and sufficiently light axion @xmath70 , i.e. we take into account that during the rolling the moduli @xmath53 and @xmath52 adjust adiabatically .",
    "solving the extremum conditions for a non - vanishing value of @xmath70 , we find @xmath71 for large @xmath55 , the motion in the full four - dimensional field space is well - described by ; for @xmath55 of order one the trajectories differ , but qualitatively our results are still valid .",
    "note also that for large excursions of @xmath70 , the values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 are in the perturbative regime , so that higher - order @xmath74- and @xmath75-corrections to the scalar potential are under control .",
    "using in the potential and performing a constant uplift to vanishing cosmological constant in the minimum , gives the following backreacted effective inflaton potential ( in units of @xmath76 ) @xmath77 note that the initial simple quadratic potential is changed ; the expected flattening of the potential becomes evident in figure [ bild1 ] .     shown in in units of @xmath78 for fluxes @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . for this large value of @xmath55 ,",

    "we remark that a non - constant uplift term of the form @xmath84 with @xmath85 small is also possible .",
    "computing the mass eigenvalues for each value of @xmath70 , we find that for large @xmath70 the eigenvalue along the trajectory becomes tachyonic while the two transversal ones are positive .",

    "the shift in the value of the minimum is small and the potential takes a quadratic form @xmath89 employing , the total kinetic energy @xmath90 determines the kinetic term for @xmath70 . to find the latter , we need to determine for every value of @xmath70 the orthogonal combination @xmath91 of axions",
    "this can be fixed as @xmath92 so that the axionic terms in become @xmath93 for small @xmath70 this leads to a @xmath70-dependence of the form @xmath94 , and thus the canonically - normalized inflaton takes the form @xmath95 .",
    "note also that @xmath88 implies @xmath96 .",

    "note that @xmath19 is independent of the fluxes , but it depends on @xmath55 .",
    "it can also be shown that , for appropriate initial conditions , @xmath103 vanishes along the trajectory .",
    "canonically normalizing the inflaton via @xmath104 the potential in the large - field regime becomes starobinsky - like @xmath105 we emphasize that in contrast to the potential in the small - field regime , the potential is exponential due to the backreaction .    in the intermediate regime @xmath106 , it is not possible to take the canonical normalization into account analytically .",
    "however , we show below that the full backreacted potential interpolates between a quadratic and a starobinsky - like form .",
    "let us discuss how inflation can take place in this set - up , and how its features depend on the value of @xmath55 . here",
