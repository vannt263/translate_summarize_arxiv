    "neutrinos are members of the three lepton families .",
    "other particles that are members of the families are , correspondingly , the electron @xmath3 , the muon @xmath4 and the tau @xmath5 .",
    "there are also three families of other elementary particles , the quarks : ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 )    there are three fundamental interactions of elementary particles that are characterized by the strength of the interaction : strong , electromagnetic and weak .",
    "there is also the fourth gravitational interaction between particles .",
    "however , it is so weak that it can be neglected at all available energies .",
    "the strong interaction is the interaction between quarks and gluons , neutral particles with spin 1 .",
    "the interaction between quarks is the result of the exchange of gluons .",
    "protons , neutrons , pions and all other hadrons are bound states of quarks .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction is the interaction between charged particles and @xmath12 -quanta .",
    "the coulomb interaction between charged particles is due to the exchange of photons .",
    "atoms of different elements are bound states of electrons and nuclei .",
    "the weak interaction is the interaction between fundamental fermions ( quarks , charged leptons , neutrinos ) and charged @xmath13 and neutral @xmath14 bosons , heavy particles with spin 1 .",
    "for example , the @xmath15-decay of the neutron @xmath16 is due to the exchange of a charged @xmath17- boson between @xmath18 and @xmath19 pair in nucleons . because of weak and electromagnetic interactions , all particles , except the electron , proton and neutrinos are unstable .",

    "the investigation of neutrino processes allows to one obtain important information on the structure of the weak interaction .",
    "the detailed study of the scattering of high energy neutrinos on nucleons was very important for the establishment of quark structure of the nucleons .",

    "neutrinos are also exceptional particles because of their internal properties .",
    "the masses of the neutrinos are much smaller than the masses of the corresponding family partners .",
    "because of small neutrino masses and the so called neutrino mixing new neutrino processes _ neutrino oscillations _ , periodical transitions between different flavor neutrinos , become possible .",
    "recently evidence in favor of neutrino oscillations was found in the super - kamiokande experiment in japan .",
    "this discovery and also the discovery of the deficit of solar neutrinos by the homestake and other solar neutrino experiments opened a new field of research in neutrino physics : the physics of massive and mixed neutrinos .",

    "wu et al the parity violation in @xmath24 -decay was discovered .",
    "3 .   in 1958 in the experiment of m. goldhaber et al the helicity of the neutrino was measured and evidence for the left - handed two - component neutrino was obtained .",
    "4 .   in 1962 in the brookhaven experiment the second type of neutrino , the muon neutrino , was discovered . in 1988 for this discovery l.lederman , j. steinberger , and m. schwartz were rewarded the nobel prize for this discovery .",
    "5 .   in 1973 in experiments at the neutrino beam at cern a new type of weak interaction , neutral currents , was discovered .",
    "6 .   in the eighties in experiments on the measurement of deep inelastic scattering of neutrinos on nucleons the quark structure of nucleons was revealed and established .",
    "7 .   in 1970 in the experiment of r. davis et al neutrinos from the sun were detected . in these experiments and also in the gallex , sage , kamiokande and super - kamiokande solar neutrino experiments the existence of a solar neutrino problem ( deficit of solar @xmath0 s ) was discovered 8 .   in 1987 , in the kamiokande , imb and baksan experiments , neutrinos from the explosion of the supernova sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud were detected .",
    "9 .   in 1998 , in the super - kamiokande experiment",
    ", compelling evidence in favor of oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos was found .",
    "@xmath25    here we present at an elementary level only the basics of neutrinos in particle physics .",
    "those , who like to study this interesting and exciting field of physics must read the original papers and books .",
    "some books and recent reviews are listed in the bibliography .",
    "the history of the neutrino started in 1930 with the proposal of w. pauli . at that time",
    "the electron @xmath3 and proton @xmath26 were considered as the only elementary particles .",
    "it was assumed that the nuclei of all elements heavier than hydrogen are bound states of electrons and protons .    in the framework of this assumption",
    "there were two fundamental problems .",
    "the first problem was connected with the spectrum of energies of electrons in @xmath15-decay , the process of the decay of a nucleus with emission of an electron .",
    "if some nucleus @xmath27 is transferred into another nucleus @xmath28 with the emission of an electron then , according to the law of the conservation of the energy and momentum , the energy of the electron must be approximately equal to @xmath29 ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 are masses of the initial and final nucleus ) .",
    "however , in experiments on the investigation of @xmath15-decay a continuous spectrum of energies @xmath32 up to @xmath33 was observed .",
    "the second problem was the problem of the spin of the nitrogen @xmath34 and other nuclei .",
    "the atomic number of @xmath35 is equal to 14 and the charge of the nucleus is equal to 7@xmath36 . if we assume that nuclei are bound states of protons and electrons , the @xmath34 nucleus is a bound state of 14 protons and 7 electrons .",
    "the spins of the proton and electron are equal to 1/2 .",
    "thus , for the spin of the @xmath34 nucleus we will obtain half - integer value .",
    "however , from experiments on the investigation of the spectrum of @xmath34 molecules it was known that @xmath34 nuclei satisfy bose statistics and , according to the theorem on the connection between spin and statistics , the spin of the @xmath34 nucleus must be an integer .",
    "this problem was known as the  nitrogen catastrophe \" .    in order to solve these problems pauli assumed that there exists in nature a neutral particle with spin 1/2 , mass less than the electron mass and with a mean free path much larger than the mean free path of a photon .",
    "pauli called this particle `` neutron '' and he assumed that not only @xmath26 s and @xmath36 s but also `` neutron '' s are constituents of nuclei .",
    "this assumption allowed him to solve easily the problem of the spin of nitrogen and other nuclei .",
    "in fact , if in the @xmath34 nucleus there are an odd number of `` neutrons '' the spin of this nucleus will be an integer .    in order to explain @xmath15-spectra , pauli assumed that in the process of @xmath15-decay the electron is emitted together with a `` neutron '' which is not detected in an experiment because of its large mean free path .",
    "the energy released in @xmath15 -decay is shared between the electron and `` neutron '' and as a result the continuous spectrum of energies of electrons will be observed .    in 1932 the particle that today is called the neutron ( the particle with a mass approximately equal to the mass of the proton and the spin equal to 1/2 ) was discovered by j. chadwick in the nuclear reaction    @xmath37    soon after the discovery of the neutron , it was assumed independently by w. heisenberg , e. majorana and d. ivanenko that the real constituents of nuclei are protons and neutrons .",
    "this assumption allowed to explain all existing nuclear data . in particular , according to this assumption the nucleus @xmath34 is a bound state of 7 protons and 7 neutrons and the spin of this nucleus must be an integer .",
    "thus , the  nitrogen catastrophe \" disappeared .",
    "in 1933 - 34 e. fermi proposed the first theory of the @xmath15-decay of nuclei .",
    "the fermi theory was based on the assumption that nuclei are bound states of protons and neutrons and on the pauli hypothesis of the existence of a neutral , light , spin 1/2 particle with a large mean free path .",
    "fermi baptized this particle with the name neutrino ( from italian neutral , small ) .",
    "following pauli , fermi assumed that in @xmath15- decay the electron is emitted together with the neutrino .",
    "the problem was to understand how an electron - neutrino pair is emitted from a nucleus which is a bound state of protons and neutrons .",
    "for fermi it was important an analogy with electrodynamics . according to quantum electrodynamics in the transition of an electron from an excited state of an atom into a lower state",
    "a photon is emitted . in analogy with",
    "this process fermi assumed that the electron - neutrino pair _ is produced in the process of the quantum transition _ of a neutron inside a nucleus into a proton    @xmath38    the first theory of @xmath15- decay was also built by fermi in close analogy with quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the main quantity of the quantum field theory is the density of the energy of the interaction , that is called the hamiltonian of the interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian of the electromagnetic interaction has the form of the scalar product of the electromagnetic current @xmath39 and the electromagnetic field @xmath40",
    "@xmath41    where the sum over @xmath42 is assumed . the electric charge @xmath36 characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the electromagnetic current @xmath43 is a 4-vector .",
    "the time component @xmath44 is the density of charge and the space components @xmath45 ( @xmath46=1,2,3 ) are components of the vector current .",
    "the electromagnetic field @xmath47 is also a 4-vector : @xmath48 is a scalar potential and @xmath49 are components of a vector potential .",
    "the electromagnetic current of protons is given by    @xmath50    here @xmath51 are the dirac matrices and @xmath52 is the proton field .    in analogy with ( 5 )",
    "fermi assumed that the hamiltonian of @xmath15- decay had the form of the scalar product of the proton - neutron and electron - neutrino currents    @xmath53    here @xmath54 is the constant that characterize the strength of the @xmath15 -decay interaction ( @xmath55 is called fermi constant)@xmath56 is the field of neutrons , @xmath57 is the field of electrons and @xmath58 is the field of neutrino .    in quantum field theory @xmath59 is the operator which annihilates the neutron in the initial state , the operator @xmath60 creates the proton in the final state and the operators @xmath61 and @xmath58 create the final electron and neutrino .",
    "the fermi theory allows one to describe the @xmath15- decay of different nuclei .",
    "this theory , however , could not describe all @xmath15- decay data . in 1936",
    "gamov and teller generalized the fermi theory by including in the hamiltonian additional scalar , tensor , pseudovector and pseudoscalar terms with four additional interaction constants .    all @xmath15- decay data , existing at that time , could be described by the fermi - gamov - teller interaction .",
    "this was an indirect evidence of the correctness of the pauli - fermi hypothesis of the neutrino .",
    "the direct proof of the existence of the neutrino was obtained only in the beginning of the fifties in the f. reines and c.l .",
    "cowan experiment .",
    "we will discuss this experiment in the next section .",
    "let us start with a discussion of the notion of _ lepton number _ .",
    "as is well known , the total electric charge is conserved .",
    "this means that only such processes are allowed in which the sums of the electric charges of the initial and final particles are equal .    according to quantum field theory every charged particle has its _ antiparticle _ , a particle with the same mass and spin but opposite charge .",
    "this general consequence of quantum field theory is confirmed by all existing experimental data .",
    "the antiparticle of the electron is the positron .",
    "the electron and the positron have the same mass and the same spin and the electric charges of the electron and positron are equal to @xmath62 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the existence of the positron was predicted on the basis of the dirac theory of the electron .",
    "the positron was discovered by c.d .",
    "anderson in 1932 .",
    "the antiparticle of the proton is the antiproton @xmath63 , a particle with electric charge equal to @xmath62 and a mass equal to the proton mass .",
    "the antiproton was discovered in 1955 by o. chamberlain , e.g. segre et al .",
    "the antineutron @xmath64 was discovered in 1956 and so on .    except electric charge there",
    "exist other conserved charges .",
    "one such charge is the _",
    "baryon number_. the baryon numbers of @xmath26 and @xmath65 are equal to 1 and -1 , respectively .",
    "the baryon numbers of the @xmath66 -mesons , @xmath67 , @xmath68-quantum and other bosons are equal to zero .",
    "due to the conservation of the baryon number the proton is a stable particle .",
    "let us now return to the neutrino .",
    "the fact that the neutrino is produced in @xmath15-decay together with an electron suggests that there exist some conserved quantum number that characterizes these particles .",
    "this number is called lepton number .",
    "let us assume that the lepton numbers of the electron and the neutrino are equal to 1 and lepton numbers of the proton , neutron , photon and other particles are equal to zero . according to the general theorem , we mentioned before",
    ", the lepton number of the positron is equal to -1 and the antineutrino , the particle with the lepton number equal to -1 , must exist . from the conservation of lepton number it follows that in @xmath15-decay together with an electron an _ antineutrino _ is emitted .",
    "we will discuss later the experiment in which evidence in favor of conservation of lepton number was obtained .",
    "now we will consider the experiment of f. reines and c.l .",
    "cowan in which the ( anti)neutrino was discovered . in this experiment antineutrinos that are produced in @xmath15-decays of different nuclei , products of the fission of @xmath69 and @xmath70 in a reactor , were detected via the observation of the process    @xmath71    a reactor is a very intense source of antineutrinos : about @xmath72 antineutrinos per second are emitted per kw , generated by the reactor .",
    "the power of a modern reactor is about 4 gw . thus , about @xmath73 antineutrinos are emitted by a reactor per second .",
    "the experiment of reines and cowan was done at the savannah river reactor in usa .",
    "the detector in this experiment was a liquid scintillator loaded with cadmium .",
    "the positron , produced in the process ( 7 ) , quickly slowed down to rest and annihilated with an electron into two @xmath12-quanta with energies about @xmath74 , moving in opposite directions .",
    "these @xmath12-quanta were detected by photomultipliers connected with scintillators .",
    "the neutron produced in the process ( 7 ) was slowed down and was captured by a cadmium nucleus emitting @xmath12-quanta with total energy about 9mev .",
    "these @xmath12-quanta give a several microseconds delayed signal in the photomultipliers .",
    "the probability of interaction is characterized in physics by the _ cross section _ that has dimension of ( length)@xmath75 . in order to determine the cross section we will consider the flux of the particles that pass through the matter .",
    "let us consider the element of the volume of the target with unit area oriented perpendicular to the momentum @xmath76 ( see fig .",
    "1 )    . ]",
    "the number of particles of the target in this volume is equal to @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is the number density of the target ) .",
    "the cross section @xmath79 of a process of scattering , absorption , ... is the probability of the process per one particle in the target and per unit flux . for the change of the flux after passing trough the element , shown in fig .  1 we have    @xmath80    from ( [ del])we obtain    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the distance that the particles pass in the matter .",
    "we can rewrite ( [ ix ] ) in the form    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the mean free path .    for the cross section of the process",
    "( [ nup ] ) in the experiment of reines and cowan the following value was found @xmath85    this is a very small cross section .",
    "let us consider the propagation of reactor antineutrinos with an energy of a few mev in the earth .",
    "we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 protons per @xmath88 .",
    "thus , for the mean free path of a neutrino in the earth we have @xmath89 km .",
    "remember that the earth s diameter is about @xmath90 km .",
    "thus , the probability for an antineutrino with an energy of a few mev to interact with the matter of the earth is about @xmath91 !",
    "the fact that the neutrino and the antineutrino are different particles was established in the reactor experiment of r. davis in 1955 . as we discussed earlier ,",
    "a reactor is a source of _",
    "antineutrinos_. if the lepton number is conserved , the reaction @xmath92 is forbidden . in the davis experiment a large tank with carbon tetrachloride ( @xmath93 ) liquid",
    "was irradiated over a long period of time by antineutrinos from the reactor .",
    "after every run atoms of @xmath94 were extracted from the liquid by purging it with @xmath95 gas and they were put into a low - background geiger counter . the @xmath12-quanta produced in the @xmath3 capture by @xmath96 were detected .",
    "no effect was observed .",
    "for the cross section of the process ( [ clar ] ) it was found that @xmath97 if the neutrino and the antineutrino had been identical , for the cross section of the process ( [ clar ] ) the following value @xmath98 would have been expected .",
    "in 1956 in an experiment by c.s .",
    "wu et al nonconservation of parity in @xmath15-decay was discovered . this was a very important discovery in particle physics that drastically changed our understanding of the weak interaction and the neutrino .    in order to explain the phenomenon of parity violation we must remember that there are two types of vectors : ( true ) vectors and pseudovectors .",
    "the direction of a vector does not depend on the choice of the coordinate system .",
    "the direction of a pseudovector is changed if we change the handedness of the coordinate system .",
    "typical vectors are momentum , coordinate , electric field etc .",
    "angular momentum , spin , magnetic field etc are pseudovectors .",
    "let us consider two coordinate systems : some right - handed system and a system with all axes directed opposite to the direction of the axes of the first system .",
    "the second system is left - handed one .",
    "if some vector @xmath99 has components @xmath100 ( i=1,2,3 ) in the first system , in the second system the coordinates of this vector will be @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath102 is pseudovector with coordinates @xmath103 in the first system , then in the second system its coordinates will be @xmath103 ( pseudovector changes direction ) .",
    "the transformation from the first system to the second one is called inversion or parity transformation .    in the wu et al experiment the @xmath15-decay of polarized nuclei",
    "@xmath104 nuclei was investigated .",
    "the polarization ( the average value of the spin ) is a pseudovector .",
    "let us consider in a right - handed system the emission of an electron at an angle @xmath105 between the direction of the polarization of the nucleus and the electron momentum ( see fig .  2 ) .     by a nucleus with polarization @xmath106 ( right - handed system ) .",
    "]    in the left - handed system the direction of the polarization is reversed and fig .",
    "2 corresponds to the emission of an electron at an angle @xmath107 - @xmath105 ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the emission of an electron at the angle @xmath107 - @xmath105 in the right - handed system corresponds to the emission of an electron at the angle @xmath105 in the left - handed system .",
    "thus , right - handed and left - handed systems are equivalent ( the parity is conserved ) if the number of electrons emitted ( in a fixed system ) at the angles @xmath105 and @xmath107 - @xmath105 are equal .    in the experiment of wu et al a large asymmetry of the emission of the electrons with respect to the polarization of the nuclei",
    "was discovered .",
    "it was observed that electrons are emitted predominantly in the direction opposite to the direction of the polarization of the nuclei .",
    "thus , it was proved that parity is not conserved in @xmath15-decay ( the left - handed and right - handed systems are not equivalent ) .",
    "later it was shown that parity is not conserved in other weak processes .",

    "thus , if parity is conserved the probabilities of emission of the left - handed neutrino @xmath108 and the right - handed neutrino @xmath109 ( in a fixed system ) must be the same : @xmath110 the discovery of the nonconservation of parity in weak interactions means that these probabilities are not equal .    in 1957",
    "landau , lee and yang and salam proposed the theory of the _ two component neutrino_. this theory is based on the assumption that the mass of the neutrino is equal to zero . according to the theory of the two - component neutrino for the neutrino there are only two possibilities :    1 .   the neutrino is a left - handed particle @xmath108 and the antineutrino is a right - handed antiparticle @xmath111 ; 2 .",
