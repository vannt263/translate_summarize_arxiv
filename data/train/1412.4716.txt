    "* ) constrains the apparent number density of ultrahigh - energy cosmic - ray ( uhecr ) sources in local universe @xmath7 mpc@xmath8 in the case of small deflections .",
    "it disfavors rare promising source candidates , e.g. , fanaroff - riley ii galaxies and blazars , as a dominant contributor to the observed uhecr intensity @xcite .",
    "quantitative constraints depend on magnetic deflection and therefore the composition of the uhecrs , because larger deflection angles for heavy nuclei with a given energy provide weaker anisotropy constraints ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the dependence of anisotropy on cr energy , if detected , can give statistical evidence for the transient generation of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "anisotropy is also useful for examining the composition of uhecrs independently of measurements of maximum atmospheric slant depth @xmath9 of extensive air showers induced by uhecrs .",
    "if anisotropy is measured for heavy nuclei with energy @xmath10 and atomic number @xmath11 , a comparable anisotropy should be produced by protons with energy @xmath12 , because the propagation trajectories of charged particles depend only on particle rigidity when energy loss is negligible @xcite .",
    "this statement was tested with @xmath9 measurements by the pao , which has provided the largest uhecr sample available for analysis .",
    "the pao collaboration reports a gradual change of composition to heavy nuclei above the ankle energy for a variety of hadronic interaction models @xcite .",
    "no significant anisotropy is found at lower energies @xcite , indicating that either 1 ) protons dominate the composition at the highest energies and hadronic interaction models should be modified accordingly , 2 ) the observed anisotropy is a statistical fluctuation , or 3 ) uhecr sources selectively emit heavy nuclei over a wide energy range .",
    "gamma rays provide another important probe of uhecr sources .",
    "electromagnetic cascades are induced by secondary particles produced by interactions of uhecrs with photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and extragalactic background light ( ebl ) during propagation through intergalactic space .",
    "very - high - energy ( vhe ; @xmath13 gev ) @xmath14-ray observations have resulted in the detections of several extreme high - frequency - peaked bl lac objects ( ehbls ) , most notably 1es 0229 + 200 , 1es 1101 - 232 , and 1es 0347 - 121 , which show very hard vhe spectra ( @xmath15 ) extending to tens of tev ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . moreover ,",
    "these sources show weak variability , unlike most blazars .",
    "vhe @xmath14 rays can be attenuated by pair - creation interactions with ebl photons while propagating through intergalactic space @xcite .",
    "a possible scenario to overcome the severe absorption that would soften the tev spectra of these sources is the uhecr - induced cascade model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model ,",
    "the long ( @xmath16 gpc ) energy - loss length from bethe - heitler pair creation of uhecr protons with cmb and ebl photons allows the detection of vhe photons with energies above the characteristic ebl attenuation energy at which the optical depth of pair creation with the ebl is unity .",
    "this will produce a spectrum that is harder than expected if @xmath14-rays are emitted at the blazar source .",
    "a synchrotron self - compton model , which is the standard scenario for explaining the spectral energy distribution of bl lac objects , might still be viable by assuming very large minimum lorentz factors of electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though it does not provide a simple explanation for the weak tev variability of these ehbls .",
    "the spectral hardness above the characteristic ebl attenuation energy , depending on source redshift , can confirm the uhecr - induced cascade model , if identified by next generation @xmath14-ray telescopes such as cherenkov telescope array @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the uhecr - induced cascade model also requires that uhecrs maintain strong collimation as they travel through intergalactic space .",
    "consequently a strong anisotropy of uhecrs in the directions of ehbls , if they are powerful uhecr emitters , can be expected in order to produce the observed point - like images and keep the @xmath14-ray conversion efficiency high @xcite .",
    "the effective extragalactic magnetic field @xmath17 averaged over the uhecr s path is required to be @xmath18 g ( assuming a coherence length @xmath19  1 mpc ) in order that @xmath1 ev proton propagate through intergalactic space from sources at a distance of @xmath20 gpc with deflections @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , much weaker fields of @xmath22 g in intergalactic voids are required in order that the bethe - heitler pairs are not deflected away from the line of sight .",
    "the uhecr - induced cascade model requires , moreover , a huge energy output in uhecrs .",
    "an isotropic equivalent cr luminosity @xmath23 erg s@xmath24 is needed to reconcile the predicted @xmath14-ray fluxes with the observed fluxes @xcite .",

    "the reference values of @xmath28 mpc@xmath8 and @xmath29 mpc@xmath8 correspond to the local number density of uhecr sources constrained by anisotropy measurements and that of bl lac objects @xcite , respectively .",
    "thus , small - scale anisotropy is naturally expected in the directions of uhecr sources if they are powerful and rare .    in this paper",
    ", we use numerical simulations to provide a general study of the anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of uhecrs produced by distant powerful uhecr sources .",

    "the effects of magnetic fields associated with cosmic structures are also discussed .",
    "then , we focus on specific objects classified as ehbls , namely 1es 0229 + 200 , 1es 1101 - 232 , and 1es 0347 - 121 , and derive conditions that the uhecr - induced cascade model must satisfy in order to be consistent with the observed uhecr arrival distribution .",
    "we also consider the effects of the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) on the arrival direction distribution of uhecrs .    throughout this study",

    "this outline of the paper is as follows : section [ sec : methods ] presents the methods to calculate and analyze the arrival direction distribution of uhecrs from a strong uhecr emitter . in section [ sec : ul ] , we derive upper limits on the cr luminosity of a strong uhecr source located at various redshifts .",
    "anisotropy in the uhecr sky produced by several representative ehbls in the uhecr - induced cascade model , and the conditions required to reconcile the cascade model with the observed isotropic sky , are presented in section [ sec : app_ehbls ] .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] , and we summarize in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "uhecr events in our simulations consist of events from a powerful source as well as events from an isotropic uhecr background .",
    "the former events are numerically calculated by considering interactions with cosmic background photons and the deflections of uhecr trajectories by cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "the model of cosmic magnetic fields adopted in these simulations is explained in section [ sec : mag ] , and the method to calculate the arrival distribution of uhecrs is described in section [ sec : ad ] .",
    "the number of events from a given source can be calculated by multiplying the cr luminosity of the source , the probability distribution of arrival events , and the exposure geometry of a specific uhecr detector , as described in section [ sec : aperture ] .",
    "background events are calculated as events isotropically distributed according to a detection probability that follows the aperture geometry , and whose number is the total number of expected events calculated from the uhecr spectrum under an assumed total exposure minus the number of events from the source . in this study , the analytical fitting formula to the latest pao spectrum is applied @xcite .    the arrival direction distribution of uhecrs obtained from the simulations is quantified by the cumulative auto - correlation function of the events .",
    "we then compare this distribution with an isotropic distribution using the statistical method described in section [ sec : stat ] .",
    "we classify cosmic magnetic fields into four components defined in terms of uhecr propagation .",
    "first , all the uhecrs arriving at the earth are affected by the gmf .",
    "the shape of the gmf follows the spiral structure of the milky way , and therefore the deflection angles of uhecrs depend on their arrival directions .",
    "we consider the gmf only when we focus on specific sources with known positions ( section [ sec : app_ehbls ] ) . in this study , a bisymmetric spiral field model with the parametrization of @xcite",
    "is adopted for demonstration , although more sophisticated gmf models due to the progress of observations have been recently proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "dependence on gmf configurations to the arrival distribution of uhecrs are discussed in detail in @xcite and @xcite .    among extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmfs ) , intergalactic magnetic fields in voids ( under - dense regions away from the sources )",
    "are poorly known , but lower limits can be placed by searches for @xmath14-ray pair halos @xcite and pair echoes @xcite , where one can determine magnetic fields that are strong enough for e@xmath36-e@xmath37 pairs made by ebl absorption of tev @xmath14 rays to be deflected , in order that cmb photons compton - scattered to gev energies do not overproduce the fermi - lat observations .",
    "these void fields @xmath38 g for persistent sources , and @xmath39 g for sources operating on timescales of the tev observations are derived from spectral observations @xcite .",
    "the uhecr - induced cascade model requires @xmath40 g for reasons noted above , and the effective magnetic field , @xmath17 , averaged over structures such as filaments and clusters with small volume - filling fraction and the voids that dominate the volume of the universe is @xmath41 g ( see @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic structure formation theory indicates that galaxies and other astrophysical objects that could be uhecr sources are typically embedded in dense concentrations of matter .",
    "egmfs in the over - dense structured regions affect the propagation of uhecrs through and out of the structure , which is important to consider in the uhecr - cascade model @xcite and for synchrotron pair echoes and halos @xcite . as a result , for a given beaming - corrected cr luminosity",
    ", the isotropic - equivalent cr luminosity @xmath42 estimated for crs is significantly smaller than the intrinsic isotropic - equivalent cr luminosity @xmath43 , especially if uhecrs are emitted from collimated jets @xcite .",
    "the former isotropic - equivalent cr luminosity @xmath42 is related to cr observables and is the cr luminosity estimated from @xmath14-ray observations in the uhecr - induced cascade model when the beaming angle of crs is not altered .",
    "the latter one is specific for a source population .",
    "these two cr luminosities are the same if there is no magnetic structure surrounding uhecr sources .",
    "when one takes into account egmfs around the source , the intrinsic cr luminosity can be @xmath44 ",
    "@xmath45 for sources with a beaming angle of @xmath46 .",
    "accordingly , the number density of observed beamed sources is smaller than that of uhecr sources .",
    "note that these egmfs does not affect the angular spread of the images of arrival uhecrs as long as the distance of sources is much greater than the size of magnetic structures .",
    "the milky way is contained within large - scale structure of matter , including filamentary structures and the local supercluster of galaxies , which will be accompanied by magnetic field .",
    "this local egmf ( legmf ) surrounding the milky way also inevitably affects the distribution of arriving uhecrs and is more relevant to diminish the anisotropy of uhecrs assumed to be propagating rectilinearly in intergalactic space , which is satisfied especially in the uhecr - induced cascade model . in this paper",
    "we show that this legmf can play a key role in reducing the expected anisotropy in the direction of ehbls in comparison with the observed isotropy at @xmath1 ev , as discussed in section [ sec : app_ehbls ] . a similar ( but",
    "larger ) magnetic structure was taken into account to isotropize uhecrs emitted from nearby powerful sources inside this structure in order to overcome the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin @xcite cutoff @xcite .",
    "although being poorly known , the properties of the milky way s legmf are expected to be similar to those magnetic fields found in filamentary structures or clusters of galaxies .",
    "although it does not have to hold in general , the copernican principle , in which all galaxies are surrounded by magnetized structures , can be satisfied , as we discuss in section 5 .",
    "following @xcite , we model this local magnetic structure surrounding our galaxy as a spherically magnetized region with 2 mpc radius , magnetic field strength @xmath47 , and magnetic coherence length @xmath48 kpc .",
    "note that this spherical structure is a simple approximation of a part of cosmic magnetized structures , not intending a structure specific to the galaxy .",
    "the value of @xmath47 depends on where we reside in the local large scale structure .",
    "we consider values for the egmf of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ng .",
    "note that values of @xmath53 ng and @xmath52 ng are expected to be comparable with magnetic fields in filamentary structures and average magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies obtained in detailed simulations @xcite .",
    "uhecrs emitted from a source suffer energy losses during propagation through intergalactic space to the earth .",
    "we calculate the propagation processes with the method used by @xcite .",
    "the energy - loss processes that are treated in the monte - carlo forward - tracking calculation for uhe protons include bethe - heitler pair creation and photomeson production with the photons of the cmb and ebl , and adiabatic cooling by cosmic expansion .",
    "the low - ir ebl model of @xcite is adopted for the calculation .",
    "the generation spectrum of uhecrs is assumed to be described by a power - law function with an exponential cutoff given by the expression @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the injection energy , @xmath56 is the spectral cutoff energy , and @xmath57 is the spectral index .",
    "the two parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 depend on the properties of the uhecr source under consideration . in our study of the anisotropy produced by a powerful cr source ,",
    "we let @xmath58 ev . because the leptonic interpretation of the spectral energy distribution of bl lac objects ( other than ehbls ) indicates that the maximum acceleration energy of protons is @xmath5 ev @xcite , we additionally treat the case of @xmath59 ev . even in this latter case ,",
    "a fraction of uhecrs are found at energies @xmath60 ev because the spectrum is not sharply truncated at @xmath1 ev . as for the spectral index @xmath57",
    ", we choose a value that reproduces the spectral index of the total cr spectrum in the energy range near @xmath1 ev ( @xmath61 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as a hard - spectrum case with @xmath62 .",
    "the spectrum of uhecrs at the earth , @xmath63 , is determined following the propagation calculation .",
    "the number of detected protons above energy @xmath64 that are emitted from a source located in the direction ( @xmath65 ) in galactic coordinates is estimated as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are components in a polar coordinate centered by the source position , and @xmath69 .",
    "the threshold energy considered is @xmath70 ev throughout this paper because crs above @xmath1 ev are widely accepted to be of extragalactic origin , though the transition energy from galactic crs and extragalactic crs is still debated .",
    "the exposure of a specific experiment @xmath71 ( units of time ) is a function of declination @xmath72 $ ] , and is given in the next subsection .",
    "the spectral proton injection rate per solid angle from a source in the direction of earth is represented by @xmath73 .",
    "provided that only the local egmf and/or gmf are taken into account , this distribution is separable into the spectrum of uhecrs after propagation in intergalactic space and the angular distribution around the source direction generated by these magnetic fields .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath74 because the energy - loss of uhecrs can be neglected in the local magnetic structure surrounding the milky way where the propagation path is much shorter than the bethe - heitler energy - loss length . in comparison ,",
    "most of the bethe - heitler pair production and photomeson production takes place during transit through intergalactic space .",
    "the function @xmath75 is the convolution of the angular distribution of uhecrs generated by magnetic deflections in the legmf and the gmf with the angular determination accuracy of uhecr detectors .",
    "the angular spreading distribution of uhecrs in the local magnetic field is calculated by the method used in @xcite , which is essentially the same method as in @xcite and @xcite , though energy - loss processes are neglected in the legmf and gmf .",
    "we inject uhecrs from the origin of coordinates , calculate their trajectories in the magnetized sphere , and record their velocity directions when they reach the boundary of the sphere 2 mpc away from the center .",
    "the deflection angles of uhecrs can be estimated from the difference between their injection directions and the velocity directions .",
    "the distribution of the deflection angles can be approximated by a two - dimensional gaussian function if the deflections are small enough , but this approximation becomes poor when @xmath76 ng , and the distribution then has to be calculated numerically .    the modification of the arrival directions of uhecrs caused by the gmf is calculated by the backtracking method of uhecr propagation in the milky way ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this method , uhecrs with the opposite electric charge to protons are injected from the earth isotropically .",
    "the calculation of their propagation is stopped at the boundary of the milky way , which is chosen as 40 kpc from the galactic center , and their velocity directions are recorded .",
    "these recorded directions can be regarded as the arrival directions of uhecrs before gmf modification . in order to accurately calculate the modification function for the gmf ,",
    "we inject @xmath77 simulated uhecrs in each energy bin with the width of @xmath78 .",
    "the angular determination uncertainty is simulated by a two dimensional gaussian distribution with a @xmath79 68% containment radius .",
    "this is comparable with the angular arrival uncertainties of uhecrs measured with the pao @xcite .",
    "the actual exposure of a ground array is nonuniform in different directions of the sky because the array is at a fixed location on the ground . since the variation in right ascension in a day can be neglected when discussing anisotropy uncertainties at the @xmath80 level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the geometry of the exposure over a much longer time than day scale can simply be estimated as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 this differential exposure depends only on the declination of arrival crs . here ,",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 are the terrestrial latitude of a ground array and the zenith angle for an experimental cut , respectively @xcite .",
    "we adopt the configuration of pao , @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xcite ) and inclined ( @xmath88 ) events @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this paper considers only vertical events to simulate the pao in 2013 . ] , to simulate anisotropy produced by ehbls in section [ sec : app_ehbls ] , because all three ehbls considered in this study are located in the aperture of the pao . on the other hand , for a detector - independent study",
    ", we consider a uniform exposure to constrain the cr luminosity of a strong source in section [ sec : ul ] , where the total exposure can be treated as a parameter .      in this study ,",
    "anisotropy in the arrival - direction distribution of uhecrs is quantified by calculating an angular auto - correlation function .",
    "the angular event distribution from the direction of a specific source is a precise statistical quantity to measure anisotropy produced by powerful sources , as used in @xcite for centaurus a. this quantity is more sensitive to anisotropy than an angular auto - correlation function and therefore allows one to obtain stronger upper limits of cr luminosity , if source position is known _ a priori _ and the clustering center of uhecrs from a given source is conserved during propagation through the legmf .",
    "in fact , however , strong event clustering can appear away from the parent source position because the gmf strongly modifies the arrival directions of uhecrs .",
    "indeed , the deflection of focused crs ( @xmath5 ev ) by the gmf can be @xmath89 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", it may be difficult to trace back the source location from the arrival directions .",
    "we therefore adopt an angular auto - correlation function that allows us to study anisotropy in the sky without prior knowledge of the clustering center .",
    "the cumulative angular auto - correlation function is defined as @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 symbolize simulated cr events and events randomly distributed following the geometry of an experimental exposure @xmath71 , respectively @xcite .",

    "since the angular determination accuracy of typical uhecr experiments is @xmath101 , the auto - correlation function is evaluated in a grid of at least 180 points with @xmath102 .",

    "the significance of excess in the number of events over isotropic background can be estimated from the ratio of the number of excess events and the square root of background events within a radius comparable with the typical deflection angles of uhecrs .",

    "the strong isotropy at @xmath5 ev imposes upper bounds on the cr luminosity of a steady powerful uhecr source , depending on the source redshift and egmf .",
    "we have derived constraints for both current and future observations . this isotropy constraint is stronger than the cr luminosity implied by @xmath14-ray observations , in the framework of the uhecr - induced cascade model .",
    "the isotropic uhecr sky also restricts the existence of typical sources in the local universe and also provides a lower limit on the local source number density of uhecrs with @xmath5 ev .",
    "this lower limit on the apparent source number density is much larger than the inferred source number density of uhecrs above @xmath228 ev , which may indicate that uhecrs are generated transiently .",
    "note that the isotropy at @xmath5 ev is difficult to reconcile by assuming heavy ions , because composition measurements , depending on hadronic interaction models , imply light composition below @xmath5 ev .",
    "we also examined uhecr anisotropy produced by the ehbls 1es 0229 + 200 , 1es 0347 - 121 and 1es 1101 - 232 in the uhecr - induced cascade model , including effects of the gmf and egmf .",
    "the uhecr - induced model proposed by essey & kusenko ( 2010 ) has several attractive features , not least of which is to explain the weakly variable class of blazars , especially the ehbls considered here , and to account for unusual hard spectral features that appear when deabsorbing high - energy spectra of high - synchrotron - peaked bl lac objects for a wide range of ebl models . if there were no cosmic magnetic fields , ehbls would produce strong anisotropy in the uhecr sky at @xmath5 ev , which should be already detected by the pao unless the cr proton spectra of the ehbls end well below @xmath1 ev",
    "this would rule out the uhecr - induced cascade model under the hypothesis that blazars and their off - axis counterparts are sources of uhecrs .",
    "one possible way to maintain this model is if the observed isotropy at @xmath5 ev results from combined effects of a local extragalactic magnetic field ( legmf ) cosmic structure with @xmath229@xmath52 ng within which the milky way is embedded , in addition to deflections made by the gmf .",
    "measurements of cr anisotropy indicate that the uhecr - induced cascade model works in the cases that 1 ) the milky way is surrounded by a strongly magnetized structure ( @xmath200 a few ng ) if ehbls accelerate protons up to the highest energies , 2 ) the strength of the legmf is @xmath202 ng for the hard - spectrum case and lower magnetic fields are allowed for the steep - spectrum cases , or 3 ) a lower intrinsic maximum energy of protons , @xmath230 ev , is required .",
    "the nearly rectilinear propagation of uhecr protons required in the uhecr - induced cascade model is marginally compatible with the assumption that the milky way , all star - forming galaxies , and uhecr sources are surrounded by the magnetized structures hypothesized here , depending on the fraction of bl lac sources that display uhecr components , and observational selection biases favoring detection of blazars with uhecr components ( see section [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "if the uhecr - induced cascade model operates , the required intrinsic cr luminosity has to be 10 - 100 times larger , depending on the magnetic structure around the sources @xcite , it could be possible that nearby bright radio galaxies show anisotropy of the arrival directions of @xmath5 ev crs .",
    "additional uhecr array exposure will strengthen luminosity limits or detect anisotropy or clustering in uhecr arrival directions and help identify the sources of the uhecrs or , if not , could reveal clues to the existence of an extended magnetic medium in the legmf .",
