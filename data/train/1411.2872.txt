    "this led to the work of ruppeiner @xcite who wrote a riemannian thermodynamic entropy metric to represent thermodynamic fluctuation theory , and was the first to systematically calculate the thermodynamic ricci curvature scalar @xmath0 .",
    "a parallel effort was by andresen , salamon , and berry @xcite who began the systematic application of the thermodynamic entropy metric to finite - time thermodynamic processes .",
    "thermodynamic fluctuation theory @xcite is essential to the discussion of water s anomalies @xcite , for example , and @xmath0 is an inevitable element of this theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is a direct measure of the size of organized mesoscopic fluctuating structures in thermodynamic systems .",

    "the first indication of a repulsive / attractive sign interpretation for @xmath0 came from the quantum fermi / bose gasses , with uniformly positive / negative @xmath0 values ( in the @xmath0 sign convention used here .",
    "we could work equally well with the opposite sign convention , with the key point being that the sign of @xmath0 indicates different local geometry .",
    "our thesis here and elsewhere is that attractive interactions correspond locally to the 2-sphere , and repulsive interactions correspond locally to the pseudo 2-sphere .",
    "@xmath0 has been physically interpreted with an extension of einstein s thermodynamic fluctuation theory ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this extended theory includes covariance , conservation , and consistency , and clearly marks @xmath3 as a thermodynamic measure of the mesoscopic size scale where the character of fluctuations changes qualitatively due to fluctuating structures resulting from microscopic interactions .",
    "we point out that our discussion for two - parameter thermodynamic systems does not necessarily extend to three or more independent parameters .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that with three or more independent parameters , @xmath0 is still the dominant quantity .",

    "in addition , there is a narrow region with positive @xmath0 close to the melting line of ice iii , v , and vi .",

    "this region might reveal the presence of solid clusters in the gas.,width=259 ]    cold water is known for its anomalous behavior , including a density maximum at 4 c and ambient pressure .",
    "anomalous behavior is present as well in the isothermal compressibility @xmath34 , the isobaric heat capacity @xmath35 , and the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "both @xmath34 and @xmath35 increase as we cool isobarically into the metastable liquid state , while @xmath36 decreases .",
    "the rates of change increase as the temperature is lowered .",

    "microscopically , the source of water s anomalies appear to be the presence of open tetrahedrally - coordinated networks of water molecules held together by hydrogen bonds ( hb)@xcite .",
    "computer simulations contribute in a key way to this picture @xcite .    in the stable phase",

    "in recent studies of experimental data , mallamace _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the @xmath37 dependence of several thermodynamic response functions to find limits of regions with anomalous behavior .",
    "these authors reported that the isobaric density maximum is strongly @xmath26-dependent , and that it disappears above a certain crossover pressure @xmath38 , coinciding closely with the top of our positive @xmath0 narrow slab region in fig .",

    "our results also relate to a possible second critical point in water .",
    "starting in the narrow slab region , and lowering @xmath10 at constant @xmath26 into the supercooled liquid state , leads to negative and decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "this would be expected if there were a second critical point , since all of the known fluid critical point models tabulated in @xcite have @xmath0 decreasing to negative infinity at the critical point .",
    "the llcp is expected to be in the same universality class as the liquid - vapor critical point @xcite . clearly then",
    ", the narrow slab of positive @xmath0 must terminate at some lower value for @xmath10 , and this is indicated in the @xmath0-diagram fig .",
    "[ fig:2](d ) .",
    "water is the only one of the four fluids in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] with @xmath0 decreasing on cooling into the metastable liquid regime .",
    "recently , holten _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the behavior of metastable supercooled water assuming a llcp .",
    "we are in the process of making a detailed analysis of @xmath0 in this special region , and have confirmed that @xmath0 indeed diverges to negative infinity at the theoretical llcp .",
    "it is of some interest to examine our @xmath28 line in the supercritical state for compliance with other theoretical lines in this region , e.g. , the frenkel line @xcite , or the fisher - widom line @xcite .",
    "we could not find any correspondence with the frenkel line .",
    "a comparison with the fisher - widom line is difficult because the correct determination of this line is still an unsolved research issue .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a new tool for viewing fluid properties , the @xmath0-diagram , which reveals a number of features which are otherwise difficult to see .",
    "we presented @xmath0-diagrams for four fluids , and highlighted regions of positive @xmath0 , which we propose correspond in the liquid phase to solid - like features .",
    "water was found to be particularly interesting in this respect .",
    "since @xmath0 is the only thermodynamic geometric scalar invariant , it seems important to examine it for any system with known thermodynamics .",
