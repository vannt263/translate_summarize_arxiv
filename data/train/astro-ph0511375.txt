    "high frequency ( hundreds of hertz ) , quasiperiodic variations in x - ray fluxes have been detected in several galactic black hole sources by x - ray telescopes on spacecraft ( e.g. van der klis 2000 , 2005 ; mcclintock & remillard , 2004 ) .",
    "they are called qpos and have frequencies corresponding to orbital frequencies a few gravitational radii away from black holes .",
    "of special interest are the twin peak qpos that come in pairs of two frequencies in the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "kluniak , abramowicz ( 2000 , 2001 ) and their collaborators developed a model of twin peak qpos in terms of a non - linear resonance in epicyclic oscillations of nearly geodesic motion of matter close to the black hole ( see abramowicz 2005 for information and references ) . in this paper",
    "we extend the model by studying epicyclic oscillations of relativistic fluid tori .",
    "we prove that _ in an axially symmetric stationary spacetime , an equilibrium perfect fluid torus with small cross - section always admits global epicyclic eigenmodes of oscillations_. in newtonian theory , the same was proved recently by blaes & al .",
    "we follow closely their method , adapting it to general relativity .",
    "we start with a short reminder of how to construct an equilibrium model of the torus ( after abramowicz & al . , 1978 ) .",
    "the line element of a stationary , axially symmetric spacetime is given in the spherical coordinates @xmath1 by @xmath2 we use the @xmath3 signature .",
    "the metric coefficients depend on @xmath4 and @xmath5 , but not on @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and for this reason it is convenient to introduce two killing vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "note that , obviously , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "we assume in addition , reflection symmetry , i.e. that all odd @xmath13-derivatives of the metric coefficients vanish in the symmetry plane @xmath14 .",
    "we start by briefly recalling some known results ( see e.g. wald , 1984 ) concerning circular orbits and circular geodesics .",
    "a circular orbit is given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the angular velocity , and @xmath17 .",
    "the conserved energy and angular momentum are given by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the conserved specific angular momentum by @xmath20 .",
    "the acceleration at the circular orbit is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the effective potential .",
    "the _ geodesic circle _ is defined by the condition @xmath23 .",
    "radial @xmath24 and vertical @xmath25 epicyclic frequencies for circular geodesics around black holes have been derived first by kato & fukue ( 1980 ) , see also silbergleit & al .",
    "they may be expressed in terms of the second derivatives of the effective potential ( wald 1984 , abramowicz & kluniak 2002 ) , @xmath26 these are frequencies measured by an observer at infinity .",
    "note that these expressions are invariant  independent of the choice of metric signature and coordinates .",
    "the torus is made of perfect fluid with stress - energy tensor @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the energy density and pressure of the flow .",
    "the energy density consists of rest mass density @xmath30 and thermodynamic internal energy density @xmath31 .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the conservation law @xmath32 .",
    "projection of this into the 3-space perpendicular to the 4-velocity , together with the 4-acceleration formula ( [ equ : acceleration ] ) , gives @xmath33 from ( [ eq : releuler2 ] ) it follows that the pressure maximum @xmath34 is a geodesic circle @xmath35 and lies in the equatorial plane @xmath36 .",
    "we shall call this circle the torus center and indicate by subscript 0 quantities evaluated there ; in particular @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the energy and specific angular momentum at the torus center .      for a barotropic fluid @xmath39 ,",
    "the left hand side of this equation is a gradient of a scalar function .",
    "thus , the right hand side must also be a gradient of a scalar function .",
    "we denote it by @xmath40 .",
    "obviously , both sides of equation ( [ eq : releuler2 ] ) are gradients in the particular case of a relativistic polytrope ( which we now assume ) , i.e. when @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in this case",

    "the approximation used in ( [ equ30 ] ) is obviously correct for slender tori .",
    "it is interesting to note that slender tori with constant angular momentum distributions @xmath67 have elliptical cross - sections with semiaxes in the ratio of the epicyclic frequencies .",
    "the same is valid for newtonian slender tori ( blaes & al . , 2005 ) .",
    "in the particular case of the newtonian @xmath68 gravitational potential , @xmath69 and slender tori have exactly circular cross - section ( madej & paczyski , 1977 ) .",
    "we consider small perturbations around the stationary and axially symmetric equilibrium of the torus ( slender or not ) , in the form @xmath70 . the equation that governs these perturbations",
    "was derived in newtonian theory by papaloizou & pringle ( 1984 ) in terms of a single quantity @xmath71 .",
    "its general relativistic version has the form @xmath72 for simplicity we assume for now that the fluid angular momentum @xmath73 .",
    "we also assume that the flow is potential in the sense that @xmath74 where @xmath75 is some scalar field .",
    "linearizing this equation along with the normalization of the four - velocity , we find that @xmath76 , so that @xmath77.\\ ] ] combining these with the perturbed continuity equation , @xmath78 , @xmath79 we arrive at the relativistic version of the papaloizou - pringle equation @xmath80\\cr & -&(m^2g^{\\phi\\phi}-2m\\omega g^{t\\phi}+\\omega^2g^{tt})f^nw+ \\frac{2na^2(m\\omega-\\omega)^2}{\\beta^2a_0 ^ 2r_0 ^ 2\\omega_0 ^ 2}f^{n-1}w=0 , \\label{eq : pprel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the determinant of the metric and we used @xmath82 . in the slender torus limit @xmath83 ,",
    "this equation becomes @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "equation ( [ equ42 ] ) is identical in form with the nonrelativistic papaloizou - pringle equation for oscillations of the constant angular momentum slender torus ( cf .",
    "blaes & al . , 2005 )",
    ", so one could take advantage of feynman s reminder , _ `` the same equations have the same solutions''_. in the particular case @xmath88 the nonrelativistic papaloizou - pringle equation was _ fully solved in exact analytic form _ by blaes ( 1985 ) who gave a complete set of its eigenmodes , with a complete analytic description of all eigenfunctions and all eigenfrequencies .",
    "blaes solution can not be directly applied to the relativistic papaloizou - pringle equation ( [ equ41 ] ) , because for relativistic tori @xmath89 .",
    "more recently , blaes & al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that in the general newtonian case ( non spherically symmetric potential , @xmath90 ) , there are two particular solutions of the general papaloizou - pringle equation , @xmath91 with @xmath92 being two arbitrary constants .",
    "we claim that they are also solutions of the relativistic papaloizou - pringle equation ( [ equ42 ] ) .",
    "one may check this by a direct substitution of the solution ( [ equ43 ] ) into equation ( [ equ42 ] ) .",
    "the solution ( [ equ43 ] ) is consistent with epicyclic modes .",
    "indeed , the fluid velocity is spatially constant on the torus cross - sections , entirely radial in the case of the radial epicyclic mode @xmath93 and entirely vertical in the case of the vertical epicyclic mode @xmath94 .",
    "the radial and vertical oscillations are sinusoidal , with frequencies equal to the epicyclic frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath95 .",
    "we assumed previously that the tori had constant specific angular momentum and were isentropic .",
    "this simplifies the perturbation equations enormously by removing the local restoring forces that give rise to internal inertial modes .",
    "we now consider more general configurations , and show that global epicyclic modes are still present even here .",
    "the equilibrium of a relativistic baroclinic torus is described by equation ( [ eq : releuler2 ] ) , and the equations for axisymmetric perturbations are those of conservation of rest mass , momentum , and adiabatic flow : @xmath96 -{1\\over(-g)^{1/2}}{\\partial\\over\\partial\\theta } \\left[{(-g)^{1/2}\\rho\\delta u_\\theta\\over g_{\\theta\\theta}}\\right ] , \\label{eqrelcont } & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath97 & \\nonumber \\\\ &",

    "these equations form a closed system when we include the perturbed normalization of the four - velocity , @xmath102 and a perturbed equation of state , @xmath103 the relativistic perturbation equation for rest mass conservation can be simplified by neglecting derivatives of the metric in the slender torus limit .",
    "equation ( [ eqrelcont ] ) therefore becomes @xmath104 we now seek solutions of these equations in the slender torus limit in which @xmath105 and @xmath106 are spatially constant .",
    "equations ( [ eqrelangmom ] ) , ( [ eqreladiabat ] ) , ( [ eqdut ] ) , and ( [ eqrelcontslender ] ) then imply that @xmath107\\delta{\\bf u}\\cdot\\nabla\\ell\\right\\ } , \\label{eqdpdt1}\\ ] ] @xmath108\\delta{\\bf u}\\cdot\\nabla\\ell\\right\\ } , & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath109}\\delta{\\bf u}\\cdot\\nabla p-\\mathcal{e}^2 \\delta{\\bf u}\\cdot\\nabla\\ell\\right\\ } , & \\label{eqduphidt1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 now , in the slender torus limit , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 are all very small .",
    "gradients in pressure and density also scale as one over the small thickness of the torus .",
    "hence @xmath114 and equations ( [ eqdpdt1])-([eqduphidt1 ] ) reduce to @xmath115 @xmath116 and @xmath117    differentiating equation ( [ eqrelmom ] ) with respect to time , and using equations ( [ eqde ] ) and ( [ eqdpdt2])-([eqduphidt2 ] ) to eliminate @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , we obtain @xmath123-{1\\over u^t}{\\partial u^t\\over\\partial x^i } \\delta{\\bf u}\\cdot{\\nabla p\\over e+p}\\cr & & + u^t\\mathcal{e}^3(\\delta{\\bf u}\\cdot\\nabla\\ell ) \\left[\\omega(g^{tt}_{,i}-\\ell g^{t\\phi}_{,i})- g^{t\\phi}_{,i}+\\ell g^{\\phi\\phi}_{,i}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eqdu2first}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term on the right hand side of this equation is negligible compared to the others in the slender torus limit . using the fact that the four - acceleration vanishes at the pressure maximum , the following relationships are true in the slender torus limit : @xmath124 @xmath125 and @xmath126 hence equation ( [ eqdu2first ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath127 + { 1\\over2}g^{tt}_{,i}\\delta{\\bf u}\\cdot\\nabla({\\cal e}^2-{\\cal e}_0 ^ 2)\\cr & & -g^{t\\phi}_{,i}\\delta{\\bf u}\\cdot\\nabla({\\cal e}^2\\ell-{\\cal e}_0 ^ 2\\ell_0 ) + { 1\\over2}g^{\\phi\\phi}_{,i}\\delta{\\bf u}\\cdot\\nabla({\\cal e}^2\\ell^2- { \\cal e}_0 ^ 2\\ell_0 ^ 2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the slender torus limit , the metric derivatives may be absorbed inside the gradients , so that @xmath128\\cr & \\nonumber \\\\ & = -{1\\over2}{\\cal e}_0 ^ 2\\delta{\\bf u}\\cdot\\nabla(\\nabla { \\cal u})|_0 , & \\label{eqrelharmonic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality comes from the equilibrium equation ( [ eq : releuler2 ] ) . comparing equation ( [ eqrelharmonic ] ) with equation ( [ eq : epicycliceffective ] )",
    ", we see that we once again have radial and vertical modes which oscillate at the respective relativistic epicyclic frequencies .",
    "we have shown that the equations of motion of a fluid slender torus in axially symmetric , stationary spacetimes admit small oscillations occuring at the epicyclic frequencies . ) in the spacetime ( [ equ04 ] ) reduces to two uncoupled epicyclic oscillations with frequencies ( [ eq : epicycliceffective ] ) .",
    "global oscillations of fluids can have frequencies slightly different from the geodesic epicyclic frequencies , as equation ( [ equ44 ] ) shows for nonslender tori .",
    "see also biesiada 2003 , colistete , leygnac & kerner 2002 , and kerner , van  holten & colistete , 2001 . ] for an initially axisymmetric torus , these two oscillations are exact solutions of the fluid perturbation equations in the limit of vanishing sound speed ( when compared to the orbital frequency ) , and therefore represent two modes of oscillation of a slender torus .",
    "one of these modes corresponds to a uniform vertical displacement of the torus at the vertical epicyclic frequency , the other to a purely radial motion at the radial epicyclic frequency .    in this paper ( paper ii )",

    "the two epicyclic modes are uncoupled and independent . in reality",
    ", non - linear terms would inevitably couple the two modes . in the other papers of this series",
    "we discuss how the coupling leads naturally to the @xmath0 resonance . because the @xmath0 resonance is the main motivation for the whole series , we summarize here an idea as to how the resonance is excited and why the ratio @xmath0 is a natural consequence of strong gravity .    for newtonian slender tori , paper iii shows that ( slightly ) away from the exact slender torus limit @xmath129 ( which corresponds to @xmath130 )",

    ", the same result was derived from very general arguments , but without the specific form of @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in paper",
    "i we also argued that the presence of @xmath135 in both frequencies provides a pressure coupling between these two modes and that , accordingly , one may consider the vertical mode as being described by the mathieu type equation , @xmath136\\delta \\theta = 0,\\ ] ]    it is well known that a parametric resonance occurs when @xmath137 for black holes , @xmath138 , and therefore the smallest value of @xmath134 consistent with the resonance is @xmath139 ( paper i ) , which corresponds to the @xmath0 ratio of the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig04 ] , along with a few other possible rational ratios of the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies .    the radius ( and frequency )",
    "at which the @xmath0 resonance occurs depends on the black hole spin @xmath140 .",
