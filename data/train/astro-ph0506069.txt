    "the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellites of the galaxy provide an important test of dark matter dynamics .",
    "simulations of heirarchical merging indicate that dwarf galaxies were the first structures to form in the early universe , and the merging and accretion of these objects created the galaxies and clusters of galaxies which exist today .",
    "it is the collapse of dark matter which has driven the development of large - scale structure .",
    "observations indicate that the local dsph galaxies are potent repositories of dark matter ( see @xcite and references therein ) where the luminous material resides at the centre of a large dark halo . however , these measurements of mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath5 ) assume the system is in virial equilibrium .",
    "@xcite proposed that the interaction of a satellite within the tidal field of its host galaxy may result in an artificially inflated estimate of the virial mass .",
    "however , the simulations of @xcite imply that the central mass - to - light ratio is not substantially affected by tidal forces .",
    "in contrast , @xcite and @xcite have created models of satellite systems _ without _ dark matter yet with apparently similar characteristics to those observed in the galactic satellites .",
    "thus , tidal disruption by the milky way may be producing the appearance of dark matter in dsph galaxies .",
    "the subsequent analysis of the draco dsph by @xcite did not detect the predicted line - of - sight depth in this system , however a quantitative measurement of the gravitational influence of the galaxy on its satellites is yet to be achieved .",
    "consequently , there have been attempts to detect evidence of interactions between large galaxies and their satellites in the nearby universe .",
    "perhaps the best example of this process is the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) , a satellite currently being torn apart by the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "the simulations of @xcite have reproduced the general appearance of this disrupted system , and they find it is on a highly eccentric polar orbit ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "however , the structure of a satellite during the initial interaction with its host is still not understood .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite predict that during the early phase of interaction with the galaxy , energy is injected into the outer regions of the satellite , resulting in a slightly inflated structure .",
    "also , depending on the level of interaction , the internal structure may be distorted .",
    "an example of this initial stage may be the ursa minor dsph , which has a structure that displays significant asymmetries and extra - tidal stars @xcite .",
    "the sculptor dsph ( scl ) lies at a galactocentric distance of 80 kpc @xcite .",
    "previous studies have attempted to detect the initial stage of galaxy - satellite interaction by examining the radial profile of the sculptor system .",
    "for example , wide - field photometric surveys in a single colour @xcite have identified possible substructure and found evidence for extra - tidal stars in this dsph . indeed ,",
    "@xcite claim the possible detection of tidal tails aligned with the scl major axis .",
    "however , the effect of foreground and background sources becomes important in the outer regions of this system due to the relatively small number of scl stars compared to foreground galactic stars .",
    "as such , the existing radial profiles are highly uncertain in the outer regions , and it has therefore been difficult to accurately measure any possible inflation of the dsph structure . without a clear understanding of the level of milky way - scl interaction , and hence whether this system is in virial equilibrium , it is not possible to accurately constrain the amount of dark matter in scl using traditional velocity dispersion measurements . radial velocity studies by @xcite and @xcite of k giants found a central mass - to - light ratio of @xmath7 .",
    "if the system is undergoing substantial distortion due to the galactic tidal field , then this mass - to - light ratio may be overestimated .",
    "we have searched the sculptor dsph for structural and kinematic distortion .",
    "firstly , we collected wide - field photometry in two colours covering a 10 deg@xmath3 area centred on scl , well beyond the nominal tidal radius of this galaxy .",
    "the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) obtained from the inner parts of the system was used to select candidate scl stars over the dataset area , thereby increasing their contrast relative to field sources in the outer parts . for examples of this process ,",
    "see the analyses by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in the second stage , we have obtained spectra for @xmath8700 of the brightest candidate members .",
    "this allowed a further refinement of the dataset by selecting stars based on radial velocity and metal abundances .",
    "this paper describes our search for substructure in sculptor based on the combined photometric / spectroscopic dataset .",
    "a companion paper ( @xcite ; hereafter c05 ) presents the results for a similar wide - field photometric survey of fornax .",
    "the observational strategy for this system followed that of the fornax dsph ( c05 ) .",
    "images of the sculptor region were obtained at the siding spring observatory 1 metre telescope equipped with the wide field imager ( wfi ) .",
    "sixteen fields were observed in two filters ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , thereby covering a @xmath11 area on the sky using a @xmath12 mosaic of wfi fields .",
    "similar to the fornax observations , accurate photometry was required to magnitudes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , encompassing the range of the sculptor red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "a full list of observations , including the atmospheric seeing , is given in table [ sculptorobservations ] .",
    "the data were reduced using the iraf program , and the stellar magnitudes were measured using the daophot program within iraf .",
    "an astrometric calibration of this dataset was made using the ucac1 catalogue @xcite .",
    "a full description of the data reduction and photometric calibration techniques can be found in c05 .",
    "multiply - detected stars in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 maps were removed by matching sources in the overlap regions with a search radius of @xmath13 .",
    "the same search algorithm was used to combine the @xmath9 and @xmath10 datasets , thus producing a @xmath14 colour for all stars in common between the two maps .",
    "[ sclcmd_cand ] shows the resulting cmd from the region within @xmath15 of the centre of sculptor . to measure the photometric completeness of the survey , a luminosity function was generated for each of the sixteen sculptor fields in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands",
    "we then assumed the completeness limit of each field to be 0.2 mag brighter than the turnover in the luminosity function . to ensure this method",
    "provided an accurate measurement of the completeness limit , we created a dataset of @xmath85000 artificial stars with a distribution resembling the scl rgb .",
    "these stars were placed in each field , and then recovered using the photometry routines described above .",
    "it was found that @xmath16 to @xmath17 of the artificial stars were recovered from each field to their respective photometry limits .",
    "thus , the luminosity function allowed an adequate measurement of the photometric limit for each field .",
    "the overall magnitude limit of the survey is then defined by the field with the least depth : field scl5 which is complete to @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the 2df instrument at the prime focus of the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) allows the simultaneous spectroscopy of up to 400 targets over a field of view @xmath18 in diameter .",
    "a full description of 2df is given by @xcite .",
    "our aim was to collect spectra at 850 nm for candidate scl stars , and to use the ca ii triplet spectral features to the separate scl members ( the ` signal ' ) from foreground / background sources ( the ` noise ' ) .",
    "we chose 1408 candidate scl stars from the photometric survey ( described in the previous section ) using the cmd selection range displayed in fig .",
    "[ sclcmd_cand ] .",
    "spectra were obtained for 893 of these candidates , however only 764 yielded spectra with the required signal - to - noise . the majority of the stars for which spectra were not obtained lie close to , or within , three core radii , where the limit on fibre - to - fibre spacing of 2df restricts the object selection .",
    "for the 527 stars in the sample beyond the tidal radius , however , @xmath19 have acceptable spectra .",
    "the faint limit of this spectroscopic survey was set to be @xmath20 ( approximately @xmath21 at the colour of the rgb , well above the photometric completeness limit given in the previous section ) thus sampling the upper 2.0 mag of the scl rgb .",
    "the spatial distribution of these stars is shown in fig .",
    "[ sclxy_cand ] , where the five dashed circles outline the observed 2df fields .",
    "note that we have observed potential member stars well beyond the scl nominal tidal radius .",
    "approximately 100 stars located in the overlap regions between 2df fields were observed more than once to ensure we obtained consistent velocities and ca ii line strengths .",
    "the selected stars were observed with the 1200r gratings , and the resulting spectra were centred near the ca ii ir triplet with a wavelength range of @xmath22   and a scale of 1.07  per pixel .",
    "although the red spectral region is dominated by sky emission lines , we reduced such contamination using the slow - beam switching method , which intersperses object exposures with offset sky frames containing the same fibre configuration ; that is , object and sky were observed through the same fibre .",
    "in addition , each configuration included 42 fibres assigned to sky positions .",
    "hence , the observation sequence for each scl field consisted of @xmath23min exposures and three offset sky images .",
    "each sequence also included three wavelength calibration frames ( arcs ) comprising four cu - ar and two cu - he lamps with an exposure time of 30s .",
    "an arc frame at the start , middle and end of the sequence accounted for possible instrumental wavelength shifts . approximately @xmath24 hours were required to completely observe each field .",
    "a list of observations is given in table [ 2dfobs ] .",
    "we also obtained spectra for 16 and 13 red giants in the globular clusters ngc 1904 and ngc 2298 respectively to be used as radial velocity standard stars .",
    "additionally , the metallicities of these clusters ( ngc 1904 , [ fe / h]@xmath25 ; ngc 2298 , [ fe / h]@xmath26 ; from @xcite ) are approximately equal to that of scl ( @xmath27 [ fe / h ] @xmath28 ; @xcite ) . for old , metal poor stars ( such as those in scl and the globular clusters )",
    "the individual equivalent widths of the calcium lines can be related to the metal abundance , and we can use the globular cluster observations to calibrate this relation .",
    "thus , additional to selecting stars based on radial velocity , the ca ii line strengths provided a second constraint to select members of the scl system .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the 2dfdr program in an interactive mode . in the 2df setup",
    ", 400 spectra are divided between two ccds , including 21 sky fibres per ccd .",
    "as a first step in the data reduction process , a tram - line map was generated for both ccds .",
    "this map tracked the output spectra on each ccd , and was obtained from the fibre flat field images due to their high s / n .",
    "the tram line map was then shifted and rotated to fit each individual data frame and the signal for each fibre extracted .",
    "the arc frames then provide a wavelength calibration for each fibre by matching the pixel position of the observed lines with the spectral line list .",
    "an accurate sky subtraction is dependent on a reliable fibre throughput calibration , since the relative throughputs of individual fibres can vary by @xmath8@xmath29 .",
    "the offset sky exposures were used to measure the relative fibre throughput .",
    "these were taken with the same configuration as the object field , and multiple offset sky exposures at dithered positions ensured each fibre was accurately sampling the sky .",
    "the offset sky frames were median combined to ensure the sky spectrum was not accidentally contaminated by sources or cosmic rays .",
    "the scl frames were then reduced and fit - extracted , and the combined sky spectrum ( from the 21 sky fibres ) , scaled by the individual fibre throughputs , was subtracted to remove the night - sky features .",
    "the six exposures for each field were then median - combined to produce the final set of spectra .      due to",
    "less than favourable observing conditions ( seeing @xmath30 ) , only 14 of the 29 globular cluster ( gc ) stars in the observed configurations had spectra with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio to be used as radial velocity standard stars .",
    "six of these were recorded on ccd 1 and eight on ccd 2 . to ensure these spectra were adequate templates",
    ", we used them to independently measure the mean systematic velocity of the two clusters , which were then compared to the known values .",
    "the stellar radial velocities were measured using the _ rvidlines _ routine in iraf .",
    "each velocity was calculated as the mean value determined from the three ca ii lines .",
    "these were corrected for the motion of the earth and we removed the ccd - dependence of these velocities using the @xmath31 values determined below .",
    "thus , we calculated a mean radial velocity of @xmath32 km s@xmath33 for ngc 1904 ( from six stars ) and @xmath34 km s@xmath33 for ngc 2298 ( from seven stars , after removing a star whose radial velocity of 71 km s@xmath33 indicated it is not a cluster member ) where the errors are the standard deviation of the mean . these compare well to the values listed in the online globular cluster catalogue ( @xcite ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 km s@xmath33 respectively ) .    in order to use these spectra as radial velocity standard spectra , we first needed to measure the velocity offset between each gc star .",
    "for each ccd , the star with the highest s / n spectrum was defined to be the master star , and the remaining gc spectra were cross - correlated with the master spectrum to measure velocity offsets .",
    "this resulted in six ( eight ) template spectra on ccd 1 ( ccd 2 ) with a known velocity offset from the master star .",
    "radial velocities for the candidate scl stars were then measured by cross - correlating the spectrum with all templates from the appropriate ccd , and shifting the resulting velocity by the appropriate offset such that they were measured relative to the master star for that ccd .",
    "the spectra were cross - correlated in the wavelength range @xmath37  , which encompasses the ca ii triplet lines ( @xmath388498 , @xmath388542 and @xmath388662  ) and reduces the number of strong sky features which may not have been completely removed from the stellar spectra ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "this was accomplished using the _ fxcor _ routine in the iraf radial velocity package .",
    "consequently , each star whose spectrum was recorded on ccd 1 ( ccd 2 ) was cross - correlated with six ( eight ) gc spectra , resulting in multiple radial velocity measurements .",
    "since the velocities of the candidate scl stars were measured relative to the two master stars , an adjustment was required to transform these to heliocentric velocities .",
    "the heliocentric velocities of both master stars were previously measured using the _ rvidlines _ routine as described above . also , we calculated the heliocentric conversion for the scl frames .",
    "the difference between these values was added to the velocities of the candidate sculptor stars , resulting in a set of radial velocity measurements relative to the sun .",
    "we combined these values to give a mean radial velocity for each potetial scl member , and the velocity uncertainty was calculated as the standard deviation from the mean .",
    "a final velocity zeropoint shift was achieved by comparing our measured radial velocities with those in a previous catalogue , which includes the observations of @xcite .",
    "high resolution spectra for 38 stars were recorded over three seasons ( @xmath39 ) at the ctio 4 metre telescope , where the stars were selected from the @xcite and @xcite photographic surveys of scl .",
    "@xcite described the data reduction and velocity measurement techniques and estimated the radial velocities had a mean error of @xmath84 km s@xmath33 .",
    "the current survey included 27 stars in common with this catalogue , where 14 spectra were recorded on ccd 1 and 13 on ccd 2 .",
    "from these , the mean velocity difference between this program and the @xcite catalogue was found to be , @xmath40 where the errors are the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "these @xmath31 values were added to the measured velocities to produce a final radial velocity for 764 stars .    to determine the mean uncertainty of the scl radial velocities",
    ", we compared the measurements for multiply observed stars . during the 2df observing run",
    ", multiple observations were obtained of 120 stars located in the overlap regions between 2df fields .",
    "of these stars , 92 yielded multiple radial velocities with an uncertainty less than 20 km s@xmath33 , and these cover the full magnitude range of the survey .",
    "approximately 60 of these were observed on both ccds , and over half were obtained with significantly different fibre numbers .",
    "this allowed cross - ccd comparisons between spectra recorded at different positions in each ccd .",
    "the ccd velocity corrections listed above were applied to these values , and a comparison of these multiple observations yielded a mean velocity difference of @xmath41 km s@xmath33 , with a standard deviation of @xmath42 km s@xmath33 .",
    "thus , dividing this value by @xmath43 , the scl velocities have a mean uncertainty of approximately 10 km s@xmath33 .",
    "some of the measured velocities contained a large uncertainty , hence those with a velocity error greater than 20 km s@xmath33 were removed .",
    "this criterion removed 41 stars , resulting in a final catalogue containing 723 candidate scl stars .",
    "the majority of the rejected stars were located towards the faint end of the 2df survey limit , where the mean velocity uncertainty was found to be @xmath812 km s@xmath33 , as compared with @xmath82 km s@xmath33 at the bright end of the survey .",
    "[ sclxy_cand ] shows the spatial distribution of the final catalogue 723 stars .",
    "the lines comprising the ca ii triplet are the strongest features in the far red component of a stellar spectrum , and are also situated close to the peak of the spectral energy distribution displayed by red giant stars .",
    "therefore , the pseudo - equivalent widths , or line strengths , of these three lines ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) in rgb stars can be easily measured by medium - resolution spectroscopy . a detailed description of the calcium triplet lines and their relation to red giant metallicities is given by @xcite .",
    "@xcite first noted that if @xmath47 is plotted against @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the magnitude of the horizontal branch ) for several stars in numerous globular clusters , then the resulting slopes are independent of cluster abundance .",
    "this relation has been further investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to fig .  2 in @xcite",
    ", whose study of several galactic globular clusters demonstrated that the best fitting line for the @xmath50 relation has a slope of @xmath51  / mag .",
    "consequently , this linear relationship can be used to remove the dependence of line strength on surface gravity by defining the reduced equivalent width to be @xmath52 .",
    "an important feature of @xmath53 is that it can be directly related to the iron abundance @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed several galactic globular clusters with a large abundance range and demonstrated that the @xmath53-[fe / h ] relation can be split into two linear regimes .",
    "this relation was further investigated by @xcite , who found a similar result ( albeit with a slightly different definition of the reduced equivalent width ) using data for 52 galactic globular clusters .",
    "therefore , the strengths of the ca ii lines provide an independent measure of metallicity for old , metal - poor stars .    in this survey , equivalent widths of the ca ii lines at @xmath388452 and @xmath388662   were measured using the method described by @xcite .",
    "two windows to either side of each feature were used to trace the continuum at the feature wavelength .",
    "the equivalent widths were then measured using a gaussian fitting technique .",
    "the same rest wavelength windows given in table 2 of @xcite were used to fit the gaussian functions and continuum line , however for the blue continuum bandpass of the ca ii @xmath54 line we used the wavelength range @xmath55  .",
    "the weakest of the ca ii triplet lines , centred at a rest wavelength of @xmath388498  , generally does not have sufficient s / n in our spectra , especially at low metallicities , for accurate measurement of the equivalent width .",
    "hence this line was not included in the following line strength analysis .",
    "[ ewgc](a ) shows the sum of the two strongest ca ii line strengths as a function of magnitude difference from the horizontal branch for the two globular clusters ngc 1904 ( closed circles ) and ngc 2298 ( open circles ) .",
    "we have discounted one of the stars in the ngc 2298 dataset , since its velocity and equivalent width data indicate it is not a member of the cluster .",
    "also , two of the stars have been removed from the set of ngc 1904 points , as their @xmath56 values contained large uncertainties and differed significantly from the remaining four stars .",

    "[ ewgc](a ) trace the best linear fit to the data with a slope of @xmath51  / mag .",

    ", we find their @xmath57 values for the clusters ngc 1904 and 2298 to be @xmath58 and @xmath59   respectively .",
    "we calculated @xmath53 for each star using the data shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ ewgc ] , and found the following mean reduced equivalent width for each cluster , @xmath60 where the uncertainties are the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "these are consistent with the @xcite values .",
    "a second verification of these reduced equivalent widths was to ensure they satisfy the empirical @xmath57-[fe / h ] relation derived by @xcite using the globular cluster metallicities provided by @xcite .",

    "[ ewgc](b ) illustrates this relationship for metal - poor clusters , and the two data points represent the @xmath57 values listed above .",
    "the [ fe / h ] values are from @xcite , to ensure consistency with the @xcite  study .",
    "the datapoints are adequately described by the abundance relation , hence the mean reduced equivalent widths derived for these two globular clusters are consistent with previous observations .",
    "the overall uncertainty of the line strength measurements was obtained by comparing 71 multiply observed stars in the overlap regions between 2df fields that have the same approximate luminosity distribution as the total set of scl candidates . for the @xmath45 and @xmath46 lines",
    ", we measured the standard deviation from the mean to be 0.31   and 0.38   respectively .",
    "the total uncertainty for @xmath56 was measured to be @xmath61  .",
    "this uncertainty is dominated by instrumental and sky noise , and is only weakly dependent on magnitude .",
    "the early photographic studies of @xcite established many of the fundamental structural parameters of scl , and did not detect any significant deviations from a smooth stellar density profile .",
    "however , later analyses @xcite found that the region within the core radius is almost circular , yet the ellipticity increases with radius . these analyses also detected possible extra - tidal stars .",
    "more recently , @xcite conducted a structural analysis of scl based on a ` blue ' ( iiiaj ) photographic plate , and found that its structure closely resembles the numerical simulations of tidally distorted galaxies by @xcite .",
    "irwin & hatzidimitriou also found some evidence for extra - tidal stars .",
    "the ccd survey of @xcite detected possible tidal tails extending along the major axis of scl in the east - west direction and concluded that the outer structure of scl is strongly influenced by the galactic tidal field .",
    "consequently , to further address these claims , we have investigated the structure of scl using a variety of methods applied to the photometric dataset .",
    "the cmd provides a filter to select candidate scl stars , thereby decreasing the number of field stars . in a similar photometric survey of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy",
    ", we described a simple colour - magnitude selection technique which decreased contamination due to field stars ( c05 ) .",
    "for the scl survey we applied a more complex cmd - selection process based on that of @xcite , which has since been adapted by @xcite .",
    "this method required the cmd to be divided into an array of cells , and provided a ` signal ' value of scl stars throughout colour - magnitude space . those cells with a signal greater than the limiting value",
    "were then used to select candidate scl stars , maximising the ratio of scl to field stars in the outer regions of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "a full description can be found in @xcite , however we include a summary of the process below , detailing how it was applied to our data .    to determine the signal of scl stars over the cmd",
    ", we divided the photometric data into two spatial regions ; the ` core ' region ( within three core radii of the scl centre ) , which is dominated by scl stars ; and the field star region ( located outside the tidal radius and within the survey limit ) .",
    "a grid was overlaid on the cmd , subdividing it into a series of cells with indices @xmath62 .",
    "each cell had a width of 0.05 mag in colour and a height of 0.10 mag . to minimise the effects of photometry errors",
    ", we only considered the magnitude range @xmath63 , where the mean colour uncertainty is less than 0.03 mag . for each colour - magnitude cell @xmath62 , we counted the number of stars located in the core region @xmath64 , and the number in the field region @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the signal - to - noise ratio of core to field stars for each cmd cell is , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ratio of the core area to the field star area . in effect , the array @xmath68 listed which regions of the cmd contained a high signal - to - noise of sculptor stars . following the method of @xcite , we defined a limiting signal value @xmath69 to optimise the cumulative signal - to - noise ratio of core stars to field stars .",
    "stars were then selected in those cmd cells with a signal greater than a limiting signal value : @xmath70 . a contour plot showing the signal @xmath68 over colour - magnitude space is given in fig .  [ sclcmdlines ] .",
    "the outer contour outlines those cells with a signal greater than @xmath69 .",
    "this region encompasses the scl rgb down to the photometric limit , and hence was used to select candidate rgb stars .",
    "thus , we selected 4355 candidate scl rgb stars , and the spatial distribution is displayed in fig .",

    "consequently , we fitted a king profile to the inner @xmath74 , which is represented by a dotted line .",
    "this profile had a limiting radius of @xmath75 arcmin , and the data shown in fig .",
    "[ sclradial ] implies significant ` extra - tidal ' structure .",

    "we have found that an over - subtraction of the field population in our data can reproduce the results of @xcite , giving a detection of extra - tidal structure .",
    "it is clear that neither model provides an adequate description of the sculptor system , however the king parameters for both models are listed in table [ kingpar ] , where the entries for ` rgb - a ' refer to the profile for the inner @xmath74 of scl .    in this context , it is worth considering the results of @xcite , who found that the red giants of sculptor apparently consist of two populations which are kinematically and chemically distinct .",
    "these two populations are probably related to the fact that the red and blue hb stars in sculptor have different radial distributions with the red hb stars being more centrally concentrated @xcite .",
    "section 4.3 contains a full analysis of the blue and red hb star distributions , from which we have derived their spatial extents ; the king parameters for both populations are given in table [ kingpar ] .",
    "we have used these distributions to examine the overall density profile of the rgb stars , finding that a two - component fit gives an excellent representation of the data .",

    "these two components have the core and limiting radii listed for the blue and red hb populations respectively .",

    "the resulting model provides a significantly better fit to the data than a single component model .        in the companion paper ( c05 )",
    "we described two methods to detect structure beyond the nominal tidal radius of a stellar system .",

    ", we were able to find the probability of measuring a given density of stars _ outside _ the nominal tidal radius .",
    "a uniform distribution of stars ( for example , the field star population ) is expected to display a gaussian density function , while substructure will produce a non - gaussian function .",
    "this function was measured for the distribution of rgb - selected stars outside the nominal tidal radius of scl , where the stellar density was measured within @xmath77 circles of radius @xmath78 .",

    "2 ) we find @xmath8@xmath173 of these are located beyond the nominal tidal radius of the rgb population determined in the current study , @xmath174 .",
    "that is , only @xmath175 of these stars are extra - tidal .",
    "this result agrees with our upper mass limit for extra - tidal structure stated above .",
    "although there is little evidence of significant extra - tidal structure in our spectroscopic sample , it is worth refering to the work of @xcite , who measured the absolute proper motion of scl to be towards the north - east .",
    "four of the seven extra - tidal stars we have identified are located in this quadrant .",
    "if these stars are members of sculptor , then they would represent leading tidal material .",
    "it is difficult , however , to make any definite statement in this regard based on such a small dataset .",
    "also , there is no correlating north - east population of extra - tidal stars in the @xcite analysis .",
    "we have conducted a combined photometric and spectroscopic survey of the scl dsph to determine if its structure and kinematics have been influenced by the tidal field of the galaxy . in the first phase of the survey",
    ", we obtained photometry in two colours ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) over a 10 deg@xmath3 area centred on scl .",
    "the dataset was complete to a magnitude of @xmath0 , encompassing the scl red giant branch .",
    "stars were selected in the rgb colour - magnitude range , thereby increasing the contrast of scl stars to the foreground galactic population .",
    "the sculptor structure appears to follow a two - component model , where each component is represented by the blue and red horizontal branch stars respectively .",
    "although there was no obvious extra - tidal structure , we determined that up to @xmath29 of the light from scl could be outside the tidal radius and still evade photometric detection .",
    "hence , to further probe the scl extra - tidal region , we obtained far red spectra for over 700 stars located in the upper - rgb region of the scl cmd .",
    "stars were selected as scl members based on three criteria : radial velocity , ca ii triplet strength , and proper motion .",
    "the final scl member list contained 148 stars , with seven located outside the tidal radius .",
    "thus , if scl does possess extra - tidal structure , then it makes up less than @xmath4 of the luminous mass in this system .",
    "therefore , we have found little sign of tidal interaction between sculptor and the galaxy .",
    "this lack of tidal interaction makes it highly likely that velocity dispersion studies do provide a true measure of the dark matter mass of this dsph .",
