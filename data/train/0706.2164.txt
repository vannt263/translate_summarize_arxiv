    "given that the ce01 and dh02 models give similar expected @xmath3 ratios for sources with @xmath197  at @xmath83 ( figure  [ fig : f70f24_ref ] ) , we expect similar results between these models for the faint sources . at higher 24  flux densities ,",

    "we study the implications the stacking results have for the total ir luminosities and the sfrs for individual 24  detected galaxies at high redshifts . to illustrate this , we compute the total ir luminosities for all the @xmath4 galaxies with @xmath126  using two methods .",

    "unsurprisingly , figure  [ fig : sfrvsfr ] illustrates that objects with large bolometric luminosities  and thus large sfrs  inferred from their 24  flux densities are reduced substantially when we include the average 70 and 160  flux densities from the stacking analysis . as a result , some published studies using the inferred sfrs and  for bright 24  selected objects at @xmath23 deserve reexamination . several studies using data covering relatively small areas ( @xmath20100160  arcmin@xmath39 ) found that sources at @xmath23 have average 24  flux densities , @xmath176100200  @xcite . at these flux densities",
    "our analysis shows that @xmath193 and @xmath192 are comparable ( within a factor 2 for the dh02 models ) , and the average 70 and 160  emission will have little influence on the conclusions of these studies .",
    "in contrast , studies of 24  sources at @xmath23 over relatively larger areas identify many more bright 24  sources , where the average 70 and 160  sources have the most affect .",
    "for example , @xcite find that the characteristic luminosity of the total ir luminosity function at @xmath83 is @xmath223  ( applying their scaling to the monochromatic rest ",
    "frame 12  luminosity ) , corresponding to @xmath224  .",
    "our findings imply that ir luminosities of sources as bright or brighter than the `` knee '' in this luminosity function will be overestimated by factors of @xmath762 ( or greater than a factor of four using the sk07 models ) .",

    "the total ir luminosities of these sources will be overestimated by factors @xmath763 ( and possibly as large as an order of magnitude ) using solely on the 24  flux densities and local templates for star - forming galaxies .",
    "therefore , based on our stacking analysis at 70 and 160  , the bolometric luminosities and sfrs of bright 24  galaxies at @xmath0 are more modest than what is suggested based solely on the 24  flux densities .    under the assumption that dust heating from star formation powers the ir luminosities , the 24  derived sfrs for many sources are @xmath227  yr@xmath7 , even after excluding x - ray and ir  power - law sources .",

    "thus , if a high redshift starburst consumes the available gas mass , there must be an accompanying mechanism to replenish the galaxies gas supply and drive it to high densities ( e.g. , cold  gas flows or successive galaxy mergers ) , in order to maintain the high detection fraction .",
    "logically , the reservoir of molecular gas in galaxies is substantially higher at @xmath0 than at present , and the enhanced fraction of systems with maximal sfrs is likely a consequence of the fact that more gas is available to fuel starbursts or agn .",

    "we use a two  dimensional bilinear interpolation to center the 70 and 160  subimages on the astrometric coordinates of the 24  source .",
    "we then subtract the local background measured in annuli of 3965  and 3256  of each 70 and 160  subimage , respectively .",
    "in the second step we sum the images and take the mean to derive the average flux density of the sample . following @xcite and @xcite",

    "in general , we found these to all be consistent once we removed sources detected in the 70 and 160  ( see below ) .",
    "thus , the method used to combine the subimages is secondary relative to ensuring that the subimages are clean of bright sources .",
    "we tested our stacking method using simulations of artificial sources of known flux density randomly placed in the ecdf ",
    "s 70 and 160  images . we compared the accuracy of the flux density measured in the stacked image to the true value .",

    "figure  [ fig : appendix ] shows the distribution of the ratio of the measured flux density to the true ( input ) flux density as a function of flux density and number of sources for the 70  simulations .",
    "the width of the distribution increases with decreasing 70  flux density , and decreasing number of objects each stack .",
    "we find similar behavior in the distribution for the 160  simulations .",
    "the mean of the measured  to  input flux density ratio shifts to values greater than one for low numbers of objects and fainter flux density .",
    "this is a consequence of two effects .",
    "one is that the flux from nearby detected objects bias the measured flux density .",
    "the other is a result of `` confusion noise '' from nearby unresolved sources , which contribute to the average stacked value ( and similar to effect in confusion ",
    "limited sub ",

    "2005 ) . to suppress the effect of detected sources from contributing to the stacking , we repeated our monte carlo test after first removing sources with @xmath765@xmath87 detections in the 70 and 160  images .",
    "the top right panel in figure  [ fig : appendix ] shows the distribution of measured  to  input flux values using the source  subtracted images for the 70  simulations before stacking .",
    "we found appreciable gains in the accuracy of the average value for images cleaned of sources detected in the 70 and 160  images .",
    "we derive the error , @xmath87 , on the stacking measurement using the width of the distribution of measured  to  input flux ratio .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : appendix ] illustrates the gain in signal  to  noise ( @xmath249 ) measured from the stacked images as a function of flux density and number of objects in each stack .",
    "for example , for an average measurement of 100 simulated objects with @xmath250  mjy the uncertainty is 0.42  mjy without excluding sources .",
