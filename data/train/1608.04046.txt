    "several information - centric networking ( icn ) architectures have been proposed @xcite to improve on the performance of the ip internet by enabling packet forwarding based on the names of content or services required , rather than the addresses where they may be hosted .",
    "they attempt to accomplish this by means of new ways to integrate name resolution ( mapping of names to locations ) and routing ( establishing paths between locations ) functions .",
    "section [ sec - related ] summarizes prior work on forwarding planes for icn architectures .",
    "most architectures keep name resolution and routing independent of each other , but offer major improvements over the current use of the domain name system ( dns ) to map domain names to ip addresses . by contrast , the content - centric networking ( ccnx ) @xcite and the named data networking ( ndn ) @xcite architectures _ merge _ name resolution with routing to content and services in order to allow consumers to request content objects ( co ) or services by name .",
    "routers provide this service using three tables .",
    "a content store ( cs ) lists the cos that are cached locally .",
    "a pending interest table ( pit ) keeps forwarding state for each interest ( a request for a co ) processed by a router , such that a single copy of an interest for the same co is forwarded and responses to interests can be sent over the reverse paths traversed by the interests .",
    "a forwarding information base ( fib ) listing the next hops to name prefixes is used to forward interests towards content producers .",
    "the simplicity of merging name resolution with routing is very attractive .",
    "however , it comes at a big price , in terms of storage requirements associated with fibs and pits @xcite and additional vulnerabilities to ddos attacks associated with pits @xcite .",
    "consider a network in which a name - based routing protocol establishes routes to all known name prefixes and to those routers that announce name prefixes being locally available , which we call anchors of the prefixes .",
    "section  [ sec - correct ] shows that the path traversed by an interest when routers maintain fibs with entries for name prefixes is the same as the path traversed by the interest if the first router binds the name prefix that provides the best match for the co name to the name of an anchor of that prefix , and routers forward the interest towards that anchor .",
    "section  [ sec - design ] describes ccn - ramp , which is based on two key innovations .",
    "first , ccn - ramp integrates name resolution with routing to name - prefix anchors using the name - based content routing protocol running in the control plane ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the approach takes advantage of the result presented in section  [ sec - correct ] , and",
    "the consequence is that routers can forward interests using forwarding tables that are orders of magnitude smaller than the fibs required in ndn and ccnx , and even smaller than the fibs needed in the ip internet .",
    "second , ccn - ramp extends recent results in @xcite to eliminate forwarding loops , and to replace pits with small forwarding tables listing the next hops towards the origins of interests , without identifying such origins .",
    "section  [ sec - perf ] compares the performance of ccn - ramp with ndn when either no caching or on - path caching is used in a 153-router network .",
    "ccn - ramp incurs very similar interest traffic than ndn to retrieve content , requires orders of magnitude fewer entries in forwarding tables than ndn , and needs fewer table look ups to retrieve any given co than ndn .",
    "previous work attempting to make the forwarding planes of icn architectures efficient is vast and excellent reviews exist of this prior work @xcite . we only highlight the main points regarding name resolution and routing that motivate our design . in this light",
    ", it is important to first note that a major impediment for the ip internet to provide efficient access to content and services by name is the poor interaction between name resolution and routing that it currently supports .",
    "a client must be an integral part of name resolution and is required to bind the name of the co or service to be requested to the location where the content or service is offered .",
    "a client first interacts with a local domain name system ( dns ) server to obtain the mapping of a domain name to an ip address in order for a request for content or service can be sent to a specific ip address . adding to this , the dns is based on a hierarchical , static caching structure of servers hosting the mappings of domain names to addresses built and maintained independently of routing and requiring servers to be configured on how to contact other servers over the internet .",
    "triad @xcite was one of the first projects to advocate using names for routing rather than addresses .",
    "since then , many icn architectures have been proposed that support name resolution and content routing functionality to enable consumers to ask for content objects ( co ) or services by name .",
    "these architectures differ on how a co name is mapped to a producer or source that can provide the requested co or service , and the way in which paths are established for requests for cos or services and the associated requests .",
    "some icn architectures @xcite , including dona , pursuit , sail , comet , and mobilityfirst , implement name resolution and routing as independent functions . in these architectures , name resolution servers",
    "( called by different names ) are organized hierarchically , as multi - level dhts , or along trees spanning the network @xcite , and consumers and producers contact such servers to publish and subscribe to content in various ways .",
    "consumers obtain the locations of publishers from name resolution servers , and send their content requests to those locations to get the required content or services , and address - based routing is used to establish paths between consumers and subscribers or between resolution servers and subscribers or consumers .    a major limitation of keeping name resolution independent of routing stems from the complexity incurred in keeping name - resolution servers consistent with one another , and allowing consumers and producers to interact with the name - resolution system .",
    "enabling the updates of name - to - address mapping is a non - trivial problem using hierarchical structures , spanning trees , or dht - based organizations of servers .",
    "another design consideration in these architectures is that a solution is still needed to preserve the anonymity of the sources of requests for cos or services , which may induce additional complexity in the forwarding plane or require the use of the forwarding mechanisms used in ndn and ccnx .",
    "in contrast to most prior icn architectures , ndn and ccnx _ merge _ name resolution and routing , such that routers are the facto name resolvers by establishing routes to name prefixes on a hop - by - hop basis .",
    "a major advantage of doing this is that it eliminates the complexity of designing and maintaining a network of name - resolution servers that replace the dns .",
    "this merging of functionalities is supported by : ( a ) a name - based routing protocol operating in the control plane , which updates the entries in fibs listing the next hops to known name prefixes , and ( b ) forwarding of interests based on the longest prefix match ( lpm ) between the co name in the interest and a name prefix listed in the fibs .    however , as attractive as the simplicity of merging of name resolution with routing in ndn and ccnx is , it comes at a very big price . because the name of a co or service is bound directly to a route on a hop - by - hop basis",
    ", each router along the path traversed by an interest must look up a fib listing the known name prefixes .",
    "to operate at internet scale , fib sizes in ndn are acknowledged to eventually reach billions of entries @xcite .",
    "this is easy to imagine , given that the number of registered domains in the ip internet was more than 300 million by the end of 2015 .",
    "this is orders of magnitude larger than the largest fib size for the ip internet , which is smaller than 600,000 today .    to make matters worse , the name prefixes assumed in icn architectures are variable length and much more complex than ip addresses",
    "this means that efficient lpm algorithms developed for the ip internet can not be applied directly to ndn and ccnx .",
    "indeed , it has been noted that ndn and ccnx can not be deployed at internet scale without further advances in technology @xcite .",
    "the size of a pit grows linearly with the number of distinct interests received by a router as consumers pipeline interests ( e.g. , to support hd video streams ) or request more content , or more consumers request content @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as the following paragraphs summarize , pits do not deliver substantial benefits compared to much simpler interest - forwarding mechanisms , and can actually be counter - productive .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the percentage of aggregated interests is minuscule when in - network caching is used , even interests exhibit temporal correlation .",
    "we have also shown that per - interest forwarding state is not needed to preserve the privacy of consumers issuing the interests @xcite .",
    "supporting multicast content delivery efficiently in the data plane has been viewed as a major reason to use pits . however , as we demonstrate in @xcite , maintaining per - interest forwarding state is unnecessary to implement pull - based multicast content dissemination . in a nutshell , a source - pacing algorithm can be used with routers maintaining per - source rather than per - interest forwarding state .",
    "routers forwarding traffic from a given multicast source maintain the most recent _ multicast - counter value _ ( @xmath0 ) for the source .",
    "a router forwards an interest towards a source only if the @xmath0 stated in the interest is larger than the value it currently stores for the source and discards the interest otherwise .",
    "the net effect is the same as interest aggregation , but without the large overhead of per - interest forwarding state @xcite .",
    "we have also shown @xcite that interest aggregation combined with the interest - loop detection mechanisms used in ndn and ccnx can lead to interests being aggregated while traversing forwarding loops without such loops being detected .",
    "this results in aggregated interests  waiting to infinity \" for responses that never come .",
    "in addition , using pits makes routers vulnerable to interest - flooding attacks @xcite in which malicious users can send malicious interests aimed at making the size of pits explode .",
    "unfortunately , the countermeasures that have been proposed for these attacks @xcite simply attempt to reduce the rates at which suspected routers can forward interests , and this can be used to mount other types of denial - of - service attacks .",
    "a number of proposals have been advanced to allow interest forwarding in ndn based on lpm to keep up with new wire speeds while coping with the required fib sizes and name - prefix structures .",
    "a big challenge for name - based interest forwarding is to attain 100 gbps rates or higher , given that fibs listing name prefixes at internet scale are much too large to fit into sram or tcam @xcite .",
    "several proposals for the implementation of fibs for ndn rely on the use of tries and massive parallelism in order to avoid bottlenecks in the encoding process needed to use the tries @xcite .",
    "other approaches are based on hash tables for fib lookups @xcite , which requires larger memory footprints and is not scalable to prefix names with a large number of name components .",
    "hash - based approaches for name - based forwarding are based on dram technology and rely on massive parallel processing , because they would require hundreds of mibs for just a few million prefixes .    given the major limitations of using lpm in fibs containing billions of name prefixes , a few proposals have been advanced to either reduce the size of fibs listing name prefixes or eliminate the use of such fibs .",
    "song et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of  speculative forwarding \" based on longest - prefix classification ( lpc ) rather than lpm .",
    "lpc behaves just like lpm when a match is found in the fib for the name stated in an interest ; however , with lpc a packet is forwarded to a next hop given by the fib even if no match is found .",
    "unfortunately , as described in @xcite , interests may be forwarded along loops .",
    "although the ndn forwarding strategy can prevent interests from traversing the same forwarding loop multiple times , it can not guarantee that interests will not be aggregated while they traverse forwarding loops @xcite .",
    "snamp @xcite and panini @xcite reduce fib sizes by means of default routes and default - free zones .",
    "edge routers resolve and keep track of local name prefixes , and forward all other interests toward backbone routers that create a default - free zone and map name prefixes to globally - routed names .",
    "tagnet @xcite uses content descriptors and host locators for forwarding .",
    "content descriptors are variable - length sets represented with fixed - length bloom filters for forwarding .",
    "host locators are routing labels assigned to routers and hosts along one or multiple spanning trees .",
    "the labeling approach used in tagnet to assign locators is due to thorup and zwick @xcite .",
    "tagnet results in fibs that are much smaller than the fibs required in ndn ; however , it has a number of limitations .",
    "content requests ( interests ) must state the locators of their sources , which eliminates the anonymity provided in ndn and ccnx . like any other scheme based on compact - routing , the paths traversed over the labeled spanning",
    "trees can have some stretch over the shortest paths .",
    "the thorup - zwick labeling used in tagnet is a depth - first search approach , and entire spanning trees may have to be relabeled after a single link failure .",
    "no prior work exists showing that tagnet or similar routing schemes based on interval - routing labels are suitable for large networks subject to topology changes or mobility of hosts and routers .",
    "we use the term _ anchor _ to denote a router that , as part of the operation of the name - based routing protocol , announces the content corresponding to a name prefix being locally available .",
    "if multiple mirroring sites host the content corresponding to a name prefix , then the routers attached to those sites announce the same name prefix .",
    "however , a router simply caching cos from a name prefix does not announce the name prefix in the name - based routing protocol .",
    "an anchor announcement can be done implicitly or explicitly as part of the operation of the name - based routing protocol running in the control plane , and routers simply caching cos are not anchors .",
    "for example , in ndn @xcite and other name - based routing protocols based on link - state information @xcite , routers exchange link - state announcements ( lsa ) corresponding to either name prefixes or adjacencies to networks or routers . in this context ,",
    "any router that originates an lsa for a name prefix is an anchor of the prefix . on the other hand , dcr @xcite and other name - based content routing protocols ( e.g. , @xcite ) based on distance information to name prefixes use the names of anchors to ensure the correctness of the multi - path route computation @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fibs ] shows an example of a content - centric network in which router @xmath1 is an anchor for prefixes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ; and router @xmath5 is an anchor for prefixes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath2 .",
    "dark solid arrowheads show the best next hop towards name prefixes .",
    "a red arrowhead indicates the best next hop to name prefixes with cos locally available at router @xmath1 , and a dashed arrow head indicates the best next hop towards name prefixes with cos locally available at router @xmath5 .",
    "the fib entries at router @xmath8 are shown when fib entries are maintained for all instances of each name prefix , the nearest instances of a name prefix , or only for the anchors of name prefixes .",
    "this example illustrates the fact that routes to instances of name prefixes must also be routes to the anchors announcing those instances .",
    "therefore , the paths obtained from fib entries listing name prefixes are the same as the paths obtained from fib entries listing the anchors of name prefixes .",
    "it is important to note that a router acts as the anchor of a name prefix over time scales that are many orders of magnitude larger than either the time scale at which congestion varies in a network due to traffic or even topology changes , or the time needed for all routers to respond to congestion changes .",
    "even though current internet routing protocols do not handle congestion or multi - path routing well , the necessary and sufficient conditions for minimum - delay routing ( or minimum - congestion routing ) are well known @xcite and practical approaches that provide very good approximations to optimum routing using datagrams have existed for some time @xcite .",
    "given the long time periods over which routers act as anchors of name prefixes , these approaches can be used in either routing to name prefixes or routing to the anchors of name prefixes .",
    "furthermore , existing name - based routing protocols can easily apply mechanisms to react to congestion , namely : multi - path routing , maintaining congestion information about local interfaces , and path - based measurements of congestion .",
    "accordingly , it can be safely assumed that congestion - oriented multi - path routing is attained independently of whether routes are established for name prefixes or anchors .",
    "the following theorem formalizes the result illustrated in figure 1 for the case of shortest - path routing ( single path or multi - path ) to name prefixes .",
    "we show that , if the same name - based routing protocol is used to establish routes to anchors and to name prefixes , the paths traversed by interests are the same or mostly the same .",
    "[ theo1 ] the paths to name prefixes obtained using forwarding entries listing the name prefixes are the same as the paths obtained using forwarding entries listing the anchors of name prefixes in a stable network in which a correct name - based routing protocol is executed .    consider a content - centric network in which forwarding entries list the next hops to the anchors of name prefixes .",
    "assume that the routing protocol computes the paths to all the known anchors by time @xmath9 and that no changes occur in the network after that time .",
    "consider a name prefix @xmath10 for which router @xmath11 is an anchor , and assume for the sake of contradiction that , at some time @xmath12 , there is a route from a router @xmath13 to the instance of prefix @xmath10 announced by anchor @xmath11 that is shorter than any of the routes from @xmath13 to @xmath11 implied by the forwarding tables maintained by routers at @xmath14 .",
    "this is a contradiction to the definition of an anchor and the assumption that the routing protocol computes correct routes to all anchors by time @xmath9 and no changes occur after that .",
    "[ coro ] for any name prefix that has a single anchor , the paths to the name prefix obtained using forwarding entries listing name prefixes are the same as the paths obtained using forwarding entries listing the anchors of name prefixes .",
    "the proof follows from theorem 1 for the case of a stable topology .",
    "if forwarding tables are inconsistent due to network dynamics , the result follows from the one - to - one correspondence between a name prefix and its anchor , given that the prefix is hosted at a single site .",
    "figure [ fig : ex2 ] illustrates a content - centric network in which name prefix @xmath2 is multi - homed .",
    "assume that router @xmath15 receives an interest for a co with a name in prefix @xmath2 from consumer @xmath16 , and the nearest anchor of @xmath2 to router @xmath15 is @xmath17 .",
    "in the example , @xmath18 denotes the length of the pat from router @xmath19 to router @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denotes the distance from @xmath13 to @xmath17 along a path that does not include @xmath8 .",
    "if routing is based on anchor names , router @xmath15 binds the co name to anchor @xmath17 .",
    "assume that the shortest path from @xmath15 to @xmath17 includes router @xmath13 and that @xmath8 is the next hop from @xmath13 to @xmath17 .",
    "consider the case in which , because link @xmath22 fails or becomes too congested , router @xmath13 must find an alternative path to forward an interest intended for anchor @xmath17 .",
    "anchor @xmath23 is the closest anchor of prefix @xmath2 to router @xmath13 after the change in link @xmath22 .",
    "routing based on name prefixes can provide more efficient forwarding than routing based on anchor names only if one of the following conditions is true :    @xmath24 @xmath25    only a small number of interests pertaining to name prefixes that are multi - homed may be forwarded more efficiently if routing based on name prefixes is used .",
    "the reason for this is that equations 1 and 2 can not be satisfied over extended time periods .",
    "the name - based routing protocol operating in the control plane must make router @xmath15 update its distances to anchors reflecting the change in link @xmath22 .",
    "once router @xmath15 updates its forwarding table , it must select @xmath17 or another anchor as the new nearest anchor for @xmath2 and interests would traverse new shortest paths .",
    "we observe that this is the case even if mobility of hosting sites or consumers occurs , because the efficiency of interest forwarding is determined by the distances between the routers attached to consumers and the routers attached to hosting sites ( anchors ) .",
    "ccn - ramp allows routers to forward interests by looking up small forwarding tables listing next hops to anchors . clearly , for this to work , routers need to first obtain the mapping of the co name stated in an interest to an anchor of the name prefix that best matches the co name .",
    "ccn - ramp takes advantage of the fact that existing name - based routing protocols communicate the anchor of a name prefix as part of an lsa or a distance update for the prefix @xcite . using the information disseminated in the name - based routing protocol , a router builds and maintains two tables : a forwarding to anchors base ( fab ) listing the routes to anchors , and a prefix resolution table ( prt ) listing the anchors of each name prefix .    a router receiving an interest from a local",
    "consumer ( call it origin router ) uses its prt to bind the co name to the nearest anchor for the name prefix that is the best match for the co name . to allow relaying routers to use only their fabs to forward interests",
    ", an interest states the name of the anchor chosen by the origin router .",
    "the origin router and other relaying routers forward the interest as needed using their fabs and the anchor name in the interest .",
    "routers in ccn - ramp use exactly the same amount of routing signaling as routers in ndn and ccnx , and a prt in ccn - gram has as many entries as a fib in ndn and ccnx . however , the amount of routing signaling is not a problem , because anchors of name prefixes change infrequently and the name - based routing protocol can send updates regarding anchor - prefix bindings independently of updates regarding how to reach anchors . the limitation of using a fib listing name prefixes is not its size but the need to look up the fib in real time for each interest being forwarded , which either requires very expensive memory or renders very slow lookup times .    in ndn and ccnx ,",
    "each router forwarding an interest must look up a fib based on name prefixes because name resolution and routing are merged into one operation .",
    "by contrast , name resolution in ccn - ramp is delegated to the origin routers that receive interests from local consumers .",
    "each router is in effect a name resolver .",
    "an origin router that binds a co name to an anchor by looking up its prt in response to an interest from a local consumer replaces the role of the dns to resolve a name into an address .",
    "however , consumers are relieved from being involved in name resolution .",
    "what can take hundreds of milliseconds using the dns takes just a lookup of the prt , which can be implemented using tries and slow storage .",
    "once the binding of a co name to an anchor is done by an origin router , forwarding an interest involves fast lookups of fabs that can be even smaller than the fibs used in the ip internet today because only anchors are listed .",
    "the tradeoff made in ccn - ramp compared to prior approaches that separate name resolution from address - based routing is the need for each router to store a prt .",
    "this is acceptable , given the cost of memory today and the infrequency with which prt entries must be updated .",
    "the design of ccn - ramp eliminates forwarding loops by ordering the routers forwarding interests based on their distances to destinations @xcite . to attain this , each interest carries the distance to an anchor and fabs list the next hops _ and _ the distances to anchors .",
    "ccn - ramp extends our prior work @xcite to eliminate the use of pits while providing the same degree of interest anonymity enabled in ndn and ccnx .",
    "a router maintains a label swapping with anchors table ( lsat ) to remember the reverse paths traversed by interests , and uses anonymous identifiers ( aid ) with local scope to denote the origins of interests .",
    "the origin of an interest is denoted with an aid that is swapped at each hop .",
    "we make a few assumptions to simplify our description of ccn - ramp ; however , they should not be considered design requirements . for convenience , a request for content from a local user is sent to its local router in the form of an interest .",
    "interests are retransmitted only by the consumers that originated them , rather than routers that relay interests , routers forward interest based on lpm , and a router can determine whether or not the co with the exact same co name is stored locally .",
    "routers know which interfaces are neighbor routers and which are local consumers , and forward interests on a best - effort basis .",
    "allowing anchors with only subsets of the cos in the name prefixes they announce requires routers to determine which of the anchors announcing the name prefix actually host the requested co. this can be accomplished in ccn - ramp using the multi - instantiated destination spanning trees ( midst ) described in @xcite .",
    "the pros and cons of allowing anchors to host only subsets of the cos in name prefixes , and the search mechanisms needed to support it , are the subject of another publication . in the rest of this paper , we assume that each anchor of a name prefix is required to have _ all _ the cos in the name prefix locally available .",

    "we implemented ccn - ramp in ndnsim @xcite based on algorithms 1 to 4 and used the ndn implementation in ndnsim without modifications to compare ndn with ccn - ramp .",
    "we also compare ccn - ramp against our previous proposal for the elimination of pits using datagrams , ccn - gram @xcite , which also relies on name - based routing in the control plane and uses fibs listing the next hops to known name prefixes to forward interests .",
    "the performance metrics used for comparison are the average sizes of forwarding tables , the average number of table lookups needed to obtain one co , the average end - to - end delays , and the average number of interests sent by routers .",

    "we used the at&t network topology , which is considered to be a realistic topology for simulations @xcite .",

    "we selected 70 nodes randomly to have a consumer application simulating local consumers .",
    "all consumers generate interests requesting cos from all name prefixes following a zipf distribution with parameter @xmath130 .",
    "the total number of cos is only @xmath131 , with 1000 cos per name prefix .",
    "we used a relatively small content population , because using larger numbers for cos and name prefixes would just make ccn - ramp look better compared to ndn .",
    "we selected 20 of the nodes randomly to be anchors of 500 different name prefixes each , and each name prefix has a single anchor .    given that prefixes are not multi - homed in our simulation scenarios , the results in section 3 indicate that the paths traversed by interests should be the same whether forwarding tables maintain routes to anchors or to prefixes .",
    "this is the case for both single - path and multi - path routing .",
    "accordingly , for simplicity , our simulation experiments assume single - path routing and static topologies .",
    "the difference between ccn - ramp and ccn - gram @xcite ( its counter - part based on fibs listing name prefixes ) is that the latter incurs more forwarding overhead by its use of fibs .",
    "figure [ tablesize ] shows the average table sizes for ndn , ccn - ramp , and ccn - gram on a logarithmic scale as a function of the rate at which interests arrive at routers with local consumers , ranging from 100 to 2000 interests per second .",
    "the number of entries in the prts used in ccn - ramp is the same as the number of entries in the fibs used in ndn and ccn - gram , because both list an entry for each known name prefix . given that the topology contains 20 producer nodes and each node has 500 different name prefixes , each prt and fib table is expected to have 10,000 entries .    for ccn - ramp ,",
    "the average number of fab entries for all interest rates is only 20 and the average size of an lsat , which is used to forward responses to interests back to consumers , is only 41 entries for all values of interest rates .",
    "the small sizes of fabs and lsats should be expected , because there are only 20 routers acting as anchors , and each router acts as a relay of only a fraction of the paths to such anchors .",
    "the average size of the forwarding table used in ccn - gram to send responses to interests towards consumers ( called art ) is only 14 entries for all interest rates .",
    "by contrast , the number of pit entries depends on network conditions and traffic load .",
    "the average pit size varies from 23 or 24 to 426 or 435 , depending on whether on - path caching is used .",
    "the size of pits at some core routers can be more than 1000 entries when the request rate at routers with local consumers is 2000 interests per second .",
    "interestingly , the average number of pit entries is not much smaller when on - path caching is used compared to the case in which no caching is used .",
    "figure [ lookupcnt ] shows the average number of table lookups required to retrieve a single co , and includes all lookups done in forwarding the interest for the co and sending back the corresponding co to the requesting origin router .    in ndn",
    ", forwarding an interest requires a pit lookup at each hop along the path from consumer to caching site or anchor .",
    "if no pit entry is found , a fib lookup is required to obtain the next hop for the interest .",
    "forwarding a data packet sent from an anchor or a caching site requires a pit lookup at every hop along the way to the consumer .    in ccn - ramp",
    ", retrieving a remote co includes one prt lookup at the router that receives the interest from a local consumer .",
    "that router binds the co name to an anchor and each router along the path towards the anchor must do one fab lookup to forward the first interest with an aid that does not exist in the lsat of the router , and one lsat lookup for every interest being forwarded .",
    "once forwarding state is established along a path from an originating router to an anchor , no fab lookups are needed for interests that carry aids already listed in the lsats of the relaying routers .",
    "as figure [ lookupcnt ] shows , the average number of fab lookups per interest is a very small fraction , because only a small fraction of interests are forwarded without having any forwarding state already established in the lsats of routers .    in ccn - gram , retrieving a remote co involves one fib lookup at each hop along the path from consumer to caching site or anchor , as well as a lookup of the art in order to carry out the proper swapping of aids .",
    "forwarding a data packet sent from an anchor or a caching site requires only an art lookup at each hop along the way to the consumer .",
    "compared to ndn and ccn - gram , ccn - ramp results in relay routers doing fewer lookups of tables that are three orders of magnitude smaller than fibs listing name prefixes , even for the small scenario we consider .",
    "it can be inferred from figure [ lookupcnt ] that the average hop count for paths traversed by interests is around four or five hops , because this is the approximate number of average fib lookups needed in ndn and ccn - gram when no caching is used . as should be expected ,",
    "the average number of table lookups in ndn , ccn - gram , and ccn - ramp is slightly larger when no on - path caching is available , because the average paths between consumers requesting cos and the anchors are longer than the average paths between consumers and caching sites .",
    "figure [ intcnt ] shows the average number of interests sent by each router .",
    "as the results indicate , the average encumber of interests sent by each router is essentially the same for all three approaches and the percentage of interests that benefit from aggregation using pits is insignificant .",
    "figure [ delay ] shows that the average end - to - end delays are very similar in all cases for ndn and ccn - ramp .",
    "given that the simulations assume zero delays for table lookups ( i.e. , the differences in forwarding table sizes are not taken into account ) , these simulation results indicate that the paths traversed by interests are the same for ndn , ccn - gram , and ccn - ramp .",
    "this confirms that the paths traversed by interests when routers maintain fibs with entries for name prefixes tend to be the same as the paths traversed by interests if the origin routers select the anchors of name prefixes and routers forward interests towards anchors .",
    "scaling has been identified as a major research problem for content - centric networks @xcite .",
    "we introduced ccn - ramp , a new approach to content - centric networking that can be deployed at internet scale and is able to handle billions of name prefixes , because it eliminates the need to lookup large fibs listing name prefixes , and the use of pits that make routers vulnerable to ddos attacks on the routing infrastructure .",
    "ccn - ramp provides all the benefits sought by ndn and ccnx , including native support of multicasting without the need for a new multicast routing protocol ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to ndn and ccnx , interests can not traverse forwarding loops and no interest - flooding attacks can be mounted .",
    "the results of simulation experiments based on implementations of ndn , ccn - gram , and ccn - ramp in ndnsim show that ccn - ramp is more efficient than ndn and ccn - gram .",
    "ccn - ramp rendered similar end - to - end delays , incurred similar interest overhead in the data plane , and resulted in forwarding state with a number of entries that can be orders of magnitude smaller than the forwarding state required in ndn .",
    "our results open up several research avenues on content - centric networking at internet scale .",
    "important next steps include : analyzing the performance impact of the dynamics of name - based routing protocols adapting to congestion and topology changes , analyzing the impact of multihoming of name prefixes , enabling hierarchical name - based routing in the control plane , defining the role of autonomous systems , and analyzing policy - based routing and forwarding across autonomous systems ."
