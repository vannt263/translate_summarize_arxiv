    "the coordinates of their atomic positions are transformed as follows : @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 . due to the fact that the number of parameters is considerably enlarged the following constraints were used for the atoms located at @xmath96 : atoms labeled with a",
    "get the coordinates @xmath104 , atoms b @xmath105 , atoms c @xmath106 , and atoms d @xmath107 .",
    "further the anisotropic thermal parameters of each set ( a , b , c , d ) were constrained to be equal during the refinements .",
    "these constraints are justified because they ensure that the positions of all the ions except the @xmath51-coordinate of cr3 and o3 are identical within each of the 4 original unit cells that make one supercell . in the end",
    "the number of refineable parameters could be reduced to the same number as for the refinement of _ model 3 _ and the refinement of this supergroup structure consequently results in the same residuals as found for _",
    "model 3_. thus it is not possible to distinguish between these models simply by the goodness of fit .",
    "nevertheless the supergroup provides a more physical description of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 as it allows full occupancy of all sites .",
    "one consequence of the supercell is that superlattice peaks at ( @xmath108,@xmath108,0 ) positions ( in the coordinate system of the original cell ) are expected due to the cr3a / cr3b and o3a / o3b ordering which doubles the unit cell along both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions .",
    "these superlattice peaks are not observable in the powder measurements or in the neutron single crystal data probably because they have very weak intensity . in order to search for these superlattice peaks",
    "we have performed high resolution/ high intensity x - ray synchrotron single - crystal diffraction at the swiss - norwegian beam line at the esrf , grenoble , france .",
    "indeed very weak additional reflections corresponding to a lattice doubling of @xmath3 and @xmath4 were observed confirming the correctness of the superstructure model .",
    "the reciprocal @xmath84 scattering plane is shown in figure  [ fig : superstructure](b ) .",
    "super - structure reflections are visible which obey the reflection condition @xmath109 of the space group of the enlarged unit cell ( also @xmath14 ) , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the reciprocal lattice units of the supercell and can be written in terms of the reciprocal lattice units @xmath85 and @xmath86 of the conventional cell as @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "the new reflections are also visible in the projection onto the @xmath87 plane shown in figure  [ fig : superstructure](c ) . in this plane",
    "it becomes obvious that the superstructure reflections have a diffuse character almost forming lines of scattering along the [ @xmath114 direction .",

    "since sharp half - order bragg peaks have been observed in the @xmath84 plane , the superstructure is well ordered in the @xmath13 plane as shown in figure  [ fig : superstructure](a ) .",
    "therefore the diffuse character of the peaks must be caused by stacking faults along the @xmath7 axis .",
    "unfortunately , the weakness of the superstructure reflections and their diffuse character did not allow us to use them in a crystal structure refinement .",
    "the fact that both reciprocal planes presented in figure  [ fig : superstructure ] show additional weak reflections only at the positions which fulfill the reflection condition @xmath109 of the supercell however confirms the proposed enlarged unit cell .",
    "lastly it should be noted that the superstructure reflections as well as the diffuse scattering remain unchanged down to the lowest measured temperature of 100  k.      the chemical formula of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 suggests that the chromium ions must have an average valence of + 5.143 in order to balance the + 2 valence of the ca@xmath116 ions and the -2 valence of the o@xmath117 ions . as an insulating compound",
    "we propose that the cr ions are charge ordered with a ratio of cr@xmath5 to cr@xmath6 of 6:1 .",
    "it is clearly interesting to know which of the cr ions have valence + 5 and which have valence + 6 .",
    "this can be achieved by calculating the bond valence sum ( bvs ) using our refined interatomic distances .",
    "the cr - o bond distances within each cro@xmath82 tetrahedra are listed in table [ tab : bvs ] .",
    "the calculation of the bvs for the four inequivalent chromium ions cr1 , cr2 , cr3a and cr3b , was performed using these cr - o distances and the formula @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the ideal bond length , @xmath120 the observed bond length and @xmath121 , an empirical parameter for chromium ions .",
    "the values @xmath122   and @xmath123   for cr@xmath5 of and cr@xmath6 respectively were taken from i. d. brown _ et al .",
    "the results of the bvs calculation are also shown in table [ tab : bvs ] .",
    "the bvs values of cr3a and cr3b are close to + 6 while those of cr1 and cr2 are close to + 5 .",
    "since the number ratio of the different chromium ions is cr1:cr2:cr3 = 3:3:1 , the cr1 and cr2 sites together account for six cr@xmath5 ions while the cr3a / cr3b sites together account for only one cr@xmath6 ion , therefore the average valence from the bvs calculation is @xmath124 .",
    "the chemical formula of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2can hence also be written as ca@xmath0(cr@xmath125o@xmath17)@xmath23(cr@xmath126o@xmath17 ) .",
    "this result confirms the charge ordering suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and is also consistent with the results of a previous xanes measurements which found an average cr valence of 5.3(1 ) @xcite .",
    "the chromium charge ordering has important implications for the magnetic properties of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "cr3a and cr3b with oxidation state + 6 have no electrons in their @xmath127-shell while cr1 and cr2 with oxidation state + 5 have one unpaired electron ( @xmath128 ) . thus cr3a and",
    "cr3b have spin zero and are non - magnetic whereas cr1 and cr2 have spin-@xmath12 . to learn more about the magnetic properties we performed magnetization and dc susceptibility measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : mag_sus](a ) shows the magnetization at 1.8  k with field applied along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "the magnetization increases rapidly and then becomes constant above @xmath129 t showing that this field is strong enough to overcome the interactions between the magnetic cr@xmath5 ions and force them to point along the field direction . since the cr@xmath5 ions have spin @xmath130 they will each contribute @xmath131 ( assuming @xmath132 ) to the magnetization , while the cr@xmath6 ions with spin @xmath133 will not contribute . since the ratio of cr@xmath5 to cr@xmath6 is 6:1 ,",
    "the expected saturation magnetization per cr ion is @xmath134 .",
    "the experimental value of the saturation magnetization 0.851@xmath135 is in good agreement with the expected one confirming the predicted spin values and valences of the cr ions .",
    "further evidence for these spin values and valences comes from dc susceptibility measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : mag_sus](b ) shows the susceptibility @xmath136 and inverse susceptibility @xmath137 measured with a field of 0.1  t. the inverse susceptibility follows a straight line suggesting curie - weiss behavior .",
    "the data in the temperature range 50 - 250 k was fitted by the curie - weiss law @xmath138 , giving the curie - weiss temperature @xmath139  k and the curie constant @xmath140 .",
    "the curie constant can be used to extract the effective moment ( @xmath141 ) and gives @xmath142 per cr@xmath5ion assuming 6 out of every 7 cr ions have @xmath130 while the 7@xmath143 has @xmath133 .",

    "axis at 1.8  k. ( b)susceptibility ( right axis ) and inverse susceptibility ( left axis ) measured from 1.8 - 400  k for a field of 0.1  t parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath7 axis .",
    "the curie - weiss fit of @xmath137 yields @xmath146  k as shown in the inset.[fig : mag_sus ] ]    finally it should be mentioned that the susceptibility is independent of field direction . this indicates the absence of significant magnetic anisotropy in this compound which in turn suggest that the orbital moment of the cr@xmath5 ions in ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 is almost fully quenched . while substantial quenching of orbital moment in transition metal ions such as chromium is quite common due to their strong crystal field compared to their spin - orbit coupling , there is often a weak residual anisotropy due to a small amount of unquenched moment .",
    "as mentioned before , cr@xmath5 ions have a single unpaired electron in the @xmath127-shell , because of the tetrahedral crystal field produced by the surrounding o@xmath117 ions this electron will occupy the lower lying @xmath147 orbitals .",
    "furthermore because of the highly distorted nature of the cro@xmath82 tetrahedron for all cr sites we expect that the @xmath147 doublet is split into two non - degenerate levels with the electron occupying the lowest level ( see table [ tab : bvs ] which shows that the cr1-o and cr2-o bond distances are all different ) .",
    "absence of orbital degeneracy for a single electron in the @xmath127 shell is expected to lead to a highly quenched orbital moment and a very isotropic magnetic moment with spin@xmath24 as observed experimentally .",
    ": cr1 and cr2 are green , cr3a and cr3b are blue and light blue .",
    "cr1 and cr2 are magnetic with spin while cr3a and cr3b are non - magnetic .",
    "the seven shortest magnetic exchange paths @xmath148 between cr1 and cr2 are indicated by the colored bonds .",
    "the dashed black box indicates a kagome bilayer .",
    "( b ) the kagome bilayer displayed in the @xmath13 plane.[fig : struct_bilayer ] ]    to summarize we have solved the crystal structure of ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 and shown that it can be well described by the conventional unit cell where the cr3 and o3 sites are both disordered between two positions ( cr3a / cr3b and o3a / o3b ) whose occupancies have the ratio 3:1 and sum to 100% .",
    "a more realistic model is for the cr3a / cr3b and o3a / o3b sites to order giving rise to a doubling of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 lattice parameters while preserving all other aspects of the crystal structure .",
    "evidence for this supercell comes from the observation of superlattice peaks at half - order positions as we have found in the x - ray single crystal data .",
    "ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 is a mixed valence compound with a ratio of cr@xmath6 to cr@xmath5 of 6:1 . by performing a bond valence sum we showed that the cr3a and cr3b ions have valence + 6 while the cr1 and cr2 ions have valence + 5",
    "this charge order has important consequences for the magnetism because while cr@xmath6 ions are non - magnetic , cr@xmath5 ions have a spin value of s=1/2 .",
    "magnetization and susceptibility measurements confirm that 6 out of 7 cr ions have spin-1/2 in accordance with the number ratio of cr1 and cr2 ions to cr3a and cr3b ions .    from the point of view of the magnetic behavior ,",
    "the cr3a and cr3b are unimportant and can be neglected .",
    "it should be further mentioned that there is no difference concerning the magnetic cr1 and cr2 ions between the convention unit cell and the supercell since the superstructure results from the site ordering of the non - magnetic cr3a / cr3b ions and the o3a / o3b ions while the other ions are unaffected .",
    "the positions of the magnetic cr1 and cr2 ions within the convention unit cell along with the seven nearest neighbor exchange interactions that couple them are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct_bilayer ] .",
    "they form a kagome bilayer structure within the @xmath13-plane where the bilayers are stacked in an abc type arrangement along the @xmath7 axis . both kagome layers that form the bilayers consist of two equilateral triangles of different sizes ( and therefore inequivalent interactions ) that share corners and alternate throughout the plane .",
    "this particular arrangement of corner - sharing spin@xmath24 triangles coupled into bilayers has not been reported in any other compound .",
    "it provides the source of highly frustrated magnetism that leads to the quantum spin liquid behavior observed in ca@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 as described by c. balz _ et al . _ in ref .",
