    "it is now generally accepted that the energy density of the universe includes a substantial fraction of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , constituting roughly @xmath0 of the closure density .",
    "it is normally assumed that the cdm particle does not interact with ordinary baryonic matter or with photons ; hence the `` dark '' in cold dark matter .",
    "however , a small scattering cross section can not be entirely ruled out , only constrained by observations .",
    "several different models are possible for interactions between ordinary matter and cdm .",
    "one possibility is strongly interacting dark matter ( also known as strongly interacting massive particles , or simps ) , in which the cdm particle couples to baryons , but not to photons or electrons .",
    "recently , to solve the small scale problem in cdm models , strongly self - interacting particles were suggested @xcite , with @xmath1 the range quoted here ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) is narrower than originally proposed in @xcite because of additional constraints .",
    "while the original spergel - steinhardt cross section applies only to dark matter self - interaction , if such an interaction is mediated by the strong force , then the dark matter might also interact strongly with baryons@xcite .",
    "examples of such dark matter includes , e.g. , quark - gluino bound states @xcite , strangelets @xcite , gauge singlet mesons @xcite , and q - balls @xcite . limits on such interactions were investigated by starkman et al .",
    "@xcite , and recently reexamined in references @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is to couple the dark matter particle electromagnetically , e.g. , by giving it a tiny electromagnetic charge ( see , e.g. , reference @xcite and references therein ) ; such a cdm particle will scatter primarily off of photons and free electrons .    any interactions of this sort will affect the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations , since they act to transfer momentum from the dark matter to the baryon - photon fluid , although for wimps this effect is negligible @xcite .",
    "current cmb observations can place constraints on such models .",
    "the case of direct interactions between the cdm particle and photons has already been examined @xcite , so we do not consider it here . while the model discussed in reference @xcite is not identical to the case of electromagnetically",
    "charged dark matter , since it includes photon - cdm interactions but not electron - cdm interactions , we expect it to be qualitatively similar to the charged dark matter model .",
    "therefore , we consider only the case of strongly - interacting dark matter , in which the dark matter particle couples to baryons ( only ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we give the perturbation equations for cdm which couples to baryons , and we show the matter transfer function and cmb power spectra for some representative cases . in sec .",
    "3 , we compare our calculations with the cmb observations to derive constraints on the cross section for dark matter - baryon scattering , and we compare to previously - derived limits .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "we begin by assuming a scattering cross section @xmath2 between the cdm particle of mass @xmath3 and protons with mass @xmath4 , and we derive the changes to the perturbation equations produced by this scattering interaction .",
    "our starting point is the set of perturbation equations in reference @xcite , which form the basis for cmbfast @xcite .",
    "we will not reproduce here all of the perturbation equations , but simply give those equations which are modified .    following reference @xcite , we work in the synchronous gauge . however , because the cdm is interacting it does not provide a natural way of defining the synchronous coordinates , as opposed to standard cdm @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the density fluctuation ( @xmath7 ) for the cold dark matter and the baryons , respectively , and let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be the corresponding velocity divergences .",
    "then for the cold dark matter , we have @xmath10 for baryons the corresponding terms are @xmath11 with @xmath12 in these equations @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the adiabiatic sound speed of the cdm and baryons , respectively , @xmath15 is the average relative velocity between the cdm and the baryons , and @xmath16 are the momentum transfer terms .",
    "the sound speeds are given by @xmath17 the average relative velocity by @xmath18 in calculating average velocities we have assumed thermal maxwell - boltzmann distributions for both cdm and baryons .",
    "the temperature evolution of the dark matter and baryons is given by @xmath19    it is possible to obtain analytical solutions for the temperature evolution equations , but they are complicated and cumbersome to use .",
    "instead , we use a semi - implicit scheme to integrate these differential equations .",
    "we tested this method in a few cases , and found that it produces solutions which agree with the analytical solutions within 0.2% , and the effect on the cmb spectrum is negligible .",
    "this set of equations ignores the fact that the baryonic fluid consists of two species : hydrogen and helium-4 , in a roughly 3 to 1 ratio by mass . to account for the presence of helium as well as hydrogen",
    ", we make the following replacements :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the primordial mass fraction of helium-4 ( we take @xmath22 throughout ) , and we define separate velocities for the hydrogen and helium relative to the dark matter :    @xmath23    in our calculations , @xmath2 , the scattering cross section between the cdm particle and the proton , is a free parameter which we will constrain from the observations .",
    "however , we need to make some sort of assumption regarding @xmath24 , the scattering cross section between cdm and helium nuclei . for coherent scattering ,",
    "we expect @xmath25 , while a spin - dependent cross section would yield @xmath26 . for now , we will examine the intermediate case of incoherent scattering , for which @xmath27 . later , in sec . 3 , we will extend our calculation to consider both coherent scattering and spin - dependent scattering .",
    "taking @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , the above substitution can be achieved by simply replacing everywhere    @xmath30\\\\ \\frac{m_c \\sigma \\vrel}{m_b+m_c }   & \\longrightarrow & \\frac{m_c \\sigma}{m_{\\rm h}+m_c } \\left[(1-y ) v_{\\rm h}+ y \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm he}}{\\sigma_{\\rm h}}\\right ) \\frac{m_{\\rm h}+ m_c}{4m_{\\rm h}+m_c } v_{\\rm he}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      following reference @xcite , we use a separate set of equations in the limit of tight coupling between baryons and photons . in the tight - coupling regime ,",

    "we have also assumed that it is a `` cold dark matter '' particle , i.e. during the whole range of our calculation it is non - relativistic , which translates to @xmath43 mev .",
    "we have also assumed that during each scattering only one baryon interacts with the dark matter particle .",
    "if the interaction length of the particle is @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , then we require that this interaction length be less than the inter - particle spacing : @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "processes which affect cmb anisotropy happen at redshift less than @xmath48 , so we can put a limit on the applicable cross section , neglecting factors of order unity : @xmath49 our calculation must be modified for @xmath50 to take into account multi - particle scattering .",
    "we have modified the cmbfast code @xcite to include the effects discussed in the previous sections . for initial conditions , we assume that the dark matter and baryons started tightly coupled with the same temperature .",
    "tensor modes have been ignored , and we consider only flat geometries ( @xmath51 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] we show the cmb fluctuation spectra and the corresponding square of the matter transfer function for some representative cases .",
    "the coupling of the dark matter to the baryons damps the matter power spectrum on small scales , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl](b ) .",
    "one might imagine that the effect on the cmb of coupling the baryons to the dark matter would be equivalent to a standard model with a larger value of @xmath52 .",
    "this is not the case , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl](a ) .",
    "although both models produce an increase in the amplitude of the first acoustic peak , the large @xmath52 model produces an increase in the amplitude of the third peak , while the strongly - interacting dark matter model yields a decrease in the third peak amplitude ( and in all of the other peaks as well ) .",
    "one can understand the difference between the cmb spectra in the following way : the baryon - photon oscillations are damped oscillations , with a damping rate ( viscosity ) inversely proportional to the baryon - photon interaction rate . interacting cdm with intermediate cross section",
    "amounts to adding `` baryons '' but simultaneously also increasing the viscosity of the plasma .",
    "therefore the acoustic oscillations damp quickly and all peaks but the first are suppressed .",
    "scales around the first acoustic peak have only undergone part of an oscillation and therefore have not been damped significantly .",
    "on such large scales the increase in oscillation amplitude due to added `` baryons '' is more important and the overall power spectrum increases .    on the other hand , increasing the baryon density has the well - known effect of increasing the height of the compression peaks ( 1st , 3rd , ... ) and decreasing the height of the decompression peaks ( 2nd , 4th , ... ) . of course , for very large cross sections , the effective viscosity of the cdm - baryon - photon plasma approaches that of a pure baryon - photon plasma and the cdm acts exactly like baryons .",
    "an effect similar to the increased viscosity due to cdm - baryon interactions can be seen in models with increased width of the last scattering surface due to non - standard recombination , where the effective viscosity of the baryon - photon plasma also increases around the time of recombination @xcite .",
    "the effect on the matter power spectrum seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl](b ) can be understood in the same way .",
    "the increased viscosity in the interacting model leads to a much stronger damping on small scales than in the model with increased baryon density .",
    "in order to constrain models with cdm - baryon interactions we compare the cmb and matter power spectra of such models with recent observational data .    _ cmb data set  _ several data sets of high precision are now publicly available .",
    "in addition to the cobe @xcite data for small @xmath53 there are data from boomerang @xcite , maxima @xcite , dasi @xcite and several other experiments @xcite .",
    "wang , tegmark and zaldarriaga @xcite have compiled a combined data set from all these available data , including calibration errors . in the present work we use this compiled data set , which is both easy to use and includes all relevant present information .    _",
    "lss data set  _ at present , by far the largest survey available is the 2df @xcite of which about 147,000 galaxies have so far been analysed .",
    "tegmark , hamilton and xu @xcite have calculated a power spectrum , @xmath54 , from this data , which we use in the present work .",
    "the 2df data extends to very small scales where there are large effects of non - linearity .",
    "since we only calculate linear power spectra , we use ( in accordance with standard procedure ) only data on scales larger than @xmath55 , where effects of non - linearity should be minimal .",
    "the cmb fluctuations are usually described in terms of the power spectrum , which is again expressed in terms of @xmath56 coefficients as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 the @xmath59 coefficients are given in terms of the actual temperature fluctuations as @xmath60 given a set of experimental measurements , the likelihood function is @xmath61 x \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is a vector describing the given point in parameter space , @xmath63 is a vector containing all the data points , and @xmath64 is the data covariance matrix .",
    "this applies when the errors are gaussian .",
    "if we also assume that the errors are uncorrelated , it can be reduced to the simple expression , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a @xmath67-statistic and @xmath68 is the number of power spectrum data points @xcite . in the present letter we use equation ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) for calculating @xmath67 . in the case where we also use",
    "lss data @xmath67 is instead given by    @xmath69    the procedure is then to calculate the likelihood function over the space of cosmological parameters .",
    "the 2d likelihood function for @xmath70 is obtained by keeping @xmath70 fixed and marginalising over all other parameters .    as free parameters in the likelihood analysis",
    "we use @xmath42 , the matter density , @xmath52 , the baryon density , @xmath71 , the hubble parameter , @xmath72 , the scalar spectral index , @xmath73 , the optical depth to reionization , and @xmath74 , the overall normalization of the data .",
    "when large scale structure constraints are included we also use @xmath75 , the normalization of the matter power spectrum , as a free parameter .",
    "this means that we treat @xmath74 and @xmath75 as free and uncorrelated parameters .",
    "this is very conservative and eliminates any possible systematics involved in determining the bias parameter .",
    "we constrain the analysis to flat ( @xmath76 ) models , and we assume that the tensor mode contribution is negligible ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "these assumptions are compatible with analyses of the present data @xcite , and relaxing them does not have a big effect on the final results .",
    "for maximizing the likelihood function we use a simulated annealing method , as described in reference  @xcite .    table i shows the different priors used . in the `` cmb ''",
    "prior the only important constraint is that @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) . for the cmb+@xmath71+bbn prior we use the constraint @xmath80 from the hst hubble key project @xcite ( the constraint is added assuming a gaussian distribution ) and the constraint @xmath81 from bbn @xcite . finally , in the @xmath71+bbn+lss case , we add data from the 2df survey @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we plot the constraints from various experiments in the @xmath70 plane in fig .  [ fig : excl ] ; limits obtained with different priors are plotted with different line styles .",
    "the shaded region is the `` spergel - steinhardt '' region as given in equation  ( [ eq : spergel - steinhardt ] ) ; note that it is actually narrower than plotted in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "this figure clearly shows that constraints from the cmb data alone for large cdm mass ( @xmath82 gev ) are comparable to limits from galactic disk heating arguments @xcite . on the other hand , for small cdm mass ( @xmath83 gev ) , the limit from the",
    "cmb alone is much stronger .",
    "this difference arises because the limits from disk heating are related to energy transfer , which decreases as @xmath84 for @xmath85 , while the limits from the cmb and large scale structure are based on momentum transfer , which decreases only as @xmath86 for @xmath87 . at the same time",
    ", the relative velocity also increases for low cdm mass ( as @xmath88 ) .",
    "this is the reason that , for @xmath87 , our bound goes as @xmath89 , but for the disk heating argument it goes as @xmath90 .",
    "our bound is therefore much stronger at low mass , even if only cmb data is used .",
    "the addition of priors on @xmath52 and @xmath71 does not increase the exclusion region by much , because there is very little degeneracy between @xmath70 and these two parameters . only when lss data is added do we find a significant improvement .",
    "the reason is that cdm - baryon interactions lead to a significant suppression of small scale power , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "even for relatively small cross sections this effect leads to a disagreement with the 2df data . with the inclusion of lss data ,",
    "our bound becomes much stronger than the disk heating argument of starkman _",
    "@xcite , even at large masses .",

    "equation ( [ fit ] ) is accurate to within 10% . for this case",

    "2 as thinner dashed curves above ( for @xmath26 ) and below ( for @xmath94 ) the limit for @xmath27 . altering @xmath24 in this way changes the upper bounds by a factor of roughly @xmath95 , which is barely noticeable on the scale of this graph .",
    "cmb observations constrain any scattering interaction between dark matter and baryons .",
    "our results indicate that the limit from current cmb observations is comparable to previous limits from disk heating @xcite for masses greater than 1 gev , and the cmb limit is much stronger at smaller masses .",
    "if we also include large - scale structure data , then our limit is more stringent that the disk - heating limit at all masses .",
