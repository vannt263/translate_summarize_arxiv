    "light harvesting complexes are the part of photosynthetic systems that channel energy from the antenna to the reaction centre .",
    "one of the most studied complexes is the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex @xcite which is part of the photosynthetic apparatus of green sulphur bacteria .",
    "the observation of long lasting beatings , up to @xmath0  ps at @xmath1  k in time - resolved two - dimensional ( 2d ) spectra @xcite has generated enormous interest in theoretical modelling the process of energy transfer through light - harvesting complexes .",
    "recently molecular - dynamics simulations started to develop a more microscopic picture of the dynamics @xcite , but an atomistic and fully quantum - mechanical model of the whole process reproducing the experimentally obtained spectra is not available .",
    "therefore theoretical models treat the light - harvesting pigment - protein complex as an exciton system coupled to a bath which accounts for the vibrational modes of the pigments .",
    "the choreography of the exciton - energy transfer can be elucidated with 2d echo - spectroscopy using three laser pulses which hit the sample within several femtoseconds time spacings .",
    "the experimentally measured 2d echo - spectra of the complex show a variety of beating patterns with oscillation periods roughly consistent with the differences in eigenenergies of the excited system obtained from fits to the absorption and 2d echo - spectra @xcite . at long delay times between pump and probe pulses the system displays relaxation to the energetically lowest lying exciton eigenstates as expected from the interactions between the electronic degrees of freedom and the vibrational modes of the complex which drive the system into a state of thermal equilibrium @xcite",
    ".    one main goal of the research in this field is to clarify the role of a disordered and fluctuating environment in the energy - transfer efficiency .",
    "theoretical quantum - transport studies show that the energy transfer in these systems results from a balance between coherent and dissipative dynamics @xcite .",
    "calculations at room temperature also show that the optimal energy - transport efficiencies appear as a compromise between coherent dynamics and thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "another open question in the theoretical study of these systems is the description of experimental observables , i.e.  the absorption and the 2d echo - spectra .",
    "most of the theoretical studies analyse the beatings in the population dynamics and compare them with the ones observed in the experimentally measured 2d echo - spectra . however , the 2d echo - spectrum reflects different information than the population dynamics and needs to be calculated and analysed separately in detail . in principle techniques such as",
    "quantum state and process tomography made out of a sequence of 2d echo - spectra can be used to map out the complete density matrix @xcite .",
    "in contrast to energy - transfer efficiency studies where an initial excitation enters the complex at specific sites close to the antenna , in 2d echo - spectra the whole complex is simultaneously excited .",
    "also the two - exciton manifold yields prominent contributions to the signal , resulting in negative regions in the 2d echo - spectra .  the non - pertubative calculation of 2d echo - spectra presents a considerable computational challenge due to the presence of two excitons giving raise to excited state absorption and the requirement to consider ensemble averages over differently orientated complexes with slightly varying energy levels .",
    "previous calculations have employed markovian approximations @xcite or exclude the double exciton manifold @xcite .",
    "in addition the systematic study of beatings in a series of 2d echo - spectra requires effective means to calculate a huge number of such spectra .",
    "so far no theoretical method has been able to describe the long - lasting beatings in the time - resolved 2d spectra @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for the persistence of long coherence times has been the sluggish absorption of the reorganisation energy by the molecule , which requires theoretical descriptions that go beyond the markovian approximation and the rotating wave approximation @xcite .",
    "the hierarchical equations of motions ( heom ) , first developed by tanimura and kubo @xcite and subsequently refined in @xcite , show oscillations in the dynamics of the exciton populations that persist even at temperature @xmath2  k @xcite .",
    "the heom include the reorganisation process in a transparent way and are directly applicable for computations at physiological temperatures .",
    "a recent calculation at temperature @xmath3  k of the 2d echo - spectra with the heom method has been performed by chen @xcite , which does not display the strong beatings observed experimentally .",
    "chen conclude that the agreement between theory and experiments needs to be improved . here , we analyse under what conditions the theoretical calculations give better agreement with the experimental results .",
    "we calculate the absorption and 2d echo - spectra in a temperature range between @xmath3  k to @xmath4  k using the heom and investigate the role of pigment and protein vibrations in the calculated spectra .",
    "we systematically discuss the parameters needed to obtain results that agree better with the experimentally measured spectra .",
    "we discuss the role of static disorder for the shapes of the peaks and the appearance of beatings in the time - resolved 2d echo - spectrum and their robustness against temperature changes and static disorder .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the exciton model and the heom are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "the absorption spectra and the line shapes obtained from the heom model of the fmo complex are analysed in sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] where we compare different methods for performing rotational averages . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] we discuss the 2d spectrum and analyse how disorder affects it .",
    "furthermore we analyse the persistence of beatings in the spectra as a function of the delay time for several temperatures and with and without static disorder .",
    "the fmo complex described by fenna , matthews and olson @xcite is a pigment - protein complex that channels the energy in the photosynthetic apparatus in green sulphur bacteria .",
    "the fmo complex is arranged as a trimer with the different subunits interacting weakly with each other .",
    "we thus restrict our study to a single subunit which contains eight bacteriochlorophyll molecules ( bchls ) @xcite .",
    "the bchls pigments , which are wrapped in a protein environment , can be electronically excited and are coupled due to dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "the bchls form a network that guides the energy from the antenna to the reaction centre .",
    "since the eighth bchl is only loosely bound it usually detaches from the others when the system is isolated from its environment to perform experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not take the eighth bchl into account and describe the energy transfer using the seven site frenkel exciton model @xcite .",
    "the single exciton manifold is given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "the state @xmath7 corresponds to an electronic excitation of bchl@xmath8 with site energy @xmath9 .",
    "dipole - dipole couplings between different chromophores yield the inter - site couplings @xmath10 , which lead to a delocalisation of the exciton over all bchls .",
    "the site energies of the bchls @xmath11 consist of ` zero - phonon energies ' @xmath12 , and a term due to the reorganisation hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "the reorganisation energy @xmath14 denotes the energy which is removed from the system to adjust the vibrational coordinates to the new equilibrium value @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath15 denotes a dimensionless displacement of the @xmath16th oscillator measured in units of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are mass and frequency of the @xmath16th oscillator .",
    "the vibrational modes of the bchl are modelled as a set of harmonic oscillators @xmath20 .",
    "the vibrational environment couples linearly to the exciton system @xmath21 and induces fluctuations in the site energies .",
    "we neglect correlations between the vibrations at different sites and model the coupling strength by a structureless spectral density @xmath22 where we assume identical couplings @xmath23 at each site .",
    "this choice of spectral density facilitates the use of the heom method since the time - dependent bath correlations then assume an exponential form . for the fmo complex a variety of spectral densities are discussed in the literature , where some are a parametrisation of experimental fluorescence spectra @xcite , while others are extracted from molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "we use the model hamiltonian for _ chlorobium tepidum _ given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian originates from previous calculations in @xcite .",

    "we set the parameters of the spectral density to @xmath29  @xmath26 and @xmath30  fs .",
    "these parameters are chosen to provide best agreement to the smooth part of the spectral density in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the low frequency component of the spectral density was fitted to fluorescence line narrowing spectra @xcite . since a single lorentz - drude peak is not sufficient to accurately reproduce the smooth part of the spectral density of ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose the parameters to obtain agreement within a factor of @xmath31 to @xmath32 in the energy range from @xmath33 to @xmath34  @xmath26 , which corresponds to the typical difference between the exciton energies .",
    "the heom approach rewrites time non - local effects into a hierarchy of coupled equations of motion for a set of auxiliary matrices @xmath35 .",

    "the rephasing stimulated emission diagram for @xmath54 and @xmath55 and found a difference of less than @xmath57  percent of the amplitude .",
    "we therefore consider a truncation at @xmath54 sufficient to reach converged results .",
    "the derivation of the hierarchy stated in ( [ eq : drho ] ) and ( [ eq : dsigma ] ) relies on a high temperature approximation . for a temperature of @xmath3",
    "k the high temperature approximation is not valid and low temperature correction terms have to be included @xcite . within the low temperature correction",
    "we replace @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the first bosonic matsubara frequency following @xcite .",
    "agreement with @xcite and proper thermalization to the boltzmann distribution @xcite confirms that the first order correction in ( [ eq : lowtemp ] ) is indeed sufficient .",
    "a further improvement of the low temperature correction can be attained by including higher matsubara terms .",
    "recently , also a pad spectrum decomposition has been proposed @xcite which shows faster convergence than the matsubara decomposition .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the heom requires to propagate a large number of auxiliary matrices .",
    "although the number of auxiliary matrices can be reduced by a scaled heom approach @xcite as well as by advanced filtering techniques @xcite , the heom are computationally very demanding , which sets limits to treatable system sizes . for 2d echo - spectroscopy one",
    "has to propagate the set of auxiliary matrices not only for a huge number of time steps ( typically of the order of @xmath60 ) , but also the dimension of the auxiliary matrices gets enlarged since excited state absorption requires to extend the exciton hamiltonian to the two exciton manifold .",
    "we overcome the computational limitation by using a gpu ( graphics processing unit ) implementation where the computation time goes down with the number of cores on a single gpu @xcite .",
    "for example on a single nvidia c2050 graphics board we obtain a @xmath61 fold speedup compared to an equivalent single - core cpu implementation . with our efficient gpu algorithm the computation time for a 2d spectrum",
    "is reduced to 50 minutes on a single gpu .",
    "spectroscopy provides a tool that gives direct insight into the energy states of a quantum system .",
    "absorption spectroscopy is used to identify the energy eigenstates and their interaction strengths with the radiation field , expressed in terms of dipole moments .",
    "the energy eigenstates and the dipole moments are commonly identified with the peak position and the peak areas respectively .",
    "the spectral peaks are broadened due to the interaction of the energy eigenstates with the remaining degrees of freedom of the system . for an ensemble of light - harvesting complexes the coupling of the electronic dynamics to the vibrational modes and the presence of fluctuations in the energy levels , due to e.g.",
    "the motion of the surrounding proteins , broadens the absorption peaks .    to calculate absorption - spectra we have to expand the system and add the ground state @xmath62 to our basis .",
    "the hamiltonian is thus extended to an @xmath63 block matrix @xmath64 where we have chosen the zero exciton energy @xmath65 and @xmath28 is the @xmath66 matrix defined in ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "using the same block structure as in ( [ eq:1d - h ] ) the dipole matrix that governs the photon - exciton conversion is constructed as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and the zero to single excitation dipole block @xmath69 is defined using the seven dipole moments @xmath70 that give the excitation of bchl@xmath8 by the laser pulse .",

    "the different methods for performing the rotational average denoted by @xmath74 are detailed below .",
    "the time evolution of the dipole operators in ( [ eq:1d - i ] ) is given by @xmath75 .",
    "in the fmo complex the seven bchl molecules have a fixed orientation with respect to each other . within this configuration",
    "each bchl has a dipole vector @xmath76 that characterises its interaction with light .",
    "we consider the dipole vectors of the bchls to be along the connection line of two nitrogen atoms n@xmath77n@xmath78 @xcite whose positions we obtain from the protein data bank @xcite .",
    "the norm of @xmath76 accounts for the strength of the dipole and we assume @xmath79 since all bchl molecules are identical . for the simulations we choose @xmath80 . given a polarisation direction of the laser @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 $ ] , the dipole moments in ( [ eq : mu_1ex ] ) read @xmath84 typical experiments",
    "are performed using spectroscopy of a sample solution and many fmo complexes are illuminated at the same time .",
    "each of them is randomly orientated with respect to the electric field in the laser pulse .",
    "if we assume a coherent dynamics expression ( [ eq:1d - i ] ) is readily evaluated in eigenbasis as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the @xmath87th eigenenergy and @xmath88 denotes the overlap of the @xmath44th state in site basis with the @xmath87th eigenstate .",
    "the integrationally averaged dipole moments in eigenbasis are @xmath89 thus , we obtain the integrationally averaged squares of dipole moments in the eigenbasis @xmath90 , where the eigenenergies increase from left to right . for an appropriate @xmath91 ,",
    "these values are in rough agreement with the averaged dipole moments obtained from a fit to the experimental spectrum @xmath92  debye@xmath93 @xcite .",
    "however , we can also read the result as @xmath94 , where the three polarisation vectors @xmath95 are orthogonal to each other .",
    "this now implies that the rotational average can be performed using three orthogonal directions for @xmath96 instead of sampling over the whole unit sphere .",
    "note that this calculation is valid only if the interaction of system and bath does not interfere with the rotational average .    in the following",
    "we discuss how the line - shapes of the peaks depend on the theoretical method and approximations commonly used for performing the time - dependent propagation in ( [ eq:1d - i ] ) before we return to the different methods of performing the rotational average .",

    "note that the eigenenergies of hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) include the reorganisation energy @xmath106 added to the `` bare exciton - energies '' .",

    "this result is expected , since there are several additional effects besides rotational averaging , which broaden the peaks and bring the simulation results closer to the experimental data . if we increase either @xmath106 ( not shown ) or the relaxation time @xmath105 , the peaks in the spectrum become broader , see figure  [ fig:1d - both ]  ( b ) .",
