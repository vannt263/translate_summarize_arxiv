    "luminous high - redshift quasars consist of supermassive black holes residing at the center of massive galaxies and growing through mass accretion of gas in an accretion disk .",
    "bright quasars play an important role in shaping their host galaxies through the emission of ionizing flux but also through launching powerful and high - velocity outflows of gas .",
    "these outflows inject energy and material to the disk of the galaxy and may be influencing the physical state up to larger distances .",
    "it has remained unclear however what are the mechanisms that drive energy from the very center of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to the outskirts of the galaxy .",
    "observational evidence for outflows and winds in agns is seen as prominent radio - jets in radio - loud sources , broad absorption lines observed in broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars , or through the photoionized warm absorber which is frequently observed in the soft x - rays ( e.g. crenshaw et al .",
    "gravitational micro - lensing studies have shown that the primary x - ray emission region in agn is of the order of a few tens of gravitational radii in size ( e.g. dai et al . 2010 ) and x - ray spectroscopy shows that highly ionized outflows launched from this region are seen in high-@xmath13 quasars ( chartas et al .",
    "2009 ) and in at least 40% of them with velocities up to 0.1  c ( gofford et al . 2013 ) .",
    "outflows are observed also on large scales .",
    "mullaney et al . ( 2013 ) used the sdss spectroscopic data base to study the one - dimensional kinematic properties of [ oiii]@xmath145007 by performing multicomponent fitting to the optical emission - line profiles of about 24000 , @xmath15 optically selected agns .",
    "they showed that approximately 17 percent of the agns have emission - line profiles that indicate their ionized gas kinematics are dominated by outflows and a considerably larger fraction are likely to host ionized outflows at lower levels .",
    "harrison et al . ( 2014 ) find high - velocity ionized gas ( velocity widths of about 600 - 1500  km  s@xmath11 ) with observed spatial extents of ( 6 - 16 )  kpc in a representative sample of @xmath16 , luminous ( i.e. @xmath17[o  iii]@xmath910@xmath18  erg  s@xmath11 ) type 2 agns .",
    "therefore galaxy - wide energetic outflows are not confined to the most extreme star - forming galaxies or radio - luminous agns .",
    "if outflows are observed both on small and large scales , how the small scale outflows are transported at larger distances remains unclear ( faucher - gigure et al .",
    "2012 , ishibashi & fabian 2015 , king & pounds 2015 ) .",
    "this is however a crucial question as these outflows are massive and energetic enough to significantly influence star formation in the host galaxy and provide significant metal enrichment to the interstellar and intergalactic media ( e.g. dubois et al . 2013 ) . at high redshift where quasars are more luminous",
    ", the consequences of such outflows are of first importance for galaxy formation . one way to study the interplay between the quasar and its surrounding is to search for lyman-@xmath2 emission around quasars ( e.g. hu & cowie 1987 , hu et al .",
    "1996 , petitjean et al .",
    "1996 , bunker et al .",
    "2003 , christensen et al .",
    "these observations reveal gas infalling onto the galaxy ( weidinger et al .",
    "2005 ) , positive feed - back from the agn ( rauch et al .",
    "2013 ) or a correlation between the luminosity of the extended emission and the ionizing flux from the quasar ( north et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "very recently , we searched quasar spectra from the sdss - iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; dawson et al .",
    "2014 ) for the rare occurrences where a strong damped lyman-@xmath2 absorber ( dla ) blocks the broad line region emission ( blr ) from the quasar and acts as a natural coronagraph to reveal narrow lyman-@xmath2 emission from the host galaxy ( finley et al . 2013",
    "; see also hennawi et al .",
    "this constitutes a new way to have direct access to the quasar host galaxy and possibly , when the size of the dla is small enough , to the very center of the agn . out of a total of more than 70,000 spectra of @xmath19 quasars ( pris et al .",
    "2012 ) , we gathered a sample of 57 such quasars and followed - up six of them with the slit spectrograph magellan - mage to search for the very special cases where the dla coronagraph reveals the very center of the host galaxy and extended lyman-@xmath2 emission . in the course of this follow - up program , we found one object sdss  j0823 + 0529 where the dla does not cover the lyman-@xmath2 broad line region entirely and reveals the emission of the lyman-@xmath2 and c  iv narrow line regions .",
    "we show here that this is a unique opportunity to study the link between the properties of the central regions of the agn to that of the gas in the halo of the quasar .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction .",
    "we derive properties of the gas associated with the dla ( metallicity , ionization state , density , distance to the quasar , typical size ) in section  3 .",
    "we discuss the properties of the quasar narrow line region and of the extended lyman-@xmath2 emission in sections 4 and 5 , respectively , we then finally , present our conclusions in section  6 . in this work , we use a standard cdm cosmology with @xmath20  =  0.73 , @xmath21  =  0.27 , and h@xmath22  = 70  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 ( komatsu et al . 2011 ) .",
    "therefore 1  arcsec corresponds to about 7.1  kpc at the redshift of the quasar ( @xmath13  =  3.1875 see below ) . in the following",
    "we will use solar metallicities from asplund et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the quasar sdss  j0823@xmath120529 was observed with the magellan echellete spectrograph ( mage ; marshall et al .",
    "2008 ) mounted on the 6.5  m clay telescope located at las campanas observatory .",
    "mage is a medium - resolution long - slit spectrograph that covers the full wavelength range of the visible spectrum ( 3200  @xmath23  @xmath24  1  @xmath25  m ) .",
    "its 10  arcsec long slit and 0.30@xmath26 per pixel sampling in the spatial direction , are ideal for observing high - redshift extended astrophysical objects . the spectrograph was designed to have high throughput in the blue , with the peak throughput reaching 22  @xmath27 at 5600  @xmath23 including the telescope .",
    "the quasar was observed in december 2012 with an one arcsec width slit aligned along two different position angles ( pas ) for 1  hour each .",
    "one position was south - north ( pa  =  0 ) and the other position was east - west ( pa  =  90 ) .",
    "another 1-hour exposure with pa  =  90   was taken in february 2013 but the resultant spectrum has a lower snr . following each exposure ,",
    "the spectrum of a standard star was also recorded allowing us to precisely flux - calibrate the quasar spectra .",
    "the seeing , measured on the extracted trace of the quasar is 1.06  arcsec for pa  =  0 and 0.93  arcsec for pa  =  90 .",
    "we reduced the spectrum using the mage_reduce pipeline written in the interactive data language ( idl ) by george becker .",
    "in addition to the 1-dimensional ( 1d ) spectrum , the pipeline provides 2-dimensional ( 2d ) sky - subtracted science frames as well as the corresponding 2d wavelength solution corrected for the vacuum heliocentric velocity shifts .",
    "these 2d images will later be used to rectify the curved spectral orders ( see below ) . here , we note that since there is an extended lyman-@xmath2 emission in order 9 of our 2d spectra , we preferentially used a wider extraction window to extract this order .",
    "two - dimensional spectra when imaged onto a detector are often curved with respect to the natural ( x , y)-coordinate system of the detector defined by the ccd columns ( kelson 2003 ) . to rectify the curvature of the orders we first rebin the wavelength area ( given by the 2d wavelength solution ) and position area ( given by the 2d slitgrid array provided by the pipeline ) increasing the number of pixel by a factor of hundred .",
    "we define a new 2d array , with one dimension representing the wavelength ( @xmath14 ) and the other the position on the slit ( @xmath28 ) . for each pixel on the 2d spectrum of the quasar ,",
    "we take its corresponding wavelength and its position on the slit directly in the rebinned 2d areas . therefore , the ( x , y ) coordinates of each pixel ( defined by the ccd columns ) can now be transformed to an ( @xmath28 , @xmath14 ) coordinate defined by the new 2d array introduced above . in this new",
    "( @xmath28 , @xmath14)-coordinate system , the curvature of the orders and the tilting of the spectral lines are all rectified . in this study , we use these rectified 2d images when we discuss the spatial extension of the lyman-@xmath2 emission line in the quasar spectrum . note that the rebinning process has very little effect on the lyman-@xmath2 emission because it is conveniently placed in the middle of the corresponding order where curvature is at minimum .",
    "finally , the extracted 1d spectrum of each individual order is corrected for the relative spectral response of the instrument and flux - calibrated using the spectrum of a standard star ( hr  1544 ) observed during the same night .",
    "the spectrum of the standard star can be found in the eso standard star catalogue webpage .",
    "we emphasize that our standard star spectrum was obtained immediately after observing the quasar spectrum .",
    "we also flux calibrated in the same way the 2d spectra in the lyman-@xmath2 range .",
    "these flux - calibrated spectra are then combined weighting each pixel by the inverse of its variance .",
    "the resulting spectrum ( after binning with a 3  @xmath29  3 box ) has @xmath1  27  km  s@xmath11 per pixel and 3 pixels per resolution element , and therefore fwhm  @xmath1  80  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "we have fitted the quasar c  iv emission line with two gaussian functions ( to mimic the two lines of the doublet ) to estimate the redshift of the quasar .",
    "we derive @xmath30  =  3.1875 .",
    "this is @xmath1330  km  s@xmath11 smaller than the redshift of the dla ( @xmath31  =  3.1910 derived from the fit of si  ii and fe  ii absorptions ) .",
    "however , it is well known that redshifts from c  iv are smaller by up to 600  km  s@xmath11 compared to redshifts from narrow forbidden lines ( e.g. hewett & wild 2010 )",
    ". therefore we can not be certain that the dla is redshifted compared to the quasar .",
    "we would need to detect [ oiii ] lines redshifted to the infra - red to have a better estimate of @xmath30 .",
    "figure  [ qso_whole_spect ] shows the co - added spectrum of sdss  j0823 + 0529 using all the exposures taken at different pas .",
    "it is apparent that a strong dla is located close to the redshift of the quasar .",
    "however , strong lyman-@xmath2 emission is present in the center of the dla trough .",
    "this is possible if the absorbing cloud has a transverse extension which is smaller than the central narrow line region ( nlr ) of the quasar .",
    "note that the strength of the lyman-@xmath2 emission together with the size of the cloud derived below makes it very improbable that the lyman-@xmath2 emission could be a consequence of star formation in the dla itself .",
    "the redshift of the dla ( @xmath32  =  3.1910 ) was determined by conducting a simultaneous voigt profile fit of the fe  ii , si  ii@xmath33 , and o  i@xmath5 absorption profiles .",
    "a voigt profile fit was conducted on the damped lyman-@xmath2 absorption line of this system , resulting in a neutral hydrogen column density of log  @xmath34  =  21.70  @xmath35  0.10 .",
    "note that the placement of the quasar continuum is very uncertain as the dla covers the lyman-@xmath2 and the n  v broad emission lines .",
    "however , the core and especially the red wing of the dla profile allowed us to satisfactorily constrain the h  i column density . we will come back to this in section  3.4 .",
    "we detect absorption lines from o  i , o  i@xmath5 , si  ii , si  ii@xmath4 , fe  ii , al  ii , al  iii , ar  i , c  ii , c  ii@xmath33 , c  iv , si  iv , p  v and n  v. absorption profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ j08231d ] and results from fitting these lines are given in tables  [ lowion ]  @xmath36  [ hiion ] .",
    "techniques used here are similar to those in fathivavsari et al ( 2013 ) .",
    "it must be noted that most of the lines are saturated , preventing us from deriving accurate column densities especially at the resolution of our data ( r@xmath14000 ) .",
    "the profiles are dominated by a main strong component clearly seen in particular in fe  ii@xmath141608 and si  ii@xmath4@xmath141533 . to constrain the doppler parameter of this component ,",
    "we take advantage of the fact that fe  ii@xmath141608 is not saturated and well defined while fe  ii@xmath141611 is not detected ( see fig  [ dopplerb ] ) .",
    "we start by fitting together si  ii@xmath141808 and 1526 , imposing the presence of the main component with a fixed doppler parameter .",
    "we then use the resulting decomposition to fit the fe  ii lines .",
    "results are shown in fig  [ dopplerb ] for @xmath37  =  10 and 20 km / s .",
    "it is apparent that components narrower than @xmath37  @xmath1  20  km / s are not favored and @xmath37  =  10  km / s is definitely rejected .",
    "therefore , we are confident that imposing @xmath37",
    "@xmath1  20  km / s for the main component in the dla will give us a good estimate of column densities .",
    "for some of the species , several lines with very different oscillator strengths ( either in doublets or multiplets ) are present so that we can derive robust estimates of the column densities .",
    "this is the case for si  ii , si  ii@xmath33 , and fe  ii . from this , we derive metallicities relative to solar , [ si / h ]  =  @xmath240.79 and [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath241.87 .",
    "we also derive an upper limit on @xmath3(fe  iii ) .",
    "we also fit the high - ionization species .",
    "we did not try to tie the components in different profiles because this high - ionization phase could be highly perturbed . in table",
    "[ hiion ] , except for the first two components of the c  iv absorption profiles , all reported column densities are upper limits because the profiles are strongly saturated .",
    "it can be seen however that the decompositions in sub - components are fairly consistent between the different species .",
    "we detect absorptions from o  i@xmath5 and si  ii@xmath33 which are rarely detected in dlas ( see noterdaeme et al .",
    "2015 , neeleman et al . 2015 ) and are more commonly seen in dlas associated to grb afterglows ( vreeswijk et al .",
    "2004 ; chen et al . 2005",
    "; fynbo et al .",
    "absorption from the fine structure state of si  ii will be used to constrain the density of the absorbing cloud ( see below ) .",
    "the high measured depletion of iron relative to silicon ( i.e. [ si / fe ]  =  + 1.08 ) in this dla suggests the presence of dust .",
    "consequently , extinction due to dust might be significant along this line of sight .",
    "indeed , the median g  @xmath24  r color for a sample of 697 non - bal quasars with redshift within @xmath38@xmath13  =  @xmath350.02 around @xmath30  =  3.1910 is @xmath39  =  0.30 when @xmath40  =  1.1 for qso j0823 + 0529 .",
    "the reddening for this line of sight is e(b - v ) = 0.09 , measured with an smc reddening law template , which places it among the most reddened of the sight lines in the finley et al .",
    "( 2013 ) statistical sample .",
    "we will take this reddening into account in the following while discussing the properties of the quasar .",
    "in this section we use the photo - ionization code cloudy to constrain the ionization state of the absorber and its distance to the quasar central engine . observed ionic ratios of si  ii , si  iv , al  iii , and ar  i are used to constrain the plane parallel models constructed for a range of ionization parameters .",
    "the calculations were stopped when a neutral hydrogen column density of log  @xmath3(h  i )  =  21.70 is reached .",

    ". there are two notable features in the spatial and velocity structure of the nebula .",
    "first , in the north - west direction , the kinematics are strikingly similar along the trace and 10  kpc away from the center ( see fig .  13 ) with a velocity spread of more than 1000  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the emission is quite strong in this region .",
    "secondly , there is a clear gradient of about 1000  km  s@xmath11 between 15  kpc to the east and 20  kpc to the west .",
    "it is tempting to interpret these features as the superposition of the emission of gas in the disk of the galaxy , where the density is higher and turbulent kinematics prevent gas clouds to be well organized with emission from gas flowing out of the disk with velocities of the order of 500  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this gas is best seen up to 20  kpc to the west and 10  kpc to the east .",
    "such winds can be reproduced by recent models taking into account the effects of radiation trapping ( ishibashi & fabian 2015 ) .",
    "it is well demonstrated that bright quasars are surrounded by large amounts of gas both in extended ionized halos up to 10  mpc from the quasar ( e.g. rollinde et al . 2005 ) and extended ( 300  kpc ) reservoirs of neutral gas in the halo of the host galaxy ( prochaska et al .",
    "2013 , 2014 ; johnson et al .",
    "2015 ) . however , along the line of sight to quasars , the incidence of neutral gas is less ( e.g. shen & mnard 2012 ) indicating that the ionizing emission from quasars is highly anisotropic .",
    "the dla we discuss here is part of the so - called proximate dlas in the sense that the absorption redshift is similar to that of the quasar ( @xmath52  @xmath1  z@xmath53 , see e.g. ellison et al .",
    "2010 ) . however , this is the first time it can be demonstrated that the gas is located very close to the quasar ( @xmath6  400  pc ) and probably associated with the central part of the host galaxy .",
    "we have modelled the physical state of the gas in the dla using photo - ionization models .",
    "the ionization parameter is found to be in the range @xmath54  @xmath6  log@xmath55  @xmath6  @xmath56 which means that the cloud is mostly highly ionized .",
    "a density of @xmath57  @xmath1  710 - 180  @xmath8 is needed to explain the absorption lines from o  i and si  ii ground state excited levels implying that the neutral phase should have dimensions of the order of 2 to 9  pc and be embedded in an ionized cloud of size @xmath13 - 80  pc . from this , we could derive that the cloud is located between 230 and 580  pc from the quasar .",
    "the metallicity of the cloud , @xmath58  =  0.16  @xmath59 , is typical of the metallicity of standard intervening dlas ( rafelski et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "c    it is intriguing to note that the high - ionization phase of the cloud we see has characteristics similar to those of some of the warm absorbers seen in many agns .",
    "tombesi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) argued that warm absorbers ( wa ) and ultra - fast outflows ( ufo ) could represent parts of a single large - scale stratified outflow observed at different locations from the black hole .",
    "the ufos are likely launched from the inner accretion disc and the was at larger distances , such as the outer disc and/or torus .",
    "there are still significant uncertainties on the exact location of this material , which ranges from a few pc up to kpc scales , ( e.g. krolik & kriss 2001 ; blustin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the absorption lines are systematically blue - shifted , indicating outflow velocities of the was in the range 100 - 1000 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "king & pounds ( 2013 ) have argued that the dense gas which surrounds the agn when it starts shining is swept out by the fast winds powered by the accretion luminosity .",
    "the wind is halted by collisions near the radius where radiation pressure drops .",
    "the shocked gas must rapidly cool and mix with the swept - up ism .",
    "distance from the agn and properties of the gas are similar to what is observed for warm - absorbers , as in our case . therefore ,",
    "in qso  j0843 + 0529 , the dla could be located in the galactic disk at the terminal position of the wind , at the limit of the interstellar medium of the host galaxy .",
    "the presence of dust in the gas can be considered as supporting this view as it is expected in the dense environment of agns ( see e.g. leighly et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "c c    the only caveat with this idea is that the metallicity of the dla is typical of intervening dlas , when we would expect the gas in the ism of the quasar host galaxy to have larger metallicity .",
    "this , together with the low outflow velocity ( the dla is centered on the lyman-@xmath2 emission ) , argues for another explanation for the origin of this gas .",
    "given the distance to the central agn ( 230  @xmath6  @xmath10  @xmath6  580  pc ) , one is tempted to conjecture that it could be the final fate of infalling gas .",
    "note that in that case , the presence of dust is not a problem as the observed amount is not unusual compared to what is seen in typical high column density dlas .",
    "indeed , accretion is believed to happen through cold flows which are expected to be of lower metallicity compared to the environment of the quasar ( see bouch et al .",
    "little is known about how quasars at high redshift interact with cold infalling streams of gas , and in particular whether these collimated structures can survive the energy released by the agn .",
    "therefore the dla cloud could be in a transitory phase before it is completely destroyed by the agn ionizing radiation field ( namekata et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the two alternatives are actually not incompatible , since some of the warm absorbers could be part of the galactic ism swept away from the center by the agn and placed at large distances from the agn ( e.g. king & pounds 2013 ) .",
    "these outflowing warm absorbers may then intersect with accreted cold streams .",
    "there is little doubt that dlas acting as coronagraphs are important targets to be observed and analyzed .",
    "besides revealing interesting characteristics of the quasar host galaxy they are , like in qso j0823 + 0529 , potentially part of the machinery that power the agn .",
    "finley et al .",
    "( 2013 ) found 57 such systems out of about a third of the boss targets . with the on - going eboss - sdssiv survey and the forseen desi survey ( schlegel et al .",

    "<S> we report long - slit spectroscopic observations of the quasar sdss j082303.22 + 052907.6 ( @xmath0@xmath13.1875 ) , whose broad line region ( blr ) is partly eclipsed by a strong damped lyman-@xmath2 ( dla ; log@xmath3(hi)=21.7 ) cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to study the narrow line region ( nlr ) of the quasar and the lyman-@xmath2 emission from the host galaxy . using cloudy models that explain the presence of strong nv and pv absorption together with the detection of siii@xmath4 and oi@xmath5 absorption in the dla </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the density and the distance of the cloud to the quasar are in the ranges 180  @xmath6  @xmath7  @xmath6  710  @xmath8 and 580  @xmath9  @xmath10  @xmath9230  pc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> sizes of the neutral(@xmath12 - 9pc ) and highly ionized phases ( @xmath13 - 80pc ) are consistent with the partial coverage of the civ broad line region by the civ absorption from the dla ( covering factor of @xmath10.85 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the residuals are consistent with emission from the nlr with civ / lyman-@xmath2 ratios varying from 0 to 0.29 through the profile . remarkably , we detect extended lyman-@xmath2 emission up to 25kpc to the north and west directions and 15kpc to the south and east . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the emission as the superposition of strong emission in the plane of the galaxy up to 10kpc with emission in a wind of projected velocity @xmath1500 km  s@xmath11 which is seen up to 25kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the low metallicity of the dla ( 0.27 solar ) argues for at least part of this gas being in - falling towards the agn and possibly being located where accretion from cold streams ends up .    </S>",
