    "the generalization to an array of domain walls is straightforward . for @xmath232 successive domain walls , the josephson phase difference across the junction",
    "is given by @xmath233 where @xmath171 depends on the configuration @xmath234 of all domain walls .",

    "the randomness occurs in the positions of domain walls as well as in the sequence of @xmath249 .",
    "the deviation from the standard fraunhofer pattern is obvious .",
    "however , the maximum of the josephson current lies rather close to @xmath250 .",
    "this feature has to do with the fact that , in the case of generic random configurations , the phase shift does not vary much overall , i.e. @xmath251 . stronger deviations can be observed , if we bias the domain wall configuration in a way as to have a larger net shift , e.g. by assuming for all domain walls the same sign of @xmath187 .    .",
    "the anisotropy parameter is chosen @xmath252 @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite . ]      an important feature supporting the idea that domain walls are involved in producing the irregular interference pattern is the observation of hysteresis effects by kidwingira _",
    "et al _ , when the external magnetic field was cycled between positive and negative maximal fields @xcite .",
    "they argued that the applied magnetic field induces a rearrangement of the domain walls in the sample , and they substantiated their claim by simulations looking at the effect of shifted domain wall positions . since the domain walls are pinned at defects of the sample large shifts in positions are rather unlikely .",
    "hysteresis effects are rather easily discussed within our simplified model in eq.([model-1 ] , [ model-2 ] , [ model-3 ] ) .",
    "the free energy of the junction in a magnetic field can be approximated by @xmath253 we neglect the change of the intersection points @xmath254 for different configurations @xmath255 and examine the condition to minimize the free energy .",

    "@xmath259 the free energy in eq.([fen ] ) can be lowered by choosing @xmath260 , because under this condition @xmath261 note that there are special values of @xmath262 where the full  polarization  of @xmath187 may not be the best choice . however , considering a sweep of the field to maximal value @xmath263 and back would favor eq.([polar - phi ] ) .",
    "the same argument can be used for negative fluxes , driving the domain walls to adopt @xmath264 . note that for metastable domain wall states a  polarization  would only be possible , if the energy expense of the metastable configurations is sufficiently small .",
    "we consider now geometries for which this is true .",
    "starting at zero field , the domain walls shall be essentially randomly configured .",
    "such a situation would lead to a critical current pattern as shown in fig .",
    "[ imax_06m2 ] .",
    "if the magnetic field is increased up to a sufficiently high value , then the domain walls would likely polarize after a certain waiting time .",
    "when we decrease now the field to measure the interference pattern , we observe the interference pattern modified by the polarized domain walls .",
    "after reaching a sufficiently large negative field value , the domain walls polarize in the opposite way .",
    "therefore , tuning the field back towards positive values we find an altered interference pattern of the critical current .",
    "simulation results taking the two ( polarized ) domain wall configurations into account are shown in fig.[imax_06mrl ] .",
    "the most striking feature is the shift of the maximum of the critical current .",
    "these curves are obtained assuming that changes of domain wall configurations during the field sweep , when the critical currents is measured , can be neglected .",
    "reorganizations of the domain wall configurations during the field sweep would most likely lead to discontinuities in the critical current .",
    "this kind of behavior is also observed in a set of measurements by kidwingira et al ( fig.3b in @xcite ) where the field sweeping range is restricted to rather small fields only .",
    "also in this case a hysteretic behavior of critical current ( dependence on the field sweep direction ) was observed , though less pronounced .",
    "it is not unlikely that some part of the noise on these data can be interpreted as an effect due to the domain walls .        turning back to the hysteresis effect with polarized domain wall configurations",
    ", we might use the shift of the position of the maximal critical current in order to estimate the density of domain walls .",
    "we denote the flux of the maximal current as @xmath265 which can be determined approximately by the condition @xmath266 assuming for the last equality a completely polarized domain wall configuration where all domain walls contribute the same phase shift @xmath187 .",
    "first , we conclude that the maximum lies at @xmath267 for a sweep down from the positive field side ( opposite for the opposite sweep direction ) in accordance with experimental findings @xcite . the number of domain walls intersecting the josephson junction is then given by @xmath268 kidwingira et al find in a measurement of hysteresis effect the magnetic field @xmath269 ( fig.3a in @xcite ) which yields a flux @xmath270 .",

    "kidwingira et al also report the presence of peculiar noise in the time dependence of the voltage drop of the junction in a constant current slightly above the critical current @xcite .",
    "the question arises whether this feature can also be attributed to the dynamics of domain walls .",
    "as we have seen above , the modification of the domain wall configuration @xmath281 changes the critical current .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics of a josephson junction for currents @xmath181 immediately above the critical current @xmath282 is very non - linear .",
    "the standard textbook form of the current - voltage relation of a josephson junction gives usually a good approximation of the general behavior @xmath283 for @xmath284 .",
    "for a given current @xmath181 the time dependence of the critical current , @xmath285 leads to @xmath286 which can be large for @xmath181 close to @xmath287 .",
    "the reported noise feature ( fig.3d of @xcite ) suggest that the critical current fluctuates between two values , which could correspond to two domain wall configurations ( see .",
    "fig.[iv ] ) .     and @xmath288 which for the same applied current lead to different values of the voltage on the junction , @xmath289 and @xmath290 , respectively .",
    "a time sequence of changing between the two critical current values ( by change of domain wall configurations ) gives rise to steplike noise on the voltage signal . ]",
    "our theoretical discussion of the interference pattern did not include the faceting of the interface between the @xmath16-wave superconductor and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "the effect of faceting is two - fold .",
    "first , a faceted surface can lead to additional stable and metastable domain wall configurations as domain walls can be pinned at surface inhomogeneities .",
    "thus , they add to the number of possible junction states .",
    "second , faceting corresponds to a varying interface normal vector .",
    "it is easy to see that the modulation of the inplane normal vector angle @xmath59 by @xmath291 corresponds directly to the josephson phase variation @xmath292 ( @xmath293 ) , if the length scale of the faceting is larger than the coherence length of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ( @xmath294 ) . as a random phase modulation of this kind with @xmath295",
    "does not lead to a significant shift of the maximal critical current in the interference pattern and no hysteretic effect is possible , faceting alone can not be responsible for the features observed . together with a spatial variation of the josephson coupling the variation of the phase due to faceting can contribute to the static random structure of the interference pattern .",
    "fine structures in the interference pattern ( variations of the critical current on small field changes ) are usually due to variation on long length scales along the junction and are also known for conventional josephson contacts . note that the effect of faceting in @xmath296-wave high - temperature superconductors has a stronger impact on the interference pattern , since the phase jumps between 0 and @xmath297 can lead to phase wandering along the junction such that @xmath298 and produces a field shift for the maximal josephson current , as observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "for completeness we address here a further interesting feature connected with a domain wall intersecting the interface .",
    "this time , however , we change to limit of @xmath299 being much shorter than the extension of the junction . in order to describe the behavior of the phase @xmath161",
    ", we have then to solve the sine - gordon equation @xmath300 the solution here has a kink shape which is slightly modified by the last term of the right - hand side .",
    "this term acts like a source term in the vicinity of the domain wall . without explicitly writing down the solution",
    "it is clear that within the length scale of @xmath299 from the domain wall @xmath171 approaches a constant value . as discussed earlier the derivative @xmath301 corresponds to a local magnetic field , such that here a well - localized magnetic flux line appears at the position where the domain wall meets the interface .",
    "the enclosed magnetic flux can be easily determined by @xmath302dy\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_{-l/2}^{l/2}\\frac{\\phi_0}{2\\pi}\\left(\\partial_y\\varphi(y)-\\partial_y\\phi(y)\\right)dy\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx&\\frac{\\phi_0}{2\\pi}n2\\pi-\\frac{\\phi_0}{2\\pi}\\delta\\phi \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath303 is a positive integer .",
    "we finally see that the minimal possible fluxes is given by @xmath304 since @xmath305 , we encounter here fractional vortices which are generally a sign of broken time reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the detection of such well - localized fluxes could be used to detect the position of domain walls .",
    "motivated by the experiments of kidwingira et al . on josephson junctions between sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and the conventional superconductor pb @xcite , we studied effect of domain walls on the josephson interference effect in a magnetic field assuming that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is a chiral @xmath2-wave superconductor . for this purpose",
    "we analyzed the domain wall structure and showed that its internal phase structure is crucial for the josephson effect , if domain walls intersect the josephson junction .",
    "the anisotropy of the electronic band structure plays an important role , as it influences the phase shift of the superconducting order parameter between the two types of chiral domains .",
    "in addition , it determines the energetically most favorable orientation of the domain wall .",
    "the theory presented here is able to explain the most important features reported by kidwingira et al @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) the interference pattern in a single junction deviates from the the standard fraunhofer pattern not only through irregularities , but also shows a distinct asymmetry between positive and negative magnetic fields and the maximum of the critical current can be shifted away from zero field .",
    "this can be attributed to the phase shifts introduced by domain walls intersecting the interface between sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and the conventional superconductor .",
    "( 2 ) kidwingira et al report strong differences between the interference pattern of different samples .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that the samples were prepared in different ways , with possibly also different normal vector directions as well as different degrees of faceting .",
    "( 3 ) cycling the field continuously covering a positive and negative field range , a hysteretic behavior in the interference pattern appears which can be understood as a field - driven motion of the domain walls , whereby the anisotropy of the domain wall energy could play an important role , as our model shows . allowing for the change of domain wall configurations in time we can also understand the noise effect seen in the current voltage measurements for currents above the critical current .",
    "the question arises whether it would be possible to test the domain wall scenario by generating a single - domain superconducting phase in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "this would be most straightforwardly realized by field - cooling .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure might lead to vortex trapping in both superconductors which would jeopardize a clear outcome . domains naturally arise in the zero - field cooling process , as superconductivity nucleates in the sample with some extent of inhomogeneity , since the chiral @xmath2-wave state is rather susceptible to disorder effects . in this way",
    "both chiral states can emerge in the sample in different regions and the domain walls appearing between them are eventually pinned in the sample , making it difficult to anneal the sample to a domain wall free phase .",
    "it is difficult to estimate a priori the density of domain walls .",
    "however , our analysis suggests that domain walls intersecting the josephson junctions in the experiment may be separated by a few micrometers which is considerably larger than the extension of the domain walls .",
    "this estimate may be interesting in the context of recent measurements by kirtley et al aiming at the observation of spontaneous magnetic flux at surfaces of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , as expected for chiral @xmath2-wave states @xcite .",
    "since these experiments gave a negative result for the presence of such fluxes , it was speculated that the dense population of chiral domains would cancel out the signal for the scanning squid microscope used .",
    "our estimate of domain wall density corresponds roughly to the spatial resolution of the squid microscope .",
    "thus it remains unclear whether domain walls really could explain the absence of a positive signal from spontaneous flux .",
    "extensive theoretical studies on this issue point to an important puzzle in this context @xcite .    eventually , we would like to note that this experiment does not decide between even- or odd - parity pairing .",
    "while the experimental situation satisfies the selection rules for the coupling between the chiral @xmath2-wave and an @xmath16-wave superconductor , the effects observed in the josephson interference experiments would be similar for a chiral @xmath296-wave superconductor such as the @xmath306-wave state belonging to @xmath307-representation of the tetragonal point group @xmath30 , for which , however , additional complications appear due to the nodal gap structure . at the present stage ,",
