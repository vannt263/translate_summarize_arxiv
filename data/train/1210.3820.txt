    "vortices , to move , need to change polarization as they are attracted to the polarization clouds induced at their previous positions . due to nonzero magnetic relaxation time vortex viscosity",
    "is enhanced and this enhancement increases with magnetic relaxation time .",
    "vortex together with accompanied nonuniform polarization form vortex polaron at low vortex velocity . as bias current and lorentz force increase so does vortex velocity and above some critical velocity vortices get rid of polarization and move at higher velocities defined by usual bardeen - stephen drag coefficient . at this polaron",
    "dissociation voltage jumps to higher value and from the point of view of i - v characteristics corresponding bias current may be identified as the critical current .",
    "when pinning due to defects presents , vortices start to move with enhanced viscosity and low dissipation above the critical current , determined by the pinning due to defects . then above the dissociation",

    "the polaronic mechanism constraining vortex motion is effective not only in crystals , but in multilayered systems of superconductor and magnetic layers whose thickness is smaller or of the order of the superconducting penetration depth @xmath4 , see ref .  .    the polaronic mechanism is inherent to any magnetic superconductor , but the strength of magnetic coupling of vortex with magnetic moments depends crucially on the london penetration length which determines nonuniform part of the magnetic field inside superconductors .",
    "the interaction drops as @xmath5 as @xmath4 increases and thus polaronic mechanism is most effective in superconductors with low @xmath4 s like borocarbides where @xmath4 is of the order 500 @xmath6 .",
    "another important parameter is the magnetic susceptibility @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the magnetization ) at the operating applied magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "finally the third crucial parameter in slowing down vortex motion is the relaxation time @xmath10 of the magnetic moments .    in this paper",
    "we consider vortex motion in the presence of the alternating in time lorentz force and show that the polaronic effect results in suppression of vortex oscillations and , consequently , dissipation .",
    "we consider also thermally activated vortex motion via the potential barrier inherent to vortex creep at low temperatures in the andersen - kim model .",
    "we show that creep rate is also suppressed by the polaronic effect resulting in lower dissipation at low temperatures .",
    "we predict that a strong ac lorentz force with frequency @xmath11 results in vortex lattice oscillations with the frequency @xmath12 just after polaron dissociation due to retardation in response of magnetic moments to the inhomogeneous magnetic field of moving vortex lattice .",

    "at frequencies @xmath111 , during the period of @xmath112 , we see the following sequence of events : polaron formation near low @xmath113 ( interval of low vortex velocity ) , then polaron dissociation ( velocity sharp increase ) followed by region of vortex oscillations on the background of average high velocity , decrease of velocity as the lorentz force drops and vortex retrapping ( sharp drop in vortex velocity ) and then dissociation again at negative @xmath114 ( sharp drop in velocity ) .",
    "the results for behavior of vortex velocity in time , @xmath115 , at @xmath116 and different @xmath2 are shown in fig .  [ f4 ] .",
