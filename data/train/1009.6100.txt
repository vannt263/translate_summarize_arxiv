    "the effective field theory ( eft ) formulation of nuclear forces  @xcite tries to provide a consistent understanding of nuclear physics in terms of chiral symmetry , the main low energy manifestation of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the applicability of eft techniques relies on the existence of a separation of scales in the nuclear force : the long distance physics is known to be dominated by pion exchanges ( see for example  @xcite for a demonstration ) , which in turn are constrained by the requirements of chiral symmetry . on the contrary , the nature of the interaction at short distances is poorly understood , and has been traditionally treated in a purely phenomenological manner .",
    "however , the specific parametrization used for the short range physics is inessential for the description of low energy phenomena .    in weinberg s original formulation  @xcite , which represents the first proposal for constructing an eft of nuclear forces",
    ", the nuclear potential is expanded as a power series ( or power counting ) in terms of the low energy scales of the system , such as the pion mass or the nucleon momentum .",
    "the resulting chiral potential is inserted into the schrdinger or lippmann - schwinger equation , from which wave functions and observables can be computed .",
    "this prescription takes into account the non - perturbative nature of nuclear forces and fits naturally into the traditional paradigm of nuclear physics .",
    "the weinberg approach is phenomenologically very successful , as exemplified by the @xmath0 calculations of refs .  @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , however , the previous calculations are rather unsatisfactory in the sense that the cut - off is fined tuned inside a narrow window .",
    "we expect any eft calculation to be fairly cut - off independent , a prospect which has encouraged the search for alternatives to weinberg , like the ksw counting  @xcite , or , more recently , non - perturbative renormalization  @xcite . although the requirement of renormalizability has been put in question in  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a balanced discussion on the merits and disadvantages of the different approaches ) , we will show here that cut - off dependence is not the only problem that affects the weinberg scheme .    in this contribution we will implement the power counting proposal of nogga , timmermans and van kolck ( ntvk )  @xcite at next - to - leading and next - to - next - to - leading order  @xcite . in this approach , the leading order piece of the chiral nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction , one pion exchange , is iterated to all orders and renormalized , a requisite which implies the modification of the power counting for certain short range operators .",
    "the subleading pieces of the interaction are treated in perturbation theory , and as we will show for the particular case of the singlet channel , cut - off independence induces further modifications to the power counting  @xcite which were not present in the original weinberg formulation .",
    "these modifications are compatible with the renormalization group analysis of the ntvk counting made by birse  @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the role of the cut - off and the possible interpretation of regularization and renormalization in eft .",
    "in weinberg s power counting  @xcite , the nn potential is described as a low energy expansion in terms of a ratio of scales , @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents the low energy scales of the system , such as the pion mass @xmath4 or the momentum of the nucleons @xmath5 , and @xmath6 represents the high energy scales of the system , like the nucleon mass @xmath7 or the rho mass @xmath8 .",
    "the rules by which a certain operator or diagram is assigned a given power of @xmath1 are called a power counting : in weinberg s proposal it is implicitly assumed that naive dimensional analysis provides a good power counting for the nn potential .",
    "the potential is expected to be iterated at all orders in the schrdinger or lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the organization of the chiral potential is as follows : at order @xmath9 or leading order ( @xmath10 ) the potential consists on one pion exchange ( ope ) and two contact interactions . at order @xmath11 or next - to - leading order ( @xmath12 ) , leading chiral two pion exchange ( tpe ) and seven derivative contact terms are added . at order @xmath13 or next - to - next - to - leading order ( @xmath14 ) subleading two",
