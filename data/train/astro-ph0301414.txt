    "maffei  1 is a large elliptical galaxy located in the middle of the zone of avoidance ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "unfortunately , elucidation of its fundamental properties , such as the absolute magnitude and distance , has been hampered by both its size and location . not only is it covered with myriads of foreground stars , but it also suffers from about 5 magnitudes of extinction in @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in distance is especially problematic given that it is positioned in the general direction of the andromeda galaxy .",
    "past work has led to the suggestion that the galaxy is near enough and moving fast enough to have been in proximity to m31 in the past 5 to 8 billion years @xcite .",
    "if so , it could have influenced the motions of galaxies in the local group , thereby invalidating the binary hypothesis of local group timing @xcite .",
    "owing to the heavy obscuration , the existence of maffei  1 was unknown until 1968 , when paolo maffei discovered it on i - n and ia - e plates acquired with the schmidt telescope at asiago observatory during a search for t  tauri stars and diffuse nebulae @xcite .",
    "the subsequent flurry of research activity led to its tentative identification as an elliptical galaxy @xcite , later confirmed by @xcite and @xcite . by comparing the nuclear spectrum with spectra of the spheroid of m31 and giant ellipticals like ngc  3379",
    ", @xcite estimated @xmath23 to be @xmath24 . upon visual inspection of a photographic spectrum",
    ", it was concluded that the velocity dispersion was `` not less than @xmath25 or greater than @xmath26 '' ; a value of @xmath27 was adopted .",
    "combined with a measurement of the core radius , an inferred total magnitude ( @xmath28 in @xmath22 ) corrected for the extinction , and an assumed mass - to - light ratio , the distance was evaluated to be 1 mpc .",
    "consequently , it was suggested that maffei  1 might be an unbound member of the local group .",
    "certainly , the galaxy appeared to be the nearest giant elliptical .",
    "subsequent estimates of extinction based upon studies of foreground stars indicated that the result of @xcite might be a magnitude or more too high ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite added two new measurements .",
    "first , by measuring the @xmath29 colour of the inner region via aperture photometry , and comparing it with the mean colour of unobscured ellipticals , @xmath23 was estimated to be @xmath30 .",
    "also , from the total column density of gas in the direction of the galaxy , judged from both hi and co measurements , @xmath23 was estimated to be @xmath31 .",
    "determinations based upon analyses of foreground stars were clearly underestimates .",
    "@xcite concluded that @xmath32 . through a gross extrapolation of the aperture growth curve ,",
    "the apparent visual magnitude was determined to be @xmath33 . combining the velocity dispersion estimated by @xcite with the measurements of extinction and brightness ,",
    "a distance of @xmath34 was derived from the relationship between luminosity and central velocity dispersion observed in @xmath22 for elliptical galaxies , as defined by @xcite .",
    "thus , the galaxy no longer appeared to be in the local group , but instead in a collection of galaxies known at the time as the ursa major - camelopardalis cloud @xcite .    in an effort to derive a better estimate of the distance",
    ", @xcite examined surface brightness fluctuations in @xmath15 out to a radius of @xmath35 . using m32 and the spheroid of m31 as references",
    ", they concluded that the distance was @xmath36 . in principle , this was the best determination of distance yet . however , there were still reasons for caution , because of the possibility that the measurement of the fluctuation magnitude was compromised by contamination of the field by faint foreground stars , globular clusters in maffei  1 itself , and variations in the galaxy - subtracted background introduced by the known dust lanes .",
    "an even more fundamental question is whether the mix of giants in maffei  1 responsible for the surface brightness fluctuations at @xmath15 is similar to that in either of the reference fields .",
    "one argument against this is that the fluctuation magnitude for m32 was measured to be brighter than that for m31 by @xmath37 .",
    "also , @xcite found that the @xmath15 luminosity functions of agb stars in m31 and m32 are intrinsically different , despite the agreement in the magnitudes of their respective agb tips .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite assumed that m31 and m32 are equidistant .",
    "if in fact the stellar mixes were identical , then surface brightness fluctuations in @xmath7 would suggest that m32 is farther away than m31 by @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated convincingly from studies of the reddening of planetary nebulae in m32 that m32 is in front of m31 @xcite . by studying the gravitational influence of m32 on the disk of m31",
    ", @xcite concluded that m32 is only @xmath39 , or @xmath40 , nearer than the nucleus of m31 .",
    "thus , the discrepancy in the fluctuation magnitudes of these two galaxies can not be attributed to a distance effect alone .",
    "another problem with @xmath15 surface brightness fluctuations in maffei  1 is the observation that the fluctuation magnitude brightens by @xmath41 over the small range of radii studied ( 35% of the length of the semimajor axis of the effective isophote in @xmath7 : @xcite ) . to account for this",
    ", @xcite assumed `` not without trepidation '' that the population of stars within @xmath42 was like that in m31 and that the mix from @xmath42 to @xmath35 was more like that in m32 .",
    "@xmath43 colours within the inner arcminute of m31 and m32 differ by @xmath44 @xcite , supporting the argument that different populations contribute to the surface brightness fluctuations observed in these galaxies .",
    "however , in maffei  1 , the photometry of @xcite reveals that both @xmath29 and @xmath1 change by only 0.13 mag between the two zones in question . in other words ,",
    "the stellar mix in maffei  1 is relatively homogeneous throughout the observed region , while there is evidence that the reference field assigned to the inner observed zone differs in stellar content from the reference field assigned to the outer observed zone",
    ". the origin of some of the brightening in the fluctuation magnitude with radius in maffei  1 may actually be globular clusters , because @xcite have identified 12 candidates between @xmath45 and @xmath35 in images acquired with hst . the more reliable determination of distance , then , might be the comparison of fluctuations within @xmath42 of the nucleus with those observed in the bulge of m31 .",
    "however , although the mean absolute magnitude of @xmath15 fluctuations seen in virgo cluster ellipticals agrees with the value adopted by @xcite for the bulge of m31 , the range for five galaxies with total intrinsic @xmath1 colours like that of maffei  1 is @xmath46 @xcite .    using adaptive optics at cfht",
    ", @xcite were actually able to measure @xmath15 magnitudes directly for the brightest agb stars in a @xmath47 field located @xmath48 from the centre of maffei  1 . interpreting the stars as being similar to the most luminous seen in the bulge of m31 , they estimated a distance of @xmath49 . although not entirely independent of the result of @xcite , the technique has the advantage that the luminosity of the brightest agb stars does not appear to vary much between m32 and the bulges of m31 and the milky way , supporting the adoption of the agb tip as a standard candle . however ,",
    "@xcite find a strong dependence of the luminosity of agb stars upon age . in ",
    "[ discussion ] , we examine how much the age dependency may extend the range in luminosity associated with the agb tip , and in turn , the effect on the distance to maffei  1 .",
    "@xcite also applied the @xmath10@xmath11 relation to arrive at an independent estimate of distance .",
    "the result , @xmath50 , agreed with that from surface brightness fluctuations , but the observational ingredients were highly uncertain , being founded upon their surface photometry in @xmath15 ( to only @xmath51 , i.e. , 30% of @xmath10 ) , an average @xmath52 colour for ellipticals , and the velocity dispersion of @xcite .",
    "the method is re - examined in   [ distance ] using modern data .",
    "distances derived from stars within maffei  1 do not directly give information about the luminosity of the galaxy without good integrated photometry .",
    "realizing that adequate photometry was lacking , @xcite acquired images of maffei  1 in @xmath14 , @xmath22 , and cousins @xmath7 using a ccd camera attached to the burrell schmidt telescope at kitt peak .",
    "after carefully removing foreground stars , the apparent @xmath22 magnitude was found to be @xmath53 , confirming the earlier results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "using the lower distance of @xcite , the absolute magnitude ( @xmath54 ) would make maffei  1 an intermediate elliptical by the standards of galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "using the larger distance of @xcite , maffei  1 would have a luminosity ( @xmath55 ) comparable to that of the brightest members of the cluster .    it is clear that there is a need to gauge the distance to maffei  1 in a new way . as it turns out , it is also necessary to re - evaluate the extinction .",
    "since 1983 , most authors have adopted the extinction to be that recommended by @xcite .",
    "it is behind all of the recent distance determinations described above .",
    "the map of extinction derived by @xcite from direct observations of dust emission can not be applied because it is uncalibrated at galactic latitudes below @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , nobody has actually measured the _ extinction _ of maffei  1 .",
    "rather , any evaluation of extinction has come from a measurement of the _ reddening _ , in combination with a reddening law and an assumption about the ratio of total to selective extinction , @xmath57 .",
    "it is well known that , as a consequence of shifts in effective wavelengths , the ratio of total to selective extinction for a star depends upon both the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the reddening .",
    "until recently , the subject had never been explored for galaxies , and even for stars it had really only been investigated thoroughly for @xmath14 and @xmath22 . @xcite and @xcite have shown that the ratio of total to selective extinction for galaxies does indeed vary with morphological type , reddening , and , especially , redshift .",
    "in fact , @xmath58 for a star - forming galaxy is different from that for a star of the same colour .    in evaluating the extinction in a particular passband ,",
    "most researchers use a colour excess , traditionally @xmath59 , and a reddening law , which gives the extinction as a function of wavelength , usually normalized to @xmath59 .",
    "there are two problems with this approach .",
    "first , the object used to gauge the colour excess does not always have the same spectrum as the object for which the extinction is desired .",
    "second , objects used to define the reddening law may be different altogether . even a so - called monochromatic reddening law may be normalized to a colour excess defined by broad - band filters , so the coefficients of the law remain object - dependent . thus , the derivation of an extinction of a source may be filled with inconsistencies . for example , a typical researcher might use the map of @xcite to gauge the extinction of a spiral galaxy .",
    "the maps are calibrated using estimates of @xmath59 for elliptical galaxies spread all over the sky ( with intrinsic colours judged from the @xmath0index ) .",
    "the conversion of colour excesses to extinction might be accomplished using the reddening law of @xcite , which specifically is founded upon studies of o and b stars . in the end , a colour index for elliptical galaxies is used with a reddening law for o and b stars to evaluate the extinction of a spiral galaxy !    as mentioned previously , @xcite gauged the colour excess of maffei  1 by two methods . the colour excess judged from the comparison of the apparent @xmath29 colour of the galaxy with the mean colour for ellipticals",
    "was converted into an extinction using @xmath60 , which was estimated from the intrinsic colour and colour excess via the relation derived by @xcite for stars .",
    "the colour excess judged from the column density of gas along the line of sight was founded upon a correlation observed for o and b stars in the milky way . in this case , @xmath23 was computed using @xmath61 , appropriate for those stars @xcite .",
    "this second estimate of @xmath23 really was applicable only to o and b stars , not to maffei  1 , or even to stars with the same colour as maffei  1",
    ".    for objects at high galactic latitudes , a small error in @xmath58 has rather insignificant consequences ( except for studies of large - scale flows : see @xcite ) . however , the error is amplified for heavily - obscured objects like maffei  1 . properly taking into account effective wavelength shifts @xcite",
    ", @xmath58 is 3.22 for an elliptical galaxy and 3.00 for a b0  v star , given that both are at rest and obscured comparably to maffei  1 .",
    "if one uses the colour excesses to solve for the optical depth along the line of sight at 1 @xmath62 ( see   [ s_exmaf1 ] ) , the colour of maffei  1 leads to an extinction of @xmath63 , which is @xmath44 lower than estimated by @xcite , and the column density of gas gives an extinction of @xmath64 , also @xmath44 lower .",
    "an additional reddening estimate was recently obtained by @xcite , who measured the mean @xmath65 colour of bright giants in maffei  1 and derived @xmath66 based on the assumption that the brightest stars have the same intrinsic colours as m giants in baade s window . following the procedure described in ",
    "[ s_exmaf1 ] , this colour excess leads to an extinction of @xmath67 in @xmath22 .",
    "in this paper , the extinction of maffei  1 is estimated with improved accuracy by measuring the @xmath0index for the first time , and by deriving a value for the ratio of total to selective extinction consistent with the sed , extinction , and redshift .",
    "then , the distance is determined for the first time from the fundamental plane using a modern measurement of the velocity dispersion in combination with the effective radius determined by @xcite from wide - field surface photometry .",
    "a new determination of the radial velocity is used to evaluate the degree to which maffei  1 departs from the hubble flow and the likelihood of any interaction with the local group subsequent to the big bang .",

    "[ observations ] , and reductions are outlined in   [ reductions ] .",

    "finally , the properties of maffei  1 are summarized in   [ summary ] .",
    "all spectroscopy of maffei  1 was carried out with the boller and chivens long - slit spectrograph attached to the @xmath68 focus of the @xmath69 telescope at the observatorio astronmico nacional in san pedro mrtir , baja california , mxico .",

    "the readout noise was @xmath72 , and the dark current was a negligible @xmath73 .",
    "the readout electronics did not permit overclocking the ccd , so frames did not include overscan pixels .",

    "one giant was observed twice to check repeatability .",
    "since the orientation of the slit was almost north - south ( the direction of atmospheric dispersion for maffei  1 ) , errors in tracking and guiding would have moved the stars perpendicular to the slit , in essence helping to fill the slit comparably to the nucleus of maffei  1 . after completing the observations , five dome flat field exposures were taken .",

    "since the standard deviation encompasses the uncertainty in the radial velocities of the template stars as well as the xcsao fitting uncertainty , whereas the least - squared error only reflects the latter , it is likely that the standard deviation is a more realistic estimate of the uncertainty .",

    "the large error bar is predominantly due to the uncertainty in the @xmath14-band photometry and extinction .",
    "a value of @xmath10 can be estimated as well from the @xmath15 photometry of @xcite , but using an actual measurement of @xmath269 now .",
    "the effective @xmath14 magnitude is given by @xcite , and the effective @xmath15 magnitude within the effective aperture defined for @xmath14 @xcite can be measured from the aperture growth curve of @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath270 colour is @xmath271mag , versus @xmath272 adopted by @xcite . from the @xmath15 surface brightness profile of @xcite , we measure @xmath263 @xmath273using the revised colour . performing the same analysis as above , we obtain a @xmath252 distance of @xmath13mpc .",
    "although distances determined from the brightest stars in @xmath15 are suspect , we have no grounds to reject the new values from the @xmath252 relation . consequently , the distance we adopt for maffei  1 is @xmath16mpc , which is the weighted average of the result from the fp and the mean of the two estimates from the @xmath252 relation .",
    "the error does not include that in the zero - point of the distance scale .",
    "it also does not include the uncertainty in the shape of the reddening law , but this is thought to be small in comparison to the error in the measurement of the extinction ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "to properly compare our result with the distance estimates of @xcite and @xcite derived from the brightest stars in @xmath15 , we revise their results using the galactic extinction of maffei  1 found in this study and our adopted distance scale anchored to the maser distance of ngc  4258 .",
    "the result of @xcite moves in from @xmath50 to @xmath274mpc , and the result of @xcite comes in from @xmath275 to @xmath276mpc .",
    "our new distance is significantly closer .    as stated in",
    "  [ intro ] , both of the @xmath15 analyses required the adoption of an intrinsic luminosity for the brightest giants in @xmath15 , which was judged from observations of m32 and the bulge of m31 .",
    "luminosities of stars at the tip of the agb are very sensitive to age @xcite ; over 214 gyr , @xmath277 becomes fainter by roughly @xmath278 .",
    "m32 is known to host a population of luminous agb stars , evidence of an episode of star formation in the last 2 gyr @xcite .",
    "the bulge of m31 may be similarly affected , given that the very brightest stars at @xmath15 have absolute magnitudes close to those in m32 @xcite . in maffei  1 , the lack of an unusually large colour gradient @xcite and the negligible h@xmath279  emission @xcite suggest that star formation has not occurred recently . consequently , it may be postulated that agb stars in maffei  1 are more likely to lie on the opposite end of the age scale from their counterparts in m31 and m32 . if the age of the brightest agb stars in maffei  1 were around 10 gyr , whereas the age of such stars in m32 and in the bulge of m31 were more like 2 to 4 gyr , absolute @xmath15 magnitudes would be fainter in maffei  1 by roughly @xmath280 . with the bulge of m31 as the reference field , the distance of @xcite would be lowered to @xmath281mpc , and the @xcite distance would be reduced to @xmath282mpc .",
    "both of these values are in line with our measurement .",
    "the role that the three dominant members of the ic  342/maffei group have played in the evolution of the milky way and its neighbours has been a subject of controversy due to their uncertain distances .",
    "previous estimates of the radial velocities and distances to maffei  1 and ic  342 suggested that these galaxies could have been in the vicinity of the local group within the last 5 to 8 gyr @xcite , in the process affecting its early dynamical evolution .",
    "this conclusion is all the more significant given that a fundamental tenet of local group timing is that the milky way and m31 have always behaved dynamically like an isolated pair .",
    "the new velocity and distance for maffei  1 make possible a new judgment about the galaxy s relevance to the local group . with a heliocentric velocity of @xmath283 ,",
    "the velocity of maffei  1 with respect to the centroid of the local group is @xmath284 @xcite .",
    "adopting @xmath285 , the hubble distance to maffei  1 is @xmath286 .",
    "this is somewhat higher than the distance computed above , but it is easily possible that it is distorted by the peculiar motion of maffei  1 arising from its association with the ic  342/maffei group .",
    "the mean velocity of the three dominant galaxies relative to the local group is @xmath287 , where the recessional velocities of maffei  2 and ic  342 have been adopted to be those given by @xcite and @xcite , respectively . using this velocity , the hubble distance comes down to @xmath19mpc , which is marginally consistent with our result .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is unlikely that maffei  1 interacted with the local group since the big bang .",
    "further discussion of this issue will be given in @xcite , where modern distances to ic  342 and maffei  2 will be derived and shown to be close to that derived here for maffei  1 .",
    "new spectroscopy of maffei  1 at low and high resolution has been presented .",
    "the @xmath0index has been measured for the first time , and the heliocentric velocity and velocity dispersion have been derived with improved accuracy .    the @xmath0index was used to re - evaluate the extinction . to avoid the uncertainties inherent in @xmath14-band photometry of maffei  1 ,",
    "the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 for elliptical galaxies was examined by constructing a sample of relatively unobscured objects with existing photometry .",
    "a strong correlation was discovered , which was employed to estimate the intrinsic @xmath1 colour , and , thus , @xmath210 for maffei  1 .",
    "taking care to compensate for the effect of extinction on the @xmath0index and on shifts in effective wavelengths , the optical depth at @xmath2 due to galactic dust was estimated to be @xmath288 . integrating an appropriately extinguished sed for an elliptical galaxy through the response curve for the @xmath22 filter , @xmath4 @xmath5mag .",
    "the value of @xmath289 found by @xcite was an overestimate because of inadequate or incorrect compensation for effective wavelength shifts .",
    "the distance of maffei  1 was derived by constructing the fundamental plane for the coma cluster in @xmath7 , then taking the weighted average of the fundamental plane distance and the mean of two estimates from the @xmath10@xmath11 relation .",
    "the result is @xmath16mpc . it is lower than the estimates of @xcite and @xcite , which are founded upon the brightest stars seen at @xmath15 .",
    "we suggest that this discrepancy is due to their assumption of similar stellar populations among maffei  1 , m31 and m32 , despite indications to the contrary .",
    "the revised properties of maffei  1 are summarized in table  [ tabmaf ] . the apparent magnitude in @xmath22 after correction for extinction shows that maffei  1 is among the brightest galaxies in the northern sky . knowing the extinction , the apparent @xmath290 colour and the surface brightness profile in @xmath7 can be used to judge the unextinguished diameter at the standard isophote ( i.e. , @xmath291 in @xmath14 ) .",
    "based upon the fixed - ellipse profile of @xcite , the diameter of maffei  1 is @xmath292 , which is two - thirds that of the full moon .",
    "the only other nearby galaxy in the class of maffei  1 is centaurus  a. @xcite give a detailed summary of distance estimates to this galaxy and adopt the weighted mean .",
    "we modify their result by shifting the distance to the ngc  4258 zero - point adopted throughout this paper @xcite .",
    "we also update the estimate obtained from surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) in @xmath7 @xcite , which are known to be a more robust distance indicator than fluctuations in @xmath15 . @xcite",
    "present a new @xmath7-band calibration , which we apply to the fluctuation magnitude measured by @xcite .",
    "the resulting distance modulus is @xmath293mag corrected to the ngc  4258 zero - point . in deriving this value",
    ", the extinction corrections employed were obtained from @xmath59 @xcite in the manner described for maffei  1 . after substituting this result for the previous sbf distance adopted by @xcite",
    ", we obtain a weighted mean distance modulus of @xmath294 , which corresponds to @xmath295 .",
    "the distance estimates to maffei  1 from the fundamental plane and @xmath10@xmath11 relation suggest that maffei  1 is closer , making it the nearest giant elliptical galaxy to the milky way . however , based upon the total apparent magnitude given in the lyon extragalactic database ( @xmath296 ) , the absolute magnitude of cen  a is @xmath297 .",
    "maffei  1 is fainter by @xmath298 .",
