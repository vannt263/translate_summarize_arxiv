    "devices using unique quantum - mechanical features can perform information processing in a much more efficient or even unattainable way than those relying just on classical physics .",
    "this fundamental discovery has stimulated in the last few years a big deal of work and scientific debates in the new born field of quantum computation.@xcite from a conceptual point of view these results represent a serious challenge to the time - honored notion of _ universal computational schemes _ independent of an underlying physical theory : information as well as computation are _ intrinsically _ physical . on",
    "the other hand , physical realizations of a quantum computer would result in tremendous practical advantages .",
    "the key ingredients which endow qc devices with computational capabilities that supersede their classical counterparts are basically : ( i ) the linear structure of their state space ; ( ii ) the unitary character of their dynamical evolution ; ( iii ) the tensorised form of multiparticle state spaces .",
    "the first two properties allow for a parallel processing of an arbitrary number of data sets , encoded in suitable quantum states . by resorting to quantum interference , between different computational branches",
    ", one can selectively amplify desired parts of the state vector in order to optimize the probability that a final ( i.e. , read - out ) measurement will give us the information we were looking for . point ( iii )",
    "represents another striking departure from classicality : due to _ entanglement _ , combining different quantum systems results in an exponential growth of the available coding space ; moreover , the tensor - product structure is at the very basis of many efficient quantum manipulations .",
    "unfortunately , all this holds just for _ closed _ quantum systems .",
    "real systems are unavoidably coupled with environmental ( i.e. , non computational ) degrees of freedom . such open character spoils points ( i ) and ( ii ) eventually turning quantum computing to classical .",
    "different computational branches get entangled with different ( quasi - orthogonal ) quantum states of the environment and their interference is then no longer observable . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the relevant state space , given by density matrices , has now a _",
    "convex _ structure and the allowed quantum dynamics is described by cp - maps.@xcite initial pure preparations are typically corrupted on extremely short time - scales due to quantum - coherence loss that makes them mixed : the initial information irreversibly leaks out from the system into the huge number of uncontrollable degrees of freedom of the environment .",
    "this phenomenon the so called decoherence problem in qc  @xcite represents the major obstacle for the experimental realization of any quantum - computing system .",
    "other challenging requirements are of course given by the necessity of being able to perform on a system , with a _ well - defined _ state space , long coherent quantum manipulations ( _ gating _ ) , precise quantum - state synthesis and detection as well .    a major theoretical achievement has been made by showing that one can , in principle , _ actively _ stabilize quantum states by means of quantum error correction.@xcite the latter , built in analogy with its classical counterpart , assumes that the quantum bits ( _ qubits _ ) are coupled to independent environments .",
    "the information is then encoded in a subtle redundant way that allows , monitoring the systems and conditionally carrying on suitable quantum operations , to tolerate a certain ( small ) amount of decoherence and imperfect gating as well.@xcite    it is basically the need of dealing with systems sufficiently decoupled from the external environment that , up - to - now , has limited the existing realizations to atomic and molecular implementations .",
    "furthermore , the extremely advanced technological state - of - the - art in these fields allows for the manipulations required in simple qcs.@xcite however , any interesting qc would require a large number of quantum gates and qubits as well , and all the present approaches suffer from the problem of _ scalability _ to large , i.e. highly integrated , quantum processors .",
    "one is then naturally led to consider the viability of solid - state implementations . in particular , by resorting to present semiconductor technology , one might benefit synergetically from the recent progress in ultrafast optoelectronics  @xcite and in nanostructure fabrication and characterization.@xcite    the first drawback of such a kind of proposal is that the _ typical _ decoherence time @xmath0 in semiconductors is of the order of picoseconds . on the other hand ,",
    "the relevant parameter is the ratio between the typical time - scale of gating @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath2 represents the number of elementary ( coherent ) operations that one could perform on the system before its coherence being lost .",
    "divincenzo and loss  @xcite have proposed to use non - equilibrium spin dynamics in quantum dots for quantum computation .",
    "this exploits the low decoherence of spin degrees of freedom in comparison to the one of charge excitations , being the former much less coupled with the environment .",
    "nevertheless , the required magnetic gating is extremely challenging from a technological point of view , and the ratio @xmath2 does not allow for the number of gate operations within the decoherence time required by concrete qc s .",
    "ultrafast laser technology is now able to generate electronic excitations on a sub - picosecond time - scale and to perform on such states a variety of coherent - carrier - control operations.@xcite if one can speculate to resort to such a technology for realizing gating of _ charge _ degrees of freedom then coherence times on nano / microsecond scales can be regarded as `` long '' ones .    in this paper",
    "we analyse in a detailed way the recent idea of implementing _ quantum error avoiding _",
    "strategies.@xcite the goal here is to suppress decoherence in a quantum register realized by the lowest energy _ charge _",
    "excitations of a semiconductor quantum - dot array.@xcite in this case , the noise source is given by electron - phonon scattering , which is recognized to be the most efficient decoherence channel in such a system @xcite .",
    "despite of the _ a priori _ complexity of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) phononic environment , we will show that the underlying dynamical - symmetry allows , by means of a proper quantum encoding , to increase the decoherence time by several orders of magnitude with respect to the bulk value .",
    "the focus of the present paper is mostly conceptual and the problem of actual preparation / manipulation of the resulting codewords will not be addressed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",

    "notice that if @xmath7 is subdecoherent for the @xmath99 s it is subdecoherent for any set of lindblad operators included in @xmath100    from a physical point of view , the algebra @xmath84 of lindblad operators represents the set of the register modes that are incoherently excited by the environment ; looking for states that are annihilated by as many linbdlad operators as possible is then as looking for states that are `` vacua '' for the largest number of such excitations and therefore maximally decoupled with environment.@xcite it is important to emphasize that such a decoupling can be achieved thanks the algebraic - dynamical structure of the model without any assumptions about the ( weakness ) of the register - environment interaction .",
    "loosely speaking , one can say that for generic @xmath65 s , the liouvillian is such that , given _ any _ register preparation , the environment forces the coding system to explore the totality of its hilbert space so that there is no safe place where storing quantum information , instead for some `` magic '' @xmath65 the lindblad algebra gets smaller allowing just for a limited probing of the register space of states by the environment strongly dependent on the initial register data : free room is left for `` hiding '' quantum information .",

    "the model ( [ ham ] ) is soluble in elementary way @xcite .",

    "turning back to the general @xmath10 case , to exemplify the collective nature of the decoherence - dissipation dynamics let us consider the states ( @xmath10 _ even _ ) @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a dimer partition of the qubit array , and @xmath133 the first state in ( [ states ] ) is simply the totally symmetric @xmath134 state ( belonging to the @xmath33 multiplet of the vacuum ) whereas the @xmath135 s are products of singlet or triplet pair - states depending on the signature @xmath136 of the register dimer partition @xmath137 this latter family of states ( [ states ] ) will play an important role in the following .",

    "in this section we shall discuss a potential application of the above sub - decoherent quantum - encoding strategies to realistic , i.e. , state - of - the - art , semiconductor - based nanostructures .",
    "since in semiconductors the primary source of decoherence is known to be carrier - phonon scattering , we will consider as prototypical systems quasi zero - dimensional ( 0d ) structures , for which the reduced phase - space available allows for a significant suppression of phonon - induced energy relaxation and dephasing .",
    "we will choose as prototype of quantum register an array of semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "in particular , we will consider as quantum dot ( qd ) a gaas / algaas structure similar to that studied in . here , various effects due to carrier - carrier interaction will _ not _ be considered .",
    "this is , of course , a potential limitation of our analysis , especially in relation to state preparation / manipulation ( not addressed in this paper ) . indeed , the latter requires a controllable source of entanglement , i.e. , a qubit - qubit interaction that might be provided by `` switchable '' coulomb couplings.@xcite on the other hand , our coding states will involve _ single - electron _ occupations only ; for such states the intra - dot coulomb repulsion is clearly absent , while the inter - dot one at the distances relevant for our quantum encoding is found to be negligible.@xcite moreover , since the system under consideration is based on intrinsic iii - v materials , carrier - impurity scattering is negligible .",
    "generally speaking , hamiltonian modifications will result in leakage from the coding subspace only on a longer time - scale with respect to the phonon - scattering one , i.e. , it does not affect the stability classification based on @xmath78 ( see sect .",
    "[ s : theory ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that there exists a whole class of interactions leaving the code invariant.@xcite      the confinement potential @xmath150 giving rise to the quasi-0d carrier states in such a qd structure is properly described in terms of a quantum - well ( qw ) profile @xmath151 along the growth direction of the structure plus a two - dimensional ( 2d ) parabolic potential @xmath152 in the normal plane .",
    "more specifically , a carrier within the @xmath153-th qd structure is described by the following single - particle hamiltonian @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the 2d harmonic - oscillator potential in the ( @xmath156 ) plane perpendicular to the ( @xmath157 ) array axis ( which coincides with the growth axis of the qd structure ) , while @xmath158 is a 1d square - well potential centered at @xmath159 with width @xmath160 and infinite walls,@xcite @xmath161 being the array periodicity , i.e. , the inter - dot distance .",
    "this choice for the single - particle hamiltonian , even though not generally valid , well describes the 0d carrier confinement of the low - energy states in the qd structure , which are the only relevant states for the quantum encoding considered .",
    "we would like to point out that the very same qd model turned out to be able to explain , in a quantitative way , the addition spectra reported in .@xcite    the hamiltonian ( [ singleh ] ) is elementary soluble , its spectrum being the sum of the parallel and perpendicular contributions : @xmath162 the corresponding 3d eigenstates will be factorized according to : @xmath163 the total free - carrier hamiltonian describing our qd array can then be expressed in the ( second- quantized ) form @xmath164 where the fermionic operators @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) create ( destroy ) an electron in the @xmath153-th qd in state @xmath167 .",

    "the crucial point is to observe that , for @xmath231 ) large enough , this integral is dominated by contributions around @xmath232 ; therefore @xmath233.\\ ] ] recalling that @xmath234 is the typical length scale of carrier confinement in the @xmath235-@xmath236 plane , this behaviour is easily understood : due to the energy - conservation constraints ( @xmath237 ) , for delocalized in - plane wavefunctions ( with respect to the length scale @xmath238 ) the significant fluctuation of @xmath170 in the considered state is small ; therefore @xmath239 in other words , due to the exponential suppression in the overlap integral of the contributions from phononic modes with non - vanishing in - plane components _ the system behaves as in the presence of a single effective phonon mode along the @xmath157 axis resonant with the qubit excitations_. as clearly confirmed by our numerical analysis reported in sect .",
    "[ s : sim ] , this is an extremely important feature of the semiconductor model considered : in spite of its 3d nature and of the presence of a continuum of decoherence - inducing phonon modes , in this regime the carrier subsystem experiences an _ effectively @xmath240-d coherent environment _ , that in a good approximation can be described by the circular model ( cm ) analysed in app .",
    "a.@xcite    this model , parametrized by the dimensionless quantity @xmath241 , represents a non trivial example of a register - environment coupling that admits a rich structure ( as a function of @xmath242 ) of sub - decoherent encodings .",
    "from this point of view , it realizes a generalization of the replica symmetric model ( pure collective decoherence ) discussed in , that is recovered for @xmath243 . here , we limit ourselves to summarize the main result :    safe quantum encoding are possible for the models such that @xmath244 is a @xmath245-th roots of the unity , the most efficient case being the points @xmath246 ; when all the register cells feel the same external coupling the dynamics is maximally collective thanks the full permutational symmetry .",
    "the existence of infinitely many `` magic '' points is clearly due to the unphysical nature of the cm that allows for undamped interactions between objects separated by arbitrary large distances . in realistic systems ( as the ones investigated in this paper ) the cosine dependence of the @xmath224 matrix can be only approximated and the periodicity with respect to the cell distance eventually destroyed by some overimposed decay . in a way ,",
    "the present situation is very similar to having a string of ( two - level ) atoms in a cavity coupled with a single resonant electromagnetic mode @xcite .",
    "in this section we will present our numerical analysis of subdecoherent quantum encoding for realistic qd structures .      as a starting point ,",
    "let us discuss the role of carrier - phonon interaction in a single qd structure .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the total ( emission plus absorption ) carrier - phonon scattering rate at low temperature ( @xmath247k ) as a function of the energy spacing @xmath41 for three different values of the gaas qw width ( @xmath248 nm ) . since the energy range considered is smaller than the optical - phonon energy ( @xmath249mev in gaas ) , due to energy conservation scattering with lo phonons is not allowed .",
    "therefore , the only phonon mode @xmath169 which contributes to the rate of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is that of acoustic phonons .",
    "again , due to energy conservation , the only phonon wavevectors involved must satisfy @xmath250 , @xmath251 being the gaas sound velocity .",
    "it follows that by increasing the energy spacing @xmath41 the wavevector @xmath252 is increased , which reduces the carrier - phonon coupling entering in the electron - phonon interaction and then the scattering rate .",
    "this well - established behaviour , known as phonon bottleneck,@xcite is typical of a quasi-0d structure . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for @xmath253mev a standard value for many state - of - the - art qd structures the carrier - phonon scattering rate is already suppressed by almost three orders of magnitude compared to the corresponding bulk values.@xcite    in addition to the bottleneck scenario discussed so far , for a given value of the energy spacing @xmath41 we see that for small values of @xmath160 we have an increase of the carrier - phonon rate . in spite of the reduction of the 3d volume available to the carrier states , the overall coupling is increased , basically due to the progressive relaxation of momentum conservation along the growth ( @xmath157 ) direction .",
    "we will now show that by means of a proper information encoding , i.e. , a proper choice of the initial multi - system quantum state , and a proper design of our qd array , we can strongly suppress phonon - induced decoherence processes , thus further improving the above single - dot scenario . to this end , let us consider a four - qd array , which is the simplest noiseless qubit register ( see app .",
    "a ) from the short - time expansion discussed in sect .",
    "[ s : me ] , we have numerically evaluated the decoherence rate for such qd array choosing as energy splitting @xmath253mev and qw width @xmath254 nm ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . as initial state",
    "we have chosen the singlet @xmath255 [ see eq .",
    "[ states ] ] defined by the dimer partition @xmath256 .",
    "we stress that , when the cm approximation ( see app .",
    "a ) is not exactly fulfilled , different singlets have different decoherence rates .",
    "indeed , the larger is the distance @xmath257 between the pair elements in the dimer covering , the greater is the deviation from the strictly periodic behaviour .",
    "thus from eq .",
    "(  [ rate ] ) it follows , for instance , that the singlet corresponding to the dimer partition @xmath258 has a greater decoherence rate than @xmath255 ; the decoherence rate obtained from our numerical calculation is shown as solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) as a function of the inter - dot distance @xmath161 .",
    "the uncorrelated - dot decoherence rate is also reported as dashed line for comparison . as suggested by the analysis of the circular model presented in app .",
    "a , in spite of the 3d nature of the sum over @xmath170 entering the calculation of the function @xmath259 [ see eq .",
    "( [ matr - el ] ) ] , the decoherence rate exhibits a periodic behaviour over a range comparable to the typical qd length scale . in the circular - model approximation ( and for @xmath260 ) one obtains @xmath261\\simeq 2\\,\\gamma_{00}^{(-)}\\,[1-\\cos(q\\,a)],$ ] from which it follows that for @xmath262 the considered state is stable .",
    "this effect  which would be natural for a 1d phonon system  stems from the exponential suppression , in the overlap integral , of the contributions of phononic modes with non - vanishing in - plane component , previously discussed .",
    "this 1d behavior is extremely important since it allows , by suitable choice of the inter - dot distance @xmath161 , to realize a symmetric regime in which all the dots experience the _ same _ phonon field and therefore decohere collectively .",
    "figure [ fig2](a ) shows that for the particular qd structure considered , case c should correspond to a decoherence - free evolution of a singlet state , which is not the case for a and b ( see symbols in the figure ) .    in order to better understand how this sort of effective",
    "1d behaviour depends on the material parameters considered , we have repeated the subdecoherence analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) by artificially increasing the gaas effective mass .",
    "more specifically , figs .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and [ fig2](c ) present the same decoherence analysis , respectively , for values of @xmath263 and @xmath264 . as we can see , by increasing the effective - mass value the 1d character in ( a ) is progressively suppressed .",
    "this can be clearly understood as follows : the increase of the effective mass leads to a stronger and stronger localization of the 2d harmonic - oscillator wavefunctions which , in turn , can easily interact with transverse ( @xmath181 ) phonon modes @xmath170 .",
    "as far as the unitary component of the liouvillian is concerned , one can easily show that [ for any @xmath80 eigenstate of @xmath101 ] @xmath266 where @xmath267 figure [ fig3 ] shows @xmath268 $ ] as a function of the inter - dot distance @xmath161 .",
    "we find an oscillatory behaviour similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ; it stems from the fact that ( for the material parameters considered ) @xmath269,$ ] with @xmath270 .",
    "thus , for values of @xmath161 corresponding to a subdecoherent dynamics [ see point c in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] the @xmath192 contribution , also known as polaronic shift , is negligible as well .      in order to extend the above short - time analysis ,",
    "we have performed a direct numerical integration of the master equation ( see sect .  [",
    "s : me ] ) , thus obtaining the reduced density matrix @xmath221 as a function of time .",
    "also the lamb - shift terms discussed in sect .  [ s : theory ] have been taken into account .",
    "starting from the same gaas qd structure considered so far , we have simulated the above noiseless encoding for a four - qd array .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the fidelity as a function of time as obtained from our numerical solution of the master equation .",
    "in particular , we have performed three different simulations for the same initial state @xmath271 corresponding to the different values of @xmath161 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . consistently with our short - time analysis , for case c we find a strong suppression of the decoherence rate which extends the sub - nanosecond time - scale of the b case ( corresponding to the uncorrelated - dot rate ) to the microsecond time - scale .",
    "an other quantity which properly describes the environment - induced corruption of information is the linear entropy @xmath272\\equiv \\mbox{tr } ( \\rho-\\rho^2)$ ] .",
    "its production rate is also directly connected to @xmath78 ; indeed for an initial pure preparation we have @xmath273 . for intial pure preparations .",
    "the time evolution of the linear entropy , as obtained from our numerical solution of the me , is reported in fig .",
    "we can clearly recognize an initial transient ( of the order of @xmath78 ) in which the register , getting entangled with the environment , decoheres ; this is followed by a subsequent slower relaxation dynamics .",
    "the time - dependent analysis of figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] confirms that by means of the proposed encoding strategy one can realize a decoherence - free evolution over a time - scale comparable with typical recombination times in semiconductor materials @xcite .",
    "we have investigated a possible semiconductor - based implementation of the subdecoherent quantum - encoding strategy , i.e. error avoiding , recently proposed in .",
    "the goal is the suppression of phase - breaking processes in a quantum register realized by the lowest energy _ charge _",
    "excitations of a semiconductor qd array.@xcite in this case , the primary noise source is given by electron - phonon scattering , which is considered to be the most efficient decoherence channel in such a system.@xcite    the main result is that , in spite of the 3d nature of carrier - phonon interaction in our qd structure , by means of a proper quantum encoding as well as of a proper tailoring of the semiconductor structure , one can in principle increase the coherence time by several orders of magnitude with respect to the bulk value .",
    "this would allow to realize a coherent quantum - mechanical evolution on a time - scale longer compared to that of ultrafast optical spectroscopy .",
    "from this point of view this result might constitute an important step toward a solid - state implementation of quantum computers . on the other hand",
    ", it certainly represents a first non - trivial example of a solid - state quantum system for which one can apply quantum error avoiding strategies .    as already discussed in sect .",
    "[ s : appl ] carrier - phonon scattering is not the only source of decoherence in semiconductors . in conventional bulk materials also carrier - carrier interaction is found to play a crucial role . however , state - of - the - art qd structures often referred to as semiconductor macroatoms  @xcite can be regarded as few - electron systems basically decoupled from the electronic degrees of freedom of the environment . for the semiconductor qd array considered",
    ", the main source of coulomb - induced `` noise '' may arise from the inter - dot coupling .",
    "however , since such coulomb coupling vanishes for large values of the qd separation and since the proposed encoding scheme can be realized for values of @xmath161 much larger than the typical coulomb - correlation length ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , a proper design of our quantum register may rule out such additional decoherence channels.@xcite    the actual implementation of the suggested encoding relies , of course , on precise quantum state synthesis and manipulations .",
    "this further step , not addressed in this paper , represents the most challenging open issue concerning the ultimate usefulness of the proposed coding strategy .",
