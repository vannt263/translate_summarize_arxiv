    "the phenomenological success of the standard model of quarks and leptons , and their observed patterns , indicate that there exist a more fundamental basis . here",
    "we present a simple preon model where leptons , quarks and heavy vector bosons are composite , and where many of the _ ad hoc _ ingredients of the standard model are clear - cut consequences of this inner structure .",
    "we limit the present discussion to straightforward , qualitative consequences of the model , and leave a more quantitative analysis , requiring extra assumptions , to future publications .",
    "although there is currently no _ direct _ experimental evidence for ( or against ) preons , there are quite a few phenomenological , and logical , circumstances that point at compositeness , some of which have been known for long  @xcite :    0.1 cm @xmath6 there are `` too many '' leptons and quarks , but still a pattern among them . historically , such patterns have led to ideas about compositeness , with the quark model as a modern example , and the periodic system as an older one .    0.1 cm @xmath6 the least elegant ( mathematical ) features of the standard model are due to the weak gauge bosons being massive ( and unstable and of different charges ) .",
    "they might be preon - antipreon states , in analogy to the nuclear force being `` leaked '' by quark - antiquark states .",
    "if so , there is no fundamental weak force , nor a higgs mechanism .",
    "the photon-@xmath7 mixing is equivalent to the photon-@xmath8 mixing in the vector - dominance model .",
    "0.1 cm @xmath6 an overlooked hint is that most leptons and quarks are _ unstable _ , which in our view disqualifies them as fundamental particles .",
    "historically , decays of `` elementary '' particles have sooner or later been interpreted as processes among more fundamental objects .",
    "0.1 cm @xmath6 there are mixings or oscillations , among some quarks , among the vector fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the weak interaction , and among some neutrinos .",
    "this reminds about the chemical mixing of isotopes and the quantum - mechanical one of @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons , both being due to compositeness .",
    "0.1 cm @xmath6 the conservation ( exact or approximate ) of lepton numbers , baryon number and weak isospin , are not yet properly understood . when strong isospin and strangeness were introduced for hadrons , on similar grounds , the explanation later turned out to be in terms of compositeness ( quarks ) .",
    "0.1 cm early preon models focused on explaining the lightest quarks ( @xmath11 and @xmath2 ) and leptons ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) with as few preons as possible .",
    "this means either a minimal number of ( two ) different preons , _",
    "e.g. _ , the `` rishons ''  @xcite , or a minimal number of ( two ) preons inside a quark or lepton , _ e.g. _ , the `` haplons ''  @xcite . following these ideas",
    "we now present a preon model for _ all _ leptons and quarks , addressing some of the less understood cornerstones of the standard model .",
    "examples are lepton - number conservation , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixings  @xcite and the `` photonic '' behaviour of the @xmath7 boson .",
    "we have been much inspired by other models :    0.1 cm @xmath6 the original quark model  @xcite , prescribing that the hadrons known in the early 1960s can be explained in terms of three quark flavours , with an ( approximate ) @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "0.1 cm @xmath6 the rishon and haplon models , where the lightest quarks and leptons contain , respectively , three spin-@xmath0 , or one spin-@xmath0 and one spin-@xmath14 preon each .    0.1 cm @xmath6 diquark models ( reviewed in  @xcite ) ,",
    "often prescribing that quarks pair up in total spin @xmath14 .    0.1 cm @xmath6 supersymmetry , where spin-@xmath0 objects have spin-@xmath14 relatives , even if only phenomenologically , _",
    "e.g. _ , as a quark - diquark `` supersymmetry ''  @xcite .",
    "a preon model for six leptons and six quarks must have at least five different preons in the sense of the haplon model , _",
    "i.e. _ , three with spin @xmath0 and two with spin @xmath14 , or _ vice versa_. a symmetric scheme should have three of each , giving nine leptons and nine quarks .",
    "the spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath14 preons can be arranged as partners of identical charges .",
    "we suggest that the spin-@xmath14 ones are not fundamental , but tightly bound `` dipreon '' pairs , kept together by spin - dependent forces . calling the preons @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with electric charges @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath18 ( by choice ; there is an ambiguity in the names preon and antipreon ) , we get the simple , symmetric scheme in table i. each preon has a `` supersymmetric '' partner , which is the anti - dipreon formed by the other two ( anti)preons .",
    ".the `` supersymmetric '' preon scheme . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.1 cm @xmath6 the scheme is similar to the vector meson octet in the quark model ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "both carry a `` leakage force '' ; the weak and nuclear ones , and both @xmath7 and @xmath8 `` mix '' with the photon through their constituents .",
    "there is hence a `` vector meson dominance '' of the photon also in the preon sector .    0.1 cm @xmath6 @xmath21 decays are split - ups into other preon states , like @xmath22 through @xmath23 .",
    "such channels dominate also @xmath7 decay , but there are , in addition , annihilation channels inside @xmath7 , _ e.g. _ , @xmath24",
    ".    0.1 cm @xmath6 weak isospin and the weinberg mixing appear in the model for the same reason as the cabibbo and neutrino mixings , _",
    "i.e. _ , as consequences of preon - flavour @xmath1 , which mixes states with identical net preon flavours into mass eigenstates .",
    "the weak @xmath25 isotriplet wave function is supposed to be @xmath26 , while the isosinglet is @xmath27 . in terms of the weinberg angle ,",
    "@xmath28 admixture depends only on the @xmath16 and @xmath15 electric charges .",
    "then we expect the admixture ( up to a sign set by convention in the definitions of the cabibbo and weinberg angles ) to be the same in the ground - states @xmath29 and @xmath30 :    @xmath31    with @xmath32 and @xmath33  @xcite the @xmath34 and the @xmath35 .",
    "this is a fair agreement considering the rough assumptions .",
    "0.1 cm @xmath6 the nearest orthogonal partner of the @xmath7 is a heavier @xmath36 .",
    "one can not profit from the analogy with the vector mesons @xmath8 and @xmath37 , and predict that @xmath36 will be near @xmath7 in mass , since the unequal @xmath38 admixture differs from the quark situation in vector mesons .",
    "in addition , @xmath36 might have a superheavy @xmath39 component , in analogy with scalar mesons , where the @xmath40 component makes the @xmath41 much heavier than the @xmath42 .",
    "0.1 cm @xmath6 scalar counterparts to the vector bosons are expected in many preon models  @xcite .",
    "it is not known if these are even heavier than the vector bosons , or have an extra weak coupling to other particles .",
    "our model , as defined by the preon schemes of tables i - iv , provides a qualitative understanding of several phenomena that are not normally addressed by preon models , nor explained within the standard model .",
    "it can hence serve as a basis for a deeper analysis of the many disjunct ingredients of the latter .",
    "in addition , the model predicts several new leptons and quarks , which might be discovered in the near future , maybe even in existing data from the ( closed ) cern lep facility .    however , many problems remain to be solved : the model still lacks a dynamics , so that masses , reaction rates , etc .",
    ", can not yet be reproduced or predicted . in this respect",
    "we are worse off than the original quark model , which had at least a phenomenological mass formula for baryons .",
    "also , it is not yet clear if _ all _ phenomenologically successful aspects of the electroweak theory can be explained by preons .",
    "more work is obviously needed before a quantitative theory may emerge .",
    "this will include making extra assumptions , in addition to the mere `` observations '' made here , and analysing the data in the light of these",
    ". we will continue our efforts with a deeper analysis of the neutrino sector , in order to find oscillation and decay patterns .",
    "a thorough analysis of existing cern lep data would also be desirable , in search of decay products of a heavy neutrino , along the lines predicted by our model .",
    "we acknowledge illuminating discussions and correspondences with d. chang , a. davidson , h. fritzsch , d. lichtenberg , e. ma , b. mckellar , e. predazzi , r. volkas and n. tracas , as well as valuable experimental information from g. bellettini , r. partridge and g. vandalen .",
