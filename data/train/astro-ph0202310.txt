    "measurements of the cosmic infrared background ( cirb ) probe the integrated emission from distant galaxies @xcite .",
    "the brightness and spectrum of the cirb is sensitive to galaxy number density , luminosity and evolution , as well as cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , a search for the cirb must account for the local zodiacal and stellar foregrounds .",
    "these have proven difficult to eliminate , even at @xmath14 @xmath0 m where the local foreground from thermal emission and scattering by zodiacal dust is minimal .",
    "dirbe reported upper limits on the cirb at near - infrared wavelengths @xcite , limited by foreground subtraction .",
    "the total astrophysical emission observed by dirbe in a @xmath15 beam contains a significant emission component from stars .",
    "dwek & arendt ( 1998 ) used ground - based @xmath11-band galaxy counts along with the dirbe data to obtain a tentative detection of the cirb .",
    "gorjian , wright & chary ( 2000 ) independently claimed a tentative detection of the cirb using ground - based @xmath16-band counts to account for stellar emission in the dirbe beams .",
    "wright & reese ( 2000 ) reported a detection using a different zodiacal model than used by hauser et al .",
    "matsumoto ( 2000 ) analyzed observations with the near infrared spectrometer ( nirs ) on irts , with an @xmath17 field of view that is significantly smaller than that of dirbe , and reported an isotropic near - infrared component peaking at @xmath18 1.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "brightness fluctuations also probe the cirb .",
    "the fluctuations contain information on the number counts and clustering properties of sources below the detection limit @xcite .",
    "poissonian fluctuations ( `` confusion noise '' ) are predicted based on models of galaxy evolution , including stellar and cirrus components from our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the brightness distribution depends on the index , @xmath19 , of integrated source counts @xmath20 , and can thus be used to probe the density of sources below the detection limit @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of fluctuations measures the clustering of sources @xcite on size scales of galaxy clustering .",
    "for example , nirs / irts observations show brightness fluctuations prominent at @xmath21 , appearing at the level of @xmath18 5% of the total diffuse sky brightness @xcite .",
    "confusion noise sets the limiting sensitivity for future space - borne infrared observations , such as for sirtf @xcite and astro - f @xcite .",
    "we present integrated source counts and a statistical analysis of residual brightness fluctuations in wide - field images obtained with a rocket - borne near - infrared camera at @xmath22 @xmath0 m .",
    "these images provide a direct account of the point source contribution to the near - infrared sky brightness , and an indirect measure of the brightness contribution from sources below this detection limit .",
    "the near - infrared telescope experiment ( nite ) consists of a 16 @xmath23 rocket - borne telescope cooled by supercritical helium and a 256 @xmath24 256 low - background insb focal plane array .",
    "the array is located at the focus of an @xmath25 gregorian telescope providing a @xmath26 field of view with a plate scale of @xmath2 per pixel .",
    "a 3.5 @xmath0 m long - wavelength pass infrared filter and the intrinsic long wavelength cutoff of the insb focal plane array defines the 3.5 to 5 @xmath0 m spectral band of the instrument . the array , sampled continuously and non - destructively `` up the slope '' at 3.8 @xmath27 over a 10 @xmath28 reset interval , gives near - background - limited noise performance and maximum flexibility in data reduction .",
    "the telescope and cryogenic baffle tube were cooled by supercritical liquid helium to eliminate thermal emission from the instrument .",
    "the focal plane array was operated at @xmath18 30 @xmath11 for optimal noise performance .",
    "further details on the instrument may be found in bock et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "nite was designed to probe diffuse near - infrared emissions about nearby edge - on spiral galaxies , arising from possible low - mass stars in the massive halo .",
    "analysis of data from two flights , on 1997 may 28 centered about ngc 4565 , and on 1998 may 22 centered about ngc 5907 , produced strict upper limits on the near - infrared halo brightness @xcite .",
    "for purposes of assessing point source contributions to the near - infrared background , the two fields allow us to evaluate the relative contributions of point sources in the ngc 4565 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ; @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and the ngc 5907 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) fields .    we observed each region by stepping the field of view @xmath37 in a square pattern , and integrating for 20 @xmath28 in two 10 @xmath28 exposures at each position .",
    "this sequence produces a complete map consisting of 8 individual exposures .",
    "the observation sequence repeats with a slight shift of @xmath38 to sample the sky with different pixels .",
    "the central @xmath39 region around the target edge - on galaxy is thus observed in each of the 16 exposures .",
    "bright calibration stars , observed at the beginning and end of the sequence , and bright stars in the field allow us to calibrate the responsivity and point spread function ( psf ) of the instrument .",
    "further details on the observations for each flight may be found in uemizu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and yost et al .",
    "we present a statistical analysis from the 1997 observation about ngc 4565 .",
    "the 1998 observation of ngc 5907 , at lower galactic latitude ( @xmath33 ) , suffers from a relatively larger contribution from stars .",
    "furthermore , the 1998 observation has only 8 useful exposures due to a large terrestrial signal that appeared in the latter portion of the flight .",
    "we use the 1998 observations to assess the relative abundance of detected point sources at lower galactic latitude .",
    "the 1997 data has a noisy detector readout that samples every fourth column on the array .",
    "the cause of the excess noise , a loose wire - bond to the focal plane array , was subsequently repaired after the flight .",
    "one edge of the array was vignetted by a misalignment with the field stop .",
    "we carefully omit data from the noisy column and the vignetted region throughout the fluctuation analysis ( sections 3.2 , 3.3 , 3.4 , and 4.2 ) .",
    "we adopt the same reduction procedure as in uemizu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , briefly summarized as follows .",
    "we correct each of the 16 exposures for dark current by subtracting a master dark frame with a median dark current of 1.55 @xmath40 , obtained by closing an internal cryogenic ( 5 @xmath11 ) shutter just before launch .",
    "the flat field response is derived by first normalizing each individual exposure on the sky to its mean value .",
    "the mean is determined by applying an iterative 3@xmath41 clip to remove point sources . a flat field frame for each quadrant",
    "is then obtained by evaluating the median value in each pixel over 12 exposures .",
    "thus 4 flat field frames are generated for each of the 4 pointing positions used to observe the central galaxy .",
    "the flat field for each pixel in this reduction procedure is thus derived from observations of numerous patches of sky separated by @xmath18 @xmath42 from the observation position .",
    "we divide all of the exposures by their corresponding flat field frames , and subtract a small constant value from each exposure to account for a slowly varying terrestrial signal .",
    "the time - varying signal , @xmath18 17 @xmath40 , is small compared with the total photocurrent of 160 @xmath40 .",
    "the exposures are aligned to bright stars in the field , and combined to form a @xmath1 mosaic .",
    "we constructed a star mask from the mosaic , masking all pixels 3@xmath41 above the average over the image .",
    "bright point sources are each masked out to regions such that their extended emission is no more than 2% above the total sky background based on the psf .",
    "ngc 4565 is similarly masked based on the results of uemizu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . as the combined mosaic has a higher sensitivity to point sources than the individual exposures , we re - evaluate the flat field frames using the same procedure as with the mask obtained from the mosaic .",
    "the new flat field frames are then combined to produce a final mosaic .",
    "the resulting gray - scale image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fov97 ] , including data from all four array readouts .",
    "the regions on the corners of the image are obtained with only 2 pointings ( 4 exposures ) , while the central region of the image is well sampled with 8 pointings ( 16 exposures ) . the image in fig .",
    "[ fig : fov97 ] has prominent stripes due to data from the noisy column ( for further evaluation of the statistical impact of the noisy columns see fig 4 ) .",
    "the remaining 3 array readouts are separately binned and found to have very similar noise properties , with read noises of 52 @xmath13 0.7 @xmath43 , 53 @xmath13 1 @xmath43 , and 53 @xmath13 0.7 @xmath43 for 10 @xmath28 integration time .",
    "we carefully omit data from the noisy column and the vignetted regions throughout the fluctuation analysis ( sections 3.2 , 3.3 , 3.4 , and 4.2 ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we confine the variation analysis in sections 3.2 and 3.3 to pixels with 100% observing time . to improve our statistical power",
    ", we include pixels with 75% or more observing time for the analysis in sections 3.4 and 4.2 .",
    "identification of point sources in our field of view ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fov97 ] ) is conducted with a psf - fitting using daophot .",
    "bright calibration stars , observed at the beginning and end of the flight sequence , and bright stars in the field allow us to calibrate the responsivity and psf of the instrument .",
    "we iteratively extract sources by locating and masking the brightest sources in our field of view .",
    "the identified sources are individually masked out to regions where the extended psf brightness is @xmath44 2% of the mean sky brightness ,",
    "@xmath45 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6",
    ". we use daophot to extract fluxes from identified sources . for consistency check",
    ", we compare the daophot fluxes with aperture photometry . in the case of very bright sources , we find some discrepencies , since a few are nearby extended galaxies .",
    "we thus use aperture photometry for the bright and extended sources .",
    "the resulting integrated source counts , detected with @xmath46 4@xmath41 significance , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : num_count ] for the 1997 and 1998 fields .",
    "the number counts are not corrected for incompleteness at the faint end .",
    "the large error bars at the bright end are due to the small number of sources .",
    "we produce two independent sky images @xmath47 and @xmath48 from the first 8 and second 8 exposures respectively , to discriminate sources of noise from the instrument , sky , and variations in the gain matrix ( `` flat - field '' errors ) .",
    "we estimate the displacement between @xmath47 and @xmath48 accurately by comparing the centroids of bright stars .",
    "the resulting longitudinal and transverse displacements are @xmath49 0.3 and 0.2 @xmath50 respectively .",
    "as we shall see , subtracting the two images allows us to distinguish noise associated with the array , compared to fluctuations associated with a fixed pattern on the sky .",
    "the measured noise in a single 10 @xmath28 integration is 53 @xmath43 , in good agreement with photon noise , @xmath51 , and readout electronics noise , @xmath18 30 @xmath43 as determined form dark frames before launch , combined in quadrature , @xmath52 .",
    "instrument noise may also include various non - ideal noise sources at a low level , such as a fixed pattern noise on the array , low - level cosmic rays , incomplete subtraction of dark current , and time - varying signals .",
    "subtracting the @xmath47 and @xmath48 images , which are shifted in position relative to one another on the sky , therefore provides an accurate assessment of all sources of instrument noise which are necessarily correlated with array coordinates .    to evaluate sky fluctuations statistically",
    ", we confine our analysis to the 1997 field about ngc 4565 .",
    "@xmath47 consists of a mosaiced image from the first eight exposures , and @xmath48 consists of a mosaiced image from the second eight exposures .",
    "we denote @xmath53 , the average of @xmath47 and @xmath48 with respect to sky coordinates , as the combined sky image .",
    "we mask @xmath47 and @xmath48 for 4@xmath41 sources with a common mask derived from @xmath54 , taking advantage of the higher sensitivity to point sources in the combined image @xmath54 .",
    "both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are corrected for flat - field variations as described above with a common gain matrix .",
    "we consider three sources of noise , instrument noise ( defined to include all un - correlated noise between exposures ) , errors in the gain matrix , and fluctuations on the sky .    because the gain matrix is determined from observations of the sky , it can introduce statistical correlations in the data .",
    "we confine our analysis to the central @xmath55 region to eliminate statistical correlations and to minimize gain errors , `` flat - field noise '' , as follows .",
    "the majority of the pixels in the inner region of the combined image @xmath54 are obtained with 8 independent pixels on the array .",
    "the flat field for each of these pixels is obtained from 6 different patches of sky . in constructing @xmath54 , each point in the inner region is compared with 48 patches of sky located @xmath56 outside the inner region , 24 of which are independent . in the limit that the combined image @xmath54 is dominated by instrument noise , the variance of each pixel in the central region is increased by a factor of @xmath57 due to flat - field variations . in the limit that each exposure is dominated by sky fluctuations , the variance is increased by a factor of @xmath58 . as sky fluctuations and instrument noise are actually of similar amplitude in @xmath54 , the systematic variance of each pixel in the central region",
    "is increased by a factor of @xmath59 .",
    "the factor of @xmath59 is derived by noting that flat - field errors arise from the errors in the off beams , with instrument variance dominating over sky variance in the off beams by a factor of 4 .",
    "however , the variance in @xmath54 is @xmath18 2 times larger than instrument noise , so the relative flat - field variance is @xmath60 , or approximately @xmath59 .",
    "thus variations arising from flat field errors should generally be small in comparison to sky fluctuations in the inner region , and do not contribute to statistical correlations for @xmath61 .",
    "we assume the variance in @xmath62 arises from a combination of instrument noise ( @xmath63 ) , flat - field variations ( @xmath64 ) , and sky fluctuations ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we further confine the following analysis to pixels with full observing time in the central @xmath55 region . the measured variance in @xmath54",
    "is given by    @xmath66    we note that sky fluctuations will have the same amplitude in @xmath47 and @xmath48 because @xmath47 and @xmath48 share a common flat field matrix .",
    "however , the gain for each pixel is derived from an independent arrangement of `` off '' positions , so flat field variations are independent from pixel to pixel .",
    "we assume that instrument noise is uncorrelated in the two images .",
    "the variance in @xmath47 and @xmath48 is thus given as    @xmath67    we can separate these contributions by using the fact that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are displaced from one another by @xmath38 on the sky . by subtracting @xmath47 and @xmath48 with respect to sky coordinates , the variance in the differenced image @xmath68 becomes    @xmath69    comparing the variance of @xmath54 and @xmath70 thus gives a direct measure of the sky fluctuations , @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "we evaluate the instrument noise contribution by subtracting image pairs viewing the sky 10 @xmath28 apart , and determine the variance to be @xmath75 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "as 16 exposures comprise @xmath70 , the estimated contribution from instrument noise is    @xmath76    we then estimate the flat - field contribution to be @xmath77 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "this result agrees within experimental error with our expectation that the variance from flat - field errors is @xmath78 , as described above .",
    "furthermore , we can see that the instrument noise averages down with the number of exposures as expected .",
    "if the array had a fixed pattern noise that did not average down , it would be accounted as flat - field noise .",
    "however since the flat - field noise is in agreement with our expectation , such sources of excess noise must be small .",
    "the variance in each pixel of the combined image @xmath54 is thus marginally dominated by sky fluctuations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] .",
    "we may test the reliability of our estimation by differencing the same two masked sky images with respect to array coordinates .",
    "the resulting difference image @xmath79 is free of flat - field variation , since @xmath47 and @xmath48 share a common gain matrix .",
    "its variance becomes    @xmath80    in agreement with our expected variance of 9.55 @xmath13 0.60 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : vara ] ) , ( [ eqn : varb ] ) , and ( [ eqn : varc ] ) above .",
    "this consistency check shows that flat - field errors , or a non - ideal fixed pattern noise associated with the array , are both small and accurately estimated .",
    "it also shows that any effect from possible sub - pixel displacement between @xmath47 and @xmath48 is small comparing to the statistical uncertainty in our variance estimation , since eq .",
    "( [ eqn : varcheck ] ) does not require alignment on the sky between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the detection of sky fluctuations can be shown graphically by evaluating the variance in @xmath81 as a function of the positional shift between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : difplot ] .",
    "pixels with 75% or more observing time were used in fig . [",
    "fig : difplot ] to get more complete coverage , although this slightly increases @xmath63 above the value obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : varc ] ) .",
    "the variance is minimized when the two images are differenced according to sky coordinates , and does not appreciably decrease when differenced according to array coordinates ( correspondingly marked by the `` + '' in the @xmath82x -@xmath82y plane , fig .",
    "[ fig : difplot ] ) .",
    "the width of the minimum in the variance is consistent with the psf of the instrument .",
    "therefore the observed sky fluctuations are unlikely to arise from improperly masking the extended emission of ngc 4565 or scattered light from bright stars . as a check",
    ", we changed the masking level and found no significant change in the above results . also note that the striped pattern in the variance evaluation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : difplot ] , an artifact arising from omitting data obtained with noisy readout columns , is small ( @xmath18 5% in amplitude ) .",

    "a constant offset is removed from the summed image before auto - correlation analysis , obtaining an ensemble average of zero in @xmath54 .",
    "sky , instrument , and flat - field variance contribute to the variance of @xmath54 , whereas @xmath70 contains no sky variance , only instrument and flat - field variance . since we only analyze the central @xmath86 region",

    "we have shown the presence of statistical fluctuations that are in excess of the instrument and flat - field noise sources .",
