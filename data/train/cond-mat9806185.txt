    "( [ hallc ] ) , the term including @xmath215 or @xmath216 are vanished when the totally antisymmetric part is taken . the term including @xmath217 survives . therefore , using the ward - takahashi identity , the hall conductance is written as a topologically invariant expression of the propagator @xmath148 : @xmath218 here , the @xmath73 integral is taken over mbz . since the integral @xmath219 gives the winding number of the propagator which is a integer value under general assumptions , the hall conductance is proved to be a integer times @xmath162 whereas the filling factor is a fraction .",
    "this formula of the hall conductance is a generalization of the topological formula eq .",
    "( [ topological ] ) to the system subjected to a periodic potential .",
    "next , we consider the relation between the winding number and chern number .",
    "_ showed that the hall conductance of bloch electrons in a magnetic field is given by the chern number of the bloch function .",
    "this formula of the hall conductance leads to a surprising result in a cosine potential .",
    "that is , in the gap region of hofstadter bands , the hall conductance becomes a integer times @xmath162 in spite that the system has a fractional filling factor in the gap .",
    "furthermore , the hall conductance is changed drastically as the fermi energy is increased across subband gaps .",
    "this shows each subband carries a very large mobility .",
    "these features of the hall conductance in a cosine potential are also obtained by the streda formula@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the cosine potential the hall conductance in a periodic short - range potential is not known .",
    "taking account of recent antidot experiments , it is also important to study the hall conductance in the periodic short - range potential .    to solve these problems , we rewrite the generalized topological formula eq .",
    "( [ genetopo ] ) in a more convenient form . in computation of eq .",
    "( [ genetopo ] ) , there is a useful relation due to polyakov - wiegmann@xcite : @xmath220 where @xmath221 is defined by @xmath222 . to utilize the relation , it is convenient to regard @xmath223 as matrices of order @xmath224 .",
    "we regard that @xmath225 is diagonal with respect to the index @xmath102 and that @xmath226 is diagonal with respect to the index @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , the propagator @xmath148 is regarded as a product of three matrices,@xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ pw ] ) , the generalized topological formula leads to @xmath229 this formula is similar to that of thouless _",
    "et al._@xcite and kohmoto@xcite except that there is the second term proportional to the filling factor .",
    "the second term comes from the matrix @xmath230 .",
    "however , this term at last cancels with the boundary contribution of the first term . for the first term , we give a topological argument which is similar to the one given in @xcite .",
    "the boundary condition in bz implies that the phase of the eigenfuction varies by @xmath231 as one follows the boundary of bz counterclockwise .",
    "since bz is divided into @xmath168 mbzs , this leads to a constraint given by @xmath232 under this constraint the configuration which is singular in @xmath233 at some @xmath73 may appears for a band @xmath202 .",
    "we call this the vortex",
    ". if the vortex appears , @xmath234 is ill - defined in the entire mbz .",
    "let us assume there is a vortex at @xmath235 .",
    "we remark that there is a gauge degree of freedom in the eigenfunction .",
    "that is , the overall phase factor of the eigenfunction @xmath236 is not determined .",
    "as is well known in the description of monopole , we can define @xmath234 in the entire mbz using the gauge degree of freedom . in order to define it ,",
    "we divide mbz into two regions . one region ( @xmath237 ) does not include @xmath238 and has a boundary of mbz .",
    "the other region ( @xmath239 ) includes @xmath238 .",
    "the boundary between two regions is a closed line around @xmath238 . in @xmath239 using the gauge degree of freedom , we choose a different phase assignment which has no vortex .",
    "it is not necessary to satisfy the boundary condition when we extrapolate the wave function to @xmath237 .",
    "thus , @xmath240 is completely defined in the entire mbz .",
    "however , there is a phase mismatch at the boundary between two regions .",
    "that is , the eigenfunction @xmath241 in @xmath237 and the eigenfunction @xmath242 in @xmath239 are related as @xmath243 at the boundary . for the integral @xmath244",
    ", we can use the stokes theorem and obtain @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the closed line around @xmath238 .",
    "the first term in r.h.s . of the above equation is equal to @xmath247 due to the normalization and the boundary condition of the eigenfunction @xmath208 .",
    "the second term gives @xmath248 times a integer .",
    "this integer is called the chern number . therefore , starting from the generalized topological formula we obtain the chern number for the hall conductance : @xmath249    to compare our result with the one obtained by thouless _",
    "@xcite , we consider the correspondence between the bloch function @xmath250 and the eigenfunction @xmath251 in the von neumann lattice basis . in terms of the bloch function",
    "the energy eigenstate can be written as @xmath252 on the other hand , in the von neumann lattice basis the energy eigenstate can be written as @xmath253 both functions satisfy the same boundary condition ( except for a constant phase ) and normalization in the magnetic unit cell ( muc ) if the momentum @xmath254 is replaced by the momentum @xmath73 with the rule @xmath255 in a @xmath200 problem .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) can be identified with eq .",
    "( [ our ] ) . the chern number obtained by thouless _ et al . _",
    "is given by @xmath256 where @xmath202 is the connection 1-form written as @xmath257 substituting eq .",
    "( [ our ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ cherntknn ] ) , we obtain @xmath258 this chern number is nothing but the one in eq .",
    "( [ ourchern ] ) .",
    "therefore , the winding number of the propagator is reduced to the chern number of thouless _ et .",
    "_ if interactions are neglected .",
    "so far , we neglected interactions and consider only a periodic potential .",
    "however , in an interacting system subjected to the periodic potential the winding number formula of the hall conductance can be applied in the following way . in this system",
    "we can treat the periodic potential nonperturbatively as discussed above and treat interactions perturbatively .",
    "thus , the propagator eq .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) replaces the `` bare '' propagator . since the ward - takahashi identity and related",
    "theorems still hold , results obtained in sec.3 can be also applied in this system .",
    "therefore , the hall conductance in a gap region is written by the winding number of the propagator eq .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the winding number is the same as the chern number obtained by thouless _",
    "_ as discussed above .",
    "finally we calculate the hall conductance in the system of a periodic short - range potential . to calculate the chern number for a general periodic potential is a subtle problem .",
    "however , we can calculate the chern number for some analytically solved potentials .",
    "let us first consider the potential with @xmath259 .",
    "this is the case that each landau band does not split into subbands . in this case",
    ", the @xmath73-dependence of @xmath260 can be set as @xmath261 which satisfies the boundary condition .",
    "apparently , this has a vortex at @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we must choose another gauge for the wave function around @xmath72 .",
    "a simple choice is 1 , that is , there is no @xmath73-dependence around @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath262 , the chern number of each landau band is equal to 1 . thus , the hall conductance is @xmath162 times the number of landau bands below the fermi energy as expected .",
    "next we consider a @xmath263 case .",
    "a periodic potential with @xmath263 can be solved analytically if the number of truncated landau levels is one or two .",
    "let us consider the periodic short - range potential in the lowest landau level approximation .",
    "in this case the spectrum consists of a flat band and a lifted band .",
    "the wave function of the flat band satisfies the equation @xmath264 here , @xmath265 and mbz is the region @xmath266 .",
    "the following choice of the phase is consistent with the boundary condition of @xmath90-direction : @xmath267 at @xmath72 the upper component of the above eigenfunction has a vortex .",
    "therefore , we must choose another patch around @xmath72 .",
    "a possible choice of the eigenfunction around @xmath72 is given by @xmath268 thus there is a phase mismatch @xmath269 at the boundary .",
    "its integral along the boundary is @xmath270 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the hall conductance of the flat band is @xmath162 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation for the lifted band becomes @xmath271 its solution which is consistent with the boundary condition is @xmath272 this solution has no vortex .",
    "thus , the hall conductance of the lifted band is @xmath273 .",
    "we can see that the wannier state constructed from the flat band is relatively spread than the one from the lifted band .",
    "in the case that @xmath192 is an integer larger than @xmath274 , the spectrum also consists of a flat band and a lifted band in the lowest landau level .",
    "the eigenfunction of the lifted band @xmath275 satisfies the boundary condition and has no vortex in the mbz .",
    "thus , the hall conductance of the lifted band is @xmath273 .",
    "this result is reasonable because the lifted band becomes a set of bound states and thus has no mobility as @xmath192 becomes infinity . since it is proved that the hall conductance of the landau band is @xmath162 , the hall conductance of the flat band is @xmath162 .",
    "these results are irrespective to the lattice structure of the periodic short - range potential .",
    "we constructed three sets of one - particle states based on the von neumann lattice in a gauge - independent manner .",
    "the first one is the set of coherent sates which are localized on the sites of the von neumann lattice and not orthogonal .",
    "the second one is the set of momentum states which are extended , orthogonal and normalized with @xmath58-function .",
    "the third one is the set of wannier states which is localized on sites of the von neumann lattice and is orthonormal . using the second one we developed a field - theoretical formalism of a quantum hall system and showed the ward - takahashi identity and the topological formula of the hall conductance .",
    "this formalism was applied to a system subjected to a periodic potential .",
    "the @xmath122-fold degeneracy of the spectrum in a @xmath200 problem is easily proved using this formalism .",
    "the generalized topological formula for the hall conductance of bloch electron was obtained .",
    "the formula is written as a winding number of the propagator .",
    "relation between the winding number and the chern number was clarified . as an example we calculated the quantized hall conductance in a periodic short - range potential .    in this paper",
    "we study the system subjected to a periodic potential using the set of momentum states .",
    "we believe that our formalism is also useful to study coulomb interaction in the quantum liquid phase@xcite and the wigner crystal phase@xcite of the quantum hall system . in the wigner crystal phase ,",
    "a triangular lattice potential is generated from the mean field of the charge density . in this case , the filling factor @xmath276 is related to @xmath192 with @xmath277 . if the mean field contributes to the short - range potential with positive coefficient , the fermi energy lies in the large energy gap at @xmath278 .",
    "that is , the flat band of the lowest landau level in fig.6 is completely filled .",
    "then , @xmath279 state can be a self - consistent solution which has a large energy gap in contrast to the quantum liquid phase in which gap closes at @xmath279 .",
    "if the mean field contributes to the short - range potential with negative coefficient , the fermi energy lies in the large energy gap at @xmath277 .",
    "that is , the lifted band is completely filled .",
    "then , all states of @xmath280 can be a self - consistent solution which has a large energy gap .",
    "since the hall conductance of the lifted band is zero , the ground state in this approximation is close to the crystal .",
    "although the short - range potential is not a good approximation for the coulomb interaction , the mean field treatment starting from the short - range potential may give some insights to the wigner crystal phase of the quantum hall system .",
