    "the study for the properties of vector meson in the nuclear medium is a topic of intense interest in the nuclear physics .",
    "this topic has been pursued vigorously in recent years to determine quantitatively the mass and width of the vector meson in the nucleus .",
    "various model calculations relate the in - medium properties of vector meson with the chiral symmetry in qcd .",
    "the restoration of this symmetry in the nuclear medium predicts the reduction of vector meson mass which could be drastic in the hot and/or dense nuclear medium @xcite . using the scaling property in qcd , brow and rho @xcite",
    "have shown that the vector meson mass should drop in the nuclear medium .",
    "other model calculations , such as qcd sum rule calculations due to hatsuda et al .",
    "@xcite , vmd model calculations due to asakawa et al .",
    "@xcite , and the quark meson coupling model calculation due to saito et al .",
    "@xcite , corroborate this finding . on the other hand , the vector meson mass shift ( upward ) and width broadening in the hot and dense nuclear matter are also reported @xcite .",
    "large medium modification of the @xmath9 meson was indicated first in the enhanced dilepton yield ( between 300 and 700 mev ) in ceres and helios ultra - relativistic heavy ion collision data taken sometime around 1995 in cern - sps @xcite .",
    "the quantitative estimation of this modification could not be made in that time because of the poor statistics and resolution of the data .",
    "theoretically , these data have been found compatible with both scenarios : ( i ) the dropping of @xmath9 meson mass @xcite , and ( ii ) the many body interaction of @xmath9 meson with other hadrons in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "almost after a decade , the star experiment at rhic bnl @xcite found the decrease in @xmath9 meson mass @xmath10 mev in the analysis of the @xmath11 production data from the peripheral au+au collisions .",
    "however , the upgraded ceres experiment @xcite as well as the dimuon measurements ( in the in - in collision ) in the na60 experiment at cern @xcite reported considerable broadening in the @xmath9 meson mass distribution spectrum , but essentially no shift in mass .",
    "the interpretation of the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision data is very complicated because this reaction occurs far from the equilibrium state whereas the calculations for the hadronic parameters are done at normal nuclear density and zero temperature ( equilibrium state ) .",
    "therefore , it is more accountable to search the in - medium properties of vector meson in the normal nucleus .",
    "in fact , the modification of the vector meson is predicted large enough to observe it in the nuclear reaction with pion and photon beams @xcite . the chiral symmetry is also shown to restore partially in the normal nucleus ( specifically , inside a heavy nucleus @xcite ) . to be added ,",
    "the scaling hypothesis @xcite and qcd sum rule calculation @xcite envisage the reduction @xmath12 of vector meson mass in a nucleus .",
    "there also exist many body calculations which show the drop of mass and increase in width for the vector meson in the normal nucleus @xcite . beside these ,",
    "only width broadening @xcite , upward mass - shift @xcite and appearance of additional peaks @xcite for the vector meson in the nuclear medium are predicted by various model calculations .",
    "the modification of the vector meson in the normal nucleus has been reported by various measurements .",
    "the kek - ps e325 collaboration at kek @xcite found the enhancement in the @xmath13 yield in the @xmath14a reaction at 12 gev .",
    "this enhancement is well understood due to the reduction of the vector meson mass in the nucleus .",
    "the sub - threshold @xmath9 meson production experiment on the @xmath15 reaction , done by the tagx collaboration @xcite , reported large decrease in the @xmath9 meson mass .",
    "the @xmath9 meson polarization distribution , measured by this collaboration @xcite , corroborates this finding .",
    "the recent results , published from jefferson laboratory , show the broadening of the @xmath9 meson width in the photonuclear reaction @xcite .",
    "the mass shift of the @xmath9 meson found in this experiment is insignificant .",
    "recent past , the cbelsa / taps collaboration measured the @xmath8 invariant mass distribution spectrum to look for the medium modification of the @xmath2 meson in nb nucleus @xcite .",
    "this experiment was done at the electron stretcher accelerator ( elsa ) in bonn using the tagged @xmath16 beam of energy spread @xmath17 gev .",
    "the @xmath2 meson was detected through its decay @xmath18 . to minimize the pionic distortion on the @xmath2 meson signal , the data were taken for the @xmath5 meson kinetic energy @xmath19 larger than 150 mev .",
    "the measured spectrum for the lower @xmath2 meson momentum @xmath20 bin ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) shows distinct @xmath2 meson mass modification at @xmath22 mev , which gradually vanishes with the increase in the @xmath2 meson momentum . however , this claim is no more valid @xcite as the reanalysis of the data could not reproduced the spectral shape reported in ref .",
    "the measured distributions show broad width ( @xmath23 55 mev ) comparable to the resolution width of the detecting system used in the experimental set - up .",
    "in fact , this width is about 6.5 times larger than the free space decay width of the @xmath2 meson ( @xmath24 mev @xcite )",
    ". therefore , the width of the @xmath2 meson in a nucleus @xmath25 can be detected in this set - up if it is enhanced more than 55 mev .",
    "the present status of this topic is summarized in the recent review articles @xcite .",
    "we study microscopically the mechanism for the @xmath26 reaction on a nucleus , and compare our results with the data taken by the cbelsa / taps collaboration . in the energy region of this reaction",
    ", the elementary reaction occurring in the nucleus can be visualized as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 stands for the low energy vector mesons , i.e. , @xmath29 mesons . the qualitative analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the @xmath8 event in the elementary reaction arises distinctly due to the decay of the @xmath2 meson produced in the intermediate state .",
    "the contributions to this event from the @xmath30 and @xmath31 mesons are found negligible .",
    "therefore , we consider that the @xmath26 reaction on the nucleus proceeds through the formation of @xmath2 meson in the intermediate state .",

    "2 illustrates that the coherent addition of the amplitudes of the @xmath2 meson decaying inside and outside the nucleus enhances the cross section significantly at the peak . for @xmath140 gev / c , the @xmath2",
    "meson moves faster resulting less interaction with the nucleus .",
    "in such case , the cross section for the @xmath2 meson decaying outside the nucleus would be relatively larger than that shown in fig .  2 .",
    "therefore , the medium effect on the @xmath2 meson in nb nucleus is hardly possible under this circumstances .",
    "it should be mentioned that the @xmath2 meson decays throughout its passage inside as well as outside the nucleus .",

    "@xmath142 and @xmath25 denote the velocity and the effective width of the @xmath2 meson in the nucleus .",
    "since the width of @xmath2 meson in the free state ( i.e. , @xmath143 ) is equal to 8.43 mev , the free space @xmath2 meson decay length @xmath144 is about 5.8 fm for @xmath20 equal to 200 mev / c . this decay length would be much larger for @xmath20 equal to 400 mev / c ( @xmath145 fm for @xmath146 mev / c ) .",

    "in fact , the cross section , as mentioned above , is not sensitive to the pion nucleus interaction itself .",
    "it could be added that ct is a high energy phenomenon , i.e. , @xmath152 .",
    "large hadron formation length @xmath131 ( which occurs at higher pion momentum ) is also needed for the color transparency .",
    "therefore , ct is not expected in the low energy nuclear reaction , as considered in this manuscript .",
    "the sensitivity of the pair correlation ( pc ) to the calculated cross section is presented in fig .",

    "4 shows that the incorporation of pc increases the magnitude of the calculated cross section significantly , i.e. , by a factor of @xmath153 at the peak .",
    "the broad width appearing in the measured @xmath8 invariant mass distribution spectra can be presumed due to the large resolution width ( @xmath23 55 mev ) in the detecting system used in the experimental set - up @xcite .",
    "we incorporate this in our formalism by folding a gaussian function @xmath154 with the differential cross section given in eq .",
