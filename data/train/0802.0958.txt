    "magnetic properties of thin films and ( quasi-)two - dimensional magnetic materials are of great interest now .",
    "@xcite this interest is stimulated by recent advances in film growth techniques and numerous technological applications of magnetic films , including uses in electronics and data storage .",
    "a realistic theoretical model of low - dimensional magnetic systems must include the exchange interaction , the dipolar interaction , and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "@xcite despite its smallness the long - range dipolar interaction plays essential role in 2d magnets . in particular , it violates the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite and leads to stabilization of the long - range magnetic order at finite temperature in 2d magnets .",
    "@xcite some peculiar features have been observed recently at @xmath15 related with the dipolar interaction both in 2d and 3d heisenberg ferromagnets ( fms ) .    in 3d fm",
    "the problem of infrared singularities arose .",
    "it was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite that dipolar forces lead to strong long - wavelength fluctuations manifesting themselves in infrared divergence of the first perturbation corrections to the uniform longitudinal spin susceptibility : @xmath16 .",
    "an infrared divergent contribution to the spin - wave stiffness was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite as a result of analysis of the first @xmath1 corrections to the spin - wave spectrum .",
    "thus , the problem arose of analysis of the whole perturbation series in order to find spin - wave spectrum and longitudinal spin susceptibility at small momenta .",
    "appearance of the infrared singularities in these papers is related to the fact that the spectrum is gapless in 3d fm in the spin - wave approximation .",
    "@xcite    first perturbation corrections to the spin - wave spectrum were analyzed in classical 2d fm with dipolar forces in refs .",
    "it was found that the imaginary part of these corrections exceeds the bare gapless spectrum at small enough momenta @xmath3 .",
    "then as a result of self - consistent calculations a diffusion spin - wave mode was obtained at very small @xmath3 .",
    "it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that despite the analysis is carried out for classical 2d fm the diffusion mode should be observed also in quantum 2d fm .",
    "meantime we find that quite an unusual property of ferromagnets with dipolar forces is ignored in the previous studies that is crucial for the reported peculiarities  interaction between magnons leads to appearance of a _ gap _ in the spin - wave spectrum that renormalizes the bare gapless spectrum greatly at small momenta .",
    "thus , we obtain such gap in 3d fm in the first order of @xmath1 in our recent paper @xcite . it was found to be proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the characteristic dipolar energy , @xmath19 is the unit cell volume , @xmath20 is the angle between momentum @xmath7 and magnetization and @xmath21 is the exchange value . we show that this gap screens the infrared singularities obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and first perturbation corrections to the observables found self - consistently are small .",
    "naturally , one can expect existence of such gap in 2d fm too .",
    "it should be noted that appearance of the gap in 2d and 3d fms is quite expected because dipolar interaction due to its symmetry and long - range nature violates the goldstone theorem . besides , the spin - wave gap was observed in 2d antiferromagnet with dipolar interaction in the zeroth order of @xmath1 ( i.e. , in the spin - wave approximation ) .",
    "@xcite existence of the gap in the spectrum of 3d fm was anticipated long times ago .",
    "it is well known that within the first order of @xmath1 dipolar and pseudodipolar forces lead to anisotropic corrections to the total energy of 3d fm . @xcite as a result , directions along edges of the cube are energetically favorable in a simple cubic lattice whereas the magnetization should be parallel to a body diagonal of the cube in the face - centered cubic lattice and the body - centered cubic lattice .",
    "@xcite it has been pointed out by keffer @xcite that the anisotropic terms in the total energy of a ferromagnet should be accompanied with an `` energy shift '' in the spin - wave spectrum .",
    "we confirmed this long - standing statement for 3d fm in our previous paper @xcite and demonstrated the relation between the gap and the anisotropy at @xmath22 . a four - fold in - plane anisotropy in square 2d fm caused by quantum fluctuations",
    "was also observed before and the value of this anisotropy was investigated numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath23 .",
    "the situation is slightly different in classical fms with dipolar interaction . in particular",
    ", the ground state remains infinitely degenerate according to the rotation about the axis perpendicular to the plane in the classical 2d fm .",
    "but it is well known that in classical systems with degenerate ground states some of these states can be selected via order - by - disorder mechanism at finite temperature .",
    "@xcite order - by - disorder effect was demonstrated in 2d systems of classical spins confined to lie within the plane and coupled via ( i ) short - range dipolar - like interaction ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and ( ii ) long - range dipolar interaction ( refs .",
    "then , an in - plane anisotropy arises at finite temperature .",
    "notably , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the thermal selection of the ground state is accompanied by the appearance of the gap proportional to @xmath5 in the spin - wave spectrum originating from the spin - wave interaction and leading to the finite value of the order parameter .",
    "then , one expects also appearance of the spin - wave gap in classical 2d fm with dipolar forces .    in the present paper",
    "we carry out a comprehensive analysis of the first @xmath1 corrections to the spin - wave spectrum in 2d fm with dipolar interaction .",
    "similar to 3d fm we obtain the spin - wave gap @xmath24 in the spectrum @xmath2 which appears to be proportional to @xmath25 for @xmath8 and @xmath26 for @xmath11 and @xmath27 .",
    "this gap renormalizes greatly the bare gapless spectrum at momenta @xmath28 .",
    "the limiting case of classical spins is also discussed at @xmath29 and the gap was found to be proportional to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are values of the exchange and the characteristic dipolar energy in the classical model , respectively . it is demonstrated below that the spin - wave gap that was ignored in refs .",
    "@xcite are much larger than the energy of the diffusion mode obtained in those papers .",
    "we derive the spin - wave damping @xmath4 self - consistently and find that spin waves are well - defined quasi - particles in both quantum and classical 2d fms at small @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , we observe thermal enhancement of the damping at small momenta . in particular , in quantum 2d fm we obtain a peak in both @xmath4 and @xmath6 at @xmath33 , @xmath34 and at any given @xmath7 direction .",
    "if @xmath8 the height of the peak in @xmath6 can not axceed a value proportional to @xmath35 . in the case of large spins",
    "@xmath11 the peak in @xmath6 can not be greater than that of the classical 2d fm found at @xmath12 which height is small only _ numerically _ : @xmath13 for the simple square lattice . frustrating next - nearest - neighbor exchange coupling increases @xmath14 in classical 2d fm only slightly .",
    "we derive expressions for spin green s functions and the magnetization .",
    "the latter differs from the well - known result of ref .",
    "the effect of the exchange anisotropy is also discussed briefly .",
    "higher order corrections to the spectrum are considered and it is concluded that they are small compared to the first corrections obtained .",
    "we derive the four - fold in - plain anisotropy in the total energy of quantum 2d fm that makes directions of the magnetization along edges of the square to be energetically favorable in the simple square lattice .",
    "we also demonstrate the relation between this anisotropy and the spin - wave gap at @xmath22 as it was done in our previous paper @xcite for 3d fm .",
