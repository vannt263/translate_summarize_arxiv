    "the aim of the work presented in this talk is to analyze semi - inclusive @xmath0 decays spectra measured at @xmath0-factories , which allows the extraction of the cabibbo ",

    "this region is affected both by perturbative soft gluon radiation and by non - perturbative phenomena related to the `` fermi - motion '' of the heavy - quark inside the meson  @xcite .",
    "we take in account such phenomena with a model based on soft gluon resummation to next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy ( nnll ) and on analytic qcd coupling having no landau pole .",
    "our model , which does not contain non - perturbative free - parameters , gives a good description of experimental data of the @xmath0-factories and it allows an extraction of @xmath5 which is in agreement with the current pdg average within at most two standard deviations .",
    "let s consider first radiative decays @xmath6 : factorization and resummation of threshold logarithms in such decays leads to an expression for the event fraction of the form @xmath7 \\,\\sigma[t_s;\\alpha_s(q ) ] % \\nonumber\\\\ & + & + d_r[t_s;\\alpha_s(q)]\\ , ,   \\vspace*{-.0cm}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the inclusive radiative width , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is a short - distance , process dependent hard factor , @xmath11 is the universal qcd form factor for heavy flavor decays resumming series of logarithmically enhanced terms to any order in @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a short - distance , process dependent remainder function vanishing in the threshold region @xmath14 .    an analogous formula can be written for the semileptonic decays @xmath15 . in this three - body decay case ,",

    "decays @xmath21 and the hard scale is always of the order of the beauty mass ( @xmath22 ) , in the semileptonic decays the lepton pair can have a large invariant mass @xmath23 , implying a substantial reduction of the hard scale , which is no more fixed but it depends on the kinematics . since the hard scale @xmath24 appears in the argument of the infrared logarithms as well as in the argument of the running coupling , semileptonic spectra have in general a specific infrared structure , which is different from the invariant hadron mass distribution in the radiative decay .",
    "semileptonic spectra are naturally classified depending on whether they involve or do not involve an integration over the hard scale .",
    "the main consequence is that additional long distance effects , related to small hadronic energies , occur in semileptonic decays , which can not be extracted from the radiative decays  @xcite .",
    "the heavy flavor form factor has an exponential form in mellin space  @xcite , @xcite : @xmath25 \\bigg\\{\\!\\ ! \\int_{q^2 y^2}^{q^2 y } \\!\\!\\frac{dk_{\\perp}^2}{k_{\\perp}^2 } \\!{a}[{\\alpha_s}(k_{\\perp}^2)]\\nonumber\\\\   \\!&+&\\ !",

    "as is clear from the @xmath30 integral of eq.([expogn ] ) , semi - inclusive processes are multi - scale processes , characterized by fluctuations with transverse momenta up to @xmath24 : a jet with a relative large invariant mass @xmath31  typically @xmath32  can contain very soft partons , with transverse momenta of the order of the hadronic scale . that produces an ill - defined integration over the landau pole and the form factor acquires an unphysical imaginary part for any @xmath33 .",
    "a prescription for the low - energy behaviour of the running coupling is therefore needed to give a meaning to the formal expression in eq.([expogn ] ) : our prescription is to use an effective qcd coupling which does not present the landau pole .",
    "the standard qcd coupling @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath20 the gluon momentum , has a physical cut for @xmath36 related to the decay of a time - like gluon in secondary partons ( @xmath37 , etc . ) and an unphysical simple pole ( the landau pole ) for @xmath38 , which signals a formal breakdown of the perturbative scheme .",

    "[ coup],scaledwidth=38.0% ]    the analyticization procedure has therefore the effect of subtracting the infrared pole in @xmath43 , by means of a power - suppressed term , in a minimal way .",
    "the analytic coupling ( fig .  [ coup ] ) has a constant limit at zero momentum transfer : @xmath44 ) ; furthermore , the subtraction term does not modify the high - energy behavior because it decays as an inverse power of the hard scale : @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "higher orders in the form factors have the main effect of replacing the tree - level coupling with a time - like one evaluated at the transverse momentum of the primary emitted gluon @xmath47 by performing such integral exactly , one includes in the coupling absorptive effects related to the decay of time - like gluons .",
    "the prescription at the root of our model is simply to replace the standard coupling on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ deftime ] ) with the analytic coupling  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we have a formula similar to eq.([expogn ] ) where the effective coupling have replaced the standard one . in order to include as many corrections as possible",
    ", we make the integration over @xmath48 in eq.([expogn ] ) exactly , in numerical way ; this is possible because the time - like coupling @xmath49 does not have the landau singularity and is regular for any @xmath50 .",
    "the form factor in the physical space is obtained by inverse mellin transform @xmath51 where the constant @xmath52 is chosen so that the integration contour in the @xmath33-plane lies to the right of all the singularities of @xmath53 . in order to correctly implement multi - parton kinematics , the inverse transform from @xmath33-space back to @xmath54-space",
    "is also made exactly , in numerical way .",
