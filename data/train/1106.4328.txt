    "in the development of a thermodynamic model of the heliosphere , a crucial issue is the identification of the various physical mechanisms that play a role in determining the temperature profiles of the heliospheric plasma ions and electrons .",
    "some of the effects influencing the measured temperature profiles in the inner heliosphere are energy conservation in the spherically expanding plasma , heat conduction , coulomb collisions , and plasma heating through the dissipation of solar wind turbulence .  au @xcite . ]",
    "the incorporation of the first three of these effects is relatively well understood , but the heating of the heliospheric ions and electrons resulting from the dissipation of solar wind turbulence remains an area of active research .",
    "although a number of studies have addressed the issue of plasma heating by the dissipation of turbulence ( see @xcite for a review of previous efforts ) , with the exception of a pioneering series of papers by quataert and gruzinov @xcite , the turbulent heating of the ions and electrons separately has only recently become a focus of interest .",
    "we review here three studies that have made progress in the investigation of turbulent plasma heating and the effect of this heating on the solar wind proton and electron temperature profiles .",
    "@xcite coupled an existing turbulence transport model for the solar wind @xcite to separate radial evolution equations for the proton and electron temperatures .",
    "the temperature equations included the effects of spherical expansion , parallel electron heat flux , collisional energy exchange between protons and electrons , and separate turbulent heating rates for the ions and electrons .",
    "the kinetic dissipation mechanisms that determine the partitioning of turbulent heating between protons and electrons were not addressed in this model , so the fraction of proton - to - total turbulent heating was set to a constant value , @xmath2 .",
    "the model achieved a reasonable accounting for the temperature data measured by _",
    "ulysses _ when the effect of coulomb collisions was weak , the electron heat conduction was provided by an empirically determined function , and the partitioning of turbulent heating was taken as @xmath3 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath3 is consistent with other estimates of the fraction of proton heating @xcite .    in a complementary work , @xcite constructed a model following the internal energy evolution of the protons and electrons in the solar wind in an attempt to constrain empirically the required proton and electron turbulent heating in the solar wind .",
    "assuming isotropic maxwellian proton and electron velocity distributions with shared bulk velocity , separate equations for the conservation of energy in a spherically expanding flow for protons and electrons were constructed to incorporate the effects of energy exchange by coulomb collisions , parallel electron heat conduction , and turbulent heating of protons and electrons . using analytic fits to _ helios _ and _",
    "ulysses _ measurements for the proton temperature , electron temperature , and parallel electron heat conduction flux , the equations were solved for the turbulent proton and electron heating rates .",
    "the results were then combined to obtain an empirical estimate of the proton - to - total heating rate @xmath4 as a function of heliocentric radius , reproduced as the dashed line in figure  [ fig : qpqtot ] .    based on a theoretical model of the turbulent cascade of energy in a weakly collisional plasma @xcite",

    "the limits of validity of this heating ratio prediction were given as a constraint on the minimum scale of turbulent energy injection ( assuming an isotropic driving mechanism for the turbulence ) .",

    "this section describes the prediction of the ratio of the proton - to - total turbulent heating @xmath4 in the high - speed solar wind as a function of heliocentric radius @xmath9 using the turbulent heating prescription by @xcite .",
    "since this prescription depends on the plasma parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 , it is necessary to construct a model of the high - speed solar wind to determine the variation of these plasma parameters with heliocentric radius . in  [ sec : model ] , we describe the solar wind model . in  [ sec : turbmodel ] , we review the theoretical framework of low - frequency , anisotropic alfvnic turbulence in a magnetized , weakly collisional plasma that underlies the turbulent heating prescription .",

    "this model is used to specify , as a function of heliocentric radius @xmath9 , the two key plasma parameters required by the turbulent heating prescription : the proton plasma beta @xmath7 and the proton - to - electron temperature ratio @xmath8 .",
    "analytic fits to _ in situ _ measurements of the high - speed solar wind ( faster than 600  km s@xmath10 ) from the _ helios _ and _ ulysses _ spacecraft over the range @xmath11 were used by @xcite to generate equations for the proton and electron temperatures as function of heliocentric radius @xmath9 , @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to the proton temperature , we need to specify the form of the proton density and magnetic field strength to determine the proton plasma beta @xmath15 .",
    "following @xcite , we take a proton density of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "the empirical turbulent heating constraints calculated by @xcite used a colatitude @xmath18 to model the high - latitude _ ulysses _ measurements . for the heliocentric distances covered by this model ,",
    "the winding of the magnetic field into the parker spiral for the high - speed streams at this colatitude is relatively weak , so a simple monopolar model for the magnetic field strength is a reasonable approximation , @xmath19 with @xmath20 . using these functions for @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 in high - speed solar wind streams , we find that the proton plasma beta varies from @xmath25 at 0.29  au to @xmath26 at 5.4  au , and the proton - to - electron temperature ratio varies from @xmath27 at 0.29  au to @xmath28 at 5.4  au .      the heating prescription presented in @xcite is determined using a model for the turbulent cascade of energy in a magnetized , weakly collisional plasma @xcite .",
    "the cascade model determines the steady state form of the magnetic energy spectrum of alfvnic fluctuations , based on three primary assumptions : ( 1 ) the kolmogorov hypothesis that the energy cascade is determined by local interactions @xcite ; ( 2 ) the turbulence maintains a state of critical balance at all scales @xcite ; and ( 3 ) the linear kinetic damping rates are applicable in the nonlinearly turbulent plasma .",
    "the dependence of the nonlinear energy transfer rate on the local turbulent fluctuations in the cascade model @xcite is inspired by the following theoretical picture of low - frequency , anisotropic alfvnic turbulence in a magnetized , weakly collisional plasma @xcite .",
    "the energy of alfvnic fluctuations is injected into the turbulence isotropically at a scale much larger than the ion larmor radius , @xmath29 , corresponding to an isotropic driving wavenumber @xmath30 .",
    "since the damping of alfvnic fluctuations at this large scale by wave - particle interactions in a weakly collisional plasma is negligible , the turbulent fluctuations rise to sufficient amplitudes that nonlinear interactions between counter - propagating alfvn wave packets transfer the turbulent fluctuation energy to smaller scales .",
    "this sets up a critically - balanced , anisotropic cascade of mhd alfvn waves over all scales down to the perpendicular scale of the ion larmor radius , @xmath31 @xcite . even in a weakly collisional plasma , the dynamics of this alfvn wave cascade",
    "is rigorously described by the equations of reduced mhd @xcite . at the perpendicular scale of the ion larmor radius @xmath32 , the turbulence transitions to a critically balanced , anisotropic cascade of kinetic alfvn waves over the perpendicular scales @xmath33 .",

    "such anisotropic fluctuations are optimally described by a low - frequency expansion of kinetic theory called gyrokinetics @xcite . for alfvnic fluctuations",
    ", the anisotropy implies that , even at scales @xmath32 , the turbulent fluctuation frequency remains much smaller than the ion cyclotron frequency , @xmath38 .",
    "this is an important limit for the applicability of gyrokinetic theory , and enables one to determine quantitatively the limit of validity of the heating prescription ( see  [ sec : limits ] ) .",
    "when this limit is satisfied , the ion cyclotron resonance plays a negligible role in the collisionless damping of the turbulent fluctuations @xcite . instead ,",
    "collisionless damping of the fluctuations occurs via the both the ion and electron landau resonances at scales @xmath39 , implying that the kinetic alfvn wave cascade comprises the `` dissipation range '' of alfvnic turbulence .",
    "it is in the dissipation range that wave - particle interactions transfer the electromagnetic fluctuation energy to the ion and electron particle distribution functions .",
    "ultimately , this free energy in the particle distribution functions is transferred to small scales in velocity space through an entropy cascade @xcite , enabling arbitrarily weak collisions to thermalize this energy , increasing the entropy and leading to irreversible heating of the plasma .",
    "wave - particle interactions via the landau resonance typically peak at @xmath40 for ions and @xmath41 for electrons , so the predicted result for ion - to - electron heating @xmath42 is sensitive to the model for the nonlinear energy transfer rate in the kinetic alfvn wave cascade .",
    "although the physical model of the turbulent cascade presented here remains controversial within the heliospheric physics community , there exists significant numerical and observational evidence in support of two of its key features : ( 1 ) the turbulent frequency remains low , @xmath43 , even for @xmath33 ; and ( 2 ) the turbulence transitions to a cascade of kinetic alfvn waves at @xmath32 . a gyrokinetic numerical simulation of the transition from the mhd alfvn wave to the kinetic alfvn wave cascade at @xmath33 @xcite produces magnetic and electric energy spectra that are consistent with _",

    "measurements demonstrates that the wavevectors of the turbulent fluctuations at scales @xmath40 are aligned nearly perpendicular to the local magnetic field @xcite ; for alfvnic turbulent fluctuations , this implies low turbulent frequencies , @xmath43 , in support of the turbulent model employed in this study .      assuming a fully ionized plasma of protons and electrons with isotropic maxwellian equilibrium velocity distributions",
    ", @xcite used the turbulent cascade model @xcite to calculate the total proton and electron heating resulting from collisionless damping of the electromagnetic fluctuations of the alfvnic turbulent cascade .",
    "the model employs the linear collisionless gyrokinetic dispersion relation @xcite to determine both the linear kinetic damping rate via the landau resonances and the nonlinear energy cascade rate , so the resulting heating prescription is only valid in the gyrokinetic limit , @xmath45 .",

    "we find generally good agreement between the prediction of the turbulent heating prescription ( solid ) and the empirical estimate by @xcite ( dashed ) for @xmath57  au@xmath60  au .",
    "the disagreement at @xmath61  au , as we shall see in  [ sec : limits ] , is attributed to the violation of the gyrokinetic approximation , and , therefore , to exceeding the limits of validity of the turbulent heating prescription .",
    "the downturn in the empirical estimate of @xmath4 ( dashed ) seen at @xmath62  au may be an artifact of the bifurcation of the electron temperatures measured by _",
    "ulysses _ , as seen in figure  1(a ) of @xcite , and may not represent an actual decrease in the proton - to - total turbulent heating ratio for the high - speed wind .",
    "@xcite noted that this appeared to be a solar cycle effect , but further work will required to ascertain the significance of this downturn .",
    "we can compare our prediction of the turbulent heating based on equation  ( [ eq : fit ] ) with predictions based on simple theoretical models of the turbulent heating by @xcite , presented in figure  5 of their paper .",
    "their approach used a quasilinear framework to estimate the proton - to - electron heating rates for three particular models of the distribution of turbulent energy in wavevector space : an isotropic distribution , a slab distribution of only parallel wavevectors , and a `` two - dimensional '' ( 2d ) distribution of nearly perpendicular wavevectors .",
    "all three of the models showed significant disagreement with the empirically determined heating ratio .",
    "the slab model predicted 100% proton heating , the isotropic model overestimated the proton heating for @xmath63  au , and the 2d model significantly underestimated the proton heating at @xmath64  au . in light of these results , the agreement between the proton - to - total turbulent heating ratio predicted by equation  ( [ eq : fit ] ) and the empirical estimate in figure  [ fig : qpqtot ] is quite good .",
    "this result suggests that the turbulent cascade model @xcite captures the dominant physical mechanisms ( described qualitatively in ",
    "[ sec : turbmodel ] ) that play a role in the dissipation of solar wind turbulence at @xmath65  au .",
    "the disagreement between the prediction of the proton - to - total turbulent heating ratio ( solid ) and the empirical estimate ( dashed ) in figure  [ fig : qpqtot ] can be understood if we evaluate the limit of the regime of validity of the turbulent heating prescription ( eq .  [ [ eq : fit ] ] ) using the plasma parameters specified for the solar wind model in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the violation of the gyrokinetic approximation , or , equivalently , the point at which the proton cyclotron resonance begins to play a non - negligible role in the dynamics and dissipation of the turbulence , is cast as a requirement for the minimum dynamic range spanned by the inertial range , given by the driving scale divided by the proton larmor radius , @xmath66 .",

    "estimating isotropic driving wavenumber of the turbulence @xmath71 , however , requires the incorporation of additional empirical constraints .",
    "we interpret the isotropic driving scale @xmath72 to be the outer scale of the inertial range , and we identify this scale observationally as the break in the solar wind magnetic energy spectrum from the @xmath73 energy containing range to the @xmath74 inertial range . to estimate @xmath75 , we employ measurements of magnetic energy spectrum from _ helios 2 _ data published in figure  23 of @xcite .",
    "the frequency @xmath76 of the spectral break marking the outer scale of the inertial range measured from this figure is given in table  [ tab : k0 ] .",
    "each of these spectra are measured in the same corotating fast stream with a velocity @xmath77  km s@xmath10 ( taken from figure  17 of @xcite ) , so we may calculate the corresponding inertial range outer scale length @xmath78 , or wavenumber @xmath79 .",

    "although this fit is based solely on measurements in the inner heliosphere and may not be an accurate representation of the evolution of @xmath71 for @xmath82  au , we will see that error in the estimation of @xmath75 at @xmath83  au does not strongly impact the applicability of the turbulent heating prescription for the plasma parameters derived from this solar wind model .      using the values of @xmath84 and @xmath71 derived here , we calculate the width of the inertial range @xmath85 as a function of heliocentric radius and compare it to the constraint on @xmath86 , as shown in figure  [ fig : kx0 ] .",

    "( b ) , the value of the width of the inertial range @xmath87 for our solar wind model ( solid ) is plotted against the constraint on the minimum width of the inertial range @xmath67 for the validity of our heating model ( dashed ) .",
    "( for the heating prescription to be valid , the dashed line must fall below the solid line in this plot . ) as previously mentioned , for the plasma parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 specified by the solar wind model in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , the constraint on @xmath67 does not strongly restrict the applicability of the heating prescription for @xmath88  au .",
    "it is clear , however , that this constraint is violated for heliocentric distances @xmath89  au , signaling that the gyrokinetic representation of the turbulent dissipation mechanisms is no longer valid because the proton cyclotron resonance has begun to play a non - negligible role .",
    "significantly , this limit to the validity of our prediction for the proton - to - total turbulent heating ratio coincides with the point where our prediction ( solid ) begins to fall significantly below the empirical estimate ( dashed ) in figure  [ fig : qpqtot ] .",
    "if the contribution to proton heating from the proton cyclotron resonance becomes non - negligible for heliocentric distances @xmath90  au , a physical process not represented in the gyrokinetic turbulent heating prescription , then the result would be an empirically estimated proton - to - total heating rate that exceeds the gyrokinetic predictions at these radii , in agreement with the behavior shown in figure  [ fig : qpqtot ] .",
    "the results presented in  [ sec : results ] suggest the following consistent picture of the physical mechanisms in the high - speed solar wind that are responsible for the dissipation of the turbulence and that lead to heating of the plasma protons and electrons .    in the inner heliosphere at @xmath61",
    "au , the typically high @xmath8 and low @xmath7 conditions ( coupled with a slightly smaller width of the inertial range @xmath91 ; see panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : kx0 ] ) in high - speed streams lead to a turbulent cascade in which the small scale turbulent fluctuations can reach the proton cyclotron frequency before the turbulence is collisionlessly damped via the landau resonances .",
    "therefore , one may expect to observe greater heating of the protons than that predicted by the turbulent heating prescription given by equation  ( [ eq : fit ] ) , a result based on a gyrokinetic cascade model @xcite . by the time the turbulence has reached @xmath92  au , the decrease of @xmath8 and increase of @xmath7 ( coupled with a slight increase in the width of the inertial range @xmath91 ; see panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : kx0 ] ) , lead to plasma conditions in which the turbulent cascade no longer is affected by the proton cyclotron resonance before it is terminated by collisionless damping via the landau resonances .",
    "thus , for the range @xmath57  au @xmath58  au , the turbulent heating prescription in the gyrokinetic limit adequately represents all of the physical mechanisms needed to reproduce the empirically estimated proton - to - total turbulent heating ratio , as seen in figure  [ fig : qpqtot ] .",
    "this theoretical prediction of non - negligible proton cyclotron damping within the inner heliosphere at @xmath90  au is consistent with observational evidence .",
    "proton cyclotron damping is expected to lead to heating of the protons in the direction perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field @xcite . in the absence of such perpendicular proton heating",
    ", double adiabatic evolution would lead to a constant value of @xmath93 as a function of heliocentric radius @xcite . _",
    "helios _ observations demonstrate that the constancy of @xmath93 is indeed violated within the inner heliosphere @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the observed non - adiabatic @xmath94 does not directly identify the physical mechanism responsible .",
    "in addition to heating via the proton cyclotron resonance , several other physical mechanisms could lead to the observed behavior , including stochastic proton heating and kinetic proton temperature anisotropy instabilities .",
    "stochastic heating had been proposed as a mechanism for perpendicular proton heating for some time @xcite , and recently @xcite have put forth strong theoretical and numerical evidence for stochastic perpendicular heating of protons at low plasma @xmath95 by kinetic alfvn waves of sufficient amplitude .",
    "@xcite has used these results for stochastic heating to explain proton and minor ion perpendicular temperature observations in coronal holes . for the low plasma @xmath95 conditions found in the inner heliosphere , it is possible that this mechanism of stochastic heating could explain the perpendicular proton temperature measurements @xcite and the empirically estimated proton heating @xcite at @xmath1  au .",
    "in addition , kinetic proton temperature anisotropy instabilities in the spherically expanding solar wind flow have been shown to play a role in regulating the proton temperature anisotropy @xcite .",
    "although these instabilities can not lead to a net heating of the proton species , they can mediate a transfer of energy from the parallel to the perpendicular temperature , and vice versa , and so may be a cause of the observed deviation from double adiabatic evolution of the perpendicular temperature of the protons @xcite .",
    "there are several possible limitations of the application of the turbulent heating prescription given by equation  ( [ eq : fit ] ) to the problem of the heating due to the dissipation of solar wind turbulence .",
    "first , the model does not account for energy in compressible wave modes , such as the collisionless manifestation of the fast and slow mhd wave modes .",
    "if significant energy exists in these compressible modes , any heating due to the dissipation of these modes must be handled separately .",
    "second , the cascade model is constructed specifically for the case of balanced alfvn wave energy fluxes up and down the local magnetic field , corresponding to zero cross helicity .",
    "observations of the cross helicity in the high - latitude wind typically show non - zero normalized cross helicities varying over the range @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that a cross helicity of @xmath97 corresponds to the amplitude of anti - sunward waves only a factor of 2 larger than the sunward waves .",
    "since the typical energy cascade rates in strong mhd turbulence vary linearly with the wave amplitudes @xcite , this level of imbalance in the turbulence is unlikely to yield significant qualitative differences compared to the balanced case .",
    "third , the simplifying assumption of a fully ionized proton and electron plasma with isotropic maxwellian equilibrium velocity distributions neglects the physical variations that may arise from the more complicated equilibrium conditions often observed in the solar wind .",
    "such conditions include temperature anisotropy with respect to the local magnetic field direction ( often treated using a bi - maxwellian equilibrium distribution ) , significant deviations from a maxwellian distribution at high energy , and the presence of minor ions , particularly helium .",
    "nonetheless , we believe that the results presented here represent a significant step forward in our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for proton and electron heating in the turbulent solar wind . future work will explore the implications of these additional effects if any of them appears to impact significantly the findings presented here .",
    "in the effort to identify the physical mechanisms that govern the dissipation of solar wind turbulence and lead to heating of the solar wind protons and electrons , @xcite made a great stride forward by determining an empirical estimate of the proton - to - total plasma heating in the high - speed solar wind using _ helios _ and _ ulysses _ data .",
    "based on a turbulent energy cascade model for low - frequency , anisotropic alfvnic turbulence in a weakly collisional plasma @xcite , @xcite constructed an analytical prescription for the total proton - to - electron heating resulting from collisionless damping of the electromagnetic fluctuations of the alfvnic turbulence .    applying this turbulent heating prescription to predict the proton - to - total plasma heating in the high - speed solar wind",
    ", we obtain the following results , as shown in figure  [ fig : qpqtot ] : ( 1 ) the prediction agrees well with the empirical estimate for @xmath57  au  @xmath98  au ; ( 2 ) the predicted proton heating falls below the empirical estimate for @xmath99  au . investigating the cause of the disagreement for @xmath90  au , we see , in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : kx0 ] , that the turbulent heating prescription in the gyrokinetic limit ceases to be valid for @xmath89  au .",
    "this failure of the prescription s validity has physical meaning . in this region",
    ", the cascade model predicts that the turbulent fluctuations will reach the proton cyclotron frequency before they are damped via the landau resonances .",
    "therefore , we expect that proton cyclotron damping will cause additional proton heating , leading to an underestimate of the proton - to - total heating ratio , as seen in figure  [ fig : qpqtot ] .",
    "these results suggest the following physical picture of the turbulent cascade and plasma heating in the high - speed solar wind . in the inner heliosphere at @xmath90",
    "au , the turbulent cascade can reach the proton cyclotron frequency , leading to a level of proton heating higher than that predicted by the turbulent heating prescription in the gyrokinetic limit .",
