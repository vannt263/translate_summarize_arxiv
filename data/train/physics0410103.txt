    "the first beam test results for a new time - of - flight ( tof ) gaseous detector   dielectric resistive plate chamber ( drpc )  @xcite  were obtained in the slopes of r&d program for tof gaseous detectors intended to be used in the proposed nuclear experiment alice at lhc .",
    "drpc was developed as a frontier detector between ppc and rpc .",
    "the basic idea is to avoid large energy resolution in spark cases ( rpc feature ) , keeping high time resolution altogether with fast response provided by ppc @xcite .",
    "a dielectric layer introduced between the electrodes is covered with a surface resistivity on the gas side which lets , in case of a breakdown , to decrease or limit the spark energy by charging an elementary plate condensor , which then discharges through the resistive surface .",
    "the detector has shown stability of operation in the avalanche mode within a wide range of applied voltages .",
    "time response and energy resolution in spark events may be adjusted by varying the main electric parameters of the detector : the dielectric layer capacity and the surface resistivity .",
    "the basic detector construction used in the tests is shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "a plate condensor has external dimensions @xmath4",
    "mm@xmath3 , corresponding to the required dimensions of a single detecting cell in the alice tof system , and is several milimeters thick .",
    "one of the electrodes is made of a conducting material , the other has a resistance - dielectric - metal structure .",
    "the gas gap has been chosen to be 0.6  mm wide basing on the ppc experience as this value provides high mip registration efficiency altogether with a rather good time resolution . the gap is formed by means of ceramic spacers .",
    "accuracy requirements are similar to those for the traditional ppc : the electrodes and spacers are kept flat and parallel within the several micrometers of accuracy .",
    "the layer electrode is the crucial part of the detector . the dielectric thickness @xmath5 is determined from the condition @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the gas gap width , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the dielectric and gas dielectric constants correspondently .",
    "we used 1  mm thick al@xmath10o@xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the dielectric was covered with a thin layer of resistant material sic or tic with the volume resistivity @xmath13  @xmath14 .",
    "the outer side of this electrode was metallized through evaporation , and actually appeared to be the second condensor electrode producing the electric field responsible for the gas amplification .    in the tests",
    "double - gap detectors formed of two identical single gaps were investigated .",
    "[ options ] shows other possible options of the detector assembly .",
    "drpc has been studied as a detector for high precision and efficient time measurements on ps beams at itep and cern .",
    "@xmath15-beams with 27  gev/@xmath16 momenta , 10@xmath310@xmath17  s@xmath18 intensities , and several @xmath1 cross - section at the detector position were usually used .    trigger and start counters , made of scintillators of different sizes and modifications , and adapted for time measurements , were positioned on the same beam line .",
    "the trigger consisted of 6 to 10 counters , including those situated on precise movable platforms , which determined the space position of the beam ahead and behind the target , important for efficiency measurements , as well as the crossing point between the beam and the detector plane .",
    "the time measurement scheme included 2 start scintillation counters ( each with 2 pmts ) , it was always possible to measure their time resolution continiously during the data taking .",
    "a typical resolution of the start system equaled to 150  ps .",
    "the signal from the detector was used as the _ stop _ in the scheme .",
    "the resolution of start counters was quadratically subtracted from the time of particles flight along a fixed base . in this way the detector resolution was measured .    all trigger and timing electronics were assembled in the nim and camac standards .",
    "specially designed fast and low - noise electronics , consisting of a preamplifier , a main amplifier and a discriminator , were used for registration of signals from the gaseous detector .",
    "the scheme comes as a development of ideas previously described in  @xcite and lies beyond the slopes of this paper .",
    "various gas mixtures , based on either dme or different types of freons with normal quality , were used as working gases in the detector . a simple gas system allowed to mix gases at rather small fluxes of about several litres per hour .",
    "no special control of quality and other gas parameters was undertaken .",
    "the mixture dme + 5%cf@xmath11br was most thoroughly studied as a working gas for drpc .",
    "the best results were obtained with c@xmath10h@xmath10f@xmath19 + 15%dme and c@xmath10h@xmath10f@xmath19 + 5%isobutane + 10%sf@xmath20 .",
    "[ sevent ] represents a typical result of the drpc efficiency and time resolution measurements .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     all streamer signals have same shapes with fast rise times and large amplitudes .",
    "such working regime seems to be very attractive and must be additionally investigated .",
    "the cost of a large tof system built of many drpc cells may be estimated supposed that the single channel price is about $ 4050 , including the cost of development of new front - end and readout electronics , prototype construction , etc .",
    "this price is more than an order of magnitude less , than that which might be required for tof based on scintillation counter technique ."
