    "the properties of ultra - small metallic grains ( nanoparticles ) differ from those of bulk superconductors .",
    "larger grains are well described by the bardeen - cooper - scrieffer ( bcs ) mean - field theory  @xcite . however , as the size of the grain becomes smaller , fluctuations around the bcs mean - field solution become important .",
    "this crossover from the bcs limit to the fluctuation - dominated regime is controlled by the ratio @xmath0 between the bulk bcs gap @xmath1 and the mean level spacing @xmath2 .",
    "bcs theory is valid for @xmath3 , while fluctuations become important as this ratio decreases and becomes similar to or smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite    most of the recent interest in such ultra - small metallic grains has been motivated by experiments in the mid 1990s  @xcite in which the spectra of individual aluminum grains were determined by measuring the non - linear conductance .",
    "these spectra were found to depend on the magnetic field strength as well as the number parity of electrons in the nanoparticle .",
    "pairing correlations were clearly observed in the larger metallic particles , and the results were explained qualitatively using a number - parity projected bcs model .",
    "@xcite however , for smaller particles with nominal radii in the range @xmath5 nm it was not possible to distinguish between the spacing due to the discreteness of the single - particle spectrum and the pairing gap .",
    "the authors of ref .   emphasized that this does not mean that pairing correlations can not be observed in these samples but rather that conductance measurements might not be the appropriate tool to study the fluctuation - dominated regime .",
    "it was suggested that number - parity effects of pairing correlations in the fluctuation - dominated regime can be observed in thermodynamic quantities such as the spin susceptibility .",
    "@xcite using a combination of different methods , the authors of ref .   found a reentrant behavior of the spin susceptibility of grains with an odd number of electrons . for low temperatures they exploited an exact solution of the bcs pairing hamiltonian known as the richardson solution .",
    "@xcite results were presented for @xmath6 and @xmath7 because the richardson solution becomes less tractable at larger values of @xmath0 and/or higher temperatures .",
    "their results at high temperatures were based on the static - path approximation ,  @xcite which ignores quantum fluctuations .",
    "signatures of pairing correlations in the spin susceptibility of ultra - small grains were also studied in ref .  .    here",

    "the dimension of the many - particle space depends combinatorially on the number of single - particle levels and/or number of electrons , and a direct diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian becomes impractical .",
    "afmc scales as a power law in the number of single - particle orbitals and can be carried out in very large model spaces .",
    "recently , a different monte carlo approach that is based on canonical non - local loop update algorithm and is specific for a pairing hamiltonian was used to study metallic nanoparticles .",
    "@xcite    the thermodynamic properties of grains with chaotic single - particle dynamics are expected to display mesoscopic fluctuations because of the randomicity associated with their single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "for example , mesoscopic fluctuations in the orbital magnetization of a chaotic grain in the presence of an orbital magnetic field were studied in ref .  .",

    "<S> we use an auxiliary - field monte carlo ( afmc ) method to calculate thermodynamic properties ( spin susceptibility and heat capacity ) of ultra - small metallic grains in the presence of pairing correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this method allows us to study the crossover from bulk systems , where mean - field bcs theory is valid , to the fluctuation - dominated regime of ultra - small particles at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the computational effort at low temperatures is significantly reduced by exploiting a simple renormalization method .    </S>"
