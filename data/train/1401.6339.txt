    "since the nobel prize winning discovery of a current cosmological phase of accelerated expansion was made in 1998 @xcite , the theoretical models advanced to describe this phenomenon quickly multiplied in the literature .",
    "the simplest among these is the straightforward addition of a positive cosmological constant to the einstein field equations .",
    "although this model fits all astronomical observations , it is in tension with particle physics prediction ( the cosmological constant problem @xcite ) and cosmological considerations ( the coincidence problem @xcite ) .    a way to alleviate these problems",
    "consists in letting the cosmological constant to be dynamical .",
    "this implies the introduction of some cosmological field capable of reproducing the late time accelerated behavior mimiking in this way the effects of a cosmological constant .",
    "any physical entity which at cosmic distances provide an accelerated expansion at late times is commonly called _",
    "dark energy_. the simplest field having these properties is a canonical scalar field with a potential .",
    "dark energy models of this kind go under the name of _ quintessence _ and have been largely studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "scalar fields play an important role in cosmology since they are sufficiently simple to handle and sufficiently complicated to produce non - trivial dynamics .",
    "they are not only employed to model dark energy , but also to characterize inflation @xcite , dark matter @xcite , unified dark models @xcite and other cosmological features . for dark matter phenomenology",
    "it is usually required a vanishing pressure and that the speed of sound of adiabatic perturbations is sufficiently small to allow the formation of clusters .",
    "scalar field models proposed to unify dark matter and dark energy must thus have a dynamical equation of state evolving from dust - like to dark energy - like behavior , which can be achieved with a non canonical scalar field @xcite .",
    "generalizations and modifications of the canonical scalar field lagrangian can also lead to more complex cosmological predictions .",
    "extended models where the scalar field lagrangian is a general function of both the scalar field @xmath0 and its kinetic term , are known as @xmath1-essence theories @xcite . within this framework",
    "it is possible to obtain not only the standard dark energy evolution but also the so called _ phantom _ regime and quintessence to phantom transition , though fatal problems always arise at the level of perturbations @xcite .",
    "a phantom scalar field is identified by an equation of state ( eos ) with a negative pressure bigger than the energy density . in other words , for a scalar field eos @xmath2 , the phantom regime is identified by the condition @xmath3 , which seems to be slightly favoured by astronomical observations even after planck @xcite .",
    "the first and simplest model capable of achiving such condition consists in flipping the sign of the kinetic term of a canonical scalar field @xcite .",
    "however in this model the scalar field eos parameter is never greater than @xmath4 creating problems at early times where dark matter with vanishing pressure must dominate .",
    "scalar fields which can cross the phantom barrier at @xmath5 are usually dubbed _ quintom _ models and imply either the use of extended lagrangians , generally instable , or of two different scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the present work is devoted to study the background dynamical evolution of different scalar field models .",
    "dynamical system techniques are employed to fully determine the solutions of the cosmological equations .",
    "suitable dimensionless variables are introduced following @xcite and the phase space dynamics is analyzed using numerical methods .",
    "canonical and noncanonical scalar field lagrangians are presented and their cosmological implications are discussed .",
    "the complete cosmological background dynamics of two specific noncanonical scalar fields is obtained showing that interesting phenomenology , such as early time matter dominated solutions , scaling solutions , late time phantom acceleration , super - stiff and phantom transition eras , can be achieved .",
