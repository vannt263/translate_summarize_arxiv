    "the second factor is the polarization of the tls which is optimal when the cavity detuning is at the tls resonance with @xmath132 .",

    "however , when @xmath134 , the optimal cooling can be reached at a cavity detuning that balances the two factors , i.e. @xmath135 drifts to an intermediate value between @xmath4 and @xmath118 . in the deep dispersive regime , the noise from the reservoir of the tls is largely screened from affecting the mechanical resonator .",

    "one may ask whether the above theory gives different results from the `` simple approach '' in which the tls and its coupling are directly added into the cooling master equation for a bare mechanical resonator ? to see the differences between these two approaches , we study the steady state behavior using both the `` simple '' approach and the above theory . in fig .",

    "[ fig:3]a , the optimal cavity detuning @xmath135 in the `` simple '' approach always occurs at the first red sideband frequency ; while in the above theory , @xmath135 can shift away from the red sideband frequency by as much as @xmath139 of the mechanical resonance .",
