    "the classical trajectories @xmath4 of the family of complex @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians @xmath5 have been examined in detail @xcite .",
    "one can plot graphs of these trajectories by solving numerically the system of hamilton s differential equations @xcite @xmath6 for a given set of initial conditions @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not necessarily real numbers and the differential equations ( [ e2 ] ) are complex , the classical trajectories are curves in the complex-@xmath9 plane .",
    "it is known @xcite that for @xmath2 nearly all trajectories are closed curves .",
    "( when @xmath3 is a positive integer , it is possible for trajectories that originate at some of the turning points to run off to infinity .",
    "however , we are not interested here in these isolated singular cases .",
    "when @xmath10 , all trajectories are open curves . ) if @xmath3 is noninteger , there is a branch cut in the complex-@xmath9 plane , and we take this cut to run from @xmath11 to @xmath12 along the positive - imaginary axis .",
    "thus , it is possible for a closed classical trajectory to visit many sheets of the riemann surface before returning to its starting point .    the non - hermitian hamiltonians ( [ e1 ] ) are remarkable because when they are quantized , their spectra are entirely real and positive @xcite .",
    "moreover , these hamiltonians specify a unitary time evolution @xcite of the vectors in the associated hilbert space .",
    "thus , it is important to understand the nature of the complex classical systems underlying these quantum systems .",
    "several studies @xcite of the classical trajectories @xmath4 of complex hamiltonians were done prior to the work in ref .",
    "@xcite and from all these studies many features of the complex trajectories of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians ( [ e1 ] ) are known . however , some of the conclusions of the earlier work are wrong . for example , when @xmath2 , the @xmath0 symmetry of the quantum - mechanical theory is unbroken @xcite , and based on these studies it was believed that all classical orbits are @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "[ we say that an orbit is @xmath0 _ symmetric _ if the orbit remains unchanged upon replacing @xmath4 by @xmath13 .",
    "such an orbit has mirror symmetry under reflection about the imaginary axis on the principal sheet of the riemann surface . ] while the equations of motion ( [ e2 ] ) exhibit @xmath0 symmetry , it is not required that the solutions to these equations also exhibit @xmath14 symmetry , but in all previous numerical studies only @xmath0-symmetric orbits were found .",
    "we will show in this paper that there are also rare trajectories that are _ not _",
    "@xmath0 symmetric , and we will argue that these new kinds of orbits explain the strange fine - structure behavior of the periods of the orbits that was first reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] we review briefly the earlier work on classical trajectories .",
    "then , in sec .  [ s3 ] we present new findings that help us to grasp the underlying reasons for the appearance of the elaborate and intricate structures of the classical trajectories that were described in ref .  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] we make some concluding remarks .",
    "to construct the classical trajectories , we note that the hamiltonian in ( [ e1 ] ) is a constant of the motion .",
    "this constant ( the energy @xmath15 ) may be chosen to be 1 because if @xmath15 were not 1 , we could rescale @xmath9 and @xmath16 to make @xmath17 . because @xmath18 is the time derivative of @xmath19",
    "[ see ( [ e2 ] ) ] , the trajectory @xmath4 satisfies a first - order differential equation whose solution is determined by the initial condition @xmath7 and the sign of @xmath20 .",
    "the simplest version of the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) is the harmonic oscillator , which is obtained by setting @xmath21 . for the harmonic oscillator the turning points , which are the solutions to @xmath22 , lie at @xmath23 . if we chose @xmath7 to lie between these turning points , then the classical trajectory oscillates between the turning points with period @xmath24 .",
    "however , while the harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian is real , it still has complex classical trajectories . to generate one of these trajectories , we choose a value for @xmath25 that does not lie between @xmath26 and find that the resulting trajectories are ellipses in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "the foci of these ellipses are the turning points at @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the period for all of these closed orbits is @xmath24 .",
    "the constancy of the period is due to the cauchy integral theorem applied to the path integral that represents the period .",
    "the ( closed ) contour of integration encircles the square - root branch cut that joins the turning points .",
    "as @xmath3 increases from 0 , the turning points at @xmath27 ( and at @xmath28 ) rotate downward and clockwise ( anticlockwise ) into the complex-@xmath9 plane .",
    "these turning points are solutions to the equation @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath30 , this equation has many solutions that all lie on the unit circle and have the form @xmath31 ( this notation differs slightly from that used in ref .",
    "these turning points occur in @xmath0-symmetric pairs ( pairs that are symmetric when reflected through the imaginary axis ) corresponding to the @xmath32 values @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and so on .",
    "we label these pairs by the integer @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) so that the @xmath37th pair corresponds to @xmath39 . the pair of turning points on the real-@xmath9 axis for @xmath21 deforms continuously into the @xmath40 pair of turning points when @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath3 is rational , there are a finite number of turning points in the complex-@xmath9 riemann surface .",
    "for example , when @xmath42 , there are 5 sheets in the riemann surface and 11 pairs of turning points .",
    "the @xmath40 pair of turning points are labeled @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the @xmath45 pair are labeled @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and so on .",
    "the last ( @xmath48 ) pair of turning points are labeled @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "these turning points are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    as @xmath3 increases from 0 , the elliptical complex trajectories for the harmonic oscillator begin to distort",
    ". however , the trajectories remain closed and periodic except for special singular trajectories that run off to complex infinity .",
    "these singular trajectories only occur when @xmath3 is an integer .",
    "all of the orbits discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite are @xmath0 symmetric , and it was firmly believed that all closed periodic orbits are @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "( we will see that this is not so , and that non-@xmath0-symmetric orbits are crucial in understanding the observed rapid variation in the periods of the complex orbits as @xmath3 varies slowly . )    in ref .",
    "@xcite many complex trajectories @xmath4 were examined , some having a rich topological structure .",
    "some of these trajectories visit many sheets of the riemann surface .",
    "the classical orbits exhibit fine structure that is exquisitely sensitive to the value of @xmath3 .",
    "small variations in @xmath3 can cause huge changes in the topology and in the periods of the closed orbits . depending on the value of @xmath3 , there are orbits having short periods as well as orbits having long and possibly arbitrarily long periods ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] delineates three regions of @xmath3 for which an orbit that begins at the @xmath47 turning point exhibits a specific kind of behavior . when @xmath51 ( region i ) , the period is a smooth decreasing function of @xmath3 ; when @xmath52 ( region ii ) , the period is a rapidly varying and choppy function of @xmath3 ; when @xmath53 ( region iii ) , the period is once again a smooth and decreasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "for some values of @xmath3 in region ii the period is extremely long .",
    "thus , it is difficult to see the behavior of the period in regions i and iii in fig .",
    "we have therefore plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the period for these slowly varying regions .    for a trajectory beginning at the @xmath54 turning point , the period as a function of @xmath3",
    "again exhibits these three types of behaviors .",
    "the period decreases smoothly for @xmath55 ( region i ) .",
    "when @xmath56 ( region ii ) , the period becomes a rapidly varying and noisy function of @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath57 ( region iii ) the period is once again a smoothly decaying function of @xmath3 .",
    "these behaviors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . again , because it is difficult to see the dependence of the period in regions i and iii when region ii is included , we display the period for @xmath58 for @xmath3 in regions i and iii in fig .",
    "the trajectory terminates at the @xmath59 turning point except when @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "broken - symmetry orbits occur only at isolated points in region ii .",
    "figures [ fig2 ]  [ fig5 ] illustrate a general pattern that holds for all @xmath37",
    ". for classical orbits that oscillate between the @xmath37th pair of turning points , there are always three regions .",
    "the domain of region i is @xmath60 , the domain of region ii is @xmath61 , and the domain of region iii is @xmath62 .",
    "as @xmath3 varies , the turning points move in a characteristic fashion for each of these three regions ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) . when @xmath21 , the turning points lie on the real axis . as @xmath3 increases ,",
    "the turning points rotate into the complex-@xmath9 plane .",
    "just as @xmath3 reaches the upper edge of region i , the turning points rotate through an angle of @xmath63 and now lie on the imaginary axis . as @xmath3 continues to increase ,",
    "the turning points continue to rotate around @xmath64 , and may encircle the origin many times .",
    "just as @xmath3 reaches the upper boundary of region ii , the turning points again lie on the real axis . finally , as @xmath3 moves from the lower edge to the upper edge of region iii ( @xmath65 )",
    ", the turning points again rotate through an angle of @xmath63 and lie on the negative imaginary-@xmath9 axis .    in general",
    ", the period of any classical orbit depends on the specific pairs of turning points that are enclosed by the orbit and on the number of times that the orbit encircles each pair . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , any orbit can be deformed to a much simpler orbit of exactly the same period .",
    "this simpler orbit connects two turning points and oscillates between them rather than encircling them . for the elementary case of orbits that enclose only the @xmath40 pair of turning points , the formula for the period of the closed orbit is @xmath66 the derivation of ( [ e4 ] ) is straightforward . the period @xmath67 is given by a closed contour integral along the trajectory in the complex-@xmath9 plane .",
    "this trajectory encloses the square - root branch cut that joins the @xmath40 pair of turning points .",
    "this contour can be deformed into a pair of rays that run from one turning point to the origin and then from the origin to the other turning point .",
    "the integral along each ray is easily evaluated as a beta function , which is then written in terms of gamma functions .",
    "equation ( [ e4 ] ) is valid for all @xmath2 .    when the classical orbit encloses more than just the @xmath40 pair of turning points , the formula for the period of the orbit becomes more complicated @xcite . in general , there are contributions to the period integral from many enclosed pairs of turning points .",
    "we label each such pair by the integer @xmath68 .",
    "the general formula for the period of the topological class of classical orbits whose central orbit terminates on the @xmath37th pair of turning points is @xmath69 in this formula the cosines originate from the angular positions of the turning points in ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath70 are all nonnegative integers .",
    "the @xmath68th coefficient is nonzero only if the classical path encloses the @xmath68th pair of turning points .",
    "each coefficient is an _ even _ integer except for the @xmath71 coefficient , which is an odd integer .",
    "the coefficients @xmath72 satisfy @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number of times that the central classical path crosses the imaginary axis . equation ( [ e7 ] ) truncates the summation in ( [ e6 ] ) so that it contains a finite number of terms .    as we can see in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] , for an orbit that oscillates between the @xmath37th pair of turning points ( @xmath75 ) the classical behavior undergoes abrupt transitions as @xmath3 is varied smoothly in region ii . in region",
    "ii there are narrow patches in which the period of the orbit is rapidly varying which are sandwiched between small regions of quiet stability . at the boundaries of the slowly varying and rapidly varying regions",
    "there are transitions in the topologies and periods of the classical orbits",
    ". we can understand from ( [ e6 ] ) how there can be rapid variations in the period of the orbit .",
    "the summation in ( [ e6 ] ) can vary rapidly as a function of @xmath3 because small changes in @xmath3 can cause fluctuations in the topology of the orbit .",
    "if the orbit suddenly encloses many more pairs of turning points , the value of the period may fluctuate wildly .",
    "[ note that abrupt changes in the periods of the orbits can not occur for the trajectories joining the @xmath40 pairs of turning points because @xmath76 in ( [ e4 ] ) is a smoothly decreasing function for all @xmath2 . ]",
    "we now demonstrate that the abrupt changes in the topology and the periods of the orbits that we observe for @xmath3 in region ii are associated with the appearance of orbits having spontaneously broken @xmath0 symmetry . in region",
    "ii there are short patches where the period is relatively small and is a slowly varying function of @xmath3 .",
    "these patches are bounded by special values of @xmath3 for which the period of the orbit suddenly becomes extremely long . from our numerical studies of the orbits connecting the @xmath37th pair of turning points , we believe that there are only a finite number of these special values of @xmath3 and that these values of @xmath3 are always _",
    "rational_. furthermore , we have discovered that at these special rational values of @xmath3 , the closed orbits are _ not _ @xmath0-symmetric and we say that such orbits exhibit _ spontaneously broken _ @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "some special values of @xmath3 at which spontaneously broken @xmath0-symmetric orbits occur are indicated in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] by short vertical lines below the horizontal axis .",
    "these special values of @xmath3 always have the form @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a multiple of 4 and @xmath79 is odd .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] displays an orbit having spontaneously broken @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this orbit occurs when @xmath80 .",
    "the orbit starts at the @xmath54 turning point , but it never reaches the @xmath0-symmetric turning point @xmath59 .",
    "rather , the orbit terminates when it runs into and is reflected back from the complex conjugate @xmath81 turning point [ see ( [ e3 ] ) ] .",
    "thus , a broken-@xmath0-symmetric orbit is a failed @xmath0-symmetric orbit .",
    "the period of the orbit is short ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this orbit is not @xmath0 ( left - right ) symmetric but it does possess complex - conjugate ( up - down ) symmetry . in general , for a non-@xmath0-symmetric orbit to exist , it must join or encircle a pair of complex - conjugate turning points .",
    "if we change @xmath3 slightly , @xmath0 symmetry is restored and one can only find orbits that are @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath83 , we obtain the complicated orbit in fig .",
    "the period of this orbit is large ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "it is possible to have more than one kind of broken-@xmath0-symmetric orbit for a given rational value of @xmath3 .",

    "it originates at the @xmath99 turning point , but it never reaches the @xmath14-symmetric @xmath86 turning point .",

    "@xcite provides a heuristic explanation of how very long - period orbits arise . in order for a classical trajectory to travel a great distance in the complex plane",
    ", its path must slip through a forest of turning points .",
    "when the trajectory comes under the influence of a turning point , it usually executes a huge number of nested u - turns and eventually returns back to its starting point .",
    "however , for some values of @xmath3 the complex trajectory may evade many turning points before it eventually encounters a turning point that takes control of the particle and flings it back to its starting point .",
    "we speculated in ref .",
    "@xcite that it may be possible to find special values of @xmath3 for which the classical path manages to avoid and sneak past all turning points .",
    "such a path would have an infinitely long period .",

    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite we could not provide an explanation of why the period of a closed trajectory , as a function of @xmath3 , is such a wildly fluctuating function .",
    "we have shown here that for special rational values of @xmath3 the trajectory bumps directly into a turning point that is located at a point that is the complex conjugate of the point from which the trajectory was launched .",
    "this turning point reflects the trajectory back to its starting point and prevents the trajectory from being @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "trajectories for values of @xmath3 near these special rational values have extremely different topologies and thus have periods that tend to be relatively long .",
