    "recent observations provide increasingly strong evidence that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) of mass @xmath6 exist and that they are the central engines that power active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quasars ( rees 1998 , 2001 )",
    ". the dynamical formation of smbhs , as well as the inspiral , collision and merger of binary smbhs , are promising sources of long - wavelength gravitational waves for the proposed laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) ( thorne 1995 ; schutz 2001 ) . however , the scenario by which smbhs form is still very uncertain ( see , e.g. , rees 1984 , for an overview ) .",
    "one promising route is the collapse of a supermassive star ( sms ) .",
    "once they form out of primordial gas , sufficiently massive stars will evolve in a quasistationary manner via radiative cooling , slowly contracting until reaching the point of onset of relativistic radial instability . at this point ,",
    "such stars undergo catastrophic collapse on a dynamical timescale , leading to the formation of a smbh ( bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich & novikov 1966 ; zeldovich & novikov 1971 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .    because most objects formed in nature have some angular momentum , rotation is likely to play a significant role in the quasistationary evolution , as well as the final collapse of a sms .",
    "the slow contraction of even a slowly rotating sms will likely spin it up to the mass  shedding limit , because such stars are so centrally condensed . at the mass  shedding limit , matter on the equator moves in a keplerian orbit about the star , supported against gravity by centrifugal force and not by an outward pressure gradient .",
    "baumgarte & shapiro ( 1999 ) recently performed a detailed numerical analysis of the structure and stability of a rapidly rotating sms in equilibrium . assuming the viscous or magnetic braking timescale for angular momentum transfer is shorter than the evolution timescale of a typical sms ( zeldovich & novikov 1971",
    "; shapiro 2000 ) , the star will settle into rigid rotation and evolve to the mass  shedding limit following cooling and contraction .",
    "they found that all stars at the onset of quasi - radial collapse have an equatorial radius @xmath7 and a nondimensional spin parameter @xmath8 .",
    "here @xmath9 , @xmath0 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are spin , gravitational mass , light velocity and gravitational constant .",
    "( hereafter we adopt gravitational units and set @xmath12 ) . because of the large value of @xmath13 , it was uncertain whether the rotating sms would collapse directly to a black hole and/or form a disk . because of the growth of @xmath14 during collapse ( where @xmath15 is the rotational kinetic energy and @xmath16 is the gravitational potential energy ) , it was unclear whether the collapse would trigger the growth of bars or other nonaxisymmetric instabilities .",
    "we therefore investigated the collapse of a rotating sms with a @xmath17 post - newtonian ( pn ) hydrodynamic simulation ( saijo et al .",
    "we found that the collapse proceeds nearly homologously and axisymmetrically and inferred that a smbh is likely to be formed , with some gas remaining outside the hole .",
    "shibata & shapiro ( 2002 ) then performed simulations of the collapse using an axisymmetric code in full general relativity .",
    "we showed conclusively that a black hole forms at the center and determined that the mass of the hole contains about @xmath18 of the total mass of the system and has a spin parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the remaining gas forms a rotating disk about the nascent hole .    guided by our numerical simulations",
    ", we show here that the final black hole mass and spin can be calculated _ analytically _ ( up to quadrature ) from the stellar density and angular momentum profiles in the progenitor sms .",
    "the calculation provides a simple physical explanation for the important finding that a smbh formed from the collapse of a rotating sms is always born with a `` ready  made '' disk that can provide fuel for accretion to power an energy source .",
    "our analysis relies on several explicit assumptions , all of which we expect to hold to high accuracy in smss .",
    "in particular , we assume that the sms is    1 .",
    "dominated by thermal radiation pressure ; 2 .   fully convective",
    "; 3 .   uniformly rotating ; 4 .",
    "governed by nearly newtonian gravitation ; 5 .   described by the roche model in the outer envelope .    for large masses",
    ", the ratio between radiation pressure , @xmath20 , and gas pressure , @xmath21 , satisfies @xmath22 ( see , e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky 1983 , eqs .  ( 17.2.8 ) and  ( 17.3.5 ) ) ; here the coefficient has been evaluated for a composition of pure ionized hydrogen .",
    "for smss with @xmath23 , we can therefore neglect the pressure contributions of the plasma in determining the equilibrium profile , even though the plasma can be important for determining the stability of the star when it is rotating sufficiently slowly ( zeldovich & novikov 1971 ; and shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) . a simple proof that smss are convective in this limit is given in loeb & rasio ( 1994 ) .",
    "this result implies that the photon entropy per baryon , @xmath24 is constant throughout the star , and so therefore is @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the radiation density constant , @xmath27 is the baryon density , and @xmath28 is boltzmann s constant . as a consequence ,",
    "the equation of state of a sms is that of an @xmath29 polytrope : @xmath30^{1/3 } = { \\rm const},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the atomic mass unit and @xmath32 is the mean molecular weight ( cf .",
    "clayton 1983 , eq .",
    "2 - 289 ; note that clayton adopts a different definition of @xmath33 , which is related to ours by @xmath34 ) .",
    "in fact , our results depend only on the assumption that the star is an @xmath29 polytrope , and not on the origin of the internal pressure .",
    "the third assumption , that the star is uniformly rotating , is probably the most uncertain of our assumptions .",
    "nevertheless , it has been argued that convection and magnetic fields provide an effective turbulent viscosity which dampens differential rotation and brings the star into uniform rotation ( bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich & novikov 1967 ; wagoner 1969 ; shapiro 2000 ; for an alternative , see new and shapiro 2001 ) .",
    "uniformly rotating configurations were adopted as initial configurations in shibata and shapiro ( 2002 ) , whose numerical results we are attempting to corroborate .",
    "we assume that gravitational fields in the progenitor star are sufficiently weak so that we can apply newtonian gravity in analyzing its envelope .",
    "smss at the onset of collapse have equatorial radii @xmath35 ( baumgarte & shapiro 1999 ) , so that this assumption certainly holds .",
    "relativistic corrections are crucial for the stability of smss , but can be neglected in the analysis of the equilibrium state .    finally , the roche approximation provides a very accurate description of the envelope of a rotating stellar model with a soft equation of state , as in the case of an @xmath29 polytrope ( for numerical demonstrations , see , eg , papaloizou & whelan 1973 and baumgarte & shapiro 1999 ) . since our analysis is based on this approximation , we will briefly review it together with some of its predictions in the following section .",
    "we assume that the collapse proceeds    1 .",
    "axisymmetrically ; 2 .",
    "adiabatically .    our previous 3d simulation in pn gravitation ( saijo et al .",
    "2002 ) allowed for the growth of nonaxisymmetric perturbations , but none were observed . hence the assumption of axisymmetry , which was the basis of the fully relativistic simulation of shibata & shapiro ( 2002 ) , appears to be justified .",
    "cooling by photon and neutrino emission can be ignored on a dynamical timescale ( linke et al 2001 ) , hence the collapse is essentially adiabatic .",
    "the collapse will be accompanied by a burst of gravitational radiation which may be detectable by lisa",
    ". however , the fractional loss of mass  energy is sufficiently small that it can be ignored in determining the black hole mass ( shibata & shapiro 2002 ) ; angular momentum is strictly conserved , as gravitational waves carry off no angular momentum in axisymmetry .",
    "stars with soft equations of state are extremely centrally condensed : they have an extended , low density envelope , while the bulk of the mass is concentrated in the core . for an @xmath29 polytrope , for example",
    ", the ratio between central density to average density is @xmath36 .",
    "the gravitational force in the envelope is therefore dominated by the massive core , and it is thus legitimate to neglect the self - gravity of the envelope . in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ", @xmath37 this neglect amounts to approximating the newtonian potential @xmath38 by @xmath39 in  ( [ hydro ] ) we introduce the centrifugal potential @xmath40 , which , for constant angular velocity @xmath41 about the @xmath42-axis , can be written @xmath43 integrating eq .",
    "( [ hydro ] ) yields the bernoulli integral @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant of integration and @xmath46 is the enthalpy per unit mass .",
    "evaluating eq .",
    "( [ bernoulli ] ) at the pole yields @xmath47 since @xmath48 on the surface of the star and @xmath49 along the axis of rotation . in the following",
    "we assume that the polar radius @xmath50 of a rotating star is always the same as in the nonrotating case .",
    "this assumption has been shown numerically to be very accurate ( e.g. , papaloizou & whelan 1973 ) .",
    "the mass of the star is hardly changed from its value in spherical equilibrium , @xmath51 where the lane - emden factor for an @xmath29 polytrope is given by @xmath52 ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "a rotating star reaches mass shedding when the equator orbits with the kepler frequency . using eqs .",
    "( [ centrif ] ) and  ( [ bernoulli ] ) , it is easy to show that at this point the ratio between equatorial and polar radius is @xmath53 the corresponding maximum orbital velocity is @xmath54 ( zeldovich & novikov 1971 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .    inserting eqs .",

    "the stellar surface is the boundary along which @xmath57 , and is thus defined by the curve @xmath58 given by @xmath59 the solution to this cubic equation is given by @xmath60 ( r. cooper , private communication ) .    2.5 in",
    "consider the implosion of matter from the envelope onto the central black hole formed from the collapse of the centrally condensed interior region .",
    "if the specific angular momentum of the imploding envelope matter is below @xmath61 , the specific angular momentum of a particle at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) about the hole , the matter will be captured .",
    "if the angular momentum of the infalling matter exceeds @xmath61 , the matter will escape capture and continue to orbit outside the hole , forming a disk .",
    "this capture criterion is well - supported by the numerical simulation of shibata & shapiro ( 2002 ) , where the capture of fluid in noncircular orbits with @xmath62 was demonstrated to be negligible .",
    "this criterion suggests a simple iterative scheme for calculating the final mass and spin of the hole and disk from the initial stellar density and angular momentum profile .",
    "first , guess the mass and spin of the hole , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for our initial guess",
    ", we shall take a black hole that has consumed all the mass and angular momentum of the star , so that @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "next , use the initial stellar profile to `` correct '' this guess by calculating the escaping mass and angular momentum of the outermost envelope with specific angular momentum exceeding @xmath61 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we note that the value @xmath61 depends on @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we then `` correct '' the black hole mass and spin by deducting the values of the escaping mass and angular momentum of the envelope material from the guessed values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we recompute @xmath61 for the `` corrected '' black hole mass and spin , and repeat the calculation of the escaping envelope mass and angular momentum until convergence is achieved .",
    "the calculation described above relies on the theorem that for an axisymmetric dynamical system , the specific angular momentum spectrum , i.e. , the integrated baryon rest - mass of all fluid elements with specific angular momentum @xmath67 less than a given value ( e.g. , @xmath61 ) is strictly conserved in the absence of viscosity ( stark & piran 1987 ) . any viscosity ,",
    "if present , is expected to be unimportant on dynamical timescales , as required by the theorem .    for a kerr black hole of mass @xmath63 and spin parameter @xmath68 ,",

    "clearly , the infalling gas corotates with the black hole .",

    "( [ rp ] ) and where once again the integral is performed over all cylindrical shells in the star with @xmath75    the mass and angular momentum of the black hole can then be determined from eqs .",
    "( [ dm ] ) and  ( [ dj ] ) according to @xmath83 and @xmath84 once the iteration of eqs .",
    "( [ jisco ] )   ( [ z2 ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ dm ] ) ,  ( [ mh ] ) and  ( [ jh ] ) converges , the mass of the ambient disk can be found from @xmath85    convergence to better than 1% is achieved after only four iterations .",
    "we find that @xmath86 .",
    "we obtain a black hole mass @xmath87 and black hole spin @xmath88 , and a disk mass @xmath89 .",
    "these values are consistent with those inferred from the numerical simulation of shibata & shapiro ( 2002 ) : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the differences are well within the numerical accuracy of the dynamical integrations in the simulation .",
    "we have considered a smbh formed by the collapse of a radially unstable , uniformly rotating sms of mass @xmath0 spinning at the mass  shedding limit .",
    "we calculated that the black hole has a mass @xmath90 and a spin @xmath91 .",
    "most significant , we found that at birth such a black hole will be automatically embedded in a substantial disk of mass @xmath92 . a disk forms even though the total angular momentum of the star at the onset of collapse is @xmath93 , below the kerr limit .",
    "we have also calculated the black hole and disk parameters for unstable smss which , at the onset of collapse , are spinning more slowly than the angular frequency at break  up ( i.e. mass  shedding ) .",
    "we find that the parameters are very insensitive to the ratio @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is given by eq .",
    "( [ shedd ] ) , over the range @xmath96 .",
    "the reason is that for small @xmath41 , a rotating sms destabilizes at large @xmath82 ( @xmath97 ) with a value of @xmath93 nearly independent of @xmath98 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath99 is nearly unchanged , and as a result , the final black hole and disk parameters do not vary significantly as @xmath98 decreases .",
    "( for sufficiently low spin rates , the effects of thermal gas pressure compete with rotation to determine the onset of stability and must be included ) . nevertheless , we believe , on evolutionary grounds , that it is most likely that a sms will be spinning near the break  up value at the onset of collapse ( baumgarte & shapiro 1999 ) .",
    "the nascent disk is fairly massive .",
    "such a massive , rotating disk may be dynamically unstable to nonaxisymmetric instabilities .",
    "if the disk deforms , it could emit long wavelength , quasi - periodic gravitational waves with a frequency of about @xmath100 hz , which might be detectable by lisa .    at birth",
    ", the disk will be hot and thick , radiation dominated , and will extend from radius @xmath101 at the outer edge in the equatorial plane all the way down to the horizon .",
    "subsequently , the matter in the disk will likely cool by both photon and neutrino emission and flatten . under the influence of viscosity",
    ", the gas will diffuse outwards in the outermost region , transporting angular momentum away from the inner region . at the same time , gas in the inner region will accrete onto the central black hole , increasing its mass and powering a source of luminous energy .",
    "the lifetime of the disk @xmath102 may be estimated crudely by speculating that the accretion eventually will settle into a steady state , generating photons at the eddington luminosity at @xmath103 efficiency : @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "accordingly , we have @xmath106 , or @xmath107 the above estimate for @xmath102 is independent of @xmath0",
    ". however , it may be off by a considerable factor : a lower luminosity will increase the disk lifetime , while a lower efficiency ( e.g , an efficiency characterizing an adaf disk ; narayan & yi 1994 ) or an enhancement in the total luminosity via the addition of neutrino cooling , could decrease the lifetime . moreover , the disk at black hole birth may comprise far more material than the gas which escapes capture during the final implosion .",
    "prior to undergoing collapse , a rotating sms will likely evolve along a mass  shedding sequence as it cools and contracts , provided the stellar viscosity and/or magnetic braking proves sufficient to enforce uniform rotation ( baumgarte & shapiro 1999 ) . in this case , the secular cooling and contraction phase will be accompanied by mass loss , and the gas which is ejected then might already form an extensive , ambient disk prior to collapse .",
    "finally we note the possibility that such a massive disk around the hole may suffer a global `` runaway '' instability that may cause a more rapid destruction of the disk than implied by steady - state accretion ( abramowicz et al . 1983 ; nishida et al . 1996",
    "; nishida & eriguchi 1996 ) .",
    "these are important issues which are ripe for further analysis .",
    "the calculation performed here applies to _ any _ marginally unstable @xmath29 polytrope rotating at the mass  shedding limit .",
    "the results are independent of stellar mass or the source of internal pressure .",
    "the method should be applicable for estimating the black hole and disk parameters for the collapse of other types of stars with different equations of state , initial density and rotation profiles .",
    "for example , a preliminary calculation indicates that for a marginally unstable star uniformly rotating at break  up speed , the mass fraction that avoids collapse and forms a disk falls sharply as the polytropic index of the star drops below @xmath29 .",
    "the reason is that such stars are more compact at the onset of collapse , with smaller values of @xmath82 and , hence , less extended envelopes .",
    "this may provide a qualitative explanation for the results of previous simulations in full general relativity for collapse of rotating neutron stars modeled as @xmath108 polytropes ( shibata , baumgarte & shapiro , 2000 ; shibata , 2000 ) .",
    "we hope to provide further examples in the future .",
