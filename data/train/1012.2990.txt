    "the origin of oscillatory behaviour of segmentation clock genes is believed to be due to negative feedback genetic regulation of their own products @xcite .",
    "for example , in vertebrate developement , periodic formation of somites during presomitic mesoderm is considered to be responsible to exhibit oscillatory expression by these genes during sometogenesis and their period of oscillation is very close to the period of segmentation@xcite .",
    "it has been reported that during this signal processing neighbouring cells are in contact and these cells communicate among the neighbouring cells showing synchronization in the dynamical variables @xcite .",
    "there have been various theoretical studies regarding the dynamical stability , periodicity and synchronization of the various oscillating variables of segmentation clock @xcite . since synchronization and oscillation in the clock gene regulations",
    "are believed to be responsible for somite boundary , these properties are considered to be essential in segmentation process @xcite . if a group of such cells are considered , signal processing among the neighbouring cells are done via delta - notch signaling process to achieve synchronization among them @xcite . however , since the delta proteins can not diffuse from one cell to another , the incorporation of delta - notch coupling in the theoretical models so far developed is still questionable .",
    "one attempt in this direction without considering time delay was to introduce a coupling term in the model associated with activation rate of delta - notch signaling which enable to control the fluctuation in delta protein concentration in its neibouring cells @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the cells in this coupling mechanism exhibit phase synchrony in one and two dimensional array of such cells @xcite .    in this work we focuss on some issues",
    "namely , measure of phase synchrony among the cells and generalization of coupling mechanism into some more real situation . in the section",
    "ii , we study the model of segmentation clock gene expression due to uriu et.al .",
    "we generalized the model in three dimensional situation with coupling mechanism .",
    "then we explain various methods to identify phase synchrony among the coupled cells .",
    "the results and discussions of our simulation results are presented in section iii .",
    "we draw some conclusions based on our results in section iv .",
    "[ fig1 ]        [ fig2 ]",
    "in vertebrate sometogenesis , the expression of @xmath0 gene in single cell model with and without time delay is essential in order to generate oscillatory behavior of the segmentation clock genes @xcite . here , we consider a model in which simple kinetics of mrna , protein in cytoplasm and protein in nucleus are considered without taking into account any time delay @xcite .",
    "the detail molecular reaction pathways are shown in fig . 1 .    [ fig3 ]    , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath3 and 0.7 .",
    "the other values of the parameters used in the simulation are ; @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17,@xmath18 @xcite.,height=170 ]    in this model @xcite , if @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 indicate concentrations of @xmath23 mrna , @xmath23 protein in cytoplasm , @xmath23 protein in nucleus and delta protein respectively in a single cell , then the time evolution of these variables without considering time delay in describing the kinetics in the cell are given by , @xmath24 where , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the parameters in the differential equations are given as follows : @xmath31 is the basal transcription rate , @xmath32 indicates the activation rate due to delta - notch signaling , @xmath33 is maximum degradation rate of @xmath23 mrna , @xmath34 refers to translation rate of her protein , @xmath35 is the maximum degradation rate of @xmath23 protein in cytoplasm , @xmath36 indicates transportation rate of @xmath23 protein , @xmath37 is maximum degradation rate of @xmath23 protein in nucleus , @xmath38 is the sysnthesis rate of delta protein , @xmath39 is the maximum degradation rate of delta protein , @xmath40 is threshold constant of supression of @xmath23 mrna transcripted by @xmath23 protein , @xmath41 is michaelis constant for @xmath23 mrna degradation , @xmath42 is michaelis constant for @xmath23 protein degradation in cytoplasm , @xmath43 is michaelis constant for @xmath23 protein degradation in nucleus , @xmath44 is threshold constant for the suppression of delta protein synthesis by @xmath23 protein , @xmath45 is michaelis constant for delta protein degradation in nucleus .",
    "a group of such cells do communicate via delta - notch coupling mechanism when the cells are very close to each other or almost in contact each other .",
    "since delta - proteins are confined only on the cell membrane and can not diffuse from one cell to another , signal is considered to pass from one cell to another by activating the delta - notch signaling pathway when the cells are in contact or very close .",
    "we consider @xmath46 cells which are arranged in a regular three dimensional array in this type of communication , assuming the sizes of the cells are the same as shown in fig .",
    "2 . in this situation",
    ", any cell is allowed to couple with six nearest neighbour cells .",
    "since the coupling variable @xmath22 is common to @xmath46 identical cells , this species can be an effective means of coupling each cell to every other via @xmath47 , where , @xmath48 and summation is restricted to nearest neighbours only for every cells .",
    "the common species provides a `` localized '' mean field like coupling whereby the cells communicate , and the remaining variables synchronize .",
    "[ fig4 ]    , @xmath1 , @xmath2 as a function of time .",
    "the same parameters are used as in fig .",
    "3 . ]    [ fig5 ]        for one and two dimensional array , the allowed number of coupled cells are two and four respectively .",
    "so for the cells in this configuration , the delta - notch signaling activation rate , @xmath32 plays switching on or off of signal processing among the cells and in `` on switch '' condition , coupling in any cell is done via coupling of its nearest neighbour cells . therefore in delta - notch signaling process",
    ", we have the following coupled oscillators , @xmath49 where , @xmath50 , @xmath51 for 1 , 2 , 3 dimensional array of cells and @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 indicate that the pairs @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively are nearest neighbours .",
    "the mode of coupling among the cells is quite similar to mean field coupling scheme @xcite but the way how the coupling is incorporated among the cells in this case is localized within the nearest neighbours only . in this coupling mechanism , once the coupling is switch on with a particular value of @xmath32 , then the cells start synchronized among themselves to exhibit coordinated behaviour . in our simulation",
    "we use fixed boundary conditions in the coupling , i.e. @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ; @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "it has been pointed out that the identification of phase synchrony of any two identical systems can be done qualitatively by the measurement of the time evolution of instantaneous phase difference of the two systems @xcite .",
    "it is possible if one defines an instantaneous phase of an _ arbitrary _ signal @xmath64 via hilbert transform @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the cauchy principal value .",
    "then , one can determine an instantaneous `` phase '' @xmath67 and an instantaneous `` amplitude '' @xmath68 of the given signal through the relation , @xmath69 . given two signals of two systems @xmath70 and @xmath71 , one can therefore obtain instantaneous phases @xmath72 and @xmath73 ; phase synchronization is then the condition that @xmath74 is constant , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are integers .",
    "of most interest are the cases @xmath77 = 0 or @xmath78 , namely the cases of in  phase or anti  phase , but other temporal arrangements may also occur .",
    "the phase synchronization of the two identical systems can also be identified by doing pecora - caroll type recurrence plot of the variable of one system , say @xmath79 with the corresponding variable @xmath80 of the other system simultaneously on two dimensional cartesian co - ordinate system @xcite .",
    "the rate of synchronization between the two systems can be determined by the rate of concentration of the points in the plot along the diagonal .",
    "if the two systems are uncoupled , then the points on the plot will scatter away randomly from the diagonal .",
    "[ fig6 ]        the rate of phase synchrony of the two systems can be estimated quantitatively by measuring the `` phase locking value '' ( plv ) of the two signals of the two systems @xcite .",
    "the phase locking value , which is used to quantify the degree of synchrony , characterizes the stability of phase differences between the phases @xmath72 and @xmath73 of two signals @xmath70 and @xmath71 of ith and jth systems and can be defined within a time period @xmath81 by , @xmath82 the range of plv value is [ 0,1 ] .",
    "when the value of plv is zero , the two systems are uncoupled , whereas if the value of plv is one then the two systems are perfectly phase synchronized @xcite .",
    "we first present one time simulation results of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 of a single cell as a function of time for the values of @xmath3 and 0.7 respectively in fig . 3 by solving differential equations 1,2,3 and 4 by standard 4th order runge kutta numerical integration method @xcite . in the 3d plot , the dynamics shows three different limit cycle oscillations for these three different @xmath32 values . in fig .",
    "4 , the corresponding dynamics of the three variables for two coupling cells are shown in panels ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) indicating phase synchrony irrespective of variation in @xmath32 .",
    "the claim is supported by the phase plots i.e. @xmath83 vs time in fig . 4 ( b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) , along with pecora - caroll type recurrence plots in the panels ( g ) , ( h ) and ( i ) .",
    "it is noticed from the plot that the amplitudes of oscillations of all variables are increased as @xmath32 is increased however the frequencies of oscillations are decreased correspondingly .",
    "the phase locking value for whole time period ( 0 - 1500 ) minutes using equation ( [ plv ] ) is found to be 0.97@xmath840.015 indicating fairly well synchronized .",
    "there are signatures of fluctuations in the beginning of each plot due to the cells evolve in different initial conditions and takes some time to synchronize .",
    "this means that once the coupling is switch on via @xmath32 among the cells , the variation in @xmath32 will hardly effect in the synchrony rate of the cells but will occur at different amplitudes .",
    "next we take @xmath85 such cells arranged in three dimensional array .",
    "we take @xmath86 and apply fixed boundary conditions and simulate differential equations 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and the results of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 as a function of time for 10 cells are shown in fig .",
    "the coupling variable for each cell is @xmath22 via mean field like coupling mechanism restricting to nearest neighbours only and the coupling is switch on at time 300 minutes . in the plots of fig . 5 ( a ) ,",
    "( c ) and ( e ) , three regimes i.e. desynchronized , transition and synchronized regimes are seen clearly .",
    "the phase transition like behaviour is supported by the phase diagrams ( @xmath87 vs time ) of pairs of cells in figures ( b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) where desynchronized regime is indicated by random evolution of @xmath87 with time , transition regime is identified by weak fluctuation of @xmath87 around a constant value and synchronized regime is indicated by constant @xmath87 with time .",
    "again this claim of phase transition is verified qualitatively by pecora - caroll recurrence plots in the upper three panels of fig .",
    "6 . in these plots",
    "if the cells are desynchronized , the points in the plots will spread away from the diagonal , however in the transition regime the points start concentrating towards the diagonal .",
    "when the points lie along the diagonal the cells are synchronized as shown in the plots .    fixing the configuration of cells",
    ", we calculated @xmath87 of pair of far distant cells ( i.e. i=1 , j=10 ) as a function of time , which are already included in the respective diagrams , and found the same pattern of phase transition .",
    "this means that once the coupling is switch on , all the cells process information almost instantaneously even at far distant cells also in the configuration .",
    "hence long range information transfer or relay is done instantaneously when the cells are coupled .    the quantitative identification of this phase transition can be explained more clearly by the measurement of phase locking values ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) of the variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for different time intervals by using the equation ( [ plv ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in the lower three panels of fig .",
    "6 . in these plots , it is seen distinctly the demarcation of the three regimes , desynchronized , transition and synchronized regimes . in the synchronized regime , the values of @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are 0.994@xmath840.002 starting from time interval ( 400 - 500 ) minutes to ( 1100 - 1200 ) minutes . in the time intervals before switching the coupling , the values of @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are in 0.77@xmath840.05 indicating desynchronized regime .",
    "but in the time intervals 300 to 500 minutes , the values of @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 monotonically increased indicating transition regime .",
    "the phase synchrony shown by temporal oscillations of the variables indicates that once the coupling is switched on with the mean field like coupling mechanism with a value of activation rate @xmath32 above some critical value to exhibit synchrony , then the increase of @xmath32 does not affect much in the rate of phase synchrony .",
    "however it affects in the magnitudes of amplitudes and frequencies of oscillations of the dynamical variables of the cells .",
    "it is also to be noted that if the variables evolve with time from different initial conditions , after coupling is switched on , it takes some time to get synchronized .",
    "since the cells coupled only when they are very close or in contact and the delta protein can not diffuse from one cell to another , the mean field like coupling scheme is the most reasonable way of signal processing in this situation .",
    "we take three dimensional array of cells to see the behaviour of phase synchrony in more real situation .",
    "our results interestingly show phase transition like behaviour by identifying desynchronized , transition and synchronized regimes .",
    "relay information transfer among the far cells is done among the cells themselves once the coupling is introduced in a group of cells . to investigate it in more real situation one has to incorporate noise fluctuations arising from internal molecular events and external environmental fluctuations .",
