    "the most important decay modes of superheavy nuclei are mainly @xmath6  decay and spontaneous fission @xcite . among the many theoretical papers in this field",
    "one should mention @xcite and @xcite . for atomic numbers larger than 121 cluster decay @xcite may compete as well @xcite .    in 1928",
    "g. gamow @xcite as well as r.w .",
    "gurney and e.u .",
    "condon @xcite gave the first explanation of @xmath2  decay based on quantum mechanical tunneling of a preformed particle at the nuclear surface .",
    "the microscopic theory had been developed by many scientists , e.g. @xcite .",
    "it was also extended to explain cluster decays @xcite .",
    "simple relationships are also very useful @xcite .    in our paper mentioned in the abstract @xcite we reported results obtained within macroscopic - microscopic method @xcite using cranking inertia @xcite and the best two - center shell model @xcite in the plane of two independent variables @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the separation distance of the fragments and @xmath9 is the mass asymmetry with @xmath10 the mass numbers of the parent and nuclear fragments .",
    "phenomenological deformation energy , @xmath11 , was given by yukawa - plus - exponential model @xcite , and the shell plus pairing corrections , @xmath12 are based on the asymmetric two center shell model ( atcsm ) @xcite .",
    "this time we give more detailed arguments for the neighboring nucleus @xmath3cn . also similar figures are presented for heavy nuclei @xmath4pu and @xmath5cf .",
    "the deep minimum of total deformation energy near the surface is shown for the first time as a strong argument for cluster preformation .",
    "an outline of the model was presented previously @xcite .",
    "we repeat few lines in this section . the parent @xmath13 is split in two fragments : the light , @xmath14 , and the heavy one , @xmath15 with conservation of hadron numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding radii are given by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the separation distance of the fragments is initially @xmath21 and at the touching point @xmath22 with @xmath23  fm .",
    "the geometry for linearly increasing @xmath1 from 0 to @xmath24 is defined by : @xmath25    according to the macroscopic - microscopic method the total deformation energy contains the yukawa - plus - exponential ( y+em ) and the shell plus pairing corrections @xmath26 in units of @xmath27 the shell corrections are calculated with the strutinsky procedure as a sum of protons and neutrons contributions @xmath28 by solving the bcs @xcite system of two equations with two unknowns , we find the fermi energy , @xmath29 , and the pairing gap @xmath30 .",
    "the total pairing corrections are given by @xmath31 and finally the total shell plus pairing corrections in mev @xmath32 the inertia tensor @xcite is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the single - particle hamiltonian allowing to determine the energy levels and the wave functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the bcs occupation probabilities , @xmath38 is the quasiparticle energy , and @xmath39 are the independent shape coordinates . for spherical fragments with @xmath40 deformation parameters the cranking inertia symmetrical tensor will have three components , hence the scalar @xmath41",
    "when we find the least action trajectory in the plane @xmath42 we need to calculate the three components @xmath43 in every point of a grid of 66@xmath4424 ( for graphics ) or 412@xmath4424 ( for the real calculation ) for 66 or 412 values of @xmath45 and 24 values of @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "potential energy surfaces ( pes ) for spontaneous fission of @xmath3cn are shown in figures  [ pescn ] and  [ pescnl ] for constant radius , @xmath1 , of the light fragment and linearly increasing one , respectively .",
    "the corresponding contour plots are given in figures  [ cnc ] and  [ cncl ] , where the first and second minima of deformation energy at every value of mass asymmetry are plotted with dashed and dotted white lines .",
    "more details are given in the two tables  [ tab ] and  [ tabl ] . also , the position and value of maximum y+em model deformation energy versus mass asymmetry , @xmath48 , for fission of @xmath3cn with linearly increasing @xmath1 ( top ) and constant @xmath1 ( bottom ) are shown in figure  [ eym ] .    in figure [ cen ]",
    "we compare the deformation energies with respect to spherical shapes for symmetrical fission of @xmath3cn with @xmath1  constant and linearly increasing @xmath1 ( lin ) .",
    "one can see a relatively law macroscopic energy @xmath49 on which the shell and pairing corrections , @xmath50 deegs a rather deep minimum not far from the nuclear surface .",
    "a completely different `` classical '' two - humped barrier , @xmath51 , may be seen for @xmath52  constant . while the first minima in figure  [ cncl ] and table  [ tabl ] ,",
    "are all lying at @xmath53 , this is true only for 10 mass asymetries out of 23 in figure  [ cnc ] and the table  [ tab ] .",
    "we compare in figure [ shpe2 ] the absolute values of shell and pairing correction energies for symmetrical fission of @xmath3cn with @xmath1  constant ( dashed line ) and linearly increasing @xmath1 ( solid line ) . as expected , the gap for protons , @xmath54 , and neutrons , @xmath55 , solutions of the bcs system of two equations , in figure  [ bcs ] are also following similar variations , while the fermi energies , @xmath56 and @xmath57 have only a shallow minima in the surface region .",
    "deep minima around @xmath58 are clearly seen in both figures .",
    "similar results are also obtained for heavy nuclei like @xmath4pu , figure  [ pu00lc ] and @xmath5cf ( see figure  [ cf00lc ] ) .",
    "see also figures  1 - 3 of the e - print  @xcite .",
    "at the touching point , @xmath59 , both kinds of variations of @xmath60 are ariving at the same state , hence the shell effects are identical there , as may be seen in figures  [ shpe2 ] , [ pu00lc ] and [ cf00lc ] .    the decimal logarithm of the dimensionles @xmath61 component of nuclear inertia tensor for symmetrical fission of @xmath3cn with linearly increasing @xmath1 isplotted in figure  [ lgbr ] . at the touching point and beyond , @xmath62",
    ", one should get the reduced mass : @xmath63 .",
    "the proton contribution are more important than the neutron one .",
    "this figure is completely different from the figure  5 of the ref.@xcite where the components @xmath61 for almost symmetrical fission ( with the light fragment @xmath64pd , @xmath65cd and @xmath66sn ) of @xmath3cn are shown for @xmath67  constant .",
    "values larger than @xmath68 are seen in figure  [ lgbr ] , compared to smaller than @xmath69 for @xmath67  constant .",
    "if we use in graphics @xmath70 instead of @xmath8 then for @xmath0fl the interval of variation will be @xmath71 .",
    "for the initial parent nucleus one may have either @xmath53 or / and @xmath72 .",
    "this is the reason why the dashed line ends up at the value of @xmath73 . in present calculations",
    "we have used 66 values of @xmath74 from @xmath75 to @xmath76 and 24 values of @xmath77 from @xmath75 to @xmath78 .",
    "for minimization of action we need not only @xmath79 but also the values of @xmath80 in every point of a grid of 66@xmath4424 for 66 values of @xmath45 and 24 values of @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "we expect a dynamical path very different from the statical one shown in fig .",
    "[ cncl ] with a white dashed line .",
    "the optimum value of the parameter zero - point vibration energy , @xmath81 , used to reproduce the experimental value of @xmath3cn spontaneous fission half - life , @xmath82 .    in conclusion , with our method of calculating the spontaneous fission half - life including macroscopic - microscopic method for deformation energy based on asymmetric two - center shell model , and the cranking inertia for the dynamical part",
    ", we may find a sequence of several trajectories one of which gives the least action . assuming spherical shapes",
    ", we found that the shape parametrization with linearly increasing @xmath1 is more suitable to describe the fission process of shs in comparison with that of exponentially or linearly decreasing law .",
    "it is in agreement with the microscopic finding concerning the preformation of a cluster at the surface , which then penetrates by quantum tunneling the potential barrier .",
