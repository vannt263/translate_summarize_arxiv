    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) technique exploiting hundreds of antennas at the base station ( bs ) , is one of the key enabler for future 5 g wireless cellular systems . to achieve the theoretical performance gains in massive mimo systems ,",
    "accurate channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) is crucial @xcite . for csit acquisition , frequency - division duplexing ( fdd )",
    "requires direct feedback of the csi from the users to the bs , but such process is unnecessary for time division duplexing ( tdd ) since the csit can be obtained from the uplink channel estimation by leveraging the channel reciprocity @xcite . while many of massive mimo works consider the tdd mode due to this reason , fdd has many benefits over tdd ( especially in delay - sensitive or traffic - symmetric applications @xcite ) and also dominates current cellular networks .",
    "thus , it is of importance to come up with solutions to the csit acquisition problem for fdd massive mimo systems .",
    "conventional csit acquisition for fdd mimo systems consists of two separate steps : channel estimation in the downlink and feedback of csi in the uplink .",
    "first , the bs transmits orthogonal pilots in the downlink , and each user estimates its own channel using the pilot observation . commonly used channel estimation algorithms include least squares ( ls ) and minimum mean square error ( mmse ) .",
    "then , the estimated channel is fed back to the bs via dedicated uplink channels .",
    "since the number of pilots grows with the number of transmit antennas at the bs , overhead of downlink pilot signaling becomes overwhelming for massive mimo systems .",
    "also , the overhead of csi feedback is a serious concern due to the same reason . in order to address these issues ,",
    "various approaches have been proposed in recent years @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "authors propose to reduce the downlink training ovehead by carefully designing the training pilots . in @xcite , an approach to reduce the csi feedback overhead when",
    "the bs antennas are highly correlated has been proposed . in @xcite ,",
    "an approach based on compressive sensing ( cs ) has been proposed to reduce both the downlink training overhead and uplink csi feedback overhead .",
    "while this approach is promising when the channel matrices of different users are sparse and partially share common support , such is not true when these assumptions are violated . in this letter ,",
    "we propose a joint csit acquisition scheme based on low - rank matrix completion for fdd massive mimo systems .",
    "specifically , the bs transmits pilots for downlink channel training and the scheduled users _ directly _ feed back the pilot observation to the bs without performing the individual channel estimation .",
    "then , the joint recovery of the csi for all users is performed at the bs based on the low - rank matrix completion algorithm , whereby the low - rank property of the massive mimo channel matrix caused by correlation among users is exploited . in this way",
    ", the overhead of downlink channel training as well as uplink channel feedback can be reduced , which will be verified by simulation results .",

    "one possible solution to avoid the computional difficulty is to use the nuclear norm minimization problem @xmath64 note that this problem can be solved by semidefinite programming ( sdp ) @xcite , but the computational complexity of the solver ( e.g. , sedumi @xcite ) is still high especially when the problem dimension is large in massive mimo systems . to alleviate the computational complexity",

    "( svp - g ) and svp - based newton s algorithm ( svp - n ) , the solution satisfying the low - rank constraint can be achieved by svp at every iteration . in the @xmath73-th iteration , the current result @xmath74 of linear search",

    "however , as the cost function @xmath97 in ( [ eq10 ] ) is a quadratic convex function of @xmath98 , svp - n simply converges after one iteration ( see appendix a ) .",
    "since the svp operation is performed only once ( i.e. , the low - rank constraint @xmath53 will be used only once ) , the performance of svp - n is generally not appealing . on the other hand ,",
    "svp - g executes svp in every iteration and hence a better solution can be achieved at the cost of slow convergence . to combine the advantages of svp - n and svp - g",
    ", we propose the svp - based hybrid low - rank marix completion algorithm ( svp - h ) as shown in * algorithm 1 * , where svp - n is used in the first iteration ( step 4 ) to realize fast convergence and svp - g is used for the rest iterations ( step 6 ) to achieve high accuracy . during the @xmath73-th iteration , the solution @xmath99 is obtained through a line search along the negative gradient or newton s direction ( step 8) .",

    ", the matrix multiplication to compute the search direction @xmath113 has the complexity @xmath114 , since @xmath115 .",
    "the computation of the step size @xmath116 is complex but we can simply assume a constant step size by allowing marginal decrease in the convergence speed @xcite .",
    "the svp operation @xmath117 requires the complexity @xmath118 .",
    "thus , the complexity of svp - g algorithm is @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the number of iterations . for the svp - n algorithm , since @xmath121 , the matrix multiplication to compute the solution",
    "@xmath99 has the complexity @xmath122 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "there is no need to compute the optimal step size for svp - n since the step size @xmath123 for svp - n is a constant ( @xmath124 ) as shown in appendix a. thus , the complexity of svp - n is @xmath125 . finally , we can conclude that the proposed svp - h algorithm has the complexity @xmath126 , which is much lower than that of existing sdp algorithms .",

    "[ svp_itr ] , we compare the normalized mean squared error ( nmse ) performance of the conventional csit acquisition scheme and the proposed joint csit acquisition scheme .",
    "note that the nmse of the joint orthogonal matching pursuit ( j - omp ) algorithm based compressive csit estimation and feedback scheme proposed in @xcite is also presented for comparison .",
    "the uplink channel is assumed to suffer from rayleigh fading @xcite , and both the downlink and uplink signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) are set to 25 db . as a conventional channel estimation scheme at the user side , we use the widely used ls algorithm .",
    "in addition , the proposed joint csit acquisition using conventional svp - n , svp - g algorithms and the proposed svp - h algorithm for joint mimo channel recovery at the bs side are also compared in fig .",
    "[ svp_itr ] . due to the utilization of correlations among users and the resulting low - rank property of mimo channel matrix ,",
    "it is clear that the proposed schemes using svp - g , svp - n , and svp - h outperform the conventional one using ls .",
    "the nmse performance of j - omp is not good because the angular - domain channel matrix in our system model does not satisfy the sparse channel assumption , and the imperfect uplink channel degrades the performance of j - omp .",
    "we also observe that both svp - h and svp - g achieve much smaller nmse than svp - n achieves because they repeatedly exploit the low - rank constraint as mentioned in section iii - b .",
    "in addition , svp - h converges faster than svp - g due to the utilization of fast convergent svp - n in the first iteration .",
    "that is to say , the proposed svp - h algorithm achieves accurate csit and fast convergence .",
    "[ svp_n_c_t ]    we next investigate the overhead reduction of the proposed joint csit acquisition scheme against the channel use @xmath22 . note that the nmse performance of sdp - based method and rp algorithm have also been shown in fig .",
    "[ svp_n_c_t ] for comparison .",
    "we can observe that both approaches perform similar to the proposed svp - h algorithm .",
    "we can also observe that the channel use required for the proposed scheme using svp - h is much smaller than that required for the conventional scheme .",
    "for example , to achieve the targeted nmse @xmath134 , the channel use required for the conventional scheme is @xmath135 , while that required for the proposed scheme is @xmath136 .",
    "this clearly indicates that the proposed scheme can reduce the overhead of downlink channel training and uplink channel feedback .",
    "in this letter , we investigate a novel csit acquisition scheme for fdd massive mimo systems by exploiting the property that the channel matrix of massive mimo system has low - rank structure . using this property",
    ", we formulate the joint csit acquisition scheme as a low - rank matrix completion problem .",
    "simulations have verified that the proposed svp - h algorithm can achieve accurate csit with fast convergence .",
    "by substituting @xmath137 into ( [ eq14 ] ) , we can compute the step size of svp - n @xmath138 the solution in the @xmath73-th iteration is given by @xmath139 which is a constant vector and independent of the iteration index @xmath73 .",
