    "the melting process of metals , semiconductors , alloys and nanocrystals is investigated for its intrinsic importance and to understand thermodynamics of phase transitions , condensed matter structures , planets geophysical structure , geology , astrophysics , dynamics of solar planets and inner earth core .",
    "+ well known are the semi - empirical rules introduced by sutherland @xcite and lindemann @xcite and their amendments @xcite , validated by the application to melting of the atomic einstein - mott model to evaluate , at melting temperature , atomic vibration amplitude relative to atomic spacing .",
    "melting takes place when the atomic oscillation amplitude is larger than the interatomic distance , the change in the nature of the vibration spectrum is the only reason for melting @xcite .",
    "after quick progress in early times , when many authors understood the mechanism of metal melting @xcite , more recently the process was described by regel and glazov @xcite , among others .",
    "they showed that the vibrational entropy change is the main contribution to metal melting entropy , while for semiconductors the electronic structure change from solid to liquid is also a leading contribution .",
    "wallace @xcite described the melting process introducing all the effective liquid correlation terms and observed that metals can be divided into two groups : normal when the electronic ground state between solid and liquid phases does not change , anomalous when the electronic ground state changes and the liquid higher order correlation contributions are not negligible .",
    "+ the metal melting entropy can be given in a simple form as the logarithm of solid and liquid frequencies related to the einstein - mott vibration atomic model , allowing to link melting entropy and electrical conductivity .",
    "other models have been developed in @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies to understand how the gradual process of melting evolves , a problem studied also by feynmann as reported by dash @xcite , consolidate the microscopic formulation of the melting entropy as a logarithmic function .    in the solid - liquid transition",
    "the order due to atomic localization in the solid phase is lost . at melting",
    ", the solid phase is metastable and , in the liquid , disordered phase correlations are active .",
    "therefore , models of melting entropy require the calculation of many different contributions .",
    "in these frames , our thought is that metal melting entropy more conveniently can be described by means of the generalized non - extensive ( next ) statistical mechanics as developed in recent years by @xcite and by others authors @xcite . in their approaches ,",
    "an entropic parameter takes into account the presence of correlations in quasi - stationary or metastable systems .",
    "this parameter can make the difference among different values of metal melting entropy .",
    "+ after the calculation of the solid and liquid next entropy @xmath1 through the respective grand partition functions using the approaches of @xcite , we have evaluated the melting quantum entropy of metals , modified with the recipes of the next statistical mechanics , as a function of the solid and liquid atomic frequencies derived from the measured conductivity @xcite .",
    "it is significant , for the validity of next statistical mechanics in quasi - stationary states with correlations , to verify that a good agreement with experimental results of melting entropy can be reached by the simple next modified mott relation , avoiding calculation of correlation contributions .",
    "+ let us outline the aims of this work .",
    "in the melting of a metal ( and vice versa in freezing ) we have a quantum localized system , described by a localized distribution , that , at melting temperature , becomes delocalized and is described by a quantum boltzmann distribution @xcite . during melting , a solid system ( crystal ) , with almost no correlation in a metastable state , is transformed to a system ( liquid ) with many local correlations ( vice versa during freezing ) .",
    "+ at melting , the two states ( quantum localized and quantum boltzmann ) coexist with the same entropic parameter @xmath0 , at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "we can consider that temperature could fluctuate around its average value .",
    "in fact , the liquid system has a different volume than the solid phase .",
    "variation of volume from the metastable solid state to liquid is connected with particle correlations i.e. with density fluctuation and then with temperature fluctuation .",
    "furthermore , particle correlations are responsible of density fluctuations and therefore of temperature fluctuations that gives rise to non - extensivity . in this sense ,",
    "particle correlations are equivalent to temperature fluctuations .",
    "in fact , as shown in @xcite the parameter @xmath3 is strictly related to particle correlations according to @xmath4 that arises in the study of thermonuclear reactions in the solar core plasma , where @xmath5 is the plasma parameter and @xmath6 a nucleon - nucleon correlation parameter . therefore , the consequence is that the non - extensive treatment is fully justified @xcite .",
    "+ after comparing the next evaluation of metal melting entropy with the experimental results we can analyze the behavior of the different metals with respect to the entropic parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we show that metals can be grouped in two families with two different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the entropic parameter makes a difference between correlations present in normal and anomalous metals .",
    "the possible division of metallic elements into two groups was already indicated in @xcite .    by considering that :",
    "i ) during the transition from the solid phase to the liquid one the metal goes from an ordered , localized solid to a disordered liquid system ; ii ) the process is cooperative and in the liquid there are many - body correlations and also memory effects in intermediate state seem to appear ; iii ) melting is a first order transition that is not exactly at equilibrium , or at a thermodynamic global equilibrium , but rather at a meta - equilibrium or quasi - stationary state ; iv ) the melting entropy is related to the logarithmic function of the grand canonical potential , it is natural to advance the hypothesis that metal entropy could more conveniently be described as a @xmath3-logarithmic function ( @xmath7 ) of the grand canonical potential within the frame of next statistical mechanics whose use in this context we want to justify and validate .",
    "+ finally , we remark that boltzmann entropy does not take into account particle correlations while deformed entropy does through the deformation entropic parameter and shows as this parameter can distinguish between normal and anomalous metals .",
    "+ let us conclude this paragraph by summarizing the content of this work . we first introduce the classical mott relation",
    ", then we derive melting quantum entropy by means of quantum partition functions of localized and quantum boltzmann distributions .",
    "then we present the next modified mott relation .",
    "we discuss the calculated and the observed results and give our interpretation of them . because the correction to mott melting entropy depends on the average number @xmath8 of atoms of the ensemble we report in a figure the dependence of metal melting entropy at given @xmath0 on @xmath8 .",
    "finally , we conclude recalling the importance of metal melting also in planet cores and in some astrophysical objects as well as in nanostructures , semiconductors and superconductors . +",
    "in standard statistical mechanics , based on boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) approach ( extensive thermodynamics ) , melting proceeds at constant @xmath2 and can be studied simply in the grand canonical formalism by equalling solid and liquid gibbs free energy .",
    "we start by introducing the extensive entropy according to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of possible configurations occurring with probability @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "+ sometime , especially in chemistry texts , eq .",
    "( [ sbg ] ) is named configurational or positional entropy . in the microcanonical picture where all different configurations are realized with the same probability @xmath13 , eq .",
    "( [ sbg ] ) measures the number of possible configurations of the system : @xmath14 .",
    "differently , thermodynamic entropy is defined through the relation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the infinitesimal heat exchanged by the system with its environment at temperature @xmath17 .",
    "however , it is strongly believed that configurational entropy and thermodynamical entropy should represent ultimately the same physical quantity in spite of their different expression @xcite . + differently , in the non - extensive formalism , the equivalence between the configurational entropy and thermodynamical entropy is still an open question .",
    "notwithstanding , under the condition of _ no work _",
    ", a situation encountered in the study of melting , the fundamental thermodynamical relation of @xmath18 holds also in the non - extensive picture , justifying reasonably the equivalence between the configurational and thermodynamical entropy also in the next formalism .",
    "consequently , in the following we assume that vibrational entropy equal to the measured thermal entropy .",
    "+ in the grand canonical picture , equilibrium distribution is obtainable by maximizing entropy ( [ sbg ] ) for a fixed value of the mean energy @xmath19 and the mean particle numbers @xmath8 .",
    "it turns out to be @xmath20 for a given energy level @xmath21 and particles number @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the chemical potential .",
    "+ in this way , bg entropy at equilibrium assumes the expression @xmath24 whereas @xmath25 and @xmath26 are related to the partition function by @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the fugacity .    to study melting ,",
    "two different grand canonical partition functions are used to describe the solid and liquid phases .",
    "they are given by @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 for the solid and liquid phases , respectively , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the corresponding partition functions of single particle .",
    "+ the solid phase , can be depicted by the einstein model for a mono - atomic metal with atoms , like harmonic oscillators , localized in the @xmath8 nodal positions of the lattice crystal . in this situation",
    "the single particle canonical distribution reads @xmath34 and describes the statistics of a quantum oscillator in the limit of high temperature with @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the vibration frequency of molecules , @xmath37 is the fundamental energy of each oscillator and @xmath38 the planck constant .",
    "+ differently , in the liquid phase each atom is non - localized and can occupy any of the @xmath8 nodal position so that the related distribution function is @xmath39 , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 being the corresponding quantities for the liquid phase .    under the condition of no external work ,",
    "the melting heat is given by the difference of internal energy of liquid and solid at the melting temperature @xmath2 @xmath42 we can evaluate the difference of the fundamental energy levels @xmath43 of the liquid and solid phases by introducing the free energy @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , by recalling that , at equilibrium of the two phases , chemical potentials must coincide , one obtains @xmath45 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",
    "+ as a consequence , the melting entropy per particle @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the gas constant .",
    "+ the melting entropy is thermally measured while frequency ratios can be obtained from electrical conductivity @xmath50 according to @xmath51 .",
    "comparison with the observed data does not meet a wide agreement since observed @xmath52 are quite different from @xmath52 obtained using the definition above and the observed melting entropy .",
    "better agreement can be found by means of the semi - empirical , amended , lindemann rule @xcite .",
    "nonextensive statistical mechanics is a generalization of statistical mechanics for the study of anomalous systems , typically plagued by long range interactions and time persistent memory effects , whose statistical behavior may differ in a significant way from the predictions made by the orthodox theory based on the bg entropy . in next a power - law distribution",
    "is expected instead of the exponential one that is obtained by maximizing the associated nonextensive entropy . among the different entropic forms proposed in literature @xcite , tsallis entropy @xcite in the @xmath53-formalism @xcite",
    "is defined by replacing the standard logarithm in the bg entropy ( [ sbg ] ) with its deformed version , the @xmath3-logarithm @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the entropic parameter that takes into account the correlations present into the system .",
    "consequently , the generalized entropy assumes the form @xmath56 equation ( [ s2q ] ) reduces to the bg - entropy in the @xmath57 limit : @xmath58 , as well as , in the same limit @xmath59 .",
    "+ in this way , equilibrium distribution , obtained by maximizing entropy ( [ s2q ] ) under fixed mean energy and total number of particles , assumes the following form @xmath60 where the @xmath3-exponential @xmath61^{1\\over1-q } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the inverse function of the @xmath3-logarithm : @xmath62 .",
    "( [ qdis ] ) @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a @xmath3-dependent constant and @xmath65 is the @xmath3-deformed grand partition function .",
    "following next approach , in the solid phase , away from the melting temperature , correlations can be neglected so that @xmath66 . on the other hand correlations",
    "play a role in the liquid phase with @xmath67 .",
    "consequently , the crystal energy levels are those of the harmonic oscillator while the levels of the liquid phases are not rendered explicit . at melting temperature , because the melting state is a new ensemble , we expect @xmath0 .",
    "the region of validity of the next model is @xmath68 .",
    "+ therefore , for the solid phase , we postulate the same expression of @xmath32 as in the extensive theory , while for the liquid phase we make the ansatz @xmath69 where correlations are accounted for by the entropic parameter .",
    "+ at equilibrium , the non extensive entropy becomes ( we refer to the appendix for technical details ) @xmath70 \\ , \\label{sq}\\ ] ] and consistently we have @xmath71 while the melting heat takes the same expression ( [ u ] ) obtained in the extensive case .",

    "we remark that the nonextensive entropy melting per particles @xmath87 depends , through the term @xmath82 , on the number of particles @xmath8 of the system .",
    "we discuss the importance of this fact in the next paragraph .",
    "+ in the @xmath57 limit the corrective term vanishes for all @xmath8 , @xmath88 , so that @xmath89 .",

    "all values of @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath2 are the measured values collected by wallace @xcite from many different experimental works quoted in his papers , and by others @xcite .",
    "we recall that si and ge are semiconductors when solid , and metals when liquid .",
    "sb and bi are semimetals in the solid state and metals in the liquid state .",
    "finally , ga forms metal when solid , becomes metal when liquid but with anomalous and almost unknown change in the electric ground state from solid to liquid .",
    "+ experimental results on @xmath92 ( or @xmath94 ) and @xmath93 come from thermal and electric conductivity measurements , respectively @xcite .",
    "+ in the normal metals , melting entropy is composed by a contribution of the lattice dynamics and one due mainly to liquid correlations . in the anomalous metals (",
    "si , ga , ge , sb , bi ) melting entropy is much greater than normal : change in the electronic energy is due to a change of electronic ground state upon melting .",
    "+ wallace @xcite has given an expression of metal melting entropy which reads    @xmath95    where @xmath96 and @xmath97 indicate the liquid and solid entropy , respectively , index @xmath98 means one - body contribution , @xmath99 correlation contribute , @xmath100 the solid harmonic term , @xmath101 the anharmonic , @xmath102 quantum and @xmath103 electronic contribution , obtaining agreement within experimental errors .",
    "+    we may see that @xmath104 can be related to the classical melting entropy @xmath105 . in the normal metals",
    "the contribution from @xmath102 and @xmath103 terms is nearly negligible , while the @xmath106 and @xmath107 quantities are very important and the value of @xmath0 strictly depends on them . + the use of next statistical mechanics avoids the calculation of correlation and other different contributions .",
    "the values of @xmath0 we obtain setting eq .",
    "( [ sqq ] ) equal to the observed @xmath92 are those reported in table i and ii and clearly depicted in fig .",
    "1 , where we report for 13 normal metals and 5 anomalous metals the value of @xmath0 given in table i and ii .",
    "+ from experimental data we see that metals can be separated in two classes respect the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "all normal metals show a value of the entropic parameter @xmath0 between @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( mean value @xmath110 ) while anomalous metals between @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( mean value @xmath113 ) .",
    "although the difference of the values of @xmath0 for normal metals and anomalous metals is only of few percent it is decisive enough to recover the observed normal metal melting entropies ( average value @xmath114 ) that sensibly differ from the observed anomalous metal melting entropies ( average value @xmath115 ) .",
    "in fact , as it happens in other situations , very small differences of @xmath3 can produce large differences in physical observables ( for instance , in the rates of thermonuclear reactions ) .",
    "+ however , in our opinion , the discrepancy in the value of @xmath0 between normal and anomalous metals arise from the different correlations present inside the two systems .",
    "+ the sensitivity of @xmath87 from the @xmath3 parameter is better clarified in fig . 2 where we show the dependence of @xmath82 from @xmath3 for several values of @xmath8 .",
    "as @xmath8 increases the sensibility of @xmath82 reduces .",
    "for instance , at @xmath116 the variation of @xmath82 in the range of @xmath117 ( twenty orders ! ) is about @xmath118 while for @xmath119 ( increasing of only three orders of magnitude ) the variation of @xmath82 is about @xmath120 .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamical limit of large @xmath8 melting entropy for particle is almost independent from @xmath8 and we expect that entropy scales as @xmath121",
    ". therefore , in this limit , entropy per particles ( [ sqq ] ) does not depend by @xmath8 , i.e. melting entropy is an extensive quantity only for @xmath122 .",
    "we remark that , although @xmath82 is a continuous function , its slope , for @xmath57 , is almost vertical , so that @xmath123 in the same limit . +    in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath87 , for four crystal over liquid frequencies , is plotted versus @xmath8 for two values of @xmath0 . in the log - log scale of the two insets we can see that next melting entropies @xmath87 behave , in first approximation , like parallel straight lines , indicating that @xmath87 can also be expressed as a power law function of @xmath8 according to @xmath124 with @xmath125 for large @xmath8 .    in fig . 4 , @xmath87 is plotted versus @xmath3 for few values of @xmath93 and for several values of @xmath8 .",
    "it is shown that the difference among the curves , in the region between @xmath126 and @xmath127 , decreases as @xmath8 increases .",
    "for @xmath128 we have @xmath129 .    from fig .",
    "4 we can see that once @xmath8 and @xmath93 are fixed , a value of @xmath130 smaller than 2 exists such that , for @xmath131 , the melting entropy @xmath87 becomes negative . therefore , we limit ourselves to consider the next metal melting model valid in the range @xmath132 .",
    "+ finally , let us remark that , because the gap between the two average values of @xmath3 ( for metals and non - metals ) increases as the number of particles @xmath8 diminishes , the approach described in this work is particularly suitable for the melting of nanosystems .",
    "in this work , we have reconsidered the mott relation of melting entropy .",
    "we have modified and generalized it by taking into account that in metal melting the system transfers from a localized , metastable state with no correlation to a non - localized , highly correlated liquid state .",
    "therefore , the use of generalized next statistics is justified and appropriate for a precise description of the metal melting entropy .",
    "the division of the metals into two groups , as already indicated in the past by regel and glazov and by wallace , with two different values of the parameter @xmath3 has been recovered , indicating that @xmath3 could be used as a discriminator parameter between normal and anomalous metals .",
    "of course , the values of the experimental quantity @xmath92 discriminate metals from nonmetals too .",
    "hoverer , @xmath92 and @xmath3 are two distinct quantities ( the former experimental and the latter theoretical ) with distinct roles . by knowing `` a priori '' the values of @xmath3 for metals and for nonmetals",
    ", one could give the appropriate value of @xmath3 to any element before measuring @xmath92 .",
    "we have found @xmath3 `` a posteriori '' from experimental data of several elements so that any other element belonging to one of the two categories must have a @xmath3 value belonging to the corresponding class . in this way , the theoretical value of melting entropy arising from eq .",
    "( 19 ) gives us @xmath92 .",
    "+ the physical meaning of the entropic parameter @xmath3 can be understood from the microscopic description of the wallace works @xcite in terms of the two - body correlation function .",
    "depending on the two values of @xmath3 other metals , whose melting entropy is not reported here , belong to one of the two classes .",
    "+ melting of metals is still today widely studied to understand properties of melting in condensed matter , semiconductors , superconductors , nanostructure and also for its importance in planetary and stellar physics .",
    "calculations of melting ( and freezing ) entropy of light elements ( h , he ) and medium - heavy ( fe , si , mg ) elements in the sun , jupiter and saturn are useful for the knowledge of the dynamics of their inner cores @xcite .",
    "furthermore , concerning the inner core of the earth @xcite , it has been recently observed that in the sub - mantle there is simultaneously melting and freezing because of circulation of heat in the overlying rocky mantle with implications in the terrestrial magnetic field and seismology .",
