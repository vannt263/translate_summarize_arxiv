    "recent experiments on neutrino oscillations ( for a review see e.g.  @xcite ) determine non - zero difference of masses of various species of neutrinos . the experiments on atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite are explained via @xmath0 oscillations with mass difference @xmath1\\cdot 10^{-3}\\:\\mathrm{ev}^2 $ ] , while experiments  @xcite determine mass squared difference @xmath2\\cdot 10^{-5}\\:\\mathrm{ev}^2 $ ] for @xmath3 transitions .",
    "probably , a simplest way to consistently explain these data is to add to the standard model several ( at least two ) gauge singlet fermions - right handed , or sterile neutrinos .",
    "however , the absolute values of masses of active and sterile neutrinos are not fixed by these experiments .",
    "it was noticed long time ago ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) that a sterile neutrino with the mass in the kev range appears to be a viable `` warm '' dm candidate . if such a neutrino is a main ingredient of the dm , it is potentially detectable in various x - ray observations . to wit , there exists a ( sub - dominant ) radiative decay channel of sterile neutrino @xmath4 into active neutrinos @xmath5 and photon with energy @xmath6 , with the width  @xcite @xmath7 ^ 5\\;\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\:.\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is the mixing angle defined as @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the dirac mass and @xmath11 is the sterile neutrino mass .",
    "although even for the main decay channel ( @xmath12 ) the lifetime of sterile neutrino must exceed the age of the universe , the decay @xmath13 can result in a potentially detectable x - ray flux @xcite , since the density of dm in the universe is large .",
    "for example , the contribution to the diffuse x - ray background ( xrb ) can be comparable with measured xrb and is given by ( see  @xcite and references therein ) @xmath14 ^ 5\\frac{\\mbox{erg}}{\\mathrm{cm^2\\cdot s\\cdot        sr}}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 are the dark matter density in the universe and the hubble constant .",
    "neutrinos decaying at different red shifts produce a broad x - ray line with extended `` red '' tail .",
    "such a feature in the xrb spectrum is , in principle , readily detectable ( and distinguishable ) from the broad - band continuum of observed xrb  @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of the dm decay feature in the xrb signal enables to put a bound on @xmath8 and @xmath11 roughly at the level of  @xcite @xmath16^{5}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the present day density of sterile neutrino , understood as dm candidates .",
    "clustering of the dm at small red shifts results in the enhancement of the dm decay signal in the direction of large mass concentrations , such as galaxy clusters . taking into account the typical overdensity @xmath18 of a galaxy cluster is at the level of @xmath19 , while typical cluster size is about @xmath20  mpc  @xmath21 , one can find that the dm decay flux from a galaxy cluster , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the mass of dm within telescope s field of view ( fov ) and @xmath24 are the luminosity and angular diameter distances to the cluster ) is comparable to the background dm decay signal @xmath25although the total dm decay flux from the xrb and from the cluster are of the same order , their spectra are different .",
    "the flux from the cluster would be detected as a narrow line whose width @xmath26 is determined by the spectral resolution of an x - ray detector . at the same time , the dm decay contribution into xrb is produced by the decays at red shifts @xmath27 and , as a result the dm decay line is broadened to @xmath28 .",
    "thus , in spite of the fact that the compact dm sources at @xmath29 give just moderate enhancement of the dm decay flux , the enhancement of the signal in the narrow energy band centered on the line energy @xmath6 could be large . from the energy dependence of @xmath30 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) one can estimate that the enhancement can be by a factor of @xmath31 for instruments of spectral resolution of chandra or xmm ( in this paper we will use xmm observations of virgo and coma clusters ) .    however , the detection of the dm decay line in the galaxy clusters is complicated by the fact that most of the galaxy clusters show strong continuum and line emission from the hot intracluster gas",
    ". the typical temperatures of the intraculser gas , @xmath32\\left[\\frac{d}{1\\mbox {        mpc}}\\right]^2\\mbox { kev}\\;,\\ ] ] lie exactly the range of _ chandra _ or xmm - newton satellites  1 - 10 kev .",
    "in fact , for a typical nearby x - ray bright cluster , the diffuse continuum emission from the cluster core is by a factor @xmath33 stronger than the xrb emission from behind the core .",
    "thus , the factor @xmath34 increase of the flux in the dm decay line from the cluster direction is `` washed out '' by the strong increase of the x - ray continuum emission from the direction of a cluster .",
    "we will see however than in spite of such a strong background , the bound on @xmath35 can be improved by a factor of about 24 in comparison with xrb  ( [ xrbbound ] ) .",
    "previously this question was addressed in the paper by @xcite . there",
    "the authors claimed the following limit on the neutrino mass and mixing angle , derived from the non - observation of the dm decay line from the center of the virgo galaxy cluster : @xmath36 for @xmath37  kev .",
    "this limit is several times better than eq .",
    "( [ xrbbound ] ) .",
    "in this paper we re - analyze the bounds on the sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle imposed by the observations of coma and virgo galaxy clusters . as we will discuss in section  [ sec : results ] , our constraints are weaker than those claimed by  @xcite .",
    "we will compare in details these two results in section  [ sec : concl ] and explain the origin of the difference .    in this work",
    "we show that the problem of the large continuum x - ray emission from the cluster core can be partially relaxed , if one searches for the dm decay signal from a region outside the bright x - ray core of the cluster .",
    "the reason for that is the following : outside the core of the cluster , the surface brightness profile of intracluster medium ( icm ) behaves as @xmath38 ( where , e.g. for virgo cluster @xmath39  @xcite ) , while the surface brightness profile of the dm is more shallow @xmath40  ( see e.g.  @xcite , for mass density of virgo cluster ) .",
    "therefore , by moving away from the center , one can put much tighter constraints on the dm parameters . for the case of coma cluster observations with xmm one",
    "needs to use periphery observations ( `` coma mosaic '' observations , performed in may - june 2000 , @xcite ) . for the case of virgo",
    "this goal can be achieved already for the xmm observation of m87 ( observation i d 0114120101 ) indeed , as the core radius of virgo cluster is very small ( @xmath41 ) , the existing observations with xmm epn camera ( field - of - view @xmath42 ) allows one to study properties of virgo cluster till about @xmath43 .",
    "we also show that the bound can be further improved if the x - ray spectra of galaxy clusters are analyzed by the method proposed by @xcite for the search of the dm decay line in the xrb spectrum .",
    "we describe the analysis of the data from coma and virgo observations in section  [ sec : analysis ] and present results in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the main obstacle for improving the bound on the neutrino parameters from the x - ray background by using galaxy clusters observations is strong x - ray continuum and line emission from the cluster core . in this section",
    "we show that this obstacle could be partially avoided if one extracts the x - ray spectrum from the regions beyond the core of the continuum x - ray emission .",
    "the idea is that the radial surface brightness profile of the continuum emission is normally steeper than the radial surface brightness profile expected from the dm decay line .",
    "indeed , the surface brightness profile of a relaxed cluster of galaxies is usually well - fitted by the so - called isothermal @xmath44-model  @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the _ projected _ distance from the center of the cluster , @xmath47 is the overall normalization factor and @xmath48 is the `` core radius '' of the region of x - ray emission .",
    "parameters @xmath49 , @xmath48 and @xmath44 are different for different clusters ( see section  [ sec : analysis ] below ) .",
    "the volume emissivity of the intracluster gas which results in the surface brightness profile ( [ eq:1 ] ) is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the ( 3d ) distance to the center of the cluster .",
    "the continuum x - ray emission from the intracluster gas is the thermal bremsstrahlung for which the volume emissivity is proportional to the square of the gas density .",
    "the radial density profile of the hot intracluster gas is therefore @xmath52 to calculate the radial mass profile @xmath53 ( gas plus galaxies plus the dm ) of the cluster one has to make an assumption that the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "one can really expect this assumption to hold only for relaxed galaxy clusters , but as it turns out even for e.g. virgo this model gives good predictions ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . under this assumption the overall mass profile can be calculated from the newton s law @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the radial temperature profile of the hot intracluster gas . in the region where the temperature does not change significantly",
    ", one can calculate the overall mass profile analytically by substituting  ( [ eq:3 ] ) into  ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium them immediately leads to the following total mass dependence on the distance @xmath51 from the center of the cluster  @xcite @xmath56 the overall density profile is given by @xmath57 in the first approximation one can estimate the dm density as @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "the surface brightness profile  ( [ eq:1 ] ) should be compared with the surface brightness of the dm .",
    "integrating the volume emissivity of the dm decay line over the line of sight one can find the brightness profile of the dm decay line @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the column density of the dm as a function of the distance from the cluster center .",
    "substituting @xmath62 from ( [ eq:6 ] ) one obtains @xmath63 ~.\\ ] ] integrating @xmath64  ( [ eq:8 ] ) from @xmath65 to some @xmath46 one finds the flux of dm from a fov circle with the projected radius  @xmath46 : @xmath66 where we have defined a _ geometry factor _ @xmath67 , describing that part of the cluster , which we are using for the measurement . in case of the circular region with the projected radius @xmath46 one gets from  ( [ eq:8 ] ) : @xmath68 one can see that @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the radial profile of dm decay line is significantly more shallow than the profile of the continuum x - ray emission from the hot intracluster gas : @xmath71\\left [ 1+\\frac{r^2}{r_0 ^ 2}\\right]^{3\\beta-2}\\hskip -2ex   \\sim \\left(\\frac{r}{r_0}\\right)^{6\\beta-2}\\hskip -2ex ,",
    "\\,r\\gg r_0 ~.\\ ] ] as it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , @xmath72 , therefore , the share of dm contribution to the total brightness ( at energy @xmath6 ) increases as one moves away from the center of a cluster .",
    "in this work we have chosen to analyze data of xmm - newton observations of virgo galaxy cluster ( observation i d 0114120101 , june 2000 ) and coma cluster .",
    "for the latter we have taken two observations which constituted the part of the so called _ coma mosaic _",
    "@xcite : that of the center of coma cluster ( observation i d 0124711401 , may 2000 ) and one of the peripheral observations ( `` coma 3 '' , i d 0124710301 , june 2000 ) .      first , we find the restrictions on the parameters of sterile neutrino , based on the total emission from the icm .",
    "namely , using the xmm observation data and estimating a mass of dm in the center of a cluster as in section  [ sec : theory ] , we restrict parameters @xmath11 and @xmath73 by demanding that the flux of dm decay line  ( [ eq:10 ] ) did not exceed the total flux in the energy bin , equal to the @xmath74 where with of the gaussian line @xmath75 is equal to the spectral resolution of xmm .",
    "we will often dub this method simply _ total flux restrictions_. this method provides the most robust exclusion .      to find the typical numerical values of the dm decay flux as compared to the thermal bremsstrahlung flux ,",

    "namely , we use the fact that the spectral shape of the dm decay line may differ significantly from that of the icm continuum and therefore adding a line which is `` too strong '' ( e.g. with the flux equal to that of the continuum ) will simply contradict observations . in general , typical x - ray spectrum of a galaxy cluster is dominated by the bremsstrahlung continuum and line emission from the hot intracluster gas . to obtain a good fit of observed data to physical model",
    "( such as e.g. mekal  @xcite or raymond - smith  @xcite ) , one needs to take into account that their parameters ( e.g. temperature and abundances ) vary with radius and even with azimuthal angle ; that the icm plasma is often described by multi - component models ; etc .",

    "knowledge of physics ( the correct choice of model ) allows to relate various parameters of the model ( such as positions and intensities of the lines , abundances , etc . ) to each other , however , the structure of the model remains the same : continuum emission plus lines .",
    "therefore , we introduce a phenomenological model for the cluster spectrum which provides a good fit to the x - ray data , but at the same time has a limited number of parameters so that one can easily constrain the maximal possible contribution of the dm decay line into the x - ray emission from the cluster .",
    "the restriction is much stronger in those regions of the spectrum , where one has no lines  the non - detection of the decay line against monotonic continuum , essentially puts the restriction on the flux of the line comparable to the error of the continuum flux . at the regions , where emissions lines are present , the restriction of statistical analysis is much weaker and the flux of dm decay is essentially equal to the excess flux above the continuum .",

    "these models provide a satisfactory fit to the observed x - ray spectra of coma and virgo clusters .",
    "obviously , addition of a strong line feature with the integrated line flux equal to the model flux within a given energy bin would destroy the fit to the data .",
    "moreover , it would provide a non - satisfactory fit already at much smaller dm line flux , of the order of the statistical error of the data in the narrow energy bin .    in order to quantify the above qualitative observation we use the following algorithm to find the maximal possible contribution of the dm decay line at a given energy :    1 .",

    "[ fig : result ] .",
    "3 .   by analyzing the form of the spectrum",
    ", one can refine the restrictions on parameters of sterile neutrino ( as discussed in details in section  [ sec : chi2 ] ) .",
    "from all the data used in this work , the best result was obtained in analysis of the coma center region ( see section  [ sec : chi2-coma ] and appendix  [ sec : model - coma ] ) .",

    "it provides an improvement by a factor 24 over the xrb result of @xcite in the region @xmath144 .",
    "one can qualitatively understand why coma center observations gives the best result for statistical analysis . as discussed in the section  [ sec : chi2-coma ] , the more monotonic is the data , the better the method of statistical analysis works .",
    "the result significantly improves over the total flux restriction only in the regions where `` there are no lines '' . due to the fact that coma temperature is 4 times bigger than that of virgo , the phenomenological model for the coma cluster requires only three additional lines ( as discussed in details in appendix  [ sec : model - coma ] ) .    .",
    "the blue dashed curve represents the result of statistical analysis of the coma center .",
    "the straight magenta line represents the xrb restrictions from  @xcite .",
    "in this work we analyzed the restrictions on the parameters of the sterile neutrino , as a dark matter candidate , coming from the observations of several clusters of galaxies .",
    "below we compare our results with those of other authors and discuss what improvements on restriction plots one expects to obtain from galaxy clusters data .    1 .",
    "we see that this work brings improvement by a factor 24 ( in the region @xmath145 ) over the previous analysis of  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ) . this should be compared with the results of  @xcite , where stronger constraints , derived from the restriction of the total flux of the virgo cluster , were claimed .",
    "below , we explain the reason for this difference .",
    "+ assuming @xmath146 , @xcite argued that if the sterile neutrino mass would be @xmath147  kev , the `` enormous '' dm decay line observed in the core of virgo galaxy cluster ( or , more precisely from its cd galaxy m87 ) would dominate over the continuum flux . to illustrate this ,  @xcite modeled ( via webspec interface ) the emission of the m87 by mekal model with the temperature @xmath148  kev and overall normalization of the flux in the 2 - 10  kev interval equal to @xmath149erg/(@xmath90 ) , the number taken from  @xcite .",
    "this value for the emission flux from the center of virgo is , however , two orders of magnitude _ below _ the actual flux , as one can see from the literature  @xcite or by comparing these numbers with the actual experimental data ( e.g. observation of m87 with xmm in 2001 ( obs .",
    "i d 0114120101 ) . from the latter one",
    "can measure that the flux in the range 2 - 10  kev is some two orders of magnitude higher ( @xmath150  erg/@xmath90 ) .",
    "while the discussed in the paper of  @xcite flux of dm is taken from the whole fov of chandra ( which has an area @xmath151 ) , the number @xmath149  erg/@xmath90 in the @xcite refers to the emission from the active nucleus of the central galaxy of virgo cluster , m87 , collected from the central 10 arcsec of the xmm ( not chandra ) field of view . for the mixing @xmath146 , used in @xcite ,",
    "the flux of dm is about two orders of magnitude below the mekal flux in the energy bin around @xmath152  kev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : webspec ] ) . in the later work @xcite ,",
    "the same data was used to provide an exclusion plot in the @xmath153 parameter space of the form @xmath154 .",
    "statistical analysis of the coma center and coma 3 data , gave very close restrictions .",
    "however , coma 3 represents only one of the observations of coma mosaic , which cover the annular region between @xmath155 and @xmath156 around the center of the coma cluster . by combining these results ,",
    "one effectively increases observation time by about a factor of 10 .",
    "this should lead to the modest improvement of the statistical restriction by about @xmath157 .",
    "we leave this for the future work .",
    "3 .   the restrictions , based on the total flux , can be improved if one moves to the periphery of the cluster .",
    "the farther away from the center one moves , the stronger becomes `` signal - to - background '' ratio ( especially in the case of the coma cluster , c.f .",
    "( [ sb ] ) ) . therefore , one should try to move away from the center of the cluster .",
    "the maximal distance where one can move i restricted by the requirement that the dm decay line is still stronger , than the xrb background ( otherwise one does not gain anything , compared to the restriction  ( [ xrbbound ] ) from xrb ) .",
    "4 .   at the energies above 15 kev , other missions ( such as integral ) should be used to obtain the restrictions on parameters of sterile neutrino .",

    "the simple phenomenological fit to the xmm - newton pn and beppo - sax pds data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the model consists of a powerlaw with a photon index @xmath159 modified at high energies by an exponential cutoff with the cut - off energy @xmath160  kev and by the absorption with column density @xmath161  @xmath162 ( which is roughly the galactic absorption in the direction of coma cluster ) .",
    "several bright x - ray lines are visible in addition to the cut - off powerlaw component .",
    "they are the red - shifted 6.7  kev and 7.0 kev fe k@xmath163 and k@xmath44 lines as well as 0.5  kev and 1.0  kev o and ne lines .",
    "all the components of the model are shown together with the unfolded 0.3 - 50  kev spectrum of the central part of the coma cluster in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath125 of the fit is @xmath164 .",
    "modeling the spectrum of the central part of virgo cluster turns out to be more complicated because more lines are evident in the 1 - 5  kev part of the spectrum .",
    "this can be explained by lower , compared to coma , temeperature of virgo cluster , @xmath165  kev . besides , virgo cluster is a `` cd galaxy dominated '' cluster , which means that the diffuse x - ray emission from the cluster is strongly dominated by emission from the central giant elliptical galaxy m87 .",
    "the size of the x - ray core of m87 is much smaller than the size of x - ray core of coma cluster , so that in spite of the fact that virgo is about 5 times closer to the earth than coma , the angular size of its core , @xmath166  arcmin , is 5 times less than the one for coma .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the temperature of the intracluster ( or intragalactic ) medium varies significantly over the xmm fov , which extends up to @xmath167 .",
    "finally , virgo cluster is not a relaxed galaxy cluster , and assumptions about hydrostatic equilibrium , which one has to evoque to compute the dm distribution may not hold .",
    "the above facts make the modelling of the x - ray spectrum collected from the entire xmm fov difficult .",
    "however , we achieve a satisfactory phenomenological fit the the virgo cluster spectrum with the model similar to the one used in the previous section for coma cluster analysis .",
    "it consists of the powerlaw with the photon index @xmath168 modified at high energies by an exponential cut - off at @xmath169  kev and at low energies by photoelectric absorption on the galactic hydrogen column density @xmath170 .",
    "several lines have to be added to the fit , to make it acceptable .",
    "in particular , fe k@xmath163 and k@xmath44 lines of fe ( 6.7 and 7.9  kev ) , line of o at 0.64  kev , a set of lines at 1  kev from the cooling flow in the center of virgo cluster , etc .",
    "( 7 lines altogether ) .",
    "we repeat the procedure already used for the analysis of the central parts of coma and virgo clusters for the present case .",
    "namely , we find a simple phenomenological fit to the broad - band spectrum which in this case is given by the cutoff powerlaw with @xmath172 and @xmath173 , modified by the galactic absorption .",
    "again , we add several lines ( as in the case of the previous appendix ) to make fit acceptable ."
