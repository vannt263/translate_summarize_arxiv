    "the general trend described above , with old population contributions becoming progressively more important with decreasing radius and young populations dominating the outermost regions ( at radii of about 3 - 5 kpc ) , is in agreement with the stellar population gradients observed by @xcite .",
    "however , these authors ( their fig .  3 ) find that in the nucleus the cak absorption line has equivalent width significantly larger than cah+h@xmath49 .",
    "this discrepancy with our results could be a consequence of a different spatial sampling and size of the extracted regions . while the spatial scale of their spectra is 0@xmath13.7 pixel@xmath16 and they extracted one - dimensional spectra in windows of 2@xmath13.1 in the nuclear regions , our spatial scale is 0@xmath13.336 pixel@xmath16 and the good seeing conditions allowed us to extract nuclear regions @xmath17 1@xmath13 in size along the slit .",

    "indeed , studies of the relative frequency of bars among various hubble types and in different environments have demonstrated that galaxies in close binary systems and some groups have a greater occurrence of bars than field galaxies @xcite .",
    "this result is somewhat controversial , in fact it was recently found @xcite that the bar frequency does not appear to depend on the galaxy environment .",
    "nevertheless , we think that the presence of a bar in at least two out of three members of a galaxy system , like in our case ( since eso381-g006 is edge - on we can not establish whether it is barred or not ) , strongly favors the hypothesis that the mutual interaction has played a role in the bar formation",
    ". further support to this hypothesis is given by the detection of star formation along the bars , which indicate that the bars are still relatively young and actively funneling gas toward the center of the galaxies .",
    "the two galaxies show evidences of only slight morphological distortions ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "specifically , we observe a twist of the inner isophotes , most likely caused by the bars , and an elongation and change of the p.a . of the outermost isophotes of both galaxies toward one another .",
    "additionally , the decentering degree of the most external isophotes with respect to the luminosity center of tol1238 - 364 is higher than the maximum value ( 5% ) found by @xcite for isolated galaxies , indicating a significant asymmetry of the outskirts of the disk likely caused by interaction processes . on the contrary",
    ", eso381-g009 does not exhibit such an asymmetry of the outermost isophotes , but its h@xmath1 image shows an extension of regions , also detectable in the broad band images , on the southern side of the disk , outside the ring - like structure , facing the seyfert galaxy . additionally , the optical images show a plume on its northern side",
    ". this plume appears more extended in the contour maps of the 21 cm line @xcite .",
    "no other tidal features are visible in the optical images , but there are signs of an bridge between tol1238 - 364 and eso381-g006 @xcite . however , since the detection of this bridge is limited to one velocity channel , the possibility that this is a spurious feature can not be excluded .",
    "most of the neutral hydrogen remains located in the discs of the galaxies .",
    "we note that the formation of prominent tidal tails is not ubiquitous in interacting galaxies , but depends on the geometry of the encounters , being particularly favored in prograde interactions , as shown by numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , the seminal work of * ? ? ?",
    "in a recent work , barton gillespie , geller , & kenyon ( 2003 ) identified within a sample of close galaxy pairs a number of galaxies exhibiting triggered star formation but not long tidal tails .",
    "the color profiles of these galaxies show blue dips in their centers , in analogy with the  profile we obtained for the non - active galaxy eso381-g009 .",
    "in fact , we could not identify a real bulge structure in this galaxy , but two knots with high sfr , the brightest of which we adopted as nucleus .",
    "this kind of structure appears in agreement with the gas infall and centrally concentrated star formation predicted by the numerical simulations of @xcite for bulgeless galaxies in the early stages of interactions .",
    "tol1238 - 364 hosts a typical seyfert 2 nucleus , with a hidden blr .",
    "the non - thermal ionization produced by the central power - law source is confined within the first kiloparsec and no evidence of ionization cones is found along the three studied directions .",
    "considerations on the energy budget (   3.4 ) reveal the presence of at least one circumnuclear starburst , a hypothesis that finds support in the observed spectral features . besides the central starbursts ,",
    "a large number of regions are found in both galaxies with a major concentration in the zone of their minimal mutual distance , further supporting the interaction scenario . in eso381-g009 the regions",
    "are mainly located along the bar and in the ring , while in tol1238 - 364 they are diffused all over the disk .",
    "the sfr and the density of sfr are strongly enhanced with respect to normal and/or isolated spirals , and higher in tol1238 - 364 than in its companion ( see   3.4 ) .",
    "this enhancement could be a combined effect of the mutual interactions of the galaxies , as shown by the comparison between the star formation properties of interacting and isolated galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and of the perturbation of the whole galactic disk by the stellar bar @xcite , although the relation between the global star formation and the presence of a bar in a galaxy is still debated .",
    "also , numerical simulations demonstrated that both galaxy interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bars or , in general , non - axisymmetric features ( as summarized e.g. in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can produce torques and gas radial inflows toward the center , inducing nuclear starbursts and/or fueling a central agn .",
    "the regions of both galaxies , whose excitation is in general the effect of photoionization from hot , young stars although in some cases the contribution of starburst driven shocks can not be excluded , exhibit subsolar metallicities . however , the seyfert nucleus shows higher ( solar or even supersolar ) metallicity , with traces of overabundance of nitrogen and sulphur , which could be related to the presence of circumnuclear starburst .",
    "the iras infrared colors confirmed the dual starburst - agn nature of tol1238 - 364 and the simple starburst nature of eso381-g009 , but the infrared emission of the seyfert appears dominated by the active nucleus and shows higher fir luminosity and dust content .",
    "based on the result of their analysis , @xcite suggested that blue central colors , moderate ew(h@xmath1 ) , and small velocity separations in galaxy pairs , are indicative of galaxies that have undergone a close pass and than moved apart , while their triggered burst of star formation ages .",
    "accordingly , numerical simulations by @xcite , showed that two interacting disk / halo galaxies remain relatively unperturbed and show no increase of star forming activity until they reach the perigalacticon .",
    "furthermore , an enhanced star formation activity is also induced in the disks of the galaxies before they reach the widest separation after their first encounter .",
    "the observational properties we have outlined in the present work suggest that this stage of the evolution , i.e. the phase subsequent to a first close passage , might be the case for the galaxy pair under study .",
    "the lack of really prominent morphological distortions might indicate that the galaxy separation is actually larger than appearing in projection on the sky .    in conclusion , although some of the observed properties , taken individually , can be found also in isolated galaxies , when considered all together they provide , in our opinion , a significant indication of an undergoing interaction between two gas - rich galaxies . from our data",
    "we can not establish which role is played by eso381-g006 in the interaction . on the basis of a comparison with the findings in other interacting pairs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the results of galaxy encounter simulations @xcite , we suggest that the galaxy pair has already undergone a first close passage , which determined the onset of bursts of star formation both in the disks and in the central regions , caused moderate morphological distortions , and , possibly , disk instabilities leading to bar formation .",
    "nevertheless , a clear connection of the seyfert activity with the interaction can not be demonstrated and remains at a speculative level .",
