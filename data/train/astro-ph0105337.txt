    "associated absorption lines ( aals ) are important diagnostics of the gaseous environments of quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "in particular , the lines can trace a variety of phenomena  from energetic outflows like the bals to relatively quiescent gas at large galactic or inter - galactic distances ( weymann et al .",
    "1979 , hamann & brandt 2001 ) .",
    "we are involved in a multi - wavelength program to locate individual aal absorbers , determine their elemental abundances , quantify their kinematic and physical properties , and understand the role of the agns and/or host galaxies in providing the source of material and kinetic energy to the absorbing gas .",
    "one interesting property is that , among radio - loud quasars , aals appear more frequently and with greater strength in sources with `` steep '' radio spectra and/or lobe - dominated radio morphologies ( wills et al .",
    "1995 , richards 2001 , brotherton et al .",
    "3c 191 ( q0802 + 103 , emission - line redshift @xmath5 ) is a radio - loud quasar having both strong aals and a bipolar , lobe - dominated radio structure .",
    "it provides a rare opportunity to define the distance between the quasar and the absorbing gas because its aals include excited - state lines , e.g. c ii@xmath1 @xmath6 1336 and si ii@xmath1 @xmath7 1265,1533 , which constrain the volume density and therefore the quasar  absorber distance ( assuming photoionization , bahcall et al .",
    "we observed 3c 191 on three occasions between 1997 and 1998 using the high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) on the keck i telescope on mauna kea , hawaii . on each occasion , a 0.86@xmath8 slit provided spectral resolution @xmath9 or 6.7 km s@xmath10 , corresponding to 3 pixels on the 2048@xmath11 tektronix ccd .",
    "we reduced the data with standard techniques using the makee software package .",
    "the spectra cover the observed wavelengths 3850  5975   and 6474  8927  .",
    "the measured aals have ionizations ranging from mg i to n v , and multi - component profiles that are blueshifted by @xmath0400 to @xmath01400  km / s relative to the quasar s broad emission lines ( see figures 13 )",
    ". these data yield the following new results .  *",
    "( 1 ) * the strengths of excited - state si ii@xmath1 aals indicate a density of @xmath0300 @xmath2 in the si@xmath12 gas .  *",
    "( 2 ) * if the gas is photoionized , this density implies a distance of @xmath028 kpc from the quasar .",
    "several arguments suggest that all of the lines form at approximately this distance , with a range of densities determining the range of ionizations .  *",
    "( 3 ) * strong mg i aals identify neutral gas with very low ionization parameter and high density .",
    "we estimate @xmath13 @xmath2 in this region , compared to only @xmath015 @xmath2 where the n v lines form .  *",
    "( 4 ) * the total column density is @xmath14 @xmath4 in the neutral gas and @xmath15 @xmath4 in the moderately ionized regions ( up to al iii , si iv , etc . ) .",
    "there may be larger column densities in more highly ionized gas , however , the total column of @xmath15 @xmath4 is consistent with 3c 191 s strong soft x - ray flux and the implied absence of soft x - ray absorption .  * ( 5 ) * the total mass in the aal outflow is @xmath16 m@xmath17 , assuming a global covering factor ( as viewed from the quasar ) of @xmath010% .  *",
    "( 6 ) * the absorbing gas only partially covers the background light source(s ) along our line(s ) of sight , requiring absorption in small clouds or filaments @xmath180.01 pc across .",
    "the ratio @xmath19 implies that the clouds have radial ( line - of - sight ) thicknesses @xmath180.2 pc .  * ( 7 ) * the characteristic flow time of the absorbing gas away from the quasar is @xmath0@xmath20 yr .",
    "the physical connection between the quasar 3c 191 and its aals is established by the excited - state lines ( si ii@xmath1 ) . however , the absorber ",
    "quasar distance is very large , @xmath028 kpc .",
    "other quasar aals are known to form much closer to the central engines , possibly within a few pc in outflows similar to the bals ( hamann et al .",
    "1997 , barlow & sargent 1997 , barlow , hamann & sargent 1997 ) . 3c 191 might contain a different class of absorber ( e.g. much farther from the active nucleus ) than the majority of agns discussed at this meeting .",
    "in particular , 3c 191 does not follow the trend identified by brandt et al ( 2000 ) for small x - ray to uv continuum flux ratios ( @xmath21 ) accompanying large c iv absorption equivalent widths .",
    "the outflowing material in 3c 191 might be leftover from a blowout associated with a nuclear starburst , the onset of quasar activity , or a past broad absorption line ( bal ) wind phase .",
    "the flow time of @xmath0@xmath20 yr might therefore represent the time elapsed since the formation of the quasar and/or an accompanying starburst episode .",
    "we propose a model for the 3c 191 absorber ( figure 4 ) in which pockets of dense neutral gas ( represented by mg i @xmath62853 ) are surrounded by a diffuse , spatially extended medium of generally higher ionization ( e.g. c iv and nv ) .",
    "the diffuse clouds contain most of the total column density ; their greater size and/or greater numbers lead to more complete coverage in both velocity and projected area .",
    "more work is needed to characterize fully this class of distant aal absorbers ( see also hamann & brandt 2001 , barlow et al .",
    "1997 , tripp et al .",
    "1996 , morris et al .",
    "1986 ) , and understand its relationship ( if any ) to other absorption phenomena in quasars / agns .",
