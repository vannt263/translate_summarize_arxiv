    "equivalently , when is @xmath6    this very basic question in discrete geometry ( and its higher dimensional analogue ) appears in different guises in algebraic geometry , commutative algebra , and integer programming .",

    ", a lattice polytope @xmath0 is called smooth if it is simple and at every vertex the primitive facet normals generate the dual lattice .",
    "this condition is equivalent to @xmath0 corresponding to an ample divisor on a smooth toric variety .",
    "the case @xmath11 , @xmath12 of this conjecture is the conjecture that _ all smooth lattice polytopes are projectively normal_.    the two - dimensional case of oda s conjecture is now fakhruddin s theorem  @xcite , with an independent proof by ogata  @xcite . in this note",

    "the interior of @xmath30 intersects precisely two edges of @xmath1 , since the strip contains no lattice point in its interior .",
