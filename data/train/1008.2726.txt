    "the maximum entropy ( maxent ) formalism provides an alternative to more conventional statistical mechanics approaches by offering a convenient jumping off point for thinking about problems that are not within the purview of equilibrium statistical mechanics . for non - equilibrium systems , the corresponding idea is called the principle of maximum caliber ( maxcal ) , in which we attempt to determine the probability that a particle travels on a particular space - time path rather than its probability of occupying a certain energy level @xcite .",
    "one way to think about these information - theoretic approaches is that the probability distributions generated by maxent and maxcal are the least - biased inferences about the distributions that can be made on the limited information that is in hand ; i.e. , by maximizing the shannon entropy over the collection of possible outcomes for the system of interest @xcite .",
    "maxent has been used for several decades to model everything from neural firing @xcite to climate change @xcite and many applications between .",
    "maxcal has been subjected to a few applications including analysis of the dynamics of a two - state system @xcite and to examine the origin of phenomenological transport laws including fick s law of diffusion @xcite and fluctuation theorems @xcite .",
    "the maxcal approach is relatively unexplored and has been set forth as a very general method of analyzing nonequilibrium systems @xcite . by applying maxcal to experimentally realizable systems , we hope that we can not only make useful predictions of the behavior of concrete experimental systems , but also help identify and highlight the outstanding theoretical questions that impede progress towards practical use of maxcal .",
    "one such system that we find appealing is the dynamics of a two - state system , partly because of its simplicity and because of the opportunity to manipulate such systems experimentally . to that end , in this paper , we analyze the dynamics of a two - state system , cognizant that it is only one concrete application of the maxcal approach and that much remains to be done to demonstrate maxcal s usefulness more generally .",
    "maxent as used in equilibrium statistical mechanics and maxcal exploit almost entirely the same theoretical prescription , except that maxent as used in equilibrium statistical mechanics identifies the _ entropy_-maximizing probability distribution of particle occupancy over energy states , whereas maxcal identifies the _ caliber_-maximizing probability distribution of particle occupancy over possible space - time paths ( `` microtrajectories '' ) .",
    "caliber is an entropy - like quantity that has the same form as the shannon entropy , @xmath0 . in this equation",
    ", @xmath1 is the caliber , @xmath2 denotes the probability of a given microtrajectory @xmath3 , and each @xmath4 is a macroscopic observable which serves as a constraint within the information - theoretic approach . for convenience",
    ", we will denote an average over the microstates @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "the constants @xmath7 are lagrange multipliers corresponding to those constraints .",
    "maximizing the caliber yields a full probability distribution for all the allowed microtrajectories .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the dynamics of the two - state system using a maxcal model and derive new insights into maxcal and the discretized two - state system in the process .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "background on maxcal is presented in section [ section : background ] . in section [ section :",
    "statisticaldynamics ] , we show that the dynamics of a two - state system are mathematically equivalent to the 1-d ising model , and that there are different but equivalent ways of picking the maxcal constraints . in section [ section :",
    "test ] , we use simulation to investigate the relationship between the maxcal model for the two - state system proposed here and a previously proposed maxcal model for the two - state system @xcite .",
    "as noted above , caliber is an entropy - like quantity that increases as the relative probabilities of the microtrajectories becomes less predictable . as a result of maximizing the caliber",
    ", maxcal asserts that our best guess as to the probability of observing a particular microtrajectory @xmath3 is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a normalization factor dubbed by jaynes as the `` partition functional '' and the @xmath10 are values of macroscopic observables @xmath11 along the microtrajectory labeled @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath12 are the corresponding lagrange multipliers that can be calculated from @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a distinguishing feature of maxcal - derived formulas of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics as compared to more conventional nonequilibrium statistical mechanics formulas , e.g. the jarzynski equality @xcite , is that maxcal solves an inverse problem , in which we infer microscopic properties based on macroscopic observations .",
    "the maxcal distribution described in equation [ eq : maxcalprobgeneral ] is typically generated on the basis of knowing only a small number of macroscopic observables @xmath6 and predicts the probability of traveling any one of the many possible microtrajectories @xmath3 .",
    "for example , in the two - state systems simulated in this paper which each have @xmath14 time steps , only two macroscopic observables are used to generate predictions for the probability of traversing the entirety of the @xmath15 possible microtrajectories . however , since the average probability of observing a particular microtrajectory is typically very small , it is difficult to obtain accurate experimental estimates of @xmath2 itself to which we can compare maxcal predictions . instead , to test the accuracy of a maxcal model , we can predict higher order moments of the joint probability distribution @xmath16 .",
    "these higher moments are more robust than individual microtrajectory probabilities @xmath2 to the depth of our experimental investigation of the system . again",
    ", note that these higher moments are _ not _ used in any way to determine the probability distribution @xmath17 itself .",
    "rather , they are predictions about more nuanced features of the two - state system than those simple average quantities used to establish the distribution given in equation [ eq : maxcalprobgeneral ] .",
    "the dynamics of the two - state system can be completely characterized by rate equations in terms of the constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the intrinsic rate constants for transition from state a to state b and vice versa @xcite .",
    "indeed , one of the interesting outcomes of the present paper is a simple relation between the conventional rate constants and the lagrange multipliers that are central to the maxcal description of the same system .    to make the dynamics of the two - state system amenable to simple maxcal analysis ,",
    "let the maxcal trajectory @xmath3 be a string of @xmath20 s and @xmath21 s describing the state of the system as a function of time . more explicitly ,",
    "suppose that our two - state system is a particle jumping between wells on a double - well potential energy landscape , examples of which are shown in figure [ fig : data ] .",
    "let @xmath22 represent the system s state at time @xmath23 .",
    "if the particle is in the left potential well at time @xmath23 , then we say it is in state @xmath24 and that @xmath25 ; if the particle is in the right potential well at time @xmath23 , then we say it is in state @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus , a particle s trajectory @xmath3 is equivalent to a series of @xmath28 @xmath20 s and @xmath21 s , for which the particle s state is sampled every @xmath29 and the total time spent observing the particles of interest is @xmath30 .    ) .",
    "the traces show the raw data .",
    "states are assigned after boxcar filtering and threshold finding .",
    "( a ) potential well number 1 . see table [ table : parameters2 ] .",
    "the state of lower potential energy is more frequently populated ; there is a high barrier , with infrequent transitions .",
    "( b ) potential well number 8 .",
    "see table [ table : parameters2 ] .",
    "the upper and lower states are populated roughly equally.,width=325 ]    this discretized picture of the two - state process will lead to accurate calculations only if our time step @xmath29 is small enough to capture nearly all state transitions @xcite . in other words , in the language of rate constants , we require that the average waiting time in both states is much larger than the time step @xmath29 . for markov systems ,",
    "the waiting time in a particular state @xmath23 follows an exponential distribution with a mean of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "thus , here , we require @xmath32 , or identically @xmath33 as described previously @xcite . if this heuristic condition is satisfied , missed transitions are negligible .",
    "for the two - well potential landscapes considered here , waiting times range from @xmath34 to @xmath35 s , whereas @xmath36 ms .",
    "there are many different ways that one can imagine characterizing the trajectories realized by the two - state system as it sweeps out a telegraph signal @xcite .",
    "the particular choice that is made has implications in turn for the nature of the maxcal constraints used to describe the system .",
    "however , it is still unclear to us what general criteria must be used when choosing constraints @xmath6 for some specific new problem .",
    "for the two - state system considered here , we focus on two distinct constraints : the average number of times that the particle switches states over the course of a microtrajectory ( @xmath37 ) , and the `` aggregate state '' of the particle ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we define the aggregate state mathematically using the state variable @xmath39 , which was defined earlier in section [ section : statisticaldynamics ] , as @xmath40 , so that @xmath41 where we obtain the average by summing over _ all _ the possible microtrajectories of the system ( labeled by @xmath3 ) , each weighted by its probability @xmath2 .",
    "intuitively , the `` average state '' of the particle ( @xmath42 ) corresponds to a measure of where the particle is most frequently found .",
    "if the particle is frequently found in state a , then @xmath43 ; if the particle is frequently found in state b , then @xmath44 ; and if the particle spends its time equally between the two states , then @xmath45 . in terms of experimental quantities",
    ", the average state is analogous to the average current if we think of the telegraph signal as the current passing through an ion channel in a single - channel measurement @xcite .    with these two constraints and the maxcal formalism described above",
    ", we find that the discretized version of the partition functional takes the simple form @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the lagrange multipliers associated with our two constraints .",
    "the probability of observing a particular microtrajectory is accordingly @xmath49 more precisely , this expression provides the probability of observing a particular microtrajectory @xmath3 with aggregate state @xmath50 and number of switches @xmath51 , where the subscript @xmath3 labels the trajectory of interest .    to cast this expression in a more useful way , we notice that @xmath52 can be expressed in terms of @xmath22 using the quantity @xmath53 , which compares the state of the system at two subsequent instants in time and is @xmath20 when the particle switches states and @xmath54 otherwise .",
    "then , @xmath55 and from combining this fact with equation [ eq : totalstate ] , equation [ eqz1 ] can be rewritten as @xmath56 let @xmath57 .",
    "then @xmath58    the partition function in equation [ eqz2 ] looks like the partition function for the 1-d ising model . in this context",
    ", a spin at position @xmath59 corresponds to the particle s state at time @xmath23 ; the lattice spacing @xmath60 corresponds to the time step @xmath29 ; @xmath48 is analogous to the applied magnetic field ; and @xmath61 is the analog of the coupling constant between spins . in the ising model , the magnetic field drives spins to prefer one direction over another and the coupling constant drives neighboring spins to align . in the two - state system analogy considered here , the `` magnetic field '' drives the particle to favor one of the two potential wells , and the `` coupling constant '' recognizes that particle s state at time @xmath62 depends on its state at time @xmath23 and thus is responsible for the temporal correlations of the system .",
    "this analogy will be discussed further in section [ section : markovrelation ] .",
    "the most convenient scheme for determining the partition function in equation [ eqz2 ] analytically is to exploit periodic boundary conditions .",
    "though it is natural in the context of spins to talk about periodic boundary conditions , such conditions in our dynamical problem correspond nonsensically to time running in circles .",
    "nevertheless , the mathematical convenience of periodic boundary conditions makes them an attractive mathematical option .",
    "( the errors incurred in making this simplifying assumption are discussed later . ) under the assumption of periodic boundary conditions , the 1-d ising model partition function can be evaluated analytically using transfer matrices as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix @xmath66 @xcite .    as usual in maximum entropy problems ,",
    "the values of the lagrange multipliers are found by evaluating partial derivatives of @xmath67 @xcite . in particular , we need @xmath68 and @xmath69 equations [ eq : lm_h , i ] and [ eq : lm_j , ns ] are transcendental and can be solved numerically .      even though equations [ eq : lm_h , i ] and [ eq : lm_j , ns ] are transcendental , we can find closed - form expressions for @xmath48 and @xmath61 in terms of the rate constants @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the time step @xmath29 by relating a previously used two - state maxcal partition functional to the one used here . in an earlier maxcal analysis of the two - state system , the constraints @xmath70 and @xmath71 were used instead of @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite @xcite . the quantity",
    "@xmath74 reports the number of time instants of length @xmath29 out of a total of @xmath28 such time steps where the particle moved from state @xmath59 to state @xmath75 . the maxcal partition function using this alternative set of constraints is @xmath76 where",
    "each @xmath3 is a different microtrajectory .",
    "note that the four constraints @xmath77 and @xmath78 are not linearly independent , since the particle can only start in state a or b and move to state a or b in each of the @xmath28 time steps .",
    "this constraint is captured by the relation @xmath79 to relate these constraints to @xmath51 and @xmath50 , note that the total number of times that the particle switches states is the sum of the number of times it switches from state @xmath24 to state @xmath26 and vice versa , @xmath80 additionally , the average state of the particle is the weighted sum of the amount of time it spends in state @xmath24 and the amount of time it spends in state @xmath26 , @xmath81 under the assumption of periodic boundary conditions used to calculate the partition function in section [ section : isingmodel ] , the particle must start and end in the same state , and therefore switch from state b to state a just as many times as it switches from state a to state b resulting in the constraint @xmath82 the equations [ eq : constraintrelation1]-[eq : constraintrelation4 ] above allow us to solve for the @xmath74 quantities in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , namely , @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath85 if we substitute equations [ eqnaa ] , [ eqnbb ] , and [ eqnab ] into equation [ eqzold ] , we find that @xmath86 therefore , the probability of the particle moving along a particular microtrajectory @xmath3 is @xmath87    to recapitulate , we have two different maxcal formulations of the two - state system dynamics , derived from two apparently different sets of constraints .",
    "their partition functions are given by equation [ eqz1 ] and equation [ eqz3 ] .",
    "both models accurately describe the two - state system , as shown in section [ section : test ] and reference @xcite .",
    "we can impose the consistency condition that both models have the same predictions for @xmath2 , and hence they must have the same lagrange multiplier coefficients for @xmath51 and @xmath50 . as a result , we can prescribe the equivalence of the two formulations through the relations @xmath88 and @xmath89 recall that these lagrange multipliers are @xcite @xmath90 these statistical weights are markovian in nature : @xmath91 is the probability that the particle will transition from state a to state b in the time interval @xmath29 , @xmath92 is the probability that the particle will transition from state b to state a in the time interval @xmath29 , and so on .",
    "the alternative interpretation is that according to equation [ eqalpha ] , the `` coupling constant '' increases as dwell times increase ; equation [ eqmu ] suggests that the `` magnetic field '' increases as state a is favored over state b and vice versa .",
    "note that the calculations in @xcite used exact boundary conditions , whereas equation [ eqz2 ] exploited the analytic convenience of periodic boundary conditions . as a result ,",
    "any differences between the predictions of the two maxcal partition functionals is an inheritance of the difference in boundary conditions . in this way",
    ", we can measure to what extent potentially false assumptions about boundary conditions will affect the validity of moment predictions .",
    "as we will see later , the particular choice of boundary conditions are practically irrelevant for the systems considered here because the particles are observed for many time steps .",
    "we wish to test our maxcal model by comparing theoretical predictions to data obtained from simulations or experimental measurements of a two - state system . in an earlier paper , we described the use of a dual - well optical trap that could be used to sculpt different two - state trajectories by tuning the properties of the adjacent wells @xcite . in this paper , we continue along similar lines , but instead using simulated data for this system like that shown in figure [ fig : data ] .",
    "trajectories were simulated according to the langevin equation subject to an external potential @xcite , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a potential of the form @xmath95 meant to mimic the two - well landscape imposed by the optical traps .",
    "the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 give the x - coordinates on which each well is centered ; the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 refer to the width of each potential well ; and @xmath100 and @xmath101 refer to the depth of each well . in simulations ,",
    "parameters @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 were kept constant .",
    "however , fifteen different combinations of @xmath100 and @xmath101 were used to simulate fifteen different double potential wells .",

    "this indifference to boundary conditions can also be seen by testing equations [ eqalpha ] and [ eqmu ] derived for lagrange multipliers in section [ section : markovrelation ] . recall that those equations hold only if periodic boundary conditions and exact boundary conditions lead to equivalent results , and therefore any deviation from the equations is due entirely to a difference in boundary conditions .",

    "indeed , for some quantities we have not even been able to figure out how to compute them using the master equation treatment .",
    "the ease of these calculations in the maxcal setting results from the fact that the moments of the probability distribution @xmath151 are simply partial derivatives of the partition function @xmath67 in our maxcal model , and in the master equation formalism , one must calculate @xmath151 from @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate autocorrelations using the master equation formalism via a linear differential equation ; the same quantity can be calculated from maxcal using transfer matrices .",
    "both in classical equilibrium thermodynamics and statistical mechanics and in the thermodynamics of small departures from equilibrium , there are broad classes of relations such as the maxwell relations and the onsager relations that illustrate the mathematical linkage of quantities that at first blush might seem unrelated . in some cases ,",
    "the simplest way to explain these relations is that they reflect equality of certain second - order mixed partial derivatives .",
    "the maximum caliber formalism admits similar relations @xcite . in the language of trajectories , what these relations tell us is that if we have measured properties such as @xmath72 and @xmath73 on one two - well landscape , we can predict what the dynamics will be like on a `` nearby '' landscape without doing any further measurements .    in this maxcal model ,",
    "maxwell - like relations fall out as the equality of mixed partial derivatives of @xmath152 .",
    "for example , the statement that @xmath153 leads to @xmath154 other results can be obtained from higher - order mixed partial derivatives , e.g. @xmath155 yields @xmath156 .",
    "it still remains to see how to turn such relations into general useful predictive tools for the design and interpretation of experiments .",
    "in summary , we have studied a single colloidal particle undergoing a two - state process with stationary rates , though the problem with time - varying rates is of great interest .",
    "this classic problem is studied using the theory of maximum caliber . by measuring relatively short trajectories ( @xmath157 one hour ) , we are able to find the full probability distribution of trajectories from a maxcal model using the average frequency of state - switching and the average state as constraints , and confirm that the predicted trajectory distribution agrees with simulated data . additionally , we show that the `` markov - like '' constraints used in an earlier maxcal analysis of the two - state system @xcite differs from the maxcal analysis presented here only via a difference in boundary conditions .",
    "the mapping of the ising - like maxcal model onto the markov - like maxcal model allows us to assign a physical interpretation to the lagrange multipliers .",
    "mapping two - state dynamics onto a one - dimensional ising model yields unexpected insights into two - state dynamics , even though the master equations that describe two - state kinetics have been used for decades .",
    "first , we show that the dynamics of the two - state system can be mapped onto a 1-d ising model whose `` coupling constant '' and `` magnetic field '' can be written explicitly in terms of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath29 .",
    "then we derive several relationships that hold true specifically for discretized two - state systems , i.e. the expressions depend on the time step @xmath29 as well as the rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we derive and verify expressions for the moments of the joint probability distribution @xmath151 , which to the best of our knowledge have not been derived previously using the traditional master equation formalism or anything else .",
    "next we derive and verify an expression for the autocorrelation functions @xmath149 and @xmath150 in a discretized system .",
    "it is possible that these new formulas will be of practical value to those who study systems that can be modeled as two - state systems , e.g. ion channels and ligand - receptor complexes .",
