    "this paper provides some mathematical details of part of a broader project we call  coherent modeling of macroevolution \" .",
    "the focus here is on a novel mathematical framework and on analytical results for a model of macroevolution which is possible within this framework .",
    "we give only a very brief sketch of the motivation for the project in section [ sec - overview ] and then proceed to outline ( section [ sec - results ] ) the specific results of this paper .",
    "a future paper @xcite addressed to less mathematically - focused biologists will provide more detailed background , motivation , relation with previous biological literature , and discuss the  bottom line for biology \" of such mathematical models .",
    "stochastic models for time series of species numbers within a clade and for phylogenetic trees of extant species in a clade can be traced back to yule @xcite .",
    "such models treat speciations and extinctions as random ( in some way ) . in studying such models",
    "one is not asserting that real macroevolution was purely random ; rather , one wishes to compare real data with the predictions of a random model to see what patterns require biological explanation ( e.g. adaptive radiations @xcite ) , or to make inference about unobservables ( e.g. the time of origin of the primates @xcite ) .",
    "one aspect of this subject is where the data consists of time series or phylogenetic trees on some higher - level taxa ( genera or families , say ) instead of species . in the fossil record of the distant past",
    "it is difficult to resolve specimens to the species level , and the species - level data is liable to be incomplete , so that statistical analysis of time series ( relying e.g. on the celebrated compendia of sepkoski @xcite ) is in practice done at the level of genera or families . in discussing phylogenies within large extant groups such as birds or mammals , it is impractical to show all species , so one shows trees indicating how major subgroups are related .",
    "and the same holds for extinct groups ( see e.g. the fascinating tree @xcite on dinosaur genera ) . in looking at such data and asking the basic question  what patterns imply biological effect rather than being consistent with",
    "just chance \"  two extra difficulties arise .",
    "first , the classification into genera or families involves human judgement which is inevitably at least somewhat subjective .",
    "second , while one could just take genera ( say ) as entities in themselves and apply species - level models directly to genera @xcite , this seems conceptually unsatisfactory : genera are sets of species and so , as part of  _ coherent _ modeling of macroevolution \" , one would like genus - level models to be based upon underlying species - level models .",
    "while these difficulties are certainly mentioned in the biological literature , we have not seen any very thorough mathematical study .",
    "our purposes in this paper are to lay out a conceptual framework for studying such questions , and then to give mathematical analysis of the predictions of a particular probability model .      the first topic concerns methodology of classification ( without any involvement of probability models ) .",
    "suppose we know the true phylogenetic tree on a _ clade _ of species , that is on some founder species @xmath0 ( typically extinct ) and the set of all descendant species ( extant and extinct ) of @xmath0 .",
    "how might one assign species to genera ?",
    "( from now on we write _ genus , genera _ for concreteness to indicate any higher level of the taxonomic hierarchy ) .",
    "suppose we distinguish certain species as  new type \" due to some characteristic judged biologically significant which persists in descendant species .",
    "then it seems sensible to use these as a basis for classification  very roughly , a ",
    "new type \" species is the founder of a new genus .",
    "this set - up ignores various practical problems ( one seldom has the complete tree on extinct species ; which characteristics should one choose as significant ? ) but does lead us to a purely mathematical question :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ consider a _ classification scheme _ which , given any phylogenetic tree in which some species are distinguished as  new type \" , classifies all species into genera .",
    "what desirable properties can such schemes have ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    section [ sec - class ] gives our answer .",
    "one might hope there was some single mathematically natural scheme , but it turns out that different desiderata dictate different schemes .",
    "we pick out three schemes which we name _ fine , medium , coarse _ and describe their properties .",
    "studying to what extent actual taxonomic practice resembles one of these theoretical schemes would make an interesting project in statistical analysis , but this is not our purpose here . instead , as our second topic we use these theoretical classification schemes to consider the questions :    * in what ways might phylogenetic trees on genera , or time series of genera , differ from those on species ? * in",
    "what ways might phylogenetic trees on species in the same @xmath1-species genus differ from phylogenetic trees on species of simply an @xmath1-species clade ?",
    "( section [ sec - pmhot ] amplifies the issue here . )",
    "* how does the choice of classification scheme for determining genera affect such differences ?",
    "we study these questions under a certain probability model for the underlying phylogenetic tree on species .",
    "this model , described in section [ sec - species - level ] and studied in detail in @xcite , is intended to formalize the idea of  purely random \" history subject to a given number @xmath1 of extant species .",
    "section [ sec - analysis ] investigates the statistical structure of phylogenies on genera obtained by combining the species - level model with the genera classification schemes , and this combination is the conceptual novelty of the paper .",
    "in particular we derive formulas ( theorem [ t2 ] ) for the lifetime of genera and for the distribution of number of species per genus , and formulas ( propositions [ p4 ] and [ p5 ] ) for the offspring structure of the tree on genera , both of these results in the ( mathematically easier ) case of extinct clades ; and ( for extant clades ) the number of species per genus ( proposition [ p6 ] ) .",
    "as noted in section [ sec - analysis ] there are many more calculations one might attempt to perform , and we invite interested readers to extend our calculations .",
    "for good reasons , both practical and theoretical , phylogenetic relationships are usually presented via a _ cladogram _ , a binary tree ( cf . figure 4 ) without time scale and without identifying branchpoints with explicit taxa .",
    "a mathematical discussion of genera classification schemes would be simpler if it were based only on the reduced information provided by cladograms on species .",
    "but our goal is to see how phylogenies on genera emerge from some complete underlying process of macroevolution at the species level in which species originate and go extinct at particular times .",
    "this requires using a species - level model on _ phylogenetic trees _ as defined below , even though ultimately one may choose to express relationships between genera using cladograms .",
    "our basic assumptions about macroevolution in a clade of species are logically simple , although oversimplified in reality .    *",
    "each species has a  time of origin \" and either is extant or has a  time of extinction \" ; * each species ( except the founder of the clade ) originates as a  daughter \" of some  parent \" species in the clade , not simultaneously with any other daughter .",

    "<S> we present a general framework for such models , and describe three alternate classification schemes . combining with the species - level model of aldous - popovic ( 2005 ) </S>",
    "<S> , one gets models for higher - order trees , and we initiate analytic study of such models . in particular we derive formulas for the lifetime of genera , for the distribution of number of species per genus , and for the offspring structure of the tree on genera . </S>"
