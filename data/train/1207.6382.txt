    "since the first successful experiments in observing bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in cold trapped atoms @xcite , there have been dramatic advances into strongly interacting ( via feshbach resonances @xcite ) and strongly correlated regimes ( e.g. , within optical lattices @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can still speak of a ` typical ' bec experiment as consisting of a weakly interacting gas of alkali atoms , held within a confining potential formed by laser or magnetic fields , where the condensate fraction incorporates the substantial majority of constituent atoms . in this chapter",
    "we will describe perturbative approaches , based around the existence of such a significant condensate fraction , in such a way that the many - body system is in a number eigenstate ( number conserving ) rather than a coherent state ( symmetry breaking ) the material presented here is intended to be a systematized amalgam of the presentations of c. w. gardiner @xcite , castin and dum @xcite , and of s. a. gardiner and morgan @xcite , with some additional observations .",
    "we begin by contrasting so - called number - conserving approaches with the more conventional assumption of symmetry - breaking , also addressing the motivation for considering a number - conserving alternative , before describing number - conserving equivalents to the quadratic bogolibov hamiltonian @xcite and the linearized bogoliubov - de gennes equations @xcite .",
    "we then cover extending this approach to a second - order minimal self - consistent treatment of dynamics , before concluding with considerations of implementation , validity and application . throughout , due to the preponderance of explicit time - dependences , @xmath0 arguments will only appear when a new quantity is introduced , as appropriate .",
    "our starting point is the bosonic binary interaction hamiltonian @xmath1 where the field operators obey @xmath2 = \\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'})$ ] , and @xmath3 ; @xmath4 is an external potential , @xmath5 is the atomic mass , and @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the s - wave scattering length .",
    "the binary interaction here is characterised by a contact term @xmath8 , with the conditions for which a renormalization of the consequent ultraviolet divergences is necessary described elsewhere @xcite . the number operator @xmath9 commutes with @xmath10 ; particle number is therefore conserved , and stationary states of @xmath10 must also be eigenstates of @xmath11 .",
    "if ( as is commonly assumed ) one defines the condensate as @xmath12 ( the _ mean field _ ) @xcite , the field operator can be written @xmath13 with fluctuations defined by @xmath14 . a scalar function , @xmath15 has everywhere a well - defined phase , and the @xmath16 gauge symmetry of the system is _",

    "_ eigenstate implies @xmath20 .",
    "data is often statistically averaged from repeated experimental runs , which are unlikely to have identical shot - to - shot particle numbers  nevertheless , if each run is for a definite ( even if unknown ) particle number , @xmath21 is still @xmath22 ( one has an incoherent statistical ensemble of number eigenstates , rather than a coherent superposition ) .",
