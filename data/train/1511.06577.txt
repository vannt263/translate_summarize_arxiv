    "the study of rings goes back to aharonov and bohm ( ab ) who demonstrated the importance of vector potentials in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this goes under the name ab effect and one frequently uses the term ab oscillations for the oscillations in the resistance of a ring as a function of the flux penetrating the interior of the ring . another major study is now referred to as the aharonov - casher@xcite effect which is similar to the ab effect but it is due to the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "other developments concern the berry phase @xcite . with the development of new fabrication techniques and the size reduction of samples ,",
    "rings are now very intensely studied especially in connection with the soi , see refs . - and references cited therein .    in a quantum ring of finite width the connection between the current - carrying leads and the ring can be complicated and may lead to reflection at the lead - ring junction and to asymmetric injection in the two arms of the ring . this asymmetry can be a consequence of the difference in length between the upper and lower arms or of fabrication defects but it can also be induced by a magnetic field as a consequence of the lorentz force .",
    "such an asymmetry was demonstrated recently from a pure numerical treatment of the transmission through a finite - width lead - ring system ; it led to incomplete ab oscillations due to partially destructive interferences @xcite .    to our knowledge all previous works that study transmission through a ring employ an @xmath2 matrix that is _ symmetric _ with respect to both arms of the ring @xcite-@xcite .",
    "though this may not be as restrictive as it sounds , it is more realistic to reexamine the problem using an @xmath2 matrix that is _ not symmetric _ with respect to both arms of the ring and possibly make a connection with the asymmetry mentioned above @xcite .",
    "an asymmetry can be introduced by placing , e.g. , one scatterer in one arm of the ring or by locally applying a gate that affects the properties of one arm",
    ". the scatterer may introduce important phase shifts in the electron wave function and change drastically the position and/or amplitude of the ab oscillations .",
    "this has been thoroughly investigated theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "although we will consider such a case , here we are mainly concerned with _ asymmetric _ current injection into the arms of the ring through one of the leads , cf .",
    "fig . 1 .    in view of the above ,",
    "we propose a 1d model in which asymmetries due to fabrication , scatterers , and especially asymmetric current injection through one of the leads are parametrized by a small number of parameters but which leads to explicit analytical results .",
    "this has the advantage of being more useful to experimentalists than the pure numerical treatment of ref . .",
    "in the next section we formulate the problem and derive analytic expressions for the transmission amplitude .",
    "we present analytical results in sec .",
    "iii and numerical results in secs .",
    "iv and v. concluding remarks follow in sec . vi .",
    "at each junction of a lead with the ring , indicated by the triangles in fig . 1 , we have three outgoing waves with amplitudes @xmath3 and three incoming waves with amplitudes @xmath4 .",
    "they are related by a @xmath5 @xmath2 matrix in the manner     connected to two leads , indicated by triangular arrows , with two elastic scatterers indicated by the black squares .",
    "the transmission and reflection amplitudes of the scatterers are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "a flux @xmath8 pierces the ring through its center , width=302 ]    @xmath9    current conservation implies that @xmath2 is unitary and time - reversal invariance , when applicable , entails @xmath10 .",

    "this change reflects the fact that the results should be the same when the asymmetric injection favors equally the upper or lower arm .",
    "the reflection probability at the left junction is @xmath19 .",

    "these two limits correspond to those of @xmath22 in ref .",
    "@xcite being , respectively , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it can be invoked that the probability of perfect reflection at the left junction should be independent of the asymmetry of the ring with respect to the two arms .",
    "therefore , one should have @xmath25 .",
    "it will be shown later in a different way that indeed one has @xmath25 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) relates the amplitudes of the incoming waves to those of the outgoing ones . for the usual scattering from the left we take @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
