    "figure  [ fig:2torus ] shows the double - torus  @xmath0 , beloved of low - dimensional topologists .",
    "the subscript 2 on @xmath0 stands for the number of handles , or _",
    "genus_. though it is nt    l.4        encountered very much in the real world , it is a surface that s complex enough to be interesting , unlike the humble ordinary torus @xmath1 which is a bit too trivial .",
    "we are interested in transformations of a surface @xmath2 , i.e. , continuous mappings of  @xmath2 to itself .",
    "such a mapping , if also invertible , is called a homeomorphism of  @xmath2 .",
    "( we assume that the surface is orientable , and that the mapping preserves this orientation . ) now in topology one only cares about gross features , so we assume that two mappings are equivalent if they can be continuously deformed into each other : they are then called _",
    "isotopic_. an equivalence class of mappings under isotopy",
    "is called an _",
    "isotopy class_. the set of all such classes forms the _ mapping class group _ @xmath3 of  @xmath2 , with the group operation obtained from composition of mappings .",
    "the mapping class group of the torus @xmath1 is particularly simple : after we allow for isotopy , all that matters is how many times a mapping @xmath4 has caused us to wind around each of the two periodic directions of the torus .",
    "this winding is best illustrated by looking at the action of a mapping on two nontrivial disjoint closed curves drawn on the surface , as in figure  [ fig : torus ] .",
    "the red loop around the thin direction of the torus is labeled @xmath5 , the blue loop @xmath6 .",
    "the mapping in figure  [ fig : torus ] can be written as @xmath7 : its linear action transforms the red loop to @xmath8 and the blue loop to @xmath9 , which indicates the number of twists of each image loop around each periodic direction of the torus .",
    "in fact , in general we have @xmath10 ( the `` projective '' version of the group of invertible two - by - two matrices with determinant 1 ) , since we can wind in positive as well as negative directions , and the action of  @xmath11 on these loops is commutative in the case of the torus .",
    "note that since the loops initially only intersect once , then their images only intersects once as well .",
    "r.4        according to the celebrated thurston ",
    "nielsen ( tn ) classification theorem ,  @xcite there are only three types of isotopy classes : finite - order , reducible , and pseudo - anosov .",
    "a mapping @xmath12 is finite - order if  @xmath13 is isotopic to the identity map , for some integer  @xmath14 .",
    "the mapping @xmath11 is reducible if it leaves a set of disjoint closed curves invariant : the surface is carved up such that the pieces map to each other .",
    "finite - order mappings are not interesting to us because they are too simple ; reducible ones are not interesting because one can then reapply the tn theorem to the individual pieces ( with boundaries ) until the mapping is no longer reducible .",
    "it is the third type  pseudo - anosov  that is most dynamically interesting .",
    "for such a mapping , in addition to leaving no nontrivial closed curve `` untouched '' ( otherwise it would be reducible ) , the action on loops causes their length to grow exponentially .",
    "@xcite the asymptotic factor by which the winding numbers of loops is multiplied ( under repeated iteration ) is called the _ dilatation _ , @xmath15 .",
    "its logarithm is the _",
    "topological entropy_. the topological entropy is closely related to the growth rate of loops , as discussed for the cat s cradle and stirring device examples in the introduction .",
    "the positive entropy of a pseudo - anosov mapping tells us that loops will grow exponentially under repeated iteration , with growth rate  @xmath16 .    for the torus  @xmath1",
    ", the tn classification is achieved merely by looking at the trace of an element of @xmath10 .",
    "if the absolute value of the trace is greater than 2 , then the mapping is pseudo - anosov ;  @xcite if less than 2 , finite - order ; if equal to 2 , reducible .",
    "@xcite one can check this easily by using the cayley ",
    "hamilton theorem for two - by - two matrices of unit determinant .",
    "the mapping of the torus in figure  [ fig : torus ] , for instance , is pseudo - anosov with  @xmath17 .",
    "now let us return to the double - torus  @xmath0 .",
    "the mapping class group in this case is more complicated than for the torus , but we can get a handle on part of it by considering @xmath18  the subset of the mapping class group that also leaves invariant a vector field ( as opposed to a line field in the general case ) . in that case",
    "the mapping class group can be deduced from the action on the four loops drawn in figure  [ fig:2torus ] , so that @xmath19 .  @xcite but this time we do not have equality :",
    "there are many matrices that do not correspond to an element of the mapping class group .",
    "but which ones ?    the matrices we want are in the _ symplectic group _ @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite one important feature of these matrices is that their characteristic polynomial @xmath21 satisfies  @xmath22 , @xmath23 , so that the polynomial is _ reciprocal _  the coefficients read the same from left to right as from right to left .",
    "the largest root ( in magnitude ) of  @xmath24 is the dilatation @xmath25 ; for a pseudo - anosov mapping it is always real .",
    "we appeal to the _ lefschetz fixed point theorem _ , which in our case says @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is an integer called the lefschetz number of @xmath11 ; @xmath28 is a matrix representing the isotopy class of @xmath11 by looking at its action on the loops in figure  [ fig:2torus ] ; @xmath29 is the trace ; @xmath30 is the set of isolated fixed points of  @xmath11 ; and @xmath31 is the _ topological index _ of @xmath11 at the    r.52        isolated fixed point @xmath32 .",
    "the topological index is given by the signed number of turns of a vector joining a point  @xmath33 and its image  @xmath34 as @xmath33 travels counterclockwise around a small circle enclosing the singularity ( see figure  [ fig : index_sing6 ] ) .",
    "the index can only assume two simple values : it is  @xmath35 if  @xmath11 fixes the @xmath36 ` hyperbolic sectors ' around a fixed point , and it is  @xmath37 ( independent of  @xmath38 ) if  @xmath11 permutes the sectors .",
    "@xcite this is due to the severe restrictions imposed by continuity and orientation - preservation .",
    "@xcite    now comes the first crucial ingredient : the cayley  hamilton theorem and newton s formulas  @xcite tell us how to find @xmath39 recursively by looking at the polynomial  @xmath24 : @xmath40 where  @xmath41 for  @xmath42 .",
    "hence , we can calculate the lefschetz numbers of all powers of  @xmath11 directly from the polynomial .",
    "for example , for the polynomial  @xcite @xmath43 with dilatation  @xmath44 , we find @xmath45 the second crucial ingredient is that the index @xmath31 at a fixed point @xmath32 is heavily constrained . around a fixed point ,",
    "the vector field that remains invariant under  @xmath11 can have a singularity , near which the mapping s action can be divided into  @xmath36 hyperbolic sectors as in figure  [ fig : index_sing6 ] , with  @xmath38 even .",
    "assuming the polynomial  @xmath24 has a positive dominant root , then as mentioned above there are two cases : @xmath46 if @xmath11 fixes the sectors at  @xmath32 ( left in figure  [ fig : index_sing6 ] ) ; @xmath47 if it permutes the sectors ( right in figure  [ fig : index_sing6 ] ) . for technical reasons ,",
    "@xcite a permutation involves only @xmath48 of the sectors .",
    "let s see what we can glean from this for the case of the polynomial above : on a surface of genus two , the euler ",
    "poincar formula dictates @xmath49 where  @xmath50 is the euler characteristic of the surface  @xmath0 , and  @xmath51 is the number of hyperbolic sectors at a fixed point  @xmath32 .",
    "note first that if  @xmath52 the fixed point contributes nothing to the left side ( from now on we drop the  @xmath32 subscript from  @xmath53 ) , so according to the formula we can have any number of fixed points of this type .",
    "these are called _ regular fixed points _ , and can only have a index of  @xmath54 ( @xmath55 , so the only permutation of sectors is the identity ) . then , ignoring regular fixed points , the only possibilities for singularities are either one with  @xmath56 , or two with  @xmath57 ( recall  @xmath38 must be even ) .",
    "first consider the case of two singularities with  @xmath57 .",
    "since  @xmath58 , at least one of the singularities must be fixed with its sectors permuted , since this is the only way to get a positive index .",
    "when @xmath57 the permutation involves only two sectors , so @xmath59 will fix the sectors and the singularity will have an index of @xmath60 .",
    "however , the other singularity can contribute at most  @xmath37 to @xmath61 , so this is incompatible with the lefschetz number @xmath62 .",
    "we conclude that this polynomial can not correspond to a pseudo - anosov mapping involving two singularities with  @xmath57 .",
    "now consider the second case : one singularity with  @xmath56 .",
    "since  @xmath58 , the sectors must be permuted to get a positive index .",
    "when  @xmath56 the permutation involves  @xmath63 sectors ( figure  [ fig : index_sing6 ] ) .",
    "therefore ,  @xmath59 also permutes the sectors ( so that the singularity contributes  @xmath37 to the lefschetz number ) and @xmath64 fixes the sectors ( so the singularity contributes  @xmath65 ) .",
    "then , in order to match the lefschetz number  @xmath66 there must be two regular fixed points , which together make a regular period-2 orbit .",
    "regular fixed points must appear at a multiple of their period ( that is , a period-@xmath67 orbit becomes  @xmath67 fixed points of @xmath68 , etc . ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that a period-2 regular orbit exists , so that @xmath69 , as required .    next , for the third iterate  @xmath64 ,",
    "the lefschetz number is  @xmath70 : this is fine since the 3 sectors of our  @xmath56 singularity are now unpermuted , and the index is thus  @xmath71 .",
    "this means that there are no regular orbits of period 3 . for the fourth iterate , we have  @xmath72 again , but this time our main singularity has its sectors permuted , so its index is  @xmath37 .",
    "our earlier period-2 orbits appear at this iterate and contribute  @xmath73 , and that leaves a deficit of  @xmath74 , which is accounted for by invoking a single period-4 orbit .",
    "let s look at one final iterate : for the fifth one  @xmath75 , so something big is happening .",
    "our main singularity with  @xmath56 still has its sectors permuted , so its contribution is  @xmath37 .",
    "no other periodic orbits that we ve encountered before can contribute , since 5 is a prime iterate .",
    "hence , the deficit of  @xmath76 must be entirely made up by _ three _",
    "period-5 orbits .",
    "so far the tally is ( i ) a single fixed point with  @xmath56 ; ( ii ) a regular ( @xmath77 ) period-2 orbit ; ( iii ) a regular period-4 orbit ; and ( iv ) three regular period-5 orbits . of course",
    ", we can keep going , but we have made our point : the list of lefschetz numbers allows us to deduce which periodic orbits must appear at each iterate .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the list is not arbitrary : there are many sequences of lefschetz numbers that would be inconsistent , in the sense that no compatible periodic - orbit structure exists .",
    "what is remarkable is that all this information can be obtained from a simple polynomial .",
    "the tools discussed so far allow us to answer an interesting question : for a given surface of genus  @xmath78 , what is the ` simplest ' pseudo - anosov mapping ?",
    "by simplest , we mean the one with the least dilatation  @xmath25 , which we call  @xmath79 ( the ` + ' superscript corresponds to  @xmath80 ) .",
    "this is a question that has occupied some low - dimensional topologists for 20 years , ever since penner first posed it .",
    "originally it was nt clear how this ` minimizer ' should behave with the genus , but better and better examples were constructed , and currently the best general bound stands at  @xmath81 , implying that the minimizer converges to unity for large genus .",
    "@xcite in fact , this bound is sharp for  @xmath82  @xcite and @xmath83 ,  @xcite but explicit pseudo - anosov mappings have been found with dilatation below the bound for  @xmath84 .",
    "@xcite in genus 5 , the pseudo - anosov mapping associated with  @xmath85 has the mysterious lehmer s number  @xmath86 as a dilatation .",
    "@xcite moreover , the minimum dilatations for genus 2 to 5 are all _ salem numbers _ : these are roots of polynomials with only one eigenvalue outside the unit circle in the complex plane .",
    "@xcite nobody knows what happens in general for higher genus .    in ref .",
    "we used a very direct method to prove , amongst others things , the minimality of the salem numbers  @xmath87 ,  @xmath88 , and  @xmath89 . here , we illustrate the method for genus 3 : start with the polynomial associated with the candidate pseudo - anosov mapping , whose dilatation is believed to give  @xmath90 , in this case @xmath91 with dilatation  @xmath92 . now",
    "how many degree 6 , reciprocal , integer - coefficient polynomials have a largest real root that is less than this dilatation ?",
    "a simple computer search tells us that the list is very small : there is only one , which can be factored as @xmath93 , with lefschetz numbers @xmath94 where  @xmath11 is the hypothetical pseudo - anosov mapping .",
    "since there are a finite number of possible singularities ( because of the euler ",
    "poincar formula with  @xmath95 ) , we can check if this sequence of lefschetz numbers is possible . because  @xmath96 , @xmath11 must fix at least three singularities .",
    "for instance , assume that  @xmath11 fixes one singularity with  @xmath56 , permuting its sectors as in figure  [ fig : index_sing6 ] , and two with  @xmath57 with their  @xmath48 sectors permuted",
    ". then  @xmath59 will fix the sectors of the two singularities with  @xmath57 , and each singularity will contribute  @xmath97 to the lefschetz number , for a total of  @xmath98 .",
    "but from above ,  @xmath62 , which is not possible : there is no way to make the lefschetz number more positive by adding regular orbits , since they contribute negatively .",
    "hence ,  @xmath11 can not fix these three types of singularities .",
    "there is only one other possible case  four singularities with  @xmath57  which we can rule out as well .",
    "we conclude that the polynomial @xmath99 is not associated with any pseudo - anosov mapping .",
    "thus , we have the mimimizer  @xmath87 . in order to truly complete the proof",
    ", one needs to explicitly construct the action of this pseudo - anosov mapping on the surface ( see ref .  ) .",
    "@xcite    in the end , is this numerological exercise worth it ?",
    "well , it certainly simplifies the study of pseudo - anosov mappings on surfaces .",
    "in fact , even these abstract surfaces of genus  @xmath78 have practical significance : pseudo - anosov mappings of disks , which can be associated to a stirring device such as that in figure  [ fig : s1s-2s3s-2 ] , can be lifted to surfaces of genus  @xmath78 by a ` branched cover . ' for such applications , the biggest challenge is to develop practical tools ( such as _ train tracks _",
    "@xcite ) that can handle singularities with an _ odd _ number of sectors , which are mathematically more challenging ."
