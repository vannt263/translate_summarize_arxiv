    "radio emission from cosmic ray air showers , initially predicted by askaryan @xcite and experimentally discovered in 1965 by jelley et al .",
    "@xcite , offers the opportunity to carry out cosmic ray and neutrino research with radio measurements in the frequency range from a few to a few hundred mhz .",
    "the radio technique yields data very much complementary to those collected with ground - based particle detector arrays and air shower fluorescence detectors and incorporates the advantages of a 100 % duty cycle , moderate cost per antenna , and the possibility of observation even in populated areas @xcite .    after the flurry of activity in the 1960 s and 1970 s , research in this field virtually ceased completely in the late 1970 s due to experimental problems , difficulties in the interpretation of the experimental data and the success of alternative techniques . with the advent of new fully digital radio interferometers such as lofar and the ideas put forward by falcke & gorham in @xcite , the radio technique ,",
    "however , currently is experiencing its renaissance .",
    "although the effect has been known for almost 40 years , the knowledge of the radio emission properties and their dependence on the underlying air shower parameters has been rather poor until recently ( see , e.g. , the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to address this issue and to build the necessary foundation for the application of radio techniques to cosmic ray research ,",
    "a number of experimental and theoretical efforts have started in the last few years .",
    "on the experimental side , the lopes project @xcite is developing and testing the design of a lofar prototype station for the measurement of cosmic ray air showers .",
    "it will provide experimental data that should finally pin down the absolute strength as well as the polarization properties of the radio emission very soon .",
    "another ongoing effort is the codalema experiment in france @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "there have been calculations presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have developed our own analytical model of the radio emission from vertical cosmic ray air showers in the scheme of coherent geosynchrotron radiation in @xcite .",
    "this model allowed us to gain a solid understanding of the important coherence effects that shape the radio emission .",
    "as a second step in our modeling efforts , we designed and implemented monte carlo simulations of the radio emission from cosmic ray air showers in the same scenario , yet with much higher precision and for arbitrary geometries @xcite .",
    "the simulations are based on analytic parametrizations of the air shower characteristics and constitute a precursor to our upcoming full - fledged monte carlo simulations of radio emission from extensive air showers based on precise air shower modeling with corsika @xcite .    in this article , we present the results inferred so far from the simulations performed with our code .",
    "after a short description of the underlying simulation parameters in section 2 , we describe important characteristics of the radio emission in general such as the radial dependence , the spectral dependence , the curvature of the radio front and the polarization characteristics of the radiation ( which play an important role in experimentally verifying the dominant emission mechanism ) in section 3 .",
    "we analyze the dependence of these characteristics on the associated air shower parameters such as the shower geometry ( zenith and azimuth angle ) , the primary particle energy , the depth of the shower maximum , and the magnetic field in a qualitative way in section 4 .",
    "afterwards , we parametrize the emission s dependence on the various observer and shower parameters in a number of individual formulas for our reference shower ( section 5 ) before generalizing the parametrizations to arbitrary shower geometries and piecing together an overall parametrization incorporating all dependences in section 6 .",
    "we discuss our results in section 7 and conclude the article in section 8 .",
    "all simulations presented here are performed with the monte carlo code described in @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we specify the simulation strategy as well as the parameters and configuration options that are used throughout this work .",
    "obviously , we can not perform a true @xmath0-dimensional analysis of the parameter space in question .",
    "we therefore choose a vertical 10@xmath1  ev air shower as a reference and change only one of the shower parameters at a time to analyze its effect on the radio emission .",
    "this postulates that the effects introduced by changes of the different parameters are well - separable .",
    "we pay special attention in cases where this is obviously not true ( e.g. , primary particle energy and depth of the shower maximum ) .",
    "our reference air shower is calculated with a primary particle energy of @xmath2  ev , developing to its maximum at an atmospheric depth of 631  g  @xmath3 as originally adopted in @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of @xmath4  km above the ground in the case of a vertical air shower .",
    "the following settings are kept throughout all simulations if not explicitly stated otherwise ( definitions of the terms in quotation marks are given in @xcite ) : the particle track lengths are distributed following an exponential probability distribution with mean track length of 36.7  g  @xmath3 for both electrons and positrons .",
    "the particle energies are set to follow a broken power - law distribution peaking at @xmath5 as described in @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is chosen with a strength of 0.5  gauss and an inclination of 70@xmath6 , which approximately corresponds to the configuration present in central europe .",
    "calculations are done on a `` simple grid '' of 1  ns resolution with `` smart trajectory sampling '' enabled .",
    "`` automatic ground - bin inactivation '' is used with a precision goal of 0.25 % in four consecutive blocks of 10000 particles each up to a maximum of 25000000 particles . a total of 800 bins ( 32 in azimuth ; 25 in radius , up to a distance of 1000  m )",
    "is calculated in each simulation .",
    "first , we present the general characteristics of the radio emission from a prototypical 10@xmath1  ev vertical air shower , which we take as the reference shower in this work .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectravertical ] we present the spectral dependence of the emission from a 10@xmath1  ev vertical air shower at various distances from the shower center .",
    "the spectra show a steep decline towards higher frequencies due to the coherence diminishing as the wavelength becomes shorter and thus comparable to the scales present in the shower `` pancake '' .",
    "the field strength reaches a first interference minimum at a distance - dependent frequency .",
    "afterwards , we see a quickly alternating series of maxima and minima that are insufficiently sampled in this calculation and therefore give rise to the unphysical - seeming features at high frequencies .",
    "a realistic modeling of the emission in this incoherent regime would need a more detailed air shower model taking into account the inhomogeneities that are known to be present in the shower cascade .",
    "this can not be achieved with the currently used analytic parametrizations of air shower properties , but will be accomplished once our code is interfaced to the air shower simulation code corsika .",
    "the larger the distance from the shower center , the steeper the spectral dependence of the emission . in other words",
    ", coherence is much better up to large distances at lower frequencies compared with higher frequencies : while the emission is coherent to large distances of @xmath7  m for the 10  mhz frequency component , it already becomes incoherent at @xmath8  m for the 55  mhz frequency component .",
    "figure [ fig : spectraverticalnusnu ] shows the spectra of the same 10@xmath1  ev vertical air shower plotted in a @xmath9 diagram , illustrating that most of the power is emitted at frequencies around 20  mhz to 30  mhz .",
    "these two effects strongly point to low frequencies as the most promising regime for observation of cosmic ray air showers with radio techniques .    to demonstrate the differences for emission at low and high frequencies , we compare some of the results presented in the following sections for the two prototypical frequencies of 10  mhz ( good coherence up to large distances as desirable for experimental measurements ) and 55  mhz ( frequency band used in the historical works and lopes , cf .",

    "[ fig : inclination10mhz ] is explained by the shower s very small angle of only 5@xmath6 to the 70@xmath6 inclined geomagnetic field .",

    "taking into account these effects most likely will redistribute flux in such a way that the emission levels in the center region become smaller , making them more consistent with the historical data .",
    "our analysis of the monte carlo simulation results with regard to the underlying air shower parameters for the first time establishes a number of experimentally relevant features of the radio emission .",
    "one major result is the predicted polarization characteristics of the emission generated in the geomagnetic emission scenario . with this knowledge",
    ", polarization - sensitive experiments should be able to directly verify that a major part of the radio emission indeed stems from the geomagnetic mechanism .",
    "the overall weak intrinsic asymmetries in the emission pattern ( except for those associated with projection effects ) make experimental setups measuring only the total field strength or one circular polarization component seem less desirable .",

    "the intrinsic broadening of the emission pattern associated with the increasing distance of the air shower maximum in combination with projection effects and a flattening of the spectral dependence makes highly inclined air showers an especially interesting target for detection with radio techniques .",
    "other useful results of our simulations are the predicted wavefront curvature , the expected quasi - linear scaling of the field strengths in the coherent regime , the very weak dependence of the total field strength on the specific geomagnetic field geometry and strength , and the changes to the radial dependence as a function of changing depth of shower maximum .",
    "the successful incorporation of a significant number of air shower and observer parameters into a single parametrization as achieved in this work demonstrates that the emission is overall `` well - behaved '' and yields a well - interpretable signal . as a solid estimate",
    ", the parametrization can be a useful tool for the interpretation of experimental data and the planning of experimental setups .",
    "additionally , there are remarkable similarities between the parametrization of our monte carlo results and the historic allan - formula , although significant uncertainty regarding the absolute calibration of the historical data remains .",

    ", we will switch from analytic parametrizations of air shower characteristics as the basis of our simulations to a full - fledged air shower model based on the corsika simulation code , further improving the modeling accuracy .",
    "the two main drawbacks of the current model , an over - simplified particle pitch - angle distribution and the disregard of inhomogeneities in the air shower development , will then automatically be resolved .",
    "this work presents the cumulative result of our effort at a realistic modeling of the radio emission from cosmic ray air showers in the scheme of coherent geosynchrotron radiation . for the first time",
