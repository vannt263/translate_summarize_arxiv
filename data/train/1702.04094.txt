    "in this section we will introduce in the context of black holes and the hps proposal a possible novel aspect on the properties soft photon fields discussing a particular aspect of real photons , namely the spatial information of light associated to its orbital angular momentum .",
    "when currents generating structured em fields and real photons carrying well - defined values of oam , fall into a bh and produce supertranslation states and different spacetimes according to the arbitrary combination of higher spherical harmonics so far generated , we expect to find local spatial structures also in the soft photon hair implant .    electromagnetic fields ,",
    "but for few exceptions , like a single classical plane wave , transport angular momentum .",
    "in fact , differently from plane waves , which carry linear momentum with no azimuthal component , vortex beams can have nonzero total azimuthal momentum @xmath30 but an identically zero azimuthal component of linear momentum @xcite .    these fields , generated in a finite ( source ) volume @xmath31 containing an arbitrary distribution of electric ( magnetic ) charge and current densities @xmath32 and @xmath33 are those associated to real photons .",
    "superpositions of multipolar sources , generated by currents involving electric charged particles , generate em fields that carry precise values of orbital angular momentum @xcite .    the conserved quantity em angular momentum * j * is known to generate fields with well  defined spatial structures of intensity and phase .",
    "the total angular momentum * j * of a particle can be decomposed in spin angular momentum ( sam ) , * s * , and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , * l*. whilst the splitting of the total angular momentum in two observables , @xmath34 , is valid for massive particles , it has not always a precise physical meaning for the photon ; in any case sam and oam are auxiliary concepts that describe the photon wavefunction properties with respect to rotations and oam @xmath35 gives the order of the spherical functions involved in the radiation field together with the parity of the photon state , following precise rules for the composition of l and s from the classical field formulation down to the single photon level , where intensity corresponds to the probability of generating a photon in a specific region of spacetime with precise properties @xcite .",
    " oam is currently being widely applied in modern physics and technology such as quantum and classical communications @xcite , astrophysics @xcite , nanotechnology and many other research fields @xcite .",
    "the most known example of fields carrying precise sam and oam states are those described by laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) beams , also known as lg modes .",
    "their importance is that they provide an orthogonal fundamental basis to expand and describe any oam field .",
    "these are cylindrically symmetric structured em beams that carry @xmath36 oam per photon relative to its symmetry axis with em field amplitude of a lg beam is in cylindrical coordinates @xmath37 @xmath38}^l    \\\\ & & l_m^l \\left[\\frac{2 r^2}{w^2(z)}\\right ] \\exp \\left[\\frac{-r^2}{w(z)^2}\\right ] \\exp \\left[\\frac{-\\mathrm{i } k r^{2}}{2r(z)}\\right ] \\nonumber   \\\\ & & \\exp \\left[-\\mathrm{i } ( 2 m + l + 1 ) \\arctan \\left(\\frac{z}{z_r}\\right)\\right ] e^{-\\mathrm{i } l \\varphi } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the rayleigh range of the beam , @xmath40 the beam waist , @xmath41 an associated laguerre polynomial and @xmath42 the radius of curvature .",
    "the azimuthal and radial indices @xmath35 and @xmath43 describe the oam of the beam and the number of radial nodes of the associated intensity profile , respectively @xcite .",
    "any generic field @xmath44 can be expressed in terms of multipolar fields expanded in spherical harmonics @xcite , @xmath45 and the multipolar content can be expressed in terms of paraxial fields , with properties that remain valid down to the single photon level .",
    "thus , also the em fields carrying oam and the so - called vortex beams that usually are written as superpositions of lg modes can be expanded in spherical harmonics as superpositions of multipolar fields that depend only on the wavelength .",
    "a simple lg beam with @xmath46 has vector potential @xmath47 that , in terms of multipolar superpositions of circularly polarized plane waves becomes , @xmath48 \\label{potentiala}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 where the vector potential @xmath50 is decomposed in the magnetic @xmath51 and electric @xmath52 terms , @xmath53 is the wavenumber , @xmath54 the waist of the associated gaussian beam and @xmath55 is the associated laguerre polynomial .",
    "we note that the field is composed of multipolar solutions with different total angular momentum , but with the same projection of the angular momentum in the direction @xmath56 , which is @xmath57 or @xmath58 depending on the polarization of the field and @xmath59 , @xmath60 represents the circular polarization operator and @xmath53 the wavevector .",
    "fields with oam @xmath35 and polarization @xmath60 such as lg fields are decomposed into multipolar modes with a fixed component @xmath61 along @xmath56 of the angular momentum @xcite .",
    "suitable superpositions of charged currents @xmath62 can generate multipolar spatially structured em fields carrying oam and vorticity that are characterized by precise phase structures in space @xcite .",
    "recalling ref .",
    "@xcite , let us consider such a set of falling currents on a static bh , as in eq .",
    "[ metricbh ] .",
    "we find numerically and from simple analytic considerations , that these charged currents induce spatial structures also on the soft photon field in a neighborhood of the bh event horizon .    in the numerical simulations , for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we consider a distribution of dipolar currents in a set of azimuthally - dephased radiating dipoles on a circle with radius @xmath63 and center @xmath64 that produce a radiating em field with a well - defined oam value @xmath35 .",
    "the circle is orthogonal to the direction @xmath65 connecting @xmath66 and the center of the bh .",
    "we calculate the spatial distribution of the soft photon implant on the event horizon of the bh from eqs .",
    "[ inject ] and [ frad ] in a neighborhood of the point @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that the bh radius , @xmath68 , is @xmath69 and approximate the metrics near the horizon @xmath70 in a small angular region @xmath71 , where a small neighborhood of an observer can be described in first approximation as a rindler coordinate system and a set of observers on the direction @xmath72 identify , at a first approximation , a class of rindler observers . for these observers and with the approximations here",
    "adopted , the radiating field from the currents is not significantly affected by the free - fall radiating process @xcite that we neglect in first approximation .",
    "more in detail , in the numerical simulations , we considered the formation of a soft photon hair implant from four falling dipolar currents with linear polarization across the @xmath73axis of the new accelerated local frame @xmath74 that generate an @xmath75 em vortex of real photons .",
    "the four dipoles , distributed around a circle with radius @xmath76 have a spatial extension much smaller than the wavelength emitted , @xmath77 and are azimuthally dephased of @xmath78 to generate an em field with @xmath75 oam value calculated with respect to the center of symmetry of the dipole array .",
    "the point of observation is located at @xmath79 wavelengths distance in the direction @xmath65 .",
    "we calculate each photon hair implant and draw the `` intensity '' , which has the meaning of probability of implanting / detecting a soft photon in a specific point of the spacetime and phase profile in the neighborhood of the event horizon where the field has not null intensity yet , neglecting the backreaction of the shell and of the em field on the geometry .",
    "all numerical simulations were performed with matlab and nec ( numerical electromagnetics code ) @xcite that morphed the standard nec input and output into the correct shape of the static spacetime geometry here considered through a geometrical optics transformation derived from analog gravity @xcite .",
    "figure 1 displays the probability of emission of a photon in a superposition of oam states and the spatial phase distribution of the em field generated by the four dipolar currents for an observer located on the radial axis with direction @xmath65 at a distance @xmath80 in a window of @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding probability of associating a soft photon state to any point in that window is numerically calculated directly from the distribution of the multipolar radiation fields .",

    "right : the soft photon field induced by the currents shows a spiral spectrum peaked on a dominant term that is larger of one unity with respect to the real photon field , namely , @xmath84.,width=302 ]    owing to the realistic simulation of the four dipoles , the spiral spectrum of the electric field component along @xmath85 generated by the dipoles clearly shows a complex structure of oam components where the dominant term is @xmath75 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , where are reported the spiral spectra @xcite of the em field emitted by the dipoles and that of the soft photon field induced by them .",
    "the spiral spectrum shows the distribution of oam modes that build up the spatial phase information of the field .",
    "interestingly , the numerical results show that the spatial information of the em field generated by the four falling dipoles described by the spiral spectrum peaked at the @xmath86 oam value , is similar to that of the soft photon hair implant on the bh horizon but for a translation and small modifications , showing a dominant @xmath87 oam mode .",
    "naively , this effect of spiral spectrum shift finds an interesting parallelism with the optical experiments involving oam beams : the soft photon hair implant @xmath88 behaves as if it were the product of the initial radiation field of the current @xmath62 after crossing a single - bifurcation fork hologram that shifts the spiral spectrum of one oam unit @xcite .",
    "because of this , the `` hologram '' engraved on the event horizon @xcite acquires this spatial structure described by the spiral spectrum of the distribution of the soft photon field implants , involving larger and larger pixel sets on the horizon with the increase of the complexity of the fields as the oam value increases .    from an analytic point of view",
    ", the shift of the spiral spectrum can be explained as follows .",
    "consider a set of charges that radiate an em field described by a single ideal lg mode with topological charge @xmath35 as in eq .",
    "[ eqn : lgmode ] .",
    "this carries a finite value of polarization and oam , with a precise spatial structure in intensity and phase .",

    "[ frad ] and the derivation rules in the riemann sphere @xcite , after some algebra , being @xmath92 where @xmath35 and @xmath53 are two arbitrary indexes , it is clear that the resulting soft photon field presents terms with increased oam value of exactly one unit , @xmath93 , with respect to the spherical harmonic distribution of the field emitted by the charges of eqs .",
    "[ potentiala ] and [ gaussian ] , confirming our numerical findings in the spiral spectra .",
    "all information regarding the spatial distribution of currents seems to be encoded on the event horizon and written in the modified metric of eq .",
    "[ newmetric ] . in this way we provide a novel physical interpretation to the _ lush head _ of `` soft hair '' of bhs , showing their still hidden potentialities of having not only a modified spacetime but also an organized spatial structure on the event horizon with well  defined oam states",
    "there encoded .",
    "bh soft photon hair implants seem to inherit similar local spatial properties of the `` regular '' photons emitted by the currents .    * conclusions . * following hps , black holes encode the spatial information of infalling currents generating oam beams in twisted hair implants that present a local a spatial structure on the event horizon . all information is encoded in the new spacetime transformed by supertranslation fields .",
    "we can also use the symmetries of em fields to locally spatially structure these implants and encode structured and densely organized information on the event horizon through suitable coherent superpositions of spin and angular momentum states of soft photons .",
    "thus , bhs can have `` curly '' , twisted , structured soft  hair implants where information can be written onto the horizon in an organized way .",
    "this procedure can be extended to more complex field configurations expressed in terms of conserved quantities and symmetries inducing additional supertranslation fields .",
    "interestingly , a coherent and organized superposition of such quantum states might correspond to an organized string of quantum bits of information encoded into the event horizon as in an holographic projection as soft hair has a natural description as quantum pixels in a holographic plate .",
    "multi - dimensional strings of qbits carrying ordered and structured information can excite pixels in an ordered way , creating structures on the event horizon can be built from the invariants and symmetries of the gravitational and em fields , in a sort of quantum alphabet .",
    "this might represent a novel way to input controlled information on bhs that will evolve according to their computational complexity .",
    "complexity can be encoded through a coherent @xcite superposition and combination of states as a string of a quantum computer @xcite where , possibly , a non - thermal spectrum characterizes the passage from macroscopic to microscopic information .",
    "this information is thought to be processed by the bh interior as in a quantum computer obeying the rules of quantum computation and complexity ; bhs are supposed to be the fastest computers to process complexity in the most optimal way @xcite , encoding information in the structure of spacetime modifying it with the supertranslation fields , with the already discussed observational effects .",
    "any bh would resemble a quantum computer with high coherence and this information encoded so far could be located by the soft  hair implant in a neighborhood of the event horizon and in the modified spacetime . in any case , also by using a quantum field theory approach , because of shaw theorem that connects information and volume in the phases , any physical system must belong to one of these three classes : systems that preserve information , information dissipating systems and polynomial / exponential information amplifiers @xcite and for bhs this seems to be still an open debate .",
