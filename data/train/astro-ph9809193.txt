    "the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ) is the nearest milky way satellite .",
    "the detailed study of this stellar system can potentially provide important insights on topics ranging from evolution of dwarf galaxy to the formation of the milky way halo ( see ibata et al 1997 and bellazzini , ferraro & buonanno 1998 , for details and references ) .    despite of its relative nearness sgr represents a noticeable challenge from an observational point of view because of",
    "its very low surface brightness ( one needs to sample wide fields to adequately populate the brightest part of the color magnitude diagram ) and of the strong contamination by foreground stars from the milky way bulge and disk ( statistical decontamination of color magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) is necessary ) .    in the attempt of overcoming both problems we planned a large photometric survey of the galaxy .",
    "three large ( @xmath3 ) fields placed in different regions of sgr dsph have been observed in v and i passband .",
    "calibrated photometry has been obtained for nearly 90000 stars in these fields .",
    "addictional @xmath4 stars have been observed in a control field devoid of sgr stars , for statistical decontamination purposes .",
    "observations have been carried out at the eso - ntt and data has been reduced with the romafot package .    in table 1",
    "the main characteristics of the observed fields are reported .",
    "the best photometric quality has been achieved for the sgr34 and sgrwest fields .",
    "the limiting magnitude for these fields is around @xmath5 while in the case of the sgr12 and gal fields it is some 1 mag brighter .",
    "the gal field samples the foreground population at the same galactic latitude of sgr12 but outside the body of the sgr dsph .",
    "a deeper ( v , i ) photometry of the gal region has been obtained by muskkk and has been adopted as final control field sample for decontamination of the faintest part of our cmds .",
    ".names and positions of sdgs fields .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a deep analysis of the obtained cmds has been performed before attempting statistical decontamination and a first paper dealing with distance , reddening , degree of foreground contamination in the various fields and many other topics has been submitted to mnras ( bellazzini , ferraro & buonanno 1998 , hereafter pap - i ) . for the present purposes it is useful to recall two of the results of pap - i , i.e. ( 1 ) the reddening differences between the various sdgs fields are tiny and ( 2 ) there are evidences for the presence of a population as metal poor as @xmath6=-2.0 $ ] associated with the sgr dsph .    here",
    "we just present preliminary results from the analysis of the statistically decontaminated cmds of the sgr34 and sgr12 fields , providing some constraint on the age and metallicity distribution of sgr stars and proposing a general scheme for the star formation history in this galaxy .",
    "comparing the rgb stars distribution ( from decontaminated cmds ) with ridge lines from template globular clusters it is concluded that the stars belonging to the main population of the sgr dsph span a wide metallicity range ( more than 1 dex ) , from @xmath6\\sim-2.0 $ ] to @xmath6=-0.7 $ ] , the bulk of the stars having @xmath7<-0.7 $ ] .",
    "few stars more metal rich than @xmath6=-0.7 $ ] are probably present in the sgr12 field , confirming previous claims of a small metallicity gradient toward the sgr center of density ( sarajedini & layden 1995 ; marconi et al 1997 ) .",
    "the decontaminated cmd of the sgr34 field is shown in fig .",
    "1 [ panel ( a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "the obvious `` globular cluster -like '' features are typically associated with an intermediate - old main population ( muskkk , marconi et al 1997 ) .",
    "hereafter we will refer to this component as sgr pop a. the sparse blue plume of stars around @xmath8 and @xmath9 is usually interpreted as an extended main sequence associated with more recent star formation episodes ( hereafter , sgr pop b ) .",
    "till now , the standard way to deal with the age of sgr pop a was to assign an average metallicity to the population and then deriving an age via isochrone fitting of the to region .",
    "the present day data are consistent with a single to point ( or , at least , with few slightly different and unresolved to points superposed in the same cmd region ) .",
    "stellar evolution teach us that populations of different metallicity can share a common to point only if they differ also in age , in the sense that more metal rich populations have to be younger ( i.e. , the usual sense of any well - behaved age - metallicity relation ) .",
    "we propose this kind of solution for the sfh of sgr pop a as the most likely from many point of view ( see bellazzini , ferraro & buonanno 1999 ) .",
    "this is the first attempt to provide a global fit to both the to region and the spreaded rgb of the sgr cmd .    in panel",
    "( a ) of fig .",
    "1 the ridge lines of 47 tuc ( from kaluzny et al 1998 ; continuous line ) and of pal 1 ( from rosenberg et al 1998a ; dashed line ) are superposed to the observed cmd .",
    "the two clusters have the same metallicity ( [ fe / h]=-0.7 ; rosenberg et al 1998b ) but pal 1 is younger than 47 tuc by @xmath10 . while the ridge line of 47 tuc clearly do not fit the to region of sgr an excellent fit",
    "is provided by pal 1 . at present , this is the best fit to the whole sgr cmd based on empirical ( v , v - i ) ridge lines .",
    "it is concluded that the more metal rich stars in sgr34 are significantly younger than 47 tuc and have nearly the same age of pal 1 .",
    "however the ridge line of pal 1 ca nt provide , obviously , a satisfying fit of the spreaded rgb of the sgr galaxy , a more metal poor component is also needed .",
    "the continuous line reported in panel ( b ) is the ridge line of the m 3 globular cluster ( a classical old globular with [ fe / h]=-1.3 ; ferraro et al .",
    "1997 ) , while the dashed line is ( again ) the pal 1 ridge line .",
    "the m 3 ridge line is not unconsistent with the observed cmd in the to region and provides a good fit for a number of sgr rgb stars .",
    "coupling the two ridge lines a ( qualitative ) simultaneous fit of all the observed characteristics of the cmd of pop a is provided=-2.0 ; not shown here ) is also consistent with the observed to and fits the bluest rgb stars in the sgr34 color magnitude diagram ] . the comparisons shown in fig .",
    "1 strongly suggest that a spread in age is coupled with the observed metallicity spread .",
    "the same scheme can be checked through comparison with theoretical isochrones , as shown in fig .",
    "the dashed lines superposed to the cmd of the sgr34 field are isochrones of ( [ fe / h]=-1.3 ; age=12 gyr ) and ( [ fe / h]=-0.7 ; age=8 gyr ) respectively ( see caption ) .",
    "coupling the two , a consistent solution can be found fitting both the to region and the spreaded rgb . adding a ( [ fe / h]=-2.0 ; age=16 gyr )",
    "would complete the scheme , providing a satisfying interpretation for all the properties of pop a : a long lasting old ( age @xmath11 8 gyr ) star formation event accompanied by progressive chemical enrichment .",
    "this star formation history scheme is also supported by the age metallicity relation derived by montegriffo et al ( 1998 ) for the globular cluster system of the sgr galaxy .",
    "a clear - cut confirmation of the proposed scheme is not possible at the moment , given the accuracy of the sdgs data at the to level . however hst photometry ( mighell at al .",
    "1997 ) will certainly allow a much more accurate analysis of the to region , checking the present hypothesis and providing more details to the scenario .",
    "the blue plume stars are nicely bracketed between a 1 gyr isochrone and a 4 gyr isochrones , both at [ fe / h]=-0.7 .",
    "the adoption of higher metallicity isochrones would have the only effect of shifting the age range of pop b to younger ages .",
    "it is concluded that , massive star formation in sgr suddenly stopped several gyrs ago ( pop a ) , while more marginal episodes lasted until recent times ( pop b provides less than @xmath12 of the whole sgr dsph stellar content ; pap - i ) .",
    "the proposed scheme can be applied to all the observed regions of the galaxy , since the stellar content is found to be remarkably homogeneous over the whole sampled scale ( @xmath13 kpc along the major axis ) .",
