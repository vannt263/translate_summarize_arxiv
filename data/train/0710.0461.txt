    "the correct form of the energy  momentum tensor of an electromagnetic wave , and hence the momentum of an electromagnetic wave in a dielectric medium , has been debated for almost a century .",
    "two different forms of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor were originally proposed by @xcite and @xcite , though more have been added in later years @xcite .",
    "the question regularly attracts experimental interest , as on initial inspection it may appear that some of the different tensors give rise to distinct and potentially useful physical consequences .",
    "we discuss why this is not the case , reviewing the key experiments of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and theoretical work including that of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the latter four authors demonstrating explicitly and directly the equivalence of a number of different energy  momentum tensors .",
    "more recent work on the subject may largely be divided into three camps .",
    "first , there are those concerned with practical applications , focussing primarily on which expression is most useful in a given circumstance .",
    "second , there are those extending the theoretical work into new domains",
    ". frequently such papers are hampered by the fragmentary nature of existing literature on the topic and their conclusions may be weakened as a result .",
    "third , there are those who are unconvinced that the controversy has been resolved , perhaps unsurprising as certain key publications remain relatively obscure .",
    "it is clear that broad interest still exists in the subject , and from the widespread prevalence of work in the second and third categories , that the field stands to benefit greatly from a coherent and comprehensive review .",
    "we therefore hope this paper will increase awareness that the controversy has been resolved , and that predictions regarding measurable behaviours will always be independent of the electromagnetic energy ",
    "momentum tensor chosen , provided the accompanying material tensor is also taken into account .",
    "in particular , renewed interest in the controversy has been stimulated by the advent of optical trapping and manipulation of microparticles in fluid media @xcite .",
    "we wish to lay to rest any concerns that predictions of observable effects in optical tweezers might depend on the division of momentum between field and medium , and to provide an introduction to the subject of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor in a dielectric medium .",
    "we hope that by reading this paper and some of its references , those new to the field will gain a comprehensive understanding of this interesting subject .",
    "the abraham  minkowski controversy debates the correct expression for electromagnetic momentum within a material medium , and by implication the form of the four - dimensional energy  momentum tensor .",
    "before we debate the relative merits of the different expressions , we must first satisfy ourselves that it is possible to construct a well - defined energy  momentum tensor .",
    "after all , on a microscopic level the transfer of energy and momentum consists of the absorption and emission of photons as they interact with the atoms of the medium , a process which is both stochastic and quantum - mechanical in nature .    fortunately , the abraham ",
    "minkowski controversy is conventionally formulated wholly within the realms of classical continuum electrodynamics @xcite , in which the fluctuations due to the inherent unpredictability of the microscopic realm become negligible .",
    "specifically , the properties of the medium must change negligibly over unit cells which are nevertheless large in comparison with the mean volume per atom .",
    "discontinuous inter - medium boundaries are permitted provided they are sharp on the scale of these unit cells . the transition from stochastic behaviour on the microscopic scale to the maxwell equations of the continuum , and hence by implication a domain in which both the refractive index and the energy  momentum tensor are well - defined and piecewise smooth is comprehensively detailed by @xcite .",
    "a number of authors do extend the problem into the microscopic domain @xcite .",
    "such work must of course be evaluated on its own merits , and on its consistency with the results of experiment @xcite .",
    "the first author to propose an expression for the energy  momentum tensor of an electromagnetic wave in a dielectric medium was @xcite .",
    "his expression corresponds to an electromagnetic wave momentum density of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electric displacement field and @xmath2 is the magnetic flux density .",
    "the total momentum of a propagating electromagnetic wave therefore increases upon entering a dielectric medium , from @xmath3 in free space , to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the refractive index of the medium , and we are neglecting dispersion .",
    "an accessible derivation of the minkowski energy ",
    "momentum tensor may be found in @xcite . the electromagnetic energy ",
    "momentum tensor of minkowski was not diagonally symmetric , and this drew considerable criticism as it was held to be incompatible with the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "@xcite therefore developed an alternative , symmetric , tensor , for which the electromagnetic wave momentum density was instead @xmath6 , with @xmath7 representing the electric field and @xmath8 the magnetic field .",
    "the momentum of an electromagnetic wave entering a dielectric medium then falls to @xmath9 . under the abraham tensor",
    ", a photon therefore carries less momentum within a medium than in the minkowski case .",
    "however , both of these tensors are incomplete in isolation @xcite . momentum may also be carried by interactions occurring within the material medium , and between the medium and the electromagnetic field .",
    "this is most obvious for the abraham tensor , as the material tensor must be considered in order to obtain the correct rate of transfer of momentum to a reflective object suspended within a dielectric medium , as in the experiments of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , increasing the photon momentum from @xmath3 to @xmath4 in accordance with the minkowski tensor yields the correct result directly , and hence many authors neglect to observe that it , too , is associated with a corresponding material tensor .",
    "any complete , thermodynamically closed system must conserve energy and momentum , and it is only by taking into account the corresponding material tensor that the minkowski formulation can be reconciled with conservation of total angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of a transparent object is less straightforward , with the object acquiring a fixed velocity away from the source while exposed to the electromagnetic field .",
    "the existing literature lacks a single consistent mathematical approach capable of dealing with wholly or partially reflective and transparent objects immersed within a dielectric medium .",
    "we address this lack in sec .",

    "when the force exerted by an electromagnetic wave in a dielectric medium is evaluated without recourse to the material counterpart of the minkowski tensor , then the two tensors will predict different results .",
    "the force density predicted by the abraham tensor pair is smaller by @xmath10 which is known historically as the abraham force . here",
    ", @xmath11 is the real instantaneous poynting vector @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the relative permittivity and permeability of the medium respectively . when the material counterpart to the minkowski electromagnetic energy ",

    "momentum tensor was not fully appreciated , and vigorous debate ensued regarding the relative merits of the abraham and minkowski electromagnetic energy  momentum tensors .",
    "we shall discuss more fully how the requirement for the material counterpart to the minkowski tensor arises from conservation of total linear and angular momentum in sec .",
    "[ proofsequiv ] .",
    "meanwhile , it is worth noting that in some sense `` the momentum of a photon in a dielectric medium '' is an abstract concept , as it is impossible to construct an experiment to directly measure this momentum .",
    "instead , one can only measure the total energy or momentum transferred to a detecting apparatus in a given set of circumstances .",
    "this may include contributions both from the electromagnetic momentum and from the associated material energy ",
    "momentum tensor .",
    "one may therefore ask whether it is possible or not to devise an experiment which distinguishes between the abraham and the minkowski tensors .",
    "the first experiment to measure the radiation pressure due to light in a refracting medium was conducted by @xcite at the university of aberdeen .",
    "jones sought to verify the prediction that when a mirror was immersed in a dielectric medium , the radiation pressure exerted on the mirror would be proportional to the refractive index of the medium .",

    "was subjected to an asymmetric illumination , giving rise to a torque about the axis of suspension and causing both lower ( _ v _ ) and upper ( _ m _ ) mirrors to rotate until this torque was neutralised by the torsion fibre . by measuring the angle of the upper mirror ,",
    "the authors determined the magnitude of the torque , and hence the rate of momentum transfer to the lower mirror . by immersing the lower mirror in a number of liquids of varying refractive index and observing the resultant deflections , the momentum transferred",
    "was found to scale with the refractive index , and the accuracy obtained was sufficient to show that this dependency was upon the phase refractive index ( @xmath17 ) , and not the group refractive index ( @xmath18 ) of the medium .",
    "this finding agreed with theoretical expectations , as the behaviour examined was concerned with variations in the electric field at a point , rather than the rate of propagation through the medium of a modulation in the field .    in the theoretical introduction to the 1954 paper , jones discussed whether the choice of expression for the momentum density of the electromagnetic wave was dependent either upon @xmath0 or @xmath12 , though without direct reference to the work of minkowski or abraham .",
    "he observed that the former followed naturally from the expression for the maxwellian stresses on a body within a radiation field , whereas the latter could be suggested on relativistic grounds ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but was also accompanied by a corresponding stress in the surrounding medium of @xmath19 ( in gaussian units ) , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 stand for the dielectric constant and magnetic permeability of the medium respectively , and the expression is equivalent to the abraham term ( [ eq : abrterm ] ) .",
    "he commented that `` it does not seem possible to devise a practicable experiment to distinguish between the two cases '' .",
    "@xcite subsequently argued that when the linear momentum flux densities due to the abraham electromagnetic tensor and the corresponding material stress tensor are combined , the result is the same as that given by the minkowski tensor .",
    "he thus interpreted the experiment of jones and richards as providing more direct support for the minkowski formulation .",

    "the next significant experiment conducted was that of @xcite , in response to a theoretical paper by @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "burt and peierls argued that when a laser beam passed from air into a dielectric fluid of greater refractive index , transfer of momentum to the fluid would cause the surface to either bulge outwards , if the minkowski tensor was correct , or be depressed , if the abraham tensor was correct .",
    "however , this conclusion was based on the mistaken assumption that the momentum of the electromagnetic wave would rapidly move ahead of any momentum associated with the material medium , allowing them to neglect the effects of the material tensor in the abraham case . in fact , the field - related material component of the momentum constitutes an excitation induced in the medium by the leading edge of the electromagnetic wave and eliminated by the trailing edge .",
    "the excitation of the material medium therefore propagates at the same velocity as the electromagnetic wave .",

    "in their paper they acknowledged work by @xcite , at that time still unpublished , which showed that this result does not invalidate the abraham tensor , as the predictions of the two tensors are reconciled when the material counterpart to the abraham tensor is properly taken into account .      in 1968",
    "james performed an experiment to directly measure the abraham force @xcite .",
    "two ferrite toroids , axially aligned with one another , were connected to a piezo - electric transducer .",
    "the toroids were subjected to time - varying electric and magnetic fields . both minkowski s and abraham s energy ",
    "momentum tensors predicted a net torque on the toroids , but with differing magnitudes due to the existence of the abraham term , eq .",
    "( [ eq : abrterm ] ) . with the varying electric fields arranged in antiphase , the two toroids exerted torques in opposite directions upon the piezo - electric transducer , and by measuring the magnitude of this torque",
    ", james was able to experimentally demonstrate the existence of the abraham force .",
    "this result went largely unnoticed until the experiment of @xcite .",
    "this team measured the torque exerted on a disc of barium titanate which was suspended on a torsion fibre in a constant axial magnetic field , and subjected to a time - varying radial electric field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : walkerexpt ] ) .    ]",
    "the disc behaved as a torsion pendulum and its period of oscillation was measured by reflecting a laser beam off a mirror attached to the disc .",
    "to maximise the response of the system , the time period of the electric field was synchronised with the oscillations of the disc . following an initial displacement , the oscillations of the disc settled exponentially towards a constant period , supporting the existence of the abraham force .",
    "the experiment was also later modified to confirm the effects of a time - varying magnetic field @xcite .",
    "as the conservation arguments leading to demonstration of the material counterpart of the minkowski tensor were not widely recognised at this time , this experiment was taken as providing support for the abraham tensor over that of minkowski @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and later , tangentially , @xcite have demonstrated that for a suitable combination of electromagnetic and material energy ",
    "momentum tensors the observed results are also compatible with the minkowski case , and hence these experiments can not discriminate between the two .      in 1977",
    ", jones and leslie repeated the experiment of 1954 , taking advantage of recent advances in technology .",
    "a laser was employed as a light source instead of a tungsten lamp , allowing the refractive index of the liquid to be stated with greater precision as only one wavelength of light was involved ; a superior mirror was employed , reducing heating of the dielectric liquids and hence convection forces in the fluid ; and the torsion apparatus was restored to the neutral position by means of an external electromagnet .",
    "the current in this electromagnet related to the radiation pressure in a highly linear manner , whereas in the previous apparatus , the authors estimate that nonlinearity in the measured deflection of the secondary mirror may have been as large as @xmath22 .    through these modifications to the experiment , jones and leslie obtained final results with a standard deviation of only @xmath23 @xcite . in the accompanying theoretical paper @xcite , jones discussed whether this corresponded to a photon momentum of @xmath24 in accordance with the minkowski tensor , or @xmath25 in accordance with the abraham tensor ( where @xmath3 is the momentum of the photon in free space , and @xmath17 and @xmath26 are respectively the phase and group refractive indices ) . once again , he concluded that both were acceptable provided that in the abraham case the total momentum @xmath24 was divided into an electromagnetic component @xmath27 , and a mechanical component , which was expressed this time as @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "numerous attempts have been made to find additional constraints by which one or another of the abraham and minkowski energy momentum tensors might be proven invalid , the earliest being the suggestion that the minkowski tensor failed to conserve angular momentum .",
    "this led first @xcite and then @xcite to attempt to develop symmetric forms of the electromagnetic energy  momentum tensor .",
    "the einstein ",
    "laub tensor enjoyed only limited attention as it does not purport to be valid outside the rest frame of the dielectric medium .",
    "its use  indeed , even its validity  in a science increasingly embracing the principle of relativity was therefore considered questionable .",
    "it attracted considerably less interest than abraham s form , which was developed in a fully relativistic manner , working from microscopic considerations .",
    "in contrast , @xcite claimed to demonstrate the derivation of the minkowski tensor from microscopic considerations .",
    "however , according to @xcite he fails to justify his generalisation from the electrostatic to the dynamic case , and @xcite also deemed his argument `` not very cogent '' .    as we noted in sec .",
    "[ earlyyears ] , concerns about non - conservation of angular momentum in the minkowski electromagnetic energy  momentum tensor arose from consideration of an incomplete system . when the appropriate material tensor is also taken into account , angular momentum is conserved ( sec .",
    "[ proofsequiv ] ) .",
    "similarly the einstein ",
    "laub tensor can be saved from the ignonimy of depending upon a specific frame of reference .",
    "later , @xcite argued that the velocity of energy propagation , which is less than @xmath29 in a dielectric medium , should add in accordance with the relativistic velocity addition theorem .",
    "an equivalent argument , developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and 221 - 225 respectively ) , is that the energy propagation velocity should transform as a 4-vector .",
    "this is satisfied by the electromagnetic energy flux under the minkowski tensor , but not under the abraham tensor . in the first edition of his work mller concludes ``  this is a strong argument in favour of minkowski s theory '' , but in the second edition this is softened to ``  which shows that minkowski s theory gives the most convenient description of the phenomenon in question '' .",
    "this alteration perhaps reflects a change in philosophy , away from attempting to prove that one tensor is wrong and the other is right , and towards recognising that both have their place in a practical implementation of electrodynamics .",
    "although it was ultimately dismissed by @xcite and @xcite , von laue s argument was nevertheless influential .",
    "when pauli first wrote his encyclopedia article on relativity @xcite , he favoured the abraham tensor .",
    "however , in the revised edition @xcite , he inserted a supplementary note reversing his position on account of von laue s argument .",
    "in addition to rebutting the arguments of von laue and mller , skobeltsyn also proposed criteria of his own based on two thought experiments , which favoured the abraham tensor .",
    "these are described in detail by @xcite , along with his reasons for rejecting skobeltsyn s arguments .",
    "brevik then concludes that the second thought experiment , which deals with a capacitor free to rotate within a magnetic field , would nevertheless provide an experimental means to discriminate between the abraham and minkowski tensors .",
    "the behaviour of the experiment depends upon the existence or otherwise of the abraham force , as does the experiment of @xcite .",
    "the rebuttals of @xcite and @xcite discussed in sec .  [ expts : walker ] are equally applicable to skobeltsyn s second experiment , and hence both skobeltsyn s arguments and brevik s interpretation of the second experiment are refuted .",
    "@xcite also published an argument against the minkowski tensor based on non - conservation of angular momentum , similar to skobeltsyn s second argument .",
    "this was rebutted by @xcite by invoking the material counterpart to the minkowski electromagnetic tensor .",
    "we raise this here to discuss lai s counter - argument @xcite . in this",
    ", he argues that his thought experiment was not intended to distinguish between what he calls the `` phenomenological '' theories derived from global conservation of momentum , but rather to determine which of abraham s and minkowski s tensors is `` physically correct '' . how this is to be interpreted is unclear .",
    "if lai is advocating comparison of the historical forms of these tensors , then as neither incorporates effects such as electrostriction and magnetostriction , both are incomplete and demonstrably incorrect .",
    "we can only ask which is least inaccurate in any particular situation , a conclusion of little general value .    if lai permits the material tensor accompanying the abraham tensor to be amended to incorporate such effects , but does not permit the minkowski tensor to receive the same treatment , then he is crippling one of the contenders before the competition , and to conclude that one then performs better than the other is hardly surprising .",
    "finally , if both tensors are allowed such a counterpart , then we recover the treatment of brevik , which lai dismisses as `` phenomenological '' and missing the point .",
    "alternatively , lai may be implying that it is possible to discriminate between the minkowski and abraham tensors when both are accompanied by the appropriate material tensors .",
    "this position , however , has been disproven by others @xcite , and hence lai s thought experiment appears to serve no useful purpose , in spite of his defence .",
    "it is of historical note that the abraham tensor was also initially proposed without a material counterpart @xcite , and it was several decades before the role of this counterpart in determining experimental results was properly appreciated ( see sec .",
    "[ expts : ashkin ] ) .",
    "any treatment involving such a material counterpart is to some extent phenomenological , with the nature of the counterpart being determined or verified by observable fact @xcite .",
    "it can be argued that only approaches which begin from universal conservation laws may be exempt from this criticism , if criticism it is , but it is these very results which lai appears to dismiss out of hand .",
    "other arguments purportedly favouring one tensor or the other had also been proposed @xcite , but ultimately it was not to be these which decided the debate . in the 1960s and 1970s , two developments occurred which changed the face of the argument completely .",
    "first , a number of further alternative energy ",
    "momentum tensors were proposed on various theoretical grounds @xcite .",
    "the debate was no longer over whether to choose abraham s or minkowski s formulation , but rather over the principles upon which a valid electromagnetic energy  momentum tensor should be based .",
    "second , @xcite identified the abraham electromagnetic energy ",
    "momentum tensor with classical momentum and the minkowski tensor with crystal momentum , or pseudomomentum .",
    "although the work was unpublished it had considerable effect , stimulating a recognition that both energy  momentum tensors might have a valid role in appropriate circumstances .",
    "although not every proposed means of discriminating between the abraham and minkowski tensors has been explicitly refuted in the literature , there is little to be gained from such a process .",
    "inevitably , such attempts stem from inadequate exploration of the material energy ",
    "momentum tensor , and ultimately all such arguments are overturned by the direct proofs of equivalence of the differing electromagnetic energy ",
    "momentum tensors discussed in sec .",
    "[ proofsequiv ] .",
    "these proofs arise directly from conservation of energy , linear and angular momentum for the system as a whole , and hence it is only in those rare papers which discard these constraints that differing predictions can be made in a logically consistent manner .",
    "towards the end of the 1960s , a number of researchers were demonstrating greater awareness of the role of the material energy  momentum tensor in symmetry and in momentum conservation @xcite , and developing novel pairs of electromagnetic and material tensors with this in mind .",
    "@xcite took this further with the formulation of their `` principle of virtual power '' , developed as a tool to test the equivalence of a number of different formulations of electromagnetic theory . by applying this principle",
    "they were able to determine the incompleteness of both the minkowski and abraham tensors , and also of the tensors emerging from the @xcite , amperian @xcite and chu @xcite formulations of electromagnetism , and to identify the missing terms , and demonstrate that with properly constructed material counterparts , all these energy ",
    "momentum tensors are in agreement .",
    "a cogent summary of their arguments and results may be found in a review paper by @xcite , which also covers the approach of gordon , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gordon ] .",
    "like penfield and haus , @xcite also recognised the important role of the material energy ",
    "momentum tensor , and that conservation laws relating to energy and momentum should only be applied to closed thermodynamic systems . however , they disagree with penfield and haus on the correct form of the _ total _ energy  momentum tensor to which electromagnetic and material energy  momentum tensors must sum",
    ". this disagreement does not bear directly upon the abraham ",
    "minkowski controversy , but does reflect different overall assumptions about the behaviour of matter in the presence of an electromagnetic wave .",
    "de groot and suttorp have argued for the superiority of their expression as it is derived from considerations of the microscopic properties of the medium .",
    "as yet , no experimental comparison of these two different total energy ",
    "momentum tensors has been performed .    for the moment , however , the correct expression for the total energy ",
    "momentum tensor is unimportant . while eventually it might prove beneficial to our modelling of material behaviour to discriminate between the different propositions , for our purposes it suffices to denote the selected total energy ",

    "a frequent reaction is to announce that the experiment invalidates one of the electromagnetic energy ",
    "momentum tensors being considered .",
    "however , inevitably a suitable term will be identified and added on to the corresponding material energy  momentum tensor , or a new expression developed which is equivalent to the addition of such a term , and the new `` correct '' material energy ",

    "as the tensor pair is named by the structure of the electromagnetic member , and the necessary term may always be added to the material member , the tensor is therefore always able to be `` saved '' .    as an interesting alternative",
    ", the necessary term may be added to the electromagnetic tensor , and accompanied by a change of name .",
    "neither the abraham nor minkowski tensors as they are commonly used incorporate the electrostrictive effect .",
    "when the relevant term is added to the electromagnetic component of the abraham tensor , this is known as the helmholtz tensor @xcite .",
    "regrettably , the full ramifications of the works of penfield , haus , de groot and suttorp were not immediately appreciated by the physics community , perhaps because calculating the full expressions for the material energy ",
    "momentum tensors was somewhat laborious , and perhaps because the experiment of @xcite had yet to be performed , that of @xcite was not widely publicised , and thus no convincing situation had yet been recognised for which the conventional forms of the minkowski and abraham tensors failed or disagreed .",
    "in addition , de groot and suttorp derived a number of new tensor pairs which they felt were particularly relevant to specific situations , such as a neutral plasma , and which are documented in their book @xcite .",
    "a more practically oriented demonstration of the equivalence of the abraham and minkowski tensors was achieved by @xcite . in response to the experiment of ashkin and dziedzic ( see sec .  [ expts : ashkin ] above ) , he demonstrated that the field - related components of the material energy  momentum tensor propagated along with the electromagnetic component , rather than at the speed of sound in the medium as was sometimes assumed ( for example * ? ? ? * ) , and that the optical pulse length in ashkin and dziedzic s experiment was sufficiently long for pressure within the fluid to reach equilibrium , and so purely material effects such as pressure also needed to be considered .",
    "he then went on to show that both abraham s and minkowski s tensors predicted identical behaviour when an arbitrary radiation pulse traversed an air / fluid interface .",
    "we note that all real material bodies are to some extent capable of deformation , and hence allow the transmission of tension and pressure in a manner analogous to the effects considered in gordon s proof . the proof",
    "therefore readily generalises to arbitrary isotropic dielectric media for deformations small enough that dissipative effects such as hysteresis may be ignored , and has the potential for extrapolation to larger deformations and anisotropic cases .",
    "inhomogeneous dielectric materials might then be dealt with by breaking them down into infinitesimally small homogeneous chunks . however , as pointed out by @xcite , gordon s result is only explicitly demonstrated for materials of dielectric constant sufficiently close to unity .",
    "gordon s work was subsequently extended by @xcite with a number of interesting consequences , such as the generation of phonons by a finite width beam in an elastic solid .",
    "recognition of the deformable nature of the dielectric medium is fundamental to gordon s approach .",
    "we discuss the hazards associated with inappropriately treating the dielectric as a rigid body in sec .",

    "although the work of @xcite had provided the theoretical framework within which to demonstrate the formal equivalence of different choices of electromagnetic energy  momentum tensor , they stopped short of explicitly demonstrating this for commonly used tensors such as those of abraham and minkowski .",
    "this equivalence had been demonstrated by penfield and haus in 1967 , but it seems to have been little appreciated .",
    "subsequent , far shorter demonstrations of equivalence were produced by @xcite and by @xcite , who appears unaware of the work of either penfield and haus or de groot and suttorp , as he cites later papers by @xcite as conjecturing a `` sliding '' relationship between electromagnetic and material energy  momentum tensors .",
    "the paper by mikura is particularly readable , but both are recommended to anyone seeking greater mathematical detail than is provided in this review .",
    "@xcite also demonstrates that the behaviours predicted by the classical abraham and minkowski tensors are equivalent up to the action of the abraham force , but does not take the final step of postulating a material counterpart to the minkowski tensor .",
    "he therefore concludes that while the minkowski tensor is not strictly correct , it is nevertheless useable under many circumstances .",
    "a response to @xcite by @xcite supports krany s result but criticises him for not including enough references , and for confining himself to considering only the abraham and minkowski tensors .",
    "maugin extends krany s work to consider tensors due to @xcite and @xcite in non - dissipative materials , with remarks about extension to more arbitrary cases , and the use of this approach to demonstrate the equivalence of any other energy ",
    "momentum tensor with those already considered .",
    "@xcite then extends the work of krany and maugin to include media which may be magnetised and/or electrically polarised .",

    "momentum tensor from eqs .",
    "( [ nodiv ] ) , ( [ symmetry ] ) and ( [ construct ] ) , as valid expressions for the total energy  momentum tensor @xmath36 may only vary by a term which is symmetric and divergence free , and hence carries no momentum at all .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ arguments ] , an unpublished memorandum by @xcite is credited with first drawing the parallel between the minkowski electromagnetic momentum density and pseudomomentum . in doing so ,",
    "he introduced a viewpoint in which both the abraham and minkowski expressions had a valid role . this view is further developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and our review would be incomplete without discussing this important recognition .",
    "@xcite provides a thought experiment which we may use to illustrate this .",
    "consider a perfectly transparent glass rod , initially at rest , with a perfect anti - reflection coating on each end .",
    "a wave packet may pass either alongside the rod , or through it .",
    "no external force acts on the combined system of rod and wave packet , so the centre of mass of the system must have constant velocity",
    ". however , if the wave packet enters the rod , it slows down by a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "this must therefore be accompanied by a movement of the rod in the direction of propagation of the wave packet so that the velocity of the centre of mass is preserved .",
    "as the rod is perfectly transparent , no momentum is absorbed from the wave packet , and when the wave packet departs the rod it must leave the rod at rest . by comparing the trajectories of the centre of mass with the wave packet passing either inside or outside the glass rod , we can show that the rod experiences a finite displacement during the traversal of the wave packet , which we may interpret as resulting from the action of the lorentz force on the atomic dipoles which make up the rod .",
    "while the rod is moving , it clearly has momentum .",
    "the abraham approach identifies this as mechanical momentum .",
    "however , the minkowski approach recognises that this momentum propagates with and arises from the presence of the electromagnetic wave , and hence classifies it as electromagnetic momentum .",
    "we may well have qualms about describing the motion of a material body as electromagnetic momentum .",
    "therefore , we may call the abraham momentum the true momentum of an electromagnetic wave , and the minkowski momentum the pseudomomentum , this being the physically useful quantity of all momentum associated with the propagation of the wave .",
    "( nelson adopts a different terminology , in which pseudomomentum excludes electromagnetic momentum , and the total momentum associated with the propagation of a wave is termed `` wave momentum '' .",
    "his chosen expression for electromagnetic momentum also differs , though this has no effect on the total momentum .",
    "nelson identifies the minkowski momentum with wave momentum , less a term due to dispersion . )",
    "this argument may appear compelling , but before the reader confidently declares the abraham momentum to be the only true electromagnetic momentum , they should recall that every expression appears compelling within the context of the arguments on which it is founded . for example",
    ", @xcite presented an alternative chain of argument leading to an electromagnetic momentum density of @xmath71 .",
    "this expression seems unlikely in the context of the above discussion of momentum and pseudomomentum , but in the approach taken by mansuripur it is the abraham and minkowski expressions which appear inappropriate , and this hybrid electromagnetic momentum density which seems the inevitable conclusion .",
    "of course , it is momentum transfer which determines experimental results , and this takes place identically regardless of whether we describe it as electromagnetic or material in nature .",
    "we therefore reprise our position stated in the abstract , that the reader may describe as electromagnetic whatever portion of the total momentum flux appears most appropriate , in the context in which they are working .",
    "provided all momentum is ultimately accounted for , this will have no effect on their predicted experimental results .",
    "@xcite has given the conditions under which the pseudomomentum approach will reliably describe momentum transfer to an object in a fluid dielectric medium .",

    "although the assumed momentum density differs from that yielded by the total energy ",
    "momentum tensor , the simultaneous identification of the momentum flux as @xmath180 instead of @xmath143 yields the correct overall result , up to a factor of @xmath181 .",
    "this works because the minkowski material momentum density is typically numerically very close to zero , and hence the total momentum density may be reasonably approximated by the electromagnetic momentum density @xmath73 . that the total momentum flux is given by @xmath180 then follows from gauss s law .",
    "the result is satisfactory when the error introduced by this approximation is small .",
    "now consider a beam of light incident upon a block of perfectly nonreflective dielectric of higher refractive index than the surrounding medium .",
    "@xcite considers the transmission of a wave packet through a glass rod with anti - reflection coatings on both ends .",
    "if we are interested in the behaviour of the surface , then surface terms must be taken into account using ( [ eq : fullforce ] ) , but if we are only interested in the motion of the centre of mass of the block , then we can neglect the surface forces provided the time average of the integral ( [ eq : boundary ] ) goes to zero over a period much less than the sensitivity of our apparatus . for a laser beam traversing a dielectric block , we may eliminate the field - related terms of the integral if the electromagnetic fields where the beam enters and leaves the block are identical up to a phase . at its simplest",
    "this requires zero reflection , zero absorption , and that the two surfaces be parallel .",
    "we may eliminate the remainder of the terms by choosing the surrounding medium to be vacuum .",
    "the behaviour of the centre of mass of the block may then be determined using ( [ eq : volforce ] ) . for @xmath182 ,",
    "the block accelerates away from the beam source while it is traversed by the leading edge of the beam , then continues to travel away from the source at constant velocity while the beam is turned on .",
    "when the beam is turned off , traversal of the trailing edge restores the block to rest .",
    "the use of ( [ eq : volforce ] ) can also readily be extended to include absorption , giving rise to an additional ongoing acceleration .      the most general case to consider is a partially reflective dielectric block suspended within an arbitrary dielectric medium . in the absence of simplifying assumptions we must employ the full expression ( [ eq : fullforce ] ) , with both a surface and a volume term .",
    "we may compare this with the work of @xcite , who calculated the forces on a dielectric using the lorentz force .",
    "integration of the lorentz force density over the volume of the dielectric gives a volume term , whereas reflection of a portion of the incoming radiation gives rise to a surface term .",
    "although mansuripur examined pressure and tension arising within the dielectric block as a result of the incident radiation , contributions of these effects to the net surface force , as in @xcite , are not discussed .",
    "these forces make no contribution to the motion of the centre of mass , but will affect the behaviour of the surface if the block is treated as flexible .",
    "mansuripur obtained an expression for the electromagnetic momentum density in a dielectric medium from the rate of transfer of momentum into the medium both as electromagnetic fields and via the lorentz force , but excluded momentum transferred to the surface via reflection , which he considered non - electromagnetic .",
    "however , this merely represents a further scheme by which to subdivide the total energy  momentum tensor , and when electromagnetic radiation passes from one medium into another , both bulk and surface forces will be present .",
    "momentum flux through the boundary under this scheme is therefore indistinguishable from the combined electromagnetic and material tensors of either abraham or minkowski .",
    "how mansuripur s definition of the electromagnetic momentum density extends to moving media has yet to be established .    in general",
    ", momentum transfer to the surface of a dielectric block arises both from interactions with the external environment and from pressure effects within the block itself .",
    "this may cause regions of relative compression or rarefaction close to the surface , depending on whether the surface force is of the same or opposite sign to the lorentz force which acts on the bulk of the block . for dielectric fluids , a flow may result . when eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullforce ] ) is used , these effects are taken into account via the material components of the total energy ",
    "momentum tensor .",
    "such effects are seen in the experiment of @xcite discussed in sec .",
    "[ expts : ashkin ] , where the surface of the water bulges towards the source of the laser beam , although the lorentz force within the body of the liquid acts in the opposite direction .",
    "it is frequently possible to make simplifying assumptions .",
    "we have already considered a perfectly reflecting mirror , for which no volume term arises , and a perfectly transmissive dielectric in vacuum , for which the surface term has no effect on the motion of the centre of mass .    also , it is often possible to use the abraham or minkowski energy ",
    "momentum tensors in the traditional manner .",
    "the abraham tensor pair are well suited to problems in highly transmissive dielectrics , such as example  [ nonreflec ] , as momentum transfer to the material component may be identified with the lorentz force @xcite .",
    "the minkowski electromagnetic energy  momentum density is frequently used to calculate momentum transfer across a boundary , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ ex : mirror ] .",
    "it is important to note that electrostriction , magnetostriction , dispersion , and acoustic waves are rarely treated in the literature , though with some exceptions @xcite . when these effects are significant , an appropriate material energy ",
    "momentum tensor must always be used .",
    "rigorous treatment using a lorentz force approach @xcite is also a viable option under any circumstances , provided sufficient care is taken over field / charge interactions at the surface @xcite , and may frequently be the simpler approach . where the behaviour of the surface is important , for example in the behaviour of dielectric liquids @xcite , stress- or pressure - related effects",
    "must also be considered .",
    "over the years , a large number of tensor - dependent effects have been proposed , by which it has been suggested that it might be possible to distinguish between the different tensor formulations .",
    "these tend to arise either from inadequately considering the role of the material energy ",
    "momentum tensor , or from inappropriately treating the dielectric medium as a rigid body .",
    "failure to adequately consider the role of the material energy ",
    "momentum tensor may lead to claims of experimental discrimination between the different energy  momentum tensors , as in @xcite , and hypothetical thrusters based on non - conservation of momentum @xcite .",
    "perhaps more important is the error of treating the dielectric as a rigid body , an error which recurs frequently within the literature @xcite and also leads to inappropriate predictions of unusual physical behaviour .      consider a pulsed electromagnetic wave of momentum @xmath3 entering a material body of refractive index @xmath5 .",
    "if we use the minkowski electromagnetic energy  momentum tensor , on entering the body the momentum of the wave is increased to @xmath4 and hence by conservation of linear momentum , the body acquires a momentum of @xmath183 , setting it in motion towards the source of the wave .",
    "when the pulse exits the body , the momentum of the material is restored to zero and the body returns to a stationary state . in contrast , under the abraham tensor the momentum of the pulse decreases and the body must begin moving away from the source of the wave . @xcite discussed such behaviour in the context of an einstein box  a rigid box in which photons are emitted from one end and absorbed by the other , typically used as a thought experiment to demonstrate mass  energy equivalency .    because the body is treated as rigid and hence unable to deform",
    ", momentum is transferred to the body as a whole , propagating across it instantaneously . in reality",
    ", the transfer of momentum must take place at a finite velocity which can not exceed @xmath29 and will therefore either be much less than , or of comparable magnitude to , the speed of light in the medium , @xmath184 . because of this , significant compressive and expansive effects must take place , which are neglected if the body is treated as rigid .    this approach also mis - handles momentum associated with the material body under the minkowski tensor . as seen in ( [ eq : minkmat ] ) , the minkowski material momentum density includes a term @xmath185 , which causes the material momentum density as a whole to be negative .",
    "however , this term is not associated with the movement of material particles described by @xmath104 , and is therefore not related to the motion of material particles within the block . while it is necessary for the material tensor momentum density to be negative in order to offset the increase in momentum density in the minkowski electromagnetic tensor , not all of this momentum density is associated with the particles of the block .",
    "in fact , the behaviour of these * v*-dependent terms is identical to that under the abraham tensor and the block gains positive momentum , although the material momentum density as a whole becomes negative under the minkowski scheme .    when these effects are treated correctly , we recover an approach equivalent to that of @xcite , as discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : gordon ] , and the traversal of the light pulse now generates a distortion in the boundary of the medium . when the leading edge of the pulse enters the medium , the boundary bulges outwards , as demonstrated by the experiments of @xcite , and a similar outward bulge",
    "is produced when the leading edge exits the medium .",
    "the traversal of the trailing edge of the pulse gives rise to a restoring impulse in each case .",
    "meanwhile , the unopposed action of the lorentz force within the bulk of the medium gives rise to the motion of the body as a whole .",
    "the resulting behaviour is identical under both the abraham and minkowski tensors . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ mompseudomom ] , @xcite demonstrated that a perfectly transmitting dielectric of higher refractive index than its surroundings will advance in the direction of propagation of the wave packet , using arguments relating to the movement of the centre of mass of the system .",
    "however he then erroneously applies the rigid body argument given above , and concludes against the minkowski electromagnetic energy  momentum tensor . in reality , as we have seen in sec .",
    "[ nonreflec ] , both choices when used correctly will yield the same lorentz forces acting on the body of the rod , accompanied by any surface effects due to pressures within the rod as per @xcite and @xcite , because regardless of whether we choose the minkowski or abraham representation , the total energy ",
    "momentum tensor remains unchanged .",
    "we note that in a real medium , coupling between adjacent surface elements ( for example , surface tension in a liquid or lattice forces in a solid ) may cause disturbances generated by surface forces to propagate radially outwards .",
    "thus in an absorptive medium , traversal of a radiation pulse may give rise to acoustic ( matter ) waves within the substance of the medium , but once again the predicted behaviour will be independent of the choice of energy ",
    "momentum tensors used .",
    "@xcite showed that such photon / phonon coupling may also take place where the edges of a finite beam lie within a dielectric .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , current research on the electromagnetic energy ",
    "momentum tensor relates largely to practical applications , or to the extension of existing knowledge into new domains , though there are still many who appear unaware that the abraham ",
    "minkowski controversy has been resolved .",
    "we present and discuss some of the more recent papers , to illustrate the present state of research in the field .",
    "obviously , any theoretical result requires verification . the ability of combined electromagnetic and material energy ",
    "momentum tensors constrained by conservation of linear and angular momentum to explain historical experiments such as those discussed in this paper is well established .",
    "however , continued testing of such theories over an increasingly broad range of domains is an essential part of the process of physics research . in this regard",
    ", we refer to the proposal of @xcite to demonstrate the abraham force at optical frequencies , and the work of @xcite seeking violation of conservation of momentum , though his reported positive results fare poorly under independent scrutiny @xcite .    extending existing classical theory ,",
    "@xcite directly derived the force of electromagnetic radiation on a material medium from the lorentz force law , an approach which makes no pre - emptive assumptions regarding the value of the electromagnetic momentum .",
    "he reproduced the beam edge effects first discussed by @xcite , but with the discovery that this force may be expansive , rather than constrictive , for @xmath3-polarised light , an effect which awaits experimental verification .",
    "he also deduced that anti - reflective coatings experience a force which attempts to peel them off their substrate .",
    "like many others , in the course of this paper he derived a unique `` correct '' expression for the electromagnetic momentum density .",
    "there are almost as many such expressions as there are authors , and if we restrict physics to dealing only with hypotheses which may be tested by experiment , then the question of the correct expression is instead one of ontology .",
    "however , as physical predictions are independent of the expression chosen ( see sec .",
    "[ proofsequiv ] ) , this in no way detracts from the significance of his other findings .",
    "other recent work includes the experiment of @xcite to determine whether , when a photon is absorbed by an atom within an atomic cloud , it should be considered as departing the medium , and therefore only transfer the momentum of @xmath186 to the atom , in accordance with @xcite , or whether it transfers the minkowski value @xmath187 , leaving behind a disturbance in the medium , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the latter case was determined to be correct , with significance for the construction and operation of atom interferometers .",
    "using quantum theory , @xcite developed operators for the momentum of a photon in a dielectric medium . employing a quantisation scheme proposed by @xcite",
    ", they arrived at a situation they recognise to be directly analogous to the abraham ",
    "minkowski controversy .",
    "their survey of the literature included the recognition , which they attributed to @xcite , that decomposition of the total energy ",
    "momentum tensor into electromagnetic and material components is arbitrary .",
    "however , due to the inconsistent nature of the available literature , this was stated as simply one possible position of many , rather than an obligate consequence of momentum conservation .",
    "@xcite proceeded to develop three momentum operators  abraham and minkowski momentum operators , corresponding to classical momenta calculated utilising the isolated electromagnetic energy  momentum tensors of abraham and minkowski , and a canonical momentum operator , which is the generator of translations , and relates to the total energy  momentum tensor .",
    "they reanalysed the results of @xcite , and demonstrated that the experiment favours the canonical momentum operator over both the abraham and minkowski operators .",
    "this is to be expected , as no operators were employed which related to either the corresponding material momentum flux or the maxwell stress tensor , and hence only the canonical momentum operator accounts for the total flux of momentum within the system .",
    "their analysis is novel , in that it demonstrates that the results of jones and leslie are of sufficient accuracy to distinguish between the total energy ",
    "momentum tensor , and the electromagnetic energy  momentum tensor of minkowski in isolation . by doing so",
    ", they therefore provide additional experimental verification that the minkowski tensor , like the abraham tensor , is incomplete without a material counterpart . for any real medium",
    "the minkowski material counterpart tensor will yield not only the abraham term , but also terms giving rise to acoustic transients @xcite and a dispersion - related coupling between the electromagnetic wave and the material medium @xcite .",
    "this latter effect is responsible for the observed discrepancy between the canonical momentum and the minkowski electromagnetic momentum .",
    "garrison and chiao concluded that the canonical ( total ) momentum is most applicable for interpreting experiments , and question whether the use of abraham and minkowski operators can ever be appropriate .",
    "however , they weaken their conclusion by citing the experiment of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and sec .",
    "[ expts : walker ] above ) as uniquely selecting the abraham tensor , despite having earlier cited @xcite , who indirectly disprove this assertion .",
    "they also present the arguments of @xcite as similarly favouring the abraham tensor , though these have been refuted by @xcite , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ arguments ] . garrison and chiao",
    "do not examine the experiment of walker _",
    "et al . _ or the suggestion of @xcite in their quantum - mechanical formalism , which is a pity , since they",
    "might then have concluded that once again , it is conservation of the canonical momentum which governs the experiments behaviour .",
    "@xcite also investigate momentum transfer from a quantum perspective , looking at the absorption of photons by charge carriers in a semi - conductor .",
    "they found that momentum transfer can be divided into three separate components : momentum transfer to the charge carriers , given by the minkowski value @xmath188 and in agreement with previous experiment @xcite , to the bulk of the semi - conductor , given by the abraham value @xmath189 , and to the surface of the dielectric , yielding overall conservation of momentum .",
    "a classical treatment by @xcite again results in transfer of the minkowski value of momentum to the charge carriers , with the net action on the host semiconductor maintaining global conservation of momentum .",
    "@xcite has looked at the transfer of momentum between matter and the electromagnetic field on the quantum scale , and predicted the intriguing phenomenon of fluid flow powered by quantum vacuum fluctuations which is dependent upon the high - frequency cutoff of quantum field theory .",
    "several have found the electromagnetic energy ",
    "momentum tensor important in extension of the casimir effect from vacuum - separated plates to those separated by a dielectric matierial .",
    "@xcite related the importance of recognising that the minkowski tensor on its own is incomplete , and @xcite suggested that consideration of the total momentum flux density is most appropriate .",
    "stallinga also demonstrated how a classical technique utilising an artificial `` auxiliary field '' @xmath190 may be useful in modelling dissipative systems .    of interest for different reasons",
    "is the somewhat older work of @xcite in representing the behaviour of massless photons in a material medium as that of equivalent massive particles in vacuum . due to a transformation effectively eliminating the material medium , all momentum",
    "is contained within the electromagnetic energy ",
    "momentum tensor , and in this special case , the criteria of von laue and mller ( see sec .",
    "[ arguments ] ) are fulfilled . in terms of the abraham ",
    "minkowski controversy , cole is in effect choosing an energy  momentum tensor in which all active terms are placed within the electromagnetic tensor and the material energy ",
    "momentum tensor is always null .",
    "more recently , @xcite have drawn attention to a related treatment of the constitutive equation of electromagnetism by @xcite , valid for a medium homogeneous and isotropic in its local rest frame .",
    "a similar approach is also of practical relevance in modelling optical trapping . since all forces acting due to transfer of momentum from fields and media must be considered , and the trapped particle is typically suspended in a dielectric medium , a separation of the field and material components of the momentum flux that allows the surrounding medium to be ignored can simplify calculation of the optical force .",
    "this separation requires that the surrounding medium carries none of the momentum , a condition which is adequately met by the minkowski tensor provided both dispersion and the abraham force are negligible , the fluid medium has had time to reach equilibrium , and behaviours such as electrostriction and magnetostriction , which are not supported by the electromagnetic component of this tensor , may be neglected .",
    "the trapped particle can then be modelled as a dielectric particle of refractive index @xmath191 in free space , with the beam delivering a momentum flux density of @xmath192 .",
    "this method is best suited to monochromatic light or nondispersive media , where @xmath5 may be treated as a constant . for a rigid particle ,",
    "the optical forces can be calculated from the incoming and outgoing momentum fluxes  @xcite . for a deformable particle , for example in an optical stretcher  @xcite",
    ", one needs to include the mechanical elastic forces that resist the field or medium forces acting to deform the particle , as well as the field or medium forces themselves . while it may be simplest to assume the minkowski momentum , the alternative tensors are nevertheless physically equivalent .",
    "statements which are based on the interpretation of a single tensor , for example suggesting that the deforming force arises because the momentum of a photon in a medium is @xmath193 , compared to @xmath194 in vacuum , are therefore unwise .",
    "the work of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite effectively demonstrated that division of the total energy  momentum tensor into electromagnetic and material parts is effectively arbitrary .",
    "nevertheless , many continue to attempt to identify a superior expression for the electromagnetic energy  momentum tensor .",
    "often they are aware of the work of penfield and haus , and de groot and suttorp , and one must therefore suppose that these works , perhaps on account of complexity or lack of sufficient emphasis , are proving ineffective in conveying that such a distinction is at the very least untestable . for gordon , one may point to the limited scope to which his treatment may be applied , and for mikura , krany and maugin the problem appears to be insufficient publicity .",
