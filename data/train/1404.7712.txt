    "galactic open clusters ( ocs ) have long been considered excellent targets not only to probe the galactic disc properties @xcite but also to trace its chemical evolution ( see , e.g. , chen et al . , 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "because it is relatively simple to estimate ages , distances and metallicities of ocs fairly accurately , their basic parameters constitute excellent tracers to the structure and chemical evolution of the galactic disc . the proximity of most ocs to the galactic plane , however , usually restricts this analysis to the most populous ones and/or to those located within a few kpc from the sun ( bonatto et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "although there are at present estimates of a total of about @xmath6 ocs in the milky way @xcite , there is not yet an estimation of fundamental parameters such as reddening , distance and age for nearly 30% of the @xmath2 2200 catalogued galactic ocs @xcite .",
    "the present work is part of a current project of photometric observation of galactic ocs in the washington system that is being developed at the observatorio astronmico de la universidad nacional de crdoba ( argentina ) .",
    "this project aims at determining the fundamental parameters or at refining the quality of observationally determined properties for some unstudied or poorly studied ocs , located in different regions of the milky way .",
    "washington photometry has proved to be a valuable tool to determine the fundamental parameters of ocs since information on cluster membership , reddening , distance , age and metallicity is obtained through the analysis of the @xmath3 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "we have already reported results based on washington ccd @xmath7 photometric data on several young ( e.g. , piatti et al .",
    "2003a ) , intermediate - age ( e.g. , clari et al . , 2007 ) and old galactic ocs ( e.g. , piatti et al .",
    "these studies have contributed not only to the individual characterization of these stellar systems but also to the global understanding of some properties of the galactic disc ( e.g. , parisi et al . 2005 ) .    in this study",
    "we provide new high - quality photometric ccd data obtained with the washington system @xmath0 and @xmath1 passbands down to @xmath1 @xmath2 18.5 magnitudes in the fields of four faint , poorly studied ocs , namely bh84 , ngc5381 , bh211 and czernik37",

    "the observations of the selected clusters were carried out with the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio , chile ) 0.9 m telescope , during the nights of 2008 may 9 - 11 , with a 2048@xmath172048 pixel tektronix ccd .",
    "the scale on the chip is 0.396 `` pixel@xmath18 ( focal ratio f/13.5 ) yielding a visual field of 13.6@xmath1713.6. we controlled the ccd through the ctio arcon 3.3 data acquisition system in the standard quad amplifier mode , with a mean gain and readout noise of 1.5 e@xmath19/adu and 4.2 e@xmath19 , respectively .",

    "typically 20 standard stars taken from the list of @xcite , covering a wide range in color , were nightly observed .",
    "table 2 shows the log of the observations with dates , filters , exposure times and airmasses .",
    "in addition , a series of 10 bias and five dome and sky flat - field exposures per filter were obtained nightly .",

    "1 shows schematic finding charts of the observed cluster fields built with all the measured stars in the @xmath1 band .",
    "the @xmath7 images were reduced at the observatorio astronmico de la universidad nacional de crdoba ( argentina ) with iraf , using the quadproc package . after applying the overscan - bias subtraction for the four amplifiers independently",
    ", we carried out flat - field corrections using a combined sky - flat frame , which was previously checked for nonuniform illumination pattern with the averaged dome - flat frame .",
    "then , we did aperture photometry for the standard star fields using the phot task within daophot ii @xcite .",
    "the relationships between instrumental and standard magnitudes were obtained by fitting the equations :    @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 represents the effective airmass and capital and lowercase letters stand for standard and instrumental magnitudes , respectively . the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 = 1 , 2 and 3 ) were nightly derived through the iraf routine fitparam . the resulting mean coefficients together with their errors are shown in table 3 ; the typical rms errors of equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are 0.017 and 0.015 mag , respectively , indicating the nights were of good photometric quality .",
    "point spread function ( psf ) photometry for the selected fields was performed using the stand - alone version of the daophot ii package @xcite , which provided us with @xmath27 and @xmath28 coordinates and instrumental @xmath29 and @xmath30 magnitudes for all the stars identified in each field .",
    "the psfs were generated from two samples of 35 - 40 and @xmath2 100 stars interactively selected .",
    "for each frame , a quadratically varying psf was derived by fitting the stars in the larger sample , once their neighbors were eliminted using a preliminary psf obtained from the smaller star sample , which contained the brightest , least contaminated stars .",
    "we then used allstar program to apply the resulting psf to the identified stellar objects and create a subtracted image , which was used to find and measure magnitudes of additional fainter stars .",
    "the psf magnitudes were determined using as zero points the aperture magnitudes yielded by phot .",
    "this procedure was repeated three times on each frame .",
    "next , we computed aperture corrections from the comparison of psf and aperture magnitudes using the subtracted neighbor psf star sample .",
    "the resulting aperture corrections were on average less than 0.02 mag ( absolute value ) for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "note that psf stars are distributed throughout the whole ccd frame , so that variations of aperture corrections should be negligible .",
    "finally , the standard magnitudes and colors for all the measured stars were computed by inverting equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , once positions and instrumental @xmath29 and @xmath30 magnitudes of stars in the same field were matched using stetson s daomatch and daomaster programs .",
    "once we obtained the standard magnitudes and colors , we built a master table containing the average of @xmath1 and @xmath31 , their errors @xmath32@xmath33 and @xmath32@xmath34 and the number of observations for each star , respectively .",
    "we derived magnitudes and colors for 1884 , 2439 , 979 and 1129 stars in the fields of bh84 , ngc5381 , bh211 and",
    "czernik37 , respectively . these values are provided in tables 4 - 7 .",
    "magnitude and color errors are the standard deviation of the mean or the observed photometric errors for stars with only one measurement . tables 4 - 7 are only partially presented here as guidance , regarding their form and content .",
    "the complete tables can be found on the on - line version of the journal .",
    "2 shows the behavior of the @xmath1 and @xmath31 photometric errors as a function of @xmath1 for stars measured in the field of ngc5381 , the most populated observed field .",
    "note that @xmath32@xmath1 and @xmath32@xmath34 appear to be smaller than 0.04 magnitudes for stars brighter than @xmath1 @xmath2 18.5 and 17.5 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "the bright stars having large associated errors are stars saturated in all frames , bits of stars or even failures in the detector erroneously taken as stars by daophot .",
    "it can be observed in section 4 that these stars do not affect at all the fundamental parameter determination of the observed clusters .",
    "bearing in mind the behavior of the photometric errors with the @xmath1 magnitude for the observed stars in fig .",
    "2 , we trust the accuracy of the morphology and position of the main clster features in the @xmath3 cmds . fig .",
    "3 shows these cmds for all the observed stars in the different fields .",
    "they appear to be contaminated by field stars , as should be expected since all the studied ocs are projected on to the galactic center direction . as can be seen in fig 3 , the faintest @xmath1 magnitudes obtained for each cluster",
    "are such that they allow the mapping of most of the cluster main sequences ( mss ) .",
    "if there are still fainter stars in the clusters , then they practically do not add any information to the one already obtained .",
    "cluster mss appear as broad sequences of stars among crowded field features . on the other hand",
    ", a group of comparatively bright late - type stars in bh211 seems to form the cluster red giant clump ( rgc ) centered at @xmath1 @xmath2 12.5 and @xmath34 @xmath2 3.2 magnitudes , which indicates that we are possibly dealing with an intermediate - age oc .",
    "to determine the central position of the clusters on a firm basis , we applied a statistical method consisting in tracing the stellar density profiles projected on to the directions of the @xmath27 and @xmath28-axes .",
    "the coordinates of the clusters centers and their estimated uncertainties were determined by fitting gaussian distributions to the star counts in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 directions for each cluster .",
    "the fits of the gaussians were performed using the ngaussfit routine in the stsdas / iraf package .",
    "we adopted a single gaussian and decided to fix the constant and the linear terms to the corresponding background levels and to zero , respectively .",
    "we used as variables the center of the gaussian , its amplitude and its fwhm . after eliminating a couple of scattered points , the fitting procedure converged after one iteration on average",
    "the stars projected along the @xmath27 and @xmath28 directions were counted within intervals of 50 pixels in bh84 and ngc5381 and within intervals of 75 pixels in bh211 and czernik37 .",
    "we determined the central position of the clusters with a typical ngaussfit standard deviation of @xmath14 10 pixels ( @xmath2 4 \" ) in all cases .",
    "the centers of the gaussians were finally fixed at ( @xmath35 ) = ( 969,1040 ) , ( 940,1012 ) , ( 964,1145 ) and ( 894,1105 ) pixels for bh84 , ngc5381 , bh211 and",
    "czernik37 , respectively . these values were adopted for the analysis that follows .",
    "cluster centers are marked by a cross in fig .",
    "we then built clusters radial profiles , from which we estimated the cluster radii , generally used as an indicator of cluster dimensions .",
    "cluster stellar density radial profiles are usually built by counting the number of stars distributed in concentric rings around the cluster center and normalizing the sum of stars in each ring to the unit area . although this procedure allows us to stretch the radial profile to its utmost , until complete circles can no longer be traced in the observed field , we preferred to follow another method in order to move even further away from the cluster center .",
    "this method is based on counts of stars located in boxes of 50 pixels a side , distributed throughout the whole field of each cluster .",
    "thus , the number of stars per unit area at a given @xmath30 can be directly calculated through the expression :    @xmath36,\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the number of counted stars and boxes included in a circle of radius @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "note that this procedure does not necessarily require a complete circle of radius @xmath30 within the observed field to estimate the mean stellar density at such distance .",
    "it is important to consider this fact since having a stellar density profile which extends far away from the cluster center allows us to estimate the background level with higher precision .",
    "this is necessary to derive the cluster radius ( @xmath40 ) , defined as the distance from the cluster center where the stellar density profile intersects the background level .",
    "it is also helpful to measure the fwhm of the stellar density profile , which plays an important role in the construction of the cluster cmds .",
    "the resulting density profiles expressed as number of stars per unit area in arcmin@xmath41 are presented in fig .",
    "4 . the uncertainties estimated at various distances from the cluster centers follow poisson statistics .",
    "the new equatorial coordinates derived for the clusters in this study are listed in table 1 , while columns 2 - 4 of table 8 list the radii at the fwhm ( @xmath42 ) , the estimated radii which yield the best enhanced cluster fiducial features ( @xmath43 ) and the cluster radii ( @xmath44 . the different linear radii in parsecs were determined using the heliocentric distances derived in section 4 .",
    "cmds covering different circular extractions around each cluster center were constructed , as shown in figs .",
    "the panels in the figures are arranged , from left to right and from top to bottom , in such a way that they exhibit the variations in stellar population from the innermost to the outermost regions of the cluster fields .",
    "we started with the cmd for stars distributed within @xmath30 @xmath9 @xmath42 , followed by those of the cluster regions delimited by @xmath30 @xmath9 @xmath43 and @xmath30 @xmath9 @xmath40 and finally by the adopted field cmd .",
    "we used the cmds corresponding to the stars within @xmath42 as the cluster fiducial sequence references .",
    "then , we varied the distance from the cluster centers , starting at @xmath42 .",
    "next , we built different series of extracted cmds .",
    "finally , we chose those cmds - one per cluster - which maximize the star cluster population and minimize the field star contamination in the cmds .",
    "the main cluster features can be identified by inspecting the right top panels of figs .",
    "note that the cluster mss look well populated , particularly in ngc5381 , all of them showing clear evidence of evolution .",
    "these mss develop along @xmath2 5 magnitudes in bh84 and czernik37 and along @xmath2 5 - 6 magnitudes in ngc5381 and bh211 .",
    "the hook at the ms turnoff of bh211 s cmd and the rgc centered at @xmath1 @xmath2 12.5 and @xmath31 @xmath2 3.2 magnitudes indicate that we are dealing with an intermediate - age oc .",
    "the width of the clusters mss is clearly not the result of photometric errors , since these hardly reach a tenth of magnitude at any @xmath1 level .",
    "thus , such width could be caused by intrinsic effects ( binarity , rotation , evolution , etc . ) , by differential reddening and/or by field star contamination . to derive the cluster fudamental parameters",
    ", we will use the cmds with @xmath30 @xmath9 @xmath45    although , as we mentioned above , the broadness of the clusters mss is certainly due to several effects , in the particular case of czernik37 , a clear variation of the interstellar reddenning across the cluster field seems to be present . in case",
    "this effect indeed existed in the remaining clusters , it is by far less evident .",
    "the lower limit estimated by @xcite for clusters with differential reddening is @xmath46@xmath47 = 0.11 , which corresponds to @xmath46@xmath34 = 0.22 , if a value of 1.97 for the @xmath48/@xmath12 ratio @xcite is adopted . from the right top panel of fig .",
    "8 , we estimated @xmath46@xmath34 @xmath2 1.0 mag for czernik37 , a value which largely exceeds the limit established by @xcite .",
    "the existence of differential reddening in czernik37 makes the determination of its fundamental parameters very difficutl , particularly its reddening and its heliocentric distance .",
    "it is for this reason that the resulting parameters for czernik37 present associated errors larger than in the other clusters .",
    "the widely used procedure of fitting theoretical isochrones to observed cmds was employed to estimate the @xmath48 color excess , the @xmath1-m@xmath49 apparent distance modulus and the age and metallicity of the clusters .",
    "it is well known that the metallicity of a cluster plays an important role when its age is estimated from the fit of theoretical isochrones .",
    "indeed , isochrones with the same age but with different metallicities can range from slightly to remarkably distinguishable , depending on their sensitivity to metal content .",
    "the @xmath3 cmd , for example , is nearly three times more metal sensitive than the @xmath50 cmd @xcite .",
    "the distinction is particularly evident for the evolved phases of the rgc and the giant branch .",
    "as far as zero - age main sequences ( zamss ) are concerned , they are often less affected by metallicity effects , and can even exhibit imperceptible variations for a specific metallicity range within the photometric errors .",
    "this is the case of galactic ocs , therefore including the four clusters here studied . since there are no previous available estimates of their metallicities , we followed the general rule of starting by the adoption of both solar ( @xmath5 = 0.019 ) and sub - solar ( @xmath5 = 0.008 ) values for the clusters metal content .",
    "as for the isochrone sets , we used those computed by the padova group @xcite in steps of @xmath46log age = 0.05 dex .",
    "as shown in previous studies ( e.g. , piatti et al . , 2003b ) , these isochrones lead to results similar to those derived from the geneve group s isochrones @xcite .",
    "we preferred to use the padova group s isochrones because they reach fainter magnitudes , thus allowing a better fit to the cluster fainter portions of the mss .",
    "then , we first selected zamss with @xmath5 = 0.019 and 0.008 ( [ fe / h ] = 0.0 and -0.4 dex ) and fitted these zamss to the cluster cmds to derive color excesses and apparent distance moduli for each selected metallicity . since the fits are performed through the lower envelope of the cluster s mss , the presence of binaries practically does not affect the choice of the best isochrones . note that when @xmath5 = 0.019 is used in the fits , the resulting cluster reddenings and distances turn out to be slightly larger than the values obtained using z = 0.008 .",
    "the increases in distance vary from 250 pc to 500 pc depending on the cluster , while the increase in reddening is within error limits .",
    "then , using each of the derived [ @xmath48,@xmath1-m@xmath49]@xmath52 sets , we performed isochrone fits .",
    "we repeated the fits for a larger number of isochrones covering appropriate age ranges according to each cluster . the brightest magnitude in the ms , the bluest point of the turnoff and the locus of the rgc , when visible , were used as reference points during the fits .",
    "finally , we chose the best fit for each [ @xmath48,@xmath1-m@xmath49]@xmath52 set and compared all the individual best fits to choose the one which best reproduced the cluster features . in all cases , the best fits were done only by eye and they were obtained using solar metallicity isochrones .",
    "we would like to point out that the bright stars with very large associated errors in fig .",
    "2 correspond to objects located beyond ngc5381 @xmath43 .",
    "for this reason , these stars do not affect the cluster parameter determination in ngc5381 .",
    "something similar occurs with the other three studied clusters .",
    "9 illustrates the results of our task , while table 9 lists the estimated @xmath12 color excesses , heliocentric distances , ages and metallicities of the clusters .",
    "their errors were derived taking into account the broadness of the cluster mss and , in the case of the cluster distances , the expression 0.46@xmath17[@xmath32(@xmath53 ) + 3.2@xmath17@xmath32@xmath12]@xmath17d , where @xmath32@xmath55 and @xmath32@xmath56 represent the estimated errors in @xmath53 and @xmath12 , respectively ( see , e.g. , clari et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the expressions @xmath48 = 1.97@xmath17@xmath12 and m@xmath49 = @xmath1 + 0.58@xmath17@xmath12 - ( v - m@xmath57 ) taken from @xcite were used to relate both color excesses and distance moduli .",
    "we also list in table 9 the galactocentric rectangular coordinates @xmath23,@xmath58,@xmath5 and the galactocentric distances @xmath59 of the clusters , derived assuming the sun s distance from the center of the galaxy to be 8.5 kpc .",
    "the adopted reference system is centered on the sun , with the @xmath23 and @xmath58-axes lying on the galactic plane and @xmath5 perpendicular to the plane .",
    "@xmath23 points towards the galactic center , being positive in the first and fourth quadrants ; @xmath58 points in the direction of the galactic rotation , being positive in the first and second galactic quadrants .",
    "@xmath5 is positive towards the north galactic pole .",
    "the 2mass catalog has been widely used to determine the fundamental parameters of hundreds of ocs ( see , e.g. , kronberger et al . , 2006 ; bonatto & bica 2007 ; tadross 2011 ) . the results obtained ,",
    "however , do not always yield consistent results with those derived using optical data . as shown by @xcite , the accuracy in determining the color excess @xmath60 using only 2mass",
    "is mainly limited by structural uncertainty in the ms and/or narrow range of magnitude sampling of the ms . from the observational point of view",
    ", the main reason for this discrepancy is the limiting magnitude , particularly for the oldest clusters , which reflects in the sampling of the ms , together with photometric errors .",
    "note that 2mass photometric errors typically reach 0.10 magnitudes at @xmath61 @xmath11 16.2 and @xmath62 @xmath11 15.0 @xcite , while in the optical bands ( @xmath63 or @xmath7 , for example ) , they are typically lower than 0.05 magnitudes at @xmath64 @xmath11 18.0 and @xmath1 @xmath11 19.0 . in the following subsections ,",
    "we compare the current results with those obtained in previous studies using 2mass .",
    "the equatorial coordinates we derived for the center of bh84 differ only by 33 \" in declination from the webda value ( table 1 ) .",
    "the radial number density profile of bh84 is shown in fig.4 , from which we derive a radius of 3.6 , slightly lower than the value reported by @xcite .",
    "the cluster ms is easily identifiable in fig .",
    "5 , extending along @xmath2 5 magnitudes and with clear evidence of some evolution .",
    "outer galactic disc stars remarkably contaminate the cluster ms , particularly its fainter half portion .",
    "the solar metallicity zams fitted to the cluster cmd yields a reddening @xmath48 = 1.25 @xmath14 0.10 , equivalent to @xmath12 = 0.63 @xmath14 0.05 , and a true distance modulus @xmath33@xmath65-m@xmath49 = 12.64 @xmath14 0.15 , which implies a distance of ( 3.37 @xmath14 0.48 ) kpc from the sun . for @xmath5",
    "= 0.019 , the best - fitting isochrone corresponds to an age of ( 560@xmath66 ) myr ( fig .",
    "therefore , bh84 , situated at 142 pc below the galactic plane and @xmath2 8.58 kpc from the galactic center ( table 9 ) , is found to be a cluster only slightly younger than the hyades .",
    "both the reddening and the distance here derived show a reasonable agreement with the results from 2mass data @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , however , the age we find is significantly larger than @xcite estimate of 18 myr .",
    "although some of the 2mass error must be due to the larger pixels , we believe the authors gross underestimation of bh84 age is clearly the result of the impossibility to see the turnoff point in the @xmath67 diagram .",
    "hence , @xcite derived the cluster s age just by fitting the zams .",
    "this appears to be a large cluster covering nearly the entire observed field ( fig.1 ) .",
    "we derived for ngc5381 practically the same equatorial coordinates as those listed in webda ( table 1 ) .",
    "it is difficult , however , to estimate the cluster radius from the stellar density radial profile ( fig .",
    "4 ) , because it does not present a typical cluster - like structure .",
    "if the area for @xmath30 @xmath68 1200 pixels is considered to be the `` star field area '' , then ngc5381 seems to have a relatively small but conspicuous nucleus and a low - density extended corona ( see also fig .",
    "1 ) . we estimate the angular core and corona radii as @xmath2 330 pixels ( @xmath2 2.2 ) and 870 pixels ( @xmath2 5.7 ) , respectively .",
    "3 reveals a crowded broad sequence of stars that traces the cluster ms along @xmath2 5 - 6 magnitudes and with clear signs of evolution .",
    "this fact suggests that the age of the cluster is some hundred million years .",
    "a number of stars visible in fig . 9 with @xmath1 magnitudes between 18 and 19 and @xmath34 colors ranging from 0.5 up to 1.5 magnitudes are clearly background stars .",
    "no clump of red stars is visible .",
    "however , the analysis of 2mass data by @xcite reveals that ngc5381 is an intermediate - age ( 1.6 gyr ) cluster , suffering low interstellar extinction .",
    "this is not confirmed by the current optical data .",
    "in fact , our best fit of the solar metallicity zams in the @xmath3 cmd yields @xmath48 = 0.90 @xmath14 0.08 , equivalent to @xmath12 = 0.46 @xmath14 0.04 , and a heliocentric distance of ( 2.63 @xmath14 0.40 ) kpc , while an age of about ( 250@xmath69 ) myr is derived from the best - fitting isochrone ( fig .",
    "therefore , ngc5381 now appears to be significantly younger than previously believed .",
    "the age difference between ours and @xcite may depend at least partially on the reddening difference .",
    "our reddening estimate , @xmath12 = 0.46 , is quite larger than the value of @xmath12 = 0.06 reported by @xcite .",
    "therefore , a smaller age value is obtained when a larger reddening value is adopted .",
    "ngc5381 lies at @xmath2 100 pc above the galactic plane and @xmath2 7.04 kpc from the galactic center ( table 9 ) .",
    "the coordinates for the cluster center derived in the current study differ by @xmath2 15 `` in right ascension and by only 3 '' in declination from the webda values ( table 1 ) . from the stellar density radial profile ( fig .",
    "4 ) , we determined the radius of bh211 to be @xmath2 3.9 , in very good agreement with the value reported by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 cmd obtained using all the measured stars in the cluster field is depicted in fig .",
    "3 , wherein the main cluster features can be identified .",
    "what first calls our attention is the cluster ms , which looks well populated , has clear signs of evolution and develops along @xmath2 5 - 6 magnitudes .",
    "it is relatively broad , especially in its lower envelope , partly due to field star contamination .",
    "another interesting feature of the @xmath3 cmd is the presence of a number of good candidates for giant clump stars centered at @xmath3 = ( 3.2,12.5 ) .",
    "since these stars lie within 400 pixels ( 2.6 ) from the cluster center , we may reasonably expect many of them to be cluster giants .",
    "the reddening and age we find , @xmath12 = 0.61 @xmath14 0.05 and @xmath2 ( 1000@xmath4 ) myr ( table 9 ) , turn out to be somewhat larger and lower , respectively , than @xcite estimates . in any case",
    ", there seems to be no doubt that bh211 is an intermediate - age cluster located at about ( 1.44 @xmath14 0.21 ) kpc from the sun , at scarcely @xmath2 12 pc out of the galactic plane and @xmath2 7.12 kpc from the galactic center ( table 8) .",
    "the equatorial coordinates we derived for this cluster are different by 15 `` in right ascension and by 36 '' in declination ( table 1 ) from the webda values .",
    "the radial number density profile of czernik37 is shown in fig .",
    "4 , from which we derived a radius of 3.6 , in good agreement with the value reported by @xcite .",
    "this cluster appears to be embedded in the dense stellar population towards the galactic bulge so that their properties are difficult to be determined . although the cluster cmd ( fig .",
    "3 ) is profusely contaminated by field stars , there is an appearance of a broad ms with evidence of some evolution .",
    "as mentioned in section 4 , the broadness of the ms of czernik37 is caused not only by field star contamination and other effects ( binarity , rotation , photometric errors , ets . ) but also by differential reddening .",
    "such effect is probably due to the presence of irregularly distributed dark clouds , projected towards the cluster .",
    "different isochrone fittings using @xmath5 = 0.019 in fig .",
    "9 allow us to estimate the variation range of @xmath48 as @xmath2 1.0 mag .",
    "the solar metallicity zams which best fits the cluster cmd ( fig .",
    "9 ) yields a reddening @xmath48 = 2.90 @xmath14 0.50 , equivalent to @xmath12 = 1.47 @xmath14 0.25 , and a true distance modulus @xmath33@xmath65- m@xmath49 = 10.80 @xmath14 0.50 . the isochrone corresponding to an age of ( 250@xmath70 ) myr reasonably reproduces the main cluster features in fig .",
    "9 . these results place czernik37 at a distance of ( 1.44 @xmath14 0.86 ) kpc from the sun and @xmath2 7.1 kpc from the galactic center ( table 9).the current cluster parameters exhibit a rather poor agreement with those derived by tadross ( 2008 ) from 2mass data . as in ngc5381 , our larger e(b - v ) value compared to that of tadross ( 2008 ) may partly explain our lower age estimate .",
    "we have presented new ccd washington @xmath7 photometry in the field of four galactic ocs projected onto the two inner quadrants of the galactic plane .",
    "these data were obtained with the main purpose of estimating the cluster fundamental astrophysical parameters .",
    "we performed a star count analysis of the cluster fields to assess the clusters reality as over - densities of stars with respect to the field and estimated the cluster radii .",
    "we determined the center of the clusters by finding the maximum surface number density of the stars in each cluster .",
    "new equatorial coordinates for the 2000.0 epoch are now provided .",
    "we outlined possible solutions for cluster fundamental parameters by matching theoretical isochrones , which reasonably reproduce the main cluster features in the @xmath3 cmds . in all cases ,",
    "the best fits were obtained using solar metallicity isochrones .",
    "bh211 was found to be the oldest object of our sample with an age of around 1.0 gyr .",
    "czernik37 , the most heavily reddened cluster of the sample , with a mean colour excess @xmath12 = 1.47 , is very likely affected by differential reddening .",
    "bh84 is located in the fourth galactic quadrant just before the tangent to the carina branch of the carina - sagittarius spiral arm .",
    "this cluster turned out to be much older than previously believed .",
    "conversely , ngc5381 was found to be much younger than previously reported .",
    "it appears to have a relatively small but conspicuous nucleus and a low - density extended corona .",

    "the derived fundamental properties for the studied clusters are listed in table 9 .",
