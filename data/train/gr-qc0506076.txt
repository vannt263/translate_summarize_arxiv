    "interesting alternative gravitational theories are the scalar - tensor gravitational theories , which appeared at the original paper of brans and dicke @xcite , where the newtonian constant @xmath1 was replaced by a scalar field @xmath2 , and the total action contained kinetic terms for the new field times an @xmath0 quantity . @xmath0 was regarded as a constant in the original paper .",
    "the theory was generalized in a series of papers , @xcite , mainly in the direction of replacing the constant @xmath0 with a function of the brans - dicke ( bd ) scalar field .",
    "boson stars appeared in the literature as stable field configurations of massive scalar matter with a global @xmath3 symmetry , coupled to gravity @xcite , now known as  mini \" boson stars due to their small relative magnitude .",
    "other works took into account self interactions @xcite or the case of local symmetry @xcite .",
    "their common feature is that gravity plays the role of the non - linear interaction that stabilizes the star against decay into free particles .    when the scalar potential is of a special type , admitting stable non - topological soliton solutions in the absence of gravity , the soliton stars appear as relativistic generalizations of the above solitons .",
    "the so called  large \" soliton stars , with radius of order of lightyears , discussed analytically in a series of papers by friedberg , lee and pang , @xcite .",
    "another class of soliton stars appeared as a generalization of q - balls .",
    "q - balls are non - topological solitons in lagrangians with a global @xmath3 symmetry , @xcite , or a local one , @xcite , or a global @xmath4 or @xmath5 symmetry , @xcite .",
    "q - balls are supposed to appear in the flat directions of the superpotential in supersymmetric extensions of standard model , @xcite , and play a special role in the baryogenesis , @xcite .",
    "q - stars are relativistic extensions of q - balls , with one or two scalar fields and a global , @xcite , or local , @xcite , @xmath3 symmetry , non - abelian symmetry , @xcite , or with fermions and a scalar field , @xcite in asymptotically flat or anti de sitter spacetime , @xcite .",
    "any type of the bosonic stars may offer a solution to the problem of dark matter , when the q - stars have the additional feature to be of the same order of magnitude as neutron stars and , generally , as other stellar objects .    within the bd gravitational framework , gunderson and jensen investigated the coupling of a scalar field with quartic self - interactions with the metric and the bd scalar field , @xmath2 , @xcite .",
    "the properties of boson stars within this framework have been extensively studied in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "their results generalized in scalar - tensor gravitational theories , where @xmath0 is no more a constant , but a function of the bd field @xcite .",
    "the case of charged boson - stars in a scalar - tensor gravitational theory has been analyzed in @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we follow the work of @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our aim is to study the formation of non - topological soliton stars in the context of bd or general scalar - tensor gravitational theory , their stability with respect to fission into free particles and to gravitational collapse , and the influence of @xmath0 in the star parameters .",
    "we also compare our results with those obtained in the framework of general relativity .",
    "we consider a static , spherically symmetric metric : @xmath6 with @xmath7 . in order to realize such a spacetime , we regard both the matter and the bd fields as spherically symmetric and the former with an harmonic time dependence , assuring minimum energy for the matter field , and the latter time independent . if @xmath8 is the matter field and @xmath2 the bd field , we write the action for the bd theory : @xmath9 with : @xmath10 and @xmath0 a constant in bd gravity and a certain function of the @xmath2 field in a generalized scalar - tensor gravitational theory , which we will discuss later .",
    "varying the action with respect to the metric and scalar fields we obtain the einstein and lagrange equations respectively , as follows : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 is the einstein tensor , @xmath15 the energy momentum tensor for the matter field given by : @xmath16 -g_{\\mu\\nu}u\\ ] ] and @xmath17 is the scalar curvature . tracing eq .",
    "[ 2.4 ] we take : @xmath18 with @xmath19 the trace of the energy - momentum tensor . substituting in eq .",
    "[ 2.6 ] we find : @xmath20 the above results hold true for every case of bosonic , spherically symmetric , static field configurations coupled to bd gravity",
    ".    we will now insert the q - soliton ansatz writing : @xmath21 with @xmath22 the frequency with which the q - soliton rotates within its internal @xmath3 space . the lagrange equation for the @xmath8 field",
    "is : @xmath23\\sigma'+ e^{\\lambda}\\omega^2e^{-\\nu}\\sigma - e^{\\lambda}\\frac{du}{d\\sigma^2}\\sigma=0\\ .\\ ] ] we define : @xmath24 @xmath25 and rescale : @xmath26 in roughly approximation , gravity becomes important when @xmath27 , where @xmath17 is defined as the radius , within which the matter field differs from zero , and @xmath28 is the mass trapped within this area . for the case of q - solitons",
    "the eigen - frequency is of the same order of magnitude as the mass and the absolute value of the scalar field : @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath30 is the energy density , then : @xmath31 . remembering that @xmath32",
    ", we find that for a q - star : @xmath33 so if we redefine : @xmath34 we expect @xmath35 .",
    "we also use a suitable rescaled potential , admitting q - ball type solutions in the absence of gravity , namely : @xmath36     for four different values of @xmath22 in a bd gravitational theory .",
    "@xmath22 gives a measure of the gravity strength at the surface , as it is related with the metrics at the surface of the star , through eq .",
    "[ 2.19 ] . ]     at the center of a q - star as a function of @xmath0 for four different values of @xmath22 in a bd gravitational theory . ]     for four different values of @xmath22 in a bd gravitational theory . ]     for four different values of @xmath22 in a bd gravitational theory . from figures [ figure1]-[figure4 ] , we see that small @xmath22 means a star with larger radius , mass and particle number . ]    dropping form now on the tildes , we will use the lagrange equation to find an analytical solution for the matter field .",
    "@xmath37 is a very small quantity for @xmath38 of the order of some ( hundreds ) @xmath39 , so ignoring the @xmath40 terms from the lagrange equation , we find : @xmath41 the surface is determined by the star radius .",
    "the radius of the solitonic configuration is defined as the radius within which the _ matter _ lagrangian differs from zero . outside this radius",
    "the matter lagrangian is zero , when the bd lagrangian _ may not necessarily be_. the surface width is of order of @xmath42 . within this ,",
    "the matter field varies very rapidly from a @xmath43 value at the inner edge of the surface , to zero at the outer , but the metric fields vary very slowly .",
    "so , dropping from the lagrange equation the @xmath40 terms we take : @xmath44 the above equation can be straightforward integrated and , because all energy quantities are zero at the outer edge of the surface , the result gives the following equation , holding true only within the surface : @xmath45 at the inner edge of the surface @xmath46 is zero in order to match the interior with the surface solution .",
    "so , at the inner edge of the surface the equality @xmath47 together with eq . [ 2.16 ] gives : @xmath48 eq . [ 2.19 ] is the eigenvalue equation for the frequency of the q - star , revealing the relation between a feature of the star and the spacetime curvature .    redefining : @xmath49 and dropping the @xmath40 terms , the lagrange equation for the bd field and the einstein equations",
    "take the form respectively : @xmath50= \\frac{2w-4u}{2\\omega_{\\textrm{bd}}+4}\\ , \\ ] ] @xmath51 @xmath52 with boundary conditions : @xmath53 where the first condition reflects the freedom to define the @xmath54 metric at least locally when the second arises from the flatness of the spacetime .",
    "one may alternatively , instead of eq .",
    "[ 2.22 ] , use the relation resulting from the schwarzschild formula : @xmath55 , which can be written with our rescalings as : @xmath56 with the new variable eq . [ 2.22 ] takes the form : @xmath57 with @xmath58 which reflects the absence of anomalies at the center of the star .",
    "the stability of the star results from a conserved noether charge .",
    "there is a noether current due to the global @xmath3 symmetry defined as : @xmath59 and a conserved noether charge defined as : @xmath60    in our figures @xmath17 is in @xmath61 units , the total mass in @xmath62 units and the charge in @xmath63 units .",
    "the total charge equals to the particle number if every single particle is assigned with a unity",
    " baryon \" number .",
    "the particle number also equals to the total energy of the free particles as their mass is taken to be unity .",
    "so , when the particle number exceeds the total mass , the star decays into free particles as the energetically favorable case .",
    "all the field configurations depicted in our figures are stable .",
    "an experimental lower limit for @xmath0 is @xmath64 , @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in the bd context coincide with general relativity when @xmath65 .",
    "we investigate the phase space of the star with @xmath0 varying between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , following the works of @xcite-@xcite , so as to explore thoroughly the influence of @xmath0 in the features of the star . as a general result",
    "we find that the star parameters , mass , particle number , radius and absolute value of the scalar field at the center of the star , increase when @xmath0 decreases .",
    "in the original bd gravitational theory @xmath0 is a constant . in a more general theory",
    "it may be regarded as a function , usually of the bd field .",
    "we will use one of the forms that barrow and parsons @xcite investigated in a cosmological framework namely : @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 constants .",
    "this form for @xmath0 gives an analytical solution , @xcite , for the metrics within the above mentioned cosmological framework .",
    "the lagrange equation for the bd field is : @xmath71 if we rescale : @xmath72 and the other quantities as in [ 2.13]-[2.14 ] eqs . and drop the tildes and the @xmath40 quantities we take for the einstein and the lagrange equation for the bd field : @xmath73 \\nonumber\\\\ -\\frac{\\omega_0\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}-3}{2}\\frac{a\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}'^2}{2\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}^2 } -\\frac{ab'\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}'}{2\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}b}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath74 \\nonumber\\\\+\\frac{\\omega_0\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}-3}{2}\\frac{a\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}'^2 } { 2\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}^2}+\\frac{a\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}''}{\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}}+ \\frac{a'\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}'}{2\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath75=\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\omega_0\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}+1 } \\left[2w-4u-\\frac{a\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}'^2}{2}\\frac{\\omega_0\\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}+1 } { \\phi_{\\textrm{bd}}}\\right]\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     for four different values of @xmath22 in a scalar - tensor gravitational theory with @xmath76 . ]     at the center of a q - star as a function of @xmath69 for four different values of @xmath22 in a scalar - tensor gravitational theory with @xmath76 . ]     for four different values of @xmath22 in a scalar - tensor gravitational theory with @xmath76 . ]     for four different values of @xmath22 in a scalar - tensor gravitational theory with @xmath76 . ]",
    "we solved the coupled einstein and and lagrange equations for several integral or half - integral values values of @xmath70 and found that the star parameters are rather constant .",
    "this owes to the @xmath77 relation , because @xmath69 and @xmath0 are not small enough so as to deviate considerably from the results of general relativity .",
    "when @xmath69 decreases the star parameters are larger than in the case of general relativity , and when @xmath78 its results are reproduced .",
    "we investigated q - stars in a bd gravitational theory .",
    "we also studied the case of q - stars in the framework of generalized scalar tensor theories , with @xmath0 a simple polynomial function of the bd scalar .",
    "all the field configurations discussed here are stable with respect to fission into free particles as the ratio of their energy to the energy of the free particles , equal to the mass of the free particles times the particle number , is smaller than unity .",
    "we investigated their properties , particle number , mass , radius of the matter field configuration and the value of the matter scalar field at the center of the star .",
    "the free parameters of their phase space are mainly the eigenfrequency , straightforwardly connected with the surface gravity , and the value of the @xmath0 or the @xmath69 for the generalized scalar - tensor theory .",
    "we found that the star parameters , mass , particle number , radius and absolute value at the center , are in generally larger when @xmath0 or @xmath69 is small and coincide with the results of general relativity when @xmath79 .",
