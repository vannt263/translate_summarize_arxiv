    "the detection of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) neutrinos at the icecube  @xcite has opened a new window on the universe . in the 4-year dataset , 54 uhe neutrino events",
    "have been observed , which constitute a @xmath1 excess over the expected atmospheric background  @xcite .",
    "it is imperative for both astrophysics and particle physics communities to understand all possible aspects of these uhe neutrino events reported by the icecube collaboration . from the astrophysics side",
    ", one needs to identify the possible extraterrestrial source(s )  @xcite , and the underlying spectral shape  @xcite and flavor composition  @xcite , of the neutrino flux . from a particle physics point of view",
    ", one can use this as a unique opportunity to test the standard model ( sm ) at energy scales that are otherwise not achievable on earth  @xcite .",
    "so far , no statistically significant deviations from the sm prediction have been found in the icecube data  @xcite , although many new physics scenarios have been envisaged ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) to explain some peculiar features . with more statistics ,",
    "if the data remains consistent with the sm predictions , one can put useful , complementary constraints on various new physics scenarios . anticipating this , we examine the current and future prospects of a well - motivated new physics scenario , namely , @xmath0-parity violating ( rpv ) supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite , at the icecube and beyond .",
    "the susy extension of the sm has many attractive features to qualify arguably as the best motivated candidate for the new physics  @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of evidence for superpartners in the lhc data so far  @xcite has forced the simplest susy scenarios toward regions of parameter space unnatural for the higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "a simple way to preserve the higgs naturalness by evading the current experimental constraints is by allowing rpv in the production and decays of superpartners  @xcite .",
    "apart from significantly lowering the collider bounds on the susy spectrum  @xcite , rpv susy implies the violation of baryon and/or lepton numbers , which has important phenomenological consequences  @xcite .",
    "for instance , one can automatically generate non - zero neutrino masses and mixing   at either tree or one - loop level without introducing any extra particles beyond the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) field content .",
    "similarly , the presence of @xmath2 rpv vertices can lead to observable neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath3 )  @xcite , as well as successful baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "moreover , rpv scenarios also provide a viable explanation for a number of recent @xmath4 to @xmath5 anomalies , e.g. muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite , in semileptonic @xmath6-meson  @xcite and lepton - flavor - violating higgs  @xcite decays , cms @xmath7 and @xmath8 excesses  @xcite , atlas diboson excess  @xcite , and the lhc diphoton excess  @xcite .",
    "if any of these anomalies persist and become statistically more significant , one should consider rpv susy as a strong contender for the underlying new physics . in any case , it is of paramount importance to find complementary ways at as many different energy scales as possible to test this scenario .",
    "the most general rpv superpotential in the mssm is @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the @xmath12-doublet and @xmath13 are the @xmath12-singlet chiral superfields , respectively ( with @xmath14 being the generation indices ) and @xmath15 is the up - type higgs superfield .",
    "here we have suppressed all gauge indices for brevity . @xmath12 and @xmath16 gauge invariance enforce antisymmetry of the @xmath17- and @xmath18-couplings with respect to their first and last two indices , respectively .",
    "since we are interested in the uhe neutrino interactions with nucleons , we will only focus on the @xmath19-couplings .",
    "any of these 27 new dimensionless complex parameters can lead to resonant production of tev - scale squarks at icecube energies  @xcite , thereby making a potentially significant contribution to the uhe neutrino events .",
    "note that even without susy , similar resonance features in neutrino - nucleon interactions can also occur in models with tev - scale leptoquarks  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20-couplings in eq .   can give rise to resonant production of selectrons from neutrino interactions with electrons , reminiscent of the glashow resonance  @xcite in the sm ; however , for tev - scale selectrons , their contribution to the total number of icecube events is negligible in the energy range considered here and we will comment on this possibility later . note that with non - zero @xmath21-couplings , we need to explicitly forbid the @xmath22-terms , e.g.  by imposing baryon triality  @xcite , to avoid rapid proton decay  @xcite .",
    "we also ignore the bilinear terms in eq .",
    ", since they do not give rise to the resonance feature exploited here .",
    "neutrino telescopes  @xcite . ]",
    "using the fact that for a given power - law astrophysical neutrino flux , there is no statistically significant resonance - like feature in the current icecube high - energy starting event ( hese ) data , we derive robust upper limits on the rpv couplings @xmath23 as a function of the resonantly - produced down - type squark mass @xmath24 , independent of the other susy parameters , provided the squarks decay dominantly through their rpv couplings . with the currently available low statistics of the icecube hese data , our bounds turn out to be weaker than the existing indirect constraints  @xcite from precision measurements in various low - energy processes .",
    "however , with more data pouring in from icecube , and with the possibility of a second km@xmath25 detector , such as km3net  @xcite , and even a multi - km@xmath25 extension , such as icecube - gen2  @xcite , our projected future limits could be comparable to the existing ones and complementary to the direct probes of the @xmath21-type rpv susy at the lhc  @xcite , as well as other indirect searches at future low - energy neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "this should provide yet another science motivation for the next - generation neutrino telescopes , or at least should allow for an independent test of a possible finding in the lhc or other experiments .",

    "there seems to be another excess just above 1 pev , which is however difficult to explain in this scenario , since this would require a squark mass above tev , for which the production cross section is already small .",
    "moreover , since the neutrino flux has a strong power - law dependence of @xmath96 , the resulting number of events in the higher - energy bins will be further suppressed , thus requiring a non - perturbative value of @xmath92 to fit any pev - excess .",

    "the corresponding 95% cl atlas limit of 900 gev on the first - generation scalar leptoquark mass can be directly translated into a lower bound on the down - type squark mass , as shown by the vertical dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "there also exist indirect constraints on @xmath92 from lepton universality in pion decay , measured by the ratio @xmath131 , unitarity of the ckm element @xmath132 and atomic parity violation  @xcite , the most stringent of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) by the red dotted curve .",
    "other low - energy constraints , such as neutrino mass  @xcite , electric dipole moment  @xcite and flavor - changing @xmath6-decays  @xcite , always involve the product of two independent rpv couplings , and hence , are not applicable in our case .",
    "moreover , for @xmath97 , we have an additional constraint from @xmath3 , as discussed in the previous section , which however depends on the masses of other susy particles , unlike the other limits discussed above , which are independent of the rest of the susy spectrum , as long as the 2-body rpv decay modes of the squark are dominant . just for the sake of comparison",
    ", we show the @xmath3 limits in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) for two benchmark points with @xmath133 tev ( gray , dashed ) and 10 pev ( gray , dotted ) , while keeping all sfermion masses equal to @xmath134 . in the former case , the @xmath3 limit is the most stringent one , whereas for either heavier gaugino masses or @xmath135 , the pion decay constraint is stronger than the limit obtained from icecube in the entire mass range considered .",
    "similarly , as shown in fig .  [ fig4](b ) , for @xmath123 , the indirect constraints from lepton universality in neutral and charged @xmath136-meson decays , measured by the ratio @xmath137 , are stronger than the icecube limit derived here .",
    "this rules out the possibility of any @xmath138-induced observable excess in the 4-year icecube data .",
    "however , one should note that these are the first - ever icecube constraints on rpv couplings , and at present , are mostly limited by statistics , which is expected to improve significantly with more exposure time . to illustrate this point , we just scale the current 4-year dataset by a factor of 4 ( roughly corresponding to 15 years of actual data taking ) in all the bins analyzed here and derive projected limits on @xmath138 ( with @xmath139 ) , following the same likelihood procedure described above .",
    "this conservative estimate of the future limits is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] by the blue dashed curves .",
    "we find that the limit on @xmath138 can be improved roughly by up to a factor of 3 with 15-yr icecube data , and it might even surpass the current best limit in the sub - tev squark mass range for @xmath140 , although the indirect limit from lepton universality could improve by an order of magnitude in a future super - tau - charm factory  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "however , we may not have to wait for 15 years , since a number of unforeseen factors could improve the conservative projected icecube limits shown here , e.g. the future data in all the bins may not scale proportionately to the current data and may turn out to be in better agreement with the sm prediction . similarly , other large - volume detectors like km3net and icecube - gen2 might go online at some point , thus significantly increasing the total statistics .",
    "we also note that a similar analysis could be performed for incident neutrinos of muon and tau flavors at icecube , though for muon neutrinos , one has to carefully reassess the atmospheric background including the rpv effects .",
    "however , we expect the corresponding limits on @xmath23 ( with @xmath141 and @xmath139 ) to be weaker than the limits on @xmath138 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] simply due to the fact that the effective fiducial volume at the icecube is the largest for @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , with more statistics , one could in principle consider the @xmath23 couplings for all neutrino flavors .",
    "also , one could improve the analysis presented here by taking into account the showers and tracks individually . since the @xmath138 couplings preferentially enhance _ only _ one type of events , viz .",
    "showers for @xmath142 and tracks for @xmath143 , a binned track - to - shower ratio analysis is expected to improve the limits on the corresponding @xmath23 . in fact , by examining the track - to - shower ratio in future data , one might be able to distinguish between different new physics contributions to the icecube events , provided the source flavor composition of the neutrinos is known more accurately .    before concluding , we would like to make a comment on the @xmath20-couplings in eq .",
    ", which leads to the @xmath144-type rpv lagrangian @xmath145+{\\rm h.c.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this will give rise to a selectron resonance from ( anti)neutrino  electron interactions at icecube .",
    "however , the corresponding threshold energy @xmath146 is beyond 10 pev for selectron masses above 100 gev or so .",
    "since smaller selectron masses are excluded from the lep data  @xcite , we can not probe the @xmath17-couplings with the current icecube data .",
    "nevertheless , if future data reports any events beyond 10 pev , the @xmath144-type rpv scenario could in principle provide a viable explanation , given the fact that it would be difficult to explain those events within the sm and with an unbroken power - law flux , without having a significantly larger number of events in all the preceding lower - energy bins .",
    "rpv susy is a well - motivated candidate for tev - scale new physics beyond the sm , while being consistent with the null results at the lhc so far .",
    "therefore , it is important to test this hypothesis at different energy scales available to us . using the 4-year icecube hese data in the multi tev - pev range ,",
    "we have derived the first icecube upper limits on the rpv couplings @xmath23 as a function of the mass of the resonantly - produced down - type squarks ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "although weaker than the existing limits from low - energy processes , our limits are expected to be significantly improved with more statistics in future , thereby complementing the rpv susy searches at the energy and intensity frontiers .",
