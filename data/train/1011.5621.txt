    "<S> we propose a theoretical scheme to generate a controllable and switchable coupling between two double - quantum - dot ( dqd ) spin qubits by using a transmission line resonator ( tlr ) as a bus system . </S>",
    "<S> we study dynamical behaviors of quantum correlations described by entanglement correlation ( ec ) and discord correlation ( dc ) between two dqd spin qubits when the two spin qubits and the tlr are initially prepared in @xmath0-type quantum states and a coherent state , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that in the ec death regions there exist dc stationary states in which the stable dc amplification or degradation can be generated during the dynamical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that these dc stationary states can be controlled by initial - state parameters , the coupling , and detuning between qubits and the tlr . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal the full synchronization and anti - synchronization phenomena in the ec and dc time evolution , and show that the ec and dc synchronization and anti - synchronization depends on the initial - state parameters of the two dqd spin qubits . </S>",
    "<S> these results shed new light on dynamics of quantum correlations . </S>"
