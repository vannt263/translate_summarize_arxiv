    "in the last decade , intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) , or discrete breathers ( dbs ) as they are also termed , have become a topic of intense theoretical and experimental investigation ; see e.g. , @xcite for a number of recent reviews on the topic . per their inherent ability to bottleneck and potentially transport the energy in a coherent fashion , such exponentially localized in space and periodic in time entities",
    "have have come to be of interest in a variety of contexts . these range from nonlinear optics and arrays of waveguides @xcite to bose - einstein condensates inside optical lattice potentials @xcite and from prototypical models of nonlinear springs @xcite to josephson junctions @xcite and dynamical models of the dna double strand @xcite .",
    "one of the playgrounds that have most recently been added to this long list of ilm applications consists of nonlinear photonic crystal waveguides and circuits @xcite . in connection to this context ,",
    "an issue that becomes very relevant ( see e.g. the models developed in @xcite ) is the interplay of nonlinearity and geometry as , typically in photonic crystal waveguide arrays , two - dimensional or quasi - one dimensional settings with bends @xcite become relevant .",
    "we should note here that the interplay of nonlinearity and geometry has been increasingly appreciated in the ilm literature . from the long range interactions on a fixed curved substrate @xcite , to lattice - substrate feedback models @xcite and from lattice junctions with different masses @xcite , to semi - circular",
    ", polymer - like chains @xcite and geometrically motivated , bent models of dna @xcite , the geometry can significantly affect the static ( inducing e.g. , multi - stability ) and dynamic ( causing e.g. , a variety of outcomes in the ilm interaction with curvature ) properties of the relevant lattice model .",
    "in the present work , motivated by these studies we examine the nonlinear klein - gordon variant of a model introduced recently in the context of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) in @xcite .",
    "this is a prototypical model emulating the geometry of a lattice bend , by the inclusion in the vicinity of the bend of next - nearest neighbor interaction due to the proximity of these neighbors in this context ( see e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fign1 ] ) .    ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 stands for the bend - induced interaction between the next - nearest neighbors ( in the vicinity of the bend ) , whereas @xmath1 represents the nearest neighbor interaction in the rectilinear chain . ]",
    "we will examine this bend in the framework of a soft and a hard klein - gordon interaction potential , namely the morse and the hard @xmath2 potentials respectively .",
    "apart from the inherent interest of the interaction , at the static as well as dynamical level , of discrete breathers with the `` geometric impurity '' induced by the bend , the model may be relevant to a number of applications .",
    "in particular , the dnls serves as the envelope wave equation ( at the discrete level ) for maxwell s equation , hence , for the photonic applications , it may be of more interest to identify the properties of the corresponding klein - gordon model . furthermore , this may also serve as a simple dynamical model for understanding the interaction of a denaturation bubble in dna @xcite with the local helical geometry of the double strand .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the earlier study of @xcite , where the helicoidal geometry was argued to induce a non - nearest neighbor interaction across the double strand .",
    "notice , also , that we follow a slightly different path than @xcite , by examining not only static but also dynamic properties of the model and , in particular , the potential outcomes of the breather - bend interaction .    in the next section",
    ", we will present the model equation of interest , while in section 3 , we will study its linear modes . in section 4 , we will examine the static properties of the two models , by examining the bifurcations of breathing modes as a function of the `` bend parameter '' @xmath0 . in section 5 , the corresponding dynamics properties of the breather - bend interaction will be presented .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "in accordance with the above description , the hamiltonian of the klein  gordon chains of interest will be given by :    @xmath3    thus the bending point is located at the particle @xmath4 and implies , as is graphically indicated in fig .",
    "[ fign1 ] , a geometrically induced coupling of next - nearest neighbors ( nnn ) adjacent to the bend site .",
    "we should clarify here the nature of the configuration and of the dynamics .",
    "the displacements @xmath5 represent an `` external '' field such as e.g. , the electric field in a array of optical waveguides or the stretching of a base pair in a dna chain @xcite .",
    "the chain of fig .",
    "[ fign1 ] should be considered as being geometrically _ fixed _ on the plane of the paper .",
    "the dynamics of the displacements is transverse , i.e. , perpendicular to the plane of the bent chain .",
    "in such a setting the coefficient of the interaction between adjacent sites is determined by the ( fixed ) geometric proximity of the nodes constituting the chain . for a derivation of the discrete model in the first setting and an explanation of the dependence of the interaction coefficient on the geometry of the configuration and the inter - nodal distance ,",
    "see e.g. , @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is natural to assume that the effect of the bend ( due to the geometric proximity of sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) will be to induce the nnn coupling between them ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath8 is the on  site potential which is chosen to be of the ( soft ) morse type , @xmath9 or of the ( hard ) @xmath2 type , @xmath10 ; @xmath1 is a coupling constant between nearest neighbors ( nn ) whose interaction will be harmonic ( i.e. , connected by linear springs ) for the purposes of the present work .    from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) , the following dynamical equations can be obtained :    @xmath11=0.\\ ] ]    a natural bifurcation / continuation parameter that we will use for the purposes of our study is @xmath12 .",
    "the relevant ratio is a natural measure of the relative strength of the different neighbor interactions ( the bend - based nnn one and the uniformly distributed nn one ) .",
    "this ratio can also be interpreted geometrically ( in the sprit of fig .",
    "[ fign1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , it can be related to the wedge angle @xmath13 through the relation : @xmath14 . for the nnn approximation to be realistic",
    ", @xmath13 must be larger than @xmath15 , hence , equivalently , @xmath16 .",
    "notice that while the geometric interpretation of the moment prompts us to typically examine the regime of @xmath17 $ ] , it is of inherent mathematical interest to examine broader parameter ranges , and therefore some of our results below will be presented for values of @xmath18 outside this range .",
    "some of the properties of discrete breathers are related to the existence or non - existence of linear localized modes .",
    "these modes appear as the bend is introduced by modifying the coupling , which is effectively equivalent to the introduction of an inhomogeneity in the curvature at the bottom of the inter - site potential @xcite .",
    "the linear modes can be obtained from the linearized form ( around the uniform state @xmath19 ) of the dynamical equations ( [ eq : dyn ] ) :    @xmath20=0,\\ ] ]    with @xmath21 .",
    "the linear modes can be calculated using the lattice green s function @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the localized linear modes ( also referred to as _ impurity modes _ ) is thus given by :    @xmath22    and the inhomogeneity parameter is related to the frequency of the impurity modes through the relation :    @xmath23    where the plus sign corresponds to @xmath24 and the minus sign to @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig : linear ] shows the frequencies of the linear modes as a function of @xmath26 and the profile of the impurity modes .",
    "it can be observed that , for @xmath27 the impurity mode is above the phonon band and , in consequence , has a zigzag vibrational pattern ( i.e. , a staggered mode ) . if @xmath28 , the mode is below the band and its sites oscillate in phase @xcite .",
    "it is worth remarking that the impurity modes are anti - symmetric modes whose central lattice site is at rest .",
    "cc +   for a coupling constant @xmath29 .",
    "( bottom ) profile of the impurity mode for @xmath30 ( left ) or @xmath31 ( right ) and @xmath32 .",
    "note that the localization of the impurity modes is non - negligible only for high values of @xmath18.,title=\"fig : \" ] &   for a coupling constant @xmath29 .",
    "( bottom ) profile of the impurity mode for @xmath30 ( left ) or @xmath31 ( right ) and @xmath32 .",
    "note that the localization of the impurity modes is non - negligible only for high values of @xmath18.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "discrete breathers can be calculated using well - known techniques based on the concept of continuation from the anti - continuous limit @xcite . furthermore , since the bending acts as an inhomogeneity , the system has lost its integer shift invariance and the properties of the breathers critically depend on the site where their center is located ( at @xmath33 ) .",
    "this fact leads to the existence of saddle - node bifurcations through which some of the solutions can disappear .",
    "similar bifurcations have been previously observed in bent chains of oscillators @xcite .",
    "this has also been the main focus , for dnls type settings , of @xcite .",
    "these bifurcations need a relatively high value of the coupling ( sufficient cross - talk between the neighboring sites ) to be observed .",
    "otherwise , breather solutions will exist for very large intervals of @xmath0 in every site of the lattice .",
    "hence we restrict ourselves to @xmath1 s of the order of ( typically ) @xmath34 to render these bifurcations tractable .",
    "we now proceed to examine the bifurcation diagrams ( as a function of @xmath18 ) for both soft and hard on - site potentials and a harmonic inter - site potential .",
    "figure [ fig : bifmorse ] shows the bifurcation diagrams for the case of a morse on  site potential and couplings @xmath35 and @xmath36 and frequency @xmath37 , and figure [ fig : brmorse ] shows the spatial profile of the solutions corresponding to a number of branches for @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath35 , the branch corresponding to the breathers centered at @xmath4 merges with the breathers originally centered at @xmath39 at @xmath40 .",
    "the branches centered at @xmath41 and @xmath42 disappear through a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath43 .",
    "this phenomenon is also observed for the branches centered at @xmath44 and @xmath45 at @xmath46 . for @xmath31",
    "the annihilations are observed between different branches of solutions .",
    "in particular , the branches centered at @xmath39 and @xmath6 annihilate at @xmath47 and the ones centered at @xmath42 and @xmath44 cease to exist through the saddle - node bifurcation occurring at @xmath48 .",
    "it should , however , be noted that some branches ( see e.g. , the branch centered at @xmath6 for @xmath30 or the one centered @xmath49 for @xmath31 ) never annihilate .",
    "it is also interesting to note that all of these branches of solutions are unstable , as both site - centered and bond - centered breathers are unstable in the straight chain ( for this value of the nn coupling ) .",
    "however , the branch resulting when the centered at @xmath4 and @xmath39 merge is stable .",
    "the branch centered at @xmath41 becomes stable for @xmath50 .",
    "this change of stability has its origin in a pair of floquet multipliers that collide in the unit circle at @xmath51 .",
    "notice that this behavior , unlike the typical branches discussed above does not involve a saddle - node bifurcation ( or for that matter an exchange of stability with another static breather branch ) .",
    "for @xmath36 the saddle - node bifurcations occur between different solutions from the case considered above . for @xmath30 ,",
    "the branches centered at @xmath39 and @xmath6 collide and disappear at @xmath52 ; the branches centered at @xmath42 and @xmath44 cease to exist at @xmath53 while the ones centered at @xmath45 and @xmath54 terminate at @xmath55 .",
    "the branch centered at @xmath4 merges with the branch centered at @xmath39 for @xmath31 and in particular for @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , the branches centered at @xmath41 and @xmath42 annihilate at @xmath57 and the ones centered at @xmath44 and @xmath45 collide at @xmath58 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that similarly to what was found in @xcite , in a different setting , there is an asymmetric mode that persists for @xmath59 , whose energy is lower than the symmetric bend mode .",
    "hence , for @xmath31 in this case , we observe a symmetry breaking effect that leads to an asymmetric ground state of the system .",
    "notice that similar asymmetric modes can be found ( and identified to be potentially stable ) in continuum models with localized impurities ; see e.g. , @xcite .    .",
    "the coupling constant is @xmath35 ( top ) or @xmath36 ( bottom ) .",
    "the numbers indicate the site where the solutions are centered ; an integer number corresponds to a site - centered solution , whereas a half - integer number corresponds to a bond - centered solution .",
    "stable solutions ( for an infinite system ) are represented by full lines whereas unstable solutions are represented by dashed lines.,title=\"fig : \" ] + .",
    "the coupling constant is @xmath35 ( top ) or @xmath36 ( bottom ) .",
    "the numbers indicate the site where the solutions are centered ; an integer number corresponds to a site - centered solution , whereas a half - integer number corresponds to a bond - centered solution .",
    "stable solutions ( for an infinite system ) are represented by full lines whereas unstable solutions are represented by dashed lines.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this communication , we have introduced a discrete klein - gordon chain model variant , emulating the existence of a geometric bend at a lattice site .",
    "we have examined the static properties of the localized in space , time periodic solutions that exist in this setting , starting from the limit where the chain is rectilinear . in the latter case , from the integer shift invariance and numerous earlier studies @xcite , we know that site - centered and bond - centered solutions will exist and their stability can be established .",
    "hence , using continuation from the `` straight '' limit into the `` bent '' regime , we are able to trace the branches of corresponding solutions and identify their saddle - node bifurcations leading to the termination of the corresponding branches .",
    "however , we have also identified symmetry breaking effects in which one of the asymmetric branches does _ not _ collide with one of its neighboring counterparts to terminate its existence , but rather survives throughout the bend - parameter strength continuation , and becomes the lowest energy state of the lattice .",
    "excitation of unstable bend modes in such cases will lead to trapping around ( i.e. , _ switching to _ ) such an asymmetric state , but in the presence of pinning modes , moving breathers may result .",
    "hence , we conclude that sufficiently strong bends may favor an asymmetric localization of energy , with respect to the bend center .",
    "we have also studied the dynamic properties of the interaction of such bends with moving localized modes , when the latter are scattered off of a bend .",
    "we have found that for soft potentials , the bend operates as a potential barrier allowing transmission for supercritical and reflection for subcritical values of the localized excitation s initial speed .",
    "however , there can also be narrow intervals of trapping ( not captured by the potential barrier picture ) .",
    "on the other hand , for hard potentials , a more complex and partly initial condition ( i.e. , kinetic energy ) dependent picture emerges . for small bend strengths , the inhomogeneity acts as a potential well , but for higher ones it can lead to trapping and even to reflection .    in this numerical study , we have mainly aimed at presenting the relevant phenomenology , classifying it for klein - gordon chains with different potentials , and providing a qualitative explanation of the relevant findings .",
    "it would naturally be of interest to attempt to obtain more quantitative , theoretically predicted , estimates for the transitions observed herein .",
    "a variational viewpoint may prove to be useful in this context .",
