    "bit cumulants offer a convenient characterization of the fluctuating bit numbers of probability distributions generated by chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "especially , the second bit cumulant which measures variance of bit number , is equivalent to heat capacity in the thermodynamic analogy .",
    "this quantity is also helpful to discuss sensitivity to correlations among subsystems @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to generalize the bit cumulants within nonextensive thermostatistics of tsallis @xcite .",
    "the latter formalism is based on a non - logarithmic entropy s_q= , where @xmath0 is a measure of nonextensivity of the entropy _ i.e. _ its feature of non - additivity with respect to entropies of statistically independent subsystems . based on the idea of q - deformed bit numbers @xcite ,",
    "tsallis entropy can be written in two equivalent forms s_q=-_i=1^w [ a_i]p_i = _ i=1^w[b_i]p_i^q , [ 2 ] where @xmath1 is the bit number and @xmath2=\\frac{q^x-1}{q-1}$ ] . as @xmath3 , @xmath2\\rightarrow x$ ] and @xmath4 , the shannon entropy .",
    "thermostatistics based on this formalism obeys the legendre transform structure of the standard formalism @xcite . apart from this ,",
    "various ( in)equalities of thermodynamics are properly generalized or are left invariant with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "tsallis formalism has found a number of significant applications , such as stellar polytropes @xcite , two - dimensional pure electron plasma turbulence @xcite , solar neutrinos @xcite , anomalous diffusion @xcite , dynamical response theory @xcite , to name only a few .",
    "these systems are characterized by one of the following : long range interactions , long term memory effects or multifractal - like phase space .",
    "particularly , tsallis formalism has yielded important insights into low - dimensional dissipative systems at the onset of chaos or at bifurcation points @xcite .",
    "recently , a nonextensive thermostatistics based on multifractal formalism was developed by the authors which related degree of nonextensivity @xmath6 to the precision of a calculation @xcite .",
    "thus there is relevance to discuss the alternative tool of bit cumulants within nonextensive approach .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly discuss the standard bit cumulants . in section iii , we present generalized version of bit cumulants and apply the first and second cumulant to logistic - like family of maps .",
    "section iv concludes the study .",
    "bit cumulants @xmath7 of order @xmath8 are defined via a generating function g()=ln(_i p_iexp(-a_i))= _ k=0^ ( ) _ k. alternatively , we can write _ k = g ( ) _ = 0 .",
    "the zeroth cumulant is zero .",
    "the first cumulant @xmath9 is shannon entropy @xmath10 , of the distribution @xmath11 .",
    "the second cumulant is variance of the bit number _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath12 . from thermodynamics point of view , @xmath13 is of major importance .",
    "an important property of @xmath7 is that it is additive with respect to statistically independent systems or subsystems .",
    "thus for a composite system @xmath14 whose joint probabilities factorize as : @xmath15,we have @xmath16 .",
    "this may be taken as _ extensive _ feature of the standard bit cumulants .",
    "we have seen ( eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) ) that within tsallis thermostatistics , the generalized bit - number is given by @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "thus we define the new generating function of bit cumulants as g^(q)()=ln(_i p_i exp(-))= _ k=0^ ( ) _ k^(q ) .",
    "the generalized bit cumulant may be defined as _",
    "k^(q ) = g^(q ) ( ) _ = 0 .",
    "it is easy to see that the first cumulant is tsallis entropy @xmath18>$ ] .",
    "the second cumulant is the variance of the generalized bit number @xmath17 $ ] , and is given by _",
    "2^(q)= < [ a_i]^2 > -<[a_i]>^2 [ biv ] .",
    "alternately , in terms of the bit number @xmath19 $ ] ( eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) ) , one can write @xmath20 ^ 2 p_i^{(2q-1)}-\\left(\\sum_i[b_i ] p_i^q\\right)^2 $ ] .",
    "note that it is also possible to obtain the second cumulant , by defining a generalized free energy @xmath21 @xcite and using the relation @xmath22 such that _ 2^(q)= q\\{^2 p_i^(2q-1)-(_i[b_i ] p_i^q)^2}. [ sbc ] thus the two cumulants differ only by factor of @xmath5 . in the following , we will apply eq .",
    "( [ sbc ] ) , as it is related to the general thermodynamic framework as established in @xcite .    an important distinctive feature of the new cumulants is that they are non - additive ( nonextensive ) with respect to independent subsystems . in this paper , we apply the first and second generalized cumulants to the study of chaotic systems , such as logistic map and logistic - like family of maps .",
    "as said above , the first generalized bit cumulant is tsallis entropy @xmath23 itself . for an ergodic map , we write @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the natural invariant density of the map . consider the standard logistic map @xmath26 , @xmath27 $ ] , which is chaotic above @xmath28 . as fig .",
    "1 shows , for @xmath29 with decrease in box size @xmath30 , tsallis entropy shows a corresponding increase .",
    "this behaviour is comparable to that shown in fig . 2 by shannon entropy @xmath31 ,",
    "although at a given parameter value @xmath32 , and for @xmath29 , @xmath33 , at the same box size .",
    "this latter feature is already known for an equiprobability distribution @xcite , but here it is shown for a nonuniform distribution such as generated by logistic map .",
    "moreover , tsallis entropy provides notable variation with respect to @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for @xmath29 ,",
    "as @xmath6 increases , @xmath23 also shows an increase .",
    "thus results of fig . 1 and fig .",
    "3 suggest an interesting possibility .",
    "tsallis entropy evaluated at smaller box size and small @xmath6 can be matched by the value of entropy at large box size and large @xmath6 value .",
    "in other words , for a given value of tsallis entropy , there can be a range of @xmath6 and box size values @xmath30 and it is interesting to see the relation between the two . for concreteness , we chose a fixed @xmath32 value and evaluate @xmath23 at some box size and given @xmath5 value .",
    "then we keep @xmath23 fixed to within good approximation and plot the corresponding @xmath34 and @xmath35 values in fig .",
    "4 . note that @xmath36 is the volume parameter in thermodynamic analogy @xcite .",
    "thus thermodynamic limit @xmath37 is equivalent to @xmath38 .",
    "the direct proportionality between @xmath6 and @xmath39 plays important role in the nonextensive formalism for chaotic systems @xcite .      in the canonical framework , second cumulant is equivalent to heat capacity . in the following ,",
    "we make a detailed study of generalized second cumulants . in terms of probabilities",
    "@xmath40 , we can write eq . ( [ sbc ] ) as _ 2^(q ) = \\{_i p_i^2q-1 -(p_i^q)^2 } [ biv2 ] .",
    "@xmath41 goes to second bit cumulant , @xmath42 as @xmath3 .    to discuss non - additive property of @xmath43 ,",
    "consider again a composite system ( i+ii ) , for which @xmath44 . then _",
    "2^(q)(i+ii ) & = & _ 2^(q)(i)+ _ 2^(q)(ii ) + & & -2(1-q)\\{_2^(q)(i)<[a_j]>_ii + _ 2^(q)(ii)<[a_i]>_i } + & & + q(1-q)^2\\ { <",
    "[ a_i]^2>_i _ ii -<[a_i]>_i^2 _ ii^2}.the non - additive feature also indicates correlations among subsystems i and ii when @xmath45 .",
    "now for ergodic maps , based on eq .",
    "( [ biv2 ] ) we propose the generalized bit variance density or heat capacity given by ^(q)= ( < ^(2q-1 ) > -<^ q > ^2 ) [ a ] . for @xmath3",

    "( [ a ] ) for logistic - like family of maps .",
    "these are given by @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "especially for @xmath51 , we have standard logistic map in its centered representation . fig .",
    "5 shows both @xmath52 and @xmath53 vs. @xmath54 for @xmath51 .",
    "it appears there is a kind of scaling factor between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "to check this , we plot @xmath52 vs. @xmath53 in fig . 6 and note that most of the points can be fitted to a straight line .",
    "one can ask how this relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 depends on the nature of map . in fig . 7 , we show results for different @xmath55 values .",
    "the scaling factor between @xmath53 and @xmath52 which is measured by the slope of straight line fits to the graphs such as fig .",
    "6 , shows a monotonic decrease with increasing @xmath55 value ( fig .",
    "in other words , the deviation of the slope from unity decreases with increase in @xmath55 value , _",
    "i.e. _ the function @xmath53 is _ less sensitive _ to @xmath5 for higher values of @xmath55 .",
    "alternatively , for a given map ( fixed @xmath55 value ) , one can enquire how the above mentioned slope changes with @xmath5 . naturally for @xmath56 , @xmath57 and the slope tends to unity .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "we have generalized the bit cumulants within nonextensive approach . in this paper , we have concentrated on properties of first and second bit cumulants .",
    "we have seen how keeping tsallis entropy ( first cumulant ) constant , we get a connection between box size ( which represents precision of a calculation ) and degree of nonextensivity @xmath34 .",
    "secondly , we have done detailed study on second bit cumulant applying it to logistic - like family of maps .",
    "we note that for large @xmath55 , @xmath57 . in the light of this",
    ", we would like to point out a feature seen in studies on sensitivity to initial conditions in similar systems @xcite .",
