    "2003 ; dinescu et al .",
    "2011 ) of the thick disk in comparison with the thin disk have long been considered to provide constraints on the formation models of the thick disk .",
    "theoretical models for the formation of the galaxy based on a cold dark matter cosmology have started to explore the origin of the observed complicated nature of the thick disk ( e.g. , abadi et al .",
    "2003 ; brook et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "previous numerical simulations showed that accretion of a small satellite galaxy on the pre - existing thin stellar disk of a disk galaxy can dynamically heat up the disk to form the thick disk ( e.g. , quinn et al .",
    "1993 ; walker et al . 1996",
    "; huang & carlberg 1997 ; velazquez & white 1999 villalobos & helmi 2008 ) : this formation process is referred to as the `` minor merger '' scenario .",
    "using cosmological simulations with self - consistent chemical evolution models , brook et al .",
    "( 2004 ) demonstrated that thick disks of galaxies can be formed by accretion / merging of gas - rich dwarfs at high redshifts ( this is referred to as the `` gas - rich merger '' scenario ) .",
    "radial migration of stars due to internal stellar dynamics of disk galaxies ( sellwood & binney 2002 ) has been demonstrated to be important for the formation of the galactic thick disk ( e.g. , schnrich & binney 2009 ; loebman et al .",
    "noguchi ( 1998 ) first showed that massive clumps developed in the early dynamical evolution of galactic disks can heat up the original disks to form thick disks .",
    "the predicted properties of the galactic thick disk from these formation scenarios have recently been compared with the present - day properties of the thick disk : the orbital eccentricity distribution ( e.g. , sales et al .",
    "2009 ; dierickx et al .",
    "2010 ; dinescu et al .",

    "these comparisons between theoretical and observational results have pointed out strength and weakness of the above mentioned scenarios in explaining chemical and dynamical properties of the galactic thick disk .",
    "for example , the observed orbital eccentricity distribution of the thick disk stars is consistent either with the gas - rich merger scenario or the minor merger scenario ( e.g. , dierickx et al .",
    "2010 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2011 dinescu et al . 2011 ; wilson et al . 2011 ) .",
    "these comparisons however are not yet extensive enough to decide which of the proposed scenarios is the most self - consistent and convincing .",
    "although previous numerical studies based on the minor merger scenario provided some key predictions on structural and kinematical properties of the galactic thick disk ( quinn et al . 1993 ; walker et al . 1996 ; huang & carlberg 1997 ; villalobos & helmi 2008 ) , they did not discuss chemical properties nor their correlation with the dynamical properties observed in the galactic thick disk .",
    "given that the thick disk is composed largely of rather old stars with ages larger than @xmath0 gyr ( e.g. , allende prieto et al .",
    "2006 ; bensby et al .",
    "2007 ) , the formation epoch of the thick disk should be well before the formation of the thin disk , and thus dynamical properties of the thick disk should have been strongly influenced by the growing thin disk for the last @xmath0 gyr .",
    "therefore , previous simulations which did not consider the formation of the thin disk subsequent to the formation of the thick disk are not ideally suited to a comparison with the observed ones .",
    "although the galactic bar ( or the `` barred bulge '' ) could have significantly influenced the dynamical evolution of the thick disk , such dynamical influences have not been investigated in previous simulations .",
    "furthermore , chemical properties of the thick disk formed by ancient minor merger events are yet to be discussed in the literature .",
    "the purpose of this paper is thus to investigate chemical and dynamical properties of the galactic thick disk formed from ancient minor merger events based on new chemical and dynamical models for the formation of the thick disk . in the present minor merger scenario ,",
    "the thick disk was formed from an accretion of a dwarf galaxy on the fgtd about @xmath0 gyr ago and therefore has long been dynamically influenced by the growing thin disk since its formation .",
    "although previous numerical simulations investigated the dynamical evolution of the large magellanic cloud composed of thin and thick disks ( bekki 2009 ) and dynamical influences of a growing thin disk on a pre - existing thick disk in a disk galaxy ( e.g. , kazantzidis et al .",
    "2009 ; villalobos et al .",
    "2010 ) , they did not discuss how non - axisymmetric structures such as bars and spirals in a _ live _ thin disk influence the dynamical evolution of a thick disk in a galaxy .",
    "the present study therefore adopts a new two - component disk model in which a _ live _ thin disk can dynamically influence a thick disk through the growth of non - axisymmetric structures over a long timescale .",
    "we then use the model to discuss structural and kinematical properties of the present galactic thick disk surrounding the thin disk .",
    "we also construct a new self - consistent chemical evolution model in which the early star formation history and chemical evolution of the thin disk is influenced by ( i ) the remaining gas of the thick disk , ( ii ) later gas accretion onto the thin disk , and ( iii ) dynamical properties of the thick disk .",
    "since the present chemical evolution model is the first one that is based on the minor merger scenario , the predicted properties of the model enable us to discuss strength and weakness of the minor merger scenario in explaining the observed properties of the thick disk ( e.g. , chen et al .",

    ", we particularly discuss the radial metallicity gradient of the thick disk , dynamical interaction between the thin and thick disks after the formation of the thick disk , the metallicity distribution function , and the [ @xmath7/fe]-[fe / h ] relation of the thick disk .",
    "the present model is novel , because these thick disk properties have not been discussed in previous theoretical studies based on the minor merger scenario .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our new two - component dynamical models of the galactic disk and our chemical evolution models for the galactic thin and thick disks . in  3 , we present the results of the present chemical and dynamical models for the galactic disks . in  4",
    ", we discuss a number of key observational results in the context of different formation scenarios for the thick disk and we summarize our conclusions in  5 .",
    "although our previous chemodynamical models of the formation of the galaxy discussed physical correlations between [ fe / h ] and kinematic of the galactic disk and stellar halo ( bekki & chiba 2000 , 2001 ) , the present study , which is not based on a fully self - consistent chemodynamical model , does not allow us to do so .",
    "because of this limitation , we only briefly discuss the observed correlations between chemical and kinematical properties of the thick disk in the present paper , and will extensively discuss these in our future studies based on fully self - consistent chemodynamical simulations . because we focus exclusively on the galactic thick disk in the present paper , we will discuss the origin of thick disks observed in other disk galaxies ( e.g. , yoachim & dalcanton 2008 ) in the context of the minor merger scenario in forthcoming papers .",

    "these models are used for deriving radial metallicity gradients of the thick disk formed by minor merging , and determining structural and kinematical properties of the present thick disk .",
    "we then describe one - zone chemical evolution models that are used for deriving the mdfs and correlations between different chemical abundances of the thin and thick disks (  2.2 ) .",
    "dynamical properties of the stellar remnants of minor mergers and orbital eccentricity distributions of thick disk stars formed from minor merging have been extensively discussed in a number of recent papers ( e.g. , villalobos & helmi 2008 ; di matteo et al . 2010 ; qu et al . 2011 ) and we confirm that their main results can be held for the present minor merger models .",

    "we adopted @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 for the dark matter halo , and the mass ratio of halo to disk ( @xmath19 ) is regarded as a free parameter that can control the mass - ratio of the simulated thick disk to the thin disk . in the present scenario ,",
    "minor merging occurred when the fgtd was still rapidly growing and thus a much less massive disk embedded in a massive dark matter halo .",
    "we therefore consider that @xmath19 should be rather large and investigate models with @xmath19 ranging from 79 to 157 .",
    "we mainly describe the results of the models with @xmath20 in which the final stellar disk has a thick disk component with the mass @xmath21% of its thin disk component and a maximum circular velocity ( @xmath22 ) @xmath23 km s@xmath24 , which is reasonable for the galaxy ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 2007 ) .",

    "it is clear from this figure that the original thin disk has @xmath22 that is significantly smaller than the present one in the galaxy .",
    "recent photometric and spectroscopic observations of the galactic stellar and gaseous components have demonstrated that the present thin disk has metallicities that depend on location within the disk , i.e. , metallicity gradients ( e.g. , friel 1995 ) . in the present minor merger scenario ,",
    "stars within the present galactic bulge had been already formed before the minor merger occurred and they initially consisted of the inner part of the fgtd .",
    "the inner part of the thick disk became the part of the galactic bulge in response to the bar formation in the inner part of the two - component galactic disk .",

    "it would be possible for different stars at the same @xmath35 in the fgtd to have different metallicities owing to chemical and dynamical evolution , but we do not consider this possibility .",
    "ignoring such a dispersion in the initial metallicity at each radius allow us to avoid introducing additional free parameters for clarity .",
    "the final mean metallicity in the central region ( @xmath52 kpc ) corresponding to the galactic bulge region in each merger remnant can be as low as @xmath53 , owing to radial mixing of stellar populations in the present study .",
    "the central metallicity can be higher if we adopt higher metallicities in the inner regions of the fgtd .",

    "a thin stellar disk is placed within the thick disk so that the dynamical response of the thick disk to the slowly growing thin disk can be investigated .",
    "the thick disk formed in a minor merger model is inclined significantly with respect to the @xmath28-@xmath29 plane with the inclination angle depending on @xmath88 .",

    "this addition of stellar particles can mimic the slow growth of the thin disk by gas accretion from the galactic halo region and the subsequent star formation from the gas .",

    "stellar particles with the total particle number @xmath97 are randomly allocated their initial locations at each time step during the growth of the thin disk .",
    "we assume that the disk growth rate is constant , @xmath97 at each time step is @xmath98 in the present study , where @xmath99 is the total number of stellar particles used in the thin disk and @xmath100 is the total number of time steps in a numerical simulation for the growth of the thin disk . after the completion of the thin disk formation , we then allocate the three dimensional ( 3d ) velocities to each thin disk stellar particle according to the final mass profiles of the dark matter , thick disk , and thin disk in the same way that we did for the fgtd .",
    "in addition to the rotational velocity made by the gravitational field of halo and disk components , the initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersion are given to the disk component according to the epicyclic theory with toomre s parameter @xmath27 = 1.5 . the total number of stellar particles in the thin disk is set to be 100000 for all models in the present study .",

    "accordingly , the present chemical evolution models are different from those previously adopted ( e.g. , chiappini et al .",

    "the first scenario is the `` continuous star formation model '' in which the thin disk stars start to form from the thick disk s remaining gas ( corresponding to only @xmath21% of the original gas ) mixed with the gas accreted onto the disk _ immediately after the thick disk formation_. in this model , chemical abundances of the first stars in the thin disk are similar to those of the most metal - rich stars in the thick disk .",
    "the second scenario is the `` temporal truncation model '' in which star formation in the thin disk can not start until some amount of gas is accreted onto the disk .",
    "therefore , the first stars in the thin disk will have chemical abundances different from those of the final stars in the thick disk . here",
    "the timing to initiate the formation of thin disk stars is set at the time when the metallicity of gas is diluted to [ fe / h]=@xmath40 by gas accretion from the halo region ( corresponding to about 1.5 gyr after the formation of the thick disk ) . the total amount of the halo gas accreted onto the disk before the commencement of star formation in the thin disk is about five times larger than that of the remaining gas of the thick disk .",
    "we discuss a possible mechanism for the assumed temporal truncation of star formation later in appendix a. the third scenario is the `` gas expulsion model '' in which the thick disk s remaining gas is expelled immediately after the formation of the thick disk and thus the thin disk is formed purely from gas accreted from the halo .",
    "since our n - body simulations , which do not include star formation and gas accretion , do not allow us to determine the most probable model among the above - mentioned three , we investigate all three scenarios and compare them with one another in  3.3 .",

    "it should be stressed that the radial transfer of the inner metal - rich stars into the solar neighborhood depends strongly on @xmath58 and that the radial transfer can be less effective in minor merging with smaller @xmath58 . as a result of radial mixing of stellar populations with different metallicities",

    "figure 8 shows that the shapes of the mdfs for the three different regions of the thick disk depend on the adopted initial metallicity gradient of the fgtd , which suggests that the mdfs can have some fossil information on the original metallicity gradient of the fgtd before ancient minor merging transformed it into the thick disk .",

    "as shown in figure 9 , a slightly shorter stellar bar is formed in the thick disk at @xmath150 gyr .",
    "this formation of the `` barred thick disk '' suggests that the galactic thick disk is likely to have a barred structure , in particular , in its inner part .",
    "figure 10 also shows that the thick disk appears to be thicker and more triaxial after its dynamical interaction with the thin disk .",

    "this figure accordingly shows how the radial and vertical structures of the two disks change as a result of the dynamical interaction between the stellar bar and the two disks .",
    "the simulated rather flat profile of the vertical structure of the thick disk at @xmath155kpc in the present study can be seen also in a recent work by villalobos et al .",
    "although the inner part of the thick disk is morphologically transformed into a bar , the radial density profile does not change so significantly . the central ( @xmath52 kpc ) and outer ( @xmath156 kpc ) parts of the thin disk show slight increases in the radial surface stellar density profile ( @xmath157 ) whereas the inner part at @xmath158 kpc shows a decrease in @xmath159 .",
    "the thick disk at @xmath160kpc does not show a significant change in the overall vertical structure , though the profile becomes slightly steeper .",
    "the vertical density profile of the thin disk becomes appreciably flatter ( or the thin disk becomes slightly thicker ) owing to the dynamical action of the bar .",
    "thus , the radial and vertical density profiles of the thin disk can be more strongly influenced by the stellar bar in comparison with those of the thick disk .",
    "figure 12 shows that the thin and thick disks have different kinematical properties just after the formation of the inner stellar bar at @xmath150 gyr .",
    "owing to the dynamical influence of the stellar bar on the thick disk , the @xmath2 difference in the thin and thick disk at @xmath39 becomes smaller ( @xmath161 km s@xmath24 ) .",

    "the two - component disks constructed from merger remnants with @xmath81 ( m2 ) and 0.1 ( m3 ) have smaller @xmath2 differences in the thin and thick disks and smaller @xmath109 . in these models with smaller @xmath58 , the differences in the radial profiles of @xmath2 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 between the thin and the thick disks at @xmath139 kpc are small and thus are less consistent with observations , which means that minor merging with lower @xmath58 is unlikely to be responsible for the formation of the galactic thick disk .",
    "the model m4 with larger @xmath58 ( = 0.3 ) shows a higher degree of kinematical differences in the thin and thick disks , which can be still consistent with observations .",
    "the stellar bar developed in the thick disk for this model is a shorter ( or fatter ) and weaker one .",
    "the thick disk in the model m5 with @xmath110 , @xmath114 , and @xmath168 ( thus more energetic minor merger ) does not clearly show a strongly barred structure , though the thin disk has a strong bar .",
    "as shown in figure 13 , the fgtd is too strongly damaged by minor merging so that the @xmath2 difference in the thin and thick disk is quite large , even after the slow growth of the thin disk .",
    "this model can not be regarded as reasonable for the galactic disk .",
    "although we confirm that stellar bars can be formed in thick disks for most models ( i.e. , m1-m12 except m5 ) , the morphological properties of the simulated bars are different between different models .",
    "for example , the model m12 with a smaller mass of the thin disk ( @xmath169 ) shows the formation of a shorter and weaker bar in the thin disk so that the thick disk can not clearly show a strongly barred structure ( but show a fat , elliptic morphology ) owing to the weaker dynamical effect of the bar of the thin disk on the thick disk .",
    "the models with smaller @xmath89 ( e.g. , @xmath170 ) do not show the formation of bars in the thin ( thus thick ) disk .",
    "these results suggest that the thick disk can be influenced by the barred structure of the thin disk only in the later stage of the disk evolution ( i.e. , when the disk has a larger mass ) .",
    "these models with smaller @xmath89 show lower velocity dispersion within the thick disk ( e.g. , @xmath171 km s@xmath24 ) , which is more consistent with observations .",
    "the present results on the kinematical differences between thin and thick disks do not depend so strongly on @xmath8 , @xmath19 , and @xmath172 , but they depend more strongly on @xmath58 and @xmath68",
    ". the dynamical properties of the model m6 with large @xmath68 ( = 60 ) are less consistent with observations than than other models with lower @xmath88 ( @xmath173 ) , as already demonstrated by previous works ( e.g. , villalobos et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "it is possible that the slow growth of the thin disk and its stellar bar can also significantly change the radial metallicity gradient owing to the dynamical action of the bar .",
    "figure 14 shows that the radial metallicity gradient at @xmath150 gyr becomes slightly flattened in comparison with the gradient just after minor merging shown in figure 5 .",
    "the reason for this is that the metallicities in the inner regions of the thick disk at @xmath139 kpc become systematically smaller after the formation of the stellar bar .",
    "this result implies that the growth process of the thin disk and the dynamical action of the stellar bar can be important factors for determining the slope of the radial metallicity gradient of the thick disk .",
    "it should be stressed here that the flattening of the radial metallicity gradient of the thick disk by the thin disk can be also clearly seen in the model with lower @xmath58 ( = 0.05 and 0.1 ) : the radial metallicity gradients of the thick disks at @xmath138 kpc in these two - component models become significantly more flattened than those just after minor merging .    the dynamical interaction between stellar bars and thick disks in the present two - component disk models can transfer stars within @xmath174 kpc to the outer disk regions at @xmath175 .",
    "however the number fractions of stars that are located initially at @xmath143 kpc and finally at @xmath176 kpc is less than @xmath177 for the present models , even if the central bars become long and strong .",
    "therefore , the radial transfer of bulge stars with high [ fe / h ] to the solar - neighborhood is much less efficient in the present models .",
    "it should be stressed here that some fraction of metal - rich stars in the inner disk regions can be transferred to the solar neighborhood . on the other hand , the slow growth of the thin disk can contract the thick disk so that the number fractions of more metal - rich stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath178 ) at @xmath138 kpc in the thick disks can slightly decrease as the thin disk slowly grows ( though the number fractions just after minor merging are larger ) .",
    "thus these results in  3.1 and 3.2 suggest that both minor merging and dynamical influences of the evolving thin disk on the thick disk can be important in understanding the origin of the radial metallicity gradient and the presence of metal - rich stars at @xmath39 in the galactic thick disk .      figure 15 shows the star formation histories , mdfs , and [ mg / fe]-[fe / h ] relations for the thin and thick disks in the continuous star formation model .",
    "the upper panel of figure 15 shows the predicted star formation history of the galactic disk , where the thick disk is first formed rapidly , followed by a gradual formation of the thin disk over a prolonged timescale . here , each sfr is normalized so that each total stellar mass is unity .",
    "the resultant mdfs for thick disk and thin disk , and the correlations of [ mg / fe ] with [ fe / h ] are shown in this figure . in this model ,",
    "the thick disk formation terminates when the metallicity reaches [ fe / h]@xmath1790 at around 1.5 gyr , and accordingly this model explains the overall shape of the observed mdf .",
    "however , if we assume a longer timescale of star formation , the predicted [ mg / fe ] trend afterwards continues to decrease with increasing [ fe / h ] whereas the observed [ mg / fe ] for [ fe / h]@xmath1800 holds broadly constant .",
    "therefore , the model can not reproduce well the observed flat distribution of the thick disk stars with [ fe / h]@xmath181 in the [ mg / fe]-[fe / h ] relation ( e.g. , bensby et al .",
    "although the total number of such stars could be less than @xmath21% ( e.g. , bensby et al .",
    "2007 ) , this apparent inconsistency implies that such metal - rich stars can not form _ in situ _ at the solar - neighborhood .",
    "thus , we need to consider that ( i ) this apparent inconsistency is due largely to the limitation of the adopted one - zone chemical evolution model which does not consider mixing of stellar populations between different disk regions and thus ( ii ) these metal - rich stars with [ fe / h]@xmath181 and [ mg / fe]@xmath182 are likely to migrate from the inner thick disk and the bulge where more metal - rich stars exist",
    ". we will discuss this point later in the context of radial mixing due to minor merging in  4.2 .",
    "since the thick disk formation leaves the metal - rich gas as an end product of its chemical evolution , the evolution of [ mg / fe ] starts from [ fe / h]@xmath1790 ( when the final gas mass fraction is @xmath21% ) .",
    "then , [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] decreases and increases , respectively , owing to dilution by metal - poor infalling gas with a high [ mg / fe ] ratio ( @xmath179 + 0.4 ) .",
    "this reverse evolution comes to an end when the chemical enrichment by star formation exceeds the effect of gas dilution , and subsequently an usual evolutionary path appears . in the end , the overall behavior explains , in part , a large dispersion in stellar ages as well as in [ mg / fe ] among the thin disk stars .",
    "in addition , it may be possible to claim that the remaining metal - rich gas after the thick disk formation results in the presence of no metal - poor thin disk stars .",
    "the results of the temporal truncation model do not differ significantly from those of the continuous star formation model in terms of the mdf of the thin disk stars .",
    "figure 16 shows that the temporal truncation model can reproduce the observed mdf of the thin disk stars as well as the continuous one .",
    "the remarkable difference between the two is that there are no old thin disk stars with [ fe / h]@xmath183 and [ mg / fe]@xmath184 in the temporal truncation model , because star formation in the thin disk can start only after the gas of the disk has [ fe / h]@xmath127 owing to gas accretion in the temporal truncation model .",
    "there is a clear distinction between the locations of the thin and thick disk stars on the [ mg / fe]-[fe / h ] relation in the temporal truncation model versus the continuous star formation model .",
    "however , it is currently difficult to determine which of the two can better fit to observations owing to the lack of observational information on the relation between [ mg / fe ] , [ fe / h ] , and stellar ages among the thin disk stars .",
    "the gas expulsion model shows mdfs and [ mg / fe]-[fe / h ] relations quite similar to those in the other two models , which implies that it would be difficult to observationally determine the best possible model among the three based only on the comparison between the observed and simulated mdfs and [ mg / fe ] relations . the only significant difference between this model and",
    "other two is the presence of thin disk stars with low [ fe / h ] ( @xmath185 ) and high [ mg / fe ] ( @xmath186 ) . in the end , the locations of the oldest thin disk stars on the [ mg / fe]-[fe / h ] relation can be significantly different among the three models , which implies that the simultaneous derivation of ages and abundances for such older stars is a key to distinguish between the three models .",
    "the overall agreement of the observed and simulated mdfs and [ mg / fe]-[fe / h ] relations of the galactic thin and thick disk stars for all of the three models suggests that the minor merger scenario of the thick disk formation is a promising one .",
    "the present study has first demonstrated that the galactic thick disk can have a barred structure if it was formed prior to the formation of the galactic thin disk and thus has long been influenced dynamically by the thin disk with a stellar bar .",
    "given that most models have shown the formation of the barred thick disk in the two - component stellar disks , the present prediction on the presence of the barred thick disk in the galaxy might well be regarded as robust .",
    "recent theoretical studies on the formation of the thick disk through radial mixing of stars did not show the formation of the barred thick disk in their models ( e.g. , schnrich & binney 2009 ; loebman et al .",
    "previous cosmological simulations on the thick disk formation via accretion ( abadi et al .",

    "wang & silk ( 1994 ) proposed that one of important parameters for galactic star formation in the two - component disk composed of gas and stars is the effective @xmath27 parameter ( @xmath255 ) , which is defined as @xmath256 , where @xmath257 and @xmath258 are the stellar and gaseous @xmath27 parameters , respectively .",
    "given that the radial velocity dispersion of the thick disk can be a factor of @xmath149 higher than that of the initial the fgtd depending on @xmath58 ( thus @xmath259 becomes larger than @xmath225 ) , the two - component galactic disk just after the thick disk formation might well have a higher @xmath255 .",
    "if we adopt @xmath260 and if we assume that star formation in the thin disk can happen for @xmath261 , then @xmath262 needs to be less than 1.5 .",
    "therefore , it is possible that star formation in the thin disk can not efficiently occur until @xmath262 becomes as low as 1.5 owing to the increase of the surface gas density ( and/or the decrease of the gaseous velocity dispersion ) .",
    "the possible higher @xmath255 in the early stage of the thin disk formation therefore would be responsible for severe suppression of star formation in the thick disk for the minor merger scenario .",
    "if all of the remaining gas were expelled from the thick disk after the minor merger owing to energetic stellar winds associated with a triggered starburst , then new stars in the thin disk can be formed purely from gas accreted onto the disk from the galactic halo .",
    "if this is the case , then there is no chemical connection between the thin and thick disks , and the above severe suppression of star formation in the thin disk does not need to be considered in the minor merger scenario .",

    "<S> the dynamical properties of the thick disk have long been influenced both by the mass growth of the second generation of the galactic thin disk ( i.e. , the present thin disk ) and by its non - axisymmetric structures . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the early star formation history and chemical evolution of the thin disk was influenced by the remaining gas of the thick disk . </S>",
    "<S> based on n - body simulations and chemical evolution models , we investigate the radial metallicity gradient , structural and kinematical properties , and detailed chemical abundance patterns of the thick disk . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations show that the ancient minor merger event can significantly flatten the original radial metallicity gradient of the fgtd , in particular , in the outer part , and also can be responsible for migration of inner metal - rich stars into the outer part ( @xmath1kpc ) . </S>",

    "<S> the simulated orbital eccentricity distributions in the thick disk for models with higher mass - ratios ( @xmath3 ) and lower orbital eccentricities ( @xmath4 ) of minor mergers are in good agreement with the corresponding observations . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated @xmath2-@xmath5 relation of the thick disk in models with low orbital inclination angles of mergers are also in good agreement with the latest observational results . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical metallicity gradient of the simulated thick disk is rather flat or very weakly negative at the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> our galactic chemical evolution models show that if we choose two distinctive timescales for star formation in the thin and thick disks , then the models can explain both the observed metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) and correlations between [ mg / fe ] and [ fe / h ] for the two disks in a self - consistent manner . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the early star formation history and chemical evolution of the galactic thin disk can be influenced by the pre - existing thick disk . </S>"
