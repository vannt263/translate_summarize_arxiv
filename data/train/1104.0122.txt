    "alice has baked a square cake with raisins for bob , but really she would like to keep most of it for herself . in this",
    ", she relies on a peculiar habit of bob : he eats only rectangular pieces of the cake , with sides parallel to the sides of the cake , that contain exactly one raisin each , and that raisin has to be exactly in the lower left corner ( see fig .",
    "[ f : example ] ) .",
    "alice gets whatever remains after bob has cut out all such pieces . in order to give bob at least some chance",
    ", alice has to put a raisin in the lower left corner of the whole cake .",
    "mathematically , the cake is the square @xmath2 ^ 2 $ ] , the raisins form an @xmath1-point set @xmath6 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath7 is required , and bob s share consists of @xmath1 axis - parallel rectangles with disjoint interiors , each of them having a point of @xmath0 as the lower left corner .    by placing points densely along the main diagonal ,",
    "alice can limit bob s share to  @xmath8 , with @xmath9 arbitrarily small . a natural question",
    "then is , can bob always obtain at least half of the cake ?",
    "this question ( in a cake - free formulation ) appears in winkler  @xcite ( `` packing rectangles '' , p.  133 ) , where he claims it to be at least 10 years old and of origin unknown to him .",
    "the first written reference seems to be an ibm puzzle webpage  @xcite .",
    "we tried to answer the question and could not , probably similar to many other people before us .",
    "we believe that there are no simple examples leaving more than @xmath10 to alice , but on the other hand , it seems difficult to prove even that bob can always secure @xmath11 of the cake . we were thus led to seriously considering the possibility that alice might be able to limit bob s share to less than @xmath4 , for every @xmath12 , but that the number of points @xmath1 she would need would grow enormously as a function of  @xmath13 .    here",
    "we prove a doubly exponential lower bound on this function .",
    "first we introduce the following notation . for a finite @xmath14",
    "^ 2 $ ] , let @xmath15 be the largest area bob can win for @xmath0 , and let @xmath16 be the infimum of @xmath15 over all @xmath1-point @xmath0 as above .",
    ", there are finitely many possible placement of bob s _ inclusion - maximal _ rectangles , and therefore , @xmath15 is attained by some choice of rectangles . on the other hand , it is not so clear whether @xmath16 is attained ; we leave this question aside . ] also , for a real number @xmath17 let @xmath18 .",
    "[ t : ] there exists a constant @xmath19 such that for all @xmath20 , @xmath21 .    the only previous results on this problem we could find is the master s thesis of mller - itten @xcite .",
    "she conjectured that alice s optimal strategy is placing the @xmath1 points on the main diagonal with equal spacing ( for which bob s share is @xmath22 ) .",
    "she proved this conjecture for @xmath23 , and also in the `` grid '' case with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a permutation of @xmath26 .",
    "she also showed that @xmath27 .",
    "the problem considered here can be put into a wider context .",
    "various problems of fair division of resources , often phrased as cake - cutting problems , go back at least to steinhaus , banach and knaster ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "even closer to our particular setting is winkler s _ pizza problem _ , recently solved by cibulka et al .",
    "we call a point  @xmath28 a _ minimum _ of a set @xmath29 ^ 2 $ ] if there is no @xmath30 for which both @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be an enumeration of the minima of @xmath34 in the order of decreasing @xmath35-coordinate ( and increasing @xmath36-coordinate ) .",
    "let @xmath37 be the union of all the axis - parallel rectangles with lower left corners at @xmath38 whose interior avoids @xmath0 ; see fig .",
    "[ f : sta](a ) .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath39 be the area of @xmath37 , and let @xmath40 be the largest area of an axis - parallel rectangle contained in @xmath37 .",
    "let us also define @xmath41 .",
    "for a point @xmath42 and an axis - parallel rectangle @xmath43 ^ 2 $ ] with lower left corner at @xmath44 , we denote by  @xmath28 be the maximum area of the cake bob can gain in  @xmath45 using only rectangles with lower left corner in points of @xmath46 .",
    "by re - scaling , we have @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the area of  @xmath45 and @xmath49 denotes the set @xmath50 transformed by the affine transform that maps @xmath45 onto @xmath2 ^ 2 $ ]",
    ".    we will use the monotonicity of @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , alice can always place an extra point on the right side of the square , say , which does not influence bob s share .",
    "we decompose the complement of @xmath37 into horizontal rectangles @xmath54 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ f : sta](a ) , so that @xmath55 is the lower left corner of @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be the area of @xmath56 ; we have @xmath58 .    by the above and by an obvious superadditivity , we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( this is a somewhat simple - minded estimate , since it does nt take into account any interaction among the @xmath56 ) .",
    "the following lemma captures the main properties of this decomposition .",
    "[ l : nobig ] let us assume that @xmath61 , where @xmath19 is a suitable ( sufficiently large ) constant",
    ". then    * @xmath62 ( the staircase has a small area ) , and * @xmath63 for every @xmath64 ( none of the subproblems occupies almost all of the area ) .",
    "first we note that since no rectangle with lower left corner @xmath38 and upper right corner in @xmath37 has area bigger than @xmath40 , the region @xmath37 lies below the hyperbola @xmath65 .",
    "thus @xmath66 .",
    "this yields @xmath67 , and so @xmath68 ( for @xmath69 sufficiently large ) .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath70 ; since @xmath71 , it suffices to show @xmath72 for all  @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 be the @xmath35-coordinate of @xmath55 for @xmath75 , and let @xmath76 ; we have @xmath77 for @xmath78 .    first , if @xmath79 , then @xmath80 by the above , and we are done .",
    "so we assume @xmath81 .",
    "the area of @xmath37 can be bounded from above as indicated in fig .",
    "[ f : sta](b ) .",
    "namely , the rectangle @xmath82 has area at most @xmath40 ( since it is contained in @xmath37 ) , and the rectangle @xmath83 above it also has area no more than @xmath40 ( using @xmath81 ) .",
    "the top right corner of @xmath84 lies on the hyperbola @xmath85 used above , and thus @xmath84 has area at most @xmath40 as well .",
    "finally , the region @xmath86 on the right of @xmath84 and below the hyperbola has area @xmath87 .    since @xmath88",
    ", we have @xmath89 . using @xmath90",
    "we obtain @xmath91 ( again using the assumption that @xmath69 is large ) .",
    "finally , we have @xmath92 , and the lemma is proved .",
    "let @xmath20 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath13 is of the form @xmath93 , where @xmath94 .",
    "in particular , @xmath95 for all @xmath96 .      we thus start with the derivation of ( [ e : recur ] ) .",
    "let us look at the inequality ( [ e : decompose ] ) for an @xmath1-point set @xmath0 that attains @xmath16 .",
    "is attained , we should choose @xmath1-point @xmath0 with @xmath100 for all @xmath101 .",
    "] since @xmath102 for all @xmath73 , we have @xmath103 for all @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath39 be as above .",
    "first we derive @xmath104 .",
    "indeed , if we had @xmath105 , then the right - hand of ( [ e : decompose ] ) can be estimated as follows : @xmath106 which contradicts the inequality  ( [ e : decompose ] ) .",
