    "let us now outline the proof of the main theorem , and in particular explain where the second section is needed . by a _ relative symplectic fibration _ on @xmath0 we will mean a quintuple @xmath25 as in theorem  [ thm : main ] , only with the standard form @xmath26 replaced by any symplectic form @xmath27 cohomologous to @xmath26",
    ". we will prove ( corollary  [ cor : fib ] ) that for every symplectic fibration @xmath28 with @xmath29 there exists a homotopy of relative symplectic fibrations @xmath30 with fixed symplectic form @xmath26 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the standard foliation with leaves @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the standard sections at the south and north pole .",

    "parallel transport along closed paths @xmath40\\to\\sigma$ ] gives holonomy maps which are symplectomorphisms of the fibre @xmath41 and measure the non - integrability of the horizontal distribution .",
    "it is not hard to show that a symplectic fibration @xmath28 with trivial holonomy around all loops is diffeomorphic to @xmath42 , and a theorem of gromov implies that they are actually homotopic with fixed symplectic form if they both have symplectic form @xmath26 .",
    "thus , most of the work will go into deforming a given relative symplectic fibration @xmath28 to one with trivial holonomy . after pulling back @xmath28 by a diffeomorphism",

    ", we kill the holonomy along all circles of latitude @xmath44 . for this , let @xmath45 be spherical coordinates on @xmath8 , where @xmath46 denotes the latitude and @xmath47 denotes the longitude . after the first step , the holonomy maps @xmath48 along @xmath44 give a loop in @xmath49 , the group of symplectomorphisms of the annulus ( the sphere minus two polar caps ) which equal the identity near the boundary . since the fundamental group of @xmath49 vanishes , we can contract the loop of inverses @xmath50 and obtain a family of hamiltonians @xmath51 which generates the contraction .",
    "the closed @xmath2-form @xmath52 then defines a symplectic connection with trivial holonomy around all @xmath44 .",
    "however , @xmath53 need not be symplectic if @xmath54 is large .",
    "this can be remedied by the inflation procedure due to lalonde and mcduff  @xcite . in this procedure , the symplectic form @xmath27 is deformed along a fibre and a section ( and @xmath55 suitably rescaled ) in order to make @xmath56 symplectic .",
    "however , this process will in general destroy monotonicity of @xmath9 . in order to keep the lagrangian torus monotone , we perform the inflation procedure along a fibre and the _ two _ sections @xmath57 in a symmetric way .",
    "it is at this point of the proof that we need the existence of a second symplectic section .",
    "once the holonomy along circles of latitude is trivial , in the third and final step ( at the end of section  [ sec : killholonomy ] ) we deform the symplectic form to the standard form .",
    "this finishes the outline of the proof .",
    "the idea to apply the results of ivrii s thesis to the hamiltonian classification of monotone tori in @xmath0 originated in 2003 in the first author s discussions with y.  eliashberg .",
    "however , at the time we did not realize the necessity of a second symplectic section and were puzzled by the apparent contradiction between this result and the existence of an exotic monotone torus in @xmath0 .",
