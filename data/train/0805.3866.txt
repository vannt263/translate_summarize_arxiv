    "<S> the belle experiment collected in 2005 - 6 a total of 23.6  fb@xmath0 of data at the @xmath1 resonance , also known as @xmath2(5s ) . these constitute nearly all of the world s sample of @xmath3(10860 ) events , which provide clean @xmath4 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> we present here several @xmath4 and @xmath2(10860 ) properties recently extracted from these data .    </S>",
    "<S> belle,@xcite one of two @xmath5-factory experiments , is located at kekb@xcite and studies primarily the @xmath6 asymmetries of @xmath5 meson decay in @xmath7 annihilations at the @xmath2(4s ) resonance ( @xmath8  mev , @xmath9  mev).@xcite however , the richness of belle physics reaches well beyond @xmath6 ( see , e.g. , http://belle.kek.jp/ ) ; an unequalled sample of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and two - photon events enables access to many other topics . </S>",
    "<S> we now add @xmath4 and bottomonium studies , thanks to data collected at the @xmath2(10860 ) resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2(10860 ) , ( @xmath13  mev/@xmath14 , @xmath15  mev),@xcite is interpreted as @xmath2(5s ) , the fourth excitation of the vector bound state of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> it is above @xmath17 threshold and , given the success of the @xmath2(4s ) program in characterizing properties of @xmath18 , it is natural to contemplate @xmath4 at @xmath2(10860 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 environment produces clean events , efficiently triggered , with precisely known center - of - mass energy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the @xmath5-factory offers an existing facility with high luminosity , a well - studied detector , and @xmath2(4s ) data for comparisons . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> high integrated luminosities are needed , @xmath19(10860))@xmath20(4s)@xmath21  nb , and events include @xmath18 as well as @xmath4 . while @xmath4 is produced copiously in hadronic collisions , the @xmath2(10860 ) can be competitive , particularly in aspects of @xmath4 decay that are limited by systematic effects at a hadron machine .    </S>",
    "<S> belle has run twice at the @xmath2(10860 ) . in june 2005 </S>",
    "<S> a three - day `` engineering '' run served to test kekb , which had never operated at energies above the @xmath2(4s ) , and study the basics of @xmath2(10860 ) , @xmath4 , and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> a scan of five energy points was used to locate the peak , at @xmath2310869  mev , where 1.86  fb@xmath0 were collected . by june 2006 </S>",
    "<S> , results confirmed the projected potential of @xmath2(10860 ) , and 21.7  fb@xmath0 were collected in 20 days .    </S>",
    "<S> as prerequisite to studies of @xmath4 , its abundance in @xmath2(10860 ) events was determined from the 2005 data.@xcite about 10% of the hadronic events are resonance ( assumed to be @xmath16 ) , the rest being continuum @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ 5s_profile ] ( l ) displays @xmath26 , the ratio of the 2@xmath27 and 0@xmath28 fox - wolfram moments,@xcite a measure of `` jettiness '' that tends to be lower for the more isotropic resonance events . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath29  @xmath16  events / fb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath16 events may fragment to : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is a @xmath35- or @xmath36-quark ) . to determine the fraction ( @xmath37 ) that are @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the inclusive rate @xmath38 , an average over @xmath4 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ( figure  [ 5s_profile](r ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> measured @xmath41 and our understanding of decay mechanisms are used to estimate @xmath42.@xcite assuming that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are produced equally , @xmath43 depends only on @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the same analysis , performed with inclusive @xmath44 yields , gives an independent value of @xmath37 with larger uncertainties ; @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the combined result is @xmath46.@xcite    = 4.3 cm  = 4.5 cm    the results below , based on 23.6  fb@xmath0 , cover @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( preliminary ) , @xmath49(ns)@xmath50,@xcite and @xmath51 , @xmath52.@xcite @xmath4 decays are identified by `` full reconstruction '' of all final state particles , a method used with great success at the @xmath2(4s ) . </S>",
    "<S> each candidate s energy and momentum in the @xmath7 center - of - mass are evaluated as @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in @xmath17 ( </S>",
    "<S> analogous to @xmath2(4s)@xmath55 ) , the @xmath4 carries the beam energy , so @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for @xmath58 or @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> , the kinematics of @xmath60 ( with 50  mev energy ) leads to localized signals as well . in the case of @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> the result is effectively the loss of @xmath61  mev from the @xmath4 pair , with the energy being shared approximately equally : @xmath62mev and @xmath63  mev . for @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> the energy reduction is @xmath6450  mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the decay @xmath65 proceeds dominantly via a ckm - favored spectator process . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 is reconstructed in @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . shown in figure  [ dspi](l ) </S>",
    "<S> is the distribution in @xmath70 and @xmath71 for data , with signal boxes for @xmath59 , @xmath58(inclusion of @xmath72 is implied ) , and @xmath17 events . a two - dimensional fit yields @xmath47 signals of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) in the @xmath59 , @xmath58 , and @xmath17 channels , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath79 and @xmath80  nb ( a weighted average from @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 . the masses are found from the peak locations , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 5.5cm=5.5 cm    the same process , ckm - suppressed , leads to @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> given the lower expected rate , only @xmath59 is examined . </S>",
    "<S> kinematic similarities result in a large incursion of @xmath65 into the signal region ( figure  [ dspi](r ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> good hadron identification is thus crucial . a two - dimensional fit yields @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) events . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath89 and @xmath90 .    </S>",
    "<S> the observation of @xmath91,@xcite and similar charmonium - like particles,@xcite raises the question of whether analogous bottomonium - like particles exist in the region near and above @xmath2(10860).@xcite the @xmath92 s are observed in modes @xmath93s@xmath94 where @xmath95 is @xmath96 or @xmath97 ; their nature is not yet fully understood . </S>",
    "<S> given widths of order 10  kev for @xmath98s@xmath991s)@xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , one would navely expect @xmath1025s@xmath991s@xmath103 to be tiny , of order @xmath104 . </S>",

    "<S> peaks correponding to @xmath2(10860)@xmath105s@xmath100 are seen in projections onto @xmath110 of @xmath2 signal bands ( figure  [ fig : ynspipi](r ) ) which are fitted to determine signal yields . from these we find cross sections , branching fractions , and partial widths for four modes , assuming @xmath2(10860)=@xmath2(5s ) : ( in mev ) @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath115 widths are of order 1  mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the widths for @xmath2(2s/3s/4s/10860)@xmath116(1s)@xmath50@xcite are 0.0060 , 0.0009 , 0.0019 , and 0.59  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the rate for @xmath2(10860 ) is largest by two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> while the rate for @xmath2(5s ) could be substantially enhanced,@xcite our result raises the possibility that the @xmath2(10860 ) is not a pure @xmath2(5s ) state . to address this issue , </S>",
    "<S> belle has scanned in energy in the region above the @xmath2(10860 ) resonance and anticipates first results by summer 2008 .    </S>",
    "<S> belle has searched for @xmath51 and @xmath117.@xcite each includes a hard photon , readily isolated in the @xmath5-factory but difficult to trigger on at a hadron machine . for the standard model </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath118 is in the range @xmath119 ; extended models give rates up to @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> the belle @xmath2(10860 ) data improve the limit 20-fold over previous searches , @xmath121 ( 90%  @xmath122 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the process for @xmath117 is identical to that for @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) and is expected at this level . </S>",
    "<S> we report the first observation , @xmath125 , with a significance of 5.5@xmath126 .    in summary , belle , which was designed for precision measurements of ckm parameters , </S>",
    "<S> has opened a new avenue of inquiry by collecting 23.6  fb@xmath0 at the @xmath2(10860 ) resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the sample includes @xmath1271.3  million @xmath4 events and has yielded unprecedented sensitivity and precision for several modes . in addition , an anomaly in the rate of @xmath128s@xmath94 is stimulating new interest in bottomonium studies . </S>"
