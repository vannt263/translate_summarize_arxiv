    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) form at the end of the evolution of low- and intermediate- mass stars ( @xmath2  m@xmath3 ) , after traversing the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase and a brief ( @xmath41000 yr ) post - agb phase . during these last phases of evolution ,",
    "maser emission of different molecules ( e.g. , h@xmath0o , oh , sio ) is found in the envelope of oxygen - rich stars @xcite .",
    "the presence of maser emission is indicative of energetic processes , such as strong radiation fields and shocks . in the particular case of h@xmath0o masers ,",
    "this emission is common in oxygen - rich agb stars and originates in the inner regions of the envelope , between 10 and 100 au from the central star @xcite .",
    "it was initially thought that h@xmath0o masers disappear within @xmath5100 yr after the cessation of the strong mass loss ( @xmath510@xmath6 m@xmath3  yr@xmath7 ) typical of the agb phase @xcite .",
    "this timescale implies that it is possible to find h@xmath0o masers during the post - agb phase @xcite , albeit with a lower detection rate than in the agb phase , but they were not expected to be found after entering the pn phase .",
    "however , four pne have been found so far to harbour h@xmath0o masers : iras 19255@xmath82123 ( k3@xmath135 ) @xcite , iras 17347@xmath13139 @xcite , iras 18061@xmath12505 @xcite , and iras 15103@xmath15754 @xcite .",
    "all these h@xmath0o maser - emitting pne ( hereafter h@xmath0o - pne ) exhibit a bipolar morphology in the optical , infrared and/or radio continuum images with signs of point - symmetry , suggesting that precessing bipolar jets could be involved in their formation @xcite .",
    "in these objects , the h@xmath0o masers are usually located towards the central region ( within @xmath5200 au ) , mostly aligned in a direction perpendicular to the main nebular axis defined by the bipolar lobes @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that these masers are related to dense equatorial structures ( discs or toroids ) around the central star @xcite , although in iras 19255@xmath82123 ( k3@xmath135 ) h@xmath0o maser emission was also detected at a few thousand au from the centre associated with the tips of the precessing bipolar jets in the object @xcite . in iras 15103@xmath15754",
    "the maser emission shows a completely different pattern , since it mainly traces a high - velocity ( @xmath580 km  s@xmath7 ) , collimated jet @xcite .",
    "this pattern allows the classification of iras 15103@xmath15754 as a `` water fountain '' , a class of sources that mainly includes post - agb stars @xcite .",
    "given the different structures traced by the maser emission , pne with h@xmath0o masers are key to understand the change in the mass - loss regime in the transition from the agb to the pn phase .",
    "furthermore , h@xmath0o - pne are most probably among the youngest pne and , therefore , their study and the confirmation of new cases are crucial to understand the earliest stages of pn evolution .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed a single - dish survey of h@xmath0o masers towards post - agb stars and young pn candidates .",
    "their goal was to relate the presence of h@xmath0o masers with the evolutionary stage and the characteristics of the sources observed .",
    "the observations of the northernmost sources ( surez et al .",
    "2007 ) led to the detection of h@xmath0o maser emission towards the pn iras 18061@xmath12505 , later confirmed with the very large array @xcite .",
    "for the southern part of the survey @xcite , two additional sources catalogued as possible pne , iras 16333@xmath14807 and iras 12405@xmath16219 @xcite , were found to be probably associated with h@xmath0o maser emission .",
    "however , the lack of enough angular resolution of the single - dish observations prevented to establish a clear association .",
    "in this paper we present simultaneous observations of h@xmath0o maser emission and radio continuum at 1.3 cm carried out with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) towards iras 16333@xmath14807 and iras 12405@xmath16219 .",
    "our main goal was to confirm the association of h@xmath0o maser emission , previously detected with the parkes antenna @xcite , with these two pn candidates .",
    "observations were carried out with the atca in its 6a configuration on 2013 february 12 .",
    "the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ) of atca provides two independent if bands of @xmath9 ghz each , in dual linear polarisation . in our case",
    ", these two bands were centred at 22 and 24 ghz .",
    "we used the 64 m mode of cabb , which samples each if band into 32 wideband channels of 64 mhz each .",
    "the wideband channel containing the @xmath10 transition of the water molecule ( rest frequency = 22235.08 mhz ) was then zoomed in , by sampling it into 2048 channels , which provides a velocity resolution of @xmath40.42 km s@xmath7 , and a total coverage of @xmath4860 km s@xmath7 for the spectral line .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "we used pks 1253 - 055 as the bandpass calibrator .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was set using pks 1934 - 638 as the reference .",
    "the uncertainty in the flux calibration is @xmath11% .",
    "all broadband ( continuum ) data were calibrated and imaged with the miriad package . to obtain the continuum maps presented in the figures of this paper",
    ", we processed together the whole 4 ghz frequency coverage , flagging out the broadband channel containing the maser emission .",
    "dirty maps of the continuum emission were obtained with task `` invert '' of miriad , applying frequency synthesis and a robust parameter of 0.5 .",
    "images were subsequently deconvolved with the clean algorithm , as implemented in task `` mfclean '' .",
    "self - calibration was applied to these continuum images to improve their dynamic range .",
    "final rms noise in the continuum maps were @xmath12 @xmath13jy  beam@xmath7 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we detected h@xmath0o maser emission with a single spectral component ( fig .",
    "1 ) at @xmath1450 km  s@xmath7 and a flux density of 910@xmath1590 mjy located at ra(j2000)@xmath16 ,",
    "dec(j2000)@xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 ( @xmath20 )",
    ". a source of radio continuum emission at 1.3 cm is detected with a peak position at ra(j2000)@xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 , dec(j2000)@xmath24 ( @xmath20 ) and flux density of 102@xmath1510 mjy .",
    "this radio continuum emission seems to be associated with the near - ir emission , which is located at ra(j2000)@xmath21@xmath22@xmath25 , dec(j2000)@xmath26 ( source 2mass j12433151 - 6236135 in the 2mass point source catalog , @xmath27 positional uncertainty @xmath28 ) .",
    "the radio continuum emission shows a cometary morphology ( fig .",
    "3 ) similar to that of the infrared emission @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0o maser is located @xmath56 arcsec southeast from the radio continuum source , showing that these emissions are not spatially associated .",
    "images from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) database show mid - ir emission that is dominated at all bands by the radio continuum source , but at the longest wise wavelength ( 22 @xmath13 m ) there is a weak extension towards the location of the h@xmath0o maser .",
    "this suggests that the maser is probably associated with a different , highly obscured source .",
    "as already mentioned , iras 12405@xmath16219 was classified as a pn candidate from its radio continuum emission @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite argue that the object is an hii region . in particular , the cometary morphology observed at 1.3 cm and mid - ir images is unusual in pne but common to hii regions .",
    "the object is associated with extended and filamentary emission in near - ir images , as typically observed in young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "these properties strongly support the classification of iras 12405@xmath16219 as an hii region . regardless of the exact nature of the source",
    ", we can certainly rule out that the object is an h@xmath0o - pn , given the non - association between the maser and radio continuum emission .",
    "6219 at 1.3 cm from atca .",
    "the contours are 8 , 15 , 25 , 40 , 80 , 120 , 200 , 300 , 400 , and 550 times @xmath29 jy beam@xmath7 .",
    "the cross indicates the position of the infrared source 2mass j12433151 - 6236135 .",
    "the size of the cross represents the @xmath27 positional uncertainty .",
    "the position of the h@xmath0o maser , which is clearly not associated with the continuum emission , is indicated by a filled diamond located near the bottom left corner of the figure .",
    "the synthesized beam is shown at the bottom right corner . ,",
    "the presence of radio continuum emission and the infrared colours of this source are compatible with it being a pn but it could also be a massive yso . in fact , it was included in the red msx source ( rms ) survey @xcite as a candidate massive yso , based on its msx colours .",
    "the rms database , however , indicates that it is a pn .",
    "the source is relatively isolated in infrared and submillimetre images ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the rms database ) . specially in the case of mid- and far- infrared images , ysos are associated with extended and filamentary structures , which are not present in iras 16333@xmath14807 .",
    "moreover , as shown in the rms database , there is no @xmath30co emission towards the source @xcite , whose presence would be expected in the case of a yso embedded in a molecular cloud .",
    "this confirms that the source is an evolved object .",
    "iras 16333@xmath14807 exhibits a distinct bipolar morphology in the near- @xcite , mid - ir @xcite , and radio continuum images ( fig .",
    "2 ) . this morphology is common in post - agb stars and pne , but it is rare in hii regions . to ascertain its nature as a pn ,",
    "as opposed to being a post - agb star , we have to confirm the presence of photoionization .",
    "considering the flux density we determined at @xmath31 ghz ( @xmath32 mjy ) and that obtained by @xcite at 5 ghz ( 32.5 mjy ) , we estimate a spectral index of @xmath33 for the radio continuum emission between those frequencies .",
    "this spectral index is similar to the one obtained for the h@xmath0o - pn iras 17347@xmath13139 @xcite and clearly indicates that the radio continuum is of thermal origin . although such spectral indices may also arise from ionized jets , the flux density in iras 16333@xmath14807 is too high to be explained in this way with reasonable mass - loss rates . as in the case of iras 17347@xmath13139 @xcite , a mass loss rate of @xmath34 m@xmath35 yr@xmath7 , where @xmath36 is the distance to the source , would be required for a spherical ionized wind to explain the observed radio continuum emission @xcite . even assuming a collimated wind , and following the formulation by @xcite , the required mass loss rate is as high as @xmath37 m@xmath35 yr@xmath7 , and this is a lower limit , assuming that the wind is fully ionized . despite the uncertainty in the distance ,",
    "such mass loss rates are significantly higher than that expected from the central stars of pne and post - agb stars ( @xmath38 m@xmath35 yr@xmath7 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the only remaining possibility to explain the observed radio continuum emission in iras 16333@xmath14807 is that it arises from a photoionized region , confirming that the object is a pn .",
    "the main result of this paper is the confirmation of iras 16333@xmath14807 as a h@xmath0o - pn .",
    "this is the fifth object that is considered a bona fide h@xmath0o - pn .",
    "as mentioned above , it was previously thought that h@xmath0o maser emission could not be present in pne .",
    "however , a population of such sources is now being uncovered .",
    "the presence of h@xmath0o masers in pne may not be such a rare case after all , but it could represent a usual but short phase in the evolution of some types of pne .    although the known number of this type of sources is still scarce , such number is growing , and now we can start to study them as a group .",
    "their most outstanding common characteristic is that all five h@xmath0o - pne have bipolar morphologies in their infrared and/or optical images .",
    "so , h@xmath0o - pne might pertain to a usual phase in the evolution of bipolar pne .",
    "other than that , among the five h@xmath0o - pne there are some interesting differences , although there is a relatively homogeneous subgroup of three of them ( iras 19255@xmath82123 ( k3@xmath135 ) , iras 17347@xmath13139 , and iras 16333@xmath14807 ) that may be considered as representative .",
    "these three sources are all strongly obscured , and their h@xmath0o maser emission appears close to the central star , probably tracing a circumstellar torus .",
    "we note that the h@xmath0o masers at the tips of the bipolar lobes observed in iras 19255@xmath82123 ( k3@xmath135 ) have not been seen in subsequent observations of the source @xcite which suggests that this particular characteristic could be a transient phenomenon in h@xmath0o - pne . moreover , these are the only three h@xmath0o - pne in which the photoionized gas traced by the radio continuum emission shows a bipolar morphology similar to that seen in optical and infrared images .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed a simple evolutionary schema for h@xmath0o masers in evolved stars ( 5@xmath18 m@xmath3 ) , considering their location in the nebula and their radial velocities .",
    "first , in the agb phase , low - velocity h@xmath0o maser emission arises from the spherical shell .",
    "later on , during the late agb or post - agb phase , the anisotropic mass - loss starts , which is characterised by h@xmath0o masers tracing high - velocity jets , marking the entrance in the `` water fountain '' phase . in some water fountains",
    "there are also masers tracing equatorial structures @xcite , in addition to the ones along jets",
    ". the next phase would be the one in which water fountain jets are quenched , while h@xmath0o masers survive only in dense equatorial regions .",
    "considering this evolutionary schema , among the five known h@xmath0o - pne , iras 15103@xmath15754 @xcite would be clearly younger than the rest , since its maser emission still traces the collimated jets typical of `` water fountains '' .",
    "the subgroup of h@xmath0o - pne , iras ( k3@xmath135 ) , iras 17347@xmath13139 , and iras 16333@xmath14807 , would be in a somewhat later evolutionary stage .",
    "finally , iras 18061@xmath12505 would be more evolved since it is completely visible in the optical @xcite , showing at this wavelength the central star and two bipolar lobes with a total extension of @xmath39 arcsec ( @xmath40 au at the distance of 1.3 kpc ) .",
    "in iras 16333@xmath14807 , the detected h@xmath0o masers are associated with the radio continuum emission at 1.3 cm and are observed towards the centre of the object .",
    "the properties of iras 16333@xmath14807 indicate a pn nature , making it the fifth known pn with h@xmath0o maser emission .",
    "the object shows a bipolar morphology , as the other four h@xmath0o - pne .",
    "this result further supports the idea that h@xmath0o masers in pne are not the remnant of masers in the agb phase but are excited by energetic phenomena associated with the formation of pne .    in iras 12405@xmath16219",
    ", the h@xmath0o maser emission is not associated with the radio continuum emission at 1.3 cm .",
