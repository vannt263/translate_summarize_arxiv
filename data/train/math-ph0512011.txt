    "subduction coefficients for symmetric groups were first introduced in 1953 by elliot _ et al _  @xcite to describe the states of a physical system with @xmath2 identical particles as composed of two subsystems with @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles respectively ( @xmath5 ) .",

    "it is clear that we can associate each sdc of @xmath17\\downarrow [ \\lambda_1 ] \\otimes [ \\lambda_2]$ ] to a node of @xmath108 in a one - to - one correspondence .",
    "supposed @xmath145 as a fixed pole of a crossing configuration and @xmath133 the set of all nodes of such a configuration , the solutions of the equations ( [ subdeqr ] ) , written for each @xmath146 , are the kernel vectors of the matrix @xmath147 where the following relations hold : @xmath148 ( they directly discend from @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) .",
    "if we put @xmath151 @xmath152 and we remember ( [ sim ] ) , then ( [ subdeqrid ] ) can be written as @xmath153 where @xmath154 denotes the @xmath155 identity matrix .",

    "we can have two possibilities : @xmath184 or @xmath185 the kernel is the one - dimensional space generated by the vector @xmath186 or it is the trivial space .",

    "@xmath187 matrices _ and the solution for the kernel vectors .",
    "notice that , for the crossing configuration we distinguish the case @xmath188 from the case @xmath189 . in the latter case",

    "let us consider the crossing configuration .",
    "we first notice that @xmath191 where @xmath192 .",
    "then , observing that @xmath193 , for the other three choices of pole we have @xmath194 @xmath195 @xmath196 in any case we are able to find the suitable change of basis .",
    "of course , for the bridge configurations the change of pole is equivalent to a change of basis by @xmath197 . the singlet configuration is a trivial case .",
    "we can now write the explicit solution space @xmath198 for ( [ subdeqr ] ) as a suitable subspace of @xmath199 . if we define the vectors ( in components ) @xmath200 @xmath201 @xmath202 and the spaces @xmath203 denoted by @xmath204 the set of the poles for the @xmath41-layer and observing that the set of the configurations for the @xmath41-layer is a partition of the grid , we have @xmath205 so the general solution of ( [ subdeq ] ) is the intersection of @xmath141 subspaces , i.e. @xmath206 with @xmath207 .",
    "now we can outline an algorithm ( in pseudo - code ) to determine the sdcs for @xmath17 \\downarrow [ \\lambda_1 ] \\otimes [ \\lambda_2]$ ] :    1 .   for @xmath208",
    ": 1 .   construct the @xmath41-layer ; 2 .",

    "construct @xmath210 by ( [ ilayerdec ] ) ; 2 .",
    "determine @xmath78 as intersection of all @xmath210 .",
    "step ( ii ) can be performed by using the subduction graph to obtain a minimal number of equations .",
    "in fact , one may associate a suitable equation deriving from ( [ ilayerdec1 ] ) to each edge ( two for the crossing ) of the graph ( nodes represents the unknown sdcs ) . then , starting from a suitable node in the graph , we can extract such equations by applying a graph searching algorithm which is able to reach every edge  @xcite . as regard",
    "it is useful to notice that equations associated to closed loops of bridge configurations are always linearly dependent .",
    "the subduction space given by ( [ ilayerdec1 ] ) has dimension @xmath211 equal to the multiplicity of @xmath17 \\downarrow [ \\lambda_1 ] \\otimes [ \\lambda_2]$ ] .",
    "then sdcs are not univocally determined .",
    "a choice of orthonormality between the different copies of multiplicity imposes a precise form for the multiplicity separations .",
    "let @xmath212 be a basis in the subduction space .",
    "orthonormality implies for the scalar products : @xmath213 if we denote by @xmath78 the matrix which has the basis vectors of the subduction space as columns , we may orthonormalize it by a suitable @xmath214 matrix @xmath215 , i.e. @xmath216 in ( [ orton ] ) @xmath217 is the matrix which has the orthonormalized basis vectors of the subduction space as columns .",
    "now we can write ( [ on ] ) as @xmath218 where @xmath154 is the @xmath219 identity matrix and @xmath220 is the @xmath219 positive defined quadratic form given by @xmath221 from ( [ silv ] ) we can see @xmath215 as the sylvester matrix of @xmath220 , i.e. the matrix for the change of basis that reduces @xmath220 in the identity form .",
    "we can express @xmath215 in terms of the orthonormal matrix @xmath222 that diagonalizes @xmath220 @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues given by the inverse square root of the eigenvalues of @xmath220 and @xmath225 a _",
    "generic _ orthogonal matrix .",
    "thus , the general form for the orthonormalized @xmath78 is @xmath226    ( [ genchi ] ) suggests some considerations on the form of the sdcs .",
    "first we notice that in case of multiplicity - free subduction , only one choice of global phase has to be made ( for example young - yamanouchi phase convention  @xcite ) .",
    "it derives from the trivial form of the orthogonal @xmath227 matrices @xmath225 and @xmath222 .    in the general case of multiplicity @xmath228 ,",
    "@xmath229 phases deriving from the @xmath222 matrix and @xmath96 phase from the matrix @xmath225 have to be fixed .",
    "therefore we have @xmath230 phases to choose .",
    "furthermore we have other @xmath231 degrees of freedom deriving from @xmath225 . in sum",
    "we have a total of @xmath232 choices to make .",
    "we agree with  @xcite for the case of multiplicity @xmath8 , in which we need three phases and one extra parameter to govern the multiplicity separation .",
    "other aspects have to be considered if we want to find the simplest and most natural form for these symmetric group transformation coefficients . in  @xcite the authors",
    "expose the following suitable requirements :    1 .",
    "the trasformation coefficients should be chosen to be real if possible ; 2 .",
    "phases and the multiplicity separation should be chosen to be indipendent from @xmath2 ; 3 .",
    "the multiplicity separation is to be chosen so that a maximal number of zero coefficients is obtained ; 4 .",
    "it is desirable to have the coefficients written as a single surd of the form @xmath233 , with @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 integers ; 5 .",
    "the prime numbers which occur in the surds should be as small as possible .",
    "the first two statements are automatically verified if we assume ( [ genchi ] ) .",
    "the last three heavily depend on the form of @xmath220",
    ". this can be an interesting mathematical point to study ( but its relevance is relative from a purely physical point of view ) .",
    "we think the form of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath220 are the only important factors in this regard .",
    "non - normalized sdcs deriving from ( [ ilayerdec1 ] ) seem always to be in a _",
    "simple _ form .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the linear equation method for symmetric groups , proposed by chen _",
    "et al _ for the determination of the sdcs as solution of a linear system .",
    "we have proven that such a system , which is constituted by a complicated primal structure of dependent linear equations , can be simplified by choosing a minimal set of sufficient equations related to the concept of subduction graph .",
    "furthermore , the subduction graph provides a very practical way to choose such equations and it suggests that subduction coefficients may be seen as a subspace of @xmath11 obtained by the intersection of only @xmath141 explicit subspaces ( each one in corrispondence with an @xmath41-layer ) instead of the original @xmath81 ones .",
    "consequently we have a more explicit insight into the structure of the standard to split basis transformation .",
    "we have proposed a general form for the sdcs resulting from the only requirement of orthonormality and we have seen that the multiplicity separation can be described in terms of the sylvester matrix of the positive defined quadratic form @xmath220 describing the scalar product in the subduction space",
    ". then we are able to link the freedom in fixing the multiplicity separation to the freedom deriving from the choice of the sylvester matrix",
    ". the number of phases and free factors for the general multiplicity separation can be expressed as function of the multiplicity @xmath211 ( i.e. the dimension of the subduction space ) .",
    "it seems to be a crucial question if one may fix the sylvester matrix to obtain all the requirements of _ simplicity _ given in the previous section for the form of each coefficient .",
    "we conjecture that such a form only depends on the form of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath220 .",
    "we are going to implement a mathematica code which uses the results in this paper to easily provide the sdcs relative to high dimension irreps .",
    "an interesting example is @xmath237 \\downarrow [ 3,2,1 ] \\otimes [ 3,1]$ ] , because it represents the first case of symmetric groups subduction with multiplicity three and the corresponding sdcs are still unknown .",
    "other aspects that could be investigated with interest are the following .",
    "first , the possibility of giving an explicit description of the intersection subspace ( [ ilayerdec1 ] ) to achieve a comprehensive algebraic solution of the subduction system .",
    "second , the way to choose the sylvester matrix to fix the multiplicity separation .",
    "third , we think that the subduction graph approach can be useful to other subduction problems such as those related to brauer algebras and quantum groups , which are important in many physical models . moreover the results of this paper can be directly applied to the subduction problem in hecke algebras  @xcite .",
