    "understanding the content and distribution of cold gas in galaxies is an important step to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "ugc8802 is an interesting target selected from the _ galex arecibo sdss survey ( gass ) @xcite .",
    "one interesting aspect is its cold gas content .",
    "ugc8802 is a disk galaxy with stellar mass @xmath0 , while its hi mass is estimated to be as high as @xmath1 @xcite and its molecular gas mass is only about one - tenth of its hi mass @xcite . compared to other disk galaxies in this stellar mass range , the high neutral gas content of ugc8802 is uncommon @xcite .",
    "why ugc8802 has such high neutral gas fraction and how ugc8802 acquires its cold gas are still open questions @xcite .",
    "_    another interesting aspect of ugc8802 is its flat profile of the star formation rate ( sfr ) @xcite .",
    "the sfr surface densities of ` normal ' disk galaxies typically decrease ( sometimes exponentially ) from the center to the outer regions of the disk , such as the milky way , m31 , etc @xcite . besides the flat sfr profile",
    ", @xcite found that ugc8802 shows a steeper radial oxygen gradient than the average gradient of the gass sample .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to explain these observed results under the frame of the current models of galaxy formation and evolution . for individual disk galaxy , parameterized modeling is proven to be fruitful in exploring their galactic formation and evolution @xcite . in this letter , we construct such a parameterized model to investigate the radial - dependent star formation history ( sfh ) of ugc8802 and so as to explore its growth history .",
    "our model is based on that of @xcite . here",
    "we emphasize main ingredients of the model , especially some revisions .",
    "we adopt the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the galactic disk is sheet - like and composed by a set of independent rings , each 500pc wide .",
    "the disk originates through continuous gas - infall from the dark halo .",
    "we assume that the disk begins to form at 12.5 @xmath4 ago , which roughly corresponds to @xmath5 under the standard cosmology . at given radius @xmath6 ,",
    "the gas infall rate @xmath7 ( in units of @xmath8 ) is assumed to be gaussian in time @xcite : @xmath9 ^ 2/2\\sigma^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the infall - peak time and @xmath11 is the scatter .",
    "we adopt @xmath10 to be free and set @xmath12 since the model results are insensitive to varying @xmath11 in the @xmath13 range @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 are a set of separate quantities normalized by the stellar mass surface density of present - day @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the cosmic age and set to be @xmath17 according to the adopted cosmology .",
    "the stellar mass of ugc8802 and its disk scale - length at the present time are adopted to be @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we assume that the galaxy ugc8802 at present is a pure - disk system and @xmath15 follows an exponential profile , and so that the central stellar mass surface density is given as @xmath20 .",
    "the star formation ( sf ) law is one of the key ingredients of our disk galaxy formation model .",
    "@xcite found a power - law relationship between the galaxy - averaged sfr surface density and the galaxy - averaged total gas surface density , which is often called as the classical kennicutt - schmidt sf law and has been widely used in the chemical evolution models of the disk galaxy formation .",
    "later , extended analyses to kpc - scale regions within several local group galaxies show that the sfr surface density correlates stronger with the surface density of molecular hydrogen than that of atomic hydrogen @xcite .    in this study , we adopt a recently observed molecular surface density related sf law ( hereafter , it is termed as the @xmath21-based sf law ) , that is , the sfr surface density @xmath22 is linearly proportional to the molecular hydrogen surface density @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the molecular gas depletion time .",
    "@xcite and @xcite derived a constant molecular gas depletion time as @xmath26 in their sample , while @xcite found the non - universality of @xmath25 in galaxies in the co legacy database for the gass ( cold gass ) sample .",
    "@xcite found that the strongest dependence of @xmath25 is on the stellar mass and the mean @xmath25 is parameterized as log@xmath27 . according to this relation , we adopt @xmath28 for ugc8802 .    regarding the molecular - to - atomic mass fraction @xmath29",
    ", @xcite obtained an empirical fit relation : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mid - plane pressure , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are fitting constants and we adopt @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the pressure is estimated to include gas self - gravity @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total gas surface density , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the vertical velocity dispersion of gas and stars .",
    "we adopt @xmath40 @xcite , while @xmath39 is estimated as [ see appendix b of @xcite for details ] : @xmath41    a similar @xmath21-based sf law has been successfully adopted in the semi - analytical model of galaxy formation by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also use the @xmath21-based sf law to explore the chemical evolution and sfh of m33 and find that , comparing to the model adopting the classical kennicutt - schmidt sf law , the model adopting the @xmath21-based sf law predicts steeper color and matellicity gradients , which are more consistent with the observations .",
    "other components of the model , such as the initial mass faction ( imf ) , chemical evolution , etc .",
    ", are the same as that of @xcite .",
    "we also consider the contribution of gas outflow process by assuming that the gas outflow rate is proportional to the sfr and the coefficient is set to be @xmath42 according to the mass - dependent model of @xcite .",
    "we point out that our final results are insensitive to the variation of @xmath43 since ugc8802 is a massive galaxy and the gas outflow process is not a dominant process of its chemical evolution .",
    "we emphasize that our model only has one free parameter , the infall - peak time @xmath10 . in @xcite , @xmath44 is assumed to be a function of galactic stellar mass and do not vary with radius . in the case of ugc8802 ,",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is a function of radius since we will further consider the radial profiles of the ugc8802 rather than the global properties of galaxies as that in @xcite .",
    "since the formalizing of @xmath45 regulates the shape of sfhs along the disk , we aim to get the constraints on @xmath45 from the observed properties of ugc8802 and then get insights on its growth history .",
    "we present our results step by step .",
    "firstly , we summarize main observational properties of ugc8802 , and then explore the influence of the free parameter on our results . finally , we present a viable model to discuss the radial - dependent sfh of ugc8802 .",
    "the observed data of the radial profiles of ugc8802 are adopted mainly from @xcite and plotted in fig .",
    "1 . since our model only has the galactic - center distance and can not distinguish the negative position from the positive one , we plot the observed data of the negative and positive positions as open triangles and filled squares in fig .",
    "1 , respectively .",
    "the nuv - r color profile of ugc8802 is measured using sdss and galex photometry @xcite , but the data has not been corrected for dust - attenuation .",
    "the observed data of oxygen abundance @xmath46 , the sfr surface density and @xmath47 are obtained from the long - slit spectroscopy of ugc8802 @xcite .",
    "the data @xmath48 are estimated from the observed sfrs and the stellar surface density @xmath15 by assuming @xmath49 fraction of the total formed stellar mass are locked in the stellar mass in the present day , where @xmath50 is the return fraction and we set @xmath51 according to the adopted imf .",
    "the comparison between model predictions of the radial profiles and the observations are presented in fig.1 .",
    "the dash and dash - dot lines are model results of two limiting cases of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively",
    ". the case @xmath52 ( dash lines ) corresponds to a time - decreasing gas - infall process that most of the gas has been accreted in the early stage of its history , while that of @xmath53 ( dash - dot lines ) represents a time - increasing gas accretion that there is still a large fraction of cold gas - infall at the present time .",
    "1 shows that the model predictions are very sensitive to the adopted @xmath10 .",
    "the model adopting the later infall - peak time ( dash - dot lines ) predicts the higher surface density of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the higher sfr and specific sfr , the lower gas - phase metallicity , the older mean stellar age and the bluer color .",
    "these results are straightforward , the later @xmath10 corresponds to a more recent gas infall and then results in a younger stellar population and a higher fraction of cold gas in present .     and",
    "@xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the solid lines plot the predictions of the viable model , which adopts @xmath56 .",
    "the observed data are described in details in the text . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=302 ] +    fig .",
    "1 also shows that the area between the dash and dash - dot lines almost covers the locations of the observed data .",
    "there is a trend that the observed data at the inner region approaches the dash lines ( the early @xmath10 ) and the data at the outer regions approaches the dash - dot lines ( the late @xmath10 ) .",
    "after a set of calculations and comparisons , we select a viable model by adopting an inside - out formation scenario @xmath57 and plot its model results as solid lines in fig .",
    "1 . this model predicts @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which in good agreement with the observed values [ @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xcite ] , considering the observed uncertainties .",
    "our model - predicted @xmath62 colors are systematically bluer than the observed ones , which is also reasonable since the observed @xmath62 color has not been corrected for dust - attenuation and our model predictions are dust free .    , while the dash line shows the observed trend of size evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "the bottom panel shows the normalized evolution history of different baryonic components , including the stellar mass ( the solid line ) , the atomic hydrogen mass @xmath63 ( the dash line ) and the molecular hydrogen mass @xmath64 ( the dot line).,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=264 ] +    the good consistence between our model predictions and the observations implies that the continue gas - infall model is also viable for the ` peculiar ' ugc8802 , which has steeper metallicity gradient , flatter sfr profile and extraordinary higher neutral gas fraction than normal disk galaxies .",
    "the key ingredient of this successful model is that the infall - peak time @xmath45 increases from @xmath65 in the innermost disk to 12.5gyr at the out region around @xmath66 .",
    "that means the formation of ugc8802 is quite late and the disk growing is still ongoing .",
    "in fact , this scenario is the well - known idea that the disk forms inside - out and has also been applied in previous models of formation and evolution of disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "the above results have shown that the inside - out growth scenario can nicely reproduce the main observed properties of ugc8802 . in fig .",
    "2 , we show further predictions of the growth history of the ugc8802 of this established model . the upper panel of fig.2 shows the model predicted time evolution of the half - size stellar mass @xmath67 ( solid line ) , which is defined as the radius where contains half of the total stellar mass .",
    "as we can see , our model predicts that the half - size of ugc8802 increases almost linearly with time , which is also globally consistent with the observations of the average size evolution trend of the massive galaxies [ @xmath68 , @xcite , dash line ] .",
    "this size growth is actually another angle of view of the disk inside - out formation scenario .    in the bottom panel , we plot the model predictions of the evolution of the different mass components , which includes the stellar mass @xmath69 ( solid line ) , the atomic hydrogen mass @xmath63 ( dash line ) and the molecular hydrogen mass @xmath64 ( dot line )",
    "the quantities are normalized by its value at the present - day . the bottom panel of fig .",
    "2 shows that , in the early epoch , with the continue infall of cold gas ( mainly in the form of the atomic gas ) , the molecular gas accumulates faster , while the accumulation of stellar mass is lagged behind .",
    "later , the mass of the molecular gas becomes to be asymptotic , while the growth rate of stellar mass is speeded .",
    "indeed , half of the stellar mass has been accumulated during the last @xmath70 . to sum up , our results suggest that ugc8802 is a young galaxy and still active in star formation processes .",
    "in this work , we build a bridge for disk galaxy ugc8802 between its observed properties and its growth history by constructing a simple chemical evolution model . we find that a late infall - peak time @xmath10 , which corresponds to a recent gas - infall process , is necessary to explain the observed high atomic and molecular gas content of ugc8802 . the model adopting an inside - out formation scenario @xmath57 and the @xmath21-based sf law can reproduce the observed radial profiles of ugc8802 very well .",
    "this consistency does encourage us that our simple model is viable for such a ` peculiar ' galaxy .",
    "this result implies that there should be no violent star burst process ( e.g. the major merging ) during the growth history of ugc8802 . according to our model ,",
    "half of the stellar mass of ugc8802 may have been accumulated during the last @xmath70 and the sf process of the outer disk is still active . the physics behind the very young history of ugc8802 may related to its environment , however , which is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "the success of our simple model on the case of ugc8802 implies that the observed properties of the gas - rich galaxies might also be well modeled by ` tuning the knob ' on gas inflow with a single parameter .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite find that the color and metallicty of the outer region of the galaxies strongly correlate with its total atomic mass @xmath63 , i.e. , the higher the @xmath63 , the bluer the color , the lower the metallicity . in our story , the high atomic gas fraction of gas - rich galaxy may be the result of a late and smooth gas accretion history , and the bluer color and lower metallicity of its outer region are embedded in the disk inside - out formation scenario .",
    "we will further explore these questions in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for suggestions to greatly improve this paper .",
