    ". the equation ( 1 ) represents the general form of an evolution equation for a quantum system which satisfies markov property .    however , this theoretical approach to the dynamics of open quantum systems is not unique . in real experiments",
    "it is often useful to understand and model the dynamics of pure quantum states @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "indeed , the evolution of an open system can be described directly in terms of the dynamics of the system s pure state .",
    "the corresponding evolution equation is a stochastic modification of the unitary schroedinger equation .",

    "the stochastic evolution of pure states provides valuable insides which can not be inferred from the density matrix approach @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "there are two main approaches to the unravelling of the linblad master equation : the method of quantum state diffusion @xcite and the relative state method @xcite , @xcite , with specific advantages associated with each of the methods .",
    "the relative state method is usually used do describe the situations when the measurement is the dominant interaction with the environment .",
    "the method offers particular flexibility in that the master equation can be unravelled into different stochastic equations conditioned on the results of measurement . on the other hand",
    "the correspondence between the qsd equations and the linblad master equations is unique , and is not related to a particular measurement scheme , or the form of the markov environment .",
    "the resulting sse is always of the form of a diffusion process on the hilbert space of pure states , which is its main property to be explored in this paper .",
    "we shall concentrate on the unique unravelling of the master equation given by the quantum state diffusion equation , and explore the fact that it represents a diffusion process .",

    "it will be shown , using examples of the dephasing and thermal environments and the measurement of an observable , that the curvature of the diffusion metric is a good indicator of the properties of the environment dominated evolution and its stability .",
    "we shall see that the curvature maxima of the diffusion metric coincide with the states that are preferred by the particular type of the environment .",
    "furthermore , if the maxima are sharp and positive the stochastic dynamics governed by the environment and a hamiltonian perturbation that does not commute with @xmath4 , is likely to be attracted to the state with the maximal ( positive ) curvature . on the other hand the states that correspond to the negative values of the curvature",
    "are unstable .",
    "our analyzes of the qsd equation , and the results , are strictly related to the fact that the equation represent a norm - preserving diffusion process , and in this sense are applicable to the stochastic modifications of the schroedinger equation that describe a norm - preserving diffusion on the hilbert space of pure states , like the qsd equation and , for example , the equations of the spontaneous collapse models @xcite .",

    "the drift and the diffusion are such that the norm of the vectors in @xmath16 is preserved .",

    "the first two are represented by hermitian and the third one by a non - hermitian linblad operators .",
    "the main geometrical object which we shall study are the diffusion metric norm of a state vector and its scalar curvature . in order to illustrate how these objects depend on the environment we shall use the simplest but important quantum system , namely a single qubit .",

    "g_{24}=0,\\ > g_{33}=g_{11},\\ > g_{34}=g_{21},\\ > g_{44}=g_{22 } ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for the measurement of @xmath105 @xmath106    these formulas are used to compute the diffusion metric norm and the scalar curvature as functions of the state parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we shall first consider the dependence of the stated properties of the diffusion metric on the type of the environment and the coupling strengths @xmath109 and then analyze the relation between these properties and the stochastic dynamics of the state vectors .    in figures 1 and 2",
    "we illustrate the diffusion metric norm and curvature considered as functions on the sphere of states fixed by the type of environment and the value of the corresponding coupling @xmath109 .",
    "consider first figure 1 .",
    "the first row ( fig .",
    "( a),(c),(e ) ) represent the diffusion metric norm and the second row ( fig .",
    "( b),(d),(f ) ) the curvature for the three types of the environments and for some typical fixed values of the corresponding coupling strengths .",
    "the curvature is not constant , and can be positive or negative depending on the state vector and on the coupling strength . the maxima of the curvature can be sharp like in the cases of the dephasing and measurement of @xmath110 . on the other hand , in the thermal case the maxima is surrounded by a large neighborhood of states with almost maximal value of the curvature .",
    "thus , the curvature has a sharp maxima only at the states which are clearly favored by the environment .",
    "if there are no such states the curvature maximum differs very little from the neighboring values .",
    "the curvature minima are at the states that are like repellers for the environment dominated dynamics .",
    "dependence of the curvature maxima and the norm on the coupling strength is illustrated in figure 2 for the dephasing and the thermal environments .",
    "the most important information from these figures is that in the dephasing and measurement ( not shown ) cases there are clearly sharp values of corresponding coupling strength where the curvature maxima goes from negative to positive values . also , we see that the curvature minima are negative for all values of the coupling strength",
    ".    we shall now study the relation between the sign of the curvature maxima and a stability of the stochastic dynamics of the state vector .",
    "the relation will not be analyzed in a mathematically rigorous way using an appropriate notion of the stochastic stability and considering the evolution of the metric as a stochastic process governed by the process @xmath5 .",
    "instead , our strategy is to compute the curvature along different sample paths and see if the path remains near the state corresponding to the curvature maxima .",
    "we do such computations for the evolution governed by the environment and an additional fixed small hamiltonian , and we pay special attention to the case when the linblad operators and the hamiltonian do not commute .",
    "the computations are repeated for the values of the coupling to the environment slightly above and below the critical value when the curvature maxima is zero .",
    "if the hamiltonian perturbation is zero the sample paths that started near a maximum of the curvature remain near this maximum . for very small",
    "added hamiltonian part and for a fixed value of the coupling to the environment , the sample paths of the system could wonder away from the maximum or could remain near it .",
    "in the former case we shall say that the stochastic dynamics is unstable and in the later case it is stable .",
    "the relevant computations are illustrated in figures 3 and 4 .    in the case of the dephasing environment ( or the measurement of @xmath99 ) , when the maxima of the curvature are sharply picked , figures 3 clearly illustrate that positive curvature maxima correspond to the stability and negative to instability in the above mentioned sense . on the other hand , in the thermal case ,",
    "the dynamics is always unstable even if there is no hamiltonian perturbation .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "we can conclude that the diffusion metric curvature provides us with a clear picture of the qualitative properties of the system s dynamics under strong influence of the environment .",
    "it is well known that if the linblad operators are hermitian and commute with the hamiltonian , than the attractors of the stochastic qsd dynamics are the common eigenstates of the hamiltonian and the linblad operators @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the curvature maxima coincide with the eigenstates of the linblad operators , and consequently with the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "the probability of convergence to one of the attractors is , in this case , determined solely by the distance of the initial state from the attractor eigenstate , that is by the quantum mechanical transition probability , and does not depend on the parameters of the hamiltonian and stochastic terms .",
    "the sign of the curvature maxima has no effect on this probability .",
    "this is the reason why we expected that the relevance of the sign of the curvature maxima on the stochastic stability is manifested if the linblad operator and the hamiltonian perturbation do not commute .",
    "this expectation is qualitatively confirmed , as we described and illustrated in figures 3 and 4 , by numerical computations .",
    "observations of numerical sample paths , when the linblad and the hamiltonian operators do not commute , are enough to establish the qualitative connection between the maxima of the curvature and the stability of small domains near the maxima .    finally , our treatment of the relation between the geometry of the diffusion and the stability of the stochastic dynamics is rather heuristic .",
    "we treated the diffusion metric as a given field on @xmath16 ( determined by the linblad operators ) , and we numerically studied the paths of the stochastic process @xmath5 in relation to the sign of the curvature maxima .",
    "however , the problem of stability versus the properties of the diffusion metric should be formulated and studied using the appropriate notions of stochastic stability @xcite,@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we think that the numerical evidence strongly indicates that there is a clear relation between the sign and the shape of the curvature maxima and the systems dynamical stability .",
    "according to the view of qsd theory , evolution of a state of an open quantum system is a diffusion process governed by a complex stochastic differential equation on the hilbert space of the system .",
    "the diffusion term of the qsd evolution equation explicitly depends on the operators modelling the environment and on the current state vector of the system .",
    "we have studied the riemannian metric associated with the diffusion term in the qsd equation .",
    "the metric is defined on the real 2n - dimensional space ( here n is the complex dimension of the hilbert space ) and is directly related to the properties of the linblad operators of the environment .",
    "we have shown that the scalar curvature of the metric has local maxima at states that are favored by the corresponding environment .",
    "the curvature at different points , and in particular its local maxima , can be be negative or positive depending on the strength of the coupling to the environment .",
    "also , the sharpness of the curvature maxima reflects the type of the environment .",
    "we have shown that there is a sense in which the sign of the curvature maxima is related to the stability of the corresponding state under the addition of a small perturbation that does not commute with the considered linblad operator . if the environment type and the coupling strength are such that the curvature has sharp positive maxima , than the corresponding state is likely to attract the states of the system whose evolution is governed by the environment and a hamiltonian that do not necessarily commute .",
    "on the other hand , if the curvature maxima are negative , the corresponding states are dynamically unstable under a small hamiltonian perturbation that does not commute with the linblad operators . in conclusion ,",
    "the curvature of the diffusion metric is a relatively easy to calculate , and a very good indicator of what the environment dominated dynamics of the system would look like .",
    "the qsd equation describes the evolution of a pure quantum state using the hilbert space of the quantum system , but , because it is norm - preserving , it gives also an equation on the state space , namely on the space of rays of the hilbert space .",
    "the riemannian metric associated with the diffusion on @xmath16 gives a hermitian modification of the fubini - study metric on @xmath111 .",
    "it is common to consider the complex projective manifold with the associated fubini - study metric as the proper framework for the geometry of quantum states @xcite,@xcite , so the modification of the metric due to the diffusion should also be formulated within this framework .",
    "the examples that we have analyzed in this paper are restricted on a single qubit under the influence of various types of environments .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze the properties of the diffusion metric in the case of coupled gubits , and in particular to see what is the curvature at the entangled states .",
    "probably the proper framework for such analyzes is the formulation on @xmath111 , mentioned in the previous paragraph , because the entangled states then have characteristic geometric interpretation @xcite .",
