    "simulations of molecular clouds suggest that stars form in deeply embedded filamentary structures that subsequently collapse and merge to form star clusters and a diffusely distributed component ( e.g. bonnell et al .",
    "2011 ) . assuming that the majority of stars form in such environments then a census of young stars in clusters and in the so - called ` field ' suggests that most clusters must be short - lived (",
    "e.g. lada & lada 2003 ; silva - villa & larsen 2011 ; fall & chandar 2012 ) .",
    "that stars do not form in isolation is important not only for interpreting the nature and evolution of star clusters but also for understanding the properties of stars in the field .",
    "this is because the time that stars stay in close physical proximity in their natal environments may affect the properties of the objects that ultimately migrate into the field , such as the binary fraction ( e.g. parker & meyer 2014 ) and the low mass cut - off of the main sequence ( ms ; e.g. johnstone et al .",
    "1998 ; adams et al . 2004 ) .",
    "feedback from massive stars likely plays a key role in cluster evolution .",
    "feedback may purge the gas that is the dominant contributor to the total system mass early in a cluster s evolution , thereby altering the gravitational potential so that stars are no longer bound to the cluster .",
    "feedback is also a potential regulator of star formation during embedded phases ( e.g. nakamura & li 2014 ) , and may trigger star formation in surrounding areas ( e.g. bik et al . 2014",
    "; getman et al . 2014 ) .",
    "feedback may also provide re - cycled material to a star - forming region if star formation proceeds over timescales that are longer than a few myr ( e.g. palous et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "if feedback from massive stars is a significant influence on cluster evolution then the age distribution of embedded clusters should plunge at a time that corresponds to the lifetime of massive stars .",
    "studies of clusters with minimum masses of at least a few @xmath7 m@xmath8 in the nearby spiral galaxy m83 indicate that the oldest embedded clusters have ages @xmath9 myr ( hollyhead et al .",
    "2015 ) , which is roughly consistent with the lifetime of very massive stars .",
    "this age also corresponds to the onset of the red supergiant ( rsg ) evolutionary phase in stellar systems , and so marks a time when the intensity of the local uv radiation field will drop if very massive stars were initially present .",
    "factors other than feedback almost certainly also affect cluster evolution .",
    "the kinematic state of a cluster at the time of gas expulsion likely plays a significant role in its survivability , in the sense that systems that happen to be in a super - virial state at the epoch of gas expulsion will have a greater chance of surviving than those in a sub - virial state ( e.g. farias et al .",
    "the fate of a cluster may also depend on environmental factors such as proximity to massive molecular clouds ( e.g. kruijssen et al .",
    "2012 ) , location in a galaxy ( e.g. silva - villa et al .",
    "2014 ) , and the morphological characteristics of the host galaxy ( e.g. de grijs et al . 2013 ) .",
    "having a large initial mass may not be a guarantee that a cluster will survive for more than a few myr .",
    "rather , the fate of a young cluster may be influenced by local conditions within the natal environment .",
    "stars in massive star - forming regions may form in a range of environments with surface densities that span at least 4 orders of magnitude ( e.g. kuhn et al . 2015 ) , and it is the densest sub - structures that might be expected to have the highest chances of long - term survival .",
    "not all systems contain such sub - structures .",
    "for example , the massive star - forming complex w33 lacks compact sub - structures , and will likely evolve into a loose association ( e.g. messineo et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the star - to - star age dispersion in a cluster is one measure of how long star - forming material is retained , and this can be estimated by measuring the age difference between the youngest pre - ms ( pms ) stars and the oldest ms stars .",
    "realistic stellar structure models that span a wide range of masses and evolutionary states are required , and the failure to include key physical processes can skew age dispersion estimates .",
    "for example , models presented by somers & pinsonneault ( 2015 ) indicate that the failure to account for star spots may cause isochrones to detect an erroneous age dispersion in the cmds of systems that are actually coeval .",
    "observations suggest that age dispersions up to a few myr are common in massive young clusters ( e.g. romn - ziga et al .",
    "2015 ; zeidler et al . 2015",
    "; kuryavtseva et al . 2012 ) .",
    "such a relatively short star - forming history is consistent with observations that point to a rapid collapse for massive systems ( e.g. banerjee & kroupa 2015 ) and the timescale over which feedback may start to influence cluster evolution .",
    "still , evidence for larger age dispersions has been found in some cases ( e.g. de marchi et al .",
    "2011b ; lim et al .",
    "2013 ) . environment may also play a role in determining the duration of star formation .",
    "in particular , the spread in age in low mass clusters that form in low density environments may be significantly larger than in more massive  and presumably more compact ",
    "clusters ( pfalzner et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the galactic disc contains young clusters in a range of environments , and the investigation of clusters and their immediate surroundings throughout the galaxy will provide insights into the processes that affect cluster evolution . with r@xmath10 kpc ( paunzen et al .",
    "2005 ) , the open cluster ngc 3105 is in the outer regions of the galactic disc .",
    "previous estimates of the age and distance of ngc 3105 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the age estimates in table 1 draw on different age diagnostics and wavelengths .",
    "the ages measured by sagar et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and paunzen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are based on the photometric properties of ms turn - off ( msto ) and post - ms stars at visible wavelengths . in contrast , the age estimated by davidge ( 2014 ) is based on the ms cut - off ( msco ) and the properties of the cluster pms sequence in the @xmath11 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .    ccl age & distance & reference + ( myr ) & ( kpc ) & + @xmath12 & @xmath13 & sagar et al .",

    "images obtained with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) on gemini south are used to construct a cmd that extends from the very brightest cluster members to @xmath1 , which is where pms stars might be expected based on some previous age estimates . if the input physics used in stellar structure models are correct then age diagnostics that cover different wavelengths and a broad range of magnitudes should yield the same age .",
    "the range of magnitudes covered with the gmos data enables an investigation of cluster age using indicators that span a range of masses and evolutionary states .",
    "in addition to investigating the age , distance , and reddening of ngc 3105 , the gmos cmd was also used to select targets for spectroscopic observation at visible and red wavelengths .",
    "spectra were obtained of stars that span a range of brightnesses , and the data are used to investigate the line - of - sight interstellar absorption , search for line emission , and estimate spectral types .",
    "this is the first spectroscopic survey of ngc 3105 that includes stars that are fainter than the msto .",
    "finally , images of ngc 3105 that were obtained as part of the spitzer ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) glimpse ( benjamin et al . 2003 ) survey are also examined .",
    "these data are used to probe the light profile of the cluster and investigate the mid - ir properties of bright stars in and around ngc 3105 .",

    "the stellar spectra are discussed in section 7 , while a discussion and summary of the results follows in section 8 .",
    "images and visible / red spectra were recorded with gmos ( hook et al .",
    "2004 ) on gemini south as part of program gs-2014a - q-84 ( pi : davidge ) .",
    "the gmos detector when these data were recorded was a mosaic of three @xmath18 eev ccds .",
    "each 13.5@xmath19 m square ccd pixel subtended 0.073 arcsec per side on the sky .",

    "exposures that monitor the floating bias level and the static bias pattern of the ccds ( ` biases ' ) were recorded at the end of the night .",
    "images that measure variations in sensitivity due to instrument optics and pixel - to - pixel differences in detector sensitivity ( ` flats ' ) , and interference fringes in @xmath22 ( ` fringe frames ' ) were provided by gemini as part of the data package for this program . the flats were constructed from observations of the twilight sky .    a standard processing sequence for ccd mosaic imaging at visible and red wavelengths was applied to remove instrumental signatures . to start",
    ", the outputs from the individual ccds in the science and calibration images were multiplied by their amplifier gains .",
    "the bias frames were subtracted from the gain - corrected images , and the results were then divided by the flats .",
    "the fringe frame was scaled to match the long and short exposure times of the @xmath22 science images , and the result was subtracted from these data .",
    "the long exposure @xmath22 images were registered using the centroids of stars located across the imaged field as reference points , and the results were averaged together to construct a final deep @xmath22 image .",
    "the @xmath21 and short - exposure @xmath22 images were aligned with the combined deep @xmath22 image .",
    "this required the application of modest offsets ( @xmath27 arcsec ) to adjust for slight shifts in telescope pointing that occur during guiding .",
    "the final deep @xmath22 image is shown in the left hand panel of figure 1 .",
    "multi - slit spectra of stars in and around ngc 3105 were recorded on the night of april 18 , 2014 .",
    "target selection was based on ( 1 ) location on the sky close to the center of ngc 3105 , and ( 2 ) location on the @xmath0 cmd that was constructed from the gmos images .",
    "targets were restricted to the middle ccd of the detector mosaic to maximize common star - to - star wavelength coverage . in some cases it was possible to place another source in a slit that sampled a high priority target by making minor adjustments to the slit location , and",
    "these additional sources constitute a modest serendipitous sample . in all ,",
    "spectra were recorded of 35 sources , although the spectrum of one source ( # 22 ) was found to be an artifact of a nearby bright star , and so is not considered further .",
    "the locations and photometric properties of the stars for which spectra were obtained are listed in table 3 .    with the exception of the three stars used to align the focal plane mask ( see below ) , the slits had a length of 6 arcsec and a width of 1 arcsec .",
    "the light was dispersed with the r400 grating ( 400 l / mm ; @xmath28 ) , and the spectral resolution measured from cuar emission lines is @xmath29 fwhm .",
    "this resolution is too low to allow radial velocities that are reliable enough to assess cluster membership to be measured .",
    "the seeing , estimated from the width of stellar profiles in the slits , was @xmath30 arcsec fwhm .",
    "three stars were used to align the slit mask on the sky , and @xmath31 arcsec apertures  rather than slits  were cut in the mask for these sources .",
    "these stars are among the brightest in the sample , and their light profiles could be examined in short exposure images to check that they are centered in their apertures . while spectra were recorded of the alignment stars , their spectroscopic line profiles differ slightly from those recorded through slits given that their spectral resolution is tied to the seeing disk , rather than a 1 arcsec slit .",
    "however , there is no noticeable difference between the line profiles of the alignment stars and other science targets , and so they are considered in concert with the slit spectra .",
    "four 900 second exposures were recorded , with two having a nominal central wavelength of 6800  and the other two a central wavelength of 6850 .",
    "this offset in central wavelength allows the portions of the spectrum that fall on gaps between the ccds in one wavelength setting to be covered with the other setting .",
    "a gg455 filter was used to suppress higher spectroscopic orders , and the combined response of this grating @xmath32 filter combination results in poor performance at wavelengths @xmath33 .    given the broad wavelength coverage , the start and end wavelengths for each spectrum depends on the location of the star in the science field , and the sources listed in table 3 have a common wavelength coverage between @xmath34 and 8400 .",
    "this wavelength interval contains atomic and molecular transitions that are sensitive to metallicity , temperature , and surface gravity .",
    "features that are interstellar in origin are also expected in these spectra given that ngc 3105 is viewed through the galactic disk plane , with a line - of - sight extinction a@xmath35 magnitudes .",
    "diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) are clearly evident in the spectra of the brightest objects ( section 7.1 ) .",
    "flat field frames were recorded through the slit mask at each wavelength setting midway through the observing sequence .",
    "cuar arcs were recorded through the slit mask at each central wavelength at the end of the night .",
    "the flat - field and arc light sources are in the gemini facility calibration unit .",
    "the reduction of the spectra proceeded as follows .",
    "the individual exposures recorded for the science , flat - field , and arc frames were initially processed separately , starting with the multiplication by the gain of the output from each ccd .",
    "a series of bias frames , recorded at the end of the night , were median - combined , and the result was subtracted from each exposure . this was followed by the removal of cosmic rays , which were identified by applying a running median filter to highlight features that are sharper than those that result from spectroscopic lines and the seeing disk .",
    "the different exposures for each observation type ( science , flat - field , and arc ) were aligned to correct for the wavelength offsets applied during the observing sequence and then averaged together .",
    "the null signal in the gaps between ccds was rejected when computing the mean .",
    "individual slitlets were extracted from the combined exposures , and each slitlet of a cluster source was divided by the corresponding normalized flat - field spectrum .",
    "the flat - fielded cluster spectra were wavelength calibrated using line identifications made from the arcs .",
    "the background sky level was measured on a row - by - row basis near the edges of each wavelength calibrated slitlet , and the resulting sky spectrum was subtracted from each of the columns in that slitlet . the sky level for slits containing two stars was measured in the spatial interval where light from the stars was smallest .",
    "spectra of individual stars were extracted from the sky - subtracted slitlets by combining signal within the fwhm of each stellar light profile .",
    "telluric absorption features are present at wavelengths longward of 6600 .",
    "spectra of the white dwarf ltt 4364 that were recorded for program gs-2014a - q-12 on may 7 , 2014 with the same slit width , grating , airmass , and central wavelength as the ngc 3105 observations were used to suppress these telluric features .",
    "the ltt 4364 spectra were processed with the same procedures as the ngc 3105 spectra .",
    "division of the ngc 3105 spectra by the normalized ltt 4364 spectrum corrected well for telluric features , even though ngc 3105 and ltt 4364 were observed on different nights .",
    "division by the ltt 4364 spectrum also removes variations in system response over short and intermediate wavelength intervals , leaving pseudo continuum - corrected spectra that are normalized to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ltt 4364 .",
    "the final step in the processing was to fit a continuum function to each spectrum , and divide each telluric - corrected spectrum by the result .",

    "the persistent tendency for the 32 myr sequence to fall blueward of the peak in the color distribution at all magnitudes is due to the matching of the isochrones to the blue edge of the cluster sequence in the cmd .",

    "this agrees with the values found from the cmds in section 4 .",
    "while it is not clear if the stars in the intermediate sample belong to ngc 3105 , they appear to be at a similar distance .",
    "if the stars in the faint sample are on the ms of ngc 3105 then the isochrones suggest that they should have a g spectral - type .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the spectral - types of individual stars in the faint sample as the spectra have a low s / n ratio .",
    "however , na d is a deep absorption feature in the spectrum of late - type dwarfs , and it is seen in many of the faint sample spectra . na d provides a means of identifying foreground dwarfs , as these objects will have lower masses than stars in ngc 3105 , and so their spectra will have deeper na d absorption .    even though the majority of objects in the faint sample were intentionally selected to be in the cluster or shoulder regions to boost the probability of cluster membership , source counts suggest that roughly half of the stars in the faint sample will not be cluster members ( figure 6 ) .",
    "in fact , four stars in the faint sample ( # s 10 , 19 , 25 , and 26 ) were found to have na d absorption that was much deeper than that in the other objects , and these were flagged as candidate field stars . a median spectrum of the stars in the faint sample , but excluding # s 10 , 19 , 25 , and 26 , was constructed .",
    "the median was taken in an effort to suppress the influence of any field stars that might remain in the sample .",
    "the resulting spectrum , smoothed to a resolution of 400 to boost the s / n ratio , is shown in figure 16 .",
    "spectra of g and k stars from the le borgne et al .",
    "( 2003 ) compilation , smoothed to the same resolution , are also shown in that figure .",
    "h@xmath5 emission might be expected if there was large - scale chromospheric activity among the stars in the faint group , and this is not seen in the median spectrum .",
    "rather , there appears to be weak h@xmath5 absorption in the combined spectrum . as for na",
    "d , this feature has an ew of @xmath131  in the median faint sample spectrum .",
    "after accounting for interstellar absorption , na d in the median spectrum is much deeper than expected in g dwarfs , and is consistent with an early to mid - k spectral - type .",
    "there are interstellar absorption features in the median spectrum that complicate spectral classification based on comparisons with stars that are subject to only modest levels of extinction . as a late - type foreground dwarf that is also heavily extincted",
    ", star 32 is thus an interesting comparison object for the faint sample median spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of star 32 , smoothed to a resolution of 400 , is shown in figure 16 .",
    "there are many similarities between the median faint sample spectrum and that of star 32 .",
    "the lack of h@xmath5 absorption in the star 32 spectrum suggests that it has a later spectral - type than the majority of the faint sample members .",
    "based on the comparisons in figure 16 it appears that star 32 has a spectral - type in the range k5v  k7v .",
    "the deep na d and weak h@xmath5 absorption in the median faint sample spectrum is perhaps surprising given that a g spectral type was expected for these stars .",
    "star spot activity has the potential to affect the effective temperature of stars if the spots fall over a large part of the stellar disk .",
    "spotted single stars will have lower effective temperatures than unspotted models , and models examined by somers & pinsonneault ( 2015 ) suggest that the impact on effective temperature is @xmath132 k. this is not sufficient to produce the difference between the observed and expected spectral types .",
    "large - scale spot activity might also produce chromospheric emission , and no evidence for this is seen .",
    "a more pragmatic explanation is that  the culling of obvious field stars based on na d depth notwithstanding  foreground stars dominate the sample .",
    "spectra of stars with colors and magnitudes like those in the faint sample with a higher s /",
    "n ratio will be useful to distinguish between cluster and field stars at this brightness in ngc 3105 .",
    "images and spectra obtained with gmos on gs have been used to investigate the age , distance , and reddening of the outer galactic disk open cluster ngc 3105 .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 gmos images allow photometry to be obtained of sources that are much fainter than in previous studies at visible / red wavelengths , reaching magnitudes where cluster pms stars might be expected if ngc 3105 has an age @xmath88 myr , as suggested by some age estimates .",
    "the spectra enable the first detailed reconnaisance of the stellar content of ngc 3105 and the surrounding field below the msto , and yield independent reddening and distance estimates .",
    "there is good agreement between the reddening and distance found from the photometry and spectra .",
    "the reddening estimated from the locus of ms stars on the cmd agrees with that found from the depth of na d absorption in the spectra of bright early - type stars in and around ngc 3105 using a calibration found by poznanski et al .",
    "the distance estimated from ms - fitting is consistent with that found in previous studies , and also agrees with the distance estimated from the spectral - types of candidate ms stars at intermediate magnitudes .",
    "we note that these stars are located throughout the gmos science field , and so are not restricted to the dense inner regions of the cluster where membership probabilities are high .",
    "an age of at least 32 myr is estimated for ngc 3105 based on the photometric properties of ( 1 ) the brightest stars near the cluster center , which include msto and post - ms objects , and ( 2 ) the morphology of the lower parts of the cmd .",
    "an upper limit to the age range is 71 myr , and this is defined by the photometric properties of candidate upper ms stars .",
    "the isochrones suggest that the gmos observations do not sample pms stars in ngc 3105 , and so deeper observations will be required to find these objects at visible / red wavelengths .",
    "this may prove to be challenging as it can be difficult to identify stars with sub - solar masses in low latitude clusters as foreground / background stars may have similar photometric properties . in the case of very young clusters",
    "individual pms stars that are surrounded by accretion discs may be identified based on their distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties . however , the circumstellar discs that produce these signatures have a characteristic decay time of a few myr ( fedele et al . 2010 , but see also e.g. de marchi et al .",
    "2011a ) , negating their usefulness as beacons for identifying sources in clusters as old as ngc 3105 .",
    "still , scicluna et al . (",
    "2014 ) suggest that in some cases circumstellar discs may be rejuvenated by the accretion of fresh molecular material , potentially increasing the time interval over which disks may be detected . in any event , ensembles of candidate stars can be identified statistically by examining the spatial distribution and photometric properties of objects ( e.g. davidge 2015 ) , as is done here .",
    "the consistency of age estimates based on observations that span a range of wavelengths are an important test of stellar structure models .",
    "davidge ( 2014 ) used near - infrared observations to examine the cmd and lf of ngc 3105 in the sub - solar mass regime .",
    "the @xmath11 cmd of the central @xmath133 arcsec of ngc 3105 constructed by davidge ( 2014 ) shows a well - defined sequence at faint magnitudes that was attributed to the pms .",
    "the pms sequence in the @xmath11 cmd is bracketed by 20 and 40 myr isochrones from bressan et al .",
    "the age of ngc 3105 estimated from the pms locus in that cmd is 25  30 myr .",
    "_ considering only the faintest stars in the gmos cmd _",
    ", the comparisons in figure 6 suggest that ngc 3105 has an age @xmath134 myr .",
    "the ages derived from pms / faint ms stars in the near - ir and at visible / red wavelengths are thus consistent .",
    "davidge ( 2014 ) also examined the @xmath135 lf of the center of ngc 3105 to a faint limit @xmath136 , which corresponds to @xmath137m@xmath8 .",
    "the flat shape of the @xmath135 lf at the faint end is similar to the @xmath22 lf , which is flat from @xmath138 ( @xmath139m@xmath8 ) to @xmath140 ( @xmath114m@xmath8 ) , and is matched by models that have a chabrier ( 2003 ) mf .",
    "however , davidge ( 2014 ) found that model lfs that are based on the bressan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) isochrones and that assume a solar neighborhood mf do not reproduce the flat nature of the @xmath135 lf at faint magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath135 observations probe less massive stars than the gmos @xmath22 data .",
    "if the interpretation of the @xmath135 lf is correct then a downturn in the @xmath22 lf will occur 1  2 magnitudes below the faint limit of the gmos data .",
    "there is excess mir emission associated with some of the brightest stars in the gmos science field , as expected if these objects have circumstellar disks .",
    "the spectra of four of the stars in the bright and intermediate brightness samples have h@xmath5 in emission , which is not surprising as line emission is common among early - type stars in systems with ages @xmath141 myr .",
    "if these stars are not cluster members then they may have formed more - or - less concurrently with ngc 3105 in structures that have dispersed into the field .",
    "simulations of star formation in molecular clouds discussed by bonnell et al .",
    "( 2011 ) suggest that both clustered and diffuse components form .",
    "while many young star - forming regions will expand and dissipate , some retain primordial sub - structures ( e.g. gregorio - hetem et al .",
    "2015 ) , and ngc 3105 may be such a remnant .",
    "diffusely distributed young populations might be expected to survive longer in the low density regions of the outer galactic disk than in higher density areas at smaller galactocentric radii .",
    "the presence of a diffuse bright population notwithstanding , star counts indicate that the brightest , most massive members of ngc 3105 are more centrally concentrated than the fainter , low mass members , indicating that there is mass segregation .",
    "the central concentration of bright members might have a primordial origin .",
    "simulations ( e.g. dale et al . 2015 ) suggest that  in the absence of feedback  star formation rates in forming clusters tend to be highest in regions where the potential well is deepest . in fact , evidence for primordial segregation is seen in the orion star - forming region ( e.g. hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) , and simulations suggest that it can also occur in very low mass clusters ( kirk et al .",
    "while feedback can suppress star formation in dense regions ( e.g. dale et al .",
    "2015 ) , clusters that have a low stellar mass will have lower probablities of forming the massive stars that drive feedback than more massive systems , and so long - lived central knots may form preferentially in low mass clusters . there is an observational bias favoring the detection of low mass clusters that have bright , central concentrations , and so the observed frequency of such systems may overestimate their actual numbers ."
