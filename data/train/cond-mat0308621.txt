    "scaling is the integration of high - k oxides as gate oxides into silicon technology .",
    "the gate oxide is the dielectric of a capacitor , which is used to attract charge carriers into the channel region .",
    "thus a current can flow from source to drain , provided a voltage is applied to the gate electrode . with a thickness of only 1 - 2 nm@xcite the gate dielectric is the smallest structure of a transistor . as the thickness of the gate oxide",
    "is further reduced , its insulating property is lost due to direct tunneling through the ultrathin oxide .",
    "the results are intolerable leakage currents and a large power consumption .",
    "a remedy to this problem is the replacement of the current sio@xmath1 based gate oxides with an insulator having a larger dielectric constant , a so - called high - k oxide",
    ". a high - k oxide gate with the same capacity as an ultrathin sio@xmath1 based one will be thicker and should therefore exhibit smaller leakage currents due to direct tunneling .",
    "the integration of new oxides into the semiconductor technology has , however , proven to be a major problem .",
    "hence an enormous research effort is underway to understand growth of high - k oxides onto silicon .",
    "currently , hfo@xmath1 and zro@xmath1 are the main contenders for the first generation of high - k oxides to be introduced in fabrication .",
    "these oxides still exhibit an interfacial sio@xmath1 layer and therefore do not form a direct interface with silicon . as scaling proceeds , an interfacial sio@xmath1 layer can not be tolerated anymore .",
    "the existence of an atomically abrupt interface between silicon and a high - k oxide has been demonstrated by mckee et al.@xcite for ba@xmath2sr@xmath3tio@xmath0 on si(001 ) , after an epitaxial relationship has been reported in the late 80s.@xcite    a detailed understanding of metal adsorption is crucial to control oxide growth on si .",
    "the growth process is guided by the sequence of structures that develop as the metal is deposited on the silicon surface.@xcite the nature of these structures as well as the interface between si and a high - k oxide is , however , still under debate .    the adsorption of the alkaline earth metals sr and ba on si(001 ) has been extensively studied .",
    "most of the studies of sr on si(001 ) are diffraction studies such as low - energy electron diffraction ( leed )  @xcite and reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed )  @xcite or scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm )  @xcite experiments .",

[ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the chain formation is driven by the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged sr - ions , located at * a*-sites , and the negatively charged dimers : an isolated sr ion located at an * a*-site , with the lone pairs of the four neighboring dimers pointing towards it , donates its two valence electrons into a silicon dangling bond adjacent to a neighboring valley .",

    "the filled dimers are clearly identified by the absence of any buckling .",
    "two nearest sr ions of one chain are displaced parallel to the dimer row by one lattice constant in order to position the filled dimer inbetween .",
    "since the favorable sr positions are staggered with respect to the dimers , the chains run at an angle of 30  degree relative to the direction of a dimer or 60 degree with respect to the dimer rows .",
    "the small energy difference of 0.02  ev per sr ion between diagonal and zig - zag chains at e.g. 1/8th ml can not be considered as a hard number due to the systematic errors of dft calculations .",
    "it does , however , indicate that the energy cost for changing the direction of such a chain is negligible so that these chains may meander on the surface .    as for the isolated sr ad - atom ,",
    "an additional stabilization occurs due to the dimer buckling of the surrounding silicon dimers .",

    "the buckling of one of the dimers next to a sr ion raises the energy by 0.38  ev.@xcite this ordering induces a freezing of the dimer buckling , which reaches far out into the clean silicon surface , as can be clearly seen in the stm images by hu et al.@xcite    at first sight one might think that there is a second preferred binding site in fig .",

    "this configuration is , however , only possible for a pair of sr atoms .",
    "a further continuation of such a chain perpendicular to the dimer row will make it impossible to rearrange dimers in a way that only filled dangling bonds are oriented towards the ad - atoms .",
    "such chains are therefore destabilized with respect to diagonal or zig - zag ones .",
    "a favorable registry between two sr - chains is obtained if the sr atoms are either in contact or separated by an even number of vacant * a * sites along each valley of the si - surface .",
    "this follows from a simple building principle which is an extension of what is already known from isolated chains :    * each sr atom is electrostatically stabilized by four negatively charged silicon atoms located next to it .",
    "negative silicon atoms have two electrons in their dangling bond and are in a raised , @xmath22-like bonding configuration .",
    "+ violation of this rule raises the energy by 0.38  ev per empty dangling bond next to the sr atom . at this level of abstraction",
    "we do not distinguish between a negatively charged si atom of a buckled and an unbuckled dimer .",
    "* there are no reversals of the dimer buckling in the sr - free regions on the surface .",
    "a buckling reversal increases the energy by 0.06  ev .",
    "this is a consequence of the anti - correlated coupling of the dimer buckling within one row ( see section  [ sec : cleansurf ] ) .",

    "the states on the sr atom , which appear in the valence band , can be attributed to the tails of the si dangling bonds , which hybridize with the sr-@xmath4 orbital .",

    "these states actually form a single band that is separated from the valence and conduction bands .",

    "the region in between two lines correspond to the different surface phases .",
    "the lines indicate the coexistence of the two neighboring phases .",
    "we find thermodynamically stable phases at 1/6  ml and 1/4  ml . we did not fully explore the phase diagram below 1/6  ml . in this region",
    "we find single chain structures as shown in fig  [ fig : schematic1614 ]  ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "entropic effects disorder the arrangement of chains at room temperature .    at 1/4 ml",
    "we find an ordered structure of double chains . beyond 1/4",
    "ml we predict nearly random arrangements of double vacancies .",
    "the double vacancy is stabilized relative to the single vacancy due to a favorable dimer buckling .",
    "the structure at 1/2 ml is a clear phase boundary for a wide range of chemical potentials .",
    "the next phase boundary is found at a coverage of 2/3 ml with a ( @xmath38 ) reconstructed surface . above 2/3 ml",
    "there are a number of low - energy structures with various coverages and a @xmath34 periodicity .    within the phase region of the 2/3  ml coverage ,",
    "bulk sr silicides become thermodynamically stable as indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : chempot ] .",
    "as mentioned above , we expect the onset of silicide formation to be significantly delayed due to thin - film effects as the bulk sr silicides are highly incommensurate with the si(001 ) substrate .",
    "it is of interest to compare our phase diagram with that obtained by mckee et al.@xcite at around 600  c they determine three line - compounds at 1/6  ml , 1/4  ml and 5/8  ml . our calculations reproduce phase boundaries at 1/6  ml and 1/4  ml . the next phase with a @xmath39 diffraction pattern is seen at @xmath63  ml , which is close to the coverage of 2/3 , where our calculations predict a phase with the identical periodicity .",
    "the difference in coverage corresponds to a change by one in 16 ad - atoms or 1/24  ml .",
    "this difference may be attributed to occasional sr vacancies , which help to release strain .",
    "it seems surprising that no phase boundary is seen at 1/2  ml .",
    "this may be due to the fact that on the one hand the @xmath32 structure develops continuously out of the multiple chains structures below 1/2  ml and on the other hand it can be transformed continuously into the @xmath39 structure by introducing thin stripes with local coverage of 1  ml .",
    "the multiplicity of structures with low energy above a coverage of 2/3-ml suggests the presence of disordered structures at elevated temperatures .",
    "mckee reports incommensurate structures beyond a coverage of 5/8  ml.@xcite    a similar multiplicity of structures is found for 1 ml .",
    "our calculation predicts a @xmath39 structure as the most favorable .",
    "however we find also @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 reconstructions within a window of 0.11  ev per sr atom .",
    "we did not extend our calculations beyond 4/3  ml , where an overlayer of metallic sr is formed .",
    "therefore , our data does not necessarily indicate the presence of a phase boundary at 4/3  ml .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the surface structures of sr adsorbed on si(001 ) as a function of coverage .",
    "we propose a theoretical phase diagram by relating the phase boundaries at zero temperature to chemical potentials , which can be converted into partial pressure and temperature in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we predict phases at 1/6  ml , 1/4  ml , 1/2  ml , 2/3  ml and 1  ml .",
    "structural models are discussed for all experimentally observed reconstructions except a @xmath64 reconstructed layer attributed to a coverage of 1/3  ml .",
    "the models are explained in terms of structural templates and rationalized in terms of their electronic structure .",
    "our findings elucidate the chemistry of alkaline earth metals on si(001 ) and the phases of sr on si(001 ) , which is expected to provide critical information for the growth of one of the most promising high - k gate oxide to date , namely srtio@xmath0 .",
