    "this connection is indeed one of evergreen themes of geometry and topology .",
    "it was an interesting recent observation of karasev @xcite that a similar cohomological cup - length approach can be utilized for the proof of some results of more combinatorial nature , including the following two classical results of lebesgue , and knaster , kuratowski , mazurkiewicz ( kkm ) .",

    "the method of karasev was based on the use of cohomological properties of ( both non - singular and singular ) toric varieties .",
    "in particular he was able to unify theorems  [ thm : lebesgue ] and [ thm : kkm ] and interpret them as special cases of a single statement valid for all simple polytopes .    _",

    "then for some @xmath8 the set @xmath9 intersects at least @xmath10 facets of @xmath11 .",
    "we continue this study by methods of toric topology , emphasizing the role of quasitoric manifolds and davis - januszkiewicz spaces @xcite .",
    "we focus on special classes of simple polytopes including the class of @xmath0-colorable simple polytopes which were introduced by joswig in @xcite .",
    "the associated classes of quasitoric manifolds have computable and often favorable cohomological properties , which have already found applications outside toric topology @xcite .",
    "our central results , the ` colorful lebesgue theorem ' ( theorem  [ thm : color - lebesgue ] ) and the  colorful kkm - theorem ( theorem  [ thm : color - kkm ] ) , together with their companions theorem  [ thm : quantitative - lebesgue ] and theorem  [ thm : color - kkm - bis ] , are designed to include theorems  [ thm : lebesgue ] and [ thm : kkm ] as special cases and to illuminate the role of special classes of quasitoric manifolds over @xmath0-colorable and @xmath12-colorable simple polytopes .    in the same vein",
    "we prove the ` colorful hex theorem ' theorem  [ thm : color - hex ] and describe a ` colorful voronoi - hex game ' played by @xmath0 players on an @xmath0-dimensional voronoi checkerboard .",
    "we referrer the reader , curious or intrigued by the use of the word ` colorful ' in these statements , to @xcite and @xcite for a sample of results illustrating how the term ` colorful ' gradually acquired ( almost ) a technical meaning in many areas of geometric and topological combinatorics .",
    "a basic insight from the theory of _ lebesgue covering dimension _ is that an @xmath0-dimensional space can not be covered by a family @xmath13 of open sets which are _ ` small in size ' _ unless we allow non - empty intersections of @xmath12 sets or more . in other words if know in advance that the covering multiplicity of the family is @xmath14 , then some of the sets @xmath15 must be ` large ' in some sense .    theorems  [ thm : lebesgue ] and [ thm : kkm ] turn this vague sense of ` largeness ' into precise results where the combinatorics and facial structure of the cube and simplex respectively plays an important role .",
    "karasev @xcite has found a very natural and interesting way of proving and generating such results , based on the theory of ( complex and real ) toric varieties .",
    "the use of the cup - length estimates is of course well known in the theory of lyusternik - schnirelmann category and its ramifications .",
    "however , more combinatorial aspects of the problem and possibilities of the method do nt seem to have been carefully explored and they certainly deserve a further study .",
    "from this point of view it is quite natural to explore which classes of convex polytopes may provide an adequate concept of ` largeness ' suitable for generalizing classical theorems of lebesgue ( on coverings of cubes ) and the knaster - kuratowski - mazurkiewicz theorem ( on coverings of simplices ) .    with this goal in mind we use the theory of _ quasitoric manifolds _ as introduced by davis and januszkiewicz in the seminal paper @xcite and developed by many authors , see the monograph of buchstaber and panov @xcite ( and the forthcoming , considerably updated and revised new version @xcite ) ) .",
    "quasitoric manifolds offer more flexibility and versatility than toric varieties , since they are easier to construct and their geometric and algebraic topological properties are even more closely related to combinatorics of simple polytopes .",
    "another input came from the theory of projectives in simplicial complexes and colorings of simple polytopes , as initiated by joswig in @xcite .",
