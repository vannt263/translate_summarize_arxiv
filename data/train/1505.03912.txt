    "@xcite , although , as pointed out above , there are no interstitial sites on the chequerboard lattice .",
    "the essential point is , indeed , that the additional particles are delocalised .",
    "these particles have a high mobility and this is energetically favourable to localised states , as pointed out by huber et al .",

    "then , the hamiltonian reads @xmath84      the cdw is the exact ground state at the critical density @xcite .",
    "therefore , as in the case of small @xmath79 , we use the cdw at the critical density and add one further boson . a first variational ansatz for the ground state is thus @xmath85 the variation was done on a 20x20 cutout of the chequerboard lattice . for reasons of numerical stability ,",
    "we choose a symmetric sub - unit of 16 lattice sites containing five faces on which @xmath86 are varied freely and we let @xmath87 outside that region .",

    "it seems also energetically favourable to have the additional particle localised and not distributed over many faces .",
    "since the additional particle is localised on an already occupied face , a second variational ansatz for the ground state is @xmath89 for an arbitrary face of @xmath27 . since all faces are independent , this variational problem is equivalent to solving the problem for two hard - core bosons on a square .",

    "the smallest building block is a hexagon .",
    "one particle on the hexagon has an energy of @xmath36 .",
    "if we put two hard - core bosons on a hexagon , the energy is @xmath102 .",
    "the smallest non - trivial sub - unit of the kagom lattice consists of one hexagon , surrounded by six triangles and three non - touching hexagons , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourhexagons ] .",
    "three hard - core bosons on this sub - unit are placed on the three outer hexagons ; the corresponding state is the only ground state on this sub - unit with energy @xmath103 .",
    "this state has three interstitial sites .",
    "the ground state with four particles on this sub - unit must have an energy below @xmath104 and following our variational argument , there are at least three eigenstates below this energy .    sub - unit of the kagom lattice .",
    "the cycles denote the occupied faces . in the exact ground state with three particles ,",
    "each face is occupied by one boson . in the variational states ( [ eq : variationalhardcore ] ) with four bosons one of the faces is occupied by two bosons . ]",
    "a numerical diagonalisation of the sub - unit with four particles shows that there are three almost degenerate states with energies between @xmath105 and @xmath106 and one state , the ground state , with an energy of @xmath107 .",

    "the overlap of the ground state , with one of the states where two particles are on a hexagon , is only 0.085 .",
    "the other three exact eigenstates with energies below @xmath108 have a high overlap with linear combinations of the three states with two particles on a hexagon .",
    "the overlap lies above 0.95 .",
    "this shows , that linear combinations of the variational states , where the additional hard - core boson is put on one of the occupied hexagons , describe these three low energy states well .",
    "however , in the true ground state of the sub - unit the additional particle moves on the interstitial sites and is not localised on one of the occupied hexagons .",
    "this argument shows that interstitial sites on the kagom lattice are important if hard - core bosons are added to one of the ground states at the critical filling .",
    "this suggests that the argument by huber et al .",
    "@xcite may remain correct in the regime of strong interaction .",
    "the additional bosons move mainly on the interstitial sites and form a condensate at densities slightly above the critical density .",
    "the same arguments apply to line graphs of other bipartite plane lattices . if the faces of the underlying bipartite plane lattice form a two - colour map , the cdw states are at most two - fold degenerate . since each edge belongs to two faces , there are no interstitial sites .",
    "on the other hand , if three or more colours are needed to colour the faces of the underlying bipartite plane lattice , the cdw states have interstitial sites .",
    "this is true for infinite lattices and also for finite sub - units . in the latter case",
    "the outer faces has to be coloured as well . therefore",
    ", the sub - units should be chosen such that they need the same number of colours as the original lattice .",
    "an example for the case with more than two colours is the so called truncated square tiling or @xmath109-tiling , a bipartite plane lattice formed of octagons and squares .",
    "hard - core bosons on its line graph have a unique cdw ground state with one boson on each square .",
    "there are interstitial sites stemming from the additional edges of the octagons .",
    "the smallest non - trivial sub - unit consists of one octagon surrounded by four non - touching squares . putting five hard - core bosons on this sub - unit ,",
    "we expect at least four ground states with an energy less than @xmath110 , corresponding to the four states where the additional particle is put on one of the already occupied squares .",
    "a numerical diagonalisation of the sub - unit yields eight eigenstates with an energies less than @xmath110 . as for the kagom lattice",
    ", the ground state has a large expectation value of the particle number on the four interstitial sites .",
    "let us mention that in this case it might even be favourable to put two bosons on the interstitial site , because two hard - core bosons on the octagon have an energy of @xmath111 .",
    "this state contributes to the low lying eigenstates as well .",
    "the analysis on this sub - unit thus shows that the ground state is dominated by interstitial sites .",
    "an example where the faces of the underlying bipartite plane lattice form a two - colour map , like for the square lattice , can be constructed from the triangular lattice .",
    "we put an additional lattice site on each edge of the triangular lattice .",
    "the resulting lattice is a bipartite plane lattice .",
    "its line graph has hexagons connected via complete graphs with six vertices , similar to the kagom lattice , where the hexagons are connected via complete graphs with three vertices .",
    "two particles on a hexagon have the energy @xmath112 let us take a sub - unit with four hexagons , one in the middle surrounded by three non - touching hexagons . since there are three non - touching hexagons , we expect at least three eigenstates with energies below @xmath108 . the exact diagonalisation yields four such eigenstates .",
    "the three lowest states have , again , a large overlap between 0.66 and 0.88 with linear combinations of the states where the additional particle is put on a hexagon .",
    "the fourth eigenstate appears because of the large boundary of the sub - unit . indeed ,",
    "if we put two particles on the inner hexagon and two particles on the ring of 12 sites forming the boundary , we get a variational state with an energy of @xmath113 , only slightly above @xmath108 .",
    "this additional variational state has thus two bound pairs of bosons , in contrast to the three others with one bound pair , and a large overlap with two of the four low lying eigenstates .",
    "thus , in the ground state and in the three low lying eigenstates of this sub - unit , bound pairs of bosons are formed as for the chequerboard lattice .    there",
    "exist one - dimensional systems where these arguments apply as well .",
    "consider for instance the line graph of the square chain , a lattice of two chains of corner sharing triangles .",
    "the square chain needs indeed three colours because the two outer faces can not be coloured with the same colour as the squares .",
    "thus , the cdw states have interstitial sites .",
    "a numerical diagonalisation shows indeed that for hard - core bosons , additional particles move on these sites .",
    "let us mention that this one - dimensional lattice is sometimes called kagom - chain , see e.g. @xcite",
    "we showed that weakly interacting bosons on the chequerboard lattice behave similarly to weakly interacting bosons on the kagom lattice .",
    "we essentially confirmed the results obtained by huber et al .",
    "for the kagom lattice . above the critical density",
    "the additional particles are delocalised and form a condensate .    for hard - core bosons ,",
    "the situation is different : our results indicate that on the chequerboard lattice the additional particles form pairs of two bound bosons .",
    "this is similar to the findings of phillips et al . for the saw - tooth chain @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that , on the kagom lattice the additional particles move on interstitial sites as for weak interaction .",
    "the kagom lattice and the chequerboard lattice are just examples of two larger classes of two - dimensional lattices with flat bands .",
    "the kagom lattice is a prototype of line graphs of bipartite plane lattices where the faces can not be coloured with two colours . instead , three or four",
    "colours are needed . for all lattices in this class ,",
    "the cdw states have interstitial sites and we expect that additional particles will move on these sites , even for strong interactions . the chequerboard lattice is a prototype of line graphs of bipartite plane lattices where the faces form a two - colour map . in that case , since each edge of the original bipartite plane lattice belongs to exactly two faces , the cdw states have no interstitial sites and pairs of bound particles are formed for strong interactions .",
    "there are several questions which remain open .",
    "for instance , one may easily construct line graphs of three dimensional lattices like the line graph of the diamond lattice , an analog to the kagom lattice in three dimensions , or the line graph of the simple cubic lattice .",
    "partly , such lattices can be found in nature .",
    "the line graph of the diamond lattice is the octahedral sublattice of a spinel .",
    "being line graphs of bipartite graphs , these lattices have a lowest flat band and localised single particle eigenstates in that band .",
    "as in two dimensions , it is possible to construct strictly localised states . as in two dimensions",
    ", they are localised on the elementary cycles , squares or hexagons in the two examples .",
    "but unfortunately , a complete description of all multi - particle ground states at or below the critical density is not known .",
    "the arguments in @xcite do not apply here .",
    "therefore , a discussion of these lattices above the critical filling is out of reach today .",
    "let us mention that hard - core bosons on graphs is a topic that has recently been discussed in ( algebraic ) graph theory in connection with the isomorphism problem @xcite .",
    "spectral properties of hard - core bosons on a graph can reveal certain properties of the graph which are otherwise difficult to obtain .",
    "there is no direct relation between the current paper and these investigations , which mainly deal with strongly regular graphs .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to see that here as well a certain spectral property of hard - core bosons is connected to a graph theoretical problem , here the colouring of the faces ."
