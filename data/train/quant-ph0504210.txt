    "since the conception of the wigner function in 1932 @xcite , phase - space representations of quantum mechanics have found a wide range of applications . notably in complex quantum dynamics , they have become popular as they allow to compare classical and quantum dynamics on the same footing . the wigner function in particular",
    "has become the standard tool whenever the full information contained in the density matrix , including coherences , has to be represented .    in many cases",
    "the `` quantum phase space '' underlying the wigner function is fundamentally different from the corresponding classical one in that it is _",
    "discrete_. this occurs , for example , if both classical phase - space variables are cyclic , i.e. , if the classical phase space has the topology of a torus so that the periodicity of either variable implies quantization of the other .",
    "likewise , it is inevitable once , e.g. , in numerical implementations of wave - packet scattering , the spatial variable is reduced to a discrete lattice and at the same time restricted to some finite total length , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "finally , discrete phase spaces allow to define a perfectly self - consistent quantum mechanics living on a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xcite .",
    "a straightforward generalization of the original definition to the discrete case leads to a wigner function that contains the information of the density operator in several replicas .",
    "this redundancy is reflected in so - called ghost images of features standing out in the quantum state @xcite .",
    "modified definitions that avoid these redundancies have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we here start from the version in ref .",
    "@xcite , giving a transparent derivation in simple geometric terms that readily generalizes to _ arbitrary _ ( not necessarily odd or even prime ) integer hilbert - space dimensions .",
    "it allows to construct a propagator on the discrete phase space , which can be defined unambiguously only for a wigner function free of redundancy . as an illustrative example",
    ", we apply it to the quantum baker map @xcite .",
    "a more detailed account of our findings will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the original definition of the wigner function @xcite , @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 for a density operator @xmath3 consists of two steps , a transformation to sum - and - difference coordinates @xmath4 , @xmath5 of the density matrix @xmath6 , followed by a fourier transform along @xmath7 .",
    "the difficulty in applying this to a discrete spatial basis @xmath8 , @xmath9 arises from the fact that in @xmath10-space the original square lattice appears as `` base - centered cubic '' , with even and odd points in terms of @xmath11 . augmenting it to become `` simple cubic '' again by introducing fictitious extra lattice points where @xmath12 lead , upon fourier transformation ( of size @xmath13 ) , to a fourfold redundancy of the resultant wigner function @xcite , call it @xmath14 , abbreviating the discrete phase - space vector @xmath15 .",
    "we remove the redundancy as follows : by an additional fourier transform ( size @xmath13 ) , now in the @xmath16-direction , the redundancy takes the explicit form of an identical repetition , up to sign changes , of the coefficients in four @xmath17-blocks within the total @xmath18 `` brillouin zone '' .",
    "we cut out a single @xmath17-block , chosen centered around the origin so as to preserve twofold symmetries that reflect the reality of the wigner function , by multiplying with a two - dimensional discrete box function . upon undoing the additional second fourier",
    "transform ( now of size @xmath19 only ) , the wigner function is recovered , _ free of redundancies_.    cutting out the @xmath17-block from the fourier - transformed wigner function @xmath20 is equivalent to a convolution of @xmath21 with a fourier - transformed box function @xmath22 @xmath23    apart from revealing `` ghost images '' as artifacts and removing them , this procedure becomes indispensable once a propagator of the wigner function is to be defined in an unambiguous manner .",
    "the reason is that with a redundant wigner function , there is no unique way of relating the coefficients of the final wigner function to those of the initial one .",
    "denoting the transformation outlined above symbolically as @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , we find for the discrete wigner function propagator @xmath27 where @xmath28 propagates the density matrix from time @xmath29 to @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "if the time evolution is unitary , generated by a hamiltonian @xmath32 , the propagator can be expressed in terms of energy eigenstates @xmath33 , denoting @xmath34 .",
    "defining wigner eigenfunctions as @xmath35 , we have for the wigner propagator @xmath36 equation ( [ wigpropeifunc ] ) allows for an easy direct numerical access to the propagator once enough eigenfunctions , e.g. , in position representation , are known .",
    "the baker transformation @xcite is arguably the simplest example of a fully chaotic map of the unit square to itself .",
    "a quantum version has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of fourier transformations @xmath37 , @xmath38 of sizes @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath19 ( even ) denotes the hilbert - space dimension , as follows , @xmath41 so that wavefunctions map @xmath42 , and the density operator accordingly .",
    "we have calculated diagonal wigner eigenstates @xmath43 and off - diagonal ones @xmath44 and used them to construct the wigner propagator equivalent to the unitary map ( [ qubaker ] ) according to eq .",
    "( [ wigpropeifunc ] ) .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ qbmeigenst]a ) and @xmath46 ( [ qbmeigenst]b ) clearly show scars of classical unstable periodic orbits ( crosses ) which up to now could be identified only in the corresponding husimi functions @xcite , with considerably inferior resolution .",
    "figures [ qbmeigenst ] c , d show , respectively , the real and imaginary part of the off - diagonal eigenstate @xmath47 , scarred simultaneously by both orbits that appear in the eigenstates @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    the wigner propagator is depicted in fig .",
    "[ qbmprop ] , for fixed initial @xmath50 at @xmath51 , the leftmost point of one of the period-3 orbits scarring @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ qbmeigenst]b ) , at final times @xmath52 ( panel a ) and @xmath53 ( b ) . the strong localization of the propagator on the underlying classical orbit is evident , as are quantum coherence effects reflected in oscillatory patterns far off the classical orbit .",
    "the redundance - free wigner function for discrete phase spaces proposed here enables to identify classical and other phase - space structures in states and time evolution of quantum systems with finite - dimensional hilbert space , without being marred by artificial ghost images .",
    "it facilitates developping and assessing semiclassical approximations for the propagator in such systems @xcite , providing an alternative point of view for the analysis of coherent structures like `` quantum carpets '' @xcite .",
    "the method allows to represent signals simultaneously in time and in frequency space , in all applications where data are both discrete and periodic in time ( or space ) such as in optics , acoustics , or other fields possibly far away from quantum mechanics .",
