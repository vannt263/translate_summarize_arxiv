    "it is well known that an initially excited molecule can irreversibly transfer its energy to unexcited species located nearby  a fundamental process involved in ultrafast photochemistry , excitation transport in langmuir - blodgett films , determination of molecular structures , etc .. for ( acceptor ) molecules that exhibit a sufficiently broad ( quasi-)continuum of vibronic states , the energy transfer may be regarded as being irreversible , and the transfer rate can be calculated by using standard second - order perturbation theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . if instead of molecules , the donor and acceptor species are ( two - level ) atoms , the transfer can be reversed in principle , leading to a back - and - forth energy exchange between the atoms @xcite .",
    "this process can be thoroughly described by a nonperturbative treatment .",
    "when the interatomic interaction is weak , however , the probability of the return transfer can be so small that the energy exchange is essentially again a one - way process .",
    "in addition to that , the atoms always feature some natural linewidths , which can be regarded as continua of states .",
    "an aim of the present article is to establish the connection between the intermolecular energy transfer and the spontaneous - decay - assisted interatomic energy exchange .",
    "the underlying mechanism of intermolecular and interatomic energy transfer can be both rddi and rafi @xcite .",
    "in free space and for transfer distances @xmath0 below the wavelength of real - photon emission , the rddi described in terms of an instantaneous coulomb interaction potential with the familiar @xmath1 distance law is typically considered as the leading mechanism . for transfer distances exceeding the wavelength of real - photon emission",
    ", the rddi may be thought of as resulting from an extended off - resonant atom - field interaction , and the effect of the rafi needs to be considered carefully . in particular , in the multipolar - coupling quantum electrodynamics @xcite , the near - zone and far - zone results simply arise as limits of a unified theory based on the full atom - field coupling ( in electric - dipole approximation ) .",
    "similar to the single - atom spontaneous decay , the interatomic energy exchange can be strongly affected by the presence of material surroundings .",
    "while rddi and rafi in free space have been more or less well understood , there have been a number of open problems when material surroundings are present . in particular , it is not clear whether the near - zone @xmath1 law is still generally valid .",
    "another problem that needs investigation is the regime of strong rafi , i.e. , when suitably chosen material surroundings form a high-@xmath2 ( micro-)resonator , which gives rise to a strong atom - field coupling accompanied by quantum rabi oscillations .",
    "these and related problems have recently been very actual in view of proposals to entangle atoms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and to implement quantum logic gates ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , using atoms in a cavity , impurities in the condensed phase , or quantum dots in a semiconductor .    for two atoms that interact with cavity - type modes , a hamiltonian for treating both rddi and rafi was suggested in @xcite . in the hamiltonian , an effective dipole - dipole interaction energy , which may be thought of as resulting from a perturbative treatment of the off - resonant atom - field coupling , is added to the exact on - resonant atom - field interaction energy .",
    "unfortunately , the relevant coupling strengths are introduced as parameters rather than physically determined system quantities .",
    "moreover , the underlying mode expansion concept makes the theory inapplicable for the realistic case of absorbing and dispersing material surroundings .",
    "inclusion of material absorption and dispersion is especially important in designing quantum computing systems where dissipation and decoherence have to be strictly kept under control .    in what follows",
    "we give a more rigorous approach to the problem , basing on a recently developed quantization scheme for the electromagnetic field in the presence of ( linear ) absorbing and dispersing macroscopic bodies ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in this scheme ,",
    "an operator noise polarization source is introduced into the maxwell equations , and the electromagnetic field operators are given by a source - quantity representation in terms of the classical green tensor and a continuous set of bosonic vector fields , which play the role of the fundamental variables of the composite system of the electromagnetic field plus the media .",
    "the green tensor , which can be calculated in a purely classical manner , is essentially determined by the ( kramers - kronig consistent ) space- and frequency - dependent complex permittivity , which characterizes the relevant properties of the macroscopic bodies .",
    "the medium - assisted electromagnetic field can then be coupled to additional atomic systems , and the minimal - coupling hamiltonian can be constructed , from which the corresponding multipolar - coupling hamiltonian can be derived by means of a unitary transformation .    by using the multipolar - coupling hamiltonian in electric - dipole approximation , in section [ densmatrix ] an equation of motion for the reduced density operator of a system that consists of two - level atoms and that part of the medium - assisted electromagnetic field that resonantly interacts with the atoms is derived .",
    "it is shown that when the ( shifted ) atomic transition frequencies differ by amounts small compared to the scale of the frequency variation of the green tensor , the system can be regarded as being governed by a hamiltonian , with the rddi being described by a well - defined effective interaction energy .",
    "the problem of resonant energy exchange between two two - level atoms is studied in section [ sysdy ] , with special emphasis on the rate regime .",
    "the spectrum of the light emitted during the energy exchange is considered in section [ spectrum ] .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in section [ remarks ] .",
    "a system of @xmath3 two - level atoms [ positions @xmath4 , transition frequencies @xmath5 , transition dipole moments @xmath6 ] interacting with the electromagnetic field via electric - dipole transitions in the presence of dispersing and absorbing bodies can be described by the multipolar - coupling hamiltonian @xcite @xmath7&&\\hspace{8ex }      - \\sum_{a } \\int_0^\\infty { \\rm d}\\omega \\left [      \\hat{\\bf d}_a      \\underline{\\hat{\\bf e}}({\\bf r}_a,\\omega )      + { \\rm h.c.}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are bosonic fields which play the role of the fundamental variables of the electromagnetic field and the medium , including a reservoir necessarily associated with the losses in the medium , @xmath12 is the classical green tensor , and is the complex permittivity .",
    "there are no direct coulomb forces between the particles in the multipolar - coupling hamiltonian ( [ e2 ] ) ; all interactions are mediated by the medium - assisted electromagnetic field .    with regard to the interaction of the atoms with the electromagnetic field , it is convenient to decompose the latter into an on - resonant part ( denoted by @xmath13 ) and an off - resonant part ( denoted by@xmath14 ) .",
