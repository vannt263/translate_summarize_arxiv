    "within the last decade a growing interest in studying of noise of mesoscopic systems is observed  @xcite . as the dimension of the device goes on scaling down and only few conducting channels",
    "are saved giving a total conductance of order of conductance quantum @xmath0 the system becomes more sensitive to the noise .",
    "due to the random processes governing transport current is fluctuating in time even under dc bias .",
    "these fluctuations originate from granularity of carriers ( shot noise ) and from thermal disturbance ( thermal noise )  @xcite .",
    "the thermal noise reflects the fluctuations in the occupations of the leads due to thermal excitation , and vanishes at zero temperature .",
    "it is related to the linear conductance via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and thus does not carry extra information other than that obtained from ordinary conductance measurements . the shot noise is a purely non - equilibrium property and it results from the fact that current is not a continuous flow , but a sum of discrete pulses in time , each corresponding to the transfer of electron through the system .",
    "the latter fluctuations do not manifest in macroscopic systems since the inelastic scattering e.g. electron - phonon smoothes them , leaving only thermal noise .",
    "in contrast to thermal noise , shot noise can not be eliminated by lowering the temperature .",
    "the shot noise reveals information of transport properties which are not accessible by conductance measurements alone for example about the kinetics of electrons and about the correlations of electronic wave functions . for uncorrelated carriers ,",
    "shot noise is poissonian .",
    "deviations from the poissonian noise appear to be due to correlations between electrons .",
    "fermi - dirac statistics or the way carriers scatter and interact within a sample strongly affect shot .",
    "usually coulomb repulsion and fermi statistics both tend to smooth electron flow , thereby reducing shot noise below the uncorrelated poissonian limit , but under certain conditions the interplay of fermi statistics and interactions can lead to electron bunching i.e. to super - poissonian correlations  @xcite .",
    "the advances in nanofabrication techniques opened a new path in studying correlation effects .",
    "of special interest in this respect is kondo effect - a formation of the many body dynamical singlet between a localized spin and delocalized conduction electrons  @xcite , observed in semiconductor - based quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite and molecular nanostructures  @xcite .",
    "the tunability of nanostructures and their amenability to electrical measurements have allowed studies of kondo effect in a controlled way , in particular in nonequilibrium .",
    "spin kondo effect in nanostructures is well understood  @xcite and recently this knowledge has been enriched by analysis of current correlations  @xcite .",
    "it has been theoretically predicted  @xcite and experimentally verified  @xcite that in the unitary kondo regime the shot noise of su(2 ) qds is enhanced via back - scattering processes and a universal effective charge @xmath1 has been measured .",
    "an important issue for spintronics is how kondo physics is affected by magnetic field  @xcite or what is the impact of ferromagnetic electrodes  @xcite .",
    "the kondo effect can also occur , replacing the spin by orbital  @xcite or charge  @xcite degrees of freedom .",
    "spin and orbital degeneracies can also occur simultaneously leading to highly symmetric kondo fermi liquid ground state .",
    "su(4 ) group is the minimal group allowing orbital - spin entanglement , which guarantees rotational invariance in spin and orbital spaces .",
    "the four states entanglement is interesting for quantum computing , because each 4-state bit is equivalent to two 2-state bits , so the 4-state bits double the storage density .",
    "the unambiguous consequence of su(4 ) symmetry is a  halfed \" zero bias conductance reflecting a shift of kondo peak away from the fermi level to @xmath2 .",
    "this can be understood from friedel sum rule , which in this case gives corresponding phase shift at the fermi level @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting broadening of kondo peak , as compared to su(2 ) case means exponential enhancement of kondo temperature , which makes these structures interesting for practical applications .",
    "the observation of su(4 ) kondo effect has been reported in vertical quantum dots  @xcite and in carbon nanotubes ( cnts )  @xcite .",
    "the problem of simultaneous screening of charge or orbital degrees of freedom and spin has been widely discussed also from the theoretical point of view  @xcite , but there are only very few attempts to discuss noise in this range  @xcite .",
    "references  @xcite , which are based on the phenomenological fermi liquid description ( @xmath4 ) discussed some general aspects of the noise in the strong coupling fixed point regime of su(4 ) and predicted enhanced shot noise with universal charge @xmath5 .",
    "this suggestion has not been verified yet , because , due to the residual symmetry breaking perturbations this range is not easily accessible in experiment .",
    "the sole experiment on the noise in spin - orbital kondo range of cnt - qd has been carried by dellatre et al .",
    "@xcite in the range @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it has been shown for the first time in this paper that unitary kondo regime remains noisy in su(4 ) limit .",
    "these authors also pointed out on scaling properties of the noise and have shown that their experimental results were reasonably described by temperature - dependent slave boson mean field theory .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to examine an impact of the symmetry breaking perturbations on the noise of spin - orbital kondo systems .",
    "in particular we focus on the spin - dependent shot noise .",
    "this topic has received very little attention up to now . with exception of a very recent single result on the magnetic field dependence of noise in su(4 ) kondo regime  @xcite ,",
    "all other publications on the noise in coulomb blockade and kondo ranges concern su(2 ) symmetry ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "although our considerations are general we address our discussion to cnt - qds because these systems exhibit high kondo temperature and are well suited for the examination of the noise  @xcite .",
    "the low energy band structure of semiconducting carbon nanotubes is orbitally doubly degenerate at zero magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy corresponds to clockwise and counterclockwise symmetry of the wrapping modes in cnts  @xcite .",
    "field perpendicular to the nanotube axis breaks the spin degeneracy , whereas parallel field breaks both spin and orbital degeneracy .",
    "for perpendicular orientation apart from the central orbital kondo peak also satellites reflecting spin fluctuations occur in the density of states ( dos ) , whereas for parallel field both , spin and spin - orbital fluctuation satellites are observed .",
    "their occurrence is reflected by a depression of the shot noise for the fields or voltages corresponding to the energy of their position .",
    "currently there is a widespread interest in developing new types of spintronic devices and carbon nanotubes deserve special attention in this respect due to their long spin lifetimes  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss field induced spin filtering and giant tunnel magnetoresistance ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the role of polarization of electrodes is twofold , it makes the tunneling processes spin - dependent and it introduces an effective exchange field via spin - dependent charge fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the calculated fano factors , which quantify the deviation from the poissonian noise for both spin orientations are sub - poissonian , but for large polarization the minority spin fano has a value close to poissonian , whereas majority shot noise is almost completely suppressed and corresponding fano factor takes the values close to zero .",
    "an important question for spintronic application is the influence of any possible spin - flip processes on transport . in the absence of spin - flip scattering the currents of spin - up electrons and spin - down electrons are independent .",
    "spin - flip scattering mixes the spin currents and induces current opposite - spin correlations .",
    "these correlations provide additional information about spin - dependent scattering processes and spin accumulation , which is important for spintronic applications .",
    "our considerations are based on non - equilibrium keldysh green functions  @xcite and we use different complementary many - body methods that span the physically relevant regimes . the slave boson mean field approaches ( sbmfa )  @xcite well describe systems close to the kondo fixed point i.e. for the case of fully degenerate deep dot level at low temperatures and low voltages .",
    "two other methods used by us : equation of motion method ( eom )  @xcite and noncrossing approximation ( nca )  @xcite are better adopted for higher temperatures and voltages .",
    "compared with the conductance of a system , shot noise is more difficult to investigate experimentally .",
    "there are several methods to detect noise such as cross correlation  @xcite or squid - based resistance bridge  @xcite .",
    "shot noise occurs when the sample is biased and it can be only detected if the frequency is high enough to overcome extrinsic @xmath9 noise caused by fluctuations in the physical environment and measurement equipment . typically these experiments are performed in the khz to mhz range , sometimes higher  @xcite . in the present paper we focus on the noise power spectrum in the zero - frequency limit , but to gain an understanding of the range of validity of zero - frequency results we compare them with finite frequency calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the single level model of cnt - qd , next we briefly review the many - body techniques used in the discussion and we introduce the expressions for the current and shot noise together with a short comment on the applicability of the latter .",
    "numerical results and their analysis are given in sec .",
    "iii , where we first discuss frequency range of validity of the calculations and compare shot noise for the full spin - orbit degenerate su(4 ) kondo obtained in different approximations and set the results together with analogous for su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "next we discuss the influence on the noise of different symmetry breaking perturbations including parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields , polarization of electrodes and the effect of spin - flip scattering . finally , we give the conclusions in sec .",
    "we consider a single - wall semiconducting carbon nanotube quantum dot coupled to two electrodes which can be either nonmagnetic or ferromagnetic .",
    "cnt exhibits fourfold shell structure in the low energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this electronic behavior originates from a particular combination of the symmetry of the graphene band structure and the quantization of momentum imposed by periodic boundary conditions along the nanotube circumference  @xcite .",
    "the orbital degeneracy can be intuitively viewed to originate from two equivalent ways electrons can circle the graphene cylinder , that is clockwise and anti - clockwise . the rotational motion results in additional to spin orbital magnetic moments of electrons , typically an order of magnitude larger than bohr magneton . in the following we use the single energy shell model , which corresponds to the case of a short cnt - qd , but it gives also a qualitative insight into the many level su(4 ) kondo problem for large separations between the levels  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system , which includes different symmetry breaking perturbations discussed in this paper takes the general form :    @xmath10    the first two terms describe noninteracting itinerant electrons in the leads : @xmath11    ( @xmath12 ) for the left electrode and ( @xmath13 ) for the right , @xmath14 is the energy of an electron in the lead @xmath15 with wave vector @xmath16 , spin @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and orbital number @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",

    "the magnetic field enters only diagonal elements of the hamiltonian . for the considered low magnetic fields it is assumed that off diagonal elements are not affected ( no peierls substitution ) .",
    "the next two terms in ( 3 ) describe intra ( @xmath37 ) and interorbital ( @xmath38 ) coulomb interactions and the last term denotes the possible spin - flip scattering in the dot . finally , the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath39 , in eq .",
    "( 1 ) takes the form :    @xmath40    the spin - dependent coupling strength to the lead @xmath15 is described by @xmath41 .",
    "it is assumed that the tunneling amplitude @xmath42 is independent of the spin and only the spin - dependent density of states accounts for the ferromagnetic properties of the leads .",
    "we assume in the following equal coupling for both orbitals @xmath43 , but in general allow for the left - right asymmetry @xmath44 .",
    "one can express coupling strengths for the spin - majority ( spin - minority ) electron bands using polarization parameter as @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian of the full spin - orbital symmetry @xmath48 corresponds in the present formulation to the case of paramagnetic electrodes ( @xmath49 ) , vanishing magnetic field ( @xmath50 ) , full chiral symmetry ( orbital degeneracy @xmath51 ) and lack of the spin - flip processes at the dot ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we briefly review now the different complementary methods employed by us to find the single particle green functions .",
    "concerning eom approach we present the calculations for both the infinite coulomb interaction limit and for coulomb parameters corresponding to the typical charging energies of cnt - qds .",
    "we compare the results with the slave boson calculations performed in infinite coulomb interaction limit .",
