    "this brief analysis is very relevant on one hand for the purposes of ref .  @xcite as it embodies the first proof of strong monogamy beyond strong symmetry requirements ; while on the other hand , in the scope of the present paper , it enables us to regard the considerations of the previous subsection as mathematically valid over all the parameter space , and not only in the limit of high squeezing @xmath31 .",
    "from a practical point of view , two - mode squeezing transformations are basic tools in the domain of quantum optics @xcite ( they occur e.g.  in parametric down - conversions ) , and the amount of producible squeezing in experiments is constantly improving @xcite . only technological , no _ a priori _ limitations need to be overcome to increase @xmath31 and/or @xmath30 to the point of engineering excellent approximations to the demonstrated promiscuous entanglement structure in multimode states of light and atoms ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "to make an explicit example , already with realistic squeezing degrees like @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( corresponding to @xmath108 3 db and 10 db , respectively ) , one has a bipartite entanglement of @xmath109 ebits ( corresponding to a gaussian entanglement of formation @xcite of @xmath110ebits ) , coexisting with a residual multipartite entanglement of @xmath111 ebits , of which the tripartite portion is at most @xmath112 ebits .",

    "when the quantum correlations arise among degrees of freedom spanning an infinite - dimensional space of states ( characterized by unbounded mean energy ) , an accordingly infinite freedom is tolerated for qi to be doled out .",
    "the construction presented here can be straightforwardly extended to investigate the increasingly richer structure of entanglement sharing in @xmath0-mode ( @xmath0 even ) gaussian states via additional pairs of two - mode squeezing operations which further redistribute entanglement .",
    "notice once more that the promiscuous entanglement distribution happens with no violation of the _ a priori _ monogamy constraints that retain their general validity in quantum mechanics .",
    "the motivation is the following . in the cv scenario , naively speaking , if one writes from ineq .",
    "( [ ckwine ] ) that the entanglement between one mode and the rest is equal to the sum of bipartite entanglements plus the residual multipartite entanglement , one can in principle approach the limiting ` fully promiscuous ' case `` @xmath116 '' .",
    "the only restriction imposed by monogamy is to bound the divergence rates of the individual entanglement contributions as the squeezing parameters are increased . within the restricted hilbert space of four or more qubits , instead ,",
    "an analogous entanglement structure between the single qubits is strictly forbidden ( one can either have `` @xmath117 '' or `` @xmath118 '' ) .",
    "our results open original perspectives for the understanding and characterization of entanglement in multiparticle systems .",
    "gaussian states with finite squeezing ( finite mean energy ) are somehow analogous to discrete systems with an effective dimension related to the squeezing degree . as the promiscuous entanglement sharing arises in gaussian states by asymptotically increasing the squeezing to infinity , it is natural to expect that dimension - dependent families of states will exhibit an entanglement structure gradually more promiscuous with increasing hilbert space dimension towards the cv limit .",
    "let us further clarify this point . in the bipartite , pure - state instance ,",
    "a two - mode squeezed gaussian state @xmath119 with squeezing @xmath120 has exactly the same entanglement @xmath121 ( quantified by the logarithmic negativity @xcite ) as a maximally entangled state of two qu@xmath122its , @xmath123 .",

    "instead that three - mode gaussian states can never achieve such a distribution of entanglement @xcite ( the reduced two - mode entanglement stays finite even for infinite squeezing ) , and in this paper we had to resort to four - mode states with broken symmetry to demonstrate unlimited promiscuity in the gaussian scenario .",

    "once a more comprehensive understanding will be available of the distributed entanglement structure in high - dimensional and cv systems ( also beyond gaussian states ) , the interesting task of devising new protocols to translate such potential into full - power qi processing implementations can be addressed as well . in this respect , it is worth remarking again that non - gaussian states , which by virtue of the extremality theorem @xcite are systematically more entangled that gaussian ones at fixed second moments in a bipartite scenario , appear also to have a richer structure when entanglement sharing is addressed . in the tripartite case , for instance",
