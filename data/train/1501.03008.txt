    "entanglement @xcite and quantum discord @xcite are the two aspects of quantum correlations and have the great potential in quantum information processing , which have many applications for future quantum technologies .",
    "the prominent role of entanglement have been investigated in teleportation , quantum secure cryptography , quantum games , quantum imaging , superdense coding and so on @xcite .",
    "the quantum correlations are very much fragile to the environmental interactions and they may loose their correlations . as a result they may lead to entanglement sudden death ( esd ) for finite time @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of esd in quantum information is a subject of investigation for practical quantum information processing .",
    "the two qubit system is the simplest bipartite system in quantum information that can be prepared either in pure or mixed bipartite quantum entangled states .",
    "werner states are quantum states which are mixed two qubit entangled states @xcite .",
    "munro et al . have investigated another class of maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) @xcite , which have more entanglement than werner states and these are experimentally verified also @xcite .",
    "two qubit states have been realized in a variety of physical systems .",
    "so it is interesting to study the evolution of quantum correlations in physical systems under various interactions . in this paper",
    "we study the influence of dzyaloshinshkii - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite on the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord @xcite in two qubit mixed bipartite states ( i.e. werner states and mems ) .",
    "we consider a pair of qubits and one auxiliary qubit , which interact with any one of the qubits of the pair through dm interaction .",
    "dm interaction plays a major role in quantum information processing and there is a vast literature in which the various quantum spin chains embedded in optical lattices governed by different models ( heisenberg , ising , frustrated etc . ) @xcite have been studied under dm interaction .",
    "dm interaction plays an important role to entangle , disentangle and amplifying the entanglement in quantum systems .",
    "but sometimes it may be the killer of entanglement in some quantum states .",
    "this has been shown by zang et al . by considering two qubits a and b prepared in bell states @xcite and a third qubit c which interact via dm interaction with the qubit b.",
    "they have shown that dm interaction amplify and periodically kills the entanglement in two qubit bell states .",
    "the entanglement manipulation can be done by controlling the state ( i.e. probability amplitude ) of the third qubit ( c ) and dm interaction strength .",
    "our observation tells that dm interaction is always not the killer of entanglement in quantum states as some of these remain unaffected by the same @xcite .",
    "recently , we also have shown that the state of auxiliary qubit ( i.e. probability amplitude ) do not influence the entanglement in two parameter qubit - qutrit states @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show that the state of auxiliary qubit ( i.e probability amplitude ) does not come into picture to manipulate the quantum correlations in werner states and mems ; only dm interaction strength influences the quantum correlations .",
    "so in this case one can avoid to prepare the specific state of auxiliary qubit to manipulate the entanglement in both werner states and mems . avoiding the state preparation",
    "can help in cost reduction in quantum information processing .",

    "we consider a qubit ( a)-qubit ( b ) pair and an auxiliary qubit ( c ) which interact with the qubit ( b ) of the pair through dm interaction . the hamiltonian of the system can be framed as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hamiltonian of qubit ( a ) and qubit ( b ) and @xmath2 is the interaction hamiltonian of qubit ( b ) and qubit ( c ) . here",

    "we obtain the reduced time evolution density matrix by taking the partial transpose operation over the auxiliary qubit c. we observe that the factor @xmath47 has been involved with every element of the matrix , so by applying the normalization condition given in eq .",
