    "entanglement is one of the most important resources for quantum communication and information processing including quantum cryptography , teleportation , and superdense coding . on this account ,",
    "the research on entanglement has considerably been developed and has improved the quantum information science in recent years . in particular , the quest for proper measures of entanglement has received a great deal of attention , and several measures of entanglement , such as the negativity and the entanglement of formation , have been proposed @xcite .    peres - horodeckis criterion for separability @xcite leads a natural entanglement measure , called the _ negativity _",
    "@xmath3 , defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the partial transpose of a state @xmath6 in a hilbert space @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the trace norm . vidal and",
    "werner  @xcite defined the negativity of a state @xmath6 as @xmath9 , which corresponds to the absolute value of the sum of negative eigenvalues of @xmath5 , and which vanishes for separable states . for a maximally entangled pure state such as one of the bell states ,",
    "this quantity is strictly less than one . in order for any maximally entangled pure state in @xmath1 quantum system to have the negativity one , it must be defined as .",
    "we note that the negativity is an entanglement monotone  @xcite under local quantum operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite , and that it is a measure of entanglement which can be computed effectively for any state .",
    "however , although the positivity of the partial transpose is a necessary and sufficient condition for nondistillability in @xmath1 quantum system @xcite , there exist entangled states with positive partial transposition ( ppt ) in any bipartite system except for in @xmath10 and @xmath11 quantum systems @xcite , and hence it is not sufficient for the negativity to be a good measure of entanglement even in @xmath1 quantum system .",
    "in this paper we consider @xmath1 quantum systems for @xmath2 , and exhibit a two - parameter class of states in @xmath1 quantum system , which can be obtained from an arbitrary state by means of locc and are invariant under all unitary operations of the form @xmath12 on @xmath1 quantum system .",
    "we show that a state in the two - parameter class has a ppt if and only if the state is separable , so that the negativity can be a measure to quantify the amount of entanglement of states in the class . we remark that a finite dimensional truncation of a single two - level atom interacting with a single - mode quantized field @xcite , can be regarded as a @xmath1 quantum system",
    ".    the _ entanglement of formation _ is defined to be the convex - roof extension of the pure - state entanglement , that is , the minimum average of the pure - state entanglement over all ensemble decompositions of a given state @xmath6 , @xmath13 here , the pure - state entanglement @xmath14 is defined as the entropy of subsystem @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "since the concept of the pure - state entanglement @xmath14 has most widely been accepted as an entanglement measure for pure states and the entanglement of formation is its natural extension as seen in , the entanglement of formation is one of the best measures for bipartite quantum systems which have been known so far .",
    "nevertheless , there is no known explicit formula for the entanglement of formation of states in a general quantum system except for states in @xmath10 quantum system @xcite , the isotropic states and the werner states in @xmath18 quantum system @xcite , and states of the specific form @xcite . for @xmath1 quantum system ,",
    "only a lower bound on the entanglement of formation is given by decomposing a @xmath1 dimensional hilbert space into many @xmath19 dimensional subspaces @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a lower bound and a tight upper bound on the entanglement of formation for the two - parameter class of states .",
    "the explicit calculations of the negativity and bounds on the entanglement of formation show that the entanglement of formation of any state in the two - parameter class can not exceed its negativity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in we exhibit a two - parameter class of states and a procedure involving only locc which transform an arbitrary state into one of states in the class , and show that the states in the class are invariant under all unitary operations of the form @xmath12 . in",
    "we explicitly calculate the negativity , and a lower bound and a tight upper bound on the entanglement of formation for the two - parameter class , and compare its negativity with the entanglement of formation .",
    "finally , in we summarize our results and discuss a generalization of the two - parameter class into a higher dimensional system .",
    "we consider the following class of states with two real parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 in @xmath1 quantum system : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath1 quantum system , @xmath24 and the parameter @xmath25 is dependent on @xmath20 and @xmath21 by the unit trace condition , @xmath26 from the unit trace condition in we can readily obtain the domain for the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we note that the states of the form @xmath29 for @xmath30 are equal to werner states  @xcite in @xmath10 quantum system , that the states are entangled and distillable if and only if @xmath31 , and that for @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the binary shannon entropy .",
    "we are going to show now that an arbitrary state @xmath6 in @xmath1 quantum system can be transformed to a state of the form @xmath0 in by locc .",
    "in other words , we will show that there exist unitary operators @xmath35 and probabilities @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for some @xmath27 and @xmath28 , using the method similar to those presented by bennett _ et al",
    ". _ @xcite and dr _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "we define the operation @xmath38 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "we first perform @xmath41 with probability @xmath42 , while with probability @xmath42 no operation is performed , that is , @xmath43 let us now define the operation @xmath35 by @xmath44 for @xmath45 , and then for each @xmath46 , perform @xmath47 with probability @xmath42 , while applying the identity operation with probability @xmath42 , respectively . here , we remark that @xmath48 .",
    "we now perform @xmath49 with probability @xmath42 as in , and then perform the swap operator @xmath50 ( @xmath51 for @xmath52 ) with probability @xmath42 .",
    "then we obtain a state of the following form : @xmath53 let @xmath54 be the unitary operator defined by @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . now we perform the following operation : @xmath62 here , we also remark that @xmath63 for any @xmath64 .",
    "then a state in now has the form @xmath65 let @xmath66 be the unitary operator defined as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "after performing as follows : @xmath71 let us perform the sequence of the previous operations again .",
    "then one can easily check that one of states with two parameters in is obtained , that is , there exist unitary operators @xmath35 and probabilities @xmath36 satisfying , and that furthermore if a state @xmath6 is given by @xmath72 then the two - parameter state transformed by the above procedure becomes @xmath0 in where @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    noting that @xmath75 for any @xmath76 in the group @xmath77 defined in , we can readily show that @xmath0 is invariant under all @xmath12 , that is , for any @xmath78 , @xmath79 we now define the ( @xmath12)-_twirling _ superoperator @xmath80 as @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the normalized haar measure on @xmath83 .",
    "then it follows from and that @xmath84 for some @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and that @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "we remark that the negativity and the entanglement of formation are entanglement monotones  @xcite .",
    "thus , it follows that the negativity and the entanglement of formation for a given @xmath6 are not less than those for @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "in this section , we consider two measures of entanglement for @xmath0 , the negativity and the entanglement of formation , and explicitly calculate the value of its negativity and bounds on its entanglement of formation .    in order to calculate the negativity of @xmath0",
    ", we have to compute its partial transpose:@xmath87 since @xmath88 if and only if @xmath89 is positive , the negativity of @xmath0 is @xmath90 , whose graph is shown in",
    ".    then the domain of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath0 consists of two triangular regions , the ppt region satisfying @xmath91 and the nonpositive partial transposition ( npt ) region satisfying @xmath92 , as shown in .",
    "we note that all states in the ppt region are separable since three states , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , corresponding to the vertices of the ppt region are separable and all states in the region are convex combinations of the three states .",
    "we now consider the entanglement of formation for @xmath0 .",
    "even though it has not been known whether the explicit formula of the entanglement of formation for states in @xmath1 quantum system can be computed or not , one can readily compute one of its lower bounds  @xcite , @xmath96 where @xmath97 @xmath98 is the wootters cuncurrence  @xcite in @xmath10 dimensional subsystem which is supported by the bases @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the lower bound in is @xmath103 since @xmath104 and @xmath105 unless @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for @xmath108 quantum system ,",
    "the lower bound on @xmath109 is plotted in .    in order to obtain a tight upper bound of @xmath109 , we consider two - parameter states satisfying @xmath110 , that is , the states corresponding to the line through two points @xmath111 and @xmath112 in .",
    "then the states are of the following form : @xmath113 we note that is an eigenvalue decomposition of a state @xmath114 , and that @xmath115 in view of the convexity of @xmath116 .",
    "let @xmath117 be an optimal decomposition for its entanglement of formation when @xmath118 .",
    "by hughston , jozsa and wootters theorem  @xcite , there exists a @xmath119 unitary matrix @xmath76 , @xmath120 being greater than or equal to @xmath121 , the rank of @xmath122 , such that for each @xmath123 @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "thus it can be obtained from that @xmath126 where @xmath127 then it follows from and the concavity of @xmath128 that @xmath129 since the von neumann entropy of a pure state is vanished . hence , from and the unitarity of @xmath76 , we obtain the following inequality : @xmath130 by two inequalities ( [ eq : less_than_gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : eof_s ] ) we conclude that @xmath131 .",
    "we now consider the states corresponding to @xmath132 in the interior of the npt region , that is , @xmath132 satisfying @xmath133 . by virtue of the convexity of the entanglement of formation , for a given @xmath132",
    "the following inequality can be obtained : @xmath134/(n-2),t[2n_{(\\alpha,\\gamma)}-1]+(1-t)n_{(\\alpha,\\gamma)}\\right)}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & \\le & t\\cdot e_f\\left(\\rho_{\\left([1-n_{(\\alpha,\\gamma)}]/(n-2),2n_{(\\alpha,\\gamma)}-1\\right)}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( 1-t)\\cdot e_f\\left(\\rho_{\\left(0,n_{(\\alpha,\\gamma)}\\right)}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & t\\cdot [ 2n_{(\\alpha,\\gamma)}-1 ] + ( 1-t)\\cdot \\mathcal{e}(2n_{(\\alpha,\\gamma ) } ) \\label{eq : upperbound1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath135 , and @xmath136 is chosen by @xmath137/(n-2),\\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma & = & t\\cdot[2n_{(\\alpha,\\gamma)}-1]+(1-t)\\cdot n_{(\\alpha,\\gamma)}. \\label{eq : t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] choosing the appropriate @xmath136 satisfying , we are straightforwardly able to calculate the following upper bound on @xmath109:@xmath138 for @xmath108 quantum system the upper bound ( [ eq : upperbound2 ] ) on @xmath109 is shown in .",
    "we remark that the entanglement of formation and its upper bound ( [ eq : upperbound2 ] ) have the same values for the states corresponding to three edges of the npt region in .",
    "therefore , we can not derive any upper bound tighter than the upper bound ( [ eq : upperbound2 ] ) from the method using the convexity of the entanglement of formation as in . from this viewpoint",
    ", we can say that the upper bound ( [ eq : upperbound2 ] ) is a tight upper bound on @xmath139 .",
    "we note that @xmath140 and that @xmath141 for all @xmath28 .",
    "thus , it follows that the entanglement of formation of any @xmath0 can not exceed its negativity , that is , @xmath142 for any @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we exhibited a two - parameter class of states @xmath0 in @xmath1 quantum system , found that an arbitrary state can be transformed into @xmath0 by means of locc , and showed that @xmath0 is invariant under unitary operations of the form @xmath12 on @xmath1 quantum system .",
    "we finally investigated the entanglement for @xmath0 , by computing two measures of entanglement , the negativity and the entanglement of formation .    for a higher dimensional quantum system , that is , an @xmath143 quantum system ( @xmath144 ) , we can exhibit a two - parameter class given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 furthermore , we can show that any state in @xmath143 quantum system can be transformed into a state of the form of by locc , and that any state in this class is ( @xmath12)-invariant for all unitary @xmath76 in the group @xmath148 defined in .",
