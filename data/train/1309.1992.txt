    "very unusual transport properties of graphene are mostly related to the electronic energy structure of low - energy states in this material , that can be described by the ultrarelativistic dirac hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite the main parameter of this model , electron velocity , does not depend on the electron energy , and is rather high ( about @xmath0  m / s ) .",
    "besides , the electron backscattering from impurities is effectively suppressed in graphene ( `` klein tunneling '' @xcite ) .",
    "it results in a rather high mobility of electrons in the graphene bulk despite possible inhomogeneities .",
    "typically , the bulk electron mean - free - path @xmath1 is just several times smaller than the size of graphene flakes @xmath2 or even comparable with it .",
    "this may lead to important contribution of electron scattering from the edges .",
    "the main parameter , which determines the condition for essential contribution of the edge scattering , is @xmath3 . for @xmath4",
    "the edge scattering leads to a small correction to the transport coefficient but in the opposite ( ballistic ) case , the edge scattering is the main mechanism of momentum relaxation . ballistic regime can be experimentally reached for graphene samples . @xcite",
    "the effect of electron scattering from the surface has been thoroughly studied in the past for ordinary metals and semiconductors . in the framework of kinetic equation approach ,",
    "the main problem of the theory is the boundary condition for the electron distribution function at the surface .",
    "it was proposed by fuchs to use a constant specular factor to formulate the boundary condition .",
    "@xcite it turned out , however , that this approach is too rough to explain numerous experiments . besides , such boundary condition is not related to any specific mechanism of the surface scattering , and quite obviously does not take into account different character of scattering of electrons incoming under small and large angles to the surface .",
    "the problem has been examined in many papers ( see , e.g. , refs . [ ] ) and review articles [ ] accounting for different scattering mechanisms from different kind of defects , including nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities , surface roughness , etc .    here",
    "we discuss the role of edge scattering in graphene .",
    "the essential property of graphene , which makes the results different from the above mentioned results for conventional metallic systems is the behavior of the wave function of electron near the edge .",
    "since the low - energy electrons in graphene are described by relativistic dirac model , one can not assume zero wavefunction at the edge , which is the standard way to introduce the metal surface .",
    "as a result , the surface scattering vanishes for the sliding electrons with the momentum parallel to the surface , which is especially essential for the ballistic regime @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite the boundary conditions for the wave function in graphene turn out to depend on orientation of the edge with respect to the crystal lattice , on possible edge reconstruction and on the chemical passivation of the edges .",
    "@xcite we will show in this work that it leads , indeed , to an essential difference in the results from those for conventional metals .",
    "several types of the boundary conditions have been proposed .",
    "the so - called berry - mondragon @xcite ( or infinite - mass ) boundary conditions are quite universal to describe the confinement of dirac electrons in a restricted region as they are not related to the orientation of the boundary .",
    "they correspond to the single dirac cone approximation and therefore are applicable for the case of smooth enough disorder near the edges .",
    "it seems to be a good approximation for chemically functionalized edges since the first - principle calculations show that electronic structure is affected at distances much larger than the lattice constant .",
    "@xcite    the microscopic model for the boundary conditions and the edge states in graphene , which is based on the real crystallic structure and uses tight - binding approximation , has been considered in several papers .",
    "@xcite it was found that for the zigzag boundary , one of the wavefunction components should be necessarily zero at the edge ( the other one is zero at the opposite edge ) .",
    "for the armchair boundary it is important to consider two nonequivalent dirac points ( i.e. , electrons from different valleys ) , and the boundary conditions input some phase - dependent relations between the wave functions components of different valleys .",
    "it was shown also that for terminated honeycomb lattice zigzag boundary conditions are robust whereas the armchair ones are exceptional .",
    "@xcite we will focus therefore on two cases , berry - mondragon and zigzag edges . in both these cases one can neglect intervalley scattering .    however , the situation with graphene nanoribbons and nanoflakes can be more complicated because of the crystallic reconstruction of the edge , which makes some types of the edges like , e.g. , `` reczag '' reconstruction , energetically more favorable .",
    "@xcite the boundary conditions for this case has been derived in ref .",
    "[ ] . in general , they include the intervalley scattering , which is also relevant for the case of atomically sharp disorder at the edges .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii we consider the general solution of the kinetic equation for the graphene nanoribbon , in section iii we derive boundary conditions for the kinetic equation for the nanoribbon with berry - mondragon and zigzag boundary conditions , the edge is supposed to be straight line with some defects on it .",
    "we will show that the surface scattering vanishes for the sliding electrons in the case of zigzag boundaries but not for the berry - mondragon case . in section",
    "iv we calculate the contribution of the edge scattering to the conductance of graphene nanoribbon for @xmath4 . in section v the opposite limit @xmath5 is considered . in section",
    "vi we consider the scattering by curved edges and in sections vii and viii discuss the role of intervalley edge scattering . in section",
    "ix we consider the case of graphene circular flake ( nanodisc ) with berry - mondragon boundary conditions .",
    "we finalize with the discussion of the results ( section x ) and conclusions ( section xi ) .",
    "let us consider first a narrow graphene ribbon of width @xmath2 along axis @xmath6 , so that the graphene edges are located at @xmath7 and @xmath8 . we assume first that the ribbon edges are ideally flat ( straight lines ) .",

    "in such a ballistic limit the functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 do not depend on @xmath24 , and the electron scattering from the edges should be directly included into the right hand part of the kinetic equation ( 1 ) ( see below ) .",

    "they have asymptotics for large @xmath285 @xmath286 we can use these asymptotics as we are interested in behavior of the wave functions near the disc edge , i.e. , for @xmath287 .",
    "thus we find for the spinor components of the eigenfunctions @xmath288 correspondingly , the eigenfunctions at @xmath289 ( @xmath290 ) are @xmath291 now we use the berry - mondragon boundary conditions for the wave functions at the disc edge .",
    "in the case of berry - mondragon boundary conditions , the equations for @xmath292 ( in vacuum ) , assuming @xmath293 @xmath294 it gives us as the solution , decreasing with @xmath295 , the modified bessel functions @xmath296 with asymptotics for @xmath285 @xmath297 correspondingly we take the wavefunction at @xmath292 @xmath298 where @xmath95 is a constant . using ( 83 ) and ( 87 ) and matching these spinor components at @xmath299",

    "the effect of surface scattering on the conductivity of thin films and wires has been considered first @xcite by using a constant specular factor @xmath314 , which characterizes scattering properties of the surface , so that the value of @xmath315 corresponds to specular scattering and @xmath316 to the diffusive limit ( i.e. , when the probabilities of scattering to any angles are equal ) .",
    "as it was shown later ( see , e.g. , review articles [ ] ) , in reality the probability of scattering to a certain angle strongly depends on the direction of momentum of incoming electron , so that the scattering at small angle can be almost specular , whereas it is rather diffusive for electrons incoming perpendicular to the surface . hence , the results of the calculation based on kinetic equation approach @xcite has been compared to the results of approximation of constant parameter @xmath314 to show that the specular parameter is not a constant , and the main contribution to conductivity is related to most sliding electrons .    in this work we use essentially the same kinetic equation approach for the case of two - dimensional graphene .",
    "since graphene is the two - dimensional crystal , there is no scattering from 2d surface as in thin films , and only the edge scattering is essential .",
    "thus , the direct comparison of the surface scattering in thin films and in graphene does not make much sense .",
    "nevertheless , we found for not too narrow graphene ribbon that its conductivity can be presented as @xmath317 , with @xmath246 depending on the edge type and on the incoming angle ( described by the parameter @xmath129 ( see eqs .",

    "@xmath246 substitutes the specular parameter @xmath314 and includes integration over all incoming angles .",
    "it should be stressed that the key point in the kinetic equation method relating the distribution functions of incoming and outgoing electrons is the probability of electron scattering at the surface . as we found , in the case of graphene this probability is quite different for different types of the edges due to different boundary conditions for the wave functions .",
    "in the case of zigzag boundary , one component of the wave function goes to zero at the surface . as a result ,",
    "the matrix element for the surface scattering at zigzag boundary has effectively the same form as in conventional metal ",
    "it is proportional to @xmath210 , i.e. , it is small for sliding electrons ( see eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 20 ) ) . in contrary",
    ", there is no such smallness for the berry - mondragon boundary .",
    "our calculations in the ballistic regime , @xmath5 show that in the case of zigzag boundary , the relaxation time is formally divergent for @xmath319 .",
    "namely , if @xmath156 , we get @xmath320 ( see eq .",
    "correspondingly , by using ( 41 ) we obtain @xmath321 .",
    "note that the corresponding result is @xmath322 for thin films and @xmath323 for thin wires .    when the correction to relaxation time is mostly due to the scattering from curved edges we found @xmath324 with the coefficient depending on the variation of ribbon width . for thin ( ballistic ) curved ribbon , @xmath325",
    ", we found @xmath326 ( where @xmath204 is the characteristic length of fluctuations ) , see .",

    "note that there is no problem with sliding electrons for the case of ballistic disc because the berry - mondragon boundary conditions for graphene disc lead to a constant electron relaxation time , with @xmath327 ( see eq .",
    "we have considered different models of the boundary cnditions at the graphene edge to calculate the electron relaxation time and conductance in graphene nanoribbons .",
    "we have found that in the case of zigzag boundary the effect of edge scattering is very strong .",
    "similar to the surface scattering of electrons in conventional metals , sliding electrons do not scatter from the zigzag edge .",
