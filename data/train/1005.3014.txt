    "the use of probability to reason about uncertainty is key to modern science and engineering , and the operation of _ conditioning _ , used to perform bayesian inductive reasoning in probabilistic models , directly raises many of its most important computational problems .",
    "faced with probabilistic models of increasingly complex phenomena that stretch or exceed the limitations of existing representations and algorithms , researchers have proposed new representations and formal languages for describing joint distributions on large collections of random variables , and have developed new algorithms for performing automated probabilistic inference .",

    "can we hope to automate probabilistic reasoning via a general inference algorithm that can compute conditional probabilities for an _ arbitrary _ computable joint distribution ?",
    "we demonstrate that there are computable joint distributions with noncomputable conditional distributions . of course",
    ", the fact that generic algorithms can not exist for computing conditional probabilities does not rule out the possibility that large classes of distributions may be amenable to automated inference .",
    "the challenge for mathematical theory is to explain the widespread success of probabilistic methods and characterize the circumstances when conditioning is possible . in this vein , we describe broadly applicable conditions under which conditional probabilities are computable .      within probabilistic artificial intelligence ( ai ) and machine learning ,",

    "probabilistic programming_. probabilistic programming languages themselves build on modern programming languages and their facilities for recursion , abstraction , modularity , etc . , to enable practitioners to define intricate , in some cases infinite - dimensional , models by implementing a generative process that produces an exact sample from the model s joint distribution .",
    "( see , e.g. , ibal @xcite , @xmath0@xcite , church @xcite , and @xcite . for related and earlier efforts , see , e.g. , pha @xcite , infer.net @xcite , markov logic @xcite .",
    "probabilistic programming languages have been the focus of a long tradition of research within programming languages , model checking and formal methods . ) in many of these languages , one can easily represent the higher - order stochastic processes ( e.g. , distributions on data structures , distributions on functions , and distributions on distributions ) that are essential building blocks in modern nonparametric bayesian statistics .",
    "in fact , the most expressive such languages are each capable of describing the same robust class as the others  the class of _ computable distributions _ , which delineates those from which a probabilistic turing machine can sample to arbitrary accuracy .",
    "traditionally , inference algorithms for probabilistic models have been derived and implemented by hand .",
    "in contrast , probabilistic programming systems have introduced varying degrees of support for computing conditional distributions . given the rate of progress toward broadening the scope of these algorithms",
    ", one might hope that there would eventually be a generic algorithm supporting the entire class of computable distributions .    despite recent progress towards a general such algorithm , support for conditioning with respect to continuous random variables",
    "has remained ad - hoc and incomplete .",

    ", we work within the framework of _ computable probability theory _ , which pertains to the computability of distributions , random variables , and probabilistic operations ; and builds on the classical computability theory of deterministic functions . just as the notion of a turing machine allows one to prove results about discrete computations performed using an arbitrary ( sufficiently powerful ) programming language , the notion of a probabilistic turing machine provides a basis for precisely describing the operations that probabilistic programming languages are capable of performing .",

    "we present the necessary definitions and results from computable probability theory .      for an experiment with a discrete set of outcomes , computing conditional probabilities",
    "is , in principle , straightforward as it is simply a ratio of probabilities .",
    "however , in the case of conditioning on the value of a continuous random variable , this ratio is undefined .",
    "furthermore , in modern bayesian statistics , and especially the probabilistic programming setting , it is common to place distributions on higher - order objects , and so one is already in a situation where elementary notions of conditional probability are insufficient and more sophisticated measure - theoretic notions are necessary .",
    "kolmogorov @xcite gave an axiomatic characterization of conditional probabilities , but this definition provides no recipe for their calculation .",
    "other issues also arise : in this setting , conditional probabilities are formalized as measurable functions that are defined only up to measure zero sets . therefore , without additional assumptions , a conditional probability is not necessarily well - defined for any particular value of the conditioning random variable .",
    "this has long been understood as a challenge for statistical applications , in which one wants to evaluate conditional probabilities given particular values for observed random variables . in this paper , we are therefore especially interested in situations where it makes sense to ask for the conditional distribution given a particular point .",
    "in particular , we focus on the case when conditional distributions are everywhere or almost everywhere continuous , and thus can be given a unique definition for individual points in the support of the underlying measure .",
    "as we will argue , this is necessary if there is to be any hope of conditioning being computable .    under certain conditions , such as",
    "when conditional densities exist , conditioning can proceed using the classic bayes rule ; however , it may not be possible to compute the density of a computable distribution ( if the density exists at all ) .",
    "the probability and statistics literature contains many ad - hoc techniques for calculating conditional probabilities in special circumstances , and this state of affairs motivated much work on constructive definitions ( such as those due to tjur @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , pfanzagl @xcite , and rao @xcite , @xcite ) , but this work has often not been sensitive to issues of computability .",
    "we recall the basics of the measure - theoretic approach to conditional distributions in section  [ conddist ] , and in section  [ ccd2 ] we use notions from computable probability theory to consider the sense in which conditioning could be potentially computable .",
    "conditional probabilities for computable distributions on finite , discrete sets are clearly computable , but may not be efficiently so . in this",
    "finite discrete setting , there are already interesting questions of computational complexity , which have been explored by a number of authors through extensions of levin s theory of average - case complexity @xcite .",
    "for example , under cryptographic assumptions , it is difficult to sample from the conditional distribution of a uniformly - distributed binary string of length @xmath1 given its image under a one - way function . this can be seen to follow from the work of ben - david , chor , goldreich , and luby @xcite in their theory of polynomial - time samplable distributions , which has since been extended by yamakami @xcite and others . extending these complexity results to the more general setting considered here could bear on the practice of statistical ai and machine learning .",
    "osherson , stob , and weinstein @xcite study learning theory in the setting of _ identifiability in the limit _",
    "( see @xcite and @xcite for more details on this setting ) and prove that a certain type of `` computable bayesian '' learner fails to identify the index of a ( computably enumerable ) set that is `` computably identifiable '' in the limit .",
    "more specifically , a so - called `` bayesian learner '' is required to return an index for a set with the highest conditional probability given a finite prefix of an infinite sequence of random draws from the unknown set .",
    "an analysis by roy @xcite of their construction reveals that the conditional distribution of the index given the infinite sequence is an everywhere discontinuous function ( on every measure one set ) , hence noncomputable for much the same reason as our elementary construction involving a mixture of measures concentrated on the rationals and on the irrationals ( see section  [ sec : discontinuous ] ) . as we argue , it is more appropriate to study the operator when it is restricted to those random variables whose conditional distributions admit versions that are continuous everywhere , or at least on a measure one set .    our work is distinct from the study of conditional distributions with respect to priors that are universal for partial computable functions ( as defined using kolmogorov complexity ) by solomonoff @xcite , zvonkin and levin @xcite , and hutter @xcite .",
    "the computability of conditional distributions also has a rather different character in takahashi s work on the algorithmic randomness of points defined using universal martin - lf tests @xcite .",
    "the objects with respect to which one is conditioning in these settings are typically _ computably enumerable _ , but not computable . in the present paper , we are interested in the problem of computing conditional distributions of random variables that are _ computable _ , even though the conditional distribution may itself be noncomputable .    in the most abstract setting ,",
    "conditional probabilities can be constructed as radon - nikodym derivatives .",
    "in work motivated by questions in algorithmic randomness , hoyrup and rojas @xcite study notions of computability for absolute continuity and for radon - nikodym derivatives as elements in @xmath2 , i.e. , the space of integrable functions . they demonstrate that there are computable measures whose radon - nikodym derivatives are not computable as points in @xmath2 , but these counterexamples do not correspond with conditional probabilities of computable random variables .",
    "hoyrup , rojas and weihrauch @xcite show an equivalence between the problem of computing general radon - nikodym derivatives as elements in @xmath2 and computing the characteristic function of computably enumerable sets .",
    "however , conditional probabilities are a special case of radon - nikodym derivatives , and moreover , a computable element in @xmath2 is not well - defined at points , and so is not ideal for statistical purposes . using their machinery , we demonstrate the non-@xmath2-computability of our main construction .",
    "but the main goal of our paper is to provide a detailed analysis of the situation where it makes sense to ask for the conditional probability at points , which is the more relevant scenario for statistical inference .",
    "following our presentation of computable probability theory and conditional probability in sections  [ compprob ] through [ ccd2 ] , we provide our main positive and negative results about the computability of conditional probability , which we now summarize .    in proposition  [ discontinuouscond ]",
    ", we construct a pair @xmath3 of computable random variables such that every version of the conditional probability @xmath4 $ ] is discontinuous everywhere , even when restricted to a @xmath5-measure one subset .",
    "( we make these notions precise in section  [ ccd2 ] . )",
    "the construction makes use of the elementary fact that the indicator function for the rationals in the unit interval ",
    "the so - called dirichlet function  is itself nowhere continuous .    because every function computable on a domain @xmath6 is continuous on @xmath6",
    ", discontinuity is a fundamental barrier to computability , and so this construction rules out the possibility of a completely general algorithm for conditioning .",
    "a natural question is whether conditioning is a computable operation when we restrict the operator to random variables for which _ some _ version of the conditional distribution is continuous everywhere , or at least on a measure one set .",
    "our central result , theorem  [ mainnegativeresult ] , states that conditioning is not a computable operation on computable random variables , even in this restricted setting .",
    "we construct a pair @xmath7 of computable random variables such that there is a version of the conditional distribution @xmath8 $ ] that is continuous on a measure one set , but no version of @xmath8 $ ] is computable .",
    "( indeed , every individual conditional probability fails to be even lower semicomputable on any set of sufficient measure . )",
    "moreover , the noncomputability of @xmath8 $ ] is at least as hard as the halting problem , in that if some oracle @xmath9 computes @xmath8 $ ] , then @xmath9 computes the halting problem .",
    "the construction involves encoding the halting times of all turing machines into the conditional distribution @xmath10 $ ] , while ensuring that the joint distribution remains computable .",
    "in theorem  [ newmainnegativeresult ] we strengthen our central result by constructing a pair of computable random variables whose conditional distribution is noncomputable but has an everywhere continuous version with infinitely differentiable conditional probabilities .",
    "this construction proceeds by smoothing out the distribution constructed in theorem  [ mainnegativeresult ] , but in such a way that one can still compute the halting problem relative to the conditional distribution .    despite the noncomputability of conditioning in general , conditional distributions are often computable in practice .",
    "we provide some explanation of this phenomenon by characterizing several circumstances in which conditioning _ is _ a computable operation . under suitable computability hypotheses , conditioning is computable in the discrete setting ( lemma  [ discreteconditioning ] ) and where there is a conditional density ( corollary  [ independentdensity ] ) .",
    "we also characterize a situation in which conditioning is possible in the presence of noisy data , capturing many natural models in science and engineering .",
    "let @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 be computable random variables , and suppose that @xmath14 is absolutely continuous with a bounded computable density @xmath15 and @xmath13 is independent of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we can think of @xmath16 as the corruption of an idealized measurement @xmath11 by independent source of additive error @xmath13 . in corollary  [ indnoise ]",
    ", we show that the conditional distribution @xmath17 $ ] is computable ( even if @xmath18 $ ] is not ) .",
