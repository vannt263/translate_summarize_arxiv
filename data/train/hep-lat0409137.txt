    "the fission of the flux string between two heavy quarks , is a key problem of lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "while it is fundamental to a proper understanding of qcd , after nearly 25 years of lattice qcd we are still lacking a convincing demonstration of string breaking through dynamical quarks @xcite .",
    "of course , extremely precise studies of the potential have been carried out , however , even at separations @xmath3 much larger than the anticipated breaking distance of about 1 fm , still a linearly rising potential is found .",
    "this phenomenon is attributed to the insufficient overlap of the wilson loop with the final state at large @xmath4 .    as first suggested back in 1992 by c.  michael , progress in the conceptual understanding of string breaking on the lattice",
    "could be achieved : in ref .",
    "@xcite , qcd was mimicked by the the su(2)-higgs model using a two channel setting .",
    "the authors could confirm the interpretation of string - breaking as a _ dynamical _ level - crossing phenomenon between string - type and meson - type states .",
    "they observed a pronounced gap of the energy levels at the location of the crossing .",
    "a main hindrance of a straightforward application of this procedure to 4-dimensional qcd is the computation of _ all - to - all _ propagators to achieve a proper signal for the heavy - light contributions .",
    "the elements of the @xmath5 mixing matrix  three of which are composites of wilson lines and fermion propagators must be averaged over all spatial lattice sites and dimensions .",
    "this requires the computation of the inverse of the hermitian wilson - dirac matrix , @xmath6 .",
    "as the dimension of @xmath7 is about @xmath8 , the full inverse can not be represented even on high - end systems .    in our investigation",
    ", we employ various `` smearings '' like ape smearing , wuppertal smearing , fat temporal links and a new hopping parameter acceleration .",
    "the latter is shown to enhance the low eigenmode dominance . furthermore , with the truncated eigenmode approximation ( tea ) @xcite , rendered exact by stochastic estimates on the orthogonal subspace , all - to - all propagators can be computed efficiently .",
    "close to the location of qcd string breaking , we deal with a mixture of two states , the initial heavy @xmath9-pair at small separation @xmath4 , represented by the standard wilson - loop @xmath10 , and a final state at large separation @xmath4 , which is given by two _ heavy - light _ mesons .",
    "the interesting physics , _ i.e. _  the fission of the flux - tube , takes place at intermediate @xmath4 .    in the two - channel approach",
    "the correlator is represented as the following @xmath5-matrix @xmath11{w11.eps}\\end{minipage}}}&\\sqrt{n_f}{\\mbox { \\begin{minipage}{15pt}\\includegraphics[width=14pt]{w12.eps}\\end{minipage}}}\\\\ \\sqrt{n_f}{\\mbox { \\begin{minipage}{15pt}\\includegraphics[width=14pt]{w21.eps}\\end{minipage}}}&{\\mbox { \\begin{minipage}{15pt}\\includegraphics[width=14pt]{w22d.eps}\\end{minipage}}}-n_f{\\mbox { \\begin{minipage}{15pt}\\includegraphics[width=14pt]{w22c.eps}\\end{minipage}}}\\end{array}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & e^{-2m_qt}\\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } c_{1,1 } & c_{1,2 } \\\\   c_{2,1 } & c_{2,2 } \\end{array } \\right ) \\label{sbcorrelator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath12 is the correlation function of the static @xmath9 pair , namely the wilson loop , @xmath13 is the correlator of the heavy - light pair , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 the correlator of the transition matrix element .",
    "the light quark propagators in the generalized wilson loops are represented by wavy lines .",
    "the exponential decay of the correlator is found by diagonalization of the real @xmath5 transfer matrix , with the lower eigenvalue being the ground state energy of the system .    as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , characteristic signatures are required in order to `` prove '' string breaking :    1 .",
    "the energy levels show crossing with the asymptotic ground state reaching the same mass as the system of two separated heavy - light mesons .",
    "2 .   at the location of crossing , dynamical string",
    "breaking manifests itself in a pronounced energy level - splitting .",
    "3 .   the transition matrix element @xmath16 will stay finite for @xmath17 .",
    "the basis for our investigation of string breaking are the @xmath0 dynamical configurations produced by the sesam and t@xmath18l groups .",
    "sesam generated 8 ensembles of about 200 decorrelated configurations each on @xmath19 lattices at two different @xmath20-values , 5.6 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and 5.5 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "these ensembles have been analyzed for string breaking in order to determine a @xmath25 combination with small enough sea quark mass still being unaffected by finite - size effects .",
    "we have chosen the pair @xmath26 , @xmath27 .    with a sommer scale of @xmath28 at @xmath29",
    "fm the lattice spacing is @xmath30 fm or @xmath31 gev .",
    "@xmath32 suggests a degenerate quark mass close to the strange quark mass . for the @xmath19 system ,",
    "both the pion window of @xmath33 and the string breaking window with @xmath34 and @xmath35 are not large enough to comfortably accommodate the string breaking experiment .",
    "we chose to use our t@xmath18l configurations generated on @xmath36 lattices . here",
    "the windows are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "183 decorrelated configurations were analyzed for wilson loops , 20 decorrelated configurations were analyzed for fermion lines .",
    "we use a set of mutually optimized methods to improve the ground state overlap which reduce the statistical error by a least a factor of 5 : + * ape smearing . *",
    "ape smearing is carried out on the gauge fields with @xmath40 and @xmath41 : @xmath42\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * wuppertal smearing * with @xmath43 and linear combinations of @xmath44 : @xmath45 * fat temporal links ( hyp ) *  la hasenfratz and knechtli can lead to an exponential improvement of the signal quality . + * hopping parameter acceleration ( hpa ) . *",
    "the @xmath46th power of the wilson hopping term , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , connects sites at distance @xmath46 and less .",
    "multiplying @xmath49 by @xmath47 leads to @xmath50 .",
    "thus , at distance @xmath46 , the first @xmath51 terms do not contribute , and the low eigenmode dominance is enhanced , since with @xmath52 we have @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , we improve @xmath6 by the * truncated eigenmode approximation ( tea ) * @xcite . tea is made exact by means of stochastic estimates ( set ) in the orthogonal subspace . in fig .",
    "[ fig : set ] we compare the standard set - method ( no mode computed via tea ) on the smeared gauge fields with the improvement through hpa and tea ( 200 modes ) .",
    "[ fig : set ]",
    "[ fig : sba ] shows intermediate results of our ongoing evaluation of t@xmath18l configurations that have been obtained with a preliminary form of the fat link static action .",
    "hence the asymptotic ground state is just slightly higher than twice the heavy - light mass .",
    "the error bars of the zoomed plot are smaller than the symbols .",
    "level - splitting is achieved at the crossing point for the first time in 4-dimensional qcd with dynamical fermions , demonstrating string breaking .",
