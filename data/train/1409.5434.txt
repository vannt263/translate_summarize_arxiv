    "most simulations of galaxy evolution require some kind of feedback that correlates with bulge mass ( and is often assumed to be active galactic nucleus [ agn ] feedback ) to reproduce key observations , such as the colour bimodality of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , the mechanism that funnels gas toward the central supermassive black hole that powers the agn is still unknown ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "major mergers are often cited as a key trigger for agn activity @xcite . although major mergers seem to drive the most luminous and rapidly accreting agn @xcite , low- to moderate - luminosity agn , which make up the majority of agn by number , seem to be fueled by processes that do not visibly disturb the discy structure of galaxies @xcite .    an obvious process that satisfies this constraint is secular evolution @xcite .",
    "a major driver of secular evolution in disc galaxies is large - scale bars , and they are predicted to affect galaxies in a variety of ways , including the fueling of agn @xcite . the non - axisymmetric potential of a bar is predicted to funnel interstellar gas into the central kpc @xcite  which has been confirmed by multiple observational works @xcite  where a possible nested , secondary bar may further funnel gas to the inner @xmath6 pc . from this distance ,",

    "there is also no direct correlation between primary bars and secondary bars , with @xmath7 of all disc galaxies having a secondary bar @xcite .",

    "our conclusions are not sensitive to the exact limits , e.g. , reducing these limits by @xmath67 does not change the conclusions .    with this initial pool of control galaxies ,",
    "we perform a 5-stage matching process that iteratively reduces the pool until it reaches a final set of three unique and matched control galaxies .",
    "the first stage cuts the initial pool of control galaxies to the 15 closest matched galaxies in one of the matching parameters , i.e. , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , or @xmath72 .",
    "each successive stage matches the remaining control galaxies to one of the unused matching parameters and eliminates the three worst matched galaxies .",
    "thus the second stage reduces the pool to 12 , the third stage reduces the pool to 9 , the fourth reduces the pool to 6 , and finally , the fifth stage reduces the pool to 3 .",
    "ultimately , for each survey we have a control sample that contains no duplicates and is three times larger than the agn sample ( see table [ tab : sample_counts ] ) .",
    "this 5-stage matching process was performed for each agn host in our sample .",

    "the agn and control samples that this matching technique produces are affected by the order in which we match the agn hosts to the control galaxies and the order in which the matching parameters are used . in order to adequately sample the parameter space , we repeat this 5-stage matching technique 100 times for each survey , with each iteration randomly shuffling the order of the agn hosts , the order of the control galaxies , and the order of the matching parameters .",
    "ultimately , we generate 100 agn samples and 100 control samples for each survey . for brevity and clarity",
    ", we define an `` agn - control sample '' to be all agn hosts and their corresponding control galaxies for a given survey and for a given matching iteration .",

    "[ fig : agn_controls ] presents stacked histograms of the distribution of parameter differences between the agn hosts and their matched control galaxies .",
    "each panel stacks 100 translucent histograms , with each histogram representing one agn - control sample .",
    "to elaborate , each histogram represents the difference in a parameter between each agn and its three control galaxies for a given realization .",
    "the highly shaded regions represent the most populated parameter space , which are generally centered around 0 with small spreads , as supported by the mean and standard deviation at the upper left of each panel , indicating that our matching technique works well .",
    "moreover , we also calculated the two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) null probability for each pair of agn - control parameter distributions , where small values indicate that the two distributions in question are probably not from the same underlying distribution .",
    "we display the median k - s null probability , p@xmath73 , of all 100 pairs of agn - control distributions in each panel , most of which show high values , indicating that the agn and control samples are consistent .",
    "however , it is clear that the histograms of goods - s are slightly broader and more skewed than those of aegis and cosmos , especially in srsic index and redshift , as supported by p@xmath73 .",
    "the relatively small sample size of goods - s ( see table [ tab : sample_counts ] ) makes it difficult to identify well - matched control galaxies for the goods - s agn hosts .",

    "each set of agn - control galaxies is reassuringly similar in appearance , confirming that our matching technique is reasonable .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although redshift effects ( e.g. , cosmological surface brightness dimming , angular size change , band - shifting ) hinder bar detection , our experiment is a _ relative _ comparison between two matched samples that controls for redshift and several of the most correlated parameters of bar presence ( e.g. , stellar mass , colour , and srsic index ; @xcite ) , so our study naturally takes this bias into account . assuming that there are no agn - dependent selection effects , our experiment should be robust against any known bar detection biases .",
    "as an additional check , we tested for differential redshift effects by splitting our sample into two redshift intervals , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and repeating our analysis .",
    "we chose these @xmath19 intervals because @xcite argued that the ability to detect bars at @xmath76 is hampered by the overlap of the _",

    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , the majority of the light gathered in the _",

    "their results are broadly consistent with ours , with neither a significant bar excess among agn nor an agn excess among barred galaxies at @xmath107 .",
    "however , @xcite do suggest a marginal excess of bars among agn ( compared to non - agn ) at @xmath108 , which we do not detect in our results . this difference is likely due to slight differences in bar identification threshold of 0.5",
    "tends to identify strong bars , meaning that our work concerns mainly strong bars .",
    "the bar fractions used by @xcite are consistent with the total bar fractions of @xcite , meaning that their work concerns both strong and weak bars . ] , or due to the differences in our matching of agn and inactive galaxies .",
    "( our samples are matched in 5 parameters , while @xcite matched agn and inactive galaxies in stellar mass and redshift only .",
    ") however , these are only small differences , and the results of @xcite are consistent with our conclusion that bars do not dominate agn fueling at @xmath109 .    , of the barred ( green squares ) and non - barred control samples ( purple triangles ) for the aegis , cosmos , and goods - s surveys .",
    "the error bars on @xmath110 are the @xmath96 binomial confidence limits .",
    "there is no statistically significant difference in @xmath110 between the barred and non - barred control samples across all three surveys , indicating that there is no statistically significant excess of agn in barred galaxies . ]    however , before ruling out bars as the primary fueling mechanism for supermassive black hole growth , one must ask if the bar  agn connection can be concealed if a bar dissolves while a black hole is still accreting the bar - funneled gas . in the present analysis",
    ", we are assuming that the bar instantaneously funnels gas to the central black hole upon its formation , and moreover , that there is no delay in agn activity .",
    "the typical lifetimes of agn and bars are uncertain . for agn ,",
    "the current estimates range from @xmath111 to @xmath112 years ( @xcite , see hanny s voorwerp in @xcite for an example of an agn with a short lifetime ) . for bars , early simulations of isolated disc galaxies by @xcite indicate that they are short - lived , with a lifetime of 12@xmath113 years .",
    "the latest simulations of isolated disc galaxies by @xcite , however , indicate that bars are long - lived , with a lifetime as long as @xmath114 years .",
    "this latter result is supported by recent zoom - in cosmological simulations by @xcite , who show that bars formed at @xmath115 generally persist down to @xmath3 . despite the uncertainty in both agn and bar lifetimes ,",
    "even the shortest bar lifetime is an order of magnitude larger than the longest agn lifetime , meaning that the bar - agn connection is not likely to be concealed by short bar lifetimes .",
    "small - scale , nuclear bars may also fuel supermassive black hole growth .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to resolve such small structures in our images",
    ". however , work in the local universe shows that nuclear bars are not more frequent in agn hosts compared to non - agn hosts @xcite .",
    "this result mirrors that of large - scale bars , suggesting that nuclear bars do not fuel supermassive black hole growth at @xmath54 either . whether nuclear bars can fuel agn at @xmath53 will be left for future work .",
    "interestingly , studies of the relative angle between agn accretion discs and host galaxy discs are consistent with our interpretation that bars do not fuel agn .",
    "if agn accretion discs are fueled by bar - funneled gas , then one would expect this gas to have an angular momentum vector that is parallel to the bulk of the gaseous disc of the galaxy .",
    "however , it appears that the accretion discs are randomly orientated with respect to their host galaxies @xcite , which fits with our interpretation that bars do not directly fuel agn .",
    "this misalignment could be interpreted even more generally ",
    "there simply may not be a galactic - scale black hole fueling mechanism . instead , a collection of processes , including minor mergers ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cooling flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and multi - body interactions with star clusters or clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may work to transport gas into the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "this process , known as `` stochastic fueling , '' @xcite has been implemented in models that successfully reproduce observations of low to intermediate luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we present a new study on the bar - agn connection beyond the local universe .",
    "we combine _ chandra _ and galaxy zoo : _ hubble _ data in the aegis , cosmos , and goods - s surveys to determine whether agn are preferentially fed by large - scale bars at @xmath2 .    using gzh classifications and galaxy structural measurements , we select non - merging , face - on disc galaxies that have sizes large enough to accurately identify large - scale bars . from this face - on disc sample ,",
    "we identify agn with _ x_-ray luminosities @xmath1 .",
    "we then use a novel multi - parameter technique to construct control samples of non - agn galaxies robustly matched to the agn hosts in stellar mass , rest - frame colour , srsic index , effective radius , and redshift . with these samples",
    ", we find no statistically significant excess of barred galaxies in agn hosts ( and no excess of agn in barred galaxies ) . specifically , we find that the bar fraction of the agn sample can not be greater than twice the bar fraction of the control sample at 99.7% confidence .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that agn are not preferentially nor directly fed via * large - scale * bars at @xmath2 .",
