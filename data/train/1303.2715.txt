    "furthermore , assume @xmath21 is bounded and @xmath348 - convex with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "then the free boundary in the partial transport problem with cost @xmath349 is locally semiconvex .    first , by ( * ?",
    "* remark 2.11 ) , the partial transport exists and classical results imply that it has the form @xmath350 for some @xmath14 - convex function @xmath275 . next , pick a free boundary point @xmath351 . then , for @xmath352 small , @xmath353 may be used as a chart between @xmath354 and the tangent space at @xmath112 . since @xmath346 , @xmath355 thus",
    ", we may use only one chart ( i.e. @xmath356 ) to project @xmath357 onto the tangent space at @xmath112 .",
    "the cut locus assumption also implies that @xmath225 is smooth on @xmath358 , and since @xmath281 , we have that it is bounded away from zero .",
    "thus , the level sets of @xmath14 enjoy a uniform ball condition ( see lemma [ l5 ] ) .",
    "moreover , thanks to the @xmath14 - convexity of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath20 , we may apply theorem [ lip ] to deduce local lipschitz regularity of the free boundary ( note that ( [ eee1 ] ) follows from lemma [ conddd ] which we can apply thanks to our cut locus assumption ) .",
    "the lipschitz regularity combines with the uniform ball property of the level sets and readily yields local semiconvexity of the free boundary .",
    "if @xmath359 , then it may happen that @xmath360 , so the proof above breaks down ( since the distance function is only smooth away from the cut locus ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is currently some literature available in understanding the proper conditions which ensure that this scenario does not happen .",
    "indeed , loeper and villani ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.1 ) shed some light on this issue : given a uniformly regular manifold ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 4.1 ) ) and two densities @xmath361 and @xmath192 such that @xmath362 and @xmath363 for any borel set @xmath364 , there is a @xmath365 depending on @xmath361 and @xmath192 , so that @xmath366 it is well - known that @xmath318 is a uniformly regular manifold ( see ( * ? ? ? * example 4.3 ) ) , so one may hope to utilize loeper and villani s theory to develop a full regularity theory for the partial transport first on the sphere , and then in a more general setting .",
    "we conclude with a family of examples which illustrate that neither the  stay away from the cut locus \" property nor the @xmath14 - convexity of the target with respect to the entire source are necessary conditions for semiconvexity of the free boundary .",
    "in what follows , we outline a method for constructing two general densities @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath367 and @xmath368 so that @xmath21 is not @xmath348 - convex with respect to @xmath20 , yet the free boundary in the partial transport problem is locally semiconvex away from the common region : let @xmath369 and @xmath21 be a small spherical cap centered around the south pole with height , say , @xmath370 ( measured from the south pole ) .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath371 is an annulus ( here , @xmath372 is the north pole ) ; hence , @xmath21 fails to be @xmath349 - convex with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "assume @xmath373 is slightly smaller than @xmath374 ( to ensure the existence of a free boundary ) , and the mass @xmath8 transported is slightly larger than @xmath373 .",
    "now , enlarge @xmath21 to a bigger spherical cap @xmath375 with height @xmath376 so that @xmath377 , where @xmath378 is a small positive constant ( this can be accomplished by adjusting @xmath6 and @xmath7 at the beginning ) .",
    "then , it can be shown that the spherical cap @xmath379 centered at the north pole with height @xmath370 ( measured from the north pole ) is outside the active region : if not , suppose @xmath380 , and choose a subset @xmath381 of @xmath382 so that @xmath383 ; then choose a subset @xmath384 of @xmath385 so that @xmath386 . in the original partial transport plan ,",
    "@xmath381 is transported to @xmath387 and it is easy to see that the distance between @xmath381 and @xmath388 is bigger than @xmath389 .",
    "now we modify the original plan by replacing the mass in @xmath381 by the mass in @xmath384 , and from @xmath384 to @xmath388 , we can cook up a new transport map thanks to the mass balance condition .",
    "next , let @xmath390 be the largest distance on @xmath375 , and note @xmath391 thus , @xmath392 .",
    "therefore , it is not difficult to see the new plan is cheaper than the original , contradicting optimality . thus , the original partial transport problem is equivalent to a new one with source @xmath393 and target @xmath21 ; in the new problem we do not have a cut locus issue  this ensures an interior ball condition ; moreover , it is not difficult to see that if @xmath112 is a free boundary point away from the common region , @xmath394 is contained in a cone on the tangent space with vertex at @xmath112 whose opening is strictly less than @xmath50",
    ". thus , we may proceed as in the proof of theorem [ rsemi ] to obtain local semiconvexity of the free boundary away from the common region .    *",
