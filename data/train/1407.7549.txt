    "in his general theory of relativity , albert einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves ( gws ) @xcite  ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by asymmetries in catastrophic and highly accelerated events throughout the cosmos .",
    "though confirmed indirectly by observations of the binary pulsar psr @xmath2 @xcite , gws have not been directly detected by the global network of first generation detectors , such as initial ligo in the united states @xcite , virgo in italy @xcite , geo 600 in germany @xcite , and tama 300 in japan @xcite .",
    "the second generation of ligo detectors , advanced ligo  @xcite , are currently under construction and will likely operate as early as 2015  @xcite .",
    "advanced virgo  @xcite should come on - line in 2016 , while the japanese kagra  @xcite detector will join the world - wide network later in the decade .",
    "the ten - fold improvement in sensitivity of these detectors @xcite , along with coherent analysis between observatories , will significantly improve the chances of detecting gws from an astrophysical event in the milky way and neighbouring galaxies .",
    "it is therefore likely that direct detection of gws will occur in the near future .",
    "potential sources of gws include the inspiral of compact binary star systems ( of neutron stars or black holes ) followed by black hole formation @xcite , pulsars @xcite , rotating core collapse supernovae ( ccsn ) followed by protoneutron star formation @xcite , gamma - ray bursts @xcite , and cosmic string cusps @xcite",
    ".    rotating ccsn are of particular interest in this paper . like neutrinos ,",
    "gws are emitted deep in the core of a progenitor and propagate through the universe mostly unobscured by astrophysical objects between the source and a detector on earth .",
    "gws act like messengers , providing primary observables about the multi - dimensional core collapse dynamics and emission mechanisms .",
    "it is in this way that gw astronomy will open a new set of eyes to view the universe , complementing the conventional electromagnetic - type observations .    coalescing binary star systems are the most promising source of detectable gws @xcite , with an expected observation rate that could be as large as a few hundred events per year for advanced ligo @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the expected rate of ccsn in the milky way is around three per century @xcite .",
    "it is of great importance that appropriate data analysis techniques are in place so we do not miss an opportunity to detect these rare ccsn events .",
    "the bayesian statistical framework has proven to be a powerful tool for parameter estimation in astrophysical and cosmological settings @xcite .",
    "bayesian data analysis was first introduced to the gw community by christensen and meyer @xcite .",
    "christensen and meyer @xcite then demonstrated the usefulness of the gibbs sampler @xcite for estimating five physical parameters of coalescing binary signals .",
    "christensen , meyer , and libson @xcite then went on to show how a custom - built metropolis - hastings algorithm @xcite , a generalization of the gibbs sampler , was a superior and more suited routine for eventual implementation into the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) algorithm library ( lal ) .",
    "parameter estimation for compact binary inspirals has subsequently become more sophisticated in recent years ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) routines for inferring the physical parameters of pulsars have also been developed @xcite .",
    "due to the analytical intractability and complex multi - dimensional nature of rotating core collapse stellar events , a significant amount of computational time must go into numerically simulating the gravitational waveforms . unlike binary inspiral events , one can not simply use template search methods for supernova burst events as it is computationally impossible to cover the entire signal parameter space .",
    "it is therefore important to find alternative parameter estimation techniques .",
    "summerscales @xcite utilized the maximum entropy framework to deconvolve noisy data from multiple ( coherent ) detectors , with the goal of extracting a ccsn gw signal .",
    "inference on amplitude and phase parameters was conducted using cross correlation between the recovered waveform and the set of competing waveforms from the ott @xcite catalogue .",
    "a match was defined as the model with the maximum cross correlation to the recovered waveform .",
    "heng @xcite first proposed a principal component analysis ( pca ) approach to simplify the problem by reducing a given supernova waveform catalogue space down to a small number of basis vectors .",
    "rver @xcite extended this approach and created a novel metropolis - within - gibbs sampler @xcite to reconstruct test signals from the dimmelmeier catalogue @xcite in noisy data using a principal component regression ( pcr ) model with random effects and unknown signal arrival time .",
    "they then attempted to exploit the structure of the posterior principal component ( pc ) coefficients with a simple @xmath3 measure of distance to determine which catalogue waveform best matched the injected test signal .",
    "although the bayesian reconstruction method showed much promise , extraction of the underlying physical parameters had limited success .",
    "logue @xcite used nested sampling @xcite to compute bayesian evidence for pcr models under three competing supernova mechanisms  neutrino , magnetorotational , and acoustic mechanisms .",
    "each supernova mechanism has a noticeably distinct gravitational waveform morphology , and the method was successful at correctly inferring a large majority of injected signals .",
    "they found that for signals embedded in simulated advanced ligo noise , the magnetorotational mechanism could be distinguished to a distance of up to 10 kpc , and the neutrino and acoustic mechanisms up to 2 kpc .",
    "abdikamalov @xcite generated a new ccsn waveform catalogue and applied matched filtering @xcite to infer total angular momentum to within @xmath4 for rapidly rotating cores .",
    "slowly rotating cores had errors up to @xmath5 . along with",
    "matched filtering , they employed the bayesian model selection method presented in @xcite to illustrate that under certain assumptions of the rotation law , the next generation of gw detectors ( advanced ligo , advanced virgo , and kagra ) , could also extract information about the degree of precollapse differential rotation .",
    "the two methods worked particularly well for rapidly rotating cores .    in this paper",
    "we present an alternative approach to parameter estimation for rotating ccsn . using the abdikamalov catalogue @xcite ,",
    "we fit a bayesian pcr model to reconstruct a gw signal in noisy data .",
    "initially , the signal arrival time is assumed to be known , and pc coefficients are sampled directly from the posterior distribution .",
    "we extend the model to incorporate an unknown signal arrival time and construct a metropolis - within - gibbs mcmc sampler ( as done in @xcite ) .",
    "we then use the posterior means of the pc coefficients to fit the known physical parameters on ( using a linear model ) , and sample from the posterior predictive distribution to make probabilistic statements about the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational energy of the inner core at bounce @xmath6 .",
    "we apply two supervised learning algorithms  nave bayes classifier ( nbc ) and @xmath7-nearest neighbour ( @xmath7-nn )  to classify the closest level of precollapse differential rotation @xmath8 .",
    "we also introduce a constrained optimization approach to model selection and attempt to find an optimal number of pcs for the bayesian pcr model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the simulated gw data catalogue used in our analysis ; section 3 introduces the statistical models and methods applied ; results of our analysis are presented in section 4 ; and a discussion of our findings and future directions are provided in section 5 .",
    "the waveforms used in this paper are the two - dimensional numerical axisymmetric general - relativistic hydrodynamic rotating core collapse and bounce supernova simulations generated by abdikamalov @xcite . based on findings that gw signals are essentially independent of the progenitor zero age main sequence ( zams ) mass by ott @xcite , a single presupernova progenitor model ( the 12-@xmath9 at zams solar - metallicity progenitor model from @xcite )",
    "was adopted .",
    "the cylindrical rotation law from @xcite was also assumed .",
    "the gw catalogue was partitioned into a base catalogue ( bc ) , and a test catalogue ( tc ) .",
    "the bc contains @xmath10 signals with five levels of precollapse differential rotation @xmath8 ( where higher values of @xmath8 represent weaker differential rotation ) , a grid of values for initial central angular velocity @xmath11 , and a grid of values for the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational energy of the inner core at bounce @xmath6 ( since @xmath6 is a function of @xmath11 for a fixed progenitor structure ) .",
    "each signal in the bc was generated using the microphysical finite - temperature lattimer - swesty ( ls ) equation of state ( eos ) @xcite , parametrized deleptonization scheme from @xcite , and neutrino leakage scheme from @xcite .",
    "as well as varying @xmath8 , @xmath11 , and @xmath6 , the tc contains 47 signals with differing eos and deleptonization parametrizations @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , some test signals were generated using the shen eos @xcite , or an increase / decrease in @xmath12 parametrization by @xmath13 .",
    "the values of @xmath11 and @xmath6 in the tc are in the same parameter space as those in the bc , but with an alternative grid .",
    "the object of our analysis is to predict the physical parameters ( @xmath6 and @xmath8 ) of the signals in the tc using information gleaned about signals in the bc .",
    "the signals were initially sampled at 100 khz and subsequently downsampled by a rational factor to 16384 hz  the sampling rate of the advanced ligo detectors .",
    "downsampling by a rational factor essentially involved two steps : upsampling by an integer factor via interpolation and then applying a low - pass filter to eliminate the high frequency components necessary to avoid aliasing at lower sampling rates ; and downsampling by an integer factor to achieve the desired sampling rate @xcite .",
    "the resampled data was zero - bufferred to ensure each signal was the same length , @xmath14 , which corresponded to 1 s of data at the advanced ligo sampling rate .",
    "each signal was then aligned so that the first negative peak ( not necessarily the global minimum ) , corresponding to the time of core bounce , occurred halfway through the time series .    in this analysis ,",
    "the source of a gw emission is assumed to be optimally oriented ( perpendicular ) to a single interferometer .",
    "each signal is linearly polarized with zero cross - polarization .",
    "[ fig : gw ]    we can see a general waveform morphology in figure  [ fig : gw ] . during core collapse , there is a slow increase in gw strain until the first local maximum is reached ( before 0.5 s ) .",
    "this is followed by core bounce , where the strain rapidly decreases towards a local minimum ( at 0.5 s ) .",
    "this corresponds to the time when the inner core expands at bounce .",
    "after this , there is a period of ring - down oscillations .",
    "for slowly rotating progenitors , we see in the top panel of figure  [ fig : gw ] that the gw strain is essentially the same during collapse and bounce and only differs during ring - down . for the rapidly rotating progenitors presented in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : gw ] , larger precollapse differential rotation results in : a smaller local maximum during core collapse ; a more negative local minimum during core bounce ; and a larger first ring - down peak .",
    "because of these patterns , abdikamalov @xcite concluded that inferences about precollapse differential rotation could in principal be made for rapidly rotating cores .",
    "the data analyzed are ccsn gw signals injected in coloured gaussian noise using the advanced ligo noise curve with one - sided power spectral density ( psd ) , @xmath15 .",
    "the data is then tukey windowed to mitigate spectral leakage . rather than fixing source distance to 10 kpc ( as done in @xcite ) , this analysis assumes a fixed signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath16 .",
    "snr is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 , are the fourier transformed data , @xmath19 is the distance between two consecutive time points , and @xmath20 , are the fourier frequencies . as done in @xcite , @xmath15 is estimated _ a priori _ by averaging 1000 empirical periodograms from identically simulated advanced ligo noise .",
    "this corresponds to a realistic scenario where the noise spectrum must be estimated as well .",
    "although supernovae from the milky way will not produce snrs as small as @xmath16 , we choose this value to illustrate that our methods are robust at lower snrs .",
    "bayesian inference requires three pivotal quantities . the _ likelihood _ function @xmath21 is the probability density function ( pdf ) of the data @xmath22 , conditional on the random vector of model parameters @xmath23 .",
    "the _ prior _",
    "@xmath24 is the pdf of the model parameters , that takes into account all of the information known about @xmath23 before the data is observed .",
    "the _ posterior _",
    "@xmath25 is the updated pdf of model parameters after the data is observed .",
    "these quantities are related via bayes theorem @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the _ marginal likelihood _ and is treated as a normalizing constant since it is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "that is , the posterior is proportional to the prior multiplied by the likelihood .",
    "posterior sampling can be performed directly if the posterior pdf has a closed analytical form .",
    "otherwise , mcmc techniques are a useful work - around .",
    "the key building blocks in mcmc simulations are the gibbs sampler @xcite and the metropolis - hastings algorithm @xcite .",
    "we use a combination of the two  the so - called metropolis - within - gibbs sampler  in this study . for",
    "a detailed account of bayesian inference and mcmc algorithms , refer to @xcite .",
    "we aim to first reduce the dimension of the bc by a pca , or equivalently a singular value decomposition ( svd ) as suggested by heng @xcite .",
    "each bc waveform is represented as a linear combination of orthonormal basis vectors , where the projection of the data onto the first basis vector has maximum variance , the projection onto the second basis vector has second highest variance , and so on . by considering only projections on the first @xmath28 basis vectors , the so - called @xmath29 pcs , a parsimonious representation of the catalogue signals in @xmath29 dimensions",
    "is achieved that preserves as much of the information of the original bc as possible .",
    "once pca is conducted , the first @xmath29 pcs are treated as the explanatory variables of a linear model .",
    "the data analyzed is a time series vector @xmath30 of length @xmath31 and decomposes into additive signal and noise components .",
    "let @xmath32 be the fourier transformed data vector of length @xmath31 and let @xmath33 be the @xmath34 design matrix , whose columns are the fourier transformed mean - centered pc vectors from the bc .",
    "the frequency domain linear model is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the vector of pcr coefficients and @xmath37 is the fourier transformed coloured zero - mean gaussian noise vector whose variance terms are proportional to the _ a priori known _",
    "one - sided power spectral density @xmath15 . that is , @xmath38 due to hermitian symmetry",
    ", the frequency domain data vector @xmath32 contains only the non - redundant real and imaginary components and is therefore the same length as the time domain vector @xmath30 .",
    "conversion between time and frequency domains is conducted using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "the likelihood for the bayesian pcr model with known signal arrival time is @xmath39 assuming flat ( @xmath40 ) priors on @xmath36 , the posterior distribution for the pc coefficients is @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the diagonal covariance matrix of individual variances for the noise component .",
    "this multivariate normal distribution can be sampled directly with no mcmc required .",
    "noninformative priors were chosen for this model .",
    "it was important to keep the data and prior knowledge separate and distinct , and to avoid using information from the waveform catalogue for both purposes . as the only data available for analysis were the generated gws , we assumed complete prior ignorance on all model parameters .      the bayesian pcr model presented in the previous section assumed a known signal arrival time",
    ". the precise arrival time of a gw signal to an interferometer will generally not be known in practice , and must therefore be included as an additional unknown parameter in the statistical model .",
    "let @xmath44 be a cyclical time shift representing the unknown signal arrival time , and let @xmath45 be the fourier transformed design matrix @xmath33 shifted by lag @xmath44 , such that the fourier transformed pcs are aligned with the fourier transformed data vector , @xmath32 .",
    "this transformation can be done directly in the frequency domain as a phase shift by multiplying the columns of @xmath33 by @xmath46 .",
    "we build on the bayesian signal reconstruction model presented in @xcite , although our primary goal is inferring the physical parameters of a supernova progenitor and not signal reconstruction .    using the same reasoning described in the previous section , we assume flat priors on @xmath36 and @xmath44 .",
    "the likelihood for the bayesian pcr model with unknown signal arrival time is @xmath47 for a given time shift @xmath44 , the conditional posterior distribution for the pc coefficients @xmath48 is @xmath49 where @xmath50 to estimate @xmath36 and @xmath44 , we construct a markov chain whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of interest using metropolis - within - gibbs sampler @xcite .",
    "this is essentially a gibbs sampler that alternates between the full set of conditional posterior distributions @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the former can be sampled directly using equation  ( [ eq : condpost2 ] ) , and the latter requires a random walk metropolis step , hence the name metropolis - within - gibbs .",
    "after initialization , step @xmath53 in the metropolis - within - gibbs algorithm is :    1 .   directly sample the conditional posterior of @xmath54 using equation  ( [ eq : condpost2 ] ) ; 2 .",

    "it has a similar ( symmetrical ) shape to the normal distribution but has heavier tails and an additional degrees - of - freedom parameter , @xmath61 .",
    "the heavier tails of the @xmath60-distribution results in bolder and more robust proposals than the normal distribution , ensuring the algorithm does not get stuck in local modes @xcite .",

    "the proposal for @xmath63 is centered on @xmath64 , and has scale parameter @xmath65 that is initially and arbitrarily set to 0.05 , and subsequently automatically tuned during the algorithm to ensure good mixing and acceptance rates .      for each of the @xmath10 signals in the bc and @xmath66 signals in the tc",
    ", we fit both bayesian pcr models , with @xmath29 pcs ( where the choice of @xmath29 is explained below ) .",
    "we then construct an @xmath67 design matrix @xmath68 whose rows are the _ posterior means _ of the @xmath29 pc coefficients , plus an intercept term , for each of the @xmath69 signals in the bc .",
    "the primary goal is to exploit the posterior pc coefficient space to make inferences on the physical parameters of rotating core collapse stellar events in the tc .",
    "we accomplish this by fitting a linear model with the known physical parameters from the bc as the response variable on the design matrix @xmath68 using @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the vector of known continuous physical parameters , @xmath72 is the vector of regression coefficients , and @xmath73 is an error term .",
    "the error term is assumed to come from an independent and identically distributed normal distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath74 .",
    "predictions using the _ posterior predictive distribution _ are the primary interest in this analysis , and not the model parameters themselves .    assuming the convenient noninformative prior distribution that is uniform on @xmath75 , the posterior predictive distribution for a normal linear model is a multivariate @xmath60-distribution and can be sampled from directly with no mcmc @xcite .",
    "the formula is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the vector of outcomes we wish to predict ( i.e. , the physical parameters from signals in the tc ) , @xmath78 is the @xmath79 matrix whose rows are the posterior means of the signals in the tc ( and an intercept term ) from the bayesian pcr step , @xmath80 is the @xmath81 identity matrix , and @xmath82      the _ deviance _ is defined as @xmath83 where @xmath21 is the likelihood of a statistical model , and @xmath23 is the vector of model parameters .",
    "the _ deviance information criterion _ ( dic ) is a bayesian model comparison technique and a generalization of akaike information criterion ( aic ) for hierarchical models @xcite .",
    "dic is defined as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the mean deviance from posterior samples , @xmath86 is the effective number of parameters , and @xmath87 is the deviance evaluated at the posterior means of the parameters . when comparing competing statistical models , the lowest dic is preferred .",
    "@xmath85 is a measure of fit , and @xmath86 is a measure of model complexity used to penalize models with too many parameters .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : dic1 ] ) therefore illustrates how dic incorporates occam s razor , allowing one to select a parsimonious model , balancing between fit and complexity .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : dic2 ] ) , on the other hand , provides a simple method for computing dic .",
    "@xmath85 is calculated by evaluating the deviance for each of the stored model parameters @xmath23 that have been sampled from their joint posterior pdf , and then taking the average .",
    "@xmath87 is calculated by finding the posterior mean of each of the model parameters @xmath88 and then evaluating the deviance .",
    "dic is the preferred model comparison technique in this analysis .",
    "a popular alternative , bayes factors , would require computing the marginal likelihood from equation  ( [ eq : bayes ] ) , which involves multi - dimensional integration over a large number of parameters . numerical techniques such as nested sampling @xcite can be used to derive the marginal likelihood but these methods require significant computational time and power . on the other hand , dic is easily computed from posterior samples .",
    "another benefit of using dic over bayes factors is that improper priors ( which we have assumed in this analysis ) do not violate any conditions of use .",
    "bayes factors , on the other hand , are no longer applicable when improper priors are used .    the choice of the number of pcs has been arbitrary in most of the supernova gw parameter estimation literature and this number has usually been @xmath89 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we propose a method for selecting the optimal choice of @xmath29 based on careful analysis of the dic for competing models and constrained optimization .",
    "since pcs are ordered by the total amount of variation they make up in the data set , pca provides a convenient ordering system for nested modelling .",
    "let @xmath90 , represent the set of possible pcr models , where @xmath29 is the number of explanatory variables .",
    "the models are nested such that @xmath91 has one explanatory variable ( pc1 ) , @xmath92 has two explanatory variables ( pc1 and pc2 ) , and so on .    for each of the @xmath10 signals in the bc ( injected in advanced ligo noise ) ,",
    "all of the models @xmath93 , are fitted and then compared using dic . the model with the lowest dic is the best fit to the data .",
    "however , models with an absolute difference in dic of @xmath94 are generally taken to be indistinguishable from one another @xcite and so to prevent over - fitting , we propose a constrained optimization routine , where we select the smallest @xmath29 such that the difference in dic between @xmath95 and the model with the minimum dic is less than 5 .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath96 be the model with the minimum dic , then find @xmath29 such that @xmath97    we employ this routine for each of the @xmath10 bc signals , and look at the distribution of @xmath95 s over all signals .",
    "the median of this distribution seems a prudent choice for a general - purpose number of pcs since these distributions tend to be skewed .",
    "it is important to note here that we can not choose a different value for @xmath29 for each signal when implementing these models as this would lead to a very sparse design matrix @xmath68 when sampling from the posterior predictive distribution .",
    "we refer the reader to figure  [ fig : occam ] in the results section of this paper for an example of this method in action .",
    "the nbc @xcite is a common supervised learning algorithm and discriminant method used to group objects into a discrete set of classes based on a set of features .",
    "the algorithm requires a _ training set _ of objects with known groupings and observed features .",
    "once the algorithm has learnt from the training set , each object in a _ test set _ ( containing a set of observed features and potentially unknown classes )",
    "is assigned to the group that it has the highest probability of belonging to .",
    "the `` bayes '' component of the method refers to bayes theorem @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the class that an object could belong to , and @xmath100 are the features we wish to exploit to classify the object .",
    "that is , given some observed features @xmath100 , what is the posterior probability of an object belonging to class @xmath101 ?",
    "the `` nave '' component refers to the assumption of conditional independence of the model features @xmath102 .",
    "this assumption implies the joint pdf @xmath103 can be factorized as the product of marginal distributions @xmath104 and so equation  ( [ eq : naive ] ) becomes @xmath105 given class @xmath101 , each feature @xmath106 is assumed to be independently normally distributed .",
    "the model parameters are approximated using the relative frequencies from the training set .",
    "the class prior probabilities @xmath107 are specified as the number of objects in class @xmath101 in the training set divided by the total number of objects .",
    "objects are grouped into the class that yields the highest posterior probability .",

    "an alternative machine learning algorithm to the nbc is the @xmath7-nn @xcite , which uses a measure of `` closeness '' between objects rather than a probabilistic framework .",
    "we choose @xmath108 , meaning that an object in the test set is assigned to the class of its single nearest neighbour in the training set .",
    "ties in distance are settled at random .",
    "the definition of closeness in this context depends on the choice of metric .",
    "as commonly used in the literature @xcite , a euclidean distance is assumed .",
    "for any object with features @xmath109 in the test set , the @xmath7-nn algorithm finds the object with features @xmath110 in the training set that minimizes the euclidean distance @xmath111 and then assigns @xmath100 to the class of @xmath112 .",
    "an important statistical task is to select a prudent number of model dimensions whilst incorporating occam s razor into the decision making process .",
    "more specifically , one needs to balance model fit against complexity to ensure there is no over - fitting . in the context of pca , the decision is usually made based on the amount of variation the first @xmath29 pcs contribute to the data set ( i.e. , analyzing scree plots ) .",
    "this approach is arbitrary and deals specifically with dimension reduction , but not occam s razor .",
    "we propose an alternative approach , involving dic and constrained optimization .",

    "this is the typical shape of the dic curve for all signals in the bc and a good visual aid of occam s razor in action .",
    "there tends to be a sharp decrease in dic as the model dimension increases at the beginning , where model fit is improving .",
    "dic flattens out and then reaches a minimum , where there is the best balance between fit against complexity .",
    "after this , there is a slow rise in dic as the model dimension increases and becomes too complex .",

    "signal 27 ( @xmath119 from the catalogue ) is an outlier and comes from a slowly rotating core with uniform rotation .",
    "it is likely an outlier due to the strong stochastic components in the gw signal from prompt postbounce convection @xcite .",

    "the credible intervals are relatively small , at approximately four units ( times @xmath124 ) long .",
    "this means that it is particularly easy to distinguish @xmath6 between gw signals .",
    "the length of credible interval widens by a factor of @xmath125 when changing from known to unknown signal arrival time . incorporating an unknown time shift increases the uncertainty of the pc coefficients since the mcmc algorithm draws @xmath48 .",

    "however , predictions are still accurate in most cases .",
    "we see in figure  [ fig : betaunknownt ] , that signal 27 ( @xmath119 ) is an outlier again .",
    "signal 23 ( @xmath123 ) is another outlier with credible interval on the negative side of the number line .",
    "this is an absurd and physically impossible range for a strictly positive variable , and is a consequence of the fact that the priors can only constrain the linear model parameters @xmath126 .",
    "more specifically , we could not put priors on the response variable of physical parameters @xmath71 to constrain the predicted physical parameters @xmath77 .",
    "a similarity that this signal has with the other outlier is that it comes from a slowly rotating core with weak differential rotation .",
    "our methods work reasonably well when varying the eos and deleptonization parametrization , although we underestimate some signals with moderate rotation in figure  [ fig : betaknownt_other ] .",
    "three of these signals come from an increase of @xmath12 parametrization , one from a decrease of @xmath12 parametrization , and two from the shen eos . when incorporating an unknown time shift in figure  [ fig : betaunknownt_other ]",
    ", the uncertainty of @xmath44 increases and covers the true parameters .",
    "the increase in the width of credible interval makes it more difficult to distinguish @xmath6 between signals .",
    "we can conclude that the methods employed in this study are moderately sensitive to uncertainties in @xmath12 and eos .",
    "it was found that a gw signal has relatively weak dependence on the nuclear eos by @xcite .",
    "we showed in an unpublished study @xcite that we could correctly identify between the ls and shen eos for 50% of the signals in the dimmelmeier @xcite waveform catalogue using model comparison techniques .",
    "note that 21% were incorrectly identified and 29% unidentified .",
    "it could therefore be useful to incorporate eos as an additional unknown that we wish to infer in future statistical analyses .",
    "the results presented assume a snr of @xmath16 . to test robustness , we trialled the analysis on snrs of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which are more realistic levels for detecting ccsn events in the milky way .",
    "our predictions and credible intervals of @xmath6 were the same , regardless of the snr .",
    "this can be attributed to using only the posterior means of the pc coefficients in constructing design matrix @xmath68 , and not the full spread of the posterior distributions .",
    "this therefore removes uncertainty due to ligo noise and signal reconstruction when predicting @xmath6 from the posterior predictive distribution .",
    "precollapse differential rotation is treated as a categorical variable with five different levels in this analysis .",
    "we define the set of classes @xmath129 and apply the nbc and @xmath7-nn supervised learning algorithms to extract precollapse differential rotation from each of the signals in the tc .",
    "the model features @xmath100 are the posterior means of the pc coefficients from the bayesian pcr models ( @xmath130 for the training set and @xmath131 for the test set ) .",

    "we compare how the methods work when using @xmath130 and @xmath131 from data with known and unknown signal arrival times .    the results between models with known and unknown signal arrival times are quite similar .",
    "the standard gws from class @xmath118 are discriminated well by both algorithms .",
    "the decrease ( and to some degree , the increase ) in @xmath12 parametrization did not affect the algorithms abilities to discriminate . both algorithms performed particularly poorly for the shen eos test signals , which illustrates that @xmath8 is sensitive to the eos .",
    "this is in line with the findings from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7-nn generally performs better than the nbc for gw signals with weak to moderate differential rotation ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "this could be attributed to our choice in prior classes for the nb method .",
    "since models with stronger differential rotation are more populated in the bc , they have a higher prior probability than those with weaker differential rotation .",
    "we have presented a bayesian framework for inferring the physical parameters of ccsn from gw data . we have shown that with a snr of @xmath16 and optimal orientation of detector to source , we can extract @xmath6 with reasonable levels of uncertainty for the majority of injected test signals . both of the bayesian pcr models presented in this paper worked well .",
    "the level of uncertainty increased when incorporating an unknown signal arrival time into the model , but this is no surprise as pc coefficients are conditioned on the signal arrival time for that model .",
    "further , we found that our methods were moderately sensitive to varying eos and @xmath12 parametrizations , and predictions are generally good .",
    "the chosen measure of uncertainty in this analysis was the 90% credible interval .",
    "a great benefit of the bayesian framework is the probabilistic interpretation of credible intervals , enabling one to make statements such as , `` with probability 0.9 , @xmath6 is between @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "''    a true strength of the methods presented in this paper is their generality .",
    "we initially applied these techniques to the dimmelmeier catalogue @xcite as a proof of concept and then easily transferred to the abdikamalov catalogue @xcite . in this study we sampled @xmath6 from its posterior predictive distribution .",
    "this method could however be conducted on any continuous variable of physical interest . although not presented here , predictions of the initial central angular velocity @xmath11 were comparable to what we found with @xmath6 .",
    "choosing to only use the posterior means of the pc coefficients @xmath130 in the construction of the design matrix @xmath68 removed some of the variability due to ligo noise and signal reconstruction .",
    "the uncertainty from the bayesian pcr modelling step therefore does not flow onto the posterior predictive sampling step .",
    "a more realistic case would be to incorporate this uncertainty through an errors - in - variables model , which is commonly used when there are measurement errors in the explanatory variables of a regression model .",
    "we plan to explore this in a future study .",
    "however , a benefit of our method was that predictions were essentially independent of snr ( at least for @xmath141 ) .",
    "an important task in bayesian analysis is specifying the prior pdf to describe our beliefs about model parameters before observing the data .",
    "we wanted to avoid using information from the waveform catalogue as both data and prior knowledge .",
    "it is in this light that we believe the waveform catalogue should be used only as data , and assume complete prior ignorance on all of the model parameters .",
    "we applied the nbc and @xmath7-nn algorithm to extract precollapse differential rotation .",
    "we found that results were comparable between known and unknown signal arrival times .",
    "the @xmath7-nn algorithm generally performed better than the nbc under the assumptions made . in future work",
    ", we plan to investigate how the choice of prior for the nbc affects classification , as well as exploring different metrics such as the mahalanobis distance ( which takes correlations of the data into account ) for the @xmath7-nn .",
    "we are also investigating an alternative classification routine , bayesian ordinal probit regression .",
    "we introduced a constrained optimization approach to model selection that allowed us to select an appropriate number of pcs for the bayesian pcr models .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first attempt at doing so .",
    "techniques such as reversible jump mcmc ( rjmcmc ) @xcite have been utilized in gw data analysis contexts @xcite .",
    "rjmcmc could prove to be a useful and more sophisticated approach than the method presented in the current study .",
    "although our method required a lot of parallel computing , we found it to be a novel solution to the model selection problem .",
    "our analysis assumed optimal orientation of a gw source to a single interferometer .",
    "as presented in @xcite for compact binary inspiral signals , we plan to extend the methods presented in this study to a network of detectors .",
    "this is an important generalization as one can triangulate the position of a gw source using coherent data from multiple detectors .",
