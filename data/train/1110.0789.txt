    "when the domain size is large as compared to the average displacements , the walker dynamics is usually modelled by either regular brownian motion for homogenous media , or anomalous diffusion for heterogeneous , scale - invariant media  @xcite . for markovian transport processes , a systematic approach to assessing the residence time distribution exists , via the so - called feynman - kac formalism  @xcite .",
    "yet , full knowledge of the residence time distribution is an awkward task , and is achievable only in a limited number of cases  @xcite , so that one has often to be content with the first few moments of the residence time  @xcite .",

    "the stochastic path can be thought of as a series of straight - line flights , separated by random collisions , and a natural variable for describing the walker evolution is therefore the number of collisions @xmath3 within the observed volume .",

    "<S> for a broad class of random walks with anisotropic scattering kernel and absorption , we derive explicit formulas that allow expressing the moments of the collision number @xmath0 performed in a volume @xmath1 as a function of the particle equilibrium distribution . </S>",
    "<S> our results apply to arbitrary domains @xmath1 and boundary conditions , and allow assessing the hitting statistics for systems where the typical displacements are comparable to the domain size , so that the diffusion limit is possibly not attained . </S>",
    "<S> an example is discussed for one - dimensional ( @xmath2 ) random flights with exponential displacements , where analytical calculations can be carried out . </S>"
