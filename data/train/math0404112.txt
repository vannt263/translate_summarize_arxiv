    "in many problems one is led to consider in the euclidean plane lines joining a fixed point @xmath18 ( which is not necessarily an integer lattice point ) with a set of integer lattice points .",
    "a natural way of measuring the distribution of directions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , is via correlations and consecutive spacings .",
    "when the fixed point is the origin , the problem is related to the distribution of farey fractions with multiplicities , each fraction @xmath21 in @xmath22 being counted @xmath23 $ ] times .",
    "the consecutive @xmath24-level spacing measures of customary farey fractions were computed for @xmath25 in @xcite and for @xmath26 in @xcite . limiting correlations of farey fractions",
    "were shown to exist and computed recently in @xcite .    when the fixed point is not an integer lattice point , the problem of existence of limiting correlations / consecutive spacings is considerably more difficult .",
    "it is therefore natural to try to prove first some averaging results , letting the fixed point to vary in a given region . in the first part of this paper",
    "we derive such a result for the limiting pair correlation measure .",
    "the limiting average pair correlation function is constant , as in the poisson case .",
    "what is striking however is that this constant is not @xmath27 , as in the poisson case , but @xmath28 .",
    "we now give a mathematical formulation of the problem . for each @xmath29 , let @xmath30 denote the set of integer lattice points in the square @xmath6 ^ 2 $ ] , and set @xmath31 . for each point @xmath32 , we consider the finite sequences @xmath33 , @xmath34 large integer , of angles between the line @xmath2 and the horizontal direction .",
    "the pair correlation of this finite sequence is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the measure of the angle @xmath37 .    throughout the paper",
    "we shall consider a fixed disc @xmath9 of center @xmath38 and radius @xmath39 .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the average @xmath40 of @xmath41 over @xmath9 , for fixed @xmath42 and @xmath10 .",
    "the first three sections are concerned with the proof of the following result .",
    "[ t1.1 ] for every @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45    if one replaces @xmath9 by a vertical or horizontal segment of length one , an identical asymptotic formula as in turns out to be true .",
    "this can be proved by similar techniques as in this paper or using erd \" os - tur ' an type discrepancy estimates , and suggests that may be true regardless of the shape of the range of the fixed point .",
    "the behavior of higher level correlations appears to be different . in the last section",
    "we prove that the @xmath15-level correlations diverge for every fixed point .",
    "when @xmath46 , the repartition of the @xmath1-level correlation measure of the finite sequence @xmath47 is defined for each vector @xmath48 by @xmath49    for randomly chosen directions one would expect to obtain the poissonian limit @xmath50 = 2^{\\nu-1 } \\lambda_1 \\dots",

    "more precisely , we will show that if @xmath51 , then for every point @xmath14 and for every @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",

    "the phenomenon is similar to the one encountered in the problem of the distribution of fractional parts of polynomials .",
    "there , one can handle the pair correlation problem generically ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in the case of the sequence @xmath62 one is able to solve the problem for all @xmath63-level correlations for a large class of irrational numbers @xmath64 ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , there are irrational numbers @xmath64 for which the @xmath65-level correlation of fractional parts of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , diverges to infinity as @xmath68 .",
    "this occurs as a result of the presence of large clusters of such fractional parts . in the case of theorem [ t1.2 ] above",
    ", large clusters of elements of the given sequence are responsible , too , for the divergence of the @xmath15-level correlations , and hence of any other higher level correlations .",
    "for obvious practical reasons , we try to replace from the beginning @xmath70 by one of its trigonometric functions in the definition of @xmath71 .",
    "suppose that two distinct points @xmath72 , @xmath73 , are such that @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
