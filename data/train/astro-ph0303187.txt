    "the hi  properties , tidal features and star formation rates in interacting galaxies are important to study because they reveal how various components of the ism evolve under the forces of gravity .",
    "compact groups of galaxies are particularly interesting because they often display a multitude of tidal features , which outline their interaction history , as well as high star formation rates .",
    "a prominent example is stephen s quintet ( actually a galaxy quartet plus one foreground galaxy ) which contains an hi  mass of @xmath4m@xmath1  located in several hi  clouds and large tidal tails which are clearly displaced from the disks of the four interacting galaxies ( williams , yun & verdes - montenegro 2002 ) .",
    "the ngc  6845 quartet , which is the focus of this paper , is similar to stephen s quintet in terms of distance , angular size , number of group members and hi  mass .",
    "but its hi  distribution and kinematics are very different , as we will show .",
    "generally , a wide range of morphologies and kinematics is found in hickson compact groups ( huchtmeier 1997 ; verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "2001 ) , indicating the high complexity of the on - going interactions in these dense groups .",
    "this paper is the third in a series of hi  studies of interacting galaxies , which started with a detailed study of the spectacular interacting galaxy pair ngc  4038/9 ( `` the antennae '' ; gordon , koribalski & jones 2001 , see also hibbard et al .",
    "2001 ) , followed by the peculiar galaxy system ic  2554 ( koribalski , gordon & jones 2003 ) . here",
    "we study the hi  gas distribution and kinematics of the galaxies in the ngc  6845 group . in all three systems we detected additional dwarf members which is quite common in studies of ( interacting ) galaxy groups .",
    "the ngc  6845 quartet ( klemola  30 , eso284ig008 ) is a compact group of two spiral and two lenticular galaxies which were first described in a proper motion survey by klemola ( 1969 ) and later by graham & rubin ( 1973 ) .",
    "all four galaxies have similar systemic velocities , suggesting they are physically close , and are classified as peculiar . for a summary of some optical properties",
    "see table  1 .",
    "deep optical images ( rose 1979 ; rose & graham 1979 ) show clear signs of galaxy interactions such as a bright tail or bridge as well as numerous faint wisps and filaments .",
    "the four galaxies lie roughly in a line ( see fig .  1 ) and are named b , a , c , and d from ne to sw , with ngc  6845a being the largest galaxy of the group .    optically , the ngc  6845 quartet extends over @xmath5 and has a mean optical recession velocity of @xmath66600kms@xmath3 .",
    "assuming h@xmath7 = 75kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 this velocity implies a hubble distance of @xmath8 = 88mpc and a scale size of @xmath9kpc .",
    "the projected size of the group is @xmath6100kpc .",
    "the two spiral galaxies , ngc  6845a and b , show the strongest signs of interaction , with the most prominent feature being an apparent bridge between the galaxies ( fig .  1 ; see also rodrigues et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "ngc  6845a is a nearly edge - on , barred spiral galaxy with a bright nuclear region as well as hii  regions at both ends of the bar .",
    "the latter are the bases of the spiral or tidal arms .",
    "deep optical images ( see e.g. rose 1979 ; laustsen , madsen & west 1987 , plate 85 ) clearly show the bright eastern arm extending towards ngc  6845b , resembling a bridge between the two galaxies .",
    "the much less prominent western arm shows very faint extensions toward the sw , then appears to loop back towards ngc  6845a , passing the slightly more distant lenticular galaxies ngc  6845c and d in projection ( see also rose & graham 1979 ) .",
    "ngc  6845b is a compact , nearly face - on spiral galaxy with a rather disturbed appearance .",
    "it shows several filamentary extensions which are likely distorted spiral arms or material pulled out of the disk .",
    "rodrigues et al .",
    "( 1999 ) carried out extensive optical spectroscopy and photometry of the ngc  6845 quartet as well as short vla hi  observations .",
    "they found two hi  components associated with ngc  6845a and b , with a total hi  mass of @xmath10m@xmath1 , as well as five very bright hii   regions in the tidal bridge .",

    "a 16 mhz - wide bandpass was centered on 1389 mhz , returning two polarisations in each of the 512 channels . during calibration , highly attenuated channels at the bandpass edges",

    "the resulting beam is @xmath11 . the aips task _ momnt _ was applied to the hi  cube to produce integrated hi  intensity ( 0.moment ) maps over various velocity ranges ( see section  3.1 ) , an intensity - weighted mean velocity field ( 1.moment ) and an hi  velocity dispersion ( 2.moment ) map , using 3-pixel ` boxcar ' spatial smoothing , 3-channel hanning smoothing and a lower flux density cutoff of 2.25 mjybeam@xmath3 .",
    "additional hi  moment maps from individual and combined hi  components ( see section  3.1 ) have been prepared by masking the channel maps .",
    "these were smoothed by convolution with an 18  gaussian , and then clipped at the 1.5 mjybeam@xmath3 level to suppress noise .",
    "the resulting beam is @xmath12 , slightly larger than before .",
    "the 20-cm radio continuum maps were produced using ` robust ' weighting ( robust = 0.5 ) of the line - free channels resulting in a beam size of @xmath13 and an r.m.s .",

    "another example of a compact group with predominantly edge - on galaxies is the hickson compact group ( hcg ) 26 ; the hi  distribution and velocity field in hcg  26 ( williams & van gorkom 1995 ) is remarkably similar to that of the ngc  6845 quartet . in these edge - on systems",
    "it is more difficult to analyse the interactions between galaxies as the curvature of the tidal tails , which are often projected onto the galaxies themselves , can only be inferred from the velocity field .",
    "both in the ngc  6845 quartet and hcg  26 , higher resolution hi  observations are needed to study the galaxy interactions in detail .",
    "since ngc6845c and d appear to play a marginal role in the quartet , we may compare ngc  6845a / b with other interacting galaxy pairs .",
    "e.g. , we note some similarity between the galaxy ngc  6845a and the giant barred spiral galaxy ngc  6872 .",
    "both galaxies have at least one smaller companion , are very extended ( @xmath6100 kpc ) and cover a large velocity range .",
    "their extended spiral arms appear to be tidally stretched and both are gas - rich galaxies with hi  masses above 10@xmath53m@xmath1 .",
    "their gas dynamics differ dramatically indicating different evolutionary stages .",
    "whereas the hi  gas is centrally concentrated in ngc  6845 , it is predominantly located in the spiral arms of ngc  6872 ( horellou & koribalski 2002 ) .",
    "* this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with nasa .",
    "* we acknowledge the use of images from the digitised sky survey ( dss ) based on photographic data obtained using the uk schmidt telescope .",
    "the integrated hi  flux density of ngc  6845 ( hipass j200047 ) as obtained from the hi  parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ) is @xmath616@xmath243 jykms@xmath3 . fig .",

    "noise level = 8.4 mjy ) , which has a much lower velocity resolution and sensitivity than the atca hi  spectrum ( fig .",
    "6a ) , but shows a very similar shape ( as expected ) .",
    "the horizontal line marks the fitted first order baseline , the vertical lines mark the velocity range of the detected hi  emission , and the dots show the locations of the peak flux density ( 50 mjy ) , 50% velocity width ( 376kms@xmath3 ) and 20% velocity width ( 630kms@xmath3 ) . for details regarding hipass",
