    "sodium is one of the closest realizations of the free - electron gas that can be found in solid - state materials . under compression",
    ", however , the simple metal behavior of na is deeply modified by non - free - electron - like features of its band structure ; these are mainly associated to the increasing electronic hybridization of the chemical bondings and the strong non - local character of the pseudopotential , among other causes .",
    "@xcite as a consequence , sodium under pressure develops a variety of unexpected processes including phase transitions to extremely complex structures  @xcite , loss of the metallic character  @xcite or anomalies in the optical response to external fields  @xcite .",

    "sodium undergoes a series of structural phase transformations from 0 to @xmath0180 gpa before it experiences a metal - insulator transition that suppresses its metallic properties . over this wide pressure range ,",
    "sodium first adopts the bcc structure ( 0 to 65 gpa ) , followed by the fcc ( 65 to 105 gpa ) , the ci16 ( 105 to 118 gpa ) , the op8 ( 118 to 125 gpa ) and the ti19 ( 125 to @xmath0180 gpa ) configurations .",
    "@xcite similar to what happens in other _ a priori _ simple metals , such as lithium or calcium , the metallic properties of sodium at high pressures are strongly modified .",
    "in particular , the high and uniform reflectivity ( characteristic of good metals ) of the bcc , fcc and ci16 phases has been measured to drop drastically in the high pressure phases op8 and ti19 , accompanied by a decrease of the metallic character .",
    "@xcite the origin of such behavior may lie on the emergence of low - energy interband plasmons arising from the increasing localization of the valence electrons ,  @xcite as it is the case of li and ca .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we perform a detailed _ ab - initio _ analysis of the electronic properties of na in a pressure domain ranging from 0 to 180 gpa , covering all the metallic phases of sodium at room temperature . in the spirit of ref .",

    "this approach allows us to perform a very accurate sampling of the relevant functions in reciprocal space , which is essential for describing the low - energy excitations that determine the response function .",
    "as it will be shown , our calculations predict the existence of a very low - energy plasmon in the op8 and ti19 phases of sodium that explains the anomalous optical properties measured at the corresponding pressures .",

    "[ fig : op8-epsilon ] , for @xmath102 our calculations evidence a gap between the intraband and interband excitations in the @xmath00 - 0.6 ev energy range , where @xmath56 completely vanishes . driven by the kramers - kronig relations , the gap and the subsequent interband excitations contributing to the imaginary part ( @xmath103 ev ) force the real part of the dielectric function to become positive at @xmath99 ev , giving rise to the low - energy interband plasmon at that energy .",
    "the relevant interband excitations contributing to @xmath86 in the * * q**@xmath1040 limit are characterized in the band structure of op8 na depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : op8-bands - dos ] , alongside with the calculated dos , which reproduces the weakening of the metallic character at the fermi level reported in other works  @xcite . as indicated by the red arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : op8-bands - dos ] , there exist quasi - parallel occupied - unoccupied bands separated by 1 - 2 ev along various directions in reciprocal space : zt , @xmath1z , xs and @xmath1y , among others .",
    "the energy difference between these bands coincides with the interband excitations contributing to @xmath86 for @xmath105 ev ( see top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : op8-epsilon ] ) , and are therefore directly responsible for the emergence of the low - energy plasmon at that energy .      at 125 gpa sodium adopts the ti19 structure  @xcite . as in the op8 phase ,",
    "we have also characterized a very low - energy plasmon , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ti19-epsilon ] , that induces a sudden dip on the optical reflectivity at around 0.25 ev ( see fig . [",
    "fig : reflectivity ] ) , in qualitative agreement with optical measurements  @xcite .",
    "we find two major differences between the reflectivity spectrum of the op8 and ti19 phases .",
    "first , the minimum of @xmath95 ranges from @xmath106 to @xmath107 throughout the stability pressure range of the ti19 phase , whereas in the op8 phase @xmath108 at the dip .",
    "second , unlike in the case of op8 na , the reflectivity of ti19 na is almost totally recovered in the infrared regime , i.e. @xmath109 for @xmath110 ev .",
    "these experimentally supported features  @xcite indicate that ti19 na shows better metallic properties than op8 na , excluding a possible metal - insulator transition between the two phases .",

    "[ fig : ti19-epsilon ] .",
    "we find that the low - energy plasmon persists over all the studied domain .",
    "moreover , our calculations indicate that the plasmon becomes undamped as pressure is increased , i.e. its linewidth decreases with increasing pressure ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ti19-epsilon]b ) . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ti19-epsilon]a , @xmath86 does not completely vanish in the @xmath111 ev range , where @xmath89 becomes vanishingly small . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting plasmon acquires a finite linewidth . since @xmath86 decreases ( approaches zero ) with increasing pressure , so does the plasmon linewidth .",
    "fig : ti19-band - structure ] we show the calculated electronic band structure and dos of ti19 na at 125 , 150 and 180 gpa .",
    "the electronic excitations contributing to @xmath86 in the @xmath112 ev range ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ti19-epsilon]a ) are characterized by red arrows , evidencing , as in the op8 phase , the interband nature of the low - energy plasmon .",
    "another important detail revealed by fig .",
    "[ fig : ti19-band - structure ] is that ti19 na develops two hole - pockets , one around high symmetry point p and the other one halfway between @xmath1 and x. low - energy intraband excitations to these hole - pockets are the reason why @xmath86 does not completely vanish in the @xmath113 ev energy range . furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig : ti19-band - structure ] indicates that the area of the hole - pockets diminishes with increasing pressure , yielding weaker low - energy excitations at high pressures .",
    "we conclude that the damping of the low - energy plasmon revealed by fig .",
    "[ fig : ti19-epsilon]b is directly associated to the evolution of the hole - pockets under pressure .",
    "to conclude our analysis , in fig .",
    "[ fig : plasmon - density ] we illustrate the plasmon evolution of sodium in the optical limit ( * * q**@xmath114 ) as a function of the density , covering all the phases from 0 to 180 gpa .",
    "this figure makes it clear that sodium increasingly departs from the free - electron - like model as its density is raised .",
    "in particular , the figure evidences a complete breakdown of the free - electron - like picture at the high pressure phases ci16 , op8 and ti19 .",
    "classically , the plasmon energy should increase with the density , but our calculations show a marked decrease in the plasmon energy in the ci16 and op8 phases , accompanied by a huge increase of the plasmon linewidth .",
    "finally , our calculations predict the absence of intraband plasmons in the ti19 phase , where only the low - energy interband plasmon is present .",
    "therefore , sodium represents a clear example of how pressure can induce great complexity even in the simplest elements .    in this paper",
    "we have presented theoretical _",
    "ab - initio _ calculations regarding the dielectric response of bulk sodium in its 5 known metallic phases from 0 to 180 gpa at room temperature .",
    "we have employed a formalism based on a wannier interpolation scheme that provides a very accurate sampling of reciprocal space and allows the resolution of sharp features associated to the dielectric function . in this way",
    ", we predict the existence of a low - energy plasmon in the high pressure phases op8 and ti19 that explains the anomalous behavior in the recently measured optical reflectivity ,  @xcite also reproduced by our calculations .",
    "the combined analysis of the ks response function and the electronic band structure reveals the interband nature of this low - energy plasmon , associated to electron - hole transitions between a network of quasi - parallel occupied - unoccupied bands .",
    "additionally , our calculations characterize an anisotropic interband plasmon all along the stability pressure range of the fcc configuration ( 65 to 105 gpa ) , revealing an unexpected departure of fcc na from the free - electron model . this remarkable plasmon is found exclusively along the @xmath1l direction due to an anisotropic non - free - electron - like band structure effect .",
