    "soft materials , such as particle dispersions , exhibit a wide range of rheological properties .",
    "while dilute colloids flow with a viscosity only slightly higher than that of the solvent , concentrated dispersions behave as soft amorphous solids . under large deformations",
    ", they may yield and flow with a strongly shear - rate dependent viscosity , while their structure can remain amorphous and homogeneous @xcite .    in order to address the nonlinear rheology of such viscoelastic colloidal dispersions , recently , a first - principles constitutive equation under arbitrary time - dependent homogeneous flow",
    "was developed @xcite .",
    "it includes transitions to arrested glassy states as function of the thermodynamic control parameters , thus allowing the interaction between slow structural relaxation and time - dependent external flow to be investigated .",
    "the approach generalizes the integrations through transients ( itt ) approach developed for steadily sheared dispersions @xcite to the general situation .",
    "it concentrates on the thermodynamic stresses arising from potential and brownian interactions between the particles , because they overwhelm hydrodynamic contributions close to vitrification and at low deformation rates , and because they are dominated by slow structural rearrangements , which can be approximated using mode coupling techniques @xcite .",
    "a colloidal model system of hard spheres was developed @xcite , and experiments at high densities were performed @xcite to test the connection between glassy dynamics and nonlinear rheology , which is at the heart of the theoretical approach . to this end ,",
    "linear frequency dependent shear moduli and nonlinear shear rate dependent flow curves were measured and analysed in parallel @xcite . here ,",
    "we summarize some of the observations on the steady state flow curves and provide some new insights into the flow curves close to the glass transition .",
    "the microscopic theoretical approach @xcite starts with a system of @xmath0 spherical brownian particles interacting via internal forces and dispersed in a solvent with a specified velocity profile @xmath1 .",
    "the time - dependent velocity gradient tensor @xmath2 is assumed spatially constant , thus excluding the non - homogeneous flows which occur in shear - banded and shear - localized states .",
    "while hydrodynamic interactions and fluctuations in the velocity profile are thus neglected from the outset , this statistical mechanics model can be investigated by brownian dynamics simulations @xcite , and constitutes a first microscopic approach to real glassy colloidal suspensions .",
    "the properties of this microscopic model have been worked out for low densities ( partially even including hydrodynamic interactions @xcite ) , and it provides the starting point for various ( approximate ) theories for intermediate concentrations .",
    "considering , for the sake of discussion , the example of steady shearing @xcite , the aim of the microscopic approach is to compute the stationary many - body distribution function , which is possible albeit only approximately .",
    "it describes the complete probability distribution of the particle positions , and using it any stationary average can be computed .",
    "its computation is achieved using formally exact projection operator manipulations and generalized green - kubo relations , followed by mode coupling approximations , which share similarities with mean field approximations @xcite .",
    "the approximations implement the assumption that slow structural rearrangements dominate the thermodynamic stresses in dense dispersions , and that they can be approximated using ( transient ) density correlation functions .",
    "the later are taken from equations of motions closed with ( again ) mode coupling approximations .",
    "competition of structural slowing down ( called cage effect ) with flow induced decorrelation ( flow advection entering via cauchy - green tensors @xcite ) and cut - off of memory , determines the distorted microstructure and the stresses .",
    "universal aspects of the predicted rheology can be captured in schematic models , like the @xmath3-model , which retain the nontrivial dynamical scaling laws of the microscopic approach , but simplify its spatial structure .",
    "the particles consist of a solid core of poly(styrene ) onto which a network of crosslinked poly(n - isopropylacrylamide ) ( pnipam ) is affixed .",

    "the dependence of the packing fraction @xmath5 ( viz .",
    "the relative volume taken by the spheres ) on the temperature is given by the hydrodynamic radius @xmath6 determined from dynamic light scattering in the dilute regime .",

    "[ fighb ] .",
    "the dynamic yield stress @xmath35 can be read off by extrapolating the flow curve in the glass to vanishing shear rate .",
    "while this agreement supports the prediction of a dynamic yield stress in the itt approach and demonstrates the usefulness of this concept , small deviations in the flow curve at low @xmath34 are present .",
    "they indicate the existence of an additional slow dissipative process which may correspond to a melting of the glass at even longer times or smaller shear rates beyond the experimental window .",
    "recently , the connection was emphasized between the physics of the glass transition and the rheology of dense colloidal dispersions , including in strong homogeneous flow @xcite . the equilibrium structure factor and one time scale ( obtained from matching to short time motion and affected by hydrodynamic interactions )",
