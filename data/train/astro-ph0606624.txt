    "asteroseismology describes mainly the propagation of matter waves and their eigenmodes in stars ( or planets ) that are considered as cavities . by an inverse procedure one can then deduce the physical properties of the layers crossed by the waves .",
    "it is a very effective tool , and often the unique one to study the internal structure of stars . since several decades",
    ", many intensive works were undertaken , especially for the sun , to calculate precisely the oscillation modes and to understand the physical mechanisms involved .",
    "different reviews are dedicated to this subject .",
    "semi - analytical approaches have been developed , essentially based on various asymptotic approximations .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite , and , have explored the first - order asymptotic approximation , and have helped to interpret the high - order modes measured for the sun .",
    "then with the availability of low - order modes , @xcite , , , have taken into account the effect of gravity in second - order theories , allowing to better describe the propagation in central regions of stars . on another hand ,",
    "numerical calculations are required to reach the high precision in frequency determination , needed for inversion of stellar internal layer physics .",
    "several high accuracy oscillation codes already exist , offering the computation of eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "they have been widely used to interpret the large amount of solar modes observed from earth or space .    just at the beginning of the spatial - asteroseismology era",
    ", it is worth assessing the progress of these theoretical efforts in the prediction of observations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the agreement between numerical results and observations is remarkable in the range 1000 - 2400 @xmath1hz where @xmath3 is contained in @xmath01 @xmath1hz . at larger frequencies however , the disagreement increases gradually , up to 20 @xmath1hz at 5000 @xmath1hz .",
    "semi - analytical results agree well with numerical ones only in that high - frequency range , while their dispersion at lower frequencies stays important even when they have been reduced by the second order approximation .",
    "moreover , the acoustic cut - off frequency is theoretically predicted around 5000 @xmath1hz , while from observations it is rather around 5600 @xmath1hz @xcite .",
    "those difficulties can be overcome in the case of the sun thanks to the great number of eigenmodes accessible by observations .",
    "but such difference could be more problematic in asteroseismology as only low - degree modes ( @xmath4 ) are available and the stellar radius and mass are less known .    the discrepancy between calculation and observation",
    "is generally attributed to an incorrect description of the outer layers of the current solar models at the surface .",
    "several studies have tried to introduce a more relevant model of convection via the introduction of a turbulent pressure @xcite . that reduces the discrepancy at high frequencies , but the excellent agreement at low frequencies is also deteriorated @xcite .",
    "the role of the chromosphere was also invoked , but no real improvement is yet obtained .    with the regular progress of observational instruments ,",
    "these remaining problems become more crucial : the theory - observation discrepancies at high frequencies and the inaccuracy of semi - analytical methods at low frequencies are up to 100 times larger than observational errors .",
    "so , we suggest to search the reasons not only in the solar model at the surface , _ but also _ in the eigenmode calculation itself , especially about the wave description in the solar interior and the boundary conditions at the surface .",
    "concepts closer to classical wave physics remain to be further explored .",
    "it can be considered as a continuation of the works of and @xcite .",
    "some first acoustic - frequency calculations was attempted in @xcite , and the effect of gravitational potential was taken into account in @xcite . in this paper , we aim to further formalize the concepts , by putting a special accent on the internal and external boundary conditions .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in  2 , a new p - mode calculation is developed .",
    "its approximations and its boundary conditions are proved to be in accordance with the jwkb method . in  3 ,",
    "the obtained results are first compared to present numerical calculations , and some drawbacks of the isothermal atmosphere approximation are pointed out .",
    "then in  4 comparisons with observations suggest a way to improve solar surface descriptions , and at the same time to evaluate the potential of the proposed method .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in  5 .    in this paper ,",
    "the solar model used is the seismic model @xcite , computed with the cesam code @xcite .",
    "the numerical results for solar oscillations are obtained with the adipls code @xcite .",
    "acoustic mode observations of the sun come from the soho spacecraft ( mdi data from @xcite ; golf data from @xcite , and from @xcite.the graphic representation for modes of degrees @xmath5 to 10 follows the symbols indicated in figure [ fig_legende ] .",
    "the present study starts from the standpoint that observed solar modes , due to their regularity and their precision , are related to waves in its most classical sense , excluding shock waves , wave buckets , etc .",
    "basically eigenfrequencies are the signature of waves trapped in a cavity .",
    "a wave is the propagation of an oscillation .",
    "an oscillation is a continuous exchange between kinetic and potential energy around an _",
    "equilibrium state_. here the notion of equilibrium state is the central one . where this latter ends",
    ", there is no possible oscillation , thus no more propagation , the wave becomes evanescent . at this point ,",
    "the wave is reflected . that determines the turning point , i.e. the cavity limit .",
    "inside a huge gazeous sphere maintained by gravity like a star , two kinds of equilibrium can be considered : the equilibrium between stratums of different pressure , and the pressure equilibrium inside each stratum , that is the local homogeneity .",
    "every pressure perturbation generates two oscillations : a gravity one around an equilibrium stratum , and an acoustic one around a point of local equilibrium .",
    "the two induced waves do not interact between them , unless their frequencies are close to each other .",
    "for the sun , excepted around 500 @xmath1hz where coupling has to be considered , acoustic and gravity waves can be studied separately .",
    "the present approach is also applicable for all stars where acoustic and gravity frequencies are well separated .",
    "let us now concentrate only on pure acoustic waves . by definition , such a wave can only propagate in a locally homogeneous environment , or more precisely homogeneous as regard to its wavelength .",
    "if the pressure scale height can be seen as representative of the homogeneity , the propagation condition can be expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the wavelength , @xmath8 the wavenumber , @xmath9 the pressure scale height projected on the propagation direction @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a constant to be determined . to be exhaustive , this coefficient could be considered as the first one of a taylor expansion in @xmath7 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or similar parameters .",
    "these coefficients should be determined once , by experiments on earth , or spatial experiments , or theoretical studies , but they are not specific to a star .",
    "when a condition of the type of equation ( [ prop_cond ] ) is no longer satisfied , the wave can no longer propagate and is reflected .",
    "the reflection conditions are different , following the current pressure variation .",
    "if that happens where the pressure is increasing , for the wave , everything is like it encounters a wall , the reflection gets the properties of the ` pressure wall ' type . on the opposite case , that are the properties of the ` pressure vacuum ' type . for this",
    "latter , in the absence of any other force , the force balance at the boundary requires that the perturbed pressure at the discontinuity is @xmath14 one must have a pressure node , corresponding to a displacement antinode , because , as seen below , there is a phase lag of @xmath15/2 between them .",
    "we will see that it is the case at the upper atmosphere limit : the last layer freely vibrates under the action of acoustic waves .",
    "the situation is exactly the same at the free end of a spring laying horizontally on a frictionless surface on earth .",
    "now , in the presence of the gravity force , the force balance requires that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the perturbed gravity , and @xmath18 is the equilibrium density that can be brought out the integral thanks to the local homogeneity approximation .",
    "note that the sign used in this context is opposite to that of the continuity equation . as seen later",
    ", this will be the situation for the radial mode at the internal boundary .",
    "this looks like vibrations at the free end of a spring vertically hung in the earth gravity field .    from this viewpoint ,",
    "the reflexion occurs at a given radius , and the continuity condition must be regarded at the two sides of this fixed limit , thus the perturbed pressure considered should be eulerian .",
    "this is different from the perspective where the limit is not fixed in space but follows the displacement generated by the perturbation , where the lagrangian perturbed pressure is considered .",
    "the wave propagation and reflection are so far completely defined in their principles .",
    "we are in the approximation context of local homogeneity , or pure acoustic wave , or of local wave , i.e. the wave is only defined locally .",
    "it is important to stress that in this approximation , the environment is _ not _ homogeneous , but slowly variable .",
    "this choice is only guided by the aim of describing what is called a ` local - acoustic ' wave .",
    "the precision reached with this approximation is not known a priori , so it will be estimated on the view of its expressions and its numerical results , compared to other methods .",
    "after a perturbation , the wave propagation is fully described by the four eulerian functions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , which are respectively the displacement , along with the perturbations of pressure , density and gravitational potential . in the hypotheses of adiabacity , sphericity and linearity , and",
    "when the time , angular , and radial parts have been separated , these unknown functions are governed by the following differential equations where only remains the radial part ( see e.g. @xcite ,",
    "p.54 ) : @xmath23 with r the distance to the stellar center , and @xmath24 the mode degree .",
    "the other symbols stand for medium equilibrium quantities : @xmath25 , @xmath18 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the pressure , the density , the sound speed , and the gravity ; @xmath12 is the pressure scale height , @xmath28 the buoyancy frequency , and @xmath29 the adiabatic exponent .",
    "that is in fact a system of 3 differential equations of fourth order .",
    "equation ( [ init_eq_3 ] ) in @xmath21 is added only for the sake of exhaustiveness .",
    "that system of differential equations can only be solved numerically .",
    "an analytical solution needs further approximations . due to that",
    ", results obtained by numerical codes are more precise and realistic than those of analytical methods .",
    "nevertheless , the final result crucially depends on boundary conditions that are _ not _ contained in those equations .",
    "the choice of boundary conditions comes from physical considerations , and analytical calculations can be helpful for that , especially when their results are precise enough to be not too far from numerical ones , or in other words , and that is an evidence , when the approximations used are not too crude .    in order to find an analytical solution",
    ", we propose to use the above suggested approximation of local homogeneity ( but _ not _ of homogeneity ) , where the derivatives of the equilibrium quantities are only negligible when compared to equilibrium quantities themselves .",
    "only the relative derivatives , namely @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and thus @xmath32 , can be neglected .",
    "this also mathematically justify a validity condition of the type of equation ( [ prop_cond ] ) . in that context ,",

    "otherwise exponential solutions should be considered . to be exhaustive",
    ", a general solution has to be added to the particular solution @xmath22 , but it will play a role only for radial modes very near the center , so we will invoke it only in section [ internal turning point leq 0 ] .",
    "equations ( [ p_sol]-[ksir_sol ] ) are the expressions of a spherical wave that is well defined only locally",
    ". the amplitude @xmath46 and the phase @xmath47 are not constant but almost constant . at a given radius @xmath44 ,",
    "the radial wavenumber @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 and , for a spherical wave , its horizontal component is @xmath50    thus the wave number is @xmath51 the amplitude of the radial displacement is further evaluated in appendix [ eigenfunction ] .",
    "the sound speed , or the phase velocity of the sound wave is ( in a propagative medium where @xmath52 ) @xmath53 which is equal to @xmath26 only when @xmath54 is negligible compared to 1 .",
    "this propagative wave solution is surprisingly simple .",
    "discussions about its relevance are needed , as well in the interior than at the surface of the star .      in the stellar interior , a wave solution given by equations ( [ p_sol]-[ksir_sol ] )",
    "are all the more simple as the gravitational perturbation is already taken into account .",
    "there is no need to develop to higher orders in @xmath22 .",
    "the latter is considered at the same rank than the other perturbations @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , like it should be naturally .",
    "the final results obtained should be more precise and more realistic .",
    "indeed , as only the relative gradients of equilibrium quantities are neglected , and not the gradients themselves , the gravity that is linked to the pressure gradient is not neglected .",
    "physically , acoustic waves have enough short wavelengths not to see the gravitational stratification at large scale , but they will progressively pass through a non constant , hydrostatic structure governed by gravity .",
    "the non - negligible gravitational potential and its perturbation are seen by the term @xmath55 in equation ( [ acous_eq_4 ] ) .",
    "the consequence is that the obtained accuracy will be the same for all ranges of @xmath24 or @xmath56 ( except for frequencies near gravity frequencies ) , contrary to restrictions of large @xmath24 or @xmath56 imposed by more drastic asymptotic approximations .",
    "another advantage is the autocoherence concerning the spherical eigenvalue @xmath57 which will be maintained the same all along the present study .",
    "there is no need to replace it by @xmath58 , a trick sometimes employed at low-@xmath24 ( ! ) , whose the artificial character is clearly pointed out in @xcite .",
    "it is also easy now to bring an answer to the controversial question about the fact that the radial mode ( @xmath59 ) reaches or not the center : due to its spherical nature , described by the term in @xmath60 in equation ( [ p_sol ] ) , the wave can never touch the center , whatever the value of @xmath24 .",
    "the non - radial waves reach their internal turning points where @xmath61 , while the case of radial waves are examined in details in section [ internal turning point leq 0 ] below .      at the surface ,",
    "the term @xmath62 can be neglected , equation ( [ kr2 ] ) becomes @xmath63 and generally , for not too large @xmath24 , @xmath64 which is particularly simple .",
    "the important issue is that @xmath48 continuously increases toward the surface .",
    "yet it was established by current asymptotic approximations that the expression of @xmath48 goes to zero near the surface , and that location could be considered as the external turning point .",
    "does it mean that equation ( [ kr_surf ] ) is obtained in a too approximated context , and some terms could have been missed ?",
    "it is actually possible to derive a less approximated propagation equation than equation ( [ acous_final_eq ] ) , in the following way .    at the surface , and for not too large @xmath24 , it is legitimate to remove the terms @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the terms in @xmath22 from equations ( [ init_eq_1]-[init_eq_2 ] ) , which become @xmath67 providing that @xmath68 @xmath69 and using equations ( [ gen_asymp_1]-[gen_asymp_2 ] ) in the derivation of equation ( [ gen_asymp_1 ] ) , one obtains : @xmath70 to avoid the term in @xmath71 , introduce @xmath72 as : @xmath73 to obtain the propagation equation : @xmath74 ^ 2 -\\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{d}{dr }   \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\gamma_1 p_0 } \\frac{d(\\gamma_1 p_0)}{dr } \\right ] \\bigg\\ } k = 0 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ gen_asymp_k ] ) is a generalization of what is derived in current asymptotic approximations .",
    "indeed , when @xmath75 is constant , the two terms after @xmath76 cancel each other out , and if further more @xmath29 is constant , it looks more familiar : @xmath77 k=0.\\ ] ] at the surface , these last equations are indisputably less approximated than those obtained in the local homogeneity approximation .",
    "the deduced @xmath48 goes to zero near the surface .",
    "but for all that , are those last expressions more relevant ? can them be used to determine the external turning points ?",
    "to answer , a detour by the jwkb approach is necessary .",
    "following appendix [ the jwkb approach ] , equations ( [ gen_asymp_k ] , [ gen_asymp_k_appr ] ) admit a wave - like solution only when the conditions of equation ( [ jwkb_cond ] ) are verified , i.e. when properties of the medium vary slowly .",
    "the jwkb approximation also predicts that in these conditions , there is no wave reflection , or at least the reflections are negligible . in the opposite case , there is no wave - like solution and reflections will occur .",
    "an important consequence is that , generally , in order to be able to apply jwkb , the expression of @xmath78 can only contain medium variables at the same derivation order .",
    "for example , if the equilibrium pressure @xmath25 appears in @xmath78 , then the derivatives @xmath79 must be negligible , if not the conditions of equation ( [ jwkb_cond ] ) can not be verified ( except for very specific cases ) . if it contains @xmath80 , then it should contain neither @xmath25 nor @xmath81 .",
    "another consequence is that when the jwkb approximation is applicable , and only in this case , the sign of @xmath82 indicates the propagation or evanescent character .",
    "it is also clear that when @xmath83 , the conditions of equation ( [ jwkb_cond ] ) are of course violated , and there is reflection .",
    "but we should not forget that reflection immediately occurs whenever those conditions are no more valid , even when @xmath78 is very far from zero . and we should keep in mind that _ those reflection conditions are not contained in the expression of @xmath48 alone_.    it appears therefore that the @xmath48 deduced from equations ( [ gen_asymp_k ] ) or ( [ gen_asymp_k_appr ] ) contains @xmath84 as well as their derivatives , thus is generally rapidly variable , thus the jwkb approach can not be applied , and its zeros have no special physical sense .",
    "it just means that when the relative derivatives of equilibrium quantities can not be neglected , we are in the evanescent part , outside the resonant cavity .",
    "this is coherent with the local - homogeneity analysis .",
    "( in fact , equation ( [ gen_asymp_k_appr ] ) indicates that the jwkb method can nevertheless be applied in the very special case where both @xmath26 and @xmath12 are slowly variable , so that @xmath85 can be neglected .",
    "it is the case for an isothermal atmosphere which will be discussed further in section [ discussion on the outer boundary conditions ] ) .    on the contrary , in the context of local homogeneity , i.e. slowly variable medium ,",
    "the @xmath48 obtained in equation ( [ kr2 ] ) _ automatically _ satisfies the jwkb application conditions . in the present case of spherical modes ,",
    "the internal cavity limits are generally situated towards the center where the medium is really slowly variable , and the turning points will be determined by @xmath83 , or very close to that . concerning the external limit , the cause of rapidly variable medium should rather be invoked . in other words ,",
    "an acoustic wave turns back in the interior because of its own spherical nature , and at the surface because of an abrupt medium change .",
    "this internal / external dissymmetry can be seen on the wave trajectories ( fig .",
    "[ fig_trajectories ] ) .    from that long but necessary discussion",
    ", it can be concluded that conceptually , the local homogeneity approximation and its cavity limit criteria are nothing but a physical translation of the jwkb mathematical expression .      when the acoustic wave is reflected at the external and internal limits of a star , we are in the presence of standing waves inside a cavity , where only determined frequencies will be favoured . the sum of forward and backward waves forms standing waves with nodes and antinodes separated by @xmath15 in phase @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 stands for @xmath41 , or @xmath20 , or @xmath21 or @xmath22 . following figure [ fig_standing_wave ] ,",
    "it is clear that the phase advance between the turning points @xmath89 and @xmath90 should verify @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the number of nodes along r , called the mode order , and @xmath93 is a parameter to adjust following the phase conditions at @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "for example , if there are two antinodes at the two limits , @xmath94 , if there are one node and one antinode , @xmath95 . if there are two nodes , @xmath96 .",
    "the convention adopted here is to count every node of the _ displacement _ @xmath41 .    .",
    "[ fig_standing_wave ]    the relation ( [ duvall ] ) is largely used in different approaches for interpreting solar acoustic eigenfrequencies @xcite .",
    "even so , attention must be paid that @xmath90 is sometimes assimilated to r , the star radius , while it is _ not _ the case here .",
    "this apparently small subtility is in fact fundamental . indeed , assuming @xmath97 is a crude approximation leading to frequency errors of tens of @xmath1hz .",
    "any attempt to compensate it , amounts to make a variable change while integrating ( [ duvall ] ) , therefore to work with a wavenumber @xmath48 that is not the real one .",
    "so @xmath93 is not the same than that employed here .",
    "moreover , the phase conditions at external and internal turning points are completely mixed .",
    "the overall consequence is that one is not working in the real world , but in a kind of phase space .    here , by working with @xmath90 and",
    "not r , the eigenmode determination becomes similar to what is done for an acoustic cavity on earth , just like for any musical instrument .",
    "the eigenfunctions projected on the radial direction are given by the standing wave expression ( eq .",
    "[ standing_wave ] ) , and the eigenfrequencies are determined by the duvall expression ( [ duvall ] ) .",
    "thus , to obtain the full solution it only remains to determine the internal and external turning points together with the phase conditions at these points , i.e. namely @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath93 .",
    "let us begin to look at the external reflection conditions because they are the simplest ones , for the phase as well as for the location .",
    "following what has been discussed in section [ the present approach ] , at the surface , the acoustic wave is reflected when a ` pressure vacuum ' is encountered . for the wave , everything looks like the end of the matter . like any matter wave encountering a ` matter vacuum ' , there is an antinode at this point for the displacement ( think e.g. about longitudinal standing waves along a spring with a free end ) . that determines the phase .    for the location of reflection , we must look at the projection of @xmath12 onto the propagation direction . neglecting the surface curvature",
    "( see figure [ fig_hp_k ] ) , the propagation condition , equation ( [ prop_cond ] ) , becomes @xmath98 knowing that the phase speed ( eq . [ phase_speed ] ) at the surface is @xmath26 .",
    "the constant @xmath99 , v standing for vacuum , remains to be determined .",
    "this task concerns typically the boundary conditions that _ can not _ be already included in the initial differential equations .",
    "something else than the physics of wave propagation should be considered . in order to avoid theoretical results which are not totally reliable at the surface",
    ", we can choose the experimental sun s cut - off frequency combined with the semi - empirical atmosphere of @xcite . according to @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the observed sun s cut - off frequency is @xmath100 in this frequency range and at the surface , equation ( [ prop_cond_ext ] ) can be simplified to @xmath101 figure [ fig_ae ] shows that , in order that the last mode trapped is at 5600 @xmath1hz , @xmath99 should be : @xmath102 this value could be refined by more sophisticated methods . for the moment , note that a change of @xmath99 by + 0.1 , will lead to a general frequency shift of about -2 @xmath1hz .",
    "conceptually speaking , the determination of the cavity external limit of a star is similar to that of a wind musical instrument with an open end .",
    "there , like for the sun , one cavity end is not materially delimited while the eigenfrequencies are precisely defined .",
    "there also , the absence of an elaborate theory can be overcome by the use of experimental results to determine the equivalent external limits @xcite .",
    "so all the external reflection conditions are defined .    in figure [ fig_ex_r2 ]",
    "are given some examples of external turning points determined by the intersection of the two curves expressed in equation ( [ prop_cond_ext ] ) , for @xmath59 , 1 , 2 , 3 and @xmath103 .",
    "in such a diagram , the very low frequency modes @xmath59 , 1 and @xmath104 , 2 will have their representative curves under that of @xmath105 at several locations , which means that they hardly exist , the sun structure being too inhomogeneous from their wavelength point of view .      in the deep interior where the structure can be considered as locally homogeneous , there is no problem of boundary conditions and thus no genuine reflection point .",
    "( except for some very low @xmath107 modes , see the section above , and for the @xmath59 modes , see the next section ) .",
    "nevertheless , the spherical symmetry implies that there always exists an innermost point , called the internal turning point @xmath89 , the location where the radial component of the wave vector vanishes .",
    "and , when studying only the radial part , we need to determine this internal turning point and the phase condition there . for non - radial modes ,",
    "i.e. with @xmath24 and @xmath108 , @xmath89 is given by @xmath109    when the gravitational contribution is neglected ( @xmath110 ) , the expression ( [ r1cond_lneq0 ] ) is reduced to the well known one used in the context of current asymptotic approximations @xmath111    some turning points can already be seen on figure [ fig_ex_r2 ] where @xmath112 .",
    "it is also interesting to represent the right or left member of equation ( [ r1cond_lneq0 ] ) as a function of the radius ( figure [ fig_r1cond ] for the sun ) , so that @xmath89 can be immediately determined once the frequency and the degree of a mode are known . for a given @xmath56 , the larger the degree , the less",
    "the mode goes deep . for a given degree ,",
    "the larger the @xmath56 , the deeper the mode goes . for the degrees @xmath113 ,",
    "the curves begin to merge together with that where @xmath110 , which is independent of @xmath24 . for the smaller degrees ,",
    "the difference with the case without gravity is appreciable , even far from the centre , until the middle of the solar radius , because while @xmath18 decreases with the radius , @xmath114 decreases also quickly .",
    "the curve for the @xmath115 modes present a further special feature : the gravitation term becomes much more important compared to @xmath114 , so that a gap appears in the radiative zone , separating the curve into 2 parts , and for the concerned frequencies , the outermost turning point @xmath116 is drastically reduced to 0.137 instead of 1 for the other degrees .",
    "the turning points @xmath116 are given in table [ table_r1 ] for different @xmath24 values at typical levels of @xmath117 , to be compared to the case without gravity to appreciate the contribution of gravity for the sun .",
    "@xmath118    globally , when the gravitational potential is taken into account , @xmath89 is smaller , especially for @xmath115 .",
    "gravity pulls the low @xmath24 modes toward the centre .",
    "the location of the internal turning point can be directly determined by a mathematical expression , while the phase condition at this point is less easy to find out .",
    "a discussion about @xmath12 like at the surface is of no use because here its projection on the propagation direction vanishes .",

    "a well known method to bypass this difficulty is to develop linearly @xmath82 around @xmath89 @xmath123 and to adopt a new variable @xmath124 @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the derivative of @xmath82 in @xmath89 .",

    "the next step is to fit the two solutions ( [ p_standing_sol ] ) and ( [ p(x)_airy_sol ] ) at a fit location @xmath132 .",
    "this latter is usually chosen so that the corresponding @xmath133 is very large , in order to use the asymptotic development of ai which is sinusoidal , and to deduce easily the wave phase . in fact , this method introduces an important lack of precision because the airy solution is only valid when ( [ kr2lin ] ) is valid , that is around @xmath134 .",
    "we will here adopt fitting points @xmath132 that are a priori not far from @xmath89 , corresponding to small values of @xmath133 .",

    "this matching has only a sense when equation ( [ kr2lin ] ) can be used . applying this latter and equation ( [ x_definition ] ) ,",
    "then calculating the first and third integrals of equation ( [ alpha_pi ] ) , the final expression of @xmath93 can be expressed as a function of @xmath133 : @xmath143   \\right\\}+\\frac{2}{3}x_f^{3/2}.\\ ] ]    it remains now to determine the fitting point .",
    "it should be chosen at the farthest limit toward @xmath89 where the jwkb solution is still valid , to be also in the validation domain of the airy solution . as seen in appendix [ the jwkb approach ] , the jwkb method is valid as long as the derivative of @xmath48 is enough small compared to @xmath48 : @xmath144 where a is a ` small ' number . in other words ,",
    "the variation of @xmath36 must be slow enough on a wavelength when @xmath48 goes to zero .",
    "this condition should be coherent with that at the external limit which is of the same nature ( eq . [ prop_cond ] ) , except that the characteristic scale height @xmath145 to be considered here does not come from the environment but from the function @xmath36 itself .",
    "we can define a function f @xmath146 and should use the already determined coefficient @xmath99 to write the condition @xmath147 with @xmath148 the searched condition ( [ jwkb_cond_principe ] ) is thus @xmath149 using equation ( [ kr2lin ] ) , a first fitting point can then be obtained @xmath150 imposing that the ratio @xmath151 is enough small , the condition ( [ jwkb_cond_final ] ) is in fact not sufficient to warranty the validity of the standing wave solution .",
    "when @xmath24 and @xmath92 are small , the slope @xmath126 of the function @xmath82 can be so close to zero that @xmath82 will also remains very close to zero .",
    "the wave solution loose its meaning because the wavelength becomes too large .",
    "either @xmath126 or @xmath82 , or their product should be enough large .",
    "the smallest @xmath48 is determined by the largest wavelength that can be contained in the cavity : @xmath152 the smallest slope @xmath126 should be so that @xmath48 reaches an ` appreciable ' value , let us say corresponding to @xmath153 , on a ` negligible ' distance , i.e. a distance @xmath154 small enough compared to the wavelength . to be coherent with above ,",
    "we use again the coefficient @xmath99 and the relation ( [ prop_cond ] ) with the inverse inequality sign @xmath155 that leads to @xmath156 which , together with equation ( [ kr_limit ] ) allow to arrive to the searched condition on the product @xmath157 @xmath158 using equation ( [ kr2lin ] ) , the second fitting point can be obtained @xmath159 the final fitting point can be taken as a compromise between the conditions ( [ jwkb_cond_final ] ) and ( [ kr2k1_limit ] ) , that is a mean value between @xmath160 and @xmath161 @xmath162    everything is now ready for the complete calculation of the @xmath163 modes .      for the radial modes @xmath164",
    "there is _ a priori _ no turning point as for @xmath106 .",
    "it is very tempting to conclude that these modes pass through the star center which is a node , since due to symmetrical reasons it must stay immobile . in this case : @xmath165 but this induces eigenfrequencies that are lower than numerical or observed results by several tens of @xmath1hz . in fact , no mode can touch the center : the linear solution of local wave can not be applied at @xmath166 . for a spherical wave ,",
    "it is obvious that the center is a singular point according to its expression ( [ standing_wave ] ) .",
    "the wave must be stopped somewhere before reaching the center .",
    "as the perturbed pressure @xmath20 goes to infinity , for the wave , everything happens as if the surrounding pressure goes to zero . and everything looks like the vacuum condition at the external limit , except that here the decreasing ` external ' pressure is directly given by a law in @xmath167 .",
    "thus @xmath168 , and the condition ( [ prop_cond ] ) gives the turning point @xmath89 @xmath169 taking into account the numerical value of @xmath99 ( eq . [ av ] ) , this relation can be written as @xmath170 when neglecting the gravity , this formula is very close to that using by traditional approximations where the term @xmath57 is artificially replaced by @xmath58 . therefore , the present concept of ` vacuum condition ' characterised by the coefficient @xmath99 , could be considered as the justification of this usual way of doing for @xmath59 .",
    "equation ( [ r1_l=0_num ] ) can also be rewritten in a general form like equation ( [ r1cond_lneq0 ] ) : @xmath171 this expression is also represented in figure [ fig_r1cond ] giving the internal turning point .",
    "the curve features an important gap in the radiative zone , even bigger than for the @xmath115 modes , and for the concerned frequencies the largest possible @xmath172 can only go up to 0.035 .",
    "the internal turning point being determined , let us examine the phase at this location .",
    "whenever the gravity is neglected , we are in the same ` vacuum ' type condition than at the external boundary ( eq . [ vacuum_cond ] ) : the standing wave will present a pressure node or a displacement antinode .",
    "thus , in this case @xmath173    in the presence of a gravity field , the condition ( [ vacuum_cond_under_gravity ] ) must be rather applied , which can be rewritten as @xmath174 as @xmath89 is very near the center , the exact solution of @xmath175 must be used . indeed ,",
    "resulting from poisson s equation , the gravitational potential as well as its perturbation must remain always finite , even at the center .",
    "going back to equation ( [ acous_eq_4 ] ) , and with @xmath176 , the equation that has to be solved is @xmath177 to the particular solution given by equation ( [ phi_sol ] ) , must be added the homogeneous solution @xmath178 with c , d the constants to be determined . in order to have a negligible gravitational potential at large radius , @xmath179 must be chosen . and",
    "for @xmath59 , d must be chosen so that the general solution is @xmath180.\\ ] ] this keeps @xmath175 finite at @xmath166 .",
    "equation ( [ p1+rophi=0 ] ) becomes , for the corresponding standing waves @xmath181 knowing that @xmath182 with @xmath140 the location of the closest node to @xmath89 , and @xmath183 where the terms @xmath184 inside the integral signs are implicit , the equation determining @xmath185 can be deduced @xmath186 as generally @xmath187 , this can be simplified to : @xmath188 as very near the center the wave number @xmath8 can be considered to be roughly constant , @xmath189 a further simplified expression for @xmath93 can be used @xmath190 when the gravity potential is neglected ( @xmath191 ) , this expression is coherent with equation ( [ alpha=0 ] ) .",
    "we have now every ingredient to calculate the eigenfrequencies . it is worth gathering here the whole set of equations used for the general case in the presence of gravity . given the 2 parameters @xmath24 , @xmath92 which are respectively the mode degree and order , a system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns @xmath56 and @xmath93 has to be solved : @xmath192 and for @xmath106 @xmath193   \\right\\}+\\frac{2}{3}x_f^{3/2}\\ ] ] for @xmath59 @xmath194 with @xmath195 @xmath89 is given by @xmath196 and @xmath90 given by @xmath197 with @xmath198 @xmath133 is given by @xmath199 where @xmath126 is the derivative of @xmath82 at @xmath89 , and @xmath132 is given by @xmath200    equations ( [ whole_set_duvall]-[whole_set_rf ] ) are the only equations needed for the frequency determination .",
    "this shows the simplicity of the present approach .",
    "three functions of the equilibrium structure are directly involved , @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "@xmath203 is in fact only important at the surface in the determination of @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath202 contributes via the gravitational potential , which plays a crucial role toward the center , being more important for lower degree modes .",
    "one can also notice the presence of the coefficient @xmath99 at external as wel as internal limit conditions .",
    "determined initially by a ` vacuum ' condition at the surface , it turns to play a key role in the study of the validity of the jwkb solution in general .",
    "the above equations are obtained without neglecting the gravity effect .",
    "the induced results in the following sections will thus present the same quality at low as well as at large degree or order , except when deliberately ignoring the gravity term .    in the following ,",
    "the results obtained with the above equations are exposed and commented , for the modes @xmath59 to 10 , and frequencies in the range 300 - 5600 @xmath1hz , firstly for the case without gravity , and secondly in the general case taken into account the gravity .",
    "although neglecting the gravity is a crude approximation , it is very instructive because the corresponding physical conditions look like those of acoustic waves on earth , which appear more familiar to us .",
    "furthermore , that will allow direct comparisons with the existing semi - analytical approaches where the gravity effect is neglected or treated at the second order .",
    "we employ the equations ( [ whole_set_duvall]-[whole_set_rf ] ) with @xmath191 .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ fig_r1_r2_alpha_nu - nunum_asymp ] for the turning points @xmath89 , @xmath90 , the phase shift @xmath93 and the difference @xmath204 between the eigenfrequencies resulting from the present work and those computed numerically ( the numerical calculation automatically takes into account perturbation on gravity ) .",
