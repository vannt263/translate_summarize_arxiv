    "<S> measured widths increase for stronger interaction strengths ( smaller @xmath79 ) and are larger for the repulsive branch than for the attractive branch . </S>",
    "<S> while the spectral width contains information about the polaron lifetime , there are several experimental factors that can also contribute to broadening . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that density inhomogeneity introduces broadening by up to 15 percent of the shift at the center of the polaron peak , @xmath61 . beyond this </S>",
    "<S> , the rf spectra could additionally be broadened by intrinsic many - body effects and the thermal momentum distribution of impurities . </S>",
    "<S> it must be acknowledged , however , that if this unaccounted - for width gives rise to asymmetric lineshapes , there will be systematic errors in our energy determination . </S>",
    "<S> the excess broadening , in any case , gives a lower limit on the polaron lifetime , which is still longer than the quasiparticle s inverse energy . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the bose polaron is a well - defined quasiparticle .    </S>",
    "<S> this first measurement of the bose polaron in a three - dimensional trapped atom gas probed the energies and lifetimes for both the attractive and repulsive branches . </S>",
    "<S> a future direction would be to probe other basic quasiparticle properties , such as the quasiparticle s effective mass and residue . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it would be interesting to explore the dependence of the excitation spectrum on temperature , both theoretically and experimentally . in our case , by probing impurities in the central region of the bec , the effective temperature of the bosons should be very close to zero . finally , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite theoretically considers the effect of efimov trimers on the bose polaron . </S>",
    "<S> however , for our system , the location of the efimov resonance is predicted to be @xmath80 @xcite , such that efimov effects on the bose polaron would only occur in an extremely narrow regime of small @xmath79 that we do not resolve . </S>",
    "<S> experimental investigation of efimov effects on the bose polaron would thus require a different atomic system with a more favorable three - body interaction parameter .    </S>",
