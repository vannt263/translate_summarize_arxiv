    "<S> the oscillations are periodic in @xmath190 and are governed by the ratio @xmath191 where the expression for the hall frequency @xmath192 and a simple explanation of the oscillation pattern follows from the analysis of the structure of @xmath193 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ corriente ] ) . for this purpose </S>",

    "<S> the momentum transfer @xmath196 is equivalent to a hopping or shifting of the guiding center @xmath197 . </S>",
    "<S> an estimation of the momentum transfer @xmath198 can be obtained from the overlap of the wave functions between the @xmath64 and @xmath141 ll . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap , obtained in section [ curr ] is proportional to the function @xmath199 eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : consenergia ] ) the following selection rule is obtained @xmath204 in hiro we are interested in large ll ; so we consider contributions from states that are close to the fermi level , that is far away from the dirac point , so @xmath205 as we assume that @xmath206 we write @xmath207 and @xmath208 , with @xmath209 . </S>",

    "<S> we recall that , even though the linear spectrum in graphene implies zero rest mass , their cyclotron mass is not zero , but it is given as@xcite @xmath212 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , using the definition of the cyclotron frequency , @xmath213 , the resonance condition can be written as @xmath214 the hiro oscillations are periodic in @xmath190 , according to the condition ( [ eq : resohall ] ) resistance maxima are expected at integer values of the dimensionless parameter @xmath191 . </S>",

    "<S> hence we find that the leading oscillation frequency of the periodic potential , is precisely the hall frequency @xmath220 , given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : resohall ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to observe that from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : consenergia ] ) the hopping distance for a resonant transition between ll is expressed as    @xmath221    that depends both on the magnetic field and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation can be interpreted as a selection rule that determines @xmath222 for arbitrary transition between ll . </S>",
    "<S> if we now consider the limit of large ll levels , the selection rule reduces to @xmath223 which does not depend on @xmath181 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is similar to the selection rule @xmath224 found by yang @xmath225 @xcite in their study of hiro in 2deg .    to acquire a deeper insight on the experimental parameters required to obtain the hiro , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hiro-3 ] ) the differential resistance is plotted as a function of @xmath190 for three values of the dimensionless broadening parameters @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 , that corresponds to a reduction of the mobility by a factor of 2 and 3 . clearly , the hiro amplitude are strongly suppressed as @xmath33 increases . </S>",
    "<S> although in the first case the hiro are clearly identified , an small reduction of the mobility sweeps most of the oscillation . </S>",
