    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of dilute atomic gases @xcite is one of the most fundamental developments in quantum and atomic physics over the last two decades .",
    "many of the relevant theoretical and experimental studies @xcite have been focused on the nonlinear excitations of becs @xcite . among them , the so - called _ matter - wave dark solitons _ ( see the recent review @xcite ) , namely localized density dips with a phase - jump across them , have been observed in becs in a series of experiments @xcite .",
    "the interest on this type of localized nonlinear structures may be attributed to a series of reasons : matter - wave dark solitons are one of the most fundamental nonlinear excitations of becs with repulsive interatomic interactions , being the nonlinear analogs of the excited eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite ; furthermore , they arise spontaneously upon crossing the bec phase - transition @xcite , and their properties may be used as a diagnostic tool probing the rich physics of becs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , matter - wave dark solitons may also be relevant to applications : for example , it has been proposed that the position of a dark soliton can be used to monitor the phase acquired in an atomic matter - wave interferometer in the nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "matter - wave dark solitons have been generated in atomic becs by means of various different methods .",
    "in particular , in the early experiments @xcite ( but also in some recent ones @xcite ) , dark solitons were created by means of the _ phase - imprinting method _ :",
    "this technique relies on the illumination of part of the condensate by a short off - resonance laser beam , so as to imprint the necessary phase jump characterizing the dark soliton .",
    "another technique , that was used in the experiments reported in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) is the _ density - engineering method _ , which is based on the creation of local density depletion on the bec density by means of external potentials .",
    "a combination of the phase - imprinting and density - engineering methods , namely the so - called _ quantum - state engineering _ technique is also possible : this method involves manipulation of both the bec density and phase , and has also been used in experiments with two - component becs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bec flow against a broad penetrable barrier , which was swept through the condensate , led to the breakup of the bec superfluidity and the concomitant generation of dark solitons for a particular regime of barrier speeds . finally , in more recent experiments the the interference between two ( or more ) condensate fragments confined in a trap was demonstrated to result in the formation of dark solitons @xcite , or vortices in higher - dimensional setups @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose an alternative method to create dark solitons in quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) becs , or vortices in higher - dimensional settings ( particularly , in quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) becs ) .",
    "the proposed technique relies on the manipulation of the @xmath0-wave scattering length , which controls the effective nonlinear coefficient in the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) mean - field model : in particular , we consider a situation where the collisional dynamics across the condensate is inhomogeneous due to the presence of a spatially dependent external field in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance .",
    "note that such , so - called , _ collisionally inhomogeneous condensates _",
    "@xcite , have attracted much attention , as they have been proved to provide a variety of interesting phenomena @xcite . in the present study , we assume , more specifically , that by switching - on an external magnetic or optical field , the nonlinear coefficient becomes piecewise constant ( in line with the considerations of @xcite ) , and can vary between two ( smoothly connected ) values . then , depending on the magnitude of the jump in the value of the nonlinear coefficient , one or more dark solitons in the 1d setting , or vortices in the 2d setting , can controllably be created .",
    "it is important to note that the considered form of the spatial change of the nonlinear coefficient ( i.e. , of the @xmath0-wave scattering length ) may be straightforwardly experimentally realizable , through the use of magnetic field gradients of moderate size for atom chips ( see also discussion in ref .",
    "it should also be added that a similar technique has been proposed very recently in the three - dimensional context as a means of generating vortex rings @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ 1d ] we present our model and discuss the dark soliton generation in the quasi-1d setting . in sec .",
    "[ 2d ] we present results concerning the soliton generation , as well as their subsequent decay into vortices , in the quasi-2d setting and , finally , in sec .",
    "[ conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a cigar - shaped ( quasi-1d ) condensate , confined in an anisotropic trap with longitudinal and transverse confining frequencies ( denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ) such that @xmath3 . in this case , taking also into regard the quasi - one - dimensional nature of the dynamics , it can be found @xcite that the condensate evolution can be described by an effectively 1d , gp - like equation which can be expressed in the following dimensionless form : @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the macroscopic wave function , normalized so that @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the number of atoms ) , @xmath8 is the chemical potential , while the density @xmath9 , the length , time and energy are measured , respectively , in units of @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the @xmath0-wave scattering length ) , the transverse harmonic oscillator length @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "note that the deviation from 1d is accounted for by the generalized nonlinearity in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , which becomes the traditional cubic nonlinearity in the weakly - interacting limit of @xmath15 ( in this limit , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is reduced to the usual 1d gp equation  see , e.g. , discussion in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the potential @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is assumed to have the usual harmonic form , @xmath17 characterized by its strength @xmath18 . finally , as concerns the nonlinear coefficient @xmath19 , it is considered to be of the following form : @xmath20 \\big\\ } \\big\\ { \\frac{1}{2}\\big[1+\\tanh\\big(\\frac{t - t_{0}}{\\tau}\\big)\\big ] \\big\\ } + 1 , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where the spatial and temporal scales @xmath0 and @xmath21 , the characteristic time @xmath22 , and the constant @xmath23 , are defined below , upon considering various asymptotic limits associated to the assumed form of @xmath24 . in particular , in order to better understand the physical situation described by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , let us first consider the asymptotic limit of @xmath25 : in this case , eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) describes a condensate with a constant nonlinear coefficient equal to @xmath26 . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath27 , the nonlinearity coefficient asymptotes to the spatially dependent form @xmath28 + 1 $ ]",
    "; this suggests , in turn , that for @xmath29 the nonlinearity coefficient takes the values @xmath26 and @xmath30 , respectively . in other words ,",
    "the condensate is initially ( @xmath25 ) characterized by a constant nonlinear coefficient @xmath26 , but for large times ( @xmath27 ) the implementation of a temporal smooth ramp renders the nonlinear coefficient spatially inhomogeneous , experiencing a smooth jump , from @xmath30 to @xmath26 , around the trap center ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "according to the above , it is clear that @xmath23 denotes the amplitude of the jump in the value of the nonlinear coefficient , @xmath0 is the spatial length scale on which the transition between the values @xmath26 and @xmath30 takes place , @xmath22 represents the characteristic time around which the spatial inhomogeneity of the nonlinear coefficient is `` switched - on '' , while the time scale @xmath21 is the duration of this process .    from a physical point of view",
    ", the above situation may be implemented experimentally as follows .",
    "first , the modification of the nonlinear coefficient @xmath19  i.e. , of the scattering length @xmath11  from the value @xmath26 to the value @xmath30 can be achieved by using an external magnetic ( or optical ) field , which is realized around @xmath32 .",
    "the desired inhomogeneity of the scattering length may be realized upon employing a bias homogeneous external field and imposing on top of it a steep localized spatial gradient .",
    "this leads to a constant scattering length in the left portion of the condensate ( @xmath33 ) , followed by a localized change of @xmath11 , ending up with a different value in the right portion of the condensate ( @xmath34 ) . in our consideration",
    ", we choose the function @xmath35 to mathematically characterize the switch - on of the external fields , as well as the transition between the different constant values of @xmath11 . also , it is natural to assume that we are relatively close to a feshbach resonance , so as to easily manipulate the scattering length with the imposed external field .",
    "let us now proceed with the presentation of our numerical results demonstrating the dark soliton generation in the 1d setting considered above .",
    "the numerical simulations start with the determination of the stationary ground state of the system , obtained by means of newton s method , with an initial condition corresponding to the value @xmath26 of the nonlinear coefficient .",
    "then , the dynamical evolution of the system is monitored by a 4th - order runge - kutta method , with step @xmath36 . in the results presented below",
    ", the parameters are chosen as : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "notice that for the generation of dark solitons , the values of the chemical potential and of the jump of the nonlinearity coefficient ( described by the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath8 , respectively ) are of crucial importance .     of the condensate , as per eq.([eq1 ] ) , with fixed chemical potential ( @xmath41 ) and different values of the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath42 dark solitons are not generated , while as the value of @xmath23 is increased , the formation of @xmath43 solitons is observed for @xmath44 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ] of the condensate , as per eq.([eq1 ] ) , with fixed chemical potential ( @xmath41 ) and different values of the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath42 dark solitons are not generated , while as the value of @xmath23 is increased , the formation of @xmath43 solitons is observed for @xmath44 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where some typical scenarios of the evolution are shown , we keep the value of the chemical potential fixed , namely @xmath41 , and investigate how the value of @xmath23 affects this process .",
    "we observe , at first , that dark solitons are not formed for sufficiently small values of @xmath23 ; a pertinent example , corresponding to @xmath42 , is provided in the top - left panel of the figure . on the other hand , the increase of the value of @xmath23 results in the formation of dark solitons .",
    "the top - middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that a dark soliton is emitted forwardly ( i.e. , toward the right portion of the bec , with the smaller value of the scattering length ) at about @xmath45 when @xmath46 ; similarly , the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the emergence of two solitons , for @xmath47 , and so on ( see a more detailed analysis below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] also demonstrates the basic features of the condensate and soliton dynamics . in that regard , first we note that the switch - on ( around @xmath48 ) of the external potential modifying the spatial distribution of the nonlinear coefficient , results in the excitation of the quadrupole mode of the condensate @xcite . in particular , after @xmath49 , the condensate shows a breathing behavior , performing the quadrupole oscillation with a characteristic frequency close to the value @xmath50 @xcite . on the other hand , the dark solitons , when formed , perform oscillations due to the external potential . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , dark solitons with sufficiently large velocities are transmitted through the `` interface '' at the trap center ( @xmath31 ) , while lower velocity solitons are chiefly reflected by the interface .",
    "moreover , it can readily be observed that in cases where more than two solitons are formed , they may undergo elastic collisions : see , e.g. , the third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( for @xmath51 ) , where the solitons collide at @xmath52 .",
    "similar events arise in cases where more solitons are generated .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the soliton generation ( and subsequent evolution ) is followed by emission of radiation of weak linear ( sound ) waves , which are originally generated in the left portion of the bec ( with the larger value of the scattering length ) , but then travel in the whole system .    at this point , it is necessary to mention that the emergence of solitons is a continuous process . in particular ,",
    "instead of emerging only for a specific value of @xmath23 , the density of a dark soliton becomes deeper as @xmath23 increases and , meanwhile , the phase dislocation increases also , being associated with the presence of the dark soliton .",
    "thus , if a dark soliton is formed for a given value of @xmath23 , the same soliton tends to appear earlier as @xmath23 is increased . due to the gradual character of this process",
    ", it is difficult to quantitatively identify the emergence of the soliton(s ) .",
    "nevertheless , our rule of identification is set in the way that , if a dark soliton is emitted forwardly ( @xmath34 ) before @xmath53 , then it is counted .",
    "this is how we determine the number of solitons as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    as mentioned before , besides @xmath23 , the chemical potential @xmath8 is another factor which is important for the soliton formation .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] demonstrates the joint influence of these two parameters .",
    "the increase of each parameter has a positive effect on the system s capability of emitting solitons . in particular , the larger the value of @xmath8 is , the smaller the value of @xmath23 at which dark solitons may be generated .",
    "for instance , applying the identification rule stated before , the second soliton emerges when @xmath54 for @xmath55 , or when @xmath56 for @xmath57 , and so on ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .    , according to the identification rule defined in section [ 1d ] , as a step function of @xmath23 for different values of the chemical potential @xmath8 .",
    "the five functions with various colors and line types represent five different cases chosen as example , i.e. , @xmath58 . ]",
    "we have also studied the 2d setting , corresponding to the case of the so - called disk - shaped becs . in this case",
    ", the evolution of the bec will be described by the pertinent gp equation with the cubic nonlinearity @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the wave function , @xmath61 is the harmonic potential with @xmath62 , and the laplacian @xmath63 .",
    "the nonlinear coefficient @xmath19 is assumed to take the same form , as in the 1d setting , indicating that the spatial inhomogeneity is employed along the @xmath64-axis .    as before , we start the simulations with the steady state of the system , corresponding to @xmath26 . the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath65 and @xmath21 remain the same as in the 1d setting .",
    "during the evolution , dark solitons are emitted when the amplitude @xmath23 and chemical potential @xmath8 are sufficiently large .",
    "moreover , another parameter is found to play an important role in this process , namely the normalized strength @xmath66 of the trapping potential @xmath67 . in the numerical results of this section",
    ", @xmath8 is fixed to @xmath68 , as its influence on the dark soliton has been discussed in detail in the 1d case , and we focus on cases with various pairs of @xmath66 and @xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] describes a typical evolution scenario , by showing snapshots of the bec density for @xmath69 and @xmath70 . starting with a stationary ground state ( similarly to the 1d case )",
    ", the condensate becomes anisotropic due to the change of the value of the nonlinear coefficient ; a rectilinear dark soliton is generated near the line @xmath31 , and then it moves to the forward direction ( @xmath34 ) , as shown in the top panels of the figure .",
    "subsequently , this rectilinear dark soliton does not oscillate as it does in the 1d setting ; instead , it undergoes a bending and , after moving forward for a short time , it finally breaks up into a sequence of vortex pairs , as a result of the onset of the snaking instability ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein , as well as @xcite for relevant experimental observations )  see the middle row of fig .",
    "the generated vortices are moving due to their interactions and the action of the external potential , and some of them disappear at later times .",
    "it is also worth observing ( see the bottom row of fig .",
