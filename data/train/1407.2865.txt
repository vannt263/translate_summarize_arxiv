    "pi mesons hold a special place in both the weak and the strong interactions , and remain subjects of research interest ever since their discovery almost 70 years ago @xcite .",
    "historically , pion decay has provided an important testing ground for the weak interaction and radiative corrections from the earliest time of the development of modern particle theory .",
    "decays of the charged pion proceed via the weak interaction , and therefore closely reflect its properties and dynamics .",
    "in particular , the suppression of the direct electronic decay of the pion ( @xmath10 , or @xmath1 ) , manifested in the failure of initial searches to observe it , led to an early examination of the nature of the weak interaction governing pion decay @xcite .",
    "a low branching fraction of @xmath11 was predicted @xcite even before the decay s discovery @xcite , as a direct consequence of the @xmath12@xmath13@xmath14  nature of the weak interaction , through helicity suppression of the right - handed state of the electron .",
    "not only was this prediction confirmed by the early measurements @xcite , the size of the radiative corrections @xcite was soon proved correct as well @xcite .    in more recent times",
    "pion decays have been theoretically described with extraordinary precision .",
    "thanks to the underlying symmetries and the associated conservation laws , the more complicated and thus more uncertain hadronic processes are suppressed .",
    "if measured with precision comparable to that of their theoretical description , pion decays offer an outstanding , clean testing ground of universality of lepton and quark couplings .",
    "any documented deviation from standard model expectations would indicate presence of dynamics not included in the sm , affecting pion decays through loop diagrams .    in the hadronic sector",
    "the pion plays the role of the long - range exchange particle in effective nucleon - nucleon lagrangians .",
    "just as importantly , the pion also plays the role of the pseudo - goldstone boson in the breaking of chiral symmetry for hadrons @xcite .",
    "whereas early formulations of the phenomenon were focusing on nucleons as the fundamental hadronic fermions , the concept remains valid in the quark picture .",
    "while a massless pion would suffice to account for the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , the nonzero pion mass @xcite can be related directly to the light quark masses within the framework of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking , particularly in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "although in principle the full theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) contains all of this physics , in practice qcd does not readily provide manageable calculations in the low energy , nonperturbative domain .",
    "the situation will improve in the near future as lattice qcd calculations continue to increase accuracy , reliability and reach .",
    "thus , for a long time chiral perturbation theory and other similar effective lagrangian approximate methods have provided the primary and the only practical systematic treatment of low energy hadronic processes based on qcd .",
    "basic properties of the pion , such as its charge radius and form factors , are closely related to the constants of the chiral lagrangian @xcite and are thus fundamental to nonperturbative qcd calculations .    in the remainder of this work we review experimental studies of individual rare decay modes of the charged pion in the order of descending branching fraction , with a focus on recent and ongoing experiments .",
    "it is worth noting that almost all measurements to date have studied the positive pion .",
    "stopped @xmath15 mesons are captured with high probability in target nuclei ( and undergo strong interactions ) , leaving few , if any , pions to decay weakly .",
    "hence , in practice @xmath15 decays can only be studied in flight in vacuo , with typically a tiny fraction of the beam pions decaying in the apparatus , and the remaining pions escaping before decaying .",
    "positive pions can be easily stopped in a designated target , with a small fraction lost through prompt hadronic reactions with matter required to stop the beam .",
    "the stopped @xmath16 s decay with an exponential time distribution governed by the 26ns pion lifetime .",
    "the dominant decay mode is @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) which will not be discussed here .",
    "the resulting 4.1mev muons are typically contained in the target and decay via the @xmath19 process with @xmath20s .",
    "the @xmath21 ( or , equivalently , @xmath22 ) decay connects a pseudoscalar @xmath23 state ( the pion ) to the vacuum . at the lowest , tree level , the ratio of the @xmath24 to @xmath25 decay widths is given by @xcite @xmath26 the first factor in the above expression , the ratio of squared lepton masses for the two decays , comes from the helicity suppression by the @xmath12@xmath13@xmath14  lepton-@xmath27 boson weak couplings . if , instead , the decay could proceed directly through the pseudoscalar current , the ratio @xmath28 would reduce to the second , phase - space factor , or approximately 5.5 .",
    "more complete treatment of the process includes @xmath29 , the radiative and loop corrections , and the possibility of lepton universality violation , i.e. , that @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the electron and muon couplings to the @xmath27 , respectively , may not be equal : @xmath32 where the `` @xmath33 '' indicates that radiative decays are fully included in the branching fractions .",
    "steady improvements of the theoretical description of the @xmath1 decay since the 1950 s have recently culminated in a series of calculations that have refined the standard model ( sm ) prediction to a precision of 8 parts in @xmath34 : @xmath35 a comparison with equation reveals that the radiative and loop corrections amount to almost 4% of @xmath36 . however , as discussed below , the experimental precision at this time lags behind the theoretical one by more than an order of magnitude .    because of the large helicity suppression of the @xmath1  decay , its branching ratio is highly susceptible to small non-@xmath12@xmath13@xmath14  contributions from new physics , making this decay a particularly suitable subject of study , as discussed in , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "this prospect provides the primary motivation for the ongoing pen@xcite and pienu@xcite experiments . of the possible `` new physics '' contributions in the lagrangian ,",
    "@xmath1  is directly sensitive to the pseudoscalar one . at the precision of @xmath37",
    ", @xmath28 probes the pseudoscalar and axial vector mass scales up to 1,000tev and 20tev , respectively@xcite . for comparison , cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix unitarity and precise measurements of several superallowed nuclear beta decays constrain the non - sm vector contributions to @xmath38tev , and scalar to @xmath39tev @xcite .",
    "although scalar interactions do not directly contribute to @xmath28 , they can do so through loop diagrams , resulting in sensitivity to new scalar interactions up to 60tev @xcite .",
    "the subject was recently reviewed at length in ref .",
    "in addition , @xmath40 provides limits on masses of certain susy partners@xcite , and on neutrino sector anomalies@xcite .      even though @xmath36 is small , of order @xmath41",
    ", it would be relatively straightforward to measure precisely because of the large difference in decay ejectile energies , 69.79mev vs. 4.12mev for the @xmath42 and @xmath43 channels , respectively .",
    "however , the subsequent decay of the muon , @xmath44 , with the endpoint energy of 52.83mev , effectively brings the two processes kinematically closer , making the clean identification of the direct @xmath45 events challenging in a `` tail '' overlap region discussed below .",
    "this complication is partly mitigated by the @xmath46 times longer lifetime of the muon than that of the pion . selecting only early decays , say , within a couple of pion lifetimes ,",
    "suppresses the sequential @xmath47 events by more than an order of magnitude , thus effectively enhancing the apparent @xmath48 branching ratio .",
    "nearly all experiments to date have used a variant of the stopped pion decay technique to measure @xmath36 .",
    "the technique based on detecting and normalizing @xmath49 to @xmath47 decays at rest in a nonmagnetic spectrometer is inherently independent of several important sources of systematic uncertainty that are shared by the two processes , and that consequently cancel in the ratio .",
    "prime examples of shared uncertainties that cancel include the relative placement of the target and the positron detector and the resulting acceptance .",
    "( on the other hand , using a magnetic spectrometer removes this insensitivity , as it would introduce a strong dependence of the solid angle on @xmath50 momentum . )",
    "further cancellations occur for the efficiency of positron detection ( largely independent of @xmath51 , although corrections at the @xmath37@xmath52 level are typically needed ) , various beam properties , efficiency of pion stop identification in the target , overall trigger efficiency etc .",
    "all of these quantities would have to be determined with higher precision in an experiment that would normalize the detected @xmath1  decay events to the corresponding number of beam pions stopped in the target .",
    "additional quantities such as the time displacement of the first detection interval from the arrival time of the pion and duration of the detection time gate , affect the extraction of @xmath36 in well understood ways .",
    "the first notable measurement of @xmath36 with 6% uncertainty ( rather than an upper limit or detection of a small number of @xmath1decay events ) , was performed by the university of chicago group with positive pions stopped inside a double - focusing magnetic spectrometer @xcite .",
    "this work was soon followed by a @xmath53% measurement @xcite at the columbia nevis synchrocyclotron laboratory ; decay positrons from @xmath16 s stopped in an active target were detected in a 23@xmath5424 cm nai(tl ) detector .",
    "given the nai detector size and acceptance for photons , the analysis included low-@xmath55 inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) radiative @xmath56 events in the branching fraction , in accordance with the theoretical definition of @xmath36 , as given in .",
    "the nevis measurement brought to light an important experimental uncertainty , related to how accurately the nai(tl ) energy response function is known .",
    "positrons in the few to a hundred mev energy range generate electromagnetic showers that can not be completely contained in a finite - sized physical detector volume ; there is a non - zero probability that some energy will escape the volume , primarily in the form of photons , inducing a low - energy `` tail '' in the response function to a monoenergetic positron .",
    "( use of a magnetic spectrometer would eliminate this problem , though at the cost of significantly more complicated acceptance systematics . )",
    "this intrinsic instrumental tail coexists with the physical `` tail '' of radiative decay events for which the accompanying photon escaped detection , primarily due to limited detector solid angle .",
    "we note in passing that in a nearly hermetic detector , radiative decays will generate a high energy `` tail '' extending above the @xmath5769.8mev two - body decay positron energy ; this was not a feature of the early measurements . in a sufficiently segmented detector",
    "such events can be properly treated by analyzing @xmath58 rather than @xmath59 alone .",
    "the tail correction for @xmath10 events falling below the @xmath43 decay endpoint energy in the nevis experiment was 9.1% with a @xmath570.7% combined systematic and statistical uncertainty . while this correction diminishes for larger detectors , especially with external active enclosures , it remains a dominant source of systematic uncertainty for @xmath36 , especially as experiments approach the theoretical precision of equation .",
    "the triumf group of bryman and collaborators @xcite used a similar technique to that used in the nevis measurement , with improvements .",
    "tina , the triumf nai(tl ) detector was larger at 46 cm @xmath60 51 cm long , and subtended a solid angle of @xmath61% of @xmath62sr , with energy resolution of about 4% full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) at 70mev , almost four times better than the nevis detector s @xmath5715% .",
    "the experiment collected approximately @xmath63 @xmath1  decay events .",
    "the resulting branching ratio had a 1.2% overall uncertainty .",
    "the single largest contribution to the uncertainty , at 0.75% , arose from the tail correction .",
    "tina was used again in a follow - up measurement ( )        by the same group @xcite , with numerous improvements in experimental design including an increased solid angle coverage of 2.9% of @xmath62sr and an order of magnitude more detected @xmath1  decay events . the measured branching fraction @xmath64        \\times 10^{-4 } \\",

    "psi setup is shown in .",
    "the key component of the        apparatus was a nearly hermetic @xmath65sr calorimeter consisting of 132 bismuth germanium oxide ( bgo ) detectors in the shape of hexagonal prisms , each 20 cm or 18 radiation lengths long , and with inscribed radius of 5.5 cm .",
    "the detectors were arranged so that a narrow opening allowed the beam ( almost equal parts pions and muons ) to stop in a small cylindrical plastic scintillator ( active target ) , whose light was read out by a central calorimeter crystal .",
    "the resulting rms resolution was sub-2% at 70mev . because of the hermetic nature of the calorimeter , radiative muon decays presented a significant background under the @xmath66 signal peak in the energy spectrum .",

    "the calorimeter consists of 240 truncated hexagonal and pentagonal pyramids of pure csi , 22 cm or 12 radiation lengths deep .",
    "the inner and outer diameters of the sphere are 52 cm and 96 cm , respectively .",
    "beam particles entering the apparatus with @xmath81mev/@xmath82 are first tagged in a thin upstream beam counter ( bc ) and refocused by a triplet of quadrupole magnets .",
    "after a @xmath83 m long flight path they pass through a 5 mm thick active degrader ( ad ) and a low - mass mini time projection chamber ( mtpc ) , finally to reach a 15 mm thick active target ( at ) where the beam pions stop .",
    "decay particles are tracked non - magnetically in a pair of concentric cylindrical multiwire proportional chambers ( mwpc1,2 ) and an array of twenty 4 mm thick plastic hodoscope detectors ( ph ) , all surrounding the active target .",
    "the bc , ad , at and ph detectors are all made of fast plastic scintillator material and read out by fast photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "signals from the beam detectors are sent to waveform digitizers , running at 2gs / s for bc , ad , and at , and at 250ms / s for the mtpc .",
    "as discussed in the preceding section , a key source of systematic uncertainty in previous @xmath1  experiments has been the hard to measure low energy tail of the detector response function , caused by electromagnetic shower leakage from the calorimeter , mostly in the form of photons .",
    "pen is no exception in this respect .",
    "other physical processes , if not properly identified and suppressed , also contribute events to the low energy part of the spectrum ; unlike shower leakage they can also produce high energy events .",
    "one process is ordinary pion decay into a muon in flight , before the pion is stopped , with the resulting muon decaying within the time gate accepted in the measurement .",
    "another is the unavoidable physical process of radiative decay .",
    "the latter is well measured and properly accounted for in the pen apparatus , as discussed below in the section on radiative decay .",
    "shower leakage and pion decays in flight can only be well characterized if the @xmath47 chain can be well separated from the direct @xmath45 decay in the target .",

    "the key to the method is provided by the beam and mwpc detectors which are used to predict the pion and positron energy deposition in the target , and the times of their signals . once the predicted waveform is subtracted the net waveform is scanned for the presence of a 4.1mev muon peak .",

    "one can strongly suppress events in which an `` old '' muon was present in the target by the time of the pion stop that triggered the readout .",
    "the `` intrinsic '' low energy tail of the pen response function below @xmath57 50mev , due to shower losses for @xmath1  decay events for pions at rest , amounts to approximately 2% of the full yield .",
    "events with @xmath90 decays in flight , with subsequent ordinary michel decay of the stopped muon in the target , add a comparable contribution to the tail .",

    "normalization , i.e. , counting the number of pions passing through the apparatus is very challenging , as the readily available processes such as the @xmath18 decay have radically different kinematics and detection systematics , and require separate detectors . finally , detection efficiency ( including detector acceptance ) , as well as trigger and event selection efficiency must be determined in absolute terms with high precision .    given all the above considerations , the temple",

    "the largest systematic uncertainty contributions arose from the number of beam pions , time in decay region , and the various efficiencies .",
    "the authors also extracted a new value of @xmath272 for the cosine of the cabibbo angle , or @xmath9 . while not as precise as the contemporary values of @xmath9 derived from superallowed fermi nuclear beta decays , it was consistent with them .",
    "the primary goal of the pibeta experiment conducted at psi and introduced in sections [ sec : pi_e2 ] and [ sec : rpd ] , was to improve by an order of magnitude the existing experimental precision of the pion beta decay branching ratio .",

    "the time range of @xmath275ns around @xmath93 , the pion stop time , was vetoed in the decay event trigger in order to suppress prompt hadronic backgrounds which had a @xmath276 times higher rate than the @xmath7  events .",
    "a prescaled sample of the prompt hadronic events was collected for systematic studies and calibrations . ]    the corresponding spectra for the normalizing @xmath1  decay , and for the @xmath3  decay which can contribute background events for the pion beta decay , are shown in sections [ sec : pen ] and [ sec : pibeta - rpd ] . since a subset of pion beta decays can also be misidentified as radiative @xmath3  decays , it was essential that all three processes be simultaneously accounted for and understood at the few parts per thousand level .",
    "in fact , ordinary ( `` michel '' ) and radiative muon decays , though not discussed here , were included as well in the comprehensive pibeta analysis , since they comprise the majority of actual events occurring in the apparatus , and dominate the accidental background to all pion decay channels .",
    "figures [ fig : pb_ang12][fig : pb_time ] demonstrate that the pion beta decay event sample was clean and well described in terms of the relevant instrumental resolutions .    during three runs in 1999 , 2000 and 2001 , the pibeta collaboration acquired over 64,000 pion beta decay events , which led to an improvement of the experimental precision of the @xmath7  branching ratio of about an order of magnitude @xcite .",

    "the combined internal systematic uncertainty was dominated by the uncertainties related to the ratio of the `` pion gate '' live fractions for the @xmath7  and @xmath1  processes , and the number of the @xmath1  events used for normalization , followed by the ratio of acceptances for the same two processes .",
    "this result represents the most stringent test of cvc and cabibbo universality in a meson , as well as of the proper treatment of the radiative corrections , which , combined , predict @xmath283 at 90% confidence limits @xcite . excluding radiative corrections gives the range @xmath284 , a @xmath285 discrepancy from the pibeta result .",
    "the pibeta collaborators also extracted @xmath286 these values are in excellent agreement with the pdg recommended value for @xmath9 , although five times less precise .",
    "following in the same vein , it is tempting to go one step further and turn the pibeta determination of the @xmath7 branching ratio around , using it instead to evaluate @xmath28 .",
    "this is accomplished by fixing @xmath9 to its extraordinarily precise pdg 2013 recommended value of @xmath287 and adjusting @xmath28 until the extracted value of @xmath288 agrees .",
    "this intriguing exercise yields @xmath289 in good agreement with direct measurements reviewed in . appropriately averaging this value of @xmath28 with those listed in , one obtains a slightly higher value than the current pdg average : @xmath290 .",
    "given the advantage in lower theoretical uncertainties compared to nuclear decays , there was every incentive to pursue a higher precision result in the pion beta decay rate or branching ratio .",
    "however , the urgency of a further improvement was considerably reduced by the brookhaven national laboratory experiment bnl e865 result@xcite and the subsequent renormalization of @xmath291 that removed a longstanding 23@xmath292 shortfall in ckm matrix unitarity . in light of the considerable experimental challenges that an improved measurement would pose ,",
    "the present full agreement of available data on @xmath9 with ckm unitarity means that a major new project on improving the precision of pion beta decay is not currently planned .",
    "we note , though , that the status of neutron beta decay is in considerable flux , with major discrepancies in the available data sets on both the beta asymmetry and the neutron lifetime @xcite . at present",
    "there are a number of projects addressing these deficiencies . while not as theoretically clean as the pion beta decay , neutron decay is free of the nuclear structure and coulomb corrections that affect nuclear beta decays , including the superallowed fermi @xmath293 transitions @xcite .",
    "a close look at the recent record of study of the decays of the charged pion reveals a great deal of activity and continued strong relevance .",
    "the extraordinary precision of the theoretical description of the @xmath294 , @xmath295 , @xmath296 and @xmath7 decays remains unmatched by the available experimental results .",
    "there have been impressive advances in the precision of the @xmath7  and @xmath3  decays in the past decade . as of this writing , we are on the verge of a significant improvement of the @xmath1  decay precision , as the pen and pienu experiments complete their analyses .",
    "even subsequent to that development , there will remain considerable room for improvement of experimental precision with high payoff in terms of limits on physics not included in the present standard model .",
