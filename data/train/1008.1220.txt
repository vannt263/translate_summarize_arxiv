    "one of the controversial problems concerned by stellar spectroscopists over several decades is the inconsistency of cno abundances between young early - type stars ( e.g. , b stars or a ",
    "f supergiants ) and the sun , where the former should reflect the composition of the current interstellar gas while the latter represents that of rather old galactic gas @xmath7  yr ago .",
    "that is , various studies have embarrassingly suggested that the former is appreciably less than the latter by @xmath0  dex ( see , e.g. , nissen 1993 ) , which is just the opposite to what we speculate , because gas metallicity should rather increase with an elapse of time as a natural consequence of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "above all , the discrepancy of oxygen is important , which is ( as one of the so - called @xmath8-elements ) considered to be synthesized and distributed essentially by massive stars via type ii supernovae . unlike c and n which are known to suffer changes due to evolution - induced dredge - up of cn - cycled processed material ( e.g. , giants or supergiants ) , the photospheric o abundance of any star is believed to generally retain the original composition of the gas from which it was formed , since the envelope mixing can not penetrate so deep in the interior as to salvage the o - burning products according to the standard theory of stellar evolution .",
    "do we have to consider the possibility of much deeper mixing ( i.e. , dredge - up of on - cycle products ) due to some unknown non - canonical process , as discussed by luck and lambert ( 1985 ) being faced with the result of significant subsolar oxygen abundance by @xmath0  dex in f supergiants and cepheids ?    meanwhile , a solution from a different viewpoint has recently been suggested , which is based on the argument that the actual solar cno abundances ( derived by considering 3d / nlte corrections along with the most up - to - date atomic data ) are by @xmath6  dex lower than those believed so far ( cf .",
    "subsection 4.2 in asplund et al .",
    "actually , przybilla , nieva , and butler s ( 2008 ) recent non - lte study of early b - type stars has demonstrated that the abundances agree well with these new solar values .",
    "though this is surely a straightforward explanation ( see also luck & lambert 1985 ) , such a `` downward revision '' has not been widely accepted yet , because it ( in turn ) causes a serious difficulty in interpreting data of solar seismological observations within the current framework of solar interior modeling ( cf .",
    "subsection 4.3 in asplund et al .",
    "2009 ) .    given this confusing situation , we feel it necessary to reinvestigate whether or not such a sun ",
    "gas abundance discrepancy really exists , based on a well - designed strategy and high - quality observational data , while paying attention to the following keypoints .",
    "first , which class of stars , being young and representing the composition of current galactic gas , are the best objects for precisely determining the oxygen abundances ?",
    "o - type stars are unsuitable for abundance studies because of their considerably unstable atmospheres with mass loss , while a - type stars tend to show abundance peculiarities ( typically o - deficiency ) in their atmospheres and are unlikely to keep their original composition .",
    "regarding high - mass supergiants ranging over wide spectral classes ( e.g. , b ",
    "f ) , sufficient accuracy in abundance determinations is hard to attain because of the difficulty in modeling their low - gravity atmospheres ( tending to be unstable ) as well as in establishing atmospheric parameters .",
    "accordingly , there is almost no better choice than to use b - type main - sequence stars for this purpose .",
    "second , which spectral lines should then be exploited in order to obtain differential oxygen abundances between the sun and b - type stars as precisely as possible ? admittedly , several elaborate oxygen abundance analyses for b - stars have been done so far ( e.g. , gies & lambert 1992 ; kilian 1992 ; cunha & lambert 1994 ; korotin et al .",
    "1999 ; hempel & holweger 2003 ; przybilla et al . 2008",
    "; niemczura et al . 2009 ) . in our opinion , however , the weakpoint of these studies is that , although the abundances were established mostly from o  ii lines ( particularly seen in the spectra of early - b stars ) , they were directly compared with the solar oxygen abundance ( based on o  i or [ o  i ] or oh lines ) simply taken from the literature of solar composition ( e.g. , anders & grevesse 1989 ; grevesse et al .",
    "2007 ; asplund et al .",
    "that is , in order to ensure an accurate abundance determination for a star relative to the sun , a `` differential analysis '' is highly desirable , which is to carry out an analysis in the same manner for the sun as well as b - stars by using the same line , by which uncertainties in @xmath9 values ( an important source of systematic errors ) can be canceled .",
    "we would here point out based on this standpoint that , among the several candidate oxygen lines observable in both b stars as well as in the sun , o  i triplet lines at the orange region of 61568  @xmath10 are most suitable for this purpose , because ( 1 ) they are neither too weak ( reliably measurable for both sun / b - stars ) nor too strong ( less affected by uncertainties in microturbulence / damping parameters ) , ( 2 ) and the non - lte effect is essentially negligible for the sun ( cf . takeda & honda 2005 ) , which means that notorious ambiguities in neutral hydrogen collisions ( serious source of uncertainties in non - lte calculations for late - type stars such as the sun ) are irrelevant here .. while these are stronger than o  i 61568 and thus more easily measurable in the spectra of both the sun and b stars , they suffer appreciably large non - lte corrections .",
    "therefore , uncertainties in h  i collision rates prevents from precisely establishing the solar oxygen abundance if these near - ir triplet lines are to be invoked ( e.g. , appendix 1 in takeda & honda 2005 ; see also fabbian et al .",
    "2009 or pereira et al . 2009a , b for the recent progress in this field ) . ]",
    "thus , the primary motivation of this study is to determine the oxygen abundances of selected b - type main - sequence stars based on the o  i 61568 lines and compare them with the solar abundance in order to see if there is any difference between these , while making use of our past experiences in o abundance determinations with these triplet lines for late - b through f supergiants or late - b / a dwarfs or fgk dwarfs including the sun ( cf . takeda & takada - hidai 1998 ; takeda et al .",
    "1999 ; takeda & honda 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , as a by - product of the analysis , we decided to study the neon abundances of b - type stars , since ne  i 6143/6163 lines suitable for abundance determinations exist in the targeted spectral region .",
    "though comparatively minor interest seems to have paid to ne and only a few abundance studies were available in the past ( e.g. , auer & mihalas 1973 ; dworetsky & budaj 2000 ; hempel & holweger 2003 ) , this @xmath8 element ( similar to oxygen ) got particular attention recently and elaborate abundance studies have been published ( cunha et al .",
    "2006 ; morel & butler 2008 ) because a possibility of considerably higher ne / o ratio ( than has ever been thought ) was proposed as a key to resolve the serious solar model problem encountered for the case of downward revision of solar cno abundances mentioned above .",
    "though recent studies tend to be against this possibility ( see also subsection 4.3 in asplund et al .",
    "2009 ) , we intend to check it independently by ourselves , which constitutes the second aim of the present investigation .",
    "the targets of this study are the selected 64 mid - though - late b - type stars mostly with spectral classes of b2b9 and luminosity classes of iii  v ( cf . table 1 ) , which are apparently bright ( @xmath11  46.5 ) as well as sharp - lined ( @xmath12  km  s@xmath13 in abt & morrell s 1995 catalogue ) . these program stars are plotted on the @xmath14 vs. @xmath15 diagram in figure 1 , where theoretical evolutionary tracks corresponding to different stellar masses are also depicted .",
    "we can see from this figure that the masses of our sample stars are in the range between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure1.eps    the observations were carried out on 2006 october 1723 by using the high - dispersion echelle spectrograph ( hides ; izumiura 1999 ) at the coud focus of the 188  cm reflector of okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) .",
    "equipped with a 4k@xmath182k ccd detector at the camera focus , the hides spectrograph enabled us to obtain an echellogram covering a wavelength range of 56006800  @xmath10 with a resolving power of @xmath19 ( case for the normal slit width of 200  @xmath20 m ) in the mode of red cross - disperser .",
    "the reduction of the spectra ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding , scattered - light subtraction , spectrum extraction , wavelength calibration , and continuum normalization ) was performed by using the `` echelle '' package of the software iraf in a standard manner . for most of the targets",
    ", we could accomplish sufficiently high s / n ratio of several hundreds .",
    "the effective temperature ( @xmath21 ) and the surface gravity ( @xmath22 ) of each program star were determined from the colors of strmgren s @xmath23 photometric system with the help of napiwotzki , scnberner , and wenske s ( 1993 ) uvbybetanew program , http://www.astro.le.ac.uk/~rn38/uvbybeta.html@xmath24 . ] which is based on moon s ( 1985 ) uvbybeta ( estimation of intrinsic colors corrected for interstellar reddening ) and tefflogg ( @xmath21/@xmath22 determination from dereddened colors ) programs .",
    "the observational data of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 were taken from hauck and mermilliod ( 1998 ) via the simbad database .",
    "the resulting @xmath21 and @xmath22 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "their typical errors may be estimated as @xmath29 in @xmath21 and @xmath6  dex in @xmath22 for the present case of mid - through - late b stars , according to napiwotzki et al .",
    "( 1993 ; cf . their section 5 ) . the model atmosphere for each star was then constructed by two - dimensionally interpolating kurucz s ( 1993 ) atlas9 model grid in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where we exclusively applied the solar - metallicity models .    regarding the microturbulence ( @xmath30 ) , which is necessary for abundance determinations",
    ", we could not establish this parameter based on our spectra because the number of strong lines was not enough . according to lyubimkov , rostopchin , and lambert ( 2004 ) ,",
    "the range of @xmath30 values is @xmath31  05  km  s@xmath13 for b - type main - sequence stars with masses of 411  @xmath32 ( cf .",
    "their figures 13 and 14 ) .",
    "therefore , we tentatively assumed @xmath30 = 3  km  s@xmath13 with possible uncertainties of @xmath33  km  s@xmath13 for all our sample stars . fortunately , as shown in subsection 4.3 ( cf . figures 3f and 4f ) , the resulting oxygen and neon abundances are not significantly affected by these ambiguities in @xmath30 , thanks to the moderate strengths of the relevant spectral lines as well as to the large thermal velocity ( which makes the role of microturbulence comparatively insignificant ) because of their being light atoms ( atomic numbers are 8 and 10 ) .",
    "the non - lte calculations for oxygen were performed in the same manner as in takeda and honda s ( 2005 ) analysis on oxygen lines of solar - type stars by using an o  i atomic model consisting of 87 terms and 277 radiative transitions .",
    "see takeda ( 2003 ) and the references therein for more computational details .    as for the statistical - equilibrium calculations for ne",
    ", we newly constructed an atomic model of ne  i comprising 94 terms ( including up to @xmath34 with @xmath35  cm@xmath13 ) and 1034 radiative transitions , based on kurucz and bell s ( 1995 ) atomic data . regarding the photoionization cross sections",
    ", we adopted the data provided by the opacity project via the topbase system ( cunto , mendoza 1992 ) for the lowest 46 terms , while the hydrogenic approximation was assumed for the remaining terms .",
    "regarding the collisional rates , we followed the recipe adopted in subsubsection 3.1.3 of takeda ( 1991 ) , which is largely based on the treatment of auer and mihalas ( 1973 ) .",
    "note that neutral - hydrogen collisions ( though included formally ) are essentially negligible compared to electron collisions in the present case of b - type stars .",
    "we carried out non - lte calculations for o as well as for ne on a grid of 36 ( = 9@xmath184 ) model atmospheres resulting from combinations of nine @xmath21 values ( 9000 , 10000 , 12000 , 14000 , 16000 , 18000 , 20000 , 22000 , 24000  k ) and four @xmath22 values ( 3.0 , 3.5 , 4.0 , 4.5 ) with anders and grevesse s ( 1989 ) solar oxygen and neon abundances of 8.93 ( o ) and 8.09 ( ne ) ( being consistent with the atlas9 model atmospheres we use in this study ) , so that we can obtain the depth - dependent non - lte departure coefficients for any star by interpolating this grid .",
    "now that the non - lte departure coefficients for o  i and ne  i lines relevant for each star are available , with which the non - lte theoretical spectrum of o  i 61568 and ne  i 6143/6163 lines can be computed , we carried out spectrum - synthesis analyses by applying takeda s ( 1995 ) automatic - fitting procedure to the 61406165  @xmath10 region while regarding @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( as well as @xmath39 and radial velocity ) as adjustable parameters to be established . ) or fe ( @xmath40 ) were also treated as variables in some cases where features of these lines were appreciable . ]",
    "the adopted atomic data of the relevant o  i and ne  i lines are presented in table 2 . how the theoretical spectrum for the converged solutions fits well with the observed spectrum",
    "is displayed in figure 2 and the resulting abundances ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) are given in table 1 .",
    "while the non - lte synthetic spectrum fitting directly yields the final abundance solution , this approach is not necessarily suitable when one wants to evaluate the extent of non - lte corrections or to study the abundance sensitivity to changing the atmospheric parameters ( i.e. , it is tedious to repeat the fitting process again and again for different assumptions or different atmospheric parameters ) .",
    "therefore , with the help of kurucz s ( 1993 ) width9 program ( which had been considerably modified in various respects ; e.g. , inclusion of non - lte effects while multiplying the line opacity as well as the line source function by appropriate factors computed from departure coefficients , treatment of total equivalent width for multi - component blended lines by integrating the synthesized spectrum ; etc . ) , we computed the equivalent widths for the o  i 61568 triplet as a whole ( @xmath41 ) , ne  i 6143 line ( @xmath42 ) , and ne  i 6163 line ( @xmath43 ) `` inversely '' from the abundance solutions ( resulting from non - lte spectrum synthesis ) along with the adopted atmospheric model / parameters , since they are much easier to handle .",
    "based on such evaluated @xmath44 values , the non - lte as well as lte abundances were freshly computed to derive the non - lte correction ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "these @xmath44 and @xmath45 values are also given in table 1 .",
    "we then estimated the uncertainties in @xmath37 and @xmath38 by repeating the analysis on the @xmath44 values while perturbing the standard atmospheric parameters interchangeably by @xmath46 in @xmath47 , @xmath48  dex in @xmath49 , and @xmath33  km  s@xmath13 in @xmath50 ( which are the typical uncertainties of the parameters we adopted ; cf .",

    "we can now compare the resulting oxygen abundances of b - type stars with the solar oxygen abundance ( @xmath51 ) derived by takeda and honda ( 2005 ) in the same manner as we did in this study ( i.e. , spectrum fitting of o  i 61568 lines ) .",
    "the histogram of star@xmath2sun differential abundances ( [ o / h ] @xmath52 ) for the 64 stars is depicted in figure 5 , where the result for late b through f supergiants derived by takeda and takada - hidai ( 1998 ) is also shown .",
    "values were computed with anders and grevesse s ( 1989 ) solar abundance of 8.93 in that paper , they have been rescaled by using the solar abundance of 8.81 adopted here . ] as manifestly seen in figure 3c , some @xmath31  510 stars at @xmath53  k exhibit appreciable discrepancies from the main trend ( i.e. , o - deficiency by several tenths dex ) , which means that chemically peculiar stars are included in late - b stars of lower @xmath21 .",
    "these outliers are recognized in figure 5 as a long tail at [ o / h ] @xmath54 .",

    "this leads to a consequence that the oxygen abundance deficit of b stars relative to the sun has been appreciably reduced down to @xmath4  dex , as compared to the previously claimed value of @xmath0  dex .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure5.eps    moreover , there is a possibility that even this small gap may almost vanish in the end .",
    "the reference solar oxygen abundance ( 8.81 ) we adopted here is the value derived by takeda and honda ( 2005 ) by a non - lte analysis of o  i 61568 lines in moon ( solar flux ) spectra using kurucz s ( 1993 ) atlas9 solar ( 1d ) model atmosphere , just similar to the present study of b stars .",
    "while the non - lte effect turned out to be negligible for these triplet lines in the solar case , no consideration was made for the 3d effect due to atmospheric inhomogeneities caused by convective granular motions .",
    "we should alert to the correction for this effect ( 3d correction ) to be applied to the solar oxygen abundance derived from classical 1d model atmospheres , though it should be irrelevant for b - type stars . as a matter of fact",
    ", an appreciable amount of this correction seems probable . according to caffau et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the 3d correction for the 1d oxygen abundance determined from the o  i 6158 line with holweger and mller s ( 1974 ) solar model is @xmath45(3d@xmath21d@xmath60 ) = @xmath61 , while that with kurucz s atlas solar model is @xmath45(3d@xmath21d@xmath62 ) = @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "their table 3 and subsubsection 5.3.3 ) .",
    "asplund et al . ( 2004 ; cf .",
    "their table 3 ) derived almost the same result ( @xmath64 ) for @xmath45(3d@xmath21d@xmath60 ) .",
    "since caffau et el.s ( 2008 ) @xmath45(3d@xmath21d@xmath62 ) correction should be relevant for takeda and honda s ( 2005 ) case , our reference solar oxygen abundance could be lowered by @xmath63  dex to be 8.69 , which is in remarkable agreement with the average ( 8.71 ) of b - stars mentioned above .",
    "consequently , we may state that `` the oxygen abundances of young mid - through - late b stars , which are considered to keep the composition of current galactic gas , are consistent with the solar photospheric oxygen abundance without any significant discrepancy . ''",
    "yet , from a quantitative point of view , some care should be made in comparing the current photospheric oxygen abundances of the sun and b stars , since the composition of the galactic gas as well as that of the solar photosphere ( both of which must have been the same at the birth of the sun ) have suffered slight changes over these @xmath65  yr due to two processes : +  first , a small enrichment in the galactic gas ( @xmath66  dex for the case of o and ne ; see , e.g. , chiappini et al .",
    "2003 ) is expected as a result of the galactic chemical evolution ( for the present case of @xmath8 elements , they are synthesized and distributed by massive stars via type ii supernovae ) .",
    "+  second , as a consequence of the diffusion process in the envelope of the sun , the current solar photospheric abundance is supposed have suffered a marginal decrease ( @xmath66  dex ; cf .",

    "2009 ) as compared to the bulk solar abundance ( i.e. , original composition ) .",
    "+ accordingly , from a purely theoretical prediction , the oxygen composition of b - type stars ( reasonably regarded as equivalent to that in the current interstellar gas ) would be somewhat higher by @xmath4  dex ( 0.04 + 0.04 ) than that in the solar photosphere .",
    "therefore , we should bear in mind that too much meaning should not be put to the apparently very good agreement ( 8.69 and 8.71 ) we obtained here , and that the presently accomplished consistency is nothing but on the order of @xmath67  dex",
    ". there may be some other factors to be considered if a much better quantitative consistency is to be pursued.(3d@xmath21d@xmath60 ) @xmath2 @xmath45(3d@xmath21d@xmath62 ) = @xmath68 , the 3d solar oxygen abundance corresponding to hm model would be 8.61 ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) .",
    "interestingly , this is by 0.1  dex smaller than the mean abundance of b - type stars , and is more consistent with the theoretical expectation . ]    finally , the overview display for the oxygen abundances of various types of stars derived from o  i 61568 lines in the same manner is presented in figure 6 , where the results of this study are combined with those of takeda and takada - hidai ( 1998 ) , takeda et al .",

    "we can see that the oxygen abundances of b - type stars ( this study ) and late b  f supergiants ( takeda & takada - hidai 1998 ) are almost within @xmath70  0.10.2  dex around the solar abundance , especially when the 3d - correction is taken into account .",

    "<S> to revisit the long - standing problem of possible inconsistency concerning the oxygen composition in the current galactic gas and in the solar atmosphere ( i.e. , the former being appreciably lower by @xmath0  dex ) apparently contradicting the galactic chemical evolution , we carried out oxygen abundance determinations for 64 mid- through late - b stars by using the o  i 61568 lines while taking into account the non - lte effect , and compared them with the solar o abundance established in the same manner . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting mean oxygen abundance was @xmath1 , which means that [ o / h ] ( star@xmath2sun differential abundance ) is @xmath3 , the difference being less significant than previously thought . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the 3d correction may further reduce the reference solar oxygen abundance ( 8.81 ) by @xmath4  dex , we conclude that the photospheric o abundances of these b stars are almost the same as that of the sun . </S>",
    "<S> we also determined the non - lte abundances of neon for the sample b stars from ne  i 6143/6163 lines to be @xmath5 , leading to the ne - to - o ratio of @xmath6 consistent with the recent studies . </S>",
    "<S> this excludes a possibility of considerably high ne / o ratio once proposed as a solution to the confronted solar model problem . </S>"
