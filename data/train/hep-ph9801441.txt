    "why should we be interested in muon colliders ?",
    "the reasons derive from the large mass of the muon compared to the electron .",
    "far less radiation from muons allows excellent energy resolution ( @xmath5few mev ) and fine energy calibration ( @xmath6  ppm ) .",
    "these features , and the enhanced coupling of the higgs boson to muons , make possible @xmath0-channel higgs resonance studies . moreover , multi - tev muon colliders with high luminosity are feasible for the study of high threshold phenomena .",
    "but muon colliders pose a challenging technology because of the short muon lifetime ( @xmath7 , @xmath8  m ) , @xmath9-decay and rescattering backgrounds in the detector , and possible radiation hazards at high energies from neutrinos emitted in muon decays . nonetheless , the physics merits of muon colliders fully warrant research and development towards their realization .",
    "the recent accelerator developments related to the design of muon colliders are summarized in the proceedings of a series of workshops@xcite .",
    "this report is devoted to a discussion of the physics that can be done at muon colliders , which has also been the subject of intense investigations@xcite .",
    "several muon collider designs are under consideration . the first muon collider ( fmc )",
    "is presently envisaged to operate at a center - of - mass energy in the range from @xmath10 to above the @xmath2 threshold with corresponding average luminosities of @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( 1 to 10  fb@xmath13/yr ) .",
    "the fmc would be a first step towards a very high energy collider , the next muon collider , with c.m .",
    "energy of 3 to 4  tev and luminosity @xmath14 ( 1000  fb@xmath13/yr ) .",
    "muon colliders would enable us to resolve the major physics issue of our time : how is the electroweak symmetry broken ?",
    "there are two scenarios for the symmetry breaking .",
    "a weakly broken scenario is based on higgs bosons , and the most popular version invokes a low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "a strongly broken electroweak scenario ( sews ) most likely would involve new resonances at the tev scale of a still unknown dynamics .",
    "muon colliders offer unique physics opportunities such as @xmath0-channel higgs production , precision threshold measurements , and high energy and luminosity for sews or susy studies of tev mass scale particles .",

    "the resolution requirements for the machine depend on the higgs width . figure  2 gives both sm and susy higgs width predictions versus the higgs mass .",

    "supersymmetry has many scalar particles ( sleptons , squarks , higgs bosons ) .",
    "some or possibly many of these scalars may have tev - scale masses@xcite . since spin-0 pair production is @xmath93-wave suppressed at lepton colliders , energies well above the thresholds are required to have sufficient production rates ; see fig .  12 .",

    "= 2.5 in      if no higgs boson exists with @xmath94  gev , then partial wave unitarity of @xmath95 scattering requires that the scattering be strong at the 12  tev energy scale .",

    "the nature of the underlying physics will be revealed by the study of all possible vector boson ",
    "vector boson scattering channels , since the sizes of the signals depend on the resonant or nonresonant interactions in the different isospin channels .",
    "several simple models for sews are :    1 .   a heavy scalar particle ( @xmath66 ) with mass @xmath100  tev and width @xmath101500  gev , 2 .   a heavy vector particle ( @xmath102 ) with @xmath103  tev and @xmath104  gev , 3 .   a nonresonant amplitude @xmath105 ( where @xmath106 is the vacuum expectation value ) which is an extrapolation of the low energy theorem ( let )",

    "for example , in the @xmath66 case , @xmath108 where @xmath109 with 1000  fb@xmath13 per year the next muon collider will allow comprehensive studies to be made of any sews signals .",
    "figure  13 illustrates the @xmath4 invariant mass distribution for the models@xcite . it would be possible to measure the width of a 350  gev scalar resonance to @xmath110  gev and thereby differentiate among scalar models , for example .",
