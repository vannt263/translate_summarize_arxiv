    "gas - rich dust disks around young stars ( hereafter , protoplanetary disks ) provide the raw material to build up planets .",
    "hence , it is critical to understand when and how they disperse .",
    "observations of protoplanetary disks suggest that they follow a two - timescale evolution . in the first few myr their dispersal",
    "is thought to be driven by viscous evolution , accretion of disk gas onto the central star .",
    "this stage is followed by a rapid ( @xmath3yr ) clearing attributed mainly to photoevaporation driven by the central star , which heats gas in the disk surface to thermal escape velocity ( e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .    while observations of blueshifted lines tracing the disk surface demonstrate that photoevaporation is occurring in some systems ( e.g. @xcite ) , its role in clearing protoplanetary material is still debated .",
    "this is mainly because photoevaporative mass loss rates are poorly constrained observationally . at the same time",
    "predicted values span two orders of magnitude for sun - like stars , from @xmath4 to @xmath5m@xmath6/yr , depending on the high - energy photons dominating the photoevaporation @xcite .",
    "the smallest mass loss rate implies that photoevaporation contributes only to the latest stages of disk clearing , while the largest is close to the median mass accretion rate of @xmath01myr - old stars ( e.g. @xcite ) suggesting that photoevaporation can drive disk dispersal early on .",
    "a critical input parameter to photoevaporative disk models is the amount of high - energy stellar radiation impinging on the disk .",
    "x - rays ( 0.1 - 10kev ) from young stars are relatively well characterized and stellar x - ray luminosities are available for hundreds of stars in nearby star - forming regions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray spectra typically peak around @xmath01kev with only a few young stars sporting a large soft excess component at 0.3 - 0.4kev @xcite .",
    "thus , the stellar chromosphere and/or corona are thought to dominate their x - ray emission ( e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "hard x - rays ( 1 - 10kev ) are also not easily absorbed by circumstellar matter ( e.g. @xcite ) , such as accretion columns or magnetically driven winds , hence measured stellar x - ray luminosities should provide a good estimate for the hard x - ray radiation reaching the disk surface . at the opposite side of the high - energy stellar spectrum , the h@xmath7-dissociating far - ultraviolet ( fuv ; 6 - 13.6ev ) luminosity of young sun - like stars",
    "has been found to be proportional to their accretion luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the fuv emission mostly traces disk gas accreting onto the star and shocked at the stellar surface .",
    "finally , extreme - uv radiation ( euv ; 13.6 - 100ev ) is poorly constrained both for young ( e.g. @xcite ) as well as for old stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is because interstellar gas easily absorbs euv photons thus hampering their direct detection .",
    "similarly , stellar euv photons may be absorbed in accretion columns or magnetically driven jets launched from the disk surface near the star ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the euv radiation reaching the disk may be substantially lower than that emitted by the star .",
    "it is also debated if most of the euv emission originates in the accretion shock or in the chromosphere ( e.g. @xcite ) . only with a rather large chromospheric component ( @xmath810@xmath9photons / s ) , which would not fade away as accretion declines , could euv radiation shut off disk accretion and clear the protoplanetary material in a timescale consistent with that observed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ground - based observations have demonstrated that the surface of protoplanetary disks can be ionized by the central star high - energy photons , e.g. via the detection and characteristic profile of the [ ne  ii ] emission line at 12.8 @xcite . in a previous contribution",
    "we showed that a fully or a partially ionized protoplanetary disk surface emits free - free cm radiation that should also be detectable with current astronomical facilities @xcite .",
    "we also derived analytic scaling relations between the ionizing radiation impinging on the disk and the free - free disk emission .",
    "recent hydrodynamical model calculations of @xcite agree with our derived relations . hence , free - free cm emission can be used to constrain the high - energy radiation actually reaching the disk and photoionizing h.    building on these findings , here we provide stringent upper limits on the euv photon luminosity reaching the disk for 14 young ( @xmath10myr ) stars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : obs ] we summarize new and nearly simultaneous cm observations of six young stars with disks obtained with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "these six targets were chosen because they are relatively nearby , far away from massive stars , and have ancillary evidence of an ionized disk surface from the detection of the [ ne  ii ] line at 12.81 ( see table  [ tab : sou ] for the main properties ) .",
    "we also preferred sources with no known jets because shocked ism gas is known to produce [ ne  ii ] and free - free cm emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in sect .  [ sect : results ] we discuss the immediate results and show that all atca sources have cm emission in excess to the dust thermal emission .",
    "we then measure the excess cm emission for the atca sources as well as for eight other disks in the literature which have a good coverage at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sect : euv_limits ] we assume that all excess cm emission is due to free - free disk emission and derive upper limits on the euv photon luminosity impinging on the disk .",
    "we discuss the main implications of our findings in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "centimeter continuum observations were carried out with the 6@xmath1122 m antennas atca interferometer between 2012 october 18 and october 21 .",
    "we used the hybrid h214 array configuration , where five antennas are arranged with baselines between 82 and 247 m , and the sixth antenna is on a 4.5 km baseline .",
    "however , the atmospheric phase stability was too poor to calibrate the longest baselines therefore we discarded all the data from the sixth antenna .",
    "our observations were conducted with the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ) , 2049 channels with a total bandwidth of 2ghz , dual sideband with frequency pairs centered at 33 + 35 ghz ( 8.8 mm ) and 17 + 19 ghz ( 17 mm ) , and simultaneous observations at 9.0 + 5.5 ghz ( 3.3 and 5.5 cm , respectively ) .",
    "in addition to our six science targets we also observed the source 1934 - 638 for flux calibration and 1921 - 293 for bandpass calibration . for each target",
    "we also identified a nearby and bright gain / phase calibrator whose exposures were interleaved with the science target exposures ( see table  [ tab : log ] ) .",
    "the data reduction followed the standard cabb procedure described in the atca user guideguide/users@xmath12guide.html ] and was carried out with the software package miriad version 1.5 @xcite . in brief , we checked individual exposures and flagged bad baselines , antennas , and/or times .",
    "for the 8.8 and 17 mm data we used the option _ opcor _ in _ atlod _ and then _",
    "tsyscal = any _ in _ atfix _ to correct the fluxes for atmospheric opacity .",
    "we then used the task _ mfcal _ on the bandpass calibrator to determine bandpass corrections taking antenna 2 as reference antenna .",
    "the bandpass solution was transferred to the flux and gain / phase calibrators using _ gpcopy_. the fluxes of the bandpass and gain / phase calibrators were then scaled to the absolute flux units using _ gpboot _ and _ mfboot_. finally , we copied the phase calibrations to the science targets with _",
    "gpcopy_. for the 17 mm data we preferred to use 1934 - 638 as bandpass calibrator because 1921 - 293 had large phase amplitudes ( between + 10@xmath13 and -10@xmath13 ) even after atmospheric opacity correction . at the end of the data reduction we measured the flux of 1921 - 293 at each frequency and could verify that it is within 10% of the values reported in the atca webpage , except for the 19ghz band for which",
    "it is within 20% .",
    "the difference at 19ghz may be due to poor weather conditions which might have also impacted the phase stability of 1921 - 293 at this frequency . because we have not used 1921 - 293 to calibrate the 17 + 19ghz data",
    ", we assume a 10% absolute flux calibration uncertainty at all frequencies investigated here . this value is also in agreement with previous analysis of atca data ( e.g. @xcite ) .    to compute continuum flux densities , rms , and identify any extension beyond the synthesized beam ,",
    "we fourier transformed the complex visibility to produce images of the sky brightness distribution ( for this task we used _",
    "invert _ , _ clean _ , and _ restore _ in miriad ) . cleaned atca maps using uniform weighting are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : first3sources ] and [ fig : next3sources ] .",
    "the resulting fits images were loaded in the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package to measure flux densities or 3@xmath14 upper limits . for this last step ,",
    "we first computed the rms in a polygonal area around the expected location of the target , which is given by the 2mass coordinates ( table  [ tab : sou ] ) .",
    "if the source is not detected we report an upper limit equal to 3 times the computed rms .",
    "if a source is detected we provide the flux density within the 3rms closed contour except in a few instances where our procedure is clearly missing some significant flux , hence we report the 2rms closed contour flux density .",
    "all flux densities and upper limits are listed in table  [ tab : fluxes ] .",
    "we detect all atca sources at 0.9 cm , all but cs  cha at 1.7 cm , all but sz  cha at 3.3 cm , and only v892  tau and cs  cha at 5.5 cm ( figs .",
    "[ fig : first3sources ] and [ fig : next3sources ] ) .",
    "several other radio sources are detected in the larger areas covered at 3.3 and 5.5 cm .",
    "the most relevant one for the interpretation of our data is hubble  4 , a young star in taurus with no circumstellar disk but strong cm emission ( see discussion in appendix  [ appendix : atcasources ] ) .    to determine if sources are extended we fit their emission with a 2d gaussian ( task _ gaussfit _ in casa ) and compare the size of the gaussian with the restored beam fwhm reported in table  [ tab : fluxes ] . with this approach",
    "we find that sz  cha and cs  cha are marginally extended at 0.9 cm ( gaussian widths of 12@xmath15 and 10@xmath15 respectively ) , in agreement with @xcite who report extended emission for these two sources at a slightly shorter ( 0.7 cm ) wavelength .",
    "sz  cha is also spatially resolved at 1.7 cm ( gaussian width of 29@xmath16 ) while cs  cha is clearly extended at 3.3 cm ( gaussian width of 35@xmath17 , position angle@xmath0162@xmath13 ) .",
    "v892  tau is only marginally resolved at 3.3 cm but its emission is clearly extended at 5.5 cm ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : first3sources ] ) .",
    "disk emission should be confined within the disk size , rarely larger than 1,000au ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the extended emission at 3.3 and 5.5 cm for v892  tau and cs  cha , which corresponds to sizes @xmath185,000au , do not have a disk origin .",
    "in addition , for cs  cha the peak emission at these long wavelengths is offset from the 2mass source coordinates ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : first3sources ] ) .",
    "high - resolution centimeter observations of young stellar objects have shown that some radio sources are elongated along a direction close to the axis of a jet / outflow detected at shorter wavelengths ( see e.g. the case of hl  tau in @xcite ) .",
    "v892  tau does not have any known jet / outflow @xcite . for cs  cha , @xcite interpreted the positional displacement in the h@xmath19 emission line as a micro - jet of @xmath010mas in size and ne - sw direction , almost perpendicular to the elongation we see at 3.3 cm .",
    "however , another possibility is that the h@xmath19 displacement indicates the direction of the recently discovered stellar companion to cs  cha ( @xcite and table  [ tab : sou ] ) .",
    "typical spectroastrometric displacement in the h@xmath19 line for known binaries have angular scales of @xmath00.2 - 0.4 times the binary separation @xcite , very close to the positional displacement measured for cs  cha .",
    "although our targets were selected to be jet - free based on well established jet diagnostics such as the optical forbidden lines from o , n@xmath20 , and s@xmath20 ( e.g. @xcite ) , jets / outflows remain the most plausible explanation for the extended cm emission seen in the atca images of these two sources . based on these images",
    "the orientation of the jet is almost n - s for v892  tau and nw - se for cs  cha .",
    "when the jet emission is not spatially resolved we report in table  [ tab : fluxes ] the flux density within the 3rms contour near the source and note that the emission is likely associated with a jet / outflow .",
    "the presence of a jet is more difficult to ascertain for sz  cha .",
    "the marginal extensions at 7 mm from @xcite and at 0.9 cm from our atca image indicate linear scales of @xmath0800 - 1,400au . at the same time",
    "the extended 1.7 cm emission is rather low s / n ( see table  [ tab : fluxes ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : first3sources ] ) and the source is not detected at longer cm wavelengths where jet emission could become dominant ( see the case of cs  cha ) .",
    "one result that may point to the presence of a jet is the detection of a strong [ ne  iii ] emission line at 15.55 resulting in an unusually high [ ne  iii]/[ne  ii ] line flux ratio of @xmath01 @xcite .",
    "this ratio suggests ionization by a rather hard euv spectrum ( l@xmath21 , @xcite ) impinging on the disk , which espaillat et al .",
    "attribute to the central star .",
    "however , shocks can locally heat the ism gas to very high temperatures ( @xmath810,000k ) depending on their velocity and in a few cases are clearly associated with millions of k plasma also producing soft x - ray emission ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "it is possible that part or most of the [ ne  iii ] emission toward sz  cha is not produced in the disk surface but in a jet ( see also the recent report of [ ne  iii ] emission from the sz  102 microjet , @xcite ) .",
    "additional observations are clearly required to establish if sz  cha is powering a jet , hence we will continue classifying this source as jet - free in our study .      in this paper",
    "we call excess centimeter emission any long wavelength emission on top of the thermal dust disk emission .",
    "the first step in identifying excess cm emission is to assemble the source spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and subtract off the thermal contribution from dust grains .    in assembling the seds of our atca sources",
    "we gather additional millimetric and centimetric fluxes from the literature . for v892",
    "tau we find millimeter fluxes in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "cs  cha and sz  cha have been observed at 870 with apex / laboca @xcite and additional millimeter / centimeter fluxes are reported in @xcite .",
    "mp  mus has a 1.2 mm detection from @xcite as well as 3 mm and centimeter data in @xcite .",
    "sr  21 has millimeter fluxes from various compilations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , v4046  sgr has been observed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite at millimeter wavelengths . a summary of literature fluxes and references is provided in table  [ tab : litval ] .",
    "in addition to our six atca targets , we include in our study other young stellar objects from the literature that have : i ) a good sed coverage at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths ; and ii ) stellar x - ray luminosities , since x - rays contribute to ionize the disk surface .",
    "these criteria result in eight additional sources : dg  tau , dk  cha , gm  aur , hl  tau , ry  tau , tcha , tw  hya , uz  taue .",
    "source properties that are relevant to our study are summarized in table  [ tab : litsou ] while literature fluxes and references to assemble their seds are provided in table  [ tab : litval ] .",
    "all sources except dk  cha have also infrared spectroscopy covering the [ ne  ii ] line at 12.81 ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : low_wind ] ) .    figs .",
    "[ fig : our ] and [ fig : lit ] show the long wavelength portion of the sed of our atca targets and literature sources .",
    "because thermal dust emission is mostly optically thin at millimeter wavelengths , the flux density can be written as @xmath22 . in fitting this relation we set a minimum uncertainty of 10% for each flux density .",
    "the fit to the millimeter fluxes , ignoring the cm excess emphasized here , results in slopes ranging from 2.4 to a maximum value of 3.5 for sr  21 , with uncertainties between @xmath00.05 and 0.1 .",
    "this range in @xmath23 is similar to that found in nearby star - forming regions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the important result is that for none of the sources studied here can thermal dust emission account for the measured centimeter fluxes .",
    "several physical mechanisms are known to produce radio emission . in sect .",
    "[ sect : results ] we discussed two atca sources with clearly extended cm emission and concluded that most of the emission is likely coming from shocked gas in jets .",
    "this gas can be ionized and produce cm free - free emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , a fully or partially ionized disk surface emits free - free cm radiation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "non - thermal ( gyrosynchrotron ) cm emission originating in magnetic fields has been also detected in late type dwarfs and several classes of active stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , a population of very large ( cm - size ) grains can produce extra cm thermal emission ( e.g. @xcite ) while very small ( nm - size ) spinning grains produce electric dipole emission in the microwave range @xcite .",
    "these different mechanisms can , and likely do , operate concurrently in young accreting stars surrounded by disks .",
    "multi - epoch and multi - wavelength radio observations can be used to assess the dominant physical mechanism ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : radioslopes ] ) but the contribution of each process can not be quantified with certainty .",
    "therefore , in sect .",
    "[ sect : euv_limits ] we will assume that all excess cm emission is due to the ionized disk surface and thus compute upper limits on the stellar euv luminosity reaching the disk .",
    "we will show that even upper limits place interesting constraints on disk dispersal theories .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung ( free - free ) radiation and non - thermal gyrosynchroton emission are characterized by power - law spectra of the form @xmath24 .",
    "cm- and nm - dust emission have a more bell - like spectral shape , which however can not be easily recognized with two - three data points typically available at cm wavelengths .",
    "therefore , we follow common practice and investigate the origin of the cm emission assuming that it has a power - law spectrum and thus compute the radio spectral index @xmath25 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a large range of spectral indices is expected both for free - free and gyrosynchroton emission . in the case of free - free emission @xmath25",
    "can be as low as -0.1 for optically thin emission ( e.g. for an ionized disk surface , @xcite ) and up to + 2 for optically thick emission .",
    "values of @xmath00.5 are predicted by @xcite for a disk surface heated and ionized by stellar x - rays .",
    "the spectral index for gyrosynchrotron emission depends on the energy distribution of the electrons and can vary between -2 and + 2 ( e.g. the review on stellar radio properties by @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite published a deep 4 and 6 cm vla survey of the ophiucus star - forming complex and detected 56 known young stellar objects : class  o / i ( protostars ) , class  ii ( accreting stars with disks ) , and class  iii objects ( non - accreting stars ) .",
    "they find a large range of @xmath25 in each sub - class but average values that decrease with evolutionary stage , from @xmath26 for the class0/i to 0 for class  ii sources to -0.4 for class  iii sources ( their fig .",
    "3 ) . at the same time ,",
    "they see that the average variability ( over a month timescale ) and flux density increase with evolutionary stage ( their figs .  4 and 5 ) .",
    "they interpret these trends as free - free emission dominating in class  0/i and class  ii sources ( and getting more optically thin in the class  ii stage ) and gyrosynchroton emission dominating in class  iii sources .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite in identifying three classes of spectral indices : positive ( @xmath27 ) , flat ( @xmath28 ) , and negative ( @xmath29 ) . however , in computing the spectral indices we subtract off the contribution from thermal dust emission because only a few of our sources have 6 cm detections , where the dust contribution is likely negligible . fig .",
    "[ fig : radioslopes ] shows the radio spectral indices for those sources that have at least two detections of excess cm emission , thus excluding sz  cha ( i d  2 ) , v4046  sgr ( i d  6 ) , and gm  aur ( i d  8) . the uncertainties in @xmath25 include the uncertainty on the slope of the dust thermal emission .",
    "seven of our sources have flat @xmath25 , consistent with free - free emission from optically thin to moderately thick plasma , thus including jet emission .",
    "tau and cs  cha ( ids 1 and 3 ) , whose atca cm emission is extended and most likely dominated by jet emission ( sect .",
    "[ sect : results ] ) , fall in this category .",
    "only three sources ( sr  21-id  5 , ry  tau - id  9 , and t  cha - id  10 ) have flat @xmath25 and no evidence of jets . of them",
    ", only sr  21 and t  cha have spectral slopes consistent with optically thin free - free disk emission while emission from ry  tau may be moderately thick as expected in the x - ray irradiated disk model of @xcite .",
    "two sources , mp  mus and dg  tau have negative spectral indices .",
    "@xcite also find class  ii sources in ophiucus with negative spectral indices , indicating that substantial contribution from gyrosynchroton emission can be present in some disk sources .",
    "multi - epoch cm observations would be helpful to further assess the non - thermal origin of the cm emission in these sources .",
    "finally , we wish to discuss the case of tw  hya , which sports one of the largest positive @xmath25 in our sample and has no evidence of a jet ( i d  7 , filled circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : radioslopes ] ) .",
    "this @xmath25 is computed from the excess emission at 3 wavelengths : 3.5 , 4.1 , and 6.3 cm .",
    "the latter two points are new vla band - integrated flux densities from @xcite .",
    "these authors note that the spectral slope in the 1-ghz - band centered at 4.1 cm is different from that at 6.3 cm , it becomes flatter at the longer wavelength .",
    "they interpret this result as an indication of dust still contributing to the 4.1 cm emission .",
    "we have thus re - computed @xmath25 neglecting the 3.5 cm flux density , where dust would contribute even more to the emission .",
    "indeed , we find that the new @xmath25 ( empty circle in fig .  [ fig : radioslopes ] ) is substantially reduced , confirming the interpretation of @xcite .",
    "thus , even this new @xmath25 should be considered an upper limit and it is likely that tw  hya has also a flat cm spectral index .",
    "sensitive observations at wavelengths longer than 6 cm are needed to test this hypothesis .",
    "although in some cases @xmath25 is not consistent with free - free disk emission , we will nevertheless assume that all the excess cm emission is from free - free so that we can derive upper limits to the euv luminosity impinging on the disk ( sect .",
    "[ sect : phieuv ] ) .",
    "a necessary condition to estimate the stellar ionizing luminosity reaching the disk atmosphere and ionizing the disk surface is that the associated free - free emission is optically thin . in @xcite",
    "we showed that even a partially ionized wind at 5,000k becomes optically thick at wavelengths longer than 20 cm for plausible wind values .",
    "we can also compute the euv photon luminosity above which the free - free emission would become optically thick using the expression for the continuum optical depth in @xcite and relating it to the emission measure as in eq .  5 from @xcite .",
    "in doing this calculation we assume a fully ionized region at 10,000k , as appropriate for the euv case , with an emitting radius equal to the gravitational radius , since most of the emission measure comes from regions close to this radius . as done in previous papers ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "we also assume that the fraction of the stellar photons intercepted by the disk is 0.7 and restrict ourselves to solar - mass stars = r where r is the midplane radial distance from the star .",
    "this is the vertical extent appropriate for euv ionization . ] . with this approach",
    "we find that the 3.3 and 5.5 cm free - free emission becomes optically thick for euv luminosities @xmath30s@xmath31 and @xmath32s@xmath31 respectively .",
    "we will see shortly that the upper limits we derive from the excess cm emission are lower than these values , meaning that free - free disk emission is optically thin at these wavelengths and we can use it to constrain the euv luminosity impinging on the disk .",
    "we also note that neglecting the absorption of euv photons by dust grains is justified .",
    "in fact , ism dust provides an optical depth to lyman continuum photons greater than one in the ionized surface zone only for @xmath33s@xmath31 ( eq .",
    "6.3 in @xcite ) , well above the luminosities that we will derive here .",
    "in addition , because of dust growth and settling in disks ( e.g. @xcite ) , the opacity of the dust at the disk surface will be reduced with respect to the ism value , further increasing the luminosity above which dust significantly absorbs euv photons .      since several physical processes can produce radio emission ( see sects .  [",
    "sect : results ] and [ sect : radioslopes ] ) , by assuming that all excess cm emission is due to free - free disk emission we will obtain upper limits to the ionizing radiation reaching the disk . both euv and x - rays can photoionize h atoms . in @xcite",
    "we used a gas temperature of 5,000k to estimate the free - free contribution from soft x - rays for the nearby disk of tw  hya , a source with an exceptionally soft x - ray spectrum ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while hard x - rays heat the gas at lower temperatures thereby producing less free - free cm emission @xcite , the relative contribution of soft- vs hard - x - rays depends on the source x - ray spectrum , which is not always well characterized .",
    "hence , we prefer to provide here conservative upper limits on the euv radiation by not subtracting off the x - ray free - free contribution .",
    "hereafter , we will use the notation @xmath34 to refer to these upper limits derived from the excess cm emission .    to estimate @xmath34 we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we fit the millimeter fluxes to calculate the contribution from dust thermal emission at cm wavelengths as discussed in sect .  [",
    "sect : results ] .",
    "next , for each cm wavelength where we detect excess emission we estimate @xmath34 using a generalization of eq .  2 in @xcite from the measured cm fluxes minus the dust thermal emission : the excess cm emission is directly proportional to the euv luminosity reaching the disk @xcite .",
    "the main assumptions here are that the characteristic temperature of the gas is 10,000k and the fraction of photons absorbed by the disk is 0.7 .",
    "this factor accounts only for the disk geometry , a further reduction in the ionizing radiation can occur because of absorption in the circumstellar matter , e.g. accretion columns and/or magnetically driven winds .",
    "the most stringent upper limits on the euv luminosity reaching the disk are summarized in table  [ tab : euv_inferred ] together with the wavelength providing such limits .",
    "the most sensitive wavelengths to place such upper limits are typically around 3 and 6 cm , see last column of table  [ tab : euv_inferred ] .",
    "note that the new 6.3 cm flux density for tw  hya reduces the upper limit on @xmath34 by a factor of @xmath03 with respect to what we obtained from the 3.5 cm datapoint @xcite and that the @xmath34 for gm  aur is consistent with that reported by @xcite .",
    "the main uncertainty in these upper limits comes from the uncertainty associated with the slope of the dust thermal emission ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "thus , we have also computed @xmath34 assuming a steeper dust sed with @xmath23 minus the 1@xmath14 uncertainty on the dust spectral slope .",
    "we find that upper limits derived at the longest wavelength ( @xmath06 cm ) typically increase from a few up to several % ( less than the absolute flux calibration uncertainty ) , because at these wavelengths dust emission contributes little . at wavelengths close to 1.5 cm changes in @xmath34",
    "can be up to a factor of 2 .",
    "thus , in discussing our results we will assume that the @xmath34 derived with our approach can be at most off by a factor of 2 .",
    "in other words , the upper limits could be at most a factor of 2 higher than those provided in table  [ tab : euv_inferred ] .",
    "we find a broad range of @xmath34 from @xmath35 to @xmath36s@xmath31 with no obvious correlation with the stellar x - ray luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : euv ] ) .",
    "sources with known jets / outflows ( red symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : euv ] ) have higher @xmath34 than those without , on average by an order of magnitude . in these sources",
    "most of the cm emission is likely arising from shocked ism material and does not trace the ionized disk surface or the ionizing luminosity from the star .",
    "this is confirmed in a few instances , such as in cs  cha , where the cm emission is found to be spatially extended and does not peak at the stellar location ( see discussion in sect .",
    "[ sect : results ] ) . if we exclude the sources with jets and average the other upper limits we find that @xmath34 is at most @xmath37s@xmath31 .",
    "how do these upper limits compare with the ionizing radiation emitted by the star ?",
    "@xcite used a small sample of solar analogs with ages between @xmath38 - 7gyr and could show that there is a tight correlation between the 1 - 1,200 stellar flux scaled at 1au and stellar age ( their fig .  6 and eq .  1 ) .",
    "using their relation for the euv 100 - 920 interval we find a luminosity of @xmath39s@xmath31 for solar analogs that are 100myr old .",
    "this luminosity is close to the upper limits we estimate for the three @xmath05 - 10myr - old sources in our sample , namely mp  mus , v4046  sgr , and tw  hya .",
    "we do not know whether the ribas et al .",
    "relation holds for sources younger than 100myr but based on x - ray and fuv studies @xcite we should expect an increase in the stellar euv luminosity at least back to 10myr .",
    "the same studies have also shown that the stellar x - ray emission remains rather constant over the 1 - 10myr age range we investigate here , while fuv radiation decreases in the same time interval and reaches the chromospheric level of @xmath40 of @xmath41 in non - accreting stars .",
    "the behavior of the euv emission in the 1 - 10myr age range will depend on whether it mostly traces accretion ( as fuv , in which case it should decrease with time ) or the chromosphere ( as x - ray , in which case it could be flat ) .    in the pre - main sequence regime , @xcite estimated order - of - magnitude euv luminosities ( between 700 - 912 ) by modeling literature emission measures from five sun - like stars that are a few myr old .",
    "they find a broad range of luminosities ( @xmath42s@xmath31 ) which we show as a dashed region in our fig .",
    "[ fig : euv ] .",
    "for the only source we have in common , ry  tau , our euv upper limit reaching the disk is only a factor of @xmath03 lower than theirs , basically consistent with their measurement given the uncertainties on these values . however , in general our @xmath34 lie on the lowest side of the stellar ionizing luminosities they infer .",
    "in addition , the @xmath34 for the @xmath05 - 10myr - old systems tw  hya , mp  mus , and v4046  sgr is several times lower than @xmath43s@xmath31 .",
    "@xcite estimated an ionizing photon luminosity of @xmath44s@xmath31 from the accretion shock on tw  hya but noted that only @xmath45phots@xmath31 could reach the disk if the emission is buried under the @xmath46@xmath47 column of neutral hydrogen gas inferred by x - ray and fuv data .",
    "our upper limit on the @xmath34 of 1.5@xmath48s@xmath31 suggests that part of the stellar euv luminosity is indeed absorbed by circumstellar matter before reaching the disk even in this relatively old system .",
    "more estimates of the ionizing radiation emitted by pre - main - sequence stars are necessary to evaluate the typical extent of circumstellar extinction .",
    "all but one ( dk  cha ) of the 14 sources studied here have fluxes or upper limits in the [ ne  ii ] line at 12.8 .",
    "this transition is relevant to our study because ionized neon is known to also probe the disk atmosphere of some young stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , this line is found to be slightly ( @xmath010km / s ) blueshifted in several disks pointing to unbound gas in a photoevaporative wind ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "ne@xmath20 could either trace the uppermost layer of the disk surface fully ionized by euv photons or rather a lower mostly neutral layer where ne is ionized by 1kev x - rays @xcite .",
    "the second configuration would imply larger mass loss rates ( @xmath49m@xmath6/yr ) than the first , e.g. the example of tw  hya in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are now in the position to answer the question : is the @xmath34 estimated in sect .",
    "[ sect : phieuv ] large enough , i.e. are there enough ionizing photons reaching the disk atmosphere , to reproduce the observed [ ne  ii ] luminosities ?",
    "we first assemble [ ne  ii ] fluxes from the literature , giving higher priority to fluxes obtained from spectrally resolved line profiles using ground - based facilities @xcite .",
    "when ground - based observations are not available we take the spitzer / irs fluxes ( @xcite , see also tables  [ tab : sou ] and [ tab : litsou ] ) .",
    "if neon atoms are ionized by euv photons , the [ ne  ii ] luminosity is directly proportional to the euv luminosity reaching the disk , hence we can convert the measured [ ne  ii ] fluxes into a @xmath50 .",
    "this quantity represents the euv luminosity necessary to reproduce the observed [ ne  ii ] luminosities and can be compared to the upper limits on the euv luminosity estimated from the excess cm emission ( @xmath34 ) . to compute @xmath50 we use eq .",
    "19 in @xcite and take the fraction of neon in the singly ionized state equal to unity .    fig .",
    "[ fig : euv_neii ] shows @xmath34 as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath50 is driven by the flux calibration uncertainty at mid - infrared wavelengths , @xmath51% for ground - based observations . for three sources ( cs  cha - id  3 , v4046  sgr - id  6 and tw  hya - id  7 ) @xmath34 is clearly not sufficient to reproduce the observed [ ne  ii ] luminosities , even when accounting for a factor of 2 uncertainty on the estimated euv upper limits .",
    "hence , at least in these sources stellar x - rays must contribute to the ionization of ne atoms .",
    "note that for these three sources there are high - resolution spectra demonstrating that the [ ne  ii ] line traces a slow ( @xmath52km / s ) photoevaporative wind @xcite .",
    "this , in combination with the low @xmath34 upper limits , implies that the [ ne  ii ] is not tracing a fully ionized disk layer but rather a lower region only partially ionized by x - ray photons .",
    "the presence of a partially ionized and unbound disk layer implies larger mass loss rates than those that can be achieved via euv - driven photoevaporation alone .",
    "@xcite recently re - analyzed the low - velocity component of the [ o  i ] optical forbidden lines from young sun - like stars .",
    "based on the line fluxes , profiles , and peak centroids they argued for the presence of a slow partially molecular photoevaporative flow ( driven by x - ray and/or fuv photons ) where oxygen is produced by fuv dissociation of oh molecules .",
    "their result also implies higher photoevaporation rates than those produced by euv - ionization only .",
    "the fact that these two independent approaches lead to the same conclusion shows that x - ray and fuv irradiation of the disk surface must be taken into account to estimate realistic photoevaporative mass loss rates .",
    "this contribution explores the use of cm data to constrain the high - energy radiation reaching the surface of protoplanetary disks and photoionizing h. because free - free emission from a partially or fully ionized disk layer is optically thin , the free - free flux density is directly proportional to the photon euv luminosity , @xmath53 . by identifying the cm emission in excess to the thermal dust emission and attributing that to free - free disk emission we obtain upper limits to the @xmath53 impinging on the disk of 14 young ( @xmath54myr ) stars .",
    "our approach results in two main findings :    1 .   the average @xmath53 upper limit reaching the disk is @xmath37s@xmath31 in sources without jets and several times lower than @xmath43s@xmath31 for the older systems tw  hya , mp  mus , and v4046  sgr .",
    "the inferred @xmath53 upper limits are not sufficient to reproduce the [ ne  ii ] luminosities from three disks , hence stellar x - rays must contribute to the ionization of ne atoms in these systems .",
    "these two results have interesting implications for our understanding of disk evolution and dispersal .",
    "the first result shows that the euv photon luminosity received by the disk is on the low side of the range of stellar euv luminosities inferred for pre - main sequence stars .",
    "such low @xmath53 luminosities do not appear to be sufficient alone to disperse protoplanetary disks in the timescale that is required by observations .",
    "we also note that accounting for gyro - synchrotron and other sources of cm emission would further reduce our estimates ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : excess ] and appendix  [ appendix : hubble4 ] ) , making it more difficult for euv photoevaporation alone to clear out protoplanetary material .",
    "the second result demonstrates that , at least in three systems , the [ ne  ii ] emission at 12.81 primarily traces a mostly neutral disk region where ne atoms are ionized by 1kev x - ray photons .",
    "this , in combination with blueshifts in the peak emission pointing to a wind , indicates that disk gas is photoevaporated deeper in the disk at rates larger than those predicted by euv irradiation alone .",
    "how much higher depends on the relative contribution and evolution of stellar fuv and x - rays in driving and maintaining photoevaporative winds @xcite . in line with the [ o  i ] 6300 observations @xcite ,",
    "our findings demonstrate that star - driven photoevaporation contributes to disk dispersal at higher disk masses than previously thought .    in the next years",
    "the synergy between alma and sensitive cm interferometers such as the evla will enable extending these studies to larger samples of disks in nearby star - forming regions .",
    "these data will show which are the typical upper limits on the euv luminosity reaching the disk .",
    "such values , in combination with measurements of the mass accretion rate ( as suggested in @xcite ) or direct tracers of the disk ionized surface ( as the [ ne  ii ] line discussed here ) will enable to firmly establish if euv photons play a minor role in the dispersal of protoplanetary material .",

    "<S> the amount of high - energy stellar radiation reaching the surface of protoplanetary disks is essential to determine their chemistry and physical evolution . here , we use millimetric and centimetric radio data to constrain the euv luminosity impinging on 14 disks around young ( @xmath02 - 10myr ) sun - like stars . for each object </S>",
    "<S> we identify the long - wavelength emission in excess to the dust thermal emission , attribute that to free - free disk emission , and thereby compute an upper limit to the euv reaching the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we find upper limits lower than 10@xmath1photons / s for all sources without jets and lower than @xmath2photons / s for the three older sources in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> these latter values are low for euv - driven photoevaporation alone to clear out protoplanetary material in the timescale inferred by observations . in addition , our euv upper limits are too low to reproduce the [ ne  ii ] 12.81 luminosities from three disks with slow [ ne  ii]-detected winds . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the [ ne  ii ] line in these sources primarily traces a mostly neutral wind where ne is ionized by 1kev x - ray photons , implying higher photoevaporative mass loss rates than those predicted by euv - driven models alone . in summary </S>",
    "<S> , our results suggest that high - energy stellar photons other than euv may dominate the dispersal of protoplanetary disks around sun - like stars . </S>"
