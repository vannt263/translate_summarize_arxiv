    "the rotor - router model gives a deterministic analogue to random walks on directed graphs ( digraphs ) .",
    "it is an offshoot of the abelian sandpile , or chip - firing , model introduced by bak , tang , and wiesenfield @xcite to study physical phenomena collectively known as  self - organized criticality . \"",
    "work by dhar @xcite and others on chip - firing gave new insights into phenomena such as the spreading of forest fires , the formation of fractal - like river networks , and other problems in statistical mechanics .",
    "their work , notably the discovery of the sandpile group , laid the groundwork for further progress in chip - firing and rotor - routing .",
    "more recent combinatorial work on chip - firing can be found in the work of diaconis and fulton @xcite , and that of levine @xcite .",
    "rotor - routers , first introduced by priezzhev et al .",
    "@xcite to study self - organized criticality , were then independently rediscovered several times in various connections .",
    "these include load - balancing , as in rabani , sinclair and wanka @xcite , and the internal diffusion limited aggregation ( idla ) model , as in diaconis and fulton @xcite .",
    "rotor - routers have been studied extensively as a quasirandom analogue of random walks and markov chains @xcite , in particular for understanding idla .",
    "recent progress shows that rotor - router aggregation satisfies similar , though much stronger , spherical asymptotics as random idla @xcite .",
    "holroyd et al .",
    "@xcite outlined a more general theory of rotor - routers on arbitrary digraphs , followed by the 2011 article @xcite by giacaglia et al .",
    "that proved the periodicity of rotor - router hitting sequences and the conservation of palindromicity .",
    "the universality problem , proposed by propp , has been of interest since a solution can be viewed as a significant generalization of the aforementioned results by giacaglia et al .",
    "propp asks for the classification of rotor types , the fundamental units of rotor - router networks , that can model all others .",
    "these are called _ universal_. any complete theory of rotor - routers requires an understanding of rotor universality , just as number theory requires an understanding of primes and ring theory an understanding of units .",
    "our main results towards this end are the reduction theorem of section [ reductsect ] , reducing the problem to the fairly manageable space of two - state rotors , and the introduction of the compressor algorithm in section [ compressor ] , which proves universality for a large number of rotors and significantly simplifies the problem for the rest .    the relevant results from @xcite are presented in section [ backmot ] along with a rigorous description of the rotor - router model and the concept of universality . in section",

    ". sections [ morebal ] and [ abba ] focus on the action of the compressor on specific classes of balanced rotors .",
    "finally , section [ future ] makes explicit the many possible directions of future work hinted at in the rest of the report , and in section [ acknowledgements ] the people who made this work possible are acknowledged .",
    "on a finite directed graph @xmath3 , allowing self - loops and multiple edges , a rotor - router network is imposed as follows .",
    "we choose a _ source _ vertex as well as a set of _ target _ vertices with outdegree @xmath4 .",
    "every non - target vertex must be able to reach at least one target . at each non - target",
    "vertex , we choose a _ rotor pattern _ denoted @xmath5 comprising an infinite periodic sequence of the directed edges emanating from @xmath6 .",
    "a particle travels through the network , beginning at the source and traveling until it reaches a target , whereupon it is returned to the source and commences a new walk .",
    "after its @xmath7-th visit to non - target vertex @xmath6 , the particle leaves @xmath6 along edge @xmath8 . at this moment",
    ", we say that the first @xmath7 terms of the rotor pattern at @xmath6 have been _ used up _ , or _",
    "it is important to note that this scheduling policy is purely local and deterministic , and does not depend on the in - edge by which the particle enters @xmath6 .",
    "the _ hitting sequence _ of the network is defined as the infinite sequence of targets successively visited by this particle .",
    "hitting sequences are eventually periodic ; in @xcite , it is shown that they are also periodic from the start .",
    "each rotor pattern can be described by a partition @xmath9 of @xmath10 ( this set is denoted @xmath11 $ ] ) where @xmath7 is its period , and @xmath12 $ ] are partitioned into the same block of @xmath9 iff @xmath13 .",
    "each block of @xmath9 is associated with a distinct natural number , which gives a representation of the rotor that we call its _ rotor type_. there are an infinite number of such representations for every rotor pattern .",
    "for instance , if the pattern at a vertex @xmath6 with two out - edges @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the sequence @xmath16 with period 3 , we can write its type as 1 , 2 , 2 , or as 4 , 7 , 7 .",
    "typically if all the numbers are single digits , commas are omitted and we write 122 or 477 instead .    often , we abuse these definitions and use the terms  rotor pattern , \"  rotor type , \" and  rotor \" interchangeably to avoid cumbersome language .",
    "a rotor is said to have @xmath17 states if exactly @xmath17 distinct natural numbers appear in its type .",
    "two rotor types @xmath1 , @xmath18 are said to be _ equivalent _ if they can represent the same rotor pattern .",
    "this is denoted @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath20 .    given a rotor type @xmath1",
    ", the notation @xmath21 denotes its period length , and @xmath22 represents its @xmath23-th term , where @xmath23 is taken modulo @xmath21 .",
    "propp introduced the idea that an entire rotor - router network can be thought of as a single meta - rotor with rotor pattern equivalent to its hitting sequence , since hitting sequences are always periodic .    to formalize this concept",
    ", we say that a rotor type @xmath1 can _ model _ a rotor type @xmath18 if there exists a _ homogeneous",
    "_ rotor - router network , one containing only rotors of type @xmath1 , with a hitting sequence equivalent to @xmath18 . working off this idea",
    ", propp defined a _",
    "universal _ rotor as a rotor that can model any other .",
    "propp then raised the natural question : which rotor types @xmath1 are universal ?    a rotor type is called _ palindromic _ if it reads the same forwards and backwards ( e.g. @xmath24 ) , and _ block - repetitive _ if it is the concatenation of uniform sequences of the same length @xmath17 ( e.g. @xmath25 ) .",
    "the length @xmath17 is known as the _ block length _ of such a rotor .",
    "we define :    by a _ block of length @xmath17 _ of a rotor type @xmath1 , where @xmath17 divides @xmath21 , we mean a subsequence of @xmath1 of the form @xmath26 , @xmath27 , ... ,",
    "@xmath28 , where @xmath29",
    ". we call this specific block the @xmath30-th block of length @xmath17 of @xmath1 , denoted @xmath31",
    ".    a block - repetitive rotor of block length @xmath17 is one such that every block of length @xmath17 is uniform .",
    "it is important to distinguish blocks from _ runs _ , where the two are distinct in that @xmath32 is always a run of @xmath1 but only a block if @xmath33 divides @xmath34 .",
    "uniform runs are important in section [ morebal ] .",
    "it was proven by giacaglia et al .",
    "@xcite that a network composed entirely of palindromic rotors has a palindromic hitting sequence , and similarly that a network composed entirely of block - repetitive rotors of block length @xmath35 has a block - repetitive hitting sequence with the same block length @xmath17 . from these results",
    "it follows that neither palindromic nor block - repetitive rotor types can be universal .",
    "we believe these two classes encompass all nonuniversal rotors , so the following definition is natural :    a rotor type is _ boppy _ if it is palindromic or block - repetitive . otherwise , it is _",
    "unboppy_.    henceforth , all bold uppercase letters or words will stand for classes of rotors .",
    "we let @xmath36 denote the class of all rotor types , @xmath37 the class of all palindromic rotors , @xmath38 the class of all block - repetitive rotors , @xmath39 the class of all universal rotors , and @xmath40 the class of all boppy rotors .",
    "also , @xmath41 denotes the complement of a set @xmath42 of rotors ( with respect to @xmath36 ) . in this notation ,",
    "giacaglia et al .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath43 .",
    "we conjecture that more is true :    [ cnjuniv ] as classes of rotor types @xmath44 .",
    "let the notation @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 , define the class of rotor types that are palindromic iff @xmath48 and block - repetitive with block length @xmath33 ( but no larger block length ) . the conjecture above",
    "can then be strengthened to :    [ cnjstrong ] every rotor type @xmath49 is universal in @xmath45 .",
    "conjecture [ cnjstrong ] is only slightly stronger than conjecture [ cnjuniv ] , since conjecture [ cnjuniv ] implies that any rotor of class @xmath50 is universal in that class .",
    "it would only remain to show the same for the palindromic classes @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we also present a weakening that is more directly amenable to our methods :    [ central ] every rotor is universal in @xmath45 for some choice of @xmath52 and @xmath33 .    in this paper , conjectures [ cnjuniv ] through [ central ] will be our guiding focus ,",
    "although we will make many related inquiries of independent interest .",
    "the second half of this report focuses on the compressor configuration in figure [ compfig ] , so named because it tends to shorten the lengths of the rotors upon which it is applied .",
    "the compressor can be viewed alternatively as a rotor - router network , as a mapping from rotor types to rotor types , or simply as a mapping from binary strings to binary strings .",
    "this last viewpoint is discussed extensively in sections [ morebal ] and [ abba ] .",
    "a related issue put into focus by the action of the compressor is the definition of a complexity measure for periodic binary strings . with the similar process known as the differential operator , or ducci map , the complexity of such strings can be defined in terms of the length of the end cycle when the map is applied repeatedly @xcite , or alternatively as the number of applications of the map before a term repeats . since the compressor acts in an analogous way on balanced binary strings",
    ", we can also define a complexity measure of binary strings based on the compressor algorithm .",
    "this motivates our discussion of burd and ab - ba rotors as the elements of fixed cycles of the compressor  map \" on binary strings .",
    "as a simple example of the rotor - router network , consider the directed graph in figure [ ex1 ] .",
    "the underlying digraph , shown in figure [ ex1](a ) , consists of @xmath53 non - target vertices labeled @xmath54 , of which vertex @xmath55 is the source , as well as three targets @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the thin dark arrows denote the current state of the rotor at that vertex , or the direction by which the last particle left . in the other two diagrams ,",
    "two walks of the particle to a target are traced by thicker dark arrows . upon entering a new vertex , the particle shifts the rotor to the next possible exit direction ( counterclockwise ) and leaves along this new rotor setting .",
    "the rotor types are rather simple in this case , since the rotor patterns proceed counterclockwise ; they are @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , at vertices @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the hitting sequence begins @xmath58 , @xmath56 , as shown .",
    "from this example we already see some applications of rotor - routers .",
    "first , a rotor walk is the _",
    "deterministic analogue of a random walk _ , since rotor walks hit targets with the same frequencies as their associated random walks do in expectation @xcite . to be precise , rotor - routers are quasirandom in the sense that they are clearly nonrandom ( unlike pseudorandom processes ) and yet model random processes in some ways . perhaps , if a randomized algorithm can be replaced with one involving rotor - routers , deterministic worst - case bounds may be given in place of probabilistic time bounds .",
    "it is not difficult to imagine how rotor - routers could be useful in load - balancing for parallel processing @xcite .",
    "this  derandomization \" has also been used successfully to study the idla problem about random walks on the plane lattice @xcite .",
    "rotor walks share another property with random walks : the particle is _ not responsible for knowing its destination _ ( thanks to yan zhang of mit for pointing this out ) . in conventional networking ,",
    "each of the innumerable packets of information traveling through a network has some responsibility for finding its way to its destination . in a rotor - router network , however , particles are blindly shoved around but end up reaching targets in a predictable fashion .",
    "thus rotor - routers could provide a robust mechanism for the distribution of information through large networks , especially if some regular pattern of delivery is required and the processing power at individual nodes is limited .",
    "we proceed to our second example , which is of direct interest to the problem at hand .",
    "we show that @xmath61 .",
    "consider the hitting sequence of a rotor network in the form of a complete binary tree of depth @xmath7 with @xmath62 non - target nodes and @xmath63 targets , such that each rotor in the network is of type @xmath2 .",
    "this means that particles leave each node in an alternating fashion .",
    "the source lies at the root of the tree .",
    "figure [ ex2 ] shows such a tree of depth @xmath64 .",
    "now , we ask , what is the sequence of targets hit ?",
    "let us show by induction that the hitting sequence is some permutation of the @xmath63 targets .",
    "in the case @xmath65 , we have a single non - target node , the source , so the two targets are hit in an alternating fashion . now , suppose the statement is true for some @xmath66 .",
    "consider the binary tree of depth @xmath67 .",
    "it can be split into two parts : its first @xmath7 layers , forming a smaller binary tree , and its deepest layer , consisting of the @xmath63 non - target nodes directly preceding the targets . using the inductive hypothesis ,",
    "the first set can be replaced by a single source meta - rotor of type @xmath68 , emitting particles to a permutation of the last layer of rotors .",
    "now the result follows immediately by induction ; this meta - rotor must emit two entire periods worth of particles to the last layer before any target is hit twice , since the rotors are of type @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that all @xmath69 targets are hit once before any one is hit twice .    from the argument above",
    ", it follows that @xmath2 can make any rotor type of the form @xmath68 for @xmath66 . in the spirit of cauchy s",
    "proof of the am - gm inequality , we modify the tree slightly to show that @xmath2 can make any rotor type of the form @xmath70 , for any @xmath71 . for each @xmath72 , choose @xmath7 such that @xmath73 .",
    "consider the binary tree network of depth @xmath7 , with @xmath63 targets , as before .",
    "now , remove @xmath74 targets , routing their predecessors directly back to the root .",
    "this modification essentially  hides \" the extra targets the operation of the rest of the network is not affected ( in the next section such a modification is called a _ destructive reduction _ ) .",
    "the remainder of the hitting sequence has type @xmath70 , as desired .",
    ".,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    finally , to form an arbitrary rotor type @xmath75 of period @xmath17 from @xmath2 , first construct the modified binary tree hitting @xmath17 targets , as above .",
    "then , merge together the targets such that two targets @xmath76 $ ] are combined iff @xmath77 ( in the next section such an operation is called a _ merging reduction _ ) .",
    "the hitting sequence is now the rotor type we want , so @xmath61 .",
    "henceforth , all of our attacks on the universality problem will be based on the fact that @xmath2 is universal , since any rotor @xmath1 that can model @xmath2 is also universal .",
    "the flexibility of the rotor - router model allows room for the generalization of results about two - state rotors to any number of states . in this section ,",
    "we propose and prove a theorem regarding the reductions of multi - state rotors to two - state rotors .",
    "a rotor type can often be thought of as a special case of another type with more states .",
    "the rotor type @xmath78 , for instance , is a special case , or _ reduction _ , of the type @xmath79 , since we may direct each edge in a @xmath79-type rotor numbered @xmath80 in the same direction as the one numbered @xmath81 .",
    "this reduction is described informally as @xmath82 , and called a _ merging reduction_. along the same lines , @xmath60 is also a special case of the type @xmath79 , as each edge in a @xmath79 rotor numbered @xmath80 can be turned into a self - loop , eliminating all the @xmath80 s .",
    "this reduction is denoted @xmath83 informally , and called a _ destructive reduction_. in general we can always reduce a rotor by merging two of its states or deleting one altogether .",
    "the following lemma about reductions gets us close to our goal , theorem [ reduction ] .",
    "[ reductlem ] if @xmath84 has more than two states , and all of its merging reductions are boppy , then there exist three states of @xmath1 , which we assume to be @xmath85 , such that the reductions @xmath86 and @xmath87 of @xmath1 are block - repetitive with coprime block lengths and @xmath88 is palindromic .    because @xmath89 , there exists some integer @xmath23 such that @xmath22 and @xmath90 differ . without loss of generality ,",
    "call these two states @xmath55 and @xmath81 , respectively . consider another state , which we call @xmath64 , without loss of generality . by our assumptions , if we apply @xmath86 , the rotor becomes boppy .",
    "it can not become palindromic , since @xmath22 and @xmath90 still differ , so it must become block - repetitive .",
    "let its block size be @xmath34 .",
    "every block of @xmath81 s in @xmath1 must then have length divisible by @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , if we reduce @xmath91 , the rotor becomes block - repetitive with some block size @xmath33 , so the @xmath55 s must occur in blocks of length @xmath33 .",
    "now if @xmath34 and @xmath33 share any common factors @xmath92 , both reductions are block - repetitive with block length @xmath92 .",
    "also , each block of @xmath81 s has length divisible by @xmath92 , as does each block of @xmath55 s .",
    "therefore , the remaining @xmath64 s must also be in blocks of length @xmath92 , so that @xmath1 is itself block - repetitive with block length @xmath92 .",
    "a contradiction has been reached so @xmath34 and @xmath33 must be coprime .",
    "suppose these two merging reductions , @xmath91 and @xmath93 are both block - repetitive , and consider the reduction @xmath88 .",
    "first , suppose it too is block - repetitive , with block length @xmath94 .",
    "it follows that the @xmath64 s occur in blocks of length @xmath94 .",
    "also , if @xmath34 or @xmath33 shares factors with @xmath94 , then we have the same contradiction as before , that @xmath1 itself is block - repetitive .",
    "we have proven that @xmath34 , @xmath33 , and @xmath94 are pairwise coprime .",
    "choose any @xmath23 not a multiple of @xmath95 .",
    "then , @xmath22 and @xmath96 lie in the same uniform block for at least two of the three numbers @xmath34 , @xmath33 , @xmath94 .",
    "it follows that @xmath97 .",
    "we have immediately that @xmath1 is block - repetitive with block length @xmath95 .",
    "thus we have reached a contradiction and @xmath88 must give a palindromic reduction instead , as desired .    for the rotor type @xmath98 , five of its six possible reductions",
    "are boppy ; two are block - repetitive and three are palindromic .",
    "therefore , the following theorem may come as a surprise .",
    "[ reduction ] every @xmath89 with more than two states has an unboppy reduction .",
    "suppose there exists @xmath89 such that all reductions of @xmath1 lie in @xmath99 .",

    "@xmath81 , or @xmath64 occurs in blocks of length @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we can discount them entirely ; if we can show that the subsequence of @xmath1 containing only @xmath55 , @xmath81 , or @xmath64 has an unboppy reduction , then it is automatic that @xmath1 itself has an unboppy reduction by the same merging or destructive reduction rule . indeed ,",
    "if the reduction of this subsequence is not palindromic the corresponding reduction of @xmath1 can not be palindromic . similarly , if the reduction of this subsequence is not block - repetitive , then the corresponding reduction of @xmath1 just has some blocks of length @xmath101 inserted , and is still not block - repetitive .",

    "let us prove that , in this case , the destructive reduction @xmath102 is unboppy .",
    "the resulting type is not palindromic ; otherwise , @xmath1 must have been palindromic , since @xmath88 is also palindromic .",
    "it remains to show that this rotor is not block - repetitive .",
    "if it is , the block length must be a multiple of @xmath33 , since all @xmath55 s occur in such blocks , and a multiple of @xmath34 , since all @xmath81 s occur in such blocks .",
    "hence , the resulting type must have block length @xmath101 .",
    "but then , the @xmath64 s removed must also have been in blocks of @xmath101 in order for the reductions @xmath91 and @xmath86 to have been block - repetitive .",

    "we only need the number of @xmath287 s in the first @xmath21 terms of @xmath112 and the number of @xmath287 s in the first @xmath21 terms of @xmath115 to sum to the number of @xmath287 s in the first @xmath290 terms of @xmath1 .",
    "each @xmath287 in the first two periods of @xmath1 corresponds to one @xmath287 in the first @xmath21 terms of either @xmath112 or @xmath115 .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath291 , @xmath292 , and @xmath293 .",
    "then , in configuration @xmath107 , @xmath294rotor @xmath295 and @xmath294rotor @xmath296 both go back to the source , while in @xmath115 , they route to targets @xmath80 and @xmath53 . in @xmath112",
    "this block @xmath287 will not appear in the hitting sequence , while in @xmath115 it contributes a @xmath287 .",
    "each block @xmath287 in the @xmath290 terms of @xmath1 contributes a @xmath287 to exactly one of @xmath112 and @xmath115 .",
    "in particular , this shows that there is some sequence of @xmath107 s and @xmath110 s that never increase @xmath297 .",
    "further , the theorem shows that if @xmath297 is changed at all by one of @xmath107 and @xmath110 , then it must be strictly decreased by one of them .",
    "we end with two specific results based on this idea .",
    "[ one21 ] every @xmath228 consisting of more than one block of @xmath2 and exactly one block of @xmath287 is universal .",
    "let @xmath298 denote the position of the @xmath287 block in such an @xmath299 .",
    "if either of @xmath300 , @xmath301 is not equal to @xmath297 , then one of them must be strictly less than @xmath297 and be zero , by theorem [ bafreq ] .",
    "otherwise , both @xmath112 and @xmath115 also have exactly one @xmath287 block .    if @xmath302 , then one of @xmath112 and @xmath115 is @xmath2 unless @xmath303 or @xmath304 .",
    "if @xmath303 , then one of @xmath305 , @xmath306 is @xmath307 , and another application of @xmath107 or @xmath110 suffices . if @xmath304 , then one of @xmath305 , @xmath306 is @xmath308 , and again @xmath1 is universal after another application of @xmath107 or @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath309 , then one of @xmath112 and @xmath115 is @xmath2 if @xmath303 or @xmath304 . otherwise , it is easy to prove that one of @xmath305 , @xmath306 is @xmath310 , so some combination of @xmath112 , @xmath115 must move the @xmath287 block to position @xmath55 .",
    "the proof above shows that the ab - ba problem can be reinterpreted as follows :    given a periodic sequence @xmath311 of @xmath4 s and @xmath55 s , where @xmath4 represents @xmath2 and @xmath55 represents @xmath287 , we are allowed to perform the following two transforms on the sequence .",
    "the first takes @xmath312 to @xmath313 , and the second to @xmath314 , where @xmath315 and @xmath316 .",
    "the problem is to determine when these two transforms , applied repeatedly , can take a sequence to a constant one . in this spirit ,",
    "the next theorem is immediate .    if @xmath228 satisfies the following conditions :    a.   @xmath302 .",
    "b.   for any two @xmath287 blocks of @xmath1 that are the @xmath34-th and @xmath33-th blocks of @xmath1 , @xmath34 and @xmath33 do not satisfy @xmath317 . c.   for every pair of @xmath287 blocks of @xmath1 , their positions as blocks have the same parity .    then @xmath318 .",
    "it is clear from the proof of theorem [ one21 ] that one of @xmath319 is @xmath2 , since each @xmath287 block acts independently of the others .",
    "if we are patient we can extend these two results somewhat , but it does not seem fruitful in general to do so .",
    "here we collect together some possible directions of future work on the universality problem and the related string manipulations .",
    "the algebraic perspective in section [ compressor ] may have further implications for the compressor algorithm . in section [ empiricalresults ] we mentioned several conjectures inspired by empirical data .",
    "it was conjectured that the compressor directly proves the universality of all non - palindromic rotors of prime length and all ab - ba rotors of length @xmath285 ; these are the focus of our current work .",
    "another direction to take is the investigation of the universality of burd rotors , which are central to the compressor algorithm .",
    "the classification of burd strings is interesting in its own right , especially given that nontrivial examples like 1122222111 exist . also , the fascinating self - reference of the burd condition merits more attention .",
    "another problem proposed by propp asks for the universality of rotors when _ cyclic shifts of the same rotor are considered equivalent_. our results point to the conjecture that all rotors are universal under this alternative definition .",
    "the universality question can also be generalized in another direction , that of determining which finite sets of rotors are universal when taken together .",
    "resolution of the universality problem would almost completely solve this as well .",
    "we may try to quantify our results on universality ; instead of asking whether or not rotor @xmath1 makes rotor @xmath18 , we can ask _ how efficiently _ @xmath1 can make @xmath18 .",
    "such a question provides another notion of the  complexity \" or  information value \" of binary strings .",
