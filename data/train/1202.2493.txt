    "intermediate polars ( ips ) form a sub - class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , in which a magnetic white dwarf accretes material from a late type companion filling its roche lobe .",
    "the rotation of the white dwarf is not phase - locked to the binary period of the system . because the magnetic axis is offset from the spin axis of the white dwarf , this causes oscillations in the x - ray and optical wavelength bands .",
    "the x - ray oscillation period is usually identified as the spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "in addition to the spin and orbital periods , the reprocessing of x - rays at some part of the system that rotates with the orbital period gives rise to emission that varies with the beat period , where @xmath3 .",
    "this synodic counterpart is often called the orbital sideband of the spin frequency .",
    "a comprehensive review of ips is given in @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that ips possess hard x - ray spectra with high and complex absorption , and this might be sufficient to recognize a cv as an ip @xcite .",
    "it was also suggested to call some ips as `` hidden ips '' in the cases when the spin period of the white dwarf is undetectable due to unfavourable alignment of the magnetic dipole axis of the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "in fact , many x - ray sources detected by _",
    "chandra _ and _ integral _ were classified as ips on the basis of their hard x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is considered that these ip classifications are suggested on the basis of data that can not cleanly distinguish ips from other types of cvs and follow - up observations in the optical or softer x - ray bands are needed @xcite . because the spin period modulation is the defining characteristic of an ip , measurements of the spin period remain the necessary condition for accepting a cv as an ip ( mukai k. , http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/koji.mukai/iphome ) .",
    "long - term tracking of the spin period is equally important because allows an observational test of spin equilibrium @xcite .",
    "moreover , the white dwarf spin rates give insight into the angular momentum flows within the binary @xcite .    the source xss  j00564 + 4548 was found in the _ rxte _ all sky survey and identified with the x - ray _ rosat _ source 1rxs j005528.0 + 461143 .",
    "lately it was renamed as v515  and .",
    "@xcite discovered its ip nature .",
    "they detected an optical oscillation with a period of about 480  s. @xcite detected an x - ray period of @xmath4  s and by that confirmed this discovery . within the measurement errors , this period coincided with the period found by @xcite and was attributed to the spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "in addition , @xcite found an x - ray oscillation with a period of @xmath5  s , which was interpreted as the orbital sideband .",
    "this implies the orbital period must be 2.7  h and places v515  and in the 23  h cv period gap .",
    "@xcite found the orbital variability of v515  and both in x - rays and from optical spectra and confirmed this cv in the period gap .",
    "they found a more precise @xmath6 of @xmath7  h with possible aliases .",
    "however , the oscillation period found in x - rays by @xcite turned out different , namely @xmath8  s. this period is incompatible with @xmath9 found by @xcite because the difference of the oscillation periods in fifteen times exceeds the measurement error .",
    "although the ip nature of v515  and raises no doubts , obviously @xmath9 can not reveal such a large instability . to eliminate this uncertainty , in 2008 we performed photometric observations of v515  and .",
    "the analysis of these data showed that due to a large oscillation amplitude and a relatively short oscillation period v515  and is a good candidate to search for spin - up or spin - down . to obtain an oscillation ephemeris with a long shelf life necessary for this task , in 2009 we performed additional photometric observations . in this paper we present results of all our observations , spanning a total duration of 233  h within 33 nights .",
    "in observations of cvs we use a multi - channel photometer with photomultiplier tubes that allows us to make continuous brightness measurements of two stars and the sky background .",
    "such observations make it possible to obtain evenly spaced data .",
    "then , in cases of smooth signals , classical methods of analysis such as the fourier transform turn out optimal in comparison with numerous methods appropriated to unevenly spaced data ( e.g. lomb - scargle periodogram ) @xcite .",

    "a journal of the observations is given in table  [ journal ] .",
    "the programme and comparison stars were observed through 16-arcsec diaphragms , and the sky background was observed through a 30-arcsec diaphragm .",
    "the comparison star is usno - a2.0 1350 - 00933560 .",
    "it has @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12  mag .",
    "data were collected at 8-s sampling times in white light ( approximately 300800  nm ) , employing a pc - based data - acquisition system .",
    "we used the ccd guiding system , which enables precise centring of the two stars in the diaphragms to be maintained automatically .",
    "this improves the accuracy of brightness measurements and facilitates the acquisition of long continuous light - curves .",
    "the design of the photometer is described in @xcite .",
    ".journal of the observations . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     two observed oscillations are most probably the white dwarf spin period and orbital sideband .",
    "this implies @xmath6 is equal to @xmath13  h. in many cases it may be difficult to find the orbital variability of a cv due to rising of the noise level at low frequencies due to flickering . but",
    "here this task is somewhat facilitated because we know the precise value of a possible orbital period .",
    "[ figure6 ] presents the low - frequency part of the power spectrum of the v515  and dada incorporated into the common time series , in which the peak coinciding with the calculated period can be revealed although this peak is not prominent among noise peaks .",
    "it corresponds to a period of @xmath14  h. the precision of the coincidence of the calculated and detected periods is high , where the difference between them is less than @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the coincidence of the calculated and detected periods , we found several signs that the variability with @xmath6 is real . in the power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] ) we revealed the one - day alias , which strictly corresponds to the due frequency .",
    "[ figure7 ] shows the vicinity of the peak with @xmath6 on expanded scale . here",
    "two one - month aliases are easily detectable .",
    "the presence of the one - day and one - month aliases is the sign that the oscillation with @xmath6 is coherent and hence real .",
    "[ figure8 ] presents two light - curves folded with the detected @xmath6 by using the data of 2008 and 2009 separately .",
    "these two folded light - curves show similar shapes and coincide in phase .",
    "this again confirms the reality of the orbital variability because not only shows the phase coherence but also reveals the orbital variability within two independent data sets .",
    "we performed extensive photometric observations of v515  and and clearly found two highly coherent oscillations with the periods @xmath15  s and @xmath16  s. we detected these two optical oscillations for the first time . although the optical oscillation that certifies v515  and as an ip was found earlier by @xcite , the quality of their observations was such that they did not be able to detect two separate oscillations due to a low frequency resolution .",
    "the fwhm of the peak in their lomb - scargle plot is @xmath17  s @xcite .",
    "obviously , this peak covers both oscillations found by us .    because the period @xmath18 coincides with the lesser of two periods found by @xcite in x - rays ( @xmath4  s )",
    ", we can definitely conclude that @xmath18 is the spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "we believe that @xcite give rms errors .",
    "our observations eliminate an ambiguity , which arose from the analysis of x - ray observations made by @xcite , who found a different spin period , namely @xmath8  s. obviously , their measurement of the spin period is incorrect .",
    "the period @xmath19 is most probably the orbital sideband .",
    "it also coincides with the second period found by @xcite in x - rays , namely @xmath5  s. @xcite also interpreted the second period as the orbital sideband .",
    "the precise knowledge of the spin and sideband periods allows us to calculate the precise value of @xmath6 , which is equal to @xmath13  h. this @xmath6 agrees with a rough evaluation of @xmath6 made by @xcite from the spin and sideband periods observed in x - rays . according to @xcite , @xmath6 must be 2.7  h. our evaluation of @xmath6 also agrees with @xmath6 evaluated by @xcite from x - ray intensity variations ( @xmath20  h ) and from radial velocities of two observations taken separately ( @xmath21 and @xmath22  h ) .",
    "we also believe that @xcite give rms errors . however , the combined observations of the radial velocities obtained by @xcite give a contradictive value of @xmath6 , namely @xmath7  h. as @xcite themselves recognize , the combined observations suffer from aliases , and , therefore , this value of @xmath6 may be incorrect .",
    "thus , our observations confirms v515  and is an ip inside the 23  h period gap .",
    "although the precise coincidence of the peak in the power spectrum with the calculated @xmath6 along with the signs of the coherence of the corresponding oscillation gives evidence of the reality of the orbital variability , this variability is hardly discoverable .",
    "this fact allows us to constrain the orbital inclination of the system .",
    "the orbital inclination has to be less than about @xmath23 because , otherwise , it might be easily detected due to changes of the visibility of the hot spot or eclipses ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "v515  and reveals interesting features of the pulse profiles of the detected short - period oscillations .",
    "the oscillation with the spin period ( @xmath18 ) shows a stable smooth asymmetric pulse profile , whereas the sideband oscillation ( @xmath19 ) reveals significant changes of the pulse profile from a quasi - sinusoidal shape to a shape somewhat resembling a light - curve of an eclipsing binary .",
    "we attempt to find plausible explanations of observed features of the pulse profiles .    in ips",
    ", the optical spin pulses can arise from the hot pole - caps , can occur through reprocessing of x - rays in the axisymmetric parts of the accretion disc and can come from the accretion curtains between the inner disc and the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the first possibility can be realized only in a very fast rotator , such as ae  aqr , in which the size of the accretion curtains is thought to be small and gives a small contribution to the flux compared to the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the second possibility can be excluded due to the low inclination of v515  and .",
    "the reprocessing requires a sufficient degree of asymmetry , e.g. between the front and the back of the disc .",
    "such asymmetry can occur only in a highly inclined system , which shows eclipses ( e.g. dq  her , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , as in most other ips , in v515  and the optical emission with @xmath9 most probably comes from the accretion curtains .",
    "two - pole disc - fed accretion is believed to be the normal mode of behaviour in ips .",
    "depending on the sizes and shapes of the accretion curtains both single - peaked and double - peaked spin pulse profiles can be produced .",
    "because these sizes and shapes depend on the magnetic field , in ips with relatively strong magnetic fields two accreting poles can act in phase so that single - picked , roughly sinusoidal pulse profiles can be produced whereas in ips with weak magnetic fields two accreting poles can act in anti - phase and produce double - peaked spin pulse profiles @xcite .",
    "it is considered that the rapidly spinning ips with @xmath24  s have weak magnetic fields and therefore usually produce double - peaked pulse profiles ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter case occurs when the geometry allows the two opposite poles to come into view to the observer ( e.g. v405  aur , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the secondary pole can be continuously hidden by the white dwarf .",
    "then the pulse profile turns out also quasi - sinusoidal .",
    "this is seen in ny  lyp where the emission from one pole only is confirmed by the narrow optical emission lines @xcite .",
    "v515  and has @xmath9 much less than 700  s and , in spite of this , shows a quasi - sinusoidal pulse profile . hence , we must conclude that the secondary pole is continuously hidden by the white dwarf like ny lyp .",
    "the absence of the first harmonic of the oscillation with @xmath9 also suggests that the contribution of the secondary pole acting in anti - phase is negligible .",
    "v515  and clearly reveals significant asymmetry of the quasi - sinusoidal spin pulse profile ( the right - hand part of fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ) .",
    "this asymmetry seems most difficult for explanation and may be caused by the asymmetry of the accretion curtains .",
    "such an asymmetry can arise due to the interaction of the accretion flow and the magnetic field of the white dwarf when the white dwarf is not in spin equilibrium @xcite .",
    "thus , in v515  and the asymmetric spin pulse profile can be produced in one asymmetric accretion curtain , where this asymmetry may be caused by non - equilibrium spinning .    in the case of disc - fed accretion",
    "the optical orbital sideband arises due to reprocessing of x - rays by structures rotating in the reference frame connected with the orbital motion .",
    "pulse profiles of the sideband oscillation often reveal significant variability .",
    "changes of the structure of the accretion disc are considered to be plausible reasons for such variability . however , these changes are not accompanied by noticeable variability of the star brightness @xcite . in v515  and we also did not find appreciable brightness changes between 2008 and 2009 when a significant change of the pulse profile of the sideband oscillation occurred ( the left - hand part of fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ) . in ips ,",
    "the accretion disc is much brighter than the secondary star and white dwarf ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it seems strange how the accretion disc can change its structure without appreciable brightness changes .",
    "another way to produce the orbital sideband is alternation of the accretion flow between two poles of the white dwarf with the sideband frequency .",
    "this process occurs in cases of stream - fed and disc - overflow accretion and is the only way to produce the orbital sideband in x - rays @xcite . because the disc - overflow accretion and disc - fed accretion are compatible and can co - exist in an ip simultaneously",
    ", the change of the contribution between them can probably produce significant variations of the pulse profile of a sideband oscillation .",
    "@xcite observed the orbital sideband of v515  and in x - rays , and this was the sign of a disc - overflow accretion @xcite . but @xcite observed no x - ray sideband .",
    "this is the indication that in v515  and the proportion between the disc - fed and disc - overflow accretion can change .",
    "therefore , we can account for the significant change of the pulse profile of the sideband oscillation , which we observed in v515  and , by the change of the contribution between the two accretion modes .",
    "it is interesting that a similar change of the pulse profile of the sideband oscillation , namely a variation from a quasi - sinusoidal pulse profile to a pulse profile resembling a light - curve of an eclipsing binary , we observed in mu  cam ( see fig . 6 in @xcite ) , where the change between the two accretion modes was also observed @xcite .",
    "this change in mu  cam was accompanied by a large change in optical brightness .",
    "although we observed no appreciable brightness changes of v515  and between 2008 and 2009 , the change of the contribution between the two accretion modes in this cv seems yet possible because the disc - overflow accretion can amount to only a small part of the full accretion . note that a x - ray sideband signal is detected in fo  aqr , for which a 2 per cent disc overflow fraction has been estimated @xcite",
    "obviously , the change of the full accretion at a 2 per cent level can not produce appreciable brightness changes .",
    "@xcite used a model of magnetic accretion to investigate the spin equilibria of magnetic cvs .",
    "this allowed them to infer approximate values for the magnetic moments of most known ips .",
    "many authors used their fig . 2 to evaluate the magnetic moments of newly discovered ips ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our attempts , however , turned out unsuccessful due to the fact that the @xmath25 ratio for v515  and , which is equal to 0.047 , is found below the lines denoting the spin equilibria for @xmath6 = 3  h or less on fig . 2 in @xcite we attempted to find the solution of this problem by changing the mass ratio because the model calculations of @xcite were made only for the mass ratio @xmath26 . by using dependence ( 11 ) in @xcite or dependence ( 3 ) in @xcite , we found that a @xmath25 ratio of 0.047 can intersect the corresponding equilibrium line only if the mass ratio @xmath27 is larger than 1.5 .",
    "but such a mass ratio is impossible for an ordinary cv .    using the ritter and kolb catalogue of cvs @xcite and the ip home page ( mukai  k. , http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/koji.mukai/iphome )",
    ", we found 13 possible ips with @xmath28  h. among them v515  and is one of the most rapidly spinning ips .",
    "only wz  sge and v455  and have shorter oscillation periods of 27.87 and 67.2  s , accordingly .",
    "these two stars , however , show additional oscillations with close periods @xcite , and therefore their extremely short periods may be caused by white dwarf pulsations rather than spin of a magnetic white dwarf .",
    "in addition , these short periods were not confirmed by x - ray observations .",
    "if we exclude wz  sge and v455  and from the group of ips with @xmath28  h then it turns out that v515  and is the most rapidly spinning ip with the shortest @xmath25 ratio in this group .",
    "obviously , this peculiarity does not allow us to estimate the magnetic moment of the white dwarf by using fig . 2 in @xcite .",
    "thus , we can conclude that either v515  and has an unusually low magnetic moment of less than @xmath29  g  @xmath30 , which is not embraced by the model calculations , or it substantially deviates from spin equilibrium .",
    "substantial deviations from spin equilibrium can be detected by measuring of spin - up or spin - down from long - term photometric observations involving an ephemeris with a long shelf life .",
    "our oscillation ephemerises are good for this task .",
    "let us estimate the observational coverage that might result in measurable values of @xmath31 for v515  and .",
    "from table  1 in @xcite we learned that for ips spinning with moderate speed ( i.e. excluding ae  aqr and dq  her ) the detection threshold of @xmath31 is about @xmath32 .",
    "if we suppose that v515  and possesses such @xmath31 , then this leads to changes of oscillation phases of about 10  s per year .",
    "in table  [ table4 ] one can see that the random deviations of the oscillation phases from the ephemeris of the oscillation with @xmath18 , which has stable pulse profile , do not exceed 7  s when the phases are measured from folded light - curves obtained over a few long nights .",
    "thus , it seems possible to detect spin - up or spin - down in v515  and by observing it over a few long nights per year and by performing these observations during several years .",
    "1 .   we performed extensive photometric observations of v515  and over 33 nights in 2008 and 2009 . 2 .",
    "the analysis of these data allowed us to clearly detect two coherent oscillations with the periods @xmath15  s and @xmath16  s , which may be the spin period and orbital sideband .",
    "these two oscillations imply the orbital period of the system is equal to @xmath13  h. this confirms v515  and is in the period gap .",
    "4 .   the oscillation with @xmath18 has a stable smooth asymmetric pulse profile with a nearly linear slow increase to maximum and with a sinuous fast decline to minimum whereas the pulse profile of the oscillation with @xmath19 reveal significant changes from a quasi - sinusoidal shape to a shape somewhat resembling a light - curve of an eclipsing binary with flat maxima and relatively sharp minima .",
    "v515  and is one of the most rapidly spinning intermediate polars with @xmath28  h and may be not in spin equilibrium .",
    ".   the high accuracy of the oscillation periods , which was achieved due to the large observation coverage and the low noise level in the power spectra , allowed us to obtain the oscillation ephemerises with a formal shelf life of about 100 yr .",
