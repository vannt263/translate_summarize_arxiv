    "the profile of the incoherent background ( centered at e  =  0 ) and the excitation signal were fitted by gauss - peaks .",
    "the line widths are consistent with the expected instrument resolution .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the in - plane mode has a much larger scattering amplitude ( @xmath84 times ) than the out - of - plane mode .",
    "nevertheless , the in - plane mode from domain a can not be detected , because @xmath56 is parallel to @xmath85 ( see fig .",
    "[ spinstruct0 ] ) .",
    "thus , only the in - plane modes from domains b and c should be visible .",
    "this was probed by a separate measurement in a horizontal magnetic field . in zero field",
    "all three magnetic domains of the crystal have approximately the same size .",
    "the relative volume parts of the different domains can be varied by applying an external magnetic field perpendicular to the c - axis @xcite . a horizontal field parallel to @xmath86 stabilizes domain a by the possibility of a slight spin canting .",
    "this is shown by the increasing intensity of the ( 0.5,0,0 ) bragg reflection , when increasing the magnetic field ( insert of fig .",
    "[ magdat ] ) . at a field of about 700  gauss only domain a remains .",
    "higher fields give rise to an increased spin canting , leading to a paramagnetic phase above 3000  gauss .",
    "figure  [ magdat ] shows the spin wave excitation at * q *  =  ( 0.7,0,0 ) ( * q *  =  ( 0.3,0,0 ) ) for three different small magnetic fields .",
    "the narrow windows of the used cryomagnet limited the final energy to the value @xmath87  mev ( @xmath88@xmath89 ) ( collimation :  ng-40-40-40 ) .",
    "thus , the resolution was lower in this experiment compared to the zero field measurements performed with @xmath90  mev ( @xmath91 ) . obviously , the increase in the magnetic field reduces the intensity of the excitation , which confirms that the excitations at @xmath92 arise from the magnetic domains b and c.    for measuring the in - plane - mode in domain a , one has to use a momentum transfer * q * not parallel to the @xmath86-axis ( @xmath93-direction ) .",
    "this was done by choosing @xmath94 ( the size of the magnetic brillouin zone in @xmath95 direction is twice the size of the crystalline brillouin zone ) .",
    "unfortunately , the high q values restricted @xmath96 to large values ( @xmath80  mev ;  @xmath97 ) .",
    "this caused a coarse resolution compared to the measurement at @xmath98 even with a better collimation ( ng-202020 ) .",
    "the measurement at @xmath99 ( * q *  =  ( 0.2,0,0 ) ) is shown in ( fig .",
    "[ rawdat2 ] ) . at first glance",
    ", there seems to be just one excitation at about 0.15 mev .",
    "however , knowing the existence of an excitation at 0.118 mev from the measurement at @xmath83 it is possible to fit a second excitation at 0.175(5 ) mev .",
    "the fit includes : two gaussian peaks with fixed energy ( @xmath1000.118 mev ) , one gaussian peak for the incoherent background ( e  =  0  mev ) and one gaussian peak for the second excitation .",
    "the widths of the different gaussians were fitted independently .",
    "as for the measurements at @xmath73 , the line widths are caused by instrument resolution .",
    "all other measurements at ( @xmath101,0,2 ) were treated in the same way , except the measurement at ( 0.6,0,2 ) where the widths of all gaussians were set equal .",
    "the calculation of the dispersion relation was performed for the spin configuration of domain a. for comparison of the measured data with the theory , it is convenient to transform the signals from domains b and c to equivalent points in domain a. this can be done simply by rotations of the reciprocal lattice through @xmath102 , which change the measured @xmath103 positions from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "the data obtained from the measurements at @xmath74 belong already to domain a.    all measured data points of the dispersion relation are plotted in fig .",
    "( [ dispfig ] ) . the theoretical dispersion relation derived in section ii ( eq .",
    "( [ dispequat ] ) ) was fitted to these experimental data .",
    "the fit included just two free parameters : the value of the interchain exchange interaction @xmath6 and the easy - plane - anisotropy @xmath20 .",
    "good agreement between theory and experiment can be obtained with the values :      the determined value of @xmath6 is consistent with the condition for the stability of the ground state ( eq .  ( [ stab ] ) ) .",
    "it turns out that csnif@xmath0 is far away from the transitions mentioned in section i , and thus neglecting higher order terms in the holstein - primakoff transformation is expected to be a a reliable low - temperature approximation .",
    "the value for the easy - plane - anisotropy @xmath20 of 3.3  k is lower than an earlier value ( @xmath107  k ) , determined from neutron scattering experiments using a linear spin wave theory above t@xmath108 .",
    "the actual difference is even larger , because the new value represents the pure crystal field anisotropy , while in the old measurements the effect of the intrachain dipolar interaction was not separated from the single site anisotropy .",
    "@xmath109 is an effective anisotropy .",
    "to compare these two values one has to calculate the dipolar anisotropy @xmath110 in isolated spin chains , which leads to @xmath111  k. the calculation of d is possible by assuming a strictly ferromagnetic ordering of the spins along the magnetic chain .",
    "the good convergence of dipolar sums in one dimension , causes this value to be reached even for short - range ordered chains .",
    "the easy - axis - type dipolar anisotropy @xmath110 has to be added to the easy - plane pure crystal field anisotropy @xmath20 to give the old value of @xmath112  k. thus , the value for @xmath20 from the measurements at @xmath113 is @xmath114  k. a possible source of this difference is the neglect of the dipolar inter - chain interaction in the model used in the temperature range above t@xmath108 .",
    "maybe , an independent determination of @xmath20 by measuring the dispersion relation along the c - direction in the long - range ordered antiferromagnetic state ( @xmath115 ) is necessary to solve this problem .",
    "the influence of each parameter of the heisenberg  hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) on the dispersion relation is directly visible at characteristic points of the brillouin zone . inserting eq .",
    "( [ jstrichq ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ dispequat ] ) gives the following expressions for the excitation energies at the * q*positions of @xmath116 , p , x and s : @xmath117 the values of the gap at the point @xmath116 are determined by the single ion anisotropy and the dipolar interaction .",
    "the in - plane mode e@xmath118 exhibits a gap even without dipolar terms , but the gap of the out - of - plane mode e@xmath119 vanishes in case of no dipolar interaction .",
    "two features of the dispersion relation are very unusual , and demonstrate the strong influence of the dipolar interaction in csnif@xmath0 : the position of the minimum of the dispersion relation and the jump of the dispersion relation at the brillouin zone center .",
    "contrary to common spin wave dispersion relations the energy minimum is not found at the magnetic zone center , but near the magnetic brillouin zone boundary .",
    "this is due to the strong anisotropy of the dipolar interaction and the competition of the dipolar and exchange interaction .",
    "the jump in the dispersion relation at the zone center @xmath116 as shown in fig .",
    "( [ dispfig ] ) can be viewed at in a similar way as the well known splitting of the longitudinal and transverse optical phonon modes in polar crystals .",
    "the lo  to  splitting is caused by electric long - range dipolar interactions .",
    "this is used , for instance , for the derivation of the lyddane ",
    "sachs  teller relation in solid state physics textbooks ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the splitting is a result of the semi - convergence of dipole sums in homogeneously polarized systems .",
    "this gives rise to a depolarization field for longitudinal phonons with long wavelength , but not for transverse modes .",
    "similar arguments are valid for spin waves in csnif@xmath0 . here , not only the large influence of the dipolar interaction is important , but also the planar anisotropy , leading to a linear polarized dynamic magnetization in the out - of - plane and in - plane modes .",
    "this allows to describe the in - plane mode in analogy to phonons as `` longitudinal '' or `` transverse '' spin wave , depending on the angle between dynamic magnetization ( @xmath120-direction ) and propagation direction of the wave ( fig .",
    "[ magpat ] ) . in common notation",
    "both are transverse spin fluctuations in respect to the spin orientation . as in the case of phonons ,",
    "the `` longitudinal '' spin waves have the highest energy ( wave propagation along @xmath120 ) . in the observed plane of the q - space ( @xmath121 )",
    "the out - of - plane mode is `` transverse '' for all spin wave propagation directions .",
    "thus , the dispersion relation of this mode exhibits no jump at @xmath116 .    in summary",
    "it is shown , that the description of the spin system of csnif@xmath0 including long - range dipolar interactions gives a convincing explanation for the unusual antiferromagnetic structure and spin dynamics .",
    "especially , peculiar features of the spin wave dispersion relation can only be explained by a strong influence of long - range dipolar interactions in csnif@xmath0 .",
    "the jump of the spin wave dispersion relation at the zone center has been so far observed only in very few ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "csnif@xmath0 is the first antiferromagnet exhibiting this feature .",
    "this is caused by special properties of the one dimensional spin system csnif@xmath0 .",
    "firstly , the strong 1d ferromagnetic order leads to a dipolar interchain interaction in the same order as the weak exchange interaction @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , the planar anisotropy enforces a special spin dynamic , which gives rise to a dynamical magnetization pattern in long - wavelength spin waves .",
    "this demonstrated once again that low dimensional magnets are very suitable model systems to study a wide range of fundamental magnetic properties .",
    "the lower bound for the exchange energy results from the instability of the spectrum at wave vector @xmath122 . a detailed investigation which will be published in a subsequent paper@xcite ,",
    "shows that the system will pass through an incommensurate phase at slightly greater values for @xmath6 .",
    "this does not affect the results of this paper ."
