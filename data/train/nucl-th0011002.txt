    "in this work , we make exploratory calculations of the effects of higher shell admixtures on nuclear properties .",
    "we will focus on the static electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments of the excited states of even - even nuclei .",
    "we shall use @xmath5 as a kind of playing field to see if any new or interesting phenomena emerge .",
    "of course , @xmath5 is of interest in its own right , and experimental measurements of its excited states may become feasible in the near future .",
    "why @xmath5 ?",
    "first of all , it is light enough that we @xmath15 do shell model calculations with higher shell admixtures .",
    "secondly , because this is a nucleus for which @xmath16 , some non - trivial aspects emerge .",
    "for instance , whereas in @xmath17 the magnetic moment of the @xmath11 state is isoscalar and hence less sensitive to the details of the nucleon wave function , in @xmath5 one also picks up isovector terms which are very sensitive to such details .    in doing the higher shell calculations",
    ", we would like to distinguish between expected effects and surprising effects .",
    "an example of the former is the fact that quadrupole properties such as @xmath18 get enhanced by higher shell admixtures .",
    "indeed , the justification for using effective @xmath19 charges in a valence space comes from perturbative calculations in which @xmath20 admixtures are allowed .",
    "but , as we will see in the following sections , there are some new and less obvious effects .",
    "we call this work exploratory in part because we hope that , although we limit our calculations to @xmath5 , ideas will emerge that will be relevant to other nuclei .",
    "also , since we limit our excitations to @xmath20 , we can not be sure what even higher shell admixtures will do .",
    "we shall use the interaction @xmath0 , where    @xmath21    ( we do not include @xmath22 terms ) , and where @xmath1 is a two - body spin - orbit interaction that was introduced by zheng and zamick @xcite . the interactions @xmath23 and @xmath1 have been previously used in various calculations @xcite . for @xmath24 , zheng and zamick got the best fit to @xmath25 matrix elements of realistic interactions , but it has been found that several properties in the nuclear medium could be better fit with @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we do @xmath27 introduce a one - body spin - orbit term .",
    "rather , the spin - orbit splitting is implicitly generated by the two - body spin - orbit interaction .",
    "furthermore , we will fix the strength @xmath28 of the @xmath23 interaction so that , when used in the hamiltonian given above with the spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath2 taken to be equal to its standard of @xmath24 , the excitation energy of the first @xmath11 state comes out to be closest to the experimental value of 3.368 @xmath29 .",
    "this is achieved by taking @xmath30 in the valence space calculations and @xmath31 in the ( 0 + 2 ) @xmath7 calculations .",
    "we will then study the effects of varying @xmath2 on the static electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states .      for @xmath8 in the valence space , we get the wigner supermultiplet limit of the @xmath32 shell as nicely discussed in the book by hammermesh @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in that limit",
    ", the first @xmath11 state of @xmath5 is doubly degenerate with quantum numbers [ 420 ] .",
    "we can also use the @xmath33 quantum numbers @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , the double degeneracy comes from any wigner plus majorana interaction , of which @xmath23 is a special case .    from the point of view of the rotational model ,",
    "the @xmath3 state is a member of the @xmath9 ground state band , and the @xmath4 state is the lowest member of a @xmath10 band .",
    "they both have the same @xmath35 electric quadrupole moment @xmath36 , but they have equal and opposite @xmath37 electric quadrupole moments @xmath38 .",
    "this can be seen from the rotational formula @xcite    @xmath39}{(i+1)(2i+3 ) } q_0\\ ] ]    thus , the small @xmath2 limit is characterised by @xmath40 and by @xmath41 .    experimentally ,",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states are @xmath27 degenerate .",
    "the @xmath3 state is at 3.368 @xmath29 , and the @xmath4 state is at nearly twice the excitation energy of 5.960 @xmath29 .",
    "undoubtedly , this is due to the importance of the spin - orbit interaction , and hence the need to include the latter in our hamiltonian , if only to reproduce energy levels that are close to experiment .",
    "when the spin - orbit splitting becomes very large , one gets the @xmath42 coupling limit in the small space .",
    "the wave function for @xmath5 is then    @xmath43    note that the neutron shell is closed in this limit and therefore the contribution of the neutrons to the quadrupole moment @xmath38 and to the magnetic moment @xmath44 is zero .",
    "the value of @xmath38 for the two protons is also zero .",
    "this is a rather special case where the numbers of holes in the @xmath45 shell equals the number of particles . in general ,    @xmath46",
    "the only way this can be satisfied for @xmath47 is if @xmath38 is zero .",
    "this is a peculiarity of our choice of @xmath5 as the playing field .",
    "but it gives us a bonus in that we have a very simple limit at large @xmath2 which will guide us as we go from small to large @xmath2 .",
    "as for the magnetic dipole moment , it is easy to evaluate its value in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "we simply have two @xmath45 protons coupled to @xmath48 , and using the schmidt value for a single proton @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50    we have for the @xmath51 @xmath48 configuration    @xmath52    yielding @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "this will also be a useful guide in our discussion below , but we must remember that all the above limits are for valence space calculations .",
    "in table i , we present the results of electric quadrupole moment calculations for various values of @xmath2 , the strength of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we give the results in the small space in table ia and in the large space in table ib .",
    "we also show the excitation energies of the two @xmath11 states , as well as the values of the electric quadrupole transition amplitudes @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , in tables iia and iib , we give the corresponding magnetic dipole moments @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states",
    ".    we also illustrate the results in various figures as follows . in fig . 1 , we give the electric quadrupole moment of the @xmath3 state versus @xmath2 as calculated in the small and large spaces . in fig .",
    "2 we give the small - space results for @xmath12 and @xmath13 versus @xmath2 , and in fig .",
    "3 we give the corresponding large - space results .    in figures 4 , 5 and 6",
    "we present a comparison of the magnetic dipole moment @xmath14 as calculated in the small and large model spaces , as a function of @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "4 we have @xmath60 , in fig",
    ". 5 @xmath61 , and in fig . 6 @xmath62 .      in fig . 1",
    ", we see a large difference in the behaviour of the electric quadrupole moment @xmath12 of the @xmath3 state versus @xmath2 , especially for @xmath65 . in the small space",
    "[ @xmath66 , the behaviour is much simpler .",
    "@xmath12 is always negative , as we would expect for a prolate nucleus ( with a positive intrinsic quadrupole moment @xmath36 ) .",
    "we have noted previously that , in the @xmath42 coupling limit , @xmath12 should vanish , so it is not surprising to find that for the most part ( except near @xmath8 ) the value of @xmath38 decreases steadily from about -4 @xmath67 towards zero as @xmath2 increases .    in the large space ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath12 starts out large and positive ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "it then decreases and goes through zero at @xmath69 , reaches a negative value of about @xmath70 at @xmath26 , and then starts decreasing to zero . why are the results in the small and large space so different ?",
    "let us first look at the large @xmath2 behaviour .",
    "the fact that the magnitude of ( negative ) @xmath12 is larger in the large space is understandable .",
    "the effects of including @xmath20 admixtures is precisely to change bare @xmath19 charges to effective charges .",
    "a popular choice of effective charges is @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the proton and the neutron , respectively . in the calculations",
    ", one does not necessarily get exactly these values , but the trend is in that direction .",
    "certainly the isoscalar @xmath19 gets enhanced . not only @xmath12 but",
    "also @xmath73 should get enhanced if this effective charge argument is correct . from table",
    "i , we see that for say @xmath26 @xmath73 is 18.19 @xmath74 in the small space , but is equal to 42.63 @xmath74 in the large space .",
    "this then supports the effective charge argument .",
    "however , at small @xmath2 the quadrupole moments are of opposite sign in the small and large spaces . recall that in the small space , at @xmath8 , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states are degenerate .",
    "we can arrange the two states so that one is a @xmath75 state and the other @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath18 to the first state should be much larger than to the second .",
    "the two states have the same intrinsic quadrupole moment in the rotational model , and hence equal and opposite quadrupole moments in the laboratory .",
    "if we turn on the spin - orbit interaction very weakly , the lower energy state is clearly dominantly @xmath9 and the upper one @xmath10 .",
    "for example , for @xmath77 , the values are : @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , whilst for the higher state @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "there is a small amount of @xmath84 mixing due to the spin- orbit interaction , but not very much .    in the large space , what appears to be happening right off the bat at @xmath8 is that a state which is dominantly @xmath10 is lying lower in energy than one which is dominantly @xmath9 .",
    "this is evident from the corresponding values for the ( 0 + 2 ) @xmath7 properties of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states obtained with @xmath8 :    @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 + @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "as we turn on the spin - orbit interaction , a more normal behaviour starts to be restored , one in which @xmath73 is much larger .",
    "the reason that at @xmath8 the @xmath76 state lies lower than the @xmath75 is not clear",
    ". it must be due to @xmath20 mixing from the quadrupole- quadrupole interaction .",
    "such mixing does not maintain the @xmath33 symmetry of the elliott hamiltonian ( although in first order perturbation theory all that happens is that the strength of the @xmath23 interaction gets renormalized , so that in that approximation one would still get elliott s formula for the energies , and in particular the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states of @xmath5 could still be degenerate . here , however , we are @xmath27 doing first order perturbation theory , but rather exact ( 0 + 2 ) @xmath7 matrix diagonalization ) .      there are some surprises for the static magnetic dipole moments as well . as seen in fig",
    "6 , whereas in the small space the magnetic moment of the @xmath3 state increases steadily with @xmath2 ( and as mentioned previously approaches 5.057 @xmath92 as @xmath93 ) , in the large space @xmath14 starts out small and positive but decreases to almost zero at @xmath94 , where there is a near cancellation between the spin and orbital parts of the magnetic moment .",
    "the negative values of @xmath60 from @xmath8 to @xmath26 obviously come from the neutrons . at @xmath8 ,",
    "@xmath95 must be zero because in the wigner supermultiplet theory the @xmath3 state has @xmath96 .",
    "as @xmath2 goes to infinity , we approach the @xmath42 coupling limit , and the neutrons will not contribute to @xmath95 because they form an @xmath96 closed neutron @xmath45 subshell .",
    "only the protons will contribute , in that limit , and @xmath95 for @xmath45 protons is positive .",
    "hence , only for some intermediate values of @xmath2 will the neutrons contribution to @xmath95 be able to dominate .    for large @xmath2 ,",
    "the results are somewhat easier to understand .",
    "the fact that @xmath97 can be understood by the fact that the higher shell admixtures renormalize and considerably enhance the effective strength of the @xmath23 interaction in the valence space .",
    "this makes the ratio @xmath98 of the spin - orbit strength to the @xmath23 strength effectively smaller .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , the value of @xmath99 for a given @xmath2 in fig .",
    "4 should be compared with a value of @xmath100 for a smaller @xmath2 ( say @xmath101 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath95 will then be much closer .",
    "alternatively , one could use a larger value of @xmath28 in the small space calculation in order to make the comparison with the large space calculation for the same @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath102 in the small space is remarkably constant as a function of @xmath2 , with a value of about @xmath103 .",
    "however , in the large space and at @xmath8 this quantity is much smaller ( @xmath104 ) . as @xmath2 increases",
    ", @xmath102 also increases , and for large @xmath2 , the values in small and large spaces are almost the same .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is known to give @xmath84 mixing and therefore to bring many complications to analyses which start from the point of view of the rotational model .",
    "ironically , here , the spin - orbit interaction with sufficient strength simplifies things .",
    "it brings down in energy the expected dominantly @xmath105 prolate state , the signatures of which are a strong @xmath18 transition from the ground state and a large negative electric quadrupole moment .    summarizing this section , we can say that when the coupling of the spin - orbit interaction is sufficiently strong , things tend to settle down .      as we increase @xmath2 from zero to 2 in the small space , nothing unusual happens to @xmath12 .",
    "it has a large negative value for @xmath8 , consistent with the @xmath33 limit and with a prolate nucleus .",
    "the value of @xmath12 then gradually approaches zero as @xmath2 approaches infinity , as expected from the discussion of the @xmath42 coupling limit in the previous section .    in the large space ,",
    "the behaviour is drastically different .",
    "now @xmath38 starts out _ positive _ , goes through zero at about @xmath94 and then becomes negative . for large @xmath2 ,",
    "the behaviour is less surprising .",
    "the curves for both small and large spaces seem to be going to zero . the fact that @xmath107 for large @xmath2 is consistent with the fact that core polarization enhances @xmath38 and @xmath18 @xmath108 it gives a microscopic justification for using effective charges .",
    "getting back to the critical region of @xmath69 , we find that not only @xmath12 but also @xmath13 becomes very small in magnitude , and likewise @xmath14 .",
    "we can perhaps explain why both @xmath38 s become small at the same time by noting that in the @xmath33 limit , the two states @xmath3 and @xmath4 are degenerate and have equal and opposite quadrupole moments .",
    "in the rotational model , both the @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath48 states have the same _ intrinsic _ quadrupole moment @xmath36 , but the geometric factors cause the laboratory @xmath38 s to be equal and opposite .",
    "let us suppose that the spin - orbit interaction mixes the @xmath9 and @xmath10 states :    @xmath109    @xmath110    then    @xmath111    @xmath112    suppose now that @xmath113 is negligible and that @xmath114 , we then have    @xmath115    and    @xmath116    and if we have equal mixing @xmath108 @xmath117 we get    @xmath118    to support this @xmath84-mixing argument , we should examine the values of the electric quadrupole transitions @xmath73 and @xmath119 .",
    "if there were @xmath120 @xmath84-mixing , the @xmath18 to the @xmath105 state should be much stronger than to the @xmath121 state .",
    "if there @xmath122 strong @xmath84-mixing , the @xmath18 s to both states should be comparable .    before looking at the critical region ( @xmath69 ) ,",
    "let us look at the large space results for a value of @xmath2 that gives the best energies for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath26 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 , and the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are -5.039 @xmath67 and 5.384 @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the lowest state being dominantly @xmath9 and the upper one @xmath10 , and is probably very close to the @xmath125 situation , not only for @xmath5 but for most strongly deformed nuclei .",
    "support to this is given by looking at the calculated @xmath18 s .",
    "we find that @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "below the critical @xmath2 , say at @xmath77 , we have the reverse situation , with @xmath12 positive , @xmath13 negative ( 5.345 and -5.230 @xmath67 respectively ) , and @xmath128 while @xmath129 .",
    "clearly then , there is a cross - over around @xmath69 or so . as mentioned above ,",
    "the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 nearly vanish in the critical region @xmath69 ( they are -0.034 and 0.278 @xmath67 respectively ) . what about the @xmath18 s ?",
    "the values of these are 24.39 @xmath74 to the @xmath3 state and 23.07 @xmath74 to the @xmath4 state , nearly equal indeed .",
    "this lends a clear support to the strong @xmath84-mixing argument .",
    "the fact that @xmath14 also nearly vanishes where @xmath12 and @xmath13 do is probably coincidental . for the magnetic dipole moment",
    "we find that the spin and orbital contributions nearly cancel in the vicinity of @xmath94 . as mentioned before",
    ", @xmath95 vanishes at @xmath8 . for small , finite @xmath2",
    ", the neutrons tend to dominate to give a negative @xmath95 . at very large @xmath2 however , and at least in the small space , the neutrons again do not contribute because they form a closed @xmath45 subshell .",
    "some of the results that we have obtained are expected , but some are at least at first thought surprising .    the wigner supermultiplet theory , and as a special case @xmath33 , predicts results that are in disagreement with experiment both in the valence space and the valence plus 2 @xmath7 space . in the small space , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) are predicted to be degenerate , whereas experimentally the @xmath4 state is at about @xmath130 the excitation energy of the @xmath3 state ( 3.368 @xmath29 and 5.960 @xmath29 , respectively ) . turning on a sufficiently strong spin - orbit interaction ( @xmath131 to 1.5 ) corrects this situation , and furthermore the lower state is dominantly @xmath9 with a strong @xmath18 from the ground state , and the upper one is dominantly @xmath10 with a weak @xmath18 from the ground state .    in the large space ,",
    "the situation is even worse in the absence of a spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the lowest state is dominantly @xmath10 and the upper one is @xmath9 .",
    "as we turn on the spin - orbit interaction , one first gets a crossover in the properties of the lowest @xmath11 state : at about @xmath94 one gets about equal mixing of @xmath9 and @xmath10 with the result that the electric quadrupole moments @xmath12 and @xmath13 both nearly vanish . in other regions of @xmath2 they are both large in magnitude and nearly equal but opposite in sign .",
    "as we increase @xmath2 further , we slowly converge to the experimental situation ( at @xmath132 ) where the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states are split by about 3 @xmath29 and the @xmath18 to the @xmath3 state is much stronger than to the @xmath4 state .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "1 we see that for the realistic value near @xmath26 we are safely away from the crossover region near @xmath94 . but",
    "this example suggests that in other nuclei and at other excitation energies , there may be two states of the same angular momentum but with different @xmath84 or other quantum numbers . in that case",
    ", it appears that one can get unexpected and different effects in a valence space calculation as compared with one in which 2 @xmath7 excitations are allowed .",
    "for example , as noted here in the small space calculation with @xmath133 , we have @xmath134 and @xmath135 , whereas in the large space the values are @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "these are drastically different values and the difference can not be considered to be the result of perturbative corrections .",
    "likewise , for the magnetic dipole moments in the valence space we have at @xmath133 @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , whereas in the large space the corresponding values are -0.387 , 0.462 and 0.0753 @xmath92",
    ".    when we go to larger @xmath2 , things are not completely chaotic .",
    "we expect that 2 @xmath7 admixtures will cause electric quadrupole moments and @xmath18 s to be enhanced , according to the effective charge argument that was given previously .",
    "let us arbitrarily define an electric quadrupole moment enhancement factor as @xmath141/@xmath142 .",
    "the values of this enhancement factor for @xmath143 and 2.0 are respectively 1.41 , 1.99 , 2.45 , 2.76 and 2.93",
    ". we should remember that in the small space @xmath12 approaches 0 as @xmath2 becomes very large ( @xmath42 limit ) and this is the reason the enhancement factor , as defined above , increases with @xmath2 .",
    "let us now consider the corresponding @xmath18 enhancement factor @xmath144/@xmath145 .",
    "the values of this factor for the same values of @xmath2 as above are respectively 2.05 , 2.27 , 2.34 , 2.28 and 2.15 .",
    "one might at first expect the @xmath18 enhancement factors to be the squares of ( and hence much larger than ) the quadrupole enhancement factors , but in fact they are smaller .    in summary",
    ", we have found some surprising behaviour which , given the large number of nuclei in the periodic table and the large number of excited states , may actually be realized . for @xmath5 , we feel that we are realistically in a region of @xmath2 where , although the effects of higher shell admixtures are very substantial , leading to large @xmath19 enhancements and large magnetic dipole suppressions , the results are under control .",
    "but it may be possible that for other nuclei we have , for example , nearly degenerate @xmath9 and @xmath10 states such that the higher shell admixtures lead to very surprising results .",
    "the examples given in this work are the fact that @xmath12 and @xmath13 nearly vanish at @xmath69 in the large space , whereas in the small space they are large and nearly equal and opposite .",
    "the near vanishing of @xmath146 at @xmath69 in the large space , and the fact that it takes a long time before @xmath61 achieves its full value , are two other examples .",
