    "<S> we address the use of simple quantum probes for the spectral characterization of classical noisy environments . in our scheme </S>",
    "<S> a qubit interacts with a classical stochastic field describing environmental noise and is then measured after a given interaction time in order to estimate the characteristic parameters of the noise . in particular , we address estimation of the spectral parameters of two relevant kinds of non - gaussian noise : random telegraph noise with lorentzian spectrum and colored noise with @xmath0 spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze in details the estimation precision achievable by quantum probes and prove that population measurement on the qubit is optimal for noise estimation in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate the optimal interaction times for the quantum probe , i.e. the values maximizing the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) and the quantum signal - to - noise ratio . for random telegraph noise </S>",
    "<S> the qfi is inversely proportional to the square of the switching rate , meaning that the quantum signal - to - noise ratio is constant and thus the switching rate may be uniformly estimated with the same precision in its whole range of variation . for colored noise , </S>",
    "<S> the precision achievable in the estimation of `` color '' , i.e. of the exponent @xmath1 , strongly depends on the structure of the environment , i.e. on the number of fluctuators describing the classical environment . </S>",
    "<S> for an environment modeled by a single random fluctuator estimation is more precise for pink noise , i.e. for @xmath2 , whereas by increasing the number of fluctuators , the quantum signal - to - noise ratio has two local maxima , with the largest one drifting towards @xmath3 , i.e. brown noise .    </S>",
    "<S> in any communication channel or measurement scheme , the interaction of the information carriers with the external environment introduces noise in the system , thus degrading the overall performances . the precise characterization of the noise is thus a crucial ingredient for the design of high - precision measurements and reliable communication protocols . in many physical situations , </S>",
    "<S> the main source of noise is associated to the fluctuations of bistable quantities . in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> a suitable description of the noise is given in terms of classical stochastic processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the case of phase damping , i.e. pure dephasing , it has been shown that the interaction of a quantum system with a quantum bath can be written in terms of a random unitary evolution driven by a classical stochastic process @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the characterization of classical noise is often performed by collecting a series of measurements to estimate the autocorrelation function and the spectral properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is generally time consuming and may require the control of a complex system . </S>",
    "<S> a question thus arises on whether more effective techniques may be developed . to this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we address the use of _ quantum probes _ to estimate the parameters of classical noise . </S>",
    "<S> we assume to have a quantum system interacting with the classical fluctuating field generating the noise and explore the performances of quantum measurements performed at a fixed interaction time to extract information about the classical noise . </S>",
    "<S> the power and implications of this idea are undeniable : the features of a complex system may be determined by monitoring a small probe , which is usually characterized by few and easily controllable degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest and paradigmatic example of this situation is that of a qubit interacting with a noisy environment . </S>",
    "<S> after a given interaction time , which may be suitably optimized , quantum - limited measurements on the qubit may be used to characterize the environment , e.g. to estimate the parameters describing its noise spectrum .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the characterization of two classes of classical noise : random telegraph noise ( rtn ) with lorentzian spectrum and the power - law @xmath0 _ colored _ spectra arising from the interaction with a collection of random bistable fluctuators . </S>",
    "<S> both rtn and colored noise are examples of classical non - gaussian noise occurring in several system of interest . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the microscopic models underlying these kinds of noise have been extensively analyzed in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant parameters characterizing this kinds of noise are the switching rate of the rtn and the exponent @xmath1 in the case of power - law spectra . </S>",
    "<S> both quantities do not correspond to observables in a strict sense and therefore we have to resort to indirect measurements performed on the quantum probe to infer their value . in order to optimize this inference procedure </S>",
    "<S> we employ tools from local quantum estimation theory @xcite , which have already been proved useful in the estimation of static noise parameters @xcite and in several other scenarios , as for example the estimation of quantum correlations @xcite , gaussian states @xcite , optical phase @xcite , critical systems @xcite and quantum thermometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will optimize the initial preparation of the qubit and the interaction time in order to maximize the quantum fisher information and the quantum signal - to - noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that population measurement provides optimal inference for both the noise models .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec1 ] we introduce the physical dephasing model employed throughout the paper and describe the main features of rtn and colored noise . in section [ sec2 ] </S>",
    "<S> we briefly review the main tools of quantum estimation theory , whereas in section [ sec3 ] we present our results on the precision achievable by quantum probes in the estimation of the spectral properties of noisy random environments . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec4 ] closes the paper with concluding remarks . </S>"
