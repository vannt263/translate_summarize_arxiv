    "<S> event - by - event fluctuations of produced particle multiplicities are believed to be sensitive to a deconfinement phase transition and the critical point of strongly interacting matter . </S>",
    "<S> the na49 collaboration has conducted a systematic study of various fluctuation observables . in this contribution , </S>",
    "<S> recent results on hadron ratio fluctuations in central pb+pb collisions at @xmath0 to @xmath1 are reported . </S>",
    "<S> these results are complemented by the centrality dependence of hadron ratio fluctuations at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a universal scaling was found , describing the energy and centrality dependence of the @xmath3  and @xmath4  ratio fluctuations purely by a change in the observed average hadron multiplicities . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling is broken for the fluctuations of the @xmath5  and @xmath6  ratios , possibly hinting at a change in the baryon number - strangeness correlation .    </S>",
    "<S> an event - by - event measurement of hadron ratios allows to characterize the hadro - chemical composition of the `` fireball '' of hot and dense nuclear matter created in individual heavy - ion collisions . in the vicinity of a phase transition , where the underlying degrees of freedom change , distinct fluctuation patterns in these ratios are expected </S>",
    "<S> this is substantiated by lattice qcd calculations  @xcite , that exhibit a swift change in quark number susceptibilities at the critical temperature for vanishing baryo - chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> recent results at finite @xmath7  @xcite even report diverging susceptibilities , that are possibly related to the critical point of strongly interacting matter .    </S>",
    "<S> an additional motivation to study hadron ratio fluctuations is the expected change of the baryon - strangeness correlation  @xcite at the deconfinement phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this might be reflected in the fluctuations of the k / p ratio , because kaons and protons are the major carriers of strangeness and baryon number .    </S>",
    "<S> na49  @xcite is a large acceptance fixed target hadron spectrometer at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main detectors used in the present analysis are the time projection chambers ( tpcs ) , used for tracking and particle identification ( pid ) via specific energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> their large acceptance makes event - by - event measurements possible , as a significant fraction of the produced hadrons can be observed and identified .    </S>",
    "<S> a good knowledge of this acceptance is crucial : while for inclusive measurements it is possible to extrapolate into unmeasured regions , this is not possible in the case of fluctuations . for the interpretation of fluctuation </S>",
    "<S> results it is thus important to compare to models within the same acceptance . </S>",
    "<S> for that reason tables describing the na49 acceptance are available at  @xcite , and all model comparisons reported here have been performed within this acceptance .    </S>",
    "<S> particle identification with the na49 tpcs is done in the relativistic rise region of the specific energy loss in the detector gas . </S>",
    "<S> event - wise hadron ratios are extracted with a maximum likelihood method . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of this method can be found in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scaled width of a resulting hadron ratio ( e.g.  @xmath8 ) distribution , defined as @xmath9 now contains , besides the physics correlations to be studied , additional effects from the pid method and from finite number statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the latter two are reproduced using a reference sample by subjecting mixed events to the same pid method as the data . </S>",
    "<S> the `` dynamical '' fluctuations , arising only from the physics correlations , can then be calculated as    @xmath10    @xmath11  of the @xmath4  and @xmath3  ratios was studied in central pb+pb collisions at five energies between 6.3 and 17.3 gev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figure  [ fig : exc_prpi_kpi ] , with vertical bars indicating the statistical errors , while the grey boxes represent the systematic errors determined in extensive checks of the analysis . for @xmath4  negative values of @xmath11  </S>",
    "<S> are observed , indicating a correlated production . </S>",
    "<S> the data is well described by the hadronic transport models urqmd  @xcite and hsd  @xcite with the production and strong decay of nucleon resonances as the dominating process correlating proton and pion numbers . for @xmath3  fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> positive values of @xmath11  and a rise towards low energies is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of this anticorrelation is not reproduced by the hadronic models . </S>",
    "<S> urqmd describes the high energy points , but shows only a weak change towards low energies . in hsd , </S>",
    "<S> the rise towards low energies can be observed , but the high energy points are over - predicted .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative explanation of the energy dependence however can be derived from properties of the observable @xmath11  itself . </S>",
    "<S> it can be separated  @xcite into a correlation strength term and one which is purely dependent on multiplicities . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume an invariant correlation strength , as e.g.  realized in a grand - canonical hadron resonance gas at fixed temperature and chemical potentials , only the multiplicity dependence remains . </S>",
    "<S> the general expectation from  @xcite is @xmath12 for invariant correlation strength , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the average multiplicities of the two hadron species under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling , indicated by the black lines in figure  [ fig : exc_prpi_kpi ] works surprisingly well in both cases , @xmath4  and @xmath3 .    for @xmath4  and @xmath3  in central pb+pb collisions , </S>",
    "<S> compared to results from the transport models urqmd and hsd , as well as to the multiplicity scaling described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]  for @xmath4  and @xmath3  in central pb+pb collisions , compared to results from the transport models urqmd and hsd , as well as to the multiplicity scaling described in the text.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    complementary to the energy scan , the centrality dependence of @xmath4 , @xmath3  and @xmath5  fluctuations in pb+pb collisions at the top sps energy of @xmath15  gev was studied  @xcite and is presented in figure  [ fig : allcent ] . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling properties of @xmath11  found for the energy dependence above can thus be further tested by an analysis at fixed energy , only varying the system size . </S>",
    "<S> this has been done before by star  @xcite for @xmath3  fluctuations at two higher energies , and an increase of @xmath11  when going to peripheral collisions was observed . </S>",
    "<S> all three ratios studied by na49 show a similar increase in the magnitude of @xmath11  when going to peripheral collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the hadronic transport model urqmd predicts a similar behaviour here , and the scaling suggested above shows the same dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with the hypothesis that at constant energy the underlying correlations are not significantly changed by a variation of the system size .    , @xmath4  and @xmath5  fluctuations in pb+pb collisions at @xmath15  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the centrality is expressed in terms of @xmath16 , the number of `` wounded '' or participating nucleons.,width=566 ]    in a new analysis  @xcite fluctuations of the kaon to proton ratio were investigated , motivated by their conjectured connection to the baryon - strangeness correlation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figure  [ fig : exc_kpr ] . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the combined charges ratio ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath11  was also evaluated for the @xmath6  ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has the advantage that one source of correlation can be excluded in this channel : no resonance feeds into @xmath17 .    for both ratios , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11  shows a strong dependence on @xmath18 , going from positive values at low energies to @xmath19 at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is not reproduced by the transport models . </S>",
    "<S> hsd and urqmd disagree with regard to the predicted value of @xmath11 , and both models show practically no energy dependence in strong contrast to the data .    </S>",
    "<S> the scaling that successfully described the centrality dependence of all three ratios studied above as well as the energy dependence of @xmath3  and @xmath4  fluctuations fails to work here . </S>",
    "<S> the change of sign observed for @xmath5  and @xmath6  excludes any simple scaling based on average multiplicites . </S>",
    "<S> keeping in mind that such a scaling assumes an invariant correlation strength , this result indicates that the underlying correlation between kaons and protons is changing with energy .    for the @xmath5  and @xmath6  ratios in central pb+pb collisions , compared to calculations in the transport models </S>",
