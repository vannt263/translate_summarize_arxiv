    "the general relativity proposed by einstein predicts the existence of the gravitational waves , which are the distortions of space - time geometry propagating through space as waves .",
    "though it is indirect , there is strong evidence for the existence of the gravitational waves which is provided by the observation of the binary pulsar @xmath4 @xcite . yet up to date no direct detection has been made . in the world , there are lots of ongoing and planned experiments to detect the gravitational waves directly .",
    "laser interferometer gravitational - wave observer  ( ligo )  @xcite is working on the ground in usa . in europe ,",
    "virgo  @xcite commenced operations in 2007 and einstein telescope  ( et )  @xcite is planned . in japan ,",

    "it is also planned to construct the space - borne interferometers such as laser interferometer space antenna  ( lisa )  @xcite ,   deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory  ( decigo )   @xcite , and big bang observer  ( bbo )  @xcite .",
    "the direct detection experiments of the gravitational waves are expected to provide rich information about various astrophysical phenomena , but one of the ultimate goals of the experiments is to probe the early history of the universe . it is presumed that in the very early universe the vacuum energy dominates the universe and causes quasi - exponential expansion of the universe called inflation .",
    "inflation explains the homogeneity and flatness of the universe .",
    "planck satellite  @xcite has measured anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background  ( cmb ) and successfully determined the cosmological parameters with high precision , which supports the prediction of the inflationary theories .",
    "however , it is impossible to prove directly the era before photons decouple from electrons , if we use the result of the observation of cosmic microwave background only . in order to study the early universe before photon decoupling",
    ", we use the gravitational wave since the gravitational wave interacts with other particles very weakly and preserves the information about the early universe .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the gravitational wave production from inflation .",
    "there are several primordial origins of the gravitational waves : quantum fluctuations of the metric  @xcite , preheating   @xcite , domain walls  @xcite , cosmic strings   @xcite , and so on . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the preheating as the origin of gravitational waves . after the end of the inflation ,",
    "the inflaton rapidly oscillates around the true vacuum , interacting with other scalar fields . at this epoch ,",
    "fluctuations of the scalar fields enhanced vastly   @xcite , which produce abundant amount of gravitational waves .",
    "however , in general , the wavelength of the gravitational waves produced from reheating is so short  @xcite that we can not detect the gravitational waves even in the future gravitational wave experiments with high sensitivity . in this work ,",
    "we show that the double inflation model , which was originally proposed in   @xcite to solve the initial value problem for the new inflation , produces gravitational waves with the wavelength long enough to be proved with the planned detectors .    in the double inflation ,",

    "smooth hybrid inflation   @xcite occurs , followed by the second stage at which new inflation occurs . in the intermediate stage ,",
    "the inflaton and waterfall fields oscillate around the minimum of the potential in the same way as the reheating .",
    "since in the smooth hybrid inflation , the gauge symmetry of the waterfall fields is broken even during the inflation , no harmful topological defects are produced . in the previous study  @xcite , it was found that in this model fluctuations of the scalar fields are enhanced by the parametric resonance and then primordial black holes are formed at a characteristic scale . in this paper",
