    "the possibility that irregular distributions of satellite galaxies may be a common feature of large galaxy halos was originally bolstered by several studies of the anisotropic distribution of our own galaxy s satellites .",
    "@xcite found that the magellanic stream along with sculptor and the draco - ursa minor stream and their associated dwarf spheroidal galaxies all appear to lie in the orbital plane of the magellanic clouds . in @xcite ,",
    "all the then known dwarf spheroidal companions of the milky way are identified as lying in one of two streams . @xcite",
    "examined the likelihood of producing the observed disk - like distribution of milky way satellites from a spherical or oblate dark matter halo . from comparisons with theoretical isotropic satellite distributions produced from such a halo , they find that the chance of producing the observed distribution from the dark - matter sub - halos of cold - dark - matter ( cdm ) cosmology is less than 0.5 % .",
    "they examine various combinations of the inner most satellites and find a best - fit plane that is almost perpendicular to the plane of the milky way with a root - mean - square height ranging from only about @xmath3 to @xmath4 kpc .",
    "@xcite , whilst finding a similar plane to @xcite for the milky way satellites , disagree with their assumption that such a plane is unlikely to arise from a conventional cdm dark matter halo .",
    "they argue that that the most luminous satellites can not be taken for granted as forming randomly from the isotropic sub - halo distribution but instead , lie preferentially at smaller distances from the halo centre and co - planar with the major axis of the host halo .",
    "coupled with the finding that galaxies preferentially align themselves with their major - axis highly - inclined or even perpendicular to that of the surrounding matter ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , this would provide a good explanation for the observed orientation of the best fit plane .",
    "the arguments of @xcite are contended by @xcite however , and it should be noted that in contrast to @xcite , @xcite found that the distribution of the most massive subhaloes is not as flattened as the distribution of the milky way s satellites .",
    "more recently , @xcite , using the six halo models in the aquarius simulations @xcite , find that all six halos produce a significant population of sub - halos with quasi - planar orbits aligned with the main halo spin .",
    "this , they argue , is a natural explanation for the observed satellite distribution of the milky way . @xcite",
    "argue against this however . with the calculation of the angular momenta of 8 milky way satellites @xcite revealing a strong alignment between 6 of the orbital poles , @xcite examine the likelihood of randomly drawing 6 sub - halos from each of the 6 aquarius simulations ( among other halo simulations ) , and finding a similar degree of alignment .",
    "more precisely , they draw @xmath5 sets of 8 satellites from each of the 6 simulations , and select the 6 with the highest degree of alignment between their orbits , thus emulating the findings of @xcite .",
    "they then look at the degree of clumping of the orbital poles @xmath6 as well as the angular distance of the average of the orbital pole inclinations from the model equator @xmath7 and find that the actual degree of planarity observed for the six satellites identified by @xcite ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) are equalled or exceeded in the random draws in less than @xmath10 of cases when @xmath6 is considered and less than @xmath11 of cases for @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite also find that the degree of planarity observed for the milky way satellites is uncommon in all six of the aquarius halos ( see fig .",
    "7 of that study ) .",
    "in addition to the revelation that the milky way s satellites appear to inhabit highly - inclined great planes , they also appear to corroborate the finding of @xcite , namely that the companions of spiral galaxies preferentially congregate at high galactic latitudes ( the holmberg effect ) , as observed in his study of 174 galaxy groups .",
    "it is not clear why this should be the case , or even if it truly is the case , although if the apparent adherence of satellite systems to polar great planes is typical of galaxies in general , then the holmberg effect seems to be an extension of this .",
    "@xcite proposed that dynamical friction may be responsible for the observed polar great planes , with those orbits spending the most time in close proximity to the galactic disk , experiencing the fastest decay , while those that take the most direct route through the disk environs , namely the polar orbits , experiencing the slowest orbital decay .",
    "it should be noted however that dynamical friction , whilst producing more polar orbits , would not produce planes of satellites . nor would it be effective on the young globular clusters which are shown to be co - planar with the `` vast plane of satellites '' identified around the milky way by @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite show that dynamical friction did not play a role in the formation of the milky way satellite orbits .    besides the conjecture that satellite great planes trace the major - axis of the dark - matter halo in which the parent galaxy resides , there are other proposed mechanisms for their creation .",
    "one hypothesis is that these planes trace the orbits of ancient galaxies that have been cannibalized by the host galaxy . @xcite",
    "have investigated this hypothesis by looking for planes among groups of satellite galaxies and globular clusters in the milky way s outer halo and find various members to be co - planar with either the magellanic or sagittarius streams .",
    "the findings of @xcite are also consistent with such a hypothesis .",
    "indeed , it is this hypothesis which is most strongly supported by @xcite , wherein the @xmath6 and @xmath7 of satellites drawn from various tidal models equal or exceed @xmath12 and @xmath13 in over @xmath14 of draws in some cases . a similar hypothesis , which in some regards links the galaxy - cannibalization and dark - matter hypotheses , proposes that the observed planes result from the orientation of the large - scale filamentary structure of galaxy clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , an orientation traced out by those minor galaxies which fall into the halo of a major galaxy .",
    "@xcite argue however that extra - galactic associations of dwarf galaxies are too extended to account for the high degree of planarity observed for the milky way satellites .",
    "this argument is supported by the findings of @xcite based on the aquarius simulations .",
    "the great obstacle to a conclusive resolution of these issues is the lack of systems for which reliable spatial ( and kinematic ) data exists .",
    "while some such data does exist for large galaxy clusters such as virgo and coma , accurate 3d distributions of galaxies within their halo have for a long time been known only for our own galaxy s halo , ascertainable due to our central position within it .",
    "it has only been in recent times that a second system has opened up to us - that of our counterpart in the local group , m31 . whilst various databases of photometry and",
    "other data have been available for m31 and some of its brighter companions for over a decade , it is the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas - @xcite ) - a deep photometric , 2-colour survey providing a uniform coverage of the m31 halo out to approximately 150 kpc - that has provided a new level of detail for this system .",
    "it is from this survey that we obtained our distances to m31 and 27 of its companions , following the method developed in @xcite ( henceforth cli11 ) and further adapted for this purpose in @xcite ( henceforth cil12 ) .",
    "the distances themselves and their associated uncertainty distributions are presented in cil12 and it is these distributions that are utilized for all analysis contained in this paper .    with regard to previous studies of the anisotropy in the m31 satellite distribution , two investigations warrant consideration at this point .",
    "@xcite , making use of wide field camera ( wfc ) photometry from the isaac newton telescope ( int ) in what was essentially the forerunner to the pandas survey , focus on  ghostly streams \" of satellite galaxies following a similar approach as @xcite used for the milky way .",
    "in addition , they characterize the large degree of asymmetry in the satellite distribution , a feature also noted in cil12 , and examine the radial distribution of the satellites , noting a ( statistically insignificant ) larger average distance from m31 than that observed between the milky way and its satellites .",
    "they find a large number of candidate satellite streams , with some favoring the dwarf spheroidal members .",
    "utilize distance measurements from a variety of sources and focus particularly on planes of satellites and , whilst they do not find a particularly significant best fit plane when their whole satellite sample is considered , it is rather interesting that they find a 99.7 % statistical significance to their best fit plane when the then - known dwarf spheroidal galaxies dominate their sample .",
    "furthermore , this plane is near - polar - as has been observed for the milky way , although they find little support for the holmberg effect .",
    "@xcite utilize a particularly robust method in their search for high - significance planar fits to subsets of galaxies by considering every possible combination of a given number of satellites from their sample .    in the current study",
    "we employ a similar approach , but with the great advantage of having a considerably extended sample of galaxies in our sample , with all distances derived by the same method and from the same data as described in cli11 and cil12 .",
    "( distances are sampled from the distributions without the density prior applied - e.g. cil12 , table 1 , column 2 - whilst the best fit distances are drawn from cil12 , table 2 , column 4 . ) as a result , we are able to give full consideration to the effects of selection bias on the observed satellite distribution .",
    "this then presents an excellent opportunity to greatly improve our knowledge of the three - dimensional structure of the m31 satellite distribution , with important implications regarding the recent evolution of the system .",
    "a breakdown of the structure of the paper is as follows . in section ",
    "[ s_method ] , we outline our method for plane fitting (  [ ss_method_pf ] ) and locating significant planes of satellites as well as the orientation , magnitude and significance of the asymmetry of the distribution . a method for generating random realizations of satellites subject to the same selection biases as the real data",
    "is also discussed in this section (  [ ss_method_rr ] ) as is the selection bias itself (  [ ss_method_sdb ] ) .",
    " [ s_results ] then presents the results of applying these methods , first to the sample as a whole , and then to subsets of galaxies . specifically ,  [ ss_bfp_all_sats ] presents a study of planarity within the satellite system when all satellites contribute to the determination of the best fit plane ;  [ ss_asy_all_sats ] examines the asymmetry in a similar way ;  [ sat_subsets ] examines the orientations of planes of smaller subsets of satellites within the distribution ; and  [ great_plane ] concludes this section with a determination of the significance of a ` great plane ' of satellites emerging from the preceding sections .",
    "sections [ s_discussion ] and [ s_conclusions ] then follow with discussion and conclusions .",
    "note that this paper was written in conjunction with a shorter contribution ( @xcite ; hereafter ilc13 ) which announced some of the key discoveries resulting from the analysis we present here .",
    "in particular , the process of identifying the member satellites of the ` great plane ' discussed in ilc13 is described here in more detail . in this analysis however , we concern ourselves with the _ spatial _ structure of the satellite system only and so the reader should refer to ilc13 for the interesting insight provided by the addition of the velocity information .",
    "in order to find planes of satellites within the m31 satellite system , our first concern is to convert the satellite distances as presented in cil12 into three - dimensional positions . to do this , we begin with an m31-centered , cartesian coordinate system oriented such that the x and y axes lie in the m31 tangent plane with the z - axis pointed toward the earth .",
    "specifically , the x - axis corresponds to @xmath15 which is the projection of m31 s declination onto the tangent plane .",
    "the y - axis then corresponds to @xmath16 - the projection of m31 s right ascension onto the tangent plane .",
    "the z - axis then points along the earth - to - m31 vector , with magnitude increasing with distance from earth .",
    "this orientation can be seen in fig .",
    "10(c ) of cil12 .",
    "thus :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the distances from earth to m31 and from earth to the satellite respectively , @xmath20 is the angular separation on the sky between m31 and the satellite , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the real - angle equivalents of the tangent plane projection angles @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "next , we rotate this reference frame to the conventional m31 reference frame such that the positive z - axis points toward m31 s north galactic pole(i.e .",
    "@xmath25 ) and the @xmath26 meridian passes through the earth .",
    "so as to be consistent with the earlier work of @xcite , we have adopted the same values for m31 s position angle ( @xmath27 ) and inclination ( @xmath28 - @xcite ) .",
    "each object is hence rotated by @xmath27 about the z - axis to counter the effect of its position angle , and then @xmath28 about the x - axis to account for m31 s inclination .",
    "a final rotation of @xmath29 about the z - axis is then necessary to bring @xmath26 into alignment with the direction of earth ( which hence lies at @xmath30 ) .",
    "the resulting spherical coordinates for each object in the sample are plotted onto an aitoff - hammer projection in fig .",
    "[ sat_aitoff ] .",
    "this same figure also shows the uncertainties in position associated with each object , generated via sampling of the respective distance posterior probability distributions ( ppds ) of each object and subsequent conversion of each drawn distance into a three - dimensional position .    with the satellites positions determined in cartesian coordinates , it is straight forward to determine the minimum distance of each satellite from a given plane as follows :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the distance of a satellite at a point @xmath33 from a plane whose normal vector is @xmath34 and is of unit length . for simplicity ,",
    "we invoke the reasonable requirement that all planes must pass through the center of m31 and so in our case , @xmath35 and the plane normal vector points out from the center of m31 . hence , in order to find the best - fit or maximum significance plane to a set of satellites , we need simply minimize @xmath32 for the satellites to be fitted .",
    "this can be done via a variety of means , some of which are compared in the following section , but perhaps the most robust and the predominant method employed in this study , is that of minimizing the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the distances to the fitted satellites .    in order to measure the asymmetry of the satellite distribution about a given plane ,",
    "we need only count the number of satellites on one side of the plane . to do this ,",
    "we can simply remove the absolute value signs from equation [ e_plane_dist ] , so that the side of the plane on which a satellite lies can be determined by whether @xmath32 is positive or negative .",
    "the plane of maximum asymmetry is then taken to be that which divides the sample such that the difference in satellite counts for opposite sides of the plane is greatest .",
    "whether we wish to determine the best fit plane through a sample of satellites or the plane of maximum asymmetry , we require a system by which a large number of planes can be tested on the sample so that the goodness of fit ( or asymmetry ) can be calculated for each . to do this",
    ", we define each tested plane by its normal vector or pole @xmath34 so that eq .",
    "[ e_plane_dist ] can be applied directly .",
    "we then rotate this pole to different orientations around the sky in such a way as to ` scan ' the whole sphere evenly and at a suitably high resolution . in practice , we need to be able to apply this routine many thousands of times for a large number of samples and so a fast computational time is of the essence . to this end , for a given sample , our algorithm determines the desired plane following a two step procedure .",
    "firstly , a low resolution scan of the sphere is made to determine the approximate direction on the sky of the pole to the best - fit plane . only half the sphere actually needs to be scanned since poles lying on the opposite hemisphere correspond to the identical planes flipped upside down .",
    "the low resolution scan tests 2233 different poles across the hemisphere .",
    "a near - uniform coverage is achieved by decreasing the number of planes tested in proportion to the cosine of the latitude of the planes pole .",
    "this prohibits what would otherwise be an increased coverage at the higher latitudes of the coordinate system . with the pole to the best - fit plane determined in low - resolution , a high resolution search",
    "is then made around the identified coordinates at 10 times the resolution . in this way a pole",
    "can effectively be found at any of approximately 250,000 evenly spread locations on the hemisphere .      whilst we are now equipped to identify best - fit planes to our sample and subsamples thereof ,",
    "it is necessary to have some means of determining the significance of these planes in an absolute sense . the most intuitive way to do",
    "this is to perform the same analysis on a randomly generated sample of equal size .",
    "in particular , when we are concerned with all possible combinations of a particular number of satellites that can be produced from the whole sample , we are often dealing with a very large number of subsamples and so it is inevitable that some of these subsets of satellites will exhibit a very high degree of planarity .",
    "identical analysis must therefore be performed on random distributions , to see if there are similar numbers of subsets with equal degrees of planarity .",
    "for this reason , considerable care was taken to design an algorithm capable of providing a unique random realization of the desired number of satellites whenever it is called .",
    "the algorithm makes use of the distance ppd for each satellite , and also takes into account the irregular window function ( i.e. useable portion ) of the pandas survey . each time a satellite is to be added to the random realization ,",
    "one of the 27 actual satellites is chosen at random and a distance is drawn from its associated ppd .",
    "this distance ( @xmath19 ) is then converted into a three dimensional position @xmath33 following equation set [ e_cart_coord ] and this satellite - to - m31 separation vector is then spun around to a new , random location in the m31 sky .",
    "note that for each random realization , a new value of @xmath18 is similarly drawn from the m31 distance ppd .",
    "once again , care must be taken in this step to ensure that the whole sphere is given equal weight , otherwise there is a higher likelihood for the artificial satellites to be positioned at high latitude .",
    "again , this is remedied by weighting the likelihood by the cosine of the latitude .",
    "with the new , random location for the satellite chosen , it is then projected back onto the sky as it would appear from earth and a check is made to ensure that it does indeed lie within the boundaries of the pandas survey area , and outside of the central ellipse ( @xmath36 major axis , @xmath37 minor axis - see fig .",
    "10 ( c ) of cil12 ) where the disk of m31 inhibits reliable measurements .",
    "if the satellite does not meet these requirements , it is rejected and the satellite drawing process is repeated until a suitable position is generated . by repeating this process until the desired number of satellites are produced , a new , random comparison sample is generated which gives full account to the constraints on the actual data .    in order for the random satellite realizations to mimic the actual data most closely , it is necessary that each artificial satellite is represented not by just one point , but rather a string of points reflecting the uncertainty in the earth - to - object distance .",
    "hence once acceptable positions for each satellite are drawn as described above , the distance distributions for each object are sampled and projected to their equivalent positions along the line of sight about the initially placed point . for sections [ ss_bfp_all_sats ] , [ ss_asy_all_sats ] and [ great_plane ] each artificial satellite s distance distribution",
    "is represented by @xmath38 points such that each plane - fitting measurement is made for @xmath38 possible positions of the object and then the average value of the measurements is taken .",
    "the only exception to this number is where the maximum - likelihood approach is used in  [ ss_bfp_all_sats ] . due to the inclusion of a second fitting parameter in this case , only @xmath39 samples are taken for each satellite . for  [ sat_subsets",
    "] , as we are not concerned with comparisons of plane significance between the real sample and the random realizations , it is sufficient to use a single drawn position for each artificial satellite .      by employing a similar method to",
    "that described above , it is also possible to explore the effect of the pandas survey area boundaries on the satellite detection bias as viewed from the center of m31 .",
    "it is intuitive that more satellites are likely to be detected along the line of sight to earth , since even satellites at a large distance from m31 will still appear within the survey boundaries if they lie along this line .",
    "we can visualize this effect by generating a large number of randomly distributed satellites and plotting them on the m31 sky after first rejecting those satellites that would appear outside the survey area ` mask ' if viewed from earth . to do this ,",
    "one million satellites were drawn from a spherically symmetric halo potential with density falling off as a function of the square of the distance from the halo center .",
    "satellites were hence drawn at distances between @xmath40 and @xmath41 kpc from m31 with equal probability .",
    "the satellites were then projected onto the m31 tangent plane and those satellites lying outside the survey area or inside the m31 disk obstruction area were excised from the density map .",
    "the resulting anisotropy of the satellites on the m31 sky is presented in fig .",
    "[ survey_mask_effects ] .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the probability of detection is indeed higher along a great circle oriented edge - on with respect to the direction of earth , and perpendicular to the m31 disk ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this great circle has its pole/ anti - pole at @xmath43 and hence we would expect a predisposition toward finding planes of satellites with a pole in this vicinity .",
    "we would also expect , though to a lesser extent , to find an excess of satellite planes oriented edge - on with respect to earth at any inclination .",
    "such planes would have poles lying anywhere on the great circle whose normal is directed toward earth .",
    "the drop in the satellite density at @xmath30 and @xmath44 is a consequence of the hinderance to detection caused by the m31 disk . due to the increased volume of space covered by the survey at greater distances from earth , unhindered satellite detection is possible over a larger range of angles on the far side of m31 in comparison to the earth - ward side .",
    "in order to find the best - fit plane to the satellite system as a whole , the procedure of  [ ss_method_pf ] is applied to the whole sample of 27 satellites presented in cil12 .",
    "the rms thickness of the sample is used here , as in subsequent sections , as the statistic of planarity ; we find it to be a robust measure and it has the convenient property of being computationally inexpensive .",
    "since we are dealing with only one sample in this case , two other measures are also used for comparison .",
    "the first calculates the sum of the absolute values of the distances of each of the satellites from the tested plane .",
    "the second is essentially a maximum likelihood approach and replaces the plane of zero - thickness with a ` gaussian plane ' such that a satellite s position within the gaussian determines the plane s goodness - of - fit to that satellite .",
    "this second approach requires that different gaussian widths @xmath45 be tested for each plane orientation in order to find the width that best matches the satellite distribution .",
    "values between 5kpc and 150 kpc were tested at 5 kpc intervals for each tested plane orientation .",
    "hence an additional characteristic of the satellite distribution is obtained , but at the expense of a considerably longer computation time .    for each of the three measures of goodness - of - fit described above , the first step is to find the best - fit plane to the satellite positions with their positions determined from their best - fit distances .",
    "when either the rms or maximum likelihood approach is used , the same best - fit plane is found as @xmath46 with pole at @xmath47 .",
    "this plane is plotted as a great circle on the m31 sky in fig .",
    "[ bfp_all_sats ] with the poles of the plane indicated .",
    "when the absolute distance sum is used instead , the pole is found farther from the plane of the galaxy , at @xmath48 .",
    "nevertheless , the polar - plane described by @xcite is supported by either measurement , and is reminiscent of the satellite streams identified in the milky way satellite system . in light of the detection biases imposed by the pandas survey area as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ survey_mask_effects ] , the result in this case must clearly be treated with suitable caution however .",
    "like @xcite , we find little evidence for the holmberg effect , with only 3 best - fit satellite positions falling within @xmath49 of the m31 galactic poles , and only 6 of the @xmath50 error trails from fig .",
    "[ sat_aitoff ] pass beyond @xmath51 .    to determine the uncertainty in the plane s goodness - of - fit",
    ", we need to repeat the procedure for a large number of realizations of the satellite sample , with the best - fit satellite distances replaced with a distance drawn at random from their respective satellite distance ppds .",
    "a density map of the best - fit plane poles identified from 200,000 such realizations is presented in fig .",
    "[ rms_distribution ] .",
    "this figure was generated using the distribution rms as the goodness - of - fit statistic , and contains @xmath52 of all poles within a @xmath53 radius of the best - fit pole stated above . when the sum of absolute distances is used in place of the rms",
    ", this fraction falls to @xmath54 , or to @xmath55 when the maximum likelihood approach is used .",
    "it should be noted that the distribution of poles lies in close proximity to the pole of maximum detection bias at @xmath56 , again suggesting that the detection bias is having a strong influence on the polar orientation of the best - fit plane .    in order to determine whether the goodness - of - fit of the best - fit plane is really physically significant , similar analysis should be performed on a large number of random realizations of satellites , to see",

    "for this reason , we now concentrate our analysis on subsets or _ combinations _ of satellites .",
    "specifically , we perform a pole - count analysis by determining the pole of the best - fit plane to every possible satellite combination of a particular size that can be drawn from the entire sample .",
    "a pole - count analysis is an excellent way of mapping the degree of prominence of various planes that exist within the distribution as a whole , whatever their orientation may be .",

    "it is clear from this equation however that with @xmath92 satellites forming the entire sample , the total number of combinations that can be drawn may be very large , depending on the number of satellites forming the combinations .",

    "we note however , that the final pole - plot distribution showing the poles of the best - fit planes to each combination , is not so dependent on the combination size as might at first be thought .    with all the planes tested as per  [ ss_method_pf ] having to pass through the center of m31 , the minimum number of satellites that can not be fitted exactly is @xmath96 .",

    "but it is critical to note that even if we produce our pole - plot map from combinations of only @xmath96 satellites we _ do not _ exclusively find planes consisting of @xmath96 satellites .",
    "if a plane of @xmath98 satellites exists for instance , then by eq .",
    "[ combinations ] , such a plane will produce @xmath100 poles at the same location on the pole plot , where a plane consisting of only @xmath96 satellites would contribute only one pole .",
    "conversely if we take combinations of @xmath98 satellites , despite the larger number of possible combinations in total , we become less sensitive to planes made up of less than @xmath98 satellites .",
    "so in a sense , the combination size we choose depends on the satellite planes we wish to be most sensitive to . in practice",

    "[ sat_aitoff ] .",
    "the larger combination sizes of @xmath101 , @xmath68 and @xmath98 satellites gradually shift toward finding planes closer to the best - fit plane to the entire satellite sample illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bfp_all_sats ] .    noting these points , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , the number of satellites per combination @xmath89 is chosen ( @xmath102 ) and then for each combination , distances are drawn for each of the satellites from their respective posterior distance distributions as provided in cil12 . to give a satisfactory representation of the form of the distributions , each combination",

    ", each satellite combination contributes not @xmath103 pole to the pole density map for the chosen combination size but @xmath39 , with the spread of poles relating the possible orientations of the best - fit plane to the combination , given the error in the individual satellite positions .",
    "the contribution of each pole to the density map is also weighted by dividing it by the rms of the best - fit plane it represents .",
    "thus each pole does not contribute @xmath103 count , but rather some fraction , depending on how good a fit the plane it represents is to the satellites in the combination .",

    ", it should also be noted that we effectively limit the total number of satellites in our sample to @xmath92 for all analysis in this subsection .",
    "this is to account for the bound group of satellites consisting of ngc147 , ngc185 and and xxx ( henceforth the ngc147 group - see @xcite ) . since we suspect that these satellites orbit m31 as a group and since they all lie along the apparent plane identified in fig .",
    "[ sat_aitoff ] , it is preferable to treat the group as a single object when we are not concerned with measurements of the significance of particular planes . to do this , we take the luminosity weighted centre as an approximation for the center of mass , and treat this determined position as though it were the location of a single satellite . to calculate the luminosity weighted center",
    ", we can ignore the contribution from and xxx since it is negligible compared with the contributions of the two dwarf ellipticals . from the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies @xcite , ngc185 is @xmath104 magnitudes brighter than ngc147 in the v - band .",
    "each time the ngc147 group is chosen as one of the ` satellites ' for a combination , distances to each of ngc147 and ngc185 are sampled from their respective distributions and the luminosity weighted center of the group is determined .",
    "as for any other combination , this position , along with all other satellites in the combination , is sampled @xmath39 times .",

    "the other , lower latitude principle maximum in the pole plots is that corresponding approximately to the best fit to _ all _ the satellites and hence it grows more prominent in the plots made from larger combination sizes as discussed earlier .    besides the pole count maxima that are strongly indicative of a highly planar subset of satellites , the other principle feature of the pole plots in fig .",
    "[ actual_pole_plots ] is the great circle along which the pole count density is highest .",

    "this is a particularly interesting possibility , especially since the plane , when projected onto the m31 tangent plane , is in close alignment with the giant stellar stream . indeed , @xcite show that the giant stellar stream could feasibly be the product of a major merger event that began around @xmath128 gyr ago , sustained by the returning stars from a tidal tail oriented similarly to our ` great plane . '",
    "if a link is to be established , the observed asymmetry of the system must also be compatible with the tidal scenario however .",
    "it is of particular interest that , of the @xmath133 co - rotating satellites in the plane , all but one lie on the near side of the m31 tangent plane . indeed ,",
    "if we removed all of the plane member - satellites from the system , the remaining satellite distribution would no longer be significantly asymmetric . with almost all of the satellites currently on the near side of m31",
    ", it would seem on first consideration that the progenitor event could not have occurred substantially more than a typical orbital time ago or else the satellites would have had sufficient time to disperse .",
    "this suggests the event responsible must have occurred within the last @xmath101 gyr .",
    "other studies however have supported the proposition that a group of tidal dwarf galaxies could survive for extended periods whilst retaining the asymmetry inherent from the time of their formation .",
    "for instance , @xcite find three moderately old tidal dwarf candidates with this asymmetry preserved .",
    "it must also be remembered that the precise orbits of the satellites are undetermined and so it is not clear how close they have come to m31 in the past . as discussed by @xcite , there is also evidence that tidal material can survive in a bridge between the interacting galaxies for an extended period .",
    "nevertheless , it must be cautioned that there is no established precedent for tidal dwarfs with the longevity implied by the stellar populations of the m31 satellites , and the fact that they continue to adhere to such a thin structure is even more perplexing under such a scenario .",
    "there is also another striking characteristic of the observed plane . as one will note from examination of fig .",
    "[ best_15_aitoff ] ( and indeed the left - hand column of plots in fig .",
    "[ actual_pole_plots ] ) , it is oriented perfectly edge - on with respect to the milky way . whilst there is a noted bias toward detection of satellites positioned along planes oriented in this way",
    ", it must be remembered that this bias arises primarily due to the propensity for detecting satellites close to the line of sight passing through m31 .",
    "many of the satellites observed to lie on our plane are located a good distance from this line of sight however and well into the low - bias portions of the m31 sky . in any case , the random realizations of  [ great_plane ] suffer from the same biases and yet show unequivocally that the observed plane is very unlikely to arise by chance .",
    "hence if we are to accept these results , we must also accept the plane s orientation .",
    "further to this strikingly edge - on orientation , it is also noteworthy that the plane is approximately perpendicular to the milky way disk",
    ". this fact can be easily seen if the constituent satellites are traced out in galactic coordinates ( i.e. all lie on approximately the same galactic longitude ) .",
    "this of course raises the question - how does the orientation of the milky way s polar plane of satellites compare with this plane ? noting that the average pole of the ` vast polar structure ' described by @xcite points roughly in the direction of m31 , the two planes are approximately orthogonal .",
    "these precise alignments are discussed in more detail in ilc13 , but suffice to say here that this alignment is particularly interesting and suggests that the milky way and m31 halos should not necessarily be viewed as fully isolated structures .",
    "it is entirely conceivable that our current ignorance as to the coupling between such structures may be to blame for our inability to pin down the precise mechanism by which such planes arise .",
    "finally , in consequence of these findings , most particularly with respect to the highly significant , very thin disk of satellites that has been identified , it is clear that if @xmath134 is to remain the standard model of cosmology , the occurrence of such structures has to be explicable within it .",
    "the possible deeper implications of the satellite anisotropies are discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite wherein other alternative cosmologies are also highlighted .",
    "it is clear that whilst the satellites of m31 when taken as a whole are no more planar than one can expect from a random distribution , a subset consisting of roughly half the sample _ is _ remarkably planar .",
    "the presence of this thin disk of satellites has been conspicuous throughout the analysis contained in this paper .",
    "the degree of asymmetry determined from the satellite distribution is also found to be relatively high .",
    "of particular note , the orientation of the asymmetry is very significant , being aligned very strongly in the direction of the milky way . when this fact is combined with the apparent orthogonality observed between the milky way and m31 satellite distributions and the milky way disk",
    ", it appears that the two halos may in fact be coupled .",
    "regardless , the great plane of satellites identified in this study , and its clear degree of significance , is not directly expected from @xmath134 cosmology .",
    "this finding provides strong evidence that thin disks of satellites do indeed exist in galaxy halos , and whether or not the standard model can account for such structures remains to be seen .",
