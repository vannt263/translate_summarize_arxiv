    "research in qws started with the coined discrete - time qw  @xcite proposed with the goal of displaying a quantum system with features strikingly different from classical systems . from a different viewpoint ,",
    "meyer  @xcite proposed a non - trivial example of a quantum cellular automata which can be somehow considered the starting point of staggered qws . by quantizing continuous classical markov chains , farhi and gutmann  @xcite proposed a continuous - time version of qws , with clear implications to the area of quantum computing .",
    "inspired by classical discrete markov chains , szegedy  @xcite proposed a coinless discrete - time qw model and was able to provide us with a natural definition of quantum hitting time .",
    "szegedy s qws are obtained by quantizing classical discrete markov chains described by some transition matrix .",
    "szegedy  @xcite also developed qw - based search algorithms inspired by a previous known coined - based search algorithm  @xcite .",
    "on ergodic markov chains , it is possible to detect the presence of a marked vertex at a hitting time that is quadratically smaller than the classical average hitting time  @xcite .",
    "szegedy s model was also used for the searching problem  @xcite , which aims to find the location of a marked vertex , and for searching triangles  @xcite .",
    "some references highlighted the power of the method , for instance see ref .",
    "the fact that szegedy s model is a qw on the edges of a bipartite graph rather than on the vertices is emphasized in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate this idea by employing the line graph of the bipartite graph .",
    "meyer  @xcite circumvented the triviality of quantum cellular automata by relaxing the homogeneity condition .",
    "he proposed an one - dimensional quantum cellular automata driven by staggered unitary operators , which can be transposed as a coinless qw on the line or cycle .",
    "the connection of this model with the staggered lattice fermion formalism was analyzed in  @xcite for the two - dimensional case and applied for spatial searching in  @xcite .",
    "the staggered model was rediscovered by falk  @xcite , who suggested a simple method of obtaining the evolution operator by splitting the vertices of the graph into disjoint polygons that tessellate the two - dimensional lattice .",
    "falk also proposed a searching method , which was used by  @xcite to prove analytically that the staggered model finds a marked vertex in time @xmath0 for a two - dimensional lattice with @xmath1 vertices matching the performance achieved by other forms of qws on this graph .",
    "the detailed dynamics of the one - dimensional staggered model was analyzed in  @xcite and the moments of the probability distribution function in  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the coined and the staggered one - dimensional qws was analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "further analysis on this connection is an important research topic .    in this paper",
    "we formally define the staggered qw model on graphs by using tessellations so that each tessellation covers all vertices with non - overlapping polygons and the tessellation union covers all edges .",
    "the maximal cliques play an essential role in building the tessellation because adjacent vertices are reachable for the walker s hopping .",
    "if two or more maximal cliques share a common vertex , each clique must be inside a different tessellation .",
    "the evolution operator is a product of orthogonal reflections that have a one - to - one correspondence with the tessellations producing a diffusion through the maximal cliques in a staggered way .",
    "after the action of the evolution operator with a localized initial condition , the wave function spreads to all vertices reachable by the graph structure , which is the clique with the starting location and the adjacent maximal cliques for the case with two reflections .",
    "we also discuss a generalized form of staggered qw using partial tessellations which can be used for spatial search algorithms in the sense that the walker will search for the vertices inside the missing polygons .",
    "the complete dynamics is obtained by applying the evolution operator recursively starting with some initial state and by performing a measurement at the end .",
    "after formally defining the staggered model , we show that szegedy s qws on a bipartite graph @xmath2 are staggered qws on the line graph of @xmath2 with a restricted form of tessellation .",
    "the restriction is : the polygons must share only one vertex .",
    "the converse is also true .",
    "any staggered qw with tessellations that share one vertex in the polygon intersections can be cast into an extended version of szegedy s model with complex amplitudes .",
    "this result sheds light on the structure of szegedy s model and explains the meaning of the fact that a szegedy s qw is a hopping on the edges of the bipartite graph rather than on the vertices .",
    "we also show that there are generalized staggered qws that reproduce the searching model proposed by szegedy . in this case",
    "we need to use partial tessellations and the walker looks for vertices inside missing polygons , which are the ones returned by the measurement . on the other hand ,",
    "if we allow two or more vertices in at least one polygon intersection , we define instances of staggered qws that can not be cast into szegedy s framework .",
    "we give special attention to those instances .",
    "falk  @xcite proposed an evolution operator for a searching model on the two - dimensional lattice by interlacing a reflection around the marked vertices with the orthogonal reflections generated by the tessellations .",
    "we use this searching model to define the hitting time on staggered qws on finite graphs by generalizing szegedy s definition and we describe how to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the evolution operator using the discriminant matrix generated by the inner product of the polygons of the tessellations .",
    "we show that the evolution operator with marked vertices can be written as a product of two orthogonal reflections , and if an entire polygon is marked , the walker is not able to find it .",

    "each tessellation uses non - overlapping ( non - planar ) polygons of adjacent vertices which need not to have the same shape and a polygon may contain only one vertex .",
    "the set of polygons of each tessellation need to cover all vertices of the graph and the tessellation union must cover all edges .",
    "two polygons in different tessellations necessarily overlap and some ( or all ) intersections may contain more than one vertex . each polygon defines a unit vector in the hilbert space @xmath3 by superposing the vertices in the polygon with nonzero amplitudes .",

    "let us define the notion of _ orthogonal reflection _ of a graph .",
    "a unitary and hermitian operator @xmath27 is called an orthogonal reflection of a graph if the eigenvectors of @xmath27 associated with eigenvalue 1 have non - overlapping nonzero entries and the sum of those eigenvectors has no zero entries in the orthonormal basis associated to the vertices of the graph .",
    "this definition is basis independent because a basis change keeps the orthogonal reflection invariant and changes the orthonormal basis associated to the graph .",
    "a staggered qw on a graph @xmath2 can be alternatively defined by a unitary evolution operator that is a product of orthogonal reflections of @xmath2 that covers the edges of the graph .",
    "given an orthogonal reflection in the basis of @xmath28 associated with the vertices of @xmath2 , it is possible to build a disconnected @xmath1-graph as a disjoint union of cliques , where each clique is associated to an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 and the clique is formed with the vertices that have nonzero amplitudes .",
    "each clique defines a polygon and the set of polygons is the tessellation associated with this orthogonal reflection .",
    "the product of orthogonal reflections defines the final graph after the union ( and merging ) of the edges of all cliques .",
    "this final graph must be equal to @xmath2 .",
    "the union of the tessellations does not have disposable edges in the sense that every edge is inside a polygon of some tessellation .",
    "it is tempting to remove the requirement that the polygons must be cliques .",
    "the removal of this requirement is troublesome because after one application of the unitary operator @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) with non - clique polygons , the walker can go to non - adjacent vertices . in quantum walk models",
    ", we expect that the walker only hops to adjacent vertices , and successive applications of shift operators move the walker to distant locations .",

    "the marked vertices are the ones in the missing polygons .",
    "( 2 ) searching _  la _",
    "falk uses the standard tessellation procedure but interlaces the orthogonal reflections with a reflection around the marked vertices . in both cases we can use szegedy s spectral theorem to calculate the spectrum of the evolution operator when using two tessellations .",
    "we have also defined the quantum hitting time on staggered qws using reflections around the marked vertices which generalizes szegedy s original definition .",
    "we have shown that the evolution operator , originally defined as a product of four reflections , can be written as a product of two reflections .    because all vertices of the two - dimensional lattice belong to the intersection of four maximum cliques , it is necessary to employ at least four tessellations .",
    "the case with exactly four tessellations has one vertex in the polygon intersections but can not be cast into szegedy s framework because it employs more than two tessellations .",
