    "in the paper @xcite we can find a lemma without complete ( and exact ) proof ( see lemma in @xcite ) was very important in the solving of the problem ; find the optimal ball packing with respect to the crystallographic group @xmath2 .",
    "( we use the standard notation of a crystallographic group , it can be found e.g. in the international tables @xcite . ) in this paper we give a short and elegant proof for this basic statement , namely we shall prove that :    if a brick has a unit volume , its side lengths are not less than @xmath0 and the vertices of a triangle lie on the skew edges of this brick , then there is a side of the triangle whose length is not greater than @xmath1 .",
    "this geometric problem can be handing by the standard analytic methods badly , we have to investigate certain complete polynomial equations of order six or of order higher than six .",
    "so without further geometric simplification there is no chance to solve it exactly .",
    "the geometric intuition helps us to reduce the number and order of the variables thus it is very important in the solution of such a problem .",
    "similar elementary but hard results can be found in the papers @xcite and @xcite also showing that the intuition can not be change to a mechanical ( theoretical or analytical ) computation in every time and every cases .",
    "the following simple lemma plays an important role in the proof of the required result",
    ".     +    let @xmath3 and @xmath4 three fixed point of the plane does not lying on a line and assume that the angle @xmath5 is not obtuse . then from among the rectangles which one vertex is @xmath6 and an edge of it opposite to @xmath6 and has minimal area one of its edges either @xmath7 or @xmath8 .    on fig .",
    "1 we can see the possible rectangles with possible minimal areas . from this lemma",
    "first we shall prove the following statement :    if a brick has a unit volume , its side lengths are not less than @xmath0 and the vertices of a regular triangle lie on the skew edges of this brick , then the length of its sides is not greater than @xmath1 .",
    "finally we observe that statement 1 already is a simple consequence of statement 2 .",
    "we note that the condition on the lengthes of the edges of the brick may not omit , in a sufficiently thin brick with volume 1 we can put whatever large regular triangle .",
    "* proof : * [ lemma 1 ] first we note that booth of the mentioned rectangles are exists because of the initial assumptions .",
    "the notation of figure 1 we now have @xmath9 and @xmath10 thus the examined area is @xmath11 @xmath12 is minimal if @xmath13 is minimal on the parameter domain defined by the inequalities @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the computation @xmath16\\geq\\ ] ] @xmath17 shows that it would be minimal in cases @xmath18 or @xmath19 this proves the lemma .",
    "this implies the following equalities : @xmath21 and @xmath22 thus a short computation shows that @xmath23.\\ ] ] with respect to the various @xmath24 we can see immediately that of the function @xmath25\\ ] ] there is precisely one minima on the half line @xmath26 $ ] in an inner point of the interval @xmath27 $ ] . on the other hand if @xmath28 ( and by assumption @xmath29 ) then @xmath30 implying that @xmath31 which is a contradiction .",
    "so we can assume that @xmath32 $ ] and thus we have to take the maximum of @xmath33 on this closed interval .",
    "they are attained on the boundary points of @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "hence we get that in this case @xmath34 and the optimum given by two configuration which are equivalent to each other .",
    "the parameter values : @xmath35 and @xmath36    we now investigate * the second case * , we assume that there is no edge of the triangle which is also an edge of the brick .",
    "first we note that an triangle which can pack ( satisfying the conditions of the arrangement ) in a brick with less volume then 1 can not be maximal one . consider that edge of the brick which contains the vertex @xmath6 ( see on fig .",
    "project orthogonally the arrangement onto one of the face of the brick orthogonal to this edge .",
    "observe that the image of the regular triangle is a triangle with vertices @xmath37 which is drawing in a rectangle on the manner described in lemma 1 .",
    "if the edges @xmath38 and @xmath39 are not edges of the rectangle , then ( by lemma 1 ) there is a rectangle with smaller area and the brick building up this base with the original height also contains the original regular triangle on its skew edges .",
    "this means that the triangle is not maximal .",
    "this can be saying too in the case of the vertices @xmath40 and @xmath4 and thus we get that one of the edges of the triangle is an diagonal of a face of the brick .",
    "( see fig .",
    "3 )      by the notation of fig.2 our problem analytically now simplified the following one : minimalize the function : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and thus @xmath43 and hence @xmath44 from this we get that @xmath45\\ ] ] and @xmath23.\\ ] ] we can follow now the argument of the first case as we also get that @xmath34 .",
    "we now have two new optimal arrangements with the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "all of the optimal cases can be seen on fig . 4 and the statement is proved .            * in the first case * we have two possibilities because @xmath6 and @xmath40 are respective vertices of the cube .",
    "in fact , if @xmath6 is not a vertex then the strict inequalities @xmath51 implies that the minimal edge of the triangle can be increased and it is not optimal triangle .",
    "so we have two cases    * the edge @xmath7 is an edge of the brick .",
    "the value @xmath52 is maximal if @xmath4 is the midpoint of the opposite edge .",
    "but if @xmath53 then @xmath54 showing that @xmath55 or @xmath56 less than @xmath57 .",
    "this is a contradiction . *",
    "the edge @xmath7 is a diagonal of the brick . at this time @xmath52",
    "has maximal value if @xmath4 is the point of intersection of the bisector of the segment @xmath7 and an edge of the face opposite to the face containing the diagonal @xmath7 .",
    "now we have @xmath58 contradicting statement 2 .",
    "in fact the affinity orthogonal to the face of @xmath7 with ratio less than 1 gives a regular triangle of edge length @xmath1 in a brick of volume less than 1 .",
    "this is a contradiction again .      * in the second case * we assume that @xmath59",
    ". if @xmath60 and one of the vertices @xmath6 and @xmath4 is not a vertex of the brick then a little move of it can imply one of the inequalities @xmath61 or @xmath62 and thus the condition of the first case is holding .",
    "thus we can assume that @xmath6 and @xmath4 are vertices of the brick and can apply the argument of the first case .",
    "so the only possibility to get an optimal arrangement if we assume that @xmath63 and we get back the statement of statement 2 ."
