    "in recent years , the coordination of multi - agent systems has attracted lots of attention by the systems and control community due to its wide applications . for the coordination of multi - agent systems with digital networks ,",
    "the inter - agent communication , which aims at obtaining neighbors state information as precise as possible , is usually the foundation of designing the cooperative control laws . in real digital networks ,",
    "communication channels only have finite capacities and the communication between different agents is a process which consists of encoding , information transmitting and decoding . for this case , the instantaneously precise communication is generally impossible and one may seek encoding - decoding schemes to achieve asymptotically precise communication .    the most basic coordination of multi - agent systems is distributed consensus or synchronization , which is also called cooperative stabilization @xcite .",
    "quantized consensus and consensus with quantized communication can be dated back to @xcite and @xcite with the static quantization .",
    "_ @xcite proposed a dynamic encoding - decoding scheme for distributed averaging .",
    "they proved that with infinite - level logarithmic quantization , the closed - loop system can achieve exact average - consensus asymptotically .",
    "li _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite proposed a dynamic encoding - decoding scheme with vanishing scaling function and finite - level uniform quantizers .",
    "they proved that the exact average - consensus can be achieved exponentially fast based on merely one - bit information exchange per communication between neighbors .",
    "this algorithm was then further generalized to the cases with directed and time - varying topologies ( @xcite-@xcite ) , the case with time delays ( @xcite ) , the case with general linear agent dynamics with full measurable states ( @xcite ) and the case with second - order integrator dynamics with partially measurable states ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent works in this direction can be found in @xcite for ternary information exchange , the continuous - time dynamics ( @xcite ) and consensus over finite fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "all the above literature ( @xcite-@xcite ) focused on designing specific communication and control protocols and analyzing the closed - loop performances for specific systems .",
    "however , a fundamental problem of the coordination of multi - agent systems over digital networks is for what kinds of dynamic networks , there exist proper communication and control protocols which can guarantee the objectives of the inter - agent communication and cooperative control jointly .",
    "the coordination of digital multi - agent networks consists of two fundamental factors , one is the inter - agent state observation by communication among agents , and the other one is the cooperative control by each agent to achieve given coordination objectives .",
    "the inter - agent state observation is the objective of the inter - agent communication and is the basis of designing the cooperative control laws .",
    "this is similar in spirit to that the state observation is the basis of the feedback control design for single - agent systems with unmeasurable states .",
    "it is of theoretical and practical significance to characterize the inter - agent state observation and the cooperative control of multi - agent systems in an integrative framework . in this framework",
    ", one needs to first give the conditions for the existence of communication and control protocols to ensure both the communication and control objectives . for the case with precise communication ,",
    "the consentability of linear multi - agent systems were studied .",
    "the concept of consentability was first proposed by @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the controllability of agent dynamics and the connectivity of the communication topology graph have a joint influence on the consentability .",

    ", we consider the cooperatability of linear discrete - time multi - agent systems with unmeasurable states and finite communication data rate .",
    "we propose a class of communication protocols based on quantized - observer type encoders and decoders and a class of control protocols based on the relative state feedback control law and the certainty equivalence principle .",
    "the closed - loop dynamics of the cooperative stabilization and the state estimation errors are coupled by the nonlinearities generated by the finite - level quantization scheme . by investigating the structural and asymptotic properties of the overall closed - loop equations , we give some necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for achieving inter - agent state observation and cooperative stabilization jointly w.",
