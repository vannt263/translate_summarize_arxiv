    "the presence of finite angular momentum in a prestellar cloud core provides a significant obstacle to the formation of stellar - sized objects , contributing to the overall `` angular momentum problem '' of star formation .",
    "even the relatively small ( @xmath2 km s@xmath3 pc@xmath4 rad s@xmath3 ) rotation rates measured in cloud cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imply that most of the infalling matter will land on a protostellar disc rather than directly on to the protostar .",
    "indeed , discs are observed or inferred around at least some class 0 and class i protostars , most t tauri stars , and even around brown dwarfs .",
    "however , the observed mass ratios between the disc and central object are typically @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this implies that there is an efficient mechanism to transport angular momentum outward and mass inward that sets in very early during the life of the disc and even while it is forming .",
    "@xcite have recently modeled numerically the self - consistent collapse of a rotating molecular cloud leading to the formation and evolution of a protostellar disc . during the early ( @xmath6 myr ) evolution ,",
    "mass infall from the core envelope can episodically destabilise the disc through gravitational instability and lead to the formation of spiral structure and dense clumps within the arms .",
    "gravitational torques associated with the spiral arms drive the clumps on to the protostar , generating mass accretion and luminosity bursts comparable to those observed in fu ori stars . during this early phase ,",
    "most of the protostellar mass is accreted during the bursts rather than in the quiescent phase between the bursts .",
    "the early burst phase terminates when the infalling envelope has lost most of its gas reservoir .",
    "the protostar then enters a t tauri phase and its subsequent evolution is characterised by a low - level accretion . the physical mechanism or mechanisms that drive this low - level accretion",
    "are not well understood .",
    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been suggested as the means of angular momentum and mass transport in protostellar discs .",
    "however , the thermal ionisation in most parts of t tauri discs is too low to allow sufficient magnetic coupling for the mri to operate .",
    "this problem may be mitigated by invoking nonthermal ionisation by cosmic rays in the upper layers of the disc @xcite , or x - rays from the central star @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that the mri - induced activity can indeed extend to the disc midplane at distances @xmath7 au under some circumstances .",
    "nevertheless , the overall ability of partial unstable regions of the disc to drive effective transport throughout the disc remains unresolved .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have recently suggested that a combination of the mri and gravitational instabilities may be necessary to explain the observed accretion rates for at least the more massive t tauri stars .",
    "given the lingering uncertainties associated with the mri and the additional suggestion made by @xcite that disc masses may have been systematically underestimated ( due to poorly constrained dust opacities ) , it is tempting to consider the t tauri accretion phase as merely the residual phase of gravitationally driven accretion .",

    "* ) . however , it is not clear when this phase begins and gravitational instabilities cease to operate . in our opinion ,",
    "the fundamental limitation of the above numerical simulations is in the isolated nature of the model discs .",
    "the onset of the axisymmetric phase ( if any ) should depend not only on the disc physics but also on the physics of the surrounding medium .",
    "the infall of gas from the surrounding envelope ( certainly in the early evolutionary phase ) or gravitational perturbations from companions and parent nonaxisymmetric molecular cloud can drive a protostellar disc away from an axisymmetric state .",
    "a memory of initial core conditions also determines the distribution of angular momentum and mass in the disc as well as its intrinsic size .",
    "edge - effects can certainly affect the disc s ability to support persistent density fluctuations , as we emphasise in this paper . as @xcite pointed out",
    ", even small density fluctuations of the order of a few per cent in a self - gravitating disc can create gravitational torques that can provide angular momentum transport comparable to what is often invoked via the ad - hoc @xmath9-viscosity mechanism .",

    "the surface density profile ( second row ) is also proportional to @xmath1 in much of the disc , with the exceptions of near the inner and outer boundaries .",
    "this profile has a similar form as the minimum mass solar nebula , @xmath75 g @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the mild decrease in surface density near the disc s inner boundary is caused by the inflow condition on the inner computational boundary . at the same time",
    ", the surface density at several tens of au shows a sharp drop by many orders of magnitude , implying that the disc has a sharp physical boundary .",
    "_ this is an important new result of our self - consistent calculation of disc formation .",
    "_ we emphasise that the outer computational boundary is at 8000  au and has virtually no influence on the protostellar disc dynamics or the formation of its sharp edge .",
    "the disc grows in radius from approximately @xmath76  au at @xmath77  myr to about @xmath78  au at 3  myr .",
    "the third row shows that the disc , in contrast to the envelope , is decidedly nonisothermal . as with @xmath34 and @xmath11 ,",
    "there is a sharp drop in temperature at the disc edge .",
    "the temperature generally increases inward as the surface density increases , in accordance with the barotropic equation of state .",
    "nevertheless , the variation in temperature within the disc is much less than the variations in @xmath34 and @xmath11 , which follow power - law profiles .",
    "we note that the temperature distribution in our model disc during the late accretion phase is an approximate value since we have not included the complex roles of stellar irradiation and radiative transfer .",
    "the model of @xcite , which accounts for heating from a central star onto a passive minimum mass solar nebula model , yields temperatures in the range 50 - 60 k for a disc at 10 au , in comparison to our model temperature of 40 k at this radius at late times . more detailed models by @xcite , who add viscous dissipation within the context of steady - state accretion in an @xmath9-prescription ( the resulting surface density is much shallower than @xmath1 ) , yield even greater midplane temperatures in many cases , but generally agree with the @xcite model for an accretion rate 10@xmath79  yr@xmath3 .",
    "an exact comparison of our calculated temperatures with either of these models is difficult due to their sensitive dependence on disc flaring , a quantity that we do not follow in this study , and due to the different surface density distribution of our model discs .",
    "the radial distribution of the azimuthally - averaged toomre parameter @xmath80 is shown in the fourth row of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . a substantial portion of the disc at @xmath66  myr and @xmath67  myr is characterised by @xmath81 below a fiducial critical value of @xmath82 ( estimated from the linear analysis of * ? ? ?",

    "if @xmath8 falls below a critical value @xmath83 , the gas disc becomes vigorously unstable , develops a spiral structure , and may even fragment to form dense clumps within the arms .",
    "accretion on to the central sink as well as heating induced by density enhancements work to restore @xmath8 back toward the critical value . ultimately , the near @xmath1 surface density profile within the disc that is illustrated in the second row is a result of this self - regulation of the toomre parameter coupled with the near - keplerian angular velocity and relatively weak temperature variation .",
    "we note that our obtained distribution of the azimuthally averaged toomre parameter is qualitatively similar to that obtained by @xcite using sph simulations of isolated discs with a simple parametrisation for the cooling function .    although @xmath8 can not drop to arbitrarily _ low _ values , what prevents the disc from quickly achieving a _ high _",
    "@xmath8 state in which density fluctuations are quickly washed out due to pressure gradients or shear ?",
    "we believe that the answer is swing amplification .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the transition between stable and unstable phases is usually a smooth process rather than an instantaneous switch .",
    "there can exist a situation when the disc sustains low - amplitude density perturbations for a substantially long time even though the toomre parameter averaged over the whole disc is above the critical value and the disc is stable _",
    "globally_. this phenomenon can take place if gravitational instability is powered by swing amplification .",
    "amplification occurs when any leading spiral disturbance unwinds into a trailing one due to differential rotation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) .",
    "the importance of swing amplification is in its essentially local nature ",
    "it provides transitory gravitational amplification to a local patch of gas where a leading spiral disturbance unwinds into a trailing one and the stabilising influence of shear is temporarily cancelled @xcite .",
    "it is important to realise that swing amplification can work when the disc is stable globally but unstable _ locally_. in this case , spiral density perturbations would be amplified locally ( if local conditions favour gravitational instability ) but the gain would be too small for gravitational instability to grow globally throughout the disc . in order for this process to work for a long time , a feedback mechanism must be present that constantly feeds a gas disc with leading spiral disturbances @xcite . in this case , a reflection of trailing spiral disturbances from the sharp outer disc edge can provide the necessary feedback mechanism .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the @xmath64-parameter when considering the effect of swing amplification .",
    "it is defined as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the circumferential wavelength of an @xmath86-armed spiral disturbance , @xmath87 is the longest unstable wavelength in a cold disc , and @xmath88 is the epicyclic frequency . according to @xcite ,",
    "the gain from the swing amplifier in a gaseous disc is greatest when @xmath89 . generally speaking ,",
    "swing amplification is most efficient when @xmath90 . for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the swing amplifier",
    "is strongly moderated by local shear and gas pressure , respectively .",

    "it is evident that the favourable conditions for swing amplification are present in the inner few tens of au and the maximum gain of the swing amplifier is expected for higher order modes @xmath95 .",

    "a substantial portion of the disc at @xmath66  myr is characterised by @xmath97 . a steady increase of @xmath98 with radius",
    "is evident , suggesting that density perturbations are powered by the swing - amplified spiral disturbances reflected off the disc outer edge .",
    "the magnitude of relative density perturbations decreases with time , which agrees with a gradual stabilisation of the disc inferred from the temporal evolution of @xmath80 .",

    "we note that this pattern fluctuates with time . even though the net global effect of negative and positive torques appears ( by eye ) to cancel out",
    ", it is clear that the net inward mass accretion exhibited by our model requires a residual negative gravitational torque ( due to the density inhomogeneities ) , at least within the inner disc .",
    "to further investigate the net effect of local positive and negative gravitational torques when averaged over a significant portion of the disc , we calculate the cumulative gravitational torque @xmath106 in a radial bin between 200  au and @xmath107 . for instance",
    ", @xmath108 would represent the sum of all local gravitational torques @xmath104 starting from 200  au and ending at @xmath109  au .",
    "the gravitational torques are expected to be small at large radial distances due to both the low gas surface density and effective axial symmetry in the envelope .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the resulting integrated gravitational torque as a function of radial distance at four evolutionary times . clearly , it is virtually zero at large radial distances . moving radially inward ,",
    "the integrated gravitational torque first becomes positive and then becomes negative .",
    "this implies that the outer parts of the protostellar disc are dominated by _ positive _ gravitational torques , whereas the inner regions of the disc are dominated by _ negative _ gravitational torques .",
    "this important feature contributes to the overall mass and angular momentum redistribution within the disc .",

    "is obviously transported outward , which is indicated by a developed positive slope in the radial distribution of @xmath115 . outside the disc ,",
    "the specific angular momentum remains nearly spatially uniform though growing with time .",
    "a diffusive nature of the radial mass transport in the late evolution of the disc can be visualised by considering the temporal evolution of a radially narrow gas annulus located initially at some distance from the inner disc boundary .",
    "any mechanism of radial mass and angular momentum transport will change the radial position and shape of the annulus during the subsequent evolution . to perform this test",

    "we solve a separate continuity equation for the annulus starting at @xmath67  myr , when the protostellar disc has reached a radial size of approximately 50  au .",

    "this behaviour is in agreement with a diffusive nature of the radial mass transport in a protostellar disc .",
    "because the net gravitational torque is negative , the annulus spreads out predominantly inward , resulting in a radially declining surface density profile at @xmath116  myr . to quantify this effect , we find the percentile of the initial mass of the annulus ( @xmath117 ) that was transported inwards and outwards of its initial location between 20  au and 25  au . at @xmath116  myr ,",

    "the gravitational torques are responsible for inward mass transport at a rate that is in agreement with typical accretion rates inferred in t tauri star discs @xcite .",
    "persistent nonaxisymmetric density perturbations are the key ingredient that leads to the gravitational torques .",
    "the amplitude of these nonaxisymmetric density perturbations decreases with time but the decline is moderated by the action of swing amplification , aided by the presence of a self - consistently - formed sharp edge at the interface between the protostellar disc and core envelope .",
    "the disc self - regulation by gravitational torques maintains a near - uniform value of the azimuthally - averaged toomre @xmath8 parameter .",
    "the mass accretion also maintains the disc - to - star mass ratio to be @xmath121 , and the rotation rate within the disc is approximately keplerian .",
    "since the temperature variation in the disc is much smaller in magnitude than the power - law variation in @xmath34 , the self - regulated state with near - uniform @xmath8 implies that the surface density @xmath122 .    the near uniformity of @xmath8 may be understood using an analogy to convection in stellar envelopes .",
    "a highly superadiabatic temperature gradient can not be maintained in a stellar envelope , since convection will set in and bring the temperature gradient back to a near - adiabatic value .",
    "similarly , gravitational torques work to maintain @xmath8 at essentially the stability limit .",
    "however , it must be emphasised that _ our model discs are not turbulent_. there are density perturbations in the disc , but they are not fed in globally from the largest scales of the disc and are indeed declining in amplitude over time .",
    "the swing amplification mechanism does sustain the structure for a substantially long time , but is driven by transient local gravitational instabilities .",
    "we do not believe that the labels `` turbulent '' or even `` gravitoturbulent '' are justified : rather we refer to this mode as `` self - regulated gravitational accretion '' .",
    "the @xmath122 profile is in agreement with estimates of the minimum mass solar nebula @xcite , made by adding the solar abundance of light elements to each planet and spreading the masses through zones surrounding the planetary orbits",
    ". the disc - to - star mass ratio in our model remains greater than that inferred for the solar nebula or for typical external star - disc systems .",
    "however , @xcite have recently pointed out that disc masses based on dust emission may be systematically underestimated . in any case , other transport mechanisms , primarily associated with magnetic fields , may indeed operate in real discs , and may also be more important in the inner 5 au that we do not model . since the level of magnetic coupling in the disc also remains uncertain , our model provides a very clear physical baseline for the global behaviour of discs before accounting for other more poorly - understood effects .

    "in principle , the torques due to artificial viscosity ( present in our eulerian numerical hydrodynamics code ) could also contribute to the radial transport of mass and angular momentum . to quantify this effect",
    ", we calculate the net artificial viscosity torque in the disc @xmath123 , defined as the sum of local artificial viscosity torques @xmath124 in the inner 600  au . here",
    ", @xmath125 is the surface area occupied by a cell with polar coordinates @xmath126 and @xmath127 is the artificial viscosity pressure defined according to the usual von neumann & richtmyer prescription ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the net gravitational torque @xmath128 is found by summing all local gravitational torques @xmath104 in the inner 600  au . we find that @xmath123 is at least ten orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath129 and fluctuates near zero during the evolution , meaning that the positive and negative artificial viscosity torques essentially cancel each other globally .",
    "furthermore , we must make sure that even the negative part of the artificial viscosity torque can not compete with the corresponding negative gravitational torque and lead to spurious radial mass transport .",
    "hence , we also calculate the total _ negative _ torques due to gravity and artificial viscosity by summing only negative values of @xmath104 and @xmath130 in the inner 600  au , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows these total negative torques at different evolutionary times .",
    "the negative torque due to gravity is clearly many orders of magnitude greater than the negative torque due to artificial viscosity , especially in the late disc evolution when the spiral arms have disappeared .",
    "these tests enable us to conclude that artificial viscosity has little influence on the radial transport of mass in our numerical simulations .",
    "a decisive test to confirm the principal role of gravitational torques is to see if a non - self - gravitating disc can drive accretion rates comparable to those in the self - gravitating disc . to do this",
    ", we turn off self - gravity at @xmath131  myr , i.e. just before disc formation but well after the central protostar has formed .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the previously calculated @xmath132 with self - gravity ( black line ) as well as the newly computed @xmath132 in the absence of self - gravity ( red line ) .",
    "the two rates are identical before the disc forms at @xmath50  myr .",
    "afterwards , @xmath132 in the non - self - gravitating disc declines quickly to a remarkably low value @xmath133  yr@xmath3 during 0.1  myr , confirming the principal role of self - gravity and gravitational torques in driving the mass accretion in our model .",
    "we also note that it is not possible to follow the simulations further in time , since the gas density near the inner boundary becomes negative .",
    "this is because the accretion is then driven by small numerical imperfections of the inner inflow computational boundary . as a result ,",
    "the computational cells that are immediately adjacent to the inner boundary can become depleted of gas due to the absence of gravitationally driven inward transport of gas from the outer disc ."
