    "natural images contain a variety of perceptual information enabling the viewer to infer the three - dimensional shapes of objects and surfaces @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed that surface geometry mainly has three effects on the appearance of texture in images : foreshortening and scaling of texture elements , and a change in their density .",
    "@xcite proposed the slant , the angle between a normal to the surface and a normal to the image plane , as a measure for surface orientation .",
    "stevens amended this by introducing the tilt , the angle between the surface normal s projection onto the image plane and a fixed coordinate axis in the image plane . in this paper , we will directly infer the surface normal from a single image taken under standard perspective projection .",
    "statistical procedures for estimating surface orientation often make strong assumptions on the regularity of texture .",
    "@xcite assumes observed edge directions provide the necessary information , while @xcite consider circular texture elements with uniform intensity .",
    "@xcite consider the bias of the orientation of line elements isotropically oriented on a 3d plane , induced by the plane s orientation under orthographic projection , along with a computational approach related to kanatani s texture moments @xcite .",
    "@xcite locally estimate `` texture distortion '' in terms of an affine transformation of adjacent image patches .",
    "the strong homogeneity assumption underlying this approach has been relaxed by @xcite , to a condition that is difficult to verify in practice .",
    "@xcite eliminates assumptions on the non - local structure of textures ( like homogeneity ) altogether and aims to estimate shape from the deformation of individual texture elements .",
    "@xcite criticize prior work due to the restrictive assumptions related to homogeneity , isotropy , stationarity or orthographic projection , and claim to devise a shape - from - texture approach in the most general form .",
    "their work , however , also relies on estimating the deformation of single texture elements , similar to @xcite .",
    "we propose a general framework for inferring shape from near regular textures , as defined by @xcite , by applying the locally scaled point process model of @xcite .",
    "this framework enables the simultaneous representation of local variability and global regularity in the spatial arrangement of texture elements which are thought of as a marked point process .",
    "we preprocess the image to obtain a probability map representing an unnormalized intensity estimate for the underlying point process , subsequently apply a non - parametric framework to infer the point locations and based on the resulting point pattern , learn the parameters of a locally scaled point process model to obtain a compact description of 3d image attributes .",
    "point process models have previously been applied in image analysis applications where the goal is the detection of texture elements , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "these approaches usually apply a marked point process framework , with marks describing the texture elements .",
    "such set - ups rely on a good geometric description of individual texture elements , limiting the class of feasible textures . as our goal is not the detection of individual texture elements but the extraction of 3d information",
    ", we omit the modeling of each texture element and infer the latent point locations in a model free manner .",
    "thus , our sole assumption regarding texture element shape is approximate convexity which offers considerable flexibility .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contains preliminaries on image geometry followed by the method section describing the image preprocessing , the point pattern detection and the point process inference framework .",
    "we then present results for both simulated and real images with near regular textures .",
    "finally , the paper closes with a short discussion section .",
    "let @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , denote a 3d plane with unknown unit normal @xmath3 and distance @xmath4 from the origin .",
    "we assume @xmath3 to be oriented towards the camera , forming obtuse angles @xmath2 with projection rays @xmath5 .",

    "we consider the basic pinhole camera @xcite and among the internal parameters , we only look at the focal length @xmath10 which depends on the field of view , see fig .",

    "the scaled visible image domain is @xmath18 \\times [ -1/2,1/2]$ ] .",

    "taking , for instance , the fronto - parallel plane @xmath23 results by merely in the constant scale factor @xmath24 , i.e.  the homogeneous density @xmath25 .",
    "however , for arbitrary orientation @xmath3 , this factor depends on @xmath5 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : regular points ] .",
    ".   then quantifies perspective foreshortening and inhomogeneity of the texture , respectively , as observed in the image , and mathematically represents the visually apparent texture gradient .",
    "in a first step , we apply image preprocessing that generates a probability map @xmath26 representing the spatial arrangement of texture elements in the image . to this end , two elementary techniques are locally applied : boundary detection and the corresponding distance transform .",
    "the former step entails either gradient magnitude computation using small - scale derivative - of - gaussian filters @xcite or , for texture elements with less regular appearance , the earth - mover s distance @xcite between local histograms .",
    "inspecting in turn the histogram of the resulting soft - indicator function for boundaries enables one to determine a threshold and apply the distance transform .    in our framework ,",
    "the texture elements are regarded as a realization of a marked point process where the underlying point pattern is latent .",

    ", we estimate the latent point process @xmath46 as @xmath47    formally , a point process can be described as a random counting measure @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of events in @xmath50 for a borel set @xmath50 of the relevant state space , in our context the image domain @xmath8 .",
    "the intensity measure of the point process is given by @xmath51 and the associated intensity function is @xmath52 for a homogeneous point process , it holds that @xmath53 for some @xmath54 , while for an inhomogeneous point process where the inhomogeneity stems from local scaling @xcite we obtain @xmath55 for some scaling function @xmath56 with parameters @xmath57 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath58 acts as a local deformation in that it locally affects distances and areas .",
    "more precisely , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the @xmath61-dimensional volume measure and @xmath62 its scaled version for @xmath63 .",
    "for identifiability reasons , @xcite propose normalizing @xmath58 to conserve the total area of the state space .",
    "that is , they define the normalizing constant of the scaling function such that @xmath64 @xcite and @xcite specifically consider the exponential scaling function with @xmath65 .",
    "this scaling function is particularly attractive in that locally scaled distances can be calculated explicitely , @xmath66 for any @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the euclidean distance and @xmath69 its scaled version .",

    "@xmath73 restricting the range of the scaling parameter @xmath74 ensures that @xmath2 and therefore depends on the focal length @xmath75 as well as on the size and location of the observation window @xmath8 .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , we normalize the scaling function such that holds .",
    "that is , we solve @xmath76 it follows that @xmath77 a more general result for @xmath78 \\times [ b_1 , b_2]$ ] is given in the appendix .    under the model in",
    ", the intensity function in becomes @xmath79 with @xmath80 as in . as a byproduct , the unknown plane parameter @xmath4 cancels .",
    "it sets the absolute scale and can not be inferred from a single image .",
    "furthermore , the scaling function is computationally tractable and , as for the exponential scaling discussed above , the scaled distance function is available in closed form , @xmath81 provided that the basic requirement @xmath82 is fulfilled for all @xmath83 .",
    "examples of scaled distances are given in fig.[fig : our scaling ] . when compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : exponential scaling ] , we see that the perspective scaling in results in similar distance scaling as the exponential scaling while it also provides a coherent description of the perspective foreshortening .    for a given image , we assume that the focal length @xmath75 is known . it remains to estimate the parameters @xmath84 of the intensity function in based on the estimated point pattern @xmath46 .",
    "the desired 3d image information , the slant and the tilt of the surface , may then be characterized by the scaling parameter estimates @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the parameter estimation is performed by maximizing the composite likelihood , see e.g. @xcite , that takes the form @xmath87 the maximum composite likelihood estimate for @xmath88 is @xmath89 . for the remaining two parameters  the parameters of interest in our setting  we maximize the function @xmath90",

    "the separation of image preprocessing and point detection on one hand and the estimation procedure for the scaling parameters on the other hand offers great flexibility .",
    "we believe that the locally scaled point process framework can be applied in more general settings to analyse point patterns in images , for instance , as a new additional inference step in the texture detection algorithms discussed in @xcite and references therein . due to the low computational budget of our framework",
