    "recent studies on the solid solutions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 have confirmed the existence of a quantum phase transition tuned by chemical doping from topological insulators to trivial band insulators @xcite . a topological phase transition from a 3d dirac semimetal to a trivial semiconductor",

    "the change of the band structure and the electrons , especially in the topological aspect , can not be addressed in detail .    in this study , we report the single - crystalline @xmath24 obtained from high - temperature solution growth .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements revealed structural transitions from a body - center tetragonal phase for @xmath2 , to a primary tetragonal phase for @xmath25 , and then back to a body - center tetragonal phase for @xmath26 .",

    "single crystalline @xmath24 samples were grown from high temperature solutions with the initial concentration of starting elements being @xmath27 .",
    "the mixtures were sealed in evacuated quartz ampoules , and then kept at a high temperature between @xmath28 and @xmath29 for two days , and then slowly cooled down to @xmath30 with a rate of @xmath31hour . after staying at @xmath30 for one day , the ampoules were centrifuged to separate crystals from flux .",
    "the single crystals of @xmath2 were mainly 3d bulks with triangular facets , but several needle - like crystals were found in the growth as well .",
    "the shapes of the crystals were similar as that described in ref.@xmath32[20,21 ] .",
    "when zinc was added to the solutions , the sizes of the 3d crystals decreased , while some flake - like crystals with smooth or mesa - landscape - like surfaces appeared . for @xmath33 , the flake - like crystals were dominant and no 3d crystals appeared in the growth .",
    "xrd measurements revealed that both the triangular facets ( fig .",

    "the linear relation of the measured zinc concentrations @xmath22 and the initial @xmath38 is shown in fig .",
    "by weighing the mass of the crystals yielded in every growth , we found that all the initial stoichiometric zinc was compounded in the crystals .",

    "this result is same with what observed in polycrystalline @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "single crystals were polished to bars with length @xmath40 , width @xmath41 and thickness @xmath42 for electrical transport measurements .",

    "both @xmath2 and @xmath3 were reported to crystallize in a body - center tetragonal phase @xcite .",

    "our powder xrd measurements revealed that @xmath24 have different crystal structures for different @xmath22 at room temperature .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows that the crystals of @xmath2 grown from flux are @xmath48 phase , and their xrd pattern exhibits the characteristic peaks of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the body - center tetragonal phase for @xmath60 .",

    "some samples show single frequencies from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , while the second and third frequencies as large as @xmath103 occur in other samples .",
    "such strong sample - dependence and complicated multi - frequency features indicate that the samples for @xmath100 are semimetals or very narrow bandgap semiconductors with complicated fermi surface which is strongly influenced by subtle changes of chemical potential .    as shown in fig . 5 , the temperature dependent amplitudes of the sdh oscillations were fitted by the lifshitz - kosevich formula @xcite :    @xmath104    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the boltzmann s constant",

    "the field dependent hall resistivity of the samples for @xmath92 shows a linear negative profile with sdh oscillations on the background .",

    "the carrier density decreases linearly with increasing @xmath22 from @xmath72 to @xmath83 ( fig .",

    "the samples manifest a semiconducting @xmath84 profile while multi - frequencies were observed in the sdh oscillations in their @xmath13 .",
    "the hall signals and the resistivity indicate two types of carriers . for @xmath124 ,",
    "the hall signals become large and positively field - dependent , which indicate @xmath7-type semiconductors consistent with low carrier concentrations .",
    "the change of the carrier density @xmath125 and mobility @xmath126 with respect to @xmath22 is summarized in fig .",
    "our measurements show that the change of the electrical properties of @xmath24 has no observable correlation with the structural transitions .",

    "only two dirac cones protected by rotational symmetry cross the fermi level @xmath129 along the high symmetric line @xmath130 in the brillouin zones @xcite . therefore a structural transition can not influence the bands near the @xmath131 .",
    "previous studies showed that the calculation and experiments , the negative gap is about @xmath132 for @xmath2 @xcite , while the direct gap is @xmath133 for @xmath3 @xcite . with a semimetal and a semiconductor as two terminals ,",
    "the band inversion transition should accompany a metal - semiconductor transition at a certain @xmath22 .",
    "if we assume that the band gap of @xmath24 changes linearly with respect to @xmath22 @xcite , the critical point of the band inversion transition is estimated to occur in the range of @xmath134 .",
    "this estimation is consistent with our experimental results .",
    "the critical point can also be estimated by considering the change of the soc strength in @xmath24 . here",
    "we assume that the band inversion is solely induced by the change of the soc strength , which is proportional to @xmath135 in case of the hydrogenic wavefunctions in a coulomb field where @xmath136 is the nuclear charge and @xmath8 is the principal quantum number @xcite .",
    "then the critical point is estimated as @xmath137 , which is very close to the experimental result : @xmath1 .",
    "the band structure calculation for @xmath138 revealed a topological phase transition from a dirac semimetal to a trivial semiconductor induced by the change of the soc strength @xcite .",
    "when @xmath22 increases , the two dirac points along the @xmath139 axis gradually move closer and then merge at the @xmath140 point under the protection of the crystal symmetry .",
    "a direct band gap is opened beyond the critical point .",
    "the process of the band inversion transition in @xmath24 should be similar as that in @xmath138 . despite of large chemical replacement in the crystals , the dirac cones are robust , which is supported by the vanishing disorder self - energy around the crossing points @xcite .",
    "further investigation such as arpes measurements for @xmath24 will help to reveal the details of this topological phase transition .",
    "@xmath2 is always @xmath8-type due to @xmath141 vacancies , while @xmath3 is @xmath7-type because extra @xmath23 vacancies serve as electron acceptors @xcite .",
    "since both two types of carriers come from element vacancies , an @xmath8 to @xmath7 transition is expected in @xmath24 . with increasing @xmath22",
    ", the zinc doping will suppress the chemical potential , which crosses a small fermi surface near the dirac cones .",
    "the decrease of @xmath120 with increasing @xmath22 is a comprehensive result of the change of the band structure and chemical potential .    for @xmath100",
    ", we found strongly sample - dependent frequencies of sdh oscillations .",
    "for a very narrow bandgap semiconductor or semimetal , any small change of the carrier concentrations will affect the chemical potential dramatically near the band touching . the strong sample - dependence and the complicated sdh oscillations in this regime are not unexpected .",
    "single crystals of @xmath24 were synthesized from high - temperature solutions . based on the analysis of the electrical properties , we realized a transition from a 3d dirac semimetal to a semiconductor with the critical point @xmath1 in these solid solutions .",
