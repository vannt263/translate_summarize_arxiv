    "with the advent of highly sensitive spectropolarimeters like the zurich imaging polarimeter ( zimpol ) we now have access to the linearly polarized spectrum of the sun that is due to coherent scattering processes in the sun s atmosphere ( and which has nothing to do with the well - known transverse zeeman effect ) .",

    "this line arises due to the transition @xmath6 .",

    "but in case of the sc  ii 4247  line system , we see from table  [ omega ] that @xmath54 is much greater than one .",
    "this partly explains the large depolarization in @xmath1 at the line center .",
    "when the hfs constants are rescaled by a factor of 50 or 100 , such that @xmath54 approaches unity , the central peak rises up .",
    "this again is a proof of the principle of spectroscopic stability being satisfied .",

    "such a modification , once again , reduces the decoherence and hence the depolarization .",
    "profiles computed by modifying one of the hfs wavelengths and by modifying the abundance of sc.,width=257 ]    one can notice from figure  [ hfs - mod ] that the width of theoretical @xmath1 profile and the amplitude of the prd peaks are larger than in the observed profile . both of these are sensitive to the solar abundance of sc .",
    "discuss the uncertainty in the abundance value of sc in the sun .",
    "their study is based on modeling the observed intensity profiles of different sc lines .",
    "they find that different abundances are needed to fit different lines and conclude that the abundance value is @xmath57 .",
    "the long dashed line in figure  [ hfs - mod ] is the profile computed with an abundance of 2.90 . with this reduced abundance , the fit to the prd peaks and the near wing continuum in the @xmath1 profile improves .",
    "in addition to the hfs , collisions can significantly modify the line core polarization of the observed profiles .",
    "the contribution from collisional redistribution depends on the branching ratio @xmath58 . in case of the sc  ii 4247  line , this contribution is insignificant .",
    "figure  [ fig2a ] shows the individual contributions from type - ii frequency redistribution and crd , with their corresponding branching ratios being multiplied .",
    "we note that in our computations the type - iii redistribution has been replaced with crd like in to reduce the computing time",
    ". this replacement does not affect the stokes profiles .",
    "profile from type - ii frequency redistribution and crd .",
    "the profiles before and after multiplying the branching ratios are shown.,width=257 ]    the variation of the branching ratios @xmath59 and @xmath36 as a function of height in the atmosphere for the falp model is shown in figure  [ branch ] .",
    "@xmath36 takes a value close to zero at higher layers in the atmosphere . since the sc  ii  4247  line is formed in the upper chromosphere , the contribution to the line center is primarily from type - ii redistribution .",
    "the @xmath1 profile @xmath60 crd goes nearly to zero at the line center ( dotted line in figure  [ fig2a ] ) .",
    "thus we can exclude the possibility that an approximate treatment of collisions might be contributing to the difficulties in reproducing the @xmath1 central peak .",
    "figure  [ fig2a ] also shows the @xmath1 profiles computed with type - ii redistribution and crd alone ( without @xmath59 and @xmath36 multiplied ) .",
    "the two side peaks on either side of the central peak are formed due to prd and can be reproduced only by type - ii redistribution .",
    "crd alone can not reproduce them .",
    "thus a proper account of prd is essential to model this line .",
    "the observed profiles studied till now were recorded at a limb distance @xmath28 .",
    "when the line profiles were observed at nearby @xmath41 positions , they showed a large variation in the polarization of the central peak .",
    "these profiles are shown in figure  [ allarcsec ] . at @xmath61 ,",
    "the central peak is depolarized and only the two prd side peaks stand out .",
    "the larger clv of the central peak as compared with the side peaks is to be expected from spatially varying magnetic fields , since the hanle effect can only operate in the doppler line core but not in the wings .",
    "this behavior is supported by the observed spatial fluctuations along the spectrograph slit : we find the line core amplitude of @xmath1 to vary much more than the side peaks .",
    "in contrast , the theoretical profiles computed for different @xmath41 values in the absence of magnetic fields ( cf .",
    "figure  [ sc - all - mu ] ) do not show a variation of this kind .",
    "profiles of sc  ii 4247  line observed at different limb distances.,width=264 ]    there is therefore strong reasons to believe that the line core is greatly influenced by magnetic fields via the hanle effect .",
    "this influence is normally in the form of depolarization , reduction of the polarization in the core .",
    "however , the hanle effect may also go in the opposite direction when the atomic polarization in the lower level is considered , as found by for fields of order 1 g .",
    "it therefore remains a possibility that the observed @xmath1 central peak that we are unable to reproduce with our non - magnetic modeling could be due to the hanle effect in the lower atomic level .",
    "profiles computed at various limb distances.,width=257 ]",
    "in this paper , we have tried to study the sc  ii 4247  line , the polarization profiles of which are governed by the @xmath2-state interference effects .",
    "the observations , used by us , were taken at irsol using zimpol 3 polarimeter in september , 2012 in a quiet region near the solar limb .",
    "due to its large nuclear spin , the upper and lower @xmath4-levels split into five @xmath2-states each giving rise to thirteen radiative transitions between them .",
    "the decoherence between the @xmath2-states is quite large and the emergent polarization profiles are sensitive to the energy difference between the @xmath2-states .",
    "we have investigated the sensitivity of the theoretical stokes profiles , in the absence of magnetic fields , to different atmospheric and atomic parameters .",
    "all the 1-d model atmospheres tried by us ( fal and fchht models ) , fail to reproduce the triple peak structure in @xmath1 and also the rest intensity . also , the continuum polarization predicted by all models , except falp , is larger than the observed value .",
    "the prd peaks and the near wing continuum in the theoretical profiles match closely with the observed ones only for the falp model , but this model represents faculae conditions .",
    "we also show that a proper treatment of prd is essential to model this line , and crd alone can not reproduce the prd peaks .",
    "the intensity profiles computed from the fal models match well with the observed profile except at the line center . in case of fchht models , both the line width and line depth of the theoretical profiles match poorly with the observations",
    ". it may be possible to improve the fit to the intensity profiles if multidimensional radiative transfer effects are taken into account .",
    "the @xmath1 core peak is more sensitive to the variations in atomic parameters than the atmospheric parameters .",
    "observations indicate that the central peak in @xmath1 is quite sensitive to the hanle effect . there might be positive contributions from the magnetic field to the central peak polarization through the lower level hanle effect for field strengths of order 1 g .",
    "thus , in spite of a detailed account of prd , radiative transfer and hfs effects we are unable to reproduce the central peak .",
    "all these results lead us to believe that there might be other physical effects , unaccounted for in our treatment , playing a role in shaping the @xmath1 profiles .",
    "one such effect is the mentioned lower - state hanle effect , a possibility that needs to be explored in the future .",
