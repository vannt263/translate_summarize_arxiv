    "we observed m82  at near - infrared wavelengths using the mpe integral field spectrometer 3d @xcite .",
    "a first data set was obtained at the 3.5  m telescope in calar alto , spain , on 1995 january 13 , 14 , 16 , and 21 .",
    "the observations were completed at the 4.2  m william - herschel - telescope in la palma , canary islands , on 1996 january 6 .",
    "3d slices the focal plane into 16 parallel `` slits '' which are imaged and dispersed in wavelength by a grism onto a 256@xmath13256  hgcdte  nicmos  3 array , providing simultaneously the entire @xmath0- or @xmath1-band spectrum of each spatial pixel .",
    "nyquist - sampled spectra are achieved by dithering the spectral sampling by half a pixel on alternate data sets , which are interleaved in wavelength after the data reduction . for the m82  observations ,",
    "the instrument setup provided a pixel scale of @xmath14 with a field of view of @xmath15 , and a spectral resolution of @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band , respectively .    in order to sample representative starburst regions in m82 , we selected for the observations an area approximately @xmath18 ( corresponding to @xmath19 ) , nearly parallel to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the regions mapped include the nucleus and extend to the west up to the inner edge of the molecular ring ( see figure  [ fig-3dswsfov ] ) .",
    "the 3d raster consists of four different fields , with adjacent fields overlapping by @xmath20 . each field",
    "was observed in an _ object - sky - sky - object _ sequence , with the off - source frames taken on blank portions of the sky @xmath21 away in the north and south directions .",
    "the total on - source integration times per field and wavelength channel were @xmath22 and 10 minutes for the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band data , respectively .",
    "typical single - frame exposures were @xmath23 . for atmospheric calibration ,",
    "we observed b- , late - f , or early - g dwarf stars each night , before and/or after m82 . the seeing varied from 1  to 1.5  during the observations . table  [ tab-3dlog ] summarizes the log of the observations .",
    "we carried out the data reduction using the 3d data analysis package , within the gipsy environment @xcite .",
    "we first performed correction for the non - linear signal response of the detector , dark current and background subtraction , spatial and spectral flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , rearrangement of the data in a three - dimensional cube , and bad pixel correction following standard procedures as described by @xcite .",
    "we reduced the reference stars data in the same manner .",
    "we then corrected the m82  data cubes for atmospheric transmission by division with calibration spectra obtained as follows .    in the @xmath1-band ,",
    "we first ratioed the stars spectra with a black - body curve of the appropriate temperature given their spectral type .",
    "we removed the intrinsic stellar features by division with the normalized spectrum of the star from the @xcite atlas , convolved to the resolution of 3d .",
    "this template has similar absorption line strengths as our and calibrators except for the br@xmath24  line , which we removed by linear interpolation . in the @xmath0-band ,",
    "no appropriate template spectra were digitally available , so we constructed composite calibration spectra as follows .",
    "we generated synthetic transmission spectra between 1.55@xmath4 m  and 1.75@xmath4 m   at the proper zenithal distance using the program atran @xcite .",
    "at the edges of the @xmath0-band , the transmission is very sensitive to the actual atmospheric conditions .",
    "since our reference stars have no important features bluewards of 1.55@xmath4 m  and redwards of 1.75@xmath4 m  ( within the range observed with 3d ) , we ratioed these portions of their spectrum with the appropriate blackbody curve and connected them to the synthetic spectra .",
    "the residuals from intrinsic features of the reference stars are less than 1% .",
    "those from telluric features do not exceed @xmath25 for most of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band but amount up to 20% between 1.9@xmath4 m  and 2.0@xmath4 m  and at both edges of the @xmath0-band due to spatial and temporal variability of the atmospheric transmission . by fine - tuning the airmass for the calibration spectra with the help of atran",
    ", we reduced the spurious features to less than 1% in the @xmath1-band and middle of the @xmath0-band , and less than 10% at the edges of the @xmath0-band .    for proper mosaicking , we smoothed the resulting data cubes with a two - dimensional gaussian profile to a common spatial resolution of 1.5 .",
    "the small scale structure is thus smeared out in the higher resolution fields but no important spatial features are lost .",
    "we combined the data cubes to produce the final mosaic , adjusting the mean broad - band flux in the overlapping areas to a common level .",
    "we performed absolute flux calibration based on the broad - band photometric measurements of @xcite .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties on the absolute fluxes to be 15% in the @xmath0-band and 10% in the @xmath1-band .",
    "they include possible systematic errors in the relative spatial and spectral flux distribution which may occur in the background subtraction , in the correction for telluric absorption , and in the mosaicking ( see also section  [ sub - nirimages ] ) .",
    "we obtained the mid - infrared spectrum of m82  with the sws @xcite on board _ iso _",
    "@xcite during revolution 116 on 1996 march 12 .",
    "the grating scan mode aot sws01 was used to cover the entire sws range from 2.4@xmath4 m  to 45@xmath4 m .",
    "the slowest scan speed was selected to obtain the highest spectral resolution possible in this mode ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "in addition , individual lines were scanned with the grating line profile mode aot sws02 to get full resolving power ( @xmath27 ) and improved sensitivity for the key lines used in the data interpretation .",
    "the sws rectangular aperture was centered on the western mid - infrared emission peak ( actual pointing at @xmath28 : @xmath29 , @xmath30 : @xmath31 ) .",
    "the major axis of the aperture was oriented at a position angle of 645 , nearly parallel to the galactic plane of m82 .",
    "the aperture size varies from @xmath32 at short wavelengths to @xmath33 at long wavelengths .",
    "the sws field of view thus includes the regions mapped with 3d , extending out to a maximum distance of about 350  pc from the nucleus ( see figure  [ fig-3dswsfov ] ) .",
    "the sws full scan took in total @xmath34 .",
    "the on - source integration time for the individual line scans varied between 100  s for most lines and 600  s for the weakest lines .",
    "we reduced the data with the sws interactive analysis package ( sia ) , using special interactive extensions for glitch tail removal , dark subtraction , up - down correction , flat - fielding , and defringing .",
    "as the combined spectra of the 12 detectors of each sws band are oversampled , we rebinned the final data to the proper instrumental resolution .",
    "we performed the calibration using the calibration tables as of 1998 february 15 , equivalent to olp version 7.0 .",
    "the overall accuracy of the line and continuum fluxes is estimated to be @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we selected three individual regions within the 3d field of view for a detailed analysis : the nucleus , as well as two regions covering the br@xmath24sources located approximately 10  and 5  southwest from the nucleus and which we designate as m82:br1 and m82:br2 , respectively . for convenience",
    ", we will refer to the latter regions as `` b1 '' and `` b2 '' in the rest of this paper .",
    "b1 is close to the molecular ring and b2 coincides with the western mid - infrared emission peak .",
    "these three positions were chosen because they sample , along the galactic plane of m82 , representative regions with different spectral properties indicative of different stellar populations as described below .",
    "we extracted the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band spectra of the individual regions from the 3d data cubes using synthetic apertures of @xmath36 , corresponding to @xmath37 .",
    "they are shown in figure  [ fig-3dspec ] together with those for the entire 3d field of view . all spectra exhibit the typical signatures of starburst activity , including h and he recombination lines tracing photoionized nebulae , ro - vibrational lines from warm @xmath38 , [ ] transition lines originating primarily in iron - enriched shocked material , and numerous atomic and molecular absorption features produced in the atmosphere of cool stars",
    ". however , the intensity of the features relative to the continuum varies with position .",
    "the emission lines become stronger along the sequence @xmath39 while the stellar absorption features show the opposite trend .",
    "table  [ tab-3ddata ] summarizes various continuum and line measurements obtained for the individual regions and for the 3d field of view .",
    "we computed the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band flux densities by averaging over the spectra of each region in the ranges @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . throughout this paper",
    ", we will adopt the photometric system of @xcite .",
    "we measured the emission line fluxes by integrating over the line profile after subtracting a linear continuum fitted to adjacent line - free spectral regions . due to the substantial continuum structure",
    ", these intervals were carefully selected by inspection of template spectra of k and m stars from existing stellar atlases @xcite so that the linear interpolation adequately represented the underlying continuum .",
    "we tested the validity of this procedure by integrating the line fluxes after subtracting several template spectra of stars within @xmath42 spectral classes of the representative type for each region ( determined in section  [ sect - pop_synthesis ] ) .",
    "we adopted the average fluxes , with uncertainties from the continuum subtraction corresponding to one standard deviation of the multiple measurements . at the spectral resolution of 3d ,",
    "the br11 and br12 lines at 1.6807@xmath4 m  and 1.6407@xmath4 m  are blended with the [ ] lines at 1.6769@xmath4 m  and 1.6435@xmath4 m , respectively . in these cases , we fitted double gaussian profiles to the features .",
    "the emission lines contribute at most 1.5% to the broad - band flux densities for all four regions .",
    "we measured the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the absorption feature at 1.59@xmath4 m , and of the @xmath43(6,3 ) and @xmath43(2,0 ) bandheads at 1.62@xmath4 m  and 2.29@xmath4 m  ( denoted hereafter @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) according to the definitions and corrections for resolution effects given by @xcite .",
    "such corrections were necessary in order to compare the ews for population synthesis purposes ( section  [ sect - pop_synthesis ] ) with stellar data from existing libraries given for @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band , respectively .",
    "the br14 emission line partially fills the feature in all spectra . in order to remove this contamination , we scaled the profile of the br13 line according to the intrinsic ratio @xmath49 and subtracted it at the position of br14 .",
    "this ratio is for case b recombination @xcite , assuming the electron density and temperature determined in section  [ sect - neb_analysis ] ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "differential extinction between these lines can be neglected because they are so close in wavelength .",
    "we obtained maps of the broad - band and line emission as well as of the ews from the 3d data cubes by applying to each pixel the procedure described above for the spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig-3dimages ] presents selected images and ratio maps .",
    "the spatial distributions of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band emission obtained with 3d agree well with maps in the literature ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    "the emission is generally centrally concentrated about the nucleus and small - scale structure is apparent , in particular the so - called `` secondary peak '' 8  west from the nucleus .",
    "we assessed the accuracy of the flux calibration and mosaicking by comparing the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band flux densities measured at different positions between the 3d data and the large - scale images at 1resolution from @xcite , which were obtained with a single detector array .",
    "the relative flux densities between various regions agree typically to 15% in the @xmath0-band and 10% in the @xmath1-band .",
    "the differences may be due in part to the different spatial resolution of the data sets .",
    "the br@xmath24  and  2.058@xmath4 m  line emission exhibit clumpy morphologies and follow each other very well .",
    "the ratio map , however , reveals spatial variations in the  2.058/br@xmath24  line ratio .",

    "the discrepancies between the various results are very large : up to a factor of 3.5 .",
    "they are probably attributable to uncertainties in absolute calibration and continuum subtraction .",
    "in addition , positioning errors and differences in spatial resolution for linemaps could lead to appreciably different fluxes given the clumpy morphology of the emission .",
    "we have however no obvious explanation in the case of measurements at higher spectral resolution from well - registered linemaps , as for @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both the spectral resolution and coverage as well as the quality of the 3d spectra allow a better continuum subtraction than in previous studies , supporting the accuracy of our br@xmath24  fluxes .    the @xmath46  and @xmath45  maps reveal very deep absorption features around the nucleus and the `` secondary peak , '' and progressively shallower features at b2 and b1 .",
    "the @xmath65  map is rather uniform but indicates an enhancement of @xmath45  relative to @xmath46  around b1 .",
    "the @xmath46  image is consistent with the co index map obtained at low spectral resolution by @xcite within the regions observed with 3d .",
    "the images demonstrate that the nucleus and b1 have the most extreme properties within the 3d field of view .",
    "the 3d maps and spectra indicate important spatial variations on relatively small scales in the composition of the stellar population , and support that the most recent star formation activity  as traced by the br@xmath24  emission for example  has taken place outside the nucleus , as noted previously ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    "several h recombination lines from the brackett , pfund , and humphreys series are detected as well as pure rotational lines from @xmath38  and numerous fine - structure lines from various atoms mostly in low ionization stages .",
    "broad emission features commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , a broad dip centered near 10@xmath4 m , and a rising continuum at @xmath66 likely due to very small dust grains are conspicuous ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "according to @xcite , the minimum around 10@xmath4 m  may not be due entirely to absorption by interstellar silicate grains as is usually assumed ; the presence of strong flanking pah emission complexes superposed over a weak continuum may contribute to the apparent dip . the higher signal - to - noise (",

    "we measured the emission line fluxes from both the full scan sws01 spectrum and the individual line scan sws02 spectra .",

    "in this section , we present our nebular analysis of m82 .",
    "we first derive the physical parameters critical for the interpretation of the nebular line emission : extinction , electron density , gas - phase abundances , and ionization parameter appropriate for the star - forming regions .",
    "we then use photoionization models to constrain the average effective temperature of the ob stars .",
    "the issue of extinction towards the starburst regions of m82  has long been controversial . in particular , extinctions in visual magnitudes @xmath72 ranging from a few to about 15  mag have been obtained under the assumption of a uniform foreground screen model or from optical and near - infrared diagnostics , while @xmath73 have been inferred for a mixed model or from diagnostics at longer wavelengths ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",

    "the discrepancies in extinction estimates can be understood in view of the large uncertainties in beam - size corrections involved in several studies , of those in the interpretation of some diagnostics ( such as the broad dip around 10@xmath4 m  discussed above ) , of the spatially non - uniform extinction across the disk of m82 , and of the large optical depths preventing radiation at shorter wavelengths to escape from the most obscured regions ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    "we combined our sws data with h line measurements from the radio to the optical regimes , obtained mainly in large apertures ( diameter @xmath86 ) , and with appropriate beam - size corrections .",
    "since the sws and larger apertures include the most prominent emission regions ( see the linemaps of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , the derived extinction should be representative for the bulk of ionized gas in m82 .",

    "b1 and b2 contribute however only about 5% of the total @xmath81 determined for the entire starburst core .",
    "this indicates little variation in the degree of ionization of the photoionized nebulae throughout m82 . in order to better understand this result physically , equation  ( [ eq - ueff ] )",
    "can be expressed in terms of more fundamental properties .",
    "neglecting the thin neutral atomic layer , @xmath304 and @xmath305 , where @xmath306 is the h column density of a molecular cloud core and @xmath307 is the mass of a h atom .",
    "the mean free path for lyman continuum photons is determined by the neutral surface of the clouds , @xmath308 .",
    "we also introduce @xmath309 which can be interpreted as a geometrical mean free path characterizing the path required by a lyman continuum photon to reach the outer ionized surface of a cloud .",
    "combining these relationships , equation  ( [ eq - ueff ] ) can be re - written as @xmath310 the effective ionization parameter is thus related to @xmath175 which provides a measure of the star formation efficiency .",
    "consequently , for similar gas cloud properties , the comparable @xmath167 at different locations and on various spatial scales results from a near constancy in the average star formation efficiency throughout the starburst regions of m82 .",
    "in the following , we derive further constraints that will be used in paper 2 for the application of starburst models to m82 . these include the near - infrared continuum properties for the starburst core , as well as the bolometric luminosity , the stellar mass , and the rate of supernova explosions for various regions .",
    "@xcite measured the depth of the co bandheads longwards of 2.3@xmath4 m  in a 24diameter aperture on the nucleus of m82 . from a calibration derived using the stellar atlases of @xcite and @xcite , their spectroscopic index of 0.18  mag ( which is independent of extinction ) corresponds to @xmath311   .",
    "this is essentially the global value measured for the 3d field of view accounting for 10% dilution ( @xmath312   ) .",
    "dilution can be neglected for the starburst core , since about half of the infrared emission by dust and of the nebular emission from regions originates outside of the 3d field of view while this fraction is 80% for the @xmath1-band emission ( see table  [ tab - nircont ] and section  [ sect - neb_analysis ] ) .",
    "because of the similar intrinsic @xmath46  for the 3d field of view and the central 24  as well as the relative constancy of @xmath205  within the central 500  pc , we adopted the @xmath45  for the 3d field of view as representative for the starburst core .    while the observed @xmath1-band magnitudes determined by various authors for the central @xmath313 of m82  agree well with each other , there are substantial discrepancies in the reported absolute intrinsic magnitudes ( @xmath314 ) .",
    "the results vary between @xmath315 and @xmath316 @xcite .",
    "these differences are mainly attributable to the different extinction values and model geometries assumed . we re - examined this issue using the results from our 3d and sws observations . based on the morphology of the @xmath1-band and nebular line emission and on the global distributions of the corresponding sources , we argue as @xcite that half of the extinction towards the bulk of ionized gas probably applies to the bulk of evolved stars . taking the observed @xmath1-band magnitude measured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  mag ) , an @xmath317 implies @xmath318 .",
    "similar values are obtained with the mixed extinction model for the 3d field of view ( @xmath319 ) and the effective extinction derived from the @xmath253 map ( @xmath320 ) .",
    "our results are consistent with the lower range of values reported in the literature .",
    "the 3d data trace projected regions close to the nucleus which are on average the most obscured , leading to a possible overestimate of the global extinction for the starburst core . on the other hand , large optical depths",
    "are inferred , which may indicate that the near - infrared light does not probe the stars throughout the entire galaxy along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , we will adopt an average @xmath321 , implying an effective global @xmath322 ( or @xmath323 ) towards the evolved stars in m82 .",
    "two main sources dominate the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath324 ) in m82 : the hot massive stars and the cool evolved stars . in dusty starbursts such as m82 ,",
    "the infrared luminosity ( @xmath325 ) provides a good approximation to the @xmath324  from hot stars . for the entire starburst core",
    ", we adopted @xmath326 @xcite .",
    "we estimated @xmath325  for individual regions using measurements of the mid - infrared emission which has a similar morphology as the infrared emission out to at least 100@xmath4 m , where the global energy distribution of m82  peaks @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath327 for the starburst core of m82 , where @xmath328 is the luminosity in the @xmath329-band centered at 10.8@xmath4 m , also valid within a factor of two for a sample of 11 starburst galaxies .",
    "we actually used the 12.4@xmath4 m  map of @xcite which has a spatial resolution comparable to the 3d data , scaling the fluxes according to @xmath330 derived by these authors . combining the above relationships , @xmath331 equation  ( [ eq - lir ] ) includes average extinction effects as well as contributions in the 12.4@xmath4 m  and @xmath329-bandpasses from pah emission features , emission lines , and the silicate absorption feature . from our sws and 3d data together with the fine - structure line maps of @xcite and the 3.3@xmath4 m  pah map of @xcite , we estimate that spatial variations in the spectral features and in extinction introduce errors of about 35% in applying equation  ( [ eq - lir ] ) to individual regions . following @xcite , we included an additional 30% of the detected @xmath325  in @xmath324  to account for light escaping in directions perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "individual giants and supergiants with temperatures between 3500  k and 6000  k have @xmath332 , similar to the ratio for mixed populations of cool evolved stars ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "we have thus estimated the @xmath324from evolved stars using the intrinsic stellar @xmath55  and assuming a representative ratio of 20 , with 50% uncertainty .",
    "table  [ tab - lbol ] summarizes the results for selected regions .",
    "we estimated the dynamical mass @xmath333  from position - velocity maps available in the literature .",
    "these include observations of the co @xmath334 millimeter line @xcite , of the [ ] 12.8@xmath4 m  line @xcite , and of the [ ] @xmath1159069    line @xcite .",
    "we assumed a uniform mass distribution and dynamical equilibrium , so that within projected radius @xmath335 @xmath336 where @xmath337 is the rotational velocity .",
    "since various observations of the molecular and ionized gas reveal important concentrations which are interpreted as circumnuclear rotating rings or spiral arms ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we determined @xmath337 using the peak velocity at the locations of these concentrations , corrected for an inclination of 80 , and for beam and velocity smearing .",
    "in addition , we used the dynamical mass obtained by @xcite in the central 1  of m82 , from stellar velocity dispersion measurements using the co bandhead at 2.29@xmath4 m .",
    "the resulting @xmath333  versus @xmath335 curve is plotted in figure  [ fig - mdyn ] along with the mass model proposed by @xcite .",
    "our results imply larger masses for @xmath338 , by up to a factor of @xmath339 at @xmath340 .",
    "the more recent data used here have higher resolution than those used by @xcite , and thus probe much better the central regions of m82 .    to obtain the stellar mass @xmath341 , we subtracted the gaseous mass from @xmath333 .",
    "the mass of ionized and molecular hydrogen ( @xmath273 and @xmath261 ) for the starburst core is estimated in appendix  [ app - logu ] .",
    "following the same procedure as described there for b1 and b2 , we computed @xmath273 and @xmath261 for the central 35  pc from the intrinsic @xmath163 , and from the co data of @xcite with the conversion factor between the co intensity and @xmath38 column density from @xcite at the position of the nucleus .",
    "table  [ tab - mass ] gives the various mass estimates .",
    "the resulting @xmath341 represent lower limits since the @xmath261 adopted for the starburst core was determined by @xcite in a region larger than 30  in diameter , and the gas observed towards the central 35  pc of m82  is probably mainly located in a circumnuclear ring at larger radius , as mentioned above .",
    "estimates of the global rate of supernova explosions ( @xmath342 ) in m82  from the properties of the compact , non - thermal synchrotron emission sources detected at centimeter wavelengths ( size and radio luminosity distributions , luminosity variations ) vary in the range @xmath343 ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for selected regions in m82 , we applied the relationship between @xmath342  and [ ] 1.644@xmath4mline flux derived by @xcite .",
    "our fluxes corrected for the extinction inferred from the brackett lines imply rates of @xmath344 for the central 35 pc of m82  and b1 , @xmath345 for b2 , and @xmath346 for the 3d field of view .",
    "we emphasize however that the uncertainties in @xmath342 s inferred from [ ] fluxes are very large .",
    "the calibration of @xcite is based on the integrated [ ] luminosity and radio @xmath342 , and depends on uncertain assumptions about the supernova remnants ( snrs ) lifetimes .",
    "the [ ] emission may trace a different population of snrs than radio observations , and its interpretation may be further complicated by other excitation sources such as an outflowing starburst wind ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) . a calibration based on the average intrinsic line fluxes of four compact [ ]",
    "sources candidate snrs measured by @xcite would imply @xmath342 s about 50 times smaller !",

    "<S> we present new infrared observations of the central regions of the starburst galaxy m82 . </S>",
    "<S> the observations consist of near - infrared integral field spectroscopy in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band obtained with the mpe 3d instrument , and of @xmath2 spectroscopy from the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) on board the _ infrared space observatory_. these measurements are used , together with data from the literature , to ( 1 ) re - examine the controversial issue of extinction , ( 2 ) determine the physical conditions of the interstellar medium ( ism ) within the star - forming regions , and ( 3 ) characterize the composition of the stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a set of constraints for detailed starburst modeling which we present in a companion paper .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that purely foreground extinction can not reproduce the global relative intensities of h recombination lines from optical to radio wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> a good fit is provided by a homogeneous mixture of dust and sources , and with a visual extinction of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the sws data provide evidence for deviations from commonly assumed extinction laws between 3@xmath4 m  and 10@xmath4 m . </S>",
    "<S> the fine - structure lines of ne , ar , and s detected with sws imply an electron density of @xmath5 , and abundance ratios ne / h and ar / h nearly solar and s / h about one - fourth solar . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation of the ionized gas indicates an average effective temperature for the ob stars of 37400  k , with little spatial variation across the starburst regions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a random distribution of closely packed gas clouds and ionizing clusters , and an ionization parameter of @xmath6 represent well the star - forming regions on spatial scales ranging from a few tens to a few hundreds of parsecs . from detailed population synthesis and the mass - to-@xmath1-light ratio , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the near - infrared continuum emission across the starburst regions is dominated by red supergiants with average effective temperatures ranging from 3600  k to 4500  k , and roughly solar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> our data rule out significant contributions from older , metal - rich giants in the central few tens of parsecs of m82 . </S>"
