    "light - front models are useful to describe hadronic bound states , like mesons or baryons due to its particular boost properties  @xcite . however , the light - front description in a truncated fock - space breaks the rotational symmetry because the associated transformation is a dynamical boost  @xcite .",
    "therefore , an analysis with covariant and analytical models , can be useful to pin down the main missing features in a truncated light - front fock - space description of the composite system . in this respect , the rotational symmetry breaking of the plus component of the electromagnetic current , evaluated with the drell - yan condition ( momentum transfer @xmath4 ) , was recently analysed relying on a model of a composite spin 1 two - fermion bound state with an analytical form of the vertex  @xcite .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that if pair terms are ignored in the evaluation of the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current , the covariance of the electromagnetic form factors is broken .",
    "the scalar nature of the form factors is restored only when pair terms or zero modes contributions are included in the computation of the current matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "however , the extraction of the electromagnetic form factors of a spin-1 composite particle from the microscopic matrix elements of the plus component of the current ( @xmath5 ) in the drell - yan frame , based only on the valence component of the wave function , is plagued by ambiguities due to an expected rotational invariance breaking with a truncated state  @xcite . in the breit frame , with the particular choice of the momentum transfer along the transverse direction , where the drell yan - condition is valid , the plus component of the electromagnetic current has four independent matrix elements , although only three form factors , @xmath6  and  @xmath3 are sufficient to parametrize the current of a vector particle .",
    "then , one is in principle free to choose different combinations of these matrix elements to compute form factors .",
    "but , these matrix elements satisfy an identity ,  the angular condition  @xcite , which is violated when only the valence contribution is considered  @xcite . in the corresponding literature , different extraction schemes for evaluating the electromagnetic form factors for spin-1 particles were proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the various extraction schemes amounts to the choice of matrix element of the current eliminated by assuming the angular condition .",
    "it was verified numerically , some time ago  @xcite , that the @xmath7-meson electromagnetic form factors obtained from an analytical and covariant model of the vertex using the prescription proposed in  @xcite with only the valence contribution , were in close agreement with the corresponding covariant results .",
    "it was demonstrated in  @xcite with a simplified model of the vertex and light - cone polarizations to compute matrix elements , that the prescription from  @xcite eliminates zero - modes contributions to the form factors . here",
    ", we will generalize such results by deriving analytical relations for the matrix elements  @xcite , where pair terms are implicitly included , even considering only the valence contribution , and after that the numerical calculations of the spin-1 form factors with all prescriptions found in the literature agree .",
    "we should add that zero modes or pair terms in the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current appear in different ways .",
    "for example , in the case of spin-0 particles , like for the pion or kaon , the plus component of the electromagnetic current calculated in the breit frame with the drell - yan condition does not have such contributions in simple analytical and covariant models of the vertex  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic current of a spin 1 particle has the following general form : @xmath8 ( p^\\mu + p^{\\prime \\mu } )    - f_3(q^2 )   ( q_\\alpha g_\\beta^\\mu- q_\\beta g_\\alpha^\\mu ) \\ ,    \\label{eq : curr1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the mass of the vector particle , @xmath10 is the transfer momentum , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the on - shell initial and final momentum , respectively . here",
    ", the spin-1 particle is identified with a @xmath7 meson .",
    "linear combinations of the covariant form factors @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 allow to get the charge ( @xmath1 ) , magnetic ( @xmath2 ) and quadrupole ( @xmath3 ) form factors ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in the impulse approximation",

    "the electromagnetic form factors are calculated in the breit frame with the drell - yan - west condition , @xmath21 , which gives the momentum transfer @xmath22 , the particle initial momentum @xmath23 and the the final one @xmath24 .",
    "we use the definition @xmath25 , and then the energy of the vector particle is @xmath26 .",
    "the polarization four - vectors in the instant - form basis are given by @xmath27 for the initial state and by , @xmath28 for the final state .    in order to make finite the photon - absorption amplitude",
    "; we use following regularization function @xmath29 associated with a model for the vector particle vertex with a regularization parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the vertex function of the spin-1 particle  @xcite in terms of the quark momentum is given by @xmath31 in the equation above , the vector particle is on - mass shell ; and @xmath9 is the vector bound state mass .    in the next section , the extraction schemes of the electromagnetic form factor from the plus component of the electromagnetic current and the angular condition are discussed .",

( [ eq : ang ] ) .",
    "it also allows the freedom to combine in different ways the matrix elements of the plus component of the vector particle current to compute electromagnetic form factors  @xcite .",
    "the prescription adopted by grach and kondratyuk  @xcite corresponds to eliminate the matrix element @xmath36 in the light - front spin basis , from the calculation of the electromagnetic form factors . in references",

    "@xcite , it was derived relations fulfilled by the zero - mode or z - diagram contributions to matrix elements of the plus component of the current in the instant - form basis : @xmath37 from the angular condition ( [ eq : ang ] ) and the fact that @xmath38 does not have zero - modes , i.e , @xmath39 ; we can write the non - vanishing matrix elements for the z - diagrams in terms of the valence matrix elements , starting with @xmath40 . the final form of the matrix elements of the current , where the zero - mode contributions are eliminated in favor of the valence ones through the use of ( [ finalcurr ] ) are : @xmath41 and also for light - front spin basis ,  @xmath42 , is written below : @xmath43 the equations above , make clear , in the case of the light - front spin basis , that only @xmath44 , has a zero mode contribution  @xcite , similar results are obtained also in the ref .",

    "1 , which is dominated by valence terms with the position weakly affected by the inclusion of the zero - mode contribution to the form factor . the zero modes present a tail relevant for large momentum transfers for @xmath1 and @xmath3 , while for @xmath2 the effect is somewhat attenuated .",
