    "at this conference , the phenix and star collaborations have presented hadronic transverse momentum spectra in central au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev@xcite . in comparison to rescaled @xmath2 ua1 reference data , these spectra show a depletion at high transverse momentum ( @xmath3 gev @xmath4 gev ) .",
    "this may be the first experimental indication for jet quenching  @xcite , predicted by gyulassy and wang  @xcite a decade ago .",
    "in general , hadronic transverse momentum spectra contain both a soft and a hard physics component .",
    "the hard component , which dominates at sufficiently high @xmath5 , can be calculated by convoluting the incoming parton distributions with partonic cross sections .",
    "parton fragmentation functions parametrize how the partons produced in hard processes translate into final state hadrons .",
    "thus , the origin of any medium - dependence of high-@xmath5 transverse momentum spectra has to be traced back to either i ) nuclear modifications of the initial state ( e.g. nuclear shadowing ) or ii ) medium - induced changes of the final state parton fragmentation . while information about nuclear shadowing can be obtained from other observables ( e.g. dis in e - a ) , the study of the medium - dependence of parton fragmentation functions @xmath6 is still in its infancy . here , we review recent calculations  @xcite of the radiative energy loss off hard partons which aim at describing the medium - induced shift in the energy of the fragmenting parton . for a complementary approach ,",
    "see ref .",
    "fig .  [ fig1](a ) shows a typical building block of the dglap evolution equation .",
    "this gluon radiation shifts the energy of the quark by a factor @xmath7 . to describe medium - induced changes of such partonic fragmentation patterns , we consider multiple scattering contributions , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . for the gyulassy - wang model which mimicks the nuclear medium by a set of static coloured scattering potentials ,",
    "these scattering contributions were calculated recently by several groups  @xcite .",
    "all published results are limiting cases of the following expression for the medium - induced gluon radiation cross section off a hard quark  @xcite : @xmath8 here , @xmath9 denotes the energy fraction of the hard quark , carried away by the gluon , and @xmath10 its transverse momentum .",
    "information about the nuclear medium enters via the combination @xmath11 , where @xmath12 determines the density of scattering centers in the medium , and the dipole cross section @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the two - dimensional path - integral  @xcite @xmath15\\ , ,    \\label{2.2}\\ ] ]",
    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions , hard partons typically propagate over distances @xmath16 inside the excited nuclear medium . to access this region ,",
    "we expand the radiation spectrum ( [ 2.1 ] ) in powers of opacity @xmath17 which is related to an expansion in the number of scattering centers . for arbitrary @xmath18",
    ", it can be shown that the radiation spectrum ( [ 2.1 ] ) interpolates between the classically expected @xmath18-fold scattering results in both the coherent ( @xmath19 ) and incoherent ( @xmath20 ) limiting cases  @xcite .",
    "for example , up to first order  @xcite @xmath21                    \\right]\\ , .",
    "\\label{2b.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are transverse energies , the `` hard '' term @xmath24 , @xmath25 , is the medium - independent contribution of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and @xmath26 is a shorthand for integrating over the elastic scattering cross section . eq .",
    "( [ 2b.1 ] ) is the incoherent `` classical '' parton cascade limit of ( [ 2.1 ] ) : the medium - independent hard term @xmath27 is reduced by the probability @xmath28 of an additional scattering . with the probability for this scattering ,",
    "the hard term is shifted in transverse momentum to @xmath29 , and the medium - induced gluon radiation off the hard quark leads to a gunion - bertsch radiation term @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath10-integral of the medium - dependent part of ( [ 2b.1 ] ) is the glv - radiation cross section  @xcite .",
    "this lowest order opacity approximation was compared to rhic data at this conference  @xcite .",
    "for large in - medium path length @xmath31 , the integrand of the radiation cross section ( [ 2.1 ] ) is dominated by small transverse distances @xmath32 for which @xmath33 up to logarithmic accuracy . in this quadratic approximation ,",
    "the path - integral @xmath14 is that of a harmonic oscillator , and ( [ 2.1 ] ) can be reduced to a two - dimensional integral which has to be evaluated numerically  @xcite .",
    "the medium dependence enters then via the rescattering parameter @xmath34 which parametrizes the average squared transverse momentum picked up by a hard parton per unit pathlength , @xmath35 .",
    "this is a measure of the transverse colour field strength seen by a hard parton  @xcite . in cold nuclear matter ,",
    "0.1 @xmath36 @xmath37 0.5 @xmath36 while in heavy ion collisions , one expects @xmath38 1.0 @xmath36  @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we consider the medium - induced deviation of the radiation spectrum , @xmath39 .",
    "the radiative energy loss @xmath40 is @xmath41 for @xmath42 , the @xmath10-integral goes up to the kinematical boundary @xmath43 and ( [ 3.1 ] ) gives the total radiative energy loss . for typical spatial extensions in heavy ion collisions , @xmath44 fm , we find that the radiative energy loss is very sensitive to the rescattering properties @xmath34 of the medium , see fig .",
    "its @xmath0-dependence satisfies approximately the @xmath45-law discovered by bdmps .",
    "however , the destructive interference between hard and medium - induced radiation , leads to a delayed onset of any radiative energy loss : @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] turns negative for @xmath46 fm .",
    "this increases the fraction of hard partons whose in - medium path length is too small to result in a significant medium - dependence ( `` corona effect '' ) .",
    "the @xmath47-dependence of ( [ 3.1 ] ) translates into an opening angle and allows to calculate radiative energy loss inside a finite jet cone . while the total energy radiated outside a finite angle @xmath48 decreases monotonously with increasing opening angle @xmath48 , this is not the case for the medium - induced deviation obtained from ( [ 3.1 ] ) and @xmath39 .",
    "medium - induced multiple scattering broadens the medium - independent term @xmath49 .",
    "this leads to a maximum of @xmath50 for finite opening angle . as a consequence , the @xmath10-integrated energy loss expressions @xmath51 presented in previous works are not necessarily upper bounds for the energy lost outside a realistic jet cone",
