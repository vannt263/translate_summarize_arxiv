    "adversarial dynamics are at the heart of many important security challenges .",
    "the central issue in this problem class is the existence of an intelligent , adaptable adversary able to actively counter defensive moves .",
    "models developed to increase understanding in these areas must include adaptive learning as a central component if they aim to capture the adversarial dynamics observed to dominate many real - world conflict scenarios @xcite .",
    "cyber security researchers , attempting to understand and predictably influence the highly dynamic , noisy , and innovative cyber realm , require tools that shed light on strategic interactions that are often out of equilibrium and driven by adaptive learning .",
    "furthermore , the sought after techniques should be able to account for the limited ability of real world actors to gather and process information and the consequent bounded nature of the rationality that characterizes real world adversarial opponents .    in recent years _ active cyber defense _ techniques have been an important area of research and development @xcite .",
    "a prominent example of a family of active defense techniques that have recently been under development is that of moving target defenses @xcite , which systematically vary a system s attack surface to diminish the inherent advantages cyber attackers typically enjoy @xcite .",
    "temporal platform migration systems @xcite are a class of moving target defenses that dynamically change the system interface ( e.g.  operating system ( os ) , spam filter , etc . ) over time .",
    "these techniques work under the assumption that the attacker has limited resources and generally does not have exploits for _ all _ platforms at his disposal . as such",
    ", migrating between platforms with some frequency reduces the ability for an attacker to maintain persistence on a system .",
    "additionally , it increases the uncertainty for an attacker that aims to expend resources towards countermeasure development .",
    "recent studies have examined the optimal scheduling policy for a temporal platform migration moving target defense . according to @xcite ,",
    "a uniform random scheduling of active spam filters gave superior performance against an evolving adversary .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite found that a scheduling policy that maximizes the diversity of the platforms played in each successive round as quantified by a measure of platform similarity was superior .",
    "crucially , the threat model in these studies differed , with @xcite modeling a threat that required attacker persistence in the system before a payoff accrued , in contrast to @xcite which used a simple attacker model with no requirement for persistence .",
    "the primary aim of this study is not to formulate new moving target defense strategies , but rather to develop a set of modeling tools that facilitate insight into the effect these strategies have on the potential success and strategy evolution of a cyber attacker that is able to observe a system and react adaptively to defensive moves . in this study",
    "we demonstrate a tractable approach to the modeling of adaptive strategic learning by boundedly rational agents and apply the scheme for the first time to a resource allocation problem in the cyber security domain .",
    "the modeling approach we employ involves the use of genetic algorithms , which have been used in a number of security applications and in studies of agent strategy formulation .",
    "intrusion detection systems have incorporated genetic algorithms @xcite .",
    "genetic algorithms have also been used to create active defense strategies @xcite and to generate diverse configurations in a moving target system @xcite . in his pioneering work axelrod @xcite used a genetic algorithm to explore strategy evolution in the iterated prisoner s dilemma ( ipd ) .",
    "miller @xcite ( see below ) brought together the ideas of axelrod with methods from automata theory @xcite developed to model the strategic play of boundedly rational agents .",
    "the combination of a genetic algorithm and finite state machines allows for the tractable modeling of boundedly rational agents able to learn and adapt in dynamic environments @xcite .",
    "the major contributions of this work are as follows :    1 .",
    "we present the first use of genetic algorithms to study optimal attacker strategies against temporal platform diversity defenses 2 .",
    "we quantify a _ strategic complexity _ measure to balance the cost / benefit within resource investment 3 .",
    "we study the efficacy of different defender strategies against an evolving adversary    the paper proceeds as follows : in section [ s : methods ] we formulate the problem and present our techniques and evaluation metrics . in section [ s : experiments ] we present a series of experiments in which the adaptive attacker interacts with different defender strategies , finally concluding by discussing future work in section [ s : conclusion ]",
    "we study the interaction between the attacker and defender through the dynamics of a two - player game . in our scenario",
    "the attacker observes the operating system the defender , utilizing a moving target defense , activates in each round of play .",
    "the attacker uses this information to formulate a strategy for resource investment , with the goal to bring exploits ( e.g.  countermeasures ) into existence to most effectively compromise the defender s system and maximize his own gain .    in each match",
    "( i.e.  round of play ) , the attacker uses any exploits it has developed against the activated platform .",
    "success for the attacker in a match occurs when he has an available exploit that works against the platform activated by the defender .",
    "intuitively , the attacker gains a reward if they are able to compromise the defender s system during the match , and earns nothing otherwise .",
    "one may view this as the ability for the attacker to exfiltrate data , perform reconnaissance , steal credentials , etc . ;",
    "all attacks that benefit from system access",
    ".    exploits are developed by cumulative attacker investment ; in each round of play the attacker invests a single resource to the creation of a chosen exploit . the amount of investment required to bring a given exploit into existence is randomly determined at the beginning of each game .",
    "the attacker is not informed _ a priori _ of the number of resources that will be required to bring a given exploit into existence , instead discovering this fact only after having successfully created the exploit through the required allocation of resources .",
    "this uncertainty matches reality in that a real - world attacker is not in general able to predict _ a priori _ the level of effort that will be required to develop new exploits against a given system . without loss of generality , in this initial version of the game , there exists one possible exploit for each type of platform a defender might utilize .",
    "all exploits in this study are assumed to be _ zero - day _ exploits , meaning that they are unobserved by the defender when used against the corresponding operating system .",
    "intuitively , the defender has no detection capability against an attack they have no knowledge of .",
    "this has ramifications in the sense that the defender has no means or reason to change their own defensive strategy , and hence will stick to the pre - assigned strategy .",
    "we note that while the agents in agent - based models typically manifest attributes such as heterogeneity , adaptation , interaction , autonomy , and situatedness @xcite , our current game scenario focuses primarily on one of these attributes , namely adaptive strategy development .",
    "our intention in this study is to focus on developing a powerful set of tools for modeling adaptive strategy evolution in cyber agent systems .",
    "these tools will be incorporated into more complete agent contexts in future studies .",
    "a finite - state automata or finite - state machine is an abstract machine that takes discrete inputs from an environment and specifies a discrete output in response .",
    "an agent modeled by a finite state machine will occupy only one state at any point in time .",
    "such an agent transitions between states based on triggering events .",
    "a moore machine @xcite is one kind of finite - state automata in which the output from the machine depends solely on the machine s internal state .",
    "a moore machine is formally defined by four components , @xmath0 , where q is the set of possible internal states , @xmath1 is the internal state the machine begins in , @xmath2 is a function mapping the internal states to actions in the game being played , and @xmath3 is the transition function mapping an internal state of the machine and the observed move of the opponent into the next internal state that will become active .",
    "moore machines provide a simple , yet rich and flexible tool with which to encode and evolve game strategies @xcite .",

    "1-to-1 game _ a series of contests in which the attacker faces defenders that activate os - a and os - b with approximately equal frequency in each contest .",
    "we use the term _ contest _ and the term _ game _ interchangeably to denote a set of @xmath60 matches that a single attacker plays consecutively against the defender .",
    "while within a game the frequency of os - a and os - b activation is equal , the distribution of these activations among the @xmath60 matches differs among defender types within the _ 1-to-1 _ defender family .",
    "the _ singleflip - fixedorder _ defender activates os - a in 182 consecutive matches , then switches to os - b for the next 183 matches .",
    "the defender denoted by _ singleflip - randomorder _ plays a similar strategy , but instead of predictably playing os - a for half the matches then switching to os - b , this defender instead decides uniformly at random at the start of each game whether to begin play with os - a or os - b .",

    "figure [ invbias-1to1 ] shows the investment bias ( @xmath47 ) ( see section [ invbiassection ] ) for these _ 1-to-1 _ cases .",
    "the frequency of defender os activations within a game strongly influences the investment bias of the attacker s learned strategy , with the _",

    "1-to-1 _ defender family.,width=340 ]    a clearer picture of learned attacker strategy can be gained from understanding the _ match - level _ choices the attacker is making .",
    "we find that when the defender predictably plays a monolithic os - b strategy in later rounds of the game the attacker quickly ( generationally ) learns to predict and exploit this regularity , ignoring the defender s early activations of os - a and focusing investment on the creation of zd - b for use in the second half of the game .",
    "note that this learned strategy by the attacker is also taking account for the approximate cost of zero - day exploit creation in that the attacker has learned after a few generations that it needs to begin investing in the creation of zd - b well before the defender begins activating os - b in order to gain full benefit from the defender s predictable behavior . also note that while the attacker does learn the approximate cost of exploit creation ( the mean cost of exploit creation is 100 units in this example ) , the attacker seems to believe the cost is approximately 182 units , only switching to invest in the creation of zd - a after the defender transitions from playing os - a to os - b at the 182nd round .",
    "this inability of the attacker to learn to predict the true exploit creation costs was found to be a robust feature of the learning algorithms used for the present game .",
    "we believe this observation is related to the fact that the attacker uses all available exploits against the defender s system on each match , which we speculate makes the attacker insensitive to the precise effect the play of each individual exploit is having on the game payoff .",
    "this is a topic we plan to revisit in future studies which will look at other variants of evolutionary algorithms and game structure to understand more fully why the current attacker consistently fails to distinguish the true costs of exploit creation from the ratio of defender play of said exploits .",
    "a portion of the superior performance of the attacker against the _ singleflip _ defenders can be traced to superior game - play strategies for these _ singleflip _ cases ( fig .",
    "[ 1to1triple ] ( lower ) ) , and a portion can be traced to the ability of the attacker to discover strategies of minimal complexity costs ( fig .",
    "[ 1to1triple ] ( middle ) ) .",
    "future studies will examine the robustness under @xmath44 variation of strategic complexity cost differences for attackers facing _ singleflip _ versus _ eachmatchflip _ defenders . in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ 1to1triple ] it makes intuitive sense that the attacker requires less strategic complexity to counter a defender that only changes its actions once during match play , as opposed to a defender that is executing migration policies with structure on the scale of a few matches .",
    "it is interesting to note the the attacker performs nearly as well against the _ singleflip - randomorder _ defender , which randomly chooses between two available platform migration policies at the start of each generation , as it does against the more predictable _ singleflip - fixedorder _ defender , though the less predictable _ singleflip _ defender causes a noisier attacker response .",
    "examining the match level structure of the attacker response to the _ singleflip - randomorder _ defender we find that the attacker has learned after a number of generations to observe the defender s move in _ match 1 _ of the game and predict all future os activations by the defender , thus gaining the ability to efficiently counter the defender despite the random element in the defender s policy .",
    "this has implications to other active defense techniques , such as address space layout randomization ( aslr ) @xcite , for which randomization only increases the adversary s initial uncertainty and the entire system can be compromised given a single observation .",
    "it is important to note that these results not only have implications to the attacker , who learns an optimal strategy against a specified defender , but also the defender as well . by evaluating the optimal fitness of an attacker against differing defenders",
    ", we also uncover the efficacy of different defensive strategies .",
    "if we assume the interaction is a zero - sum game  any gains by the attacker are losses by the defender  then the defender s goal should be to minimize the attacker fitness .      in the _ 2-to-1 _ game",
    "the attacker faces a set of defenders that activate os - a at a _ 2-to-1 _ ratio to os - b . as with the _ 1-to-1 _ game , in the _",
    "2-to-1 _ case the frequency of os - a and os - b activation is @xmath61 over the 365 matches taken as a whole , with the distribution of these activations among the matches differing among defender types .",
    "the evolved attacker responses to these defender policies are shown in fig.[2to1-triple ] . here",
    "singleflip - a - fixedorder _ defender activates os - a monolithically for the first 243 matches of a game , then switches to os - b for the remaining 122 matches . on the other hand , the _ singleflip - b - fixedorder _ defender begins match play by activating os - b for 122 consecutive matches , then switches to os - a for the remaining 243 matches of the game . in reaction to the different members of the _ 2-to-1 _ family of defenders we see two different classes of responses by the attacker",
    ". the first , and simpler , type of response has the attacker deciding to essentially only invest in the creation of zd - a , completely neglecting attacks against the less activated os - b .",
    "the attacker uses this class of strategy against the _ eachmatchflip - fixedalternating _ and _ eachmatchflip - uniformrandom _ defenders .",
    "we note in fig .",
    "[ 2to1-triple ] that although _ a priori _ this might seem a simple response by the attacker to biased defender policies , the strategic complexity cost is not negligible .",
    "we hypothesize that variability in the defender s os activations on the scale of a few matches is an important factor in determining the transition structure ( and so the strategic complexity cost ) of the evolved attacker machines .",
    "this implies that a simple attacker response to a highly dynamic migration policy might entail a greater strategic complexity cost than would be expected from the attacker s simple actions alone .",
    "we will return to this question in a future study .",
    "the second class of attacker response has the attacker making predictions about future defender activation activity and tuning resource investment accordingly .",
    "this prediction strategy is most successful against the _ singleflip - b - fixedorder _ defender , where the attacker learns to ignore the activation of os - b in the first 122 matches of play , investing instead in zd - a which has been brought into existence by the time the defender begins its 243 match run of os - a activation .",
    "the tactical outcome of this attacker strategy bears resemblance to the simpler class of strategies discussed above in that only the zd - a exploit ends up significantly benefiting the attacker , but the strategy underlying this result is quite different in the present case as evidenced by the distinctive investment bias result for the attacker facing the _ singleflip - b - fixedorder _ defender in fig .",

    "the attacker continues investing heavily in zd - a creation until the defender transitions to playing os - b late in the game , investing well beyond the resources required to bring zd - a into existence , resulting in a suboptimal result for the attacker .",
    "we speculate again that the learning algorithms underlying the attacker behavior are having difficulties grasping the fact that the attacker does not need to continue investing in an exploit after it has been created in order to benefit from its play against the defender .",

    "we have developed a model of adaptive strategy formulation and used it to study the choices an attacker learns to make to overcome temporal platform migration moving target defense strategies .",
    "the attacker - defender interaction has been modeled as a game in which a non - adaptive defender deploys a temporal platform migration defense . against this active defense ,",
    "a population of attackers developed strategies specifying the temporal ordering of resource investments that bring zero - day exploits into existence to compromise the defender s system .",
    "we note that in this study , the attacker has often ignored the effects of causality by learning over generations which platforms the defender will play before they are actually played in each game .",
    "this actually maps to realistic scenarios , when an attacker is able to perform reconnaissance to learn a strategy before engaging a system .",
    "random strategies do not suffer nearly as strongly as those which are predictable , suggesting that increased uncertainty , even with a defined strategy , improves defender performance .",
    "this work has strong implications in cyber security , as it enables defenders to understand their defensive posture without having to explicitly detail an attacker .",

    "<S> adversarial dynamics are a critical facet within the cyber security domain , in which there exists a co - evolution between attackers and defenders in any given threat scenario . while defenders leverage capabilities to minimize the potential impact of an attack , the adversary is simultaneously developing countermeasures to the observed defenses . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a set of tools to model the adaptive strategy formulation of an intelligent actor against an active cyber defensive system . </S>",
    "<S> we encode strategies as binary chromosomes representing finite state machines that evolve according to holland s genetic algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we study the strategic considerations including overall actor reward balanced against the complexity of the determined strategies . </S>",
    "<S> we present a series of simulation results demonstrating the ability to automatically search a large strategy space for optimal resultant fitness against a variety of counter - strategies . </S>"
