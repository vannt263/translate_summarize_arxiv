    "one of the most prominent properties of high-@xmath4 copper - oxide superconductors is that they exhibit a number of long - range orders upon changing the chemical doping , such as antiferromagnetism , superconductivity , stripe , nematic state , and so on .",
    "the competition and coexistence between superconductivity and other long - range orders are believed to be fundamental issues in the studies of high-@xmath4 superconductors . among the orders that are in competition with superconductivity ,",
    "the nematic order , which spontaneously breaks @xmath5 symmetry down to @xmath6 symmetry , has attracted special theoretical and experimental interest in the past decade @xcite .    in recent years , strong anisotropy in the electronic properties has been observed in various experiments performed on yba@xmath7cu@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite and bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "such strong anisotropy is universally attributed to the formation of an electronic nematic state @xcite in these two typical high-@xmath4 superconductors .",
    "it is very interesting to notice that similar nematic states have also been observed in a list of other correlated electron systems , including iron - based superconductor @xcite , heavy fermion superconductor @xcite , sr@xmath8ru@xmath7o@xmath11 superconductor @xcite , and even semiconductor heterostructure @xcite .",
    "motivated by the observed strong electronic anisotropy in high - t@xmath12 superconductors , many researchers anticipate the existence of a nematic quantum phase transition in these systems @xcite . such nematic transition and the associated nematic critical behaviors",
    "have been investigated extensively in the past several years @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that high - t@xmath12 superconductors have a @xmath13 energy gap , which vanishes linearly at four nodal points @xmath14 . due to this special property ,",
    "gapless nodal quasiparticles ( qps ) exist in the superconducting state even in the low - energy regime .",
    "if a nematic phase transition occurs in the superconducting dome , the fluctuation of nematic order parameter couples to the gapless nodal qps .",
    "this coupling becomes singular at the nematic quantum critical point ( qcp ) , and can lead to unusual behaviors @xcite .",
    "vojta _ et al .",
    "_ first analyzed the effective field theory of the coupling between nematic order and nodal qps by means of @xmath15 expansion and found runaway behavior @xcite .",
    "later , perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath16 with @xmath1 being the fermion flavor has been extensively applied to address this issue @xcite .",
    "for instance , kim _ et .",
    "al . _ revealed a second - order nematic phase transition after performing a large-@xmath1 analysis @xcite .",
    "more recent renormalization group calculations of huh and sachdev found a novel fixed point that exhibits extreme fermion velocity anisotropy @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies showed that such extreme anisotropy can lead to a variety of nontrivial properties , such as non - fermi liquid behavior @xcite , enhancement of thermal conductivity @xcite , and suppression of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the influence of weak quenched disorders on the nematic qcp was also addressed @xcite .",
    "we should note that all the pervious field - theoretic analysis are based on the conventional perturbative expansions @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative effects have not been seriously addressed . to illustrate this issue",
    ", we now consider the @xmath17-wave superconducting state , which has low - lying elementary excitations with spectrum @xcite @xmath18 , where the electron dispersion @xmath19 and the @xmath17-wave gap @xmath20 . in the vicinity of the gap node @xmath21",
    ", one can linearize the spectrum and obtain @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the fermion velocity of nodal qps is defined as @xmath25 and gap velocity @xmath26 . for the other three nodes ,",
    "the linearization can be performed analogously . in this formalism ,",
    "one starts from the following free fermion propagator , @xmath27 where @xmath28 are two standard pauli matrices , and then perturbatively calculates the fermion self - energy @xmath29 induced by the interaction with nematic fluctuation .",
    "generically , @xmath29 can be expanded as @xmath30 where the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the temporal and spatial components respectively .",
    "the fermion damping effect is encoded in @xmath31 @xcite , whereas the velocity renormalization can be obtained from @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "however , in principle there could be the fourth term , @xmath34 , which is defined by the third pauli matrix @xmath35 and corresponds to a nonzero mass gap term of the nodal qps .",
    "this mass term can never be obtained to any finite order of the perturbative expansion of fermion self - energy , but may be dynamically generated if one performs non - perturbative calculations .",
    "another motivation of studying the non - perturbative effects is to examine the validity of the @xmath16 expansion . when performing the standard perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath16 ,",
    "the flavor @xmath1 is usually supposed to be quite large @xcite .",
    "however , in the present nematic problem , the physical flavor of nodal qps is @xmath36 , determined by the spin degeneracy .",
    "it is very interesting , and even necessary , to go beyond the perturbative @xmath16 expansion and testify whether the non - perturbative effects give rise to any nontrivial phenomena those can not be captured by the usual perturbative calculations .    in this paper",
    ", we study dynamical gap generation of originally gapless nodal qps due to nematic fluctuation by means of non - perturbative expansion . with the help of dyson - schwinger ( ds )",
    "equation that connects the free and complete propagators of nodal qps , we obtain a nonlinear gap equation of fermion mass @xmath37 in the vicinity of nematic qcp . after solving this equation",
    ", we find that a nonzero mass gap , @xmath34 , is dynamically generated when the fermion flavor @xmath1 is below certain critical value @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "we demonstrate that the dynamical gap @xmath37 induced by nematic order corresponds to a secondary @xmath39-wave cooper pairing formation , so the critical nematic fluctuation drives a transition from a pure @xmath13 superconducting state to a @xmath40 superconducting state in the vicinity of nematic critical point . as a consequence , the superconducting state is fully gapped and the massive nodal qps",
    "are weakly confined by a logarithmic potential .",
    "moreover , the dynamical gap leads to saturation of fermion velocity renormalization and strong suppression of some observable quantities .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we perform a non - perturbative analysis by means of ds equation method and examine whether a dynamical gap can be generated by the critical nematic fluctuation . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss the physical implications of dynamical gap generation . in section 4 , we briefly summarize our results and comment on two interesting issues concerning the validity of @xmath16 expansion and disorder effects .",
    "the effective low - energy model describing the coupling between nematic order and gapless nodal qps has already been derived and extensively studied in previous publications @xcite .",
    "this effective model is composed of the following three parts @xcite @xmath41    the free action for the nodal qps is @xmath42 here , the nodal qps are described by nambu spinors @xmath43 , defined as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 with spin indices @xmath47 .",

    "qps and nematic order parameter is described by a yukawa coupling term @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the coupling constant .    according to the standard perturbation theory",
    ", one would make perturbative expansion in powers of coupling constant @xmath59 .",
    "however , as revealed by the renormalization group analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath59 tends to diverge in the low - energy region and there is no stable fixed point .",
    "it turns out that @xmath59 is not an appropriate expanding parameter in the present interacting system .",
    "it was later realized that a reasonable route to access such model is to fix the parameter @xmath59 at certain finite value @xcite , and then to perform perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath16 .        in order to carry out analytical calculations , it is convenient to assume a general fermion flavor @xmath1 .",
    "the free propagator of nodal qps is @xmath60 for @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the free propagator of the nematic order parameter is @xmath64 due to the coupling between nematic fluctuation and nodal qps , the nematic propagator can be dynamically screened , as shown in figure [ fig : feynman](a ) , and becomes @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the polarization function . to the leading order of the @xmath16 expansion ,",

    ". we can drop the @xmath71 term and write the effective nematic propagator as @xmath72    the free fermion propagator also receives corrections due to its coupling with the nematic fluctuation . after including these corrections",
    ", the complete propagator of @xmath61 takes the following general form @xmath73 where @xmath74 are wave - function renormalizations and @xmath75 is a fermion gap .",
    "the mass gap term can never be generated so long as the fermion self - energy is calculated perturbatively using the free fermion propagator @xmath76 . to examine the possibility of dynamical gap generation",
    ", we should go beyond the perturbative level and instead utilize the following self - consistent ds equation @xmath77^{-1 } - \\sigma_{1\\sigma}(\\varepsilon,\\mathbf{p})\\label{eqn : dyson}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the self - energy is computed as follows , @xmath78    notice the non - perturbative feature of this approach is reflected in the fact that the complete fermion propagator is used in the right - hand side of equation ( [ eqn : sfenergyconsistent ] ) . after substituting equation ( [ eqn : gfull ] ) into the ds equation",
    ", one can derive four self - consistently coupled equations of @xmath74 and @xmath37 .",
    "generically , the equations of @xmath74 can be expanded in the form : @xmath79 . to the leading order of @xmath16 expansion , we assume that @xmath80 and ignore all higher order corrections . to the leading order , the gap equation is given by @xmath81 if this equation has only vanishing solution , @xmath82 , then the nematic fluctuation can not open any gap .",
    "a fermion gap is dynamically generated once this equation develops a nontrivial solution , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "in contrast , if the free fermion propagator @xmath84 is substituted into equation ( [ eqn : sfenergyconsistent ] ) , one would obtain the usual perturbative results of the fermion self - energy .",
    "in such case , no dynamical fermion gap can be generated even after including higher order corrections , i.e. , @xmath85 .     and fermion flavor @xmath1 at nematic qcp , @xmath86 ; ( b ) dependence of @xmath87 on tuning parameter @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "dynamical gap is destroyed once @xmath88 exceeds certain critical value @xmath90.,width=384 ]    we now attempt to solve the complicated nonlinear equation ( [ eqn : gapeqa ] ) . due to the anisotropic nature of nematic fluctuation ,",
    "the integrations over @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 have to be performed separately , which greatly increases the difficulty of numerical computations .",
    "for simplicity , here we consider the isotropic limit , @xmath94 . in this case ,",
    "the dynamical gap becomes @xmath95 , and the polarization is simplified to @xmath96    we first consider the nematic qcp and take @xmath97 .",
    "in this special case , the pre - factor @xmath98 on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eqn : gapeqa ] ) cancels exactly the factor @xmath98 appearing in the polarization function , @xmath99 , so the gap equation becomes @xmath100 this gap equation is independent of @xmath59 , and the critical point of dynamical gap generation is therefore solely determined by the flavor @xmath1 .",
    "after numerical computations , we find a critical fermion flavor @xmath101 at @xmath86 .",
    "the nodal qps remain gapless , @xmath102 , when @xmath103 , but acquire a nonzero dynamical gap , @xmath83 when @xmath104 .",
    "figure [ fig : ga0nr](a ) presents the dependence of the static gap @xmath105 on flavor @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear that the dynamical gap decreases very rapidly as flavor @xmath1 grows , and vanishes continuously as @xmath106 .",
    "it is also interesting to examine how the tuning parameter @xmath88 of nematic transition affects the dynamical gap generation .",
    "actually , if we move away from the nematic qcp , @xmath88 becomes finite and the nematic fluctuation is no longer critical . for @xmath107 , the coupling parameter @xmath59 can not be exactly canceled , but one can absorb it into @xmath88 by taking @xmath108 .",
    "we find that the dynamical gap is significantly suppressed by growing @xmath88 , and completely destroyed once @xmath88 exceeds certain critical value @xmath90 , which is shown in figure [ fig : ga0nr](b ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the dynamical gap generation is mediated by the critical fluctuation of nematic order parameter , and exists only in the vicinity of the nematic qcp .",
    "the dynamically generated gap for gapless nodal qps can result in a series of nontrivial physical consequences . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the physical implications of the dynamical gap .",
    "once a nonzero dynamical gap @xmath37 is generated for the originally gapless nodal qps , there will be an extra term that should be added to the hamiltonian : @xmath109\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can immediately identify that such dynamically generated term corresponds to the formation of singlet cooper pairs between the gapless nodal qps excited from opposite nodes .",
    "we therefore have obtained a secondary , nematic - order driven , @xmath39-wave superconducting instability on top of the pure @xmath13 superconductivity .",
    "as already pointed out , this dynamical gap is opened only when @xmath88 is zero or very small , and is rapidly destroyed as @xmath88 increases , which implies that the secondary @xmath39-wave superconductivity is achieved only in the close vicinity of nematic qcp . upon approaching the nematic qcp , there is a zero - temperature phase transition from a pure @xmath13 superconducting state to a fully gapped @xmath110 superconducting state . at finite temperature ,",
    "@xmath111 , the critical nematic fluctuation is weakened strongly due to the thermal screening effects , hence the dynamical nodal gap can not survive at high temperatures . according to these analysis",
    ", we now can infer that a small @xmath40 superconducting dome emerges around the nematic qcp , which is schematically shown in figure [ fig : phase ] .",
    "it is interesting to notice that such nematic fluctuation - driven superconducting dome is analogous to that is formed on the border of an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point in the contexts of some heavy fermion compounds @xcite .",
    "we also notice that the non - perturbative effects of coupling between nodal qps and fluctuating order parameter has been investigated in a physically different context @xcite .",
    "denotes the nematic qcp .",
    "the shadowed region around @xmath112 represents the emergent fully - gapped @xmath40 superconducting dome within a much larger , pure @xmath13 superconducting dome.,width=393 ]    we next discuss the effects of nonzero dynamical gap on a number of quantities .",
    "first of all , we consider the classical potential between the nodal qps . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume a constant gap @xmath37 , which yields a new polarization @xmath113\\nonumber \\\\ \\fl & & + ( q_{1}\\leftrightarrow q_{2}).\\label{eqn : polarizationd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the low energy limit , it takes the simplified form @xmath114 using this simplified polarization , it is easy to obtain an effective potential @xmath115 between two massive fermions @xcite .",
    "this potential grows logarithmically as the distance @xmath116 is increasing , so the gapped fermions are weakly confined .",
    "such gap - induced fermion confinement is similar to that in a physically analogous theory of qed@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "when the nodal qps are massless , their velocities are renormalized by the nematic fluctuation and thus become strongly momentum - dependent , @xmath117 the expressions of the renormalized velocities @xmath118 are quite complicated and therefore not shown here , but can be easily found in refs .",
    "both @xmath119 and @xmath120 vanish as @xmath121 .",
    "however , @xmath120 vanishes much more rapidly than @xmath119 , leading to the so - called extreme velocity anisotropy @xcite , @xmath122 nevertheless , once a finite fermion gap @xmath37 is opened , there is no longer strong renormalization of velocities .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : vrg ] , the velocities @xmath123 are still @xmath124-dependent and decrease with decreasing @xmath124 at high energies , but saturate to finite values once @xmath124 is smaller than the scale set by @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the singular velocity renormalization and the extreme anisotropy are both prevented by fermion gap @xmath37 .",
    "the dynamical fermion gap has important impacts on a number of observable quantities .",
    "for example , the density of state of nodal qps is linear in energy , @xmath125 , when @xmath126 , but becomes @xmath127 when @xmath83 , which vanishes for @xmath128 .",
    "accordingly , the specific heat of nodal qps is strongly suppressed as @xmath129 in the low - temperature region of @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , the low temperature dc thermal conductivity at finite @xmath37 is known to have the form @xcite , @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the impurity scattering rate . in the massless limit , @xmath133 ,",
    "the thermal conductivity is a constant , @xmath134 , which is finite and impurity independent @xcite .",
    "in contrast , once a fermion gap is generated , the thermal conductivity is suppressed by the finite @xmath37 .     and velocity ratio @xmath135 . here ,",
    "@xmath123 and @xmath136 are bare values of the corresponding quantities .",
    "blue solid line : @xmath137 and @xmath82 ; red solid line : @xmath138 and @xmath82 ; blue dashed line : @xmath137 and @xmath139 ; red dashed line : @xmath138 and @xmath139 . , width=316 ]    finally , notice that the nematic state is indeed equivalent to a superconducting state with @xmath140 gap , which was pointed out in ref .",
    "therefore , in the vicinity of a quantum critical point between a pure @xmath13 superconducting state and a @xmath140 superconducting state , the singular fluctuation of @xmath141-wave order parameter can also lead to a fully gapped @xmath40 superconducting state , provided that the flavor @xmath1 of nodal qps is smaller than the corresponding critical value @xmath2 .",
    "in summary , we perform non - perturbative analysis within an effective field theory of the strong interaction between the critical nematic fluctuation and nodal qps in the context of _ d_-wave htscs .",
    "we propose that a dynamical gap may be generated for the originally gapless nodal qps in the vicinity of the nematic qcp .",
    "such gap generation is driven by the critical fluctuation of nematic order parameter and corresponds to an additional @xmath39-wave cooper pairing instability . in the vicinity of the nematic qcp",
    ", there will be an small emergent @xmath40 superconducting dome .",
    "we also discuss the physical implications of the dynamically generated gap , and show that such gap leads to weak confinement of nodal qps , saturation of velocity renormalization , and strong suppression of several observable quantities .    according to our results ,",
    "it turns out that the fermion flavor @xmath1 is a crucial parameter which determines the low - energy behaviors caused by the nematic order . a critical value @xmath2 is found to exist .",
    "when @xmath142 , the non - perturbative effects of nematic fluctuation is unimportant , so one can trust the results obtained by perturbative calculations , such as extreme anisotropy @xcite and other unusual properties @xcite . if @xmath104 , however , the non - perturbative effects become significant , and can drive an additional @xmath39-wave superconducting pairing between the originally gapless nodal qps .",
    "our leading - order calculations found that @xmath143 , which is larger than the physical flavor @xmath36 .",
    "it would be interesting to study how @xmath2 is quantitatively affected by high order corrections . in principle , it is straightforward to address this issue by coupling the equations of wave function renormalizations @xmath74 and vertex corrections to the gap equation . unfortunately , solving these coupled equations is a highly challenging task because the integrations over three components of momentum , @xmath144 , have to be performed separately due to the non - relativistic and spatially anisotropic feature of the present system .",
    "it is quite difficult to get reliable numerical solutions .",
    "we expect that large scale monte carlo simulations would be utilized to investigate this problem and help to determine the precise value of @xmath2 .    irrespective of whether our @xmath2 is precise or not , a general trend can be deduced from our results : the conventional perturbative @xmath16 expansion should be reliable for large @xmath1 , but it may fail to capture some fundamental features of strongly interacting model for small @xmath1 and non - perturbative analysis should be utilized instead .",
    "in addition , our prediction of a nematic order - induced @xmath145 superconducting dome is novel and would shed light on the investigation of nematic order in correlated electron systems .    in our present analysis ,",
    "we have considered only clean @xmath17-wave superconductors and ignored the disorder effects .",
    "the influence of various quenched disorders on the stability of nematic qcp was investigated in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "as shown in this paper @xcite , the strong coupling between critical nematic fluctuation and gapless nodal qps is actually not affected by weak random gauge potential and weak random mass @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "random chemical potential is able to destroy nematic qcp and thus can fundamentally change the whole picture .",
    "however , both these conclusions and the analytical methods used in ref .",
    "@xcite are valid only in the particular case that the non - perturbative effects of nematic fluctuation are unimportant and all the nodal qps are strictly gapless .",
    "once the non - perturbative effect becomes strong enough to generate a dynamical fermion gap , the influence of disorders might be quite different .",
    "generically , the dynamical gap generation and disorder scattering can affect each other @xcite , so they should be investigated self - consistently , as we have done in a physically similar context @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper , and would be addressed in the future . in any case , we believe the results presented in this paper are reliable in clean _ d_-wave superconductors and pointed out an interesting new possibility regarding the exotic effects of nematic order .",
