    "forest - fire models @xcite are simple archetypical examples of driven dissipative systems that exhibit intriguingly rich spatio - temporal structures @xcite .",
    "these models provide a simple paradigm for cooperative time - dependent phenomena , such as epidemics , oscillatory chemical reactions , electrical neuron activity , cardiac dynamics , and turbulence @xcite .",
    "as the name indicates , the forest - fire model ostensibly describes the time evolution of burning trees in a forest . in typical models of this genre ,",
    "trees are located at regular lattice sites and each can exist in one of three states : burnt , alive , or burning .",
    "the dynamics involves the following elements : ( i ) a burnt tree turns into a living tree at some specified rate ; ( ii ) a living tree can be ignited , either by a lightning strike or by fire spreading from a neighboring burning tree ; ( iii ) after a specified time interval a burning tree is consumed and the fire at this location is extinguished .    depending on which of these processes are operative , as well as their relative rates , different dynamical behaviors can arise , ranging from self - organized critical behavior with fires of all sizes occurring @xcite , to spiral fire - front wave propagation @xcite .",
    "while forest fire models have been extensively investigated , there is still uncertainty about their long - time properties even after extensive numerical simulations in many realizations of the model @xcite .",
    "this work is focused on a specific version of the forest - fire model which exhibits coarsening @xcite rather than self - organized criticality or complex fire front propagation .",
    "because of this phenomenological simplicity , we can apply the rate equations in a natural way to determine the evolution of the system .",
    "the model itself was first introduced by drossel @xcite .",
    "its crucial feature is that tree growth is deterministic ; a tree that has just burned remains dead for exactly one time unit and then a new tree reappears .",
    "this particular regrowth rule is the mechanism that gives rise to a coarsening mosaic of growing synchronized forests .",
    "this is a generic feature and does not require the tuning of model parameters to critical values .",
    "let us define a `` patch '' as a coherent region of the system that is either occupied by live trees or by burnt trees .",
    "this patch evolves by tree regrowth and by the burning of trees due to lightning strikes .",
    "the mechanism for coarsening is that adjacent patches must eventually synchronize , after which they evolve in phase @xcite .",
    "while neighboring patches begin their existence as distinct , eventually the burnt trees in one patch will regenerate while the adjacent patch is still forested .",
    "when this occurs , all the trees in these two patches become incorporated into an augmented patch which then evolves as a single unit .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the process was investigated numerically and the total number of patches @xmath9 was found to decay with time .",
    "however , more quantitative observations were not reported .",
    "we will show that @xmath10 and we will investigate the patch length distribution , both analytically and numerically . for our analytic study , we will employ the classical rate equation of aggregation kinetics @xcite .",
    "this approach is ideally suited to treat the coarsening behavior of the system under investigation .",
    "another important feature of our approach is that we treat the dynamics at a mesoscopic level in which the basic units are synchronized patches rather than individual trees . in the long - time limit",
    ", we will argue that the lifetime of such patches can be viewed as deterministic . by tracking only the merging events of adjacent patches we are able to investigate systems of effectively much larger size and to much longer times than that accessible by tree - based simulations .",
    "in addition to obtaining a power - law growth of the average patch length , our method yields clean results for the probability distribution of patch lengths . this distribution is found to obey scaling , with no memory of the initial state retained and with the asymptotes of the distribution in good agreement with rate equation predictions . while we focus on the particular case of one dimension , our approach should also apply in higher dimensions .    in the next section",
    ", we define the model and outline the effective mesoscopic picture for the evolution of patches . in sec .",
    "iii , a rate equation description for this evolution is presented and basic results about the patch length distribution are obtained .",
    "we explain our simulational approach and describe the results that follow in sec .",
    "our basic conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "the evolution of the system is governed by the competition between two fundamental time scales .",
    "suppose that each tree in the system may be struck by lightning at a rate @xmath11 .",
    "then a forest of length @xmath2 has a characteristic lifetime @xmath12 before one of its trees is struck by lightning .",
    "we assume that the time to burn the forest completely is much less than any other time scale in the problem , so that we view the burning of a forest as instantaneous .",
    "there is also the deterministic time interval @xmath13 between the instant that a forest burns down and the reappearance of trees in this burnt patch .",
    "we assume that this refractory time is the same for all trees , so that regrowth of trees in a single burnt patch occurs simultaneously . without loss of generality",
    ", we take this refractory time to be @xmath14 .    at early times , where @xmath15 , the stochastic nature of lightning events is important . however , as we shall soon show , patches naturally grow with time . thus @xmath13 eventually becomes much larger than @xmath16 and the fire dynamics becomes nearly deterministic in the long - time limit . to describe this late - stage dynamics ,",
    "we ignore individual trees and treat the system mesoscopically as a contiguous array of patches , each with length @xmath17 .",
    "each patch can either be forested or burnt .",
    "if two distinct but adjoining forested patches arise by the regrowth of one patch next to a forested patch , they immediately join to form a larger patch ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .    at long times , patches have a small lifetime and they are almost always in the burnt state . without loss of generality we initialize the system so that it is effectively in this long - time state . that is , at @xmath18 , we consider all patches to be burnt , and we define @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) to be the time at which the @xmath21 burnt patch first becomes a forest .",
    "consider now two adjacent patches , and let @xmath22 be the time difference between the appearance of forest @xmath23 and forest @xmath24 .",
    "after these two forests undergo one cycle of regrowth and subsequent burning , @xmath25 changes by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the lifetime of the @xmath21 forest .",
    "this shift in the difference of burning times continues until @xmath25 reaches either @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "when this occurs , the forests necessarily join and are subsequently synchronized ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .    since lightning strikes",
    "a forest of length @xmath17 at rate @xmath30 , the lifetime @xmath31 of each forest is a stochastic variable whose average value is @xmath32 . in the long time",
    "limit , these lifetimes become very small .",
    "therefore we may replace the sum of a large number of these lifetimes by the average lifetime times the number of cycles .",
    "thus for two adjacent patches @xmath23 and @xmath24 that satisfy @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the joining time @xmath35 is @xmath36    an analogous result holds when @xmath37 . from these joining times between adjacent patches , we conclude that the typical joining time scales with the average patch length as @xmath38 .",
    "thus in a time interval @xmath39 , a typical patch grows by an amount @xmath40 .",
    "consequently @xmath41 , and we obtain @xmath42    in previous forest - fire models that are driven by stochastic tree growth and by stochastic lightning strikes @xcite , the latter rate needs to be very small to ensure non - trivial dynamics . there is no need for such parameter tuning in the present model , as the magnitude of @xmath11 determines only the overall scaling of the typical forest length .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath43 henceforth .",
    "a natural approach to determine the evolution of the patch length distribution is the rate equations .",
    "let @xmath3 be the number density of patches of length @xmath2 at time @xmath44 , and let @xmath45 be the total number of patches of any length . in the rate equation description of these quantities ,",
    "we make the mean - field assumption that there are no correlations between adjacent patches . in a similar spirit",
    ", we also ignore the initial phase difference between two patches in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jt ] ) , so that the joining rate of two patches is simply proportional to @xmath46 . with these approximations",
    ", the patch length distribution evolves according to the rate equation @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the rate at which a patch of length @xmath49 joins with a patch of length @xmath50 .",
    "this rate equation is nearly identical in form to the corresponding equation for the kinetics of aggregation @xcite , except for the overall factor of @xmath51 .",
    "this difference arises because we consider a finite system and we track the number of forests of a given length rather than the corresponding probability .",
    "however , this factor can be absorbed into a rescaled time variable defined by @xmath52 to reduce eq .",
    "( [ smol ] ) to the standard form of the rate equation for aggregation .",
    "this can then be analyzed by well - established methods @xcite .",
    "while the rate equation with reaction rate @xmath48 has not been solved , basic features about the long - time solution can be inferred from a scaling approach . in general , the long - time behavior of the rate equations with homogeneous reaction rates that satisfy : ( i ) @xmath53 , and ( ii ) @xmath54 for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , have been generically classified according to whether @xmath57 , @xmath58 , or @xmath59 @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the asymptotic length distribution approaches a scaling form @xmath60 in which the average patch length grows algebraically with time , @xmath61 , when @xmath62 .",
    "however , the scaling function @xmath63 exhibits different behaviors in the three cases .",
    "the reaction rate for our forest - fire model , @xmath48 , is homogeneous with homogeneity exponent @xmath64 , while @xmath65 and thus @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the scaling theory prediction for the average patch length becomes @xmath67 .",
    "consequently , @xmath68 , and from eq .",
    "( [ newt ] ) , we recover @xmath69 , in agreement with the qualitative argument preceding eq .",
    "( [ ellt ] ) . according to the general classification scheme of van dongen and ernst @xcite , since @xmath65",
    ", the scaling function @xmath70 should vanish exponentially in the limits of small and large @xmath49 : @xmath71    for short patches , this result therefore predicts @xmath72 .",
    "this behavior can also be established directly from eq .",
    "( [ smol ] ) . when @xmath73 , the gain term in the rate equation can generally be ignored .",
    "additionally , in this limit the reaction rate @xmath74 simplifies to @xmath75 .",
    "hence the density of short patches satisfies @xmath76 , which indeed implies the above exponential decay .",
    "in our simulations , we start the system with a random array of patches of lengths @xmath77 . as discussed in sec .",
    "ii , it is asymptotically exact to replace the stochastic forest lifetime @xmath31 by its average value @xmath78 .",
    "the time for regrowth of a tree is always equal to one .",
    "thus the dynamical steps become deterministic and randomness enters only through the initial conditions .    for convenience , we assume that each patch is initially in the burned state . from these regrowth and burning processes , a simulation of forest fires should be based on the following steps :    1 .",
    "initialize the line with patches of random lengths @xmath17 and with random times @xmath19 , for @xmath79 at which the @xmath21 patch first turns into a forest .",
    "assign a lifetime @xmath80 to a forest of length @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   use eq .",
    "( [ eq : jt ] ) , compute the joining times @xmath35 for all neighboring pairs of patches . 3 .",
    "sort the list of joining times @xmath81 in ascending order .",
    "a standard sort algorithm @xcite requires a time of the order of @xmath82 for a set of @xmath83 elements .",
    "join the pair of patches @xmath84 with the minimal joining time and increment the time accordingly .",
    "recompute the joining times @xmath85 and @xmath86 of the patches adjacent to the newly - joined forest .",
    "decrement the total number of patches by 1 and return to step 3 .",
    "such an algorithm is perforce inefficient because of the re - sorting of joining times after each event .",
    "however , this step is typically unnecessary for two reasons .",
    "first we `` cache '' only a small subset of the joining times with @xmath35 less than a judiciously - chosen cutoff time @xmath87 and sort only this subset in step 3 .",
    "we need not consider joining times @xmath88 because these events in the far future will never be considered before the current list of joining times needs to be re - sorted .",
    "this restriction significantly reduces the time needed to sort the joining time list for large @xmath83 .",
    "second , it is unnecessary to re - sort this reduced joining time list after each joining event because only the two joining times @xmath85 and @xmath86 are modified .",
    "if these updated joining times are greater than the elements in the already - sorted list , there is no need for re - sorting .",
    "one can simply continue to use the joining times from the pre - sorted list to define joining events until one of the newly - created joining times becomes less than the next joining time in the pre - sorted list .",
    "only when such a mis - ordering occurs is it necessary to return to step 3 and re - sort the joining time list .",
    "these steps are completely analogous to those employed in ref .",
    "@xcite to simulate the kinetics of one - dimensional ballistic annihilation reactions efficiently .",
    "we initialize the system with @xmath89 patches whose lengths are randomly drawn from the distribution @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "this initial length should be viewed as much larger than the lattice spacing between individual trees .",
    "we are interested in the intermediate asymptotic regime , where the average patch length is growing systematically with time and before finite - size effects begin to play a role .",
    "[ fig : lav ] indicates that this intermediate asymptotic regime begins when @xmath92 .",
    "an important feature of the system at long times is that there is only a very short - range spatial correlation in the lengths of neighboring patches ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ) .",
    "in particular , the normalized correlation function @xmath93 , with @xmath94 , quickly approaches zero for @xmath95 .",
    "this provides empirical justification for the validity of the mean - field approximation of the rate equations .",
    "it is worth remarking that such lack of spatial correlations appear ubiquitously in many one - dimensional coarsening processes @xcite .",
    "we now examine the behavior of @xmath3 for representative values of @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n - scaled ] ) .",
    "the different sets exhibit data collapse according to the scaling ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "the large - length tail of this distribution appears to be consistent with a simple exponential decay .",
    "however , there is a very small but apparently systematic downward curvature to the data for which we do not have an explanation .",
    "the small - length tail decays extremely rapidly near the origin and there are essentially no patches with scaled length less than 0.2 .",
    "this is consistent with the essential singularity predicted by eq .",
    "( [ limits ] ) .",
    "again , it is worth remarking that in almost all coarsening processes that are controlled by an underlying diffusion process , the small - length tail of the patch - length distribution is a linear function .",
    "the one well - known example of an essential singularity in the small - size tail of a cluster distribution is the aggregation of brownian particles @xcite .",
    "we have developed a mesoscopic description for a forest - fire model with stochastic lightning strikes and deterministic tree growth .",
    "instead of treating the system at the level of single trees , the basic element in our description are patches of synchronized trees .",
    "each patch undergoes periodic cycles of burning and regrowth , and in the long - time limit , the lifetime of patches can be viewed as deterministic . whenever two adjoining patches are simultaneously in the forested state , the patches join and remain synchronized forever . the number of distinct patches decreases while their typical length grows continuously with time as in classical coarsening processes @xcite .",
    "this mesoscopic description is well - suited to a rate equation approach for the evolution of the patch - length distribution , as well as efficient simulations .",
    "numerically , we find that the average patch length grows linearly with time , while the number of patches correspondingly decreases as @xmath97 .",
    "the patch length distribution is sharply peaked , with an exponential large - length tail and an essential singularity in the small - length tail .",
    "these features are consistent with the rate equation predictions .",
    "even though the system has nearest - neighbor interactions only , there are essentially no spatial correlations in the lengths of neighboring patches .",
    "because of this lack of spatial correlation , we can anticipate that the rate equation predictions , which are based on no correlations between patch lengths , should provide an accurate account of the one - dimensional simulations .",
    "most aspects of our approach can be extended to higher spatial dimensions @xmath98 .",
    "a complicating factor in developing numerical simulations is that the number of neighbors for a given patch is variable . nevertheless , the same updating rule given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : jt ] ) will still apply , with patch length being replaced by patch volume . as a result",
    ", we expect that the average patch volume should grow linearly with time . under the assumption that patches remain compact , this would imply that the typical length scale of a growing patch would grow in time as @xmath99 .",
    "it is of course far from obvious that patches remain compact .",
    "understanding of the forest - fire model in higher dimensions appears to be an interesting challenge .",
    "finally , we want to stress that the seemingly innocent change of the tree growth rule from stochastic to deterministic drastically affects the dynamics .",
    "almost all earlier work focused on stochastic tree growth .",
    "according to the literature on such model , self - organized critical behavior should occur in the limit of infinitesimal rate of lightning .",
    "however , after considerable effort , the understanding of the scaling laws is still incomplete , and even their very existence has recently been questioned @xcite .",
    "in contrast , when the tree growth is deterministic , there is no need to tune the rate of lightning strikes to zero , and the model exhibits simple coarsening rather than complex time - dependent phenomena .",
    "it is of course possible that the higher - dimensional version of the model will offer some surprises .",
