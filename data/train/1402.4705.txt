    "complete samples of circumstellar disks in star - forming regions and accurate classifications of those disks represent a foundation for studies of star and planet formation .",
    "both the identification of circumstellar disks and their classification are most easily performed using mid - infrared ( ir ) continuum emission from warm circumstellar dust . because the atmosphere is bright and strongly absorbing at mid - ir wavelengths , space - based telescopes have provided the most sensitive data of this kind .",
    "the all - sky mid - ir images from the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) enabled the first detections of circumstellar disks in star - forming regions .",
    "the most thorough census of disks was performed in taurus because it is nearby ( @xmath4  pc ; @xcite ) and has a low enough stellar density that its members could be resolved by _ iras _ @xcite .",
    "subsequent mid - ir telescopes , such as the _ infrared space observatory _ @xcite and the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite , have offered progressively better sensitivity and resolution , enabling detections of disks at fainter levels and in more crowded fields . due to its modest field of view ( 5@xmath5 ) ,",
    "primarily observed more compact star - forming regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , although it was able to map a significant fraction of a few widely distributed populations such as taurus ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the latest mid - ir satellite , the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ; @xcite ) , has lower spatial resolution than but it covered the entire sky . as a result ,",
    "provides mid - ir photometry for the portions of large star - forming regions and associations that were not imaged by _",
    "spitzer_. for instance , data have been used to search for new disk - bearing stars in taurus @xcite and to classify disks among the known members of upper sco @xcite .",
    "because of the importance of taurus in studies of disks and because proper use of data requires great care , we have performed our own search for new members with disks in taurus , and have classified all the disks that we have detected around the known members . in this paper",
    "we begin by compiling photometry from 3 to 24 @xmath6 from both _ wise _ and for all known members of taurus ( section [ sec : photo ] ) . with these data ,",
    "we then measure mid - ir excesses ( section [ sec : excess ] ) and classify the evolutionary stages of the detected disks ( section [ sec : class ] ) .",
    "finally , we use photometry in conjunction with proper motions , color - magnitude diagrams , and follow up spectroscopy to identify new members of taurus ( section [ sec : search ] ) .",
    "to construct a census of the circumstellar disks in taurus , we begin by compiling a list of all known members of the region .",
    "we adopt the 352 members from @xcite , four additional stars that have good evidence of membership from previous studies ( section [ sec : newmembers ] ) , 32 members found in a subsequent survey by luhman ( in preparation ; 33 if gz tau a and b are counted separately ) , and 25 new members ( 26 if bs tau a and b are counted separately ) that we have confirmed with spectroscopy ( section [ sec : spectra ] ) .",
    "we also adopt as a member hd 285957 , which has a proper motion consistent with that of the taurus subgroup l1551 @xcite and exhibits evidence of youth in the form of li absorption @xcite .",
    "known multiple systems are treated as single sources in our census unless they are resolved by either or the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting catalog contains 414 sources and is presented in table [ tab : all ] .",
    "the spatial distribution of these members is illustrated in a map of the taurus dark clouds in figure [ fig : map ] .",

    "spitzer s _ infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) and the multiband imaging photometer for ( mips ; @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the four bands of irac ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m ) and the 24 @xmath0 m band of mips , which are denoted as [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] , [ 8.0 ] , and [ 24 ] , respectively .",
    "irac produced images with a field of view of @xmath7 and fwhm of @xmath8 for [ 3.6 ] to [ 8.0 ] .",
    "mips had a field of view of @xmath9 and a fwhm of @xmath10 for [ 24 ] .",
    "photometry from most images for most members of taurus has been measured by @xcite ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have measured photometry of the members that were not considered in @xcite and all known members appearing in images that have become publicly available since that study ( astronomical observation requests 26470912 , 26471168 26477056 , 26475264 , 26472704 , 26473216 , and 23272448 ) .",

    "we found that iras 04166 + 2706 and iras 04368 + 2557 are dominated by extended emission in @xmath11 and @xmath20 , which resulted in significant offsets in the coordinates in the catalog from the true positions .",
    "hbc 360 and hbc 361 comprise an @xmath1@xmath21 pair that is only partially resolved by _ wise_. one source near the midpoint of the pair is present in the all - sky catalog but the components have separate sources associated with them in the allwise source catalog .",
    "although iram 04191 + 1522 does not have a counterpart in the all - sky catalog , it is visible in the images and is present in the allwise source catalog . therefore , we adopt the data for hbc 360 , hbc 361 , and iram 04191 + 1522 from the latter .",
    "thirteen companions that were resolved by irac and hence have separate entries in our catalog of members were unresolved from their primaries in the images .",
    "we have taken additional steps to verify the reliability of the data in the same manner preformed by @xcite for upper sco . in summary , we omitted measurements of @xmath20 brighter than a magnitude of 6 because of their large systematic errors @xcite , visually examined all images for false detections , identified sources that may be contaminated by extended emission or the point - spread function ( psf ) of another star , and checked for sources whose positions differed significantly among the bands . during the inspection of the images , we noticed that l1521f - irs was detected in @xmath22 and @xmath12 but had a measurement in only @xmath12 in the all - sky catalog .",

    "the values of @xmath27 were converted to color excesses with the two reddening curves for high ( @xmath28 ) and low ( @xmath29 ) extinction from @xcite .",
    "we did not attempt to deredden the colors for the 47 sources that lack extinction estimates , such as protostars and edge - on disks ( see @xcite ) .",

    "photometry in [ 4.5 ] and @xmath20 is available for 366 and 360 members of taurus , respectively .",

    "gm aur shows excess in [ 4.5 ] and other bands but is slightly below our boundary in @xmath20 .",
    "we indicate the presence of excess in @xmath20 for this star in table [ tab : all ] . for all other sources with excesses in [ 4.5 ] and @xmath20 , excess emission",
    "is also detected at longer wavelengths .",
    "photometry at [ 8.0 ] has been measured for 369 members of taurus .",
    "stars that lack [ 8.0 ] were either saturated or not observed by irac . since excess emission from disks increases at longer wavelength , the gap between the diskless and disk - bearing members is larger for @xmath32 $ ] than it was for @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 , as shown in figure [ fig : kvsp ] .",
    "we define our threshold for excess by connecting the points ( b0 , 0.19 ) , ( k2 , 0.32 ) , ( m0 , 0.45 ) , ( m8.5 , 1.01 ) , and ( l0 , 2.2 ) . as done in the previous section , we use 2mass j04215450 + 2652315 to guide the l0 boundary . all objects that have excesses at [ 8.0 ] also exhibit excess emission at longer wavelengths when such data are available . one star , v410 x - ray 7 , has no excess at @xmath20 or [ 4.5 ] , a slight excess at [ 8.0 ] and is unresolved from a nearby bright star at [ 24 ] .",

    "data in at least one of these two bands is available for 308 members of taurus .",
    "because advanced stages of disk evolution ( e.g. , debris disks ; see section [ sec : class ] ) can have arbitrarily small excesses at 24 @xmath0 m and no excesses at shorter wavelengths , we have selected a boundary that attempts to identify the smallest excesses that appear to be significant .",
    "this boundary is defined as ( b0 , 0.11 ) , ( k6 , 0.56 ) , and ( m9 , 1.38 ) .",

    "seven of the 86 stars have early spectral types , and hence are bright , but they lack good limits on @xmath12 or [ 24 ] because they are unresolved from other stars , dominated by extended emission , or were not imaged by the more sensitive mips .",
    "for the 79 remaining stars , which have late types , the limits on [ 24 ] and @xmath12 do not place useful constraints on the presence of excess emission .",
    "although we did not analyze any bands at wavelengths longer than [ 24]/@xmath12 , we were able to perform two tests of our identifications of excesses .",
    "first , we compared the results between @xmath12 and [ 24 ] .",

    "hd 28929 also shows excess at @xmath12 and not at [ 24 ] . because the mips photometry is more accurate , we list these two stars as not having an excess in either band . for all other stars with data at both [ 24 ] and @xmath12 ,",
    "the detections of excesses agree between the two bands . as a second test of the excesses ,",
    "for the 13 stars with excess emission at [ 24]/@xmath12 and not at shorter wavelengths , we examined available @xmath37 m photometry from the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; @xcite ) on the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite . because the pacs images are not sensitive enough to detect the stellar photospheres of these stars , any detections indicate the presence of excess emission at @xmath37 m .",
