    "the relative difference between the fluence in the calculation and in the experiment is roughly two times which is attributed to deviations of the optical constants in the epitaxial film - substrate system , limitations in the determination of the laser focus on the sample surface in the vacuum chamber , and the employed simplifications in the model .",

    "( i ) for films @xmath153  nm the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 up to @xmath154 200  fs is comparable to later times , but with opposite sign ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] ) . to explain this by a time dependent change of optical constants , a change in sign at a remaining absolute value would be required .",
    "this is rather unlikely since such effects would decay monotonously with the hot electron distribution within @xmath155  ps @xcite .",
    "( ii ) with decreasing @xmath17 the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 at @xmath156 shrinks faster than for @xmath136 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] ) , while the hot electron distribution remains for all @xmath17 .",

    "[ fig : long ] , which is too long for state filling effects due to a hot electron distribution , considered previously @xcite .",
    "a magnetization profile @xmath92 , which is detected through the different @xmath105 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , can , however , remain for such a long time due to a spatial gradient in the lattice temperature .",
    "in fact , the gradient in the magnetization might persist even longer than it takes the lattice temperature to homogenize , as at longer timescales , when the excitation of the electronic system has already relaxed , changes in the magnetization due to changes in the lattice temperature are mediated by spin - lattice coupling , which is not included in the m3tm and has characteristic timescales of several ps to tens of ps .",
    "we showed that the different depth sensitivity of the magneto - optical kerr rotation and ellipticity can be used to identify spatial magnetization profiles on ultrafast time scales resulting from spin polarized transport or spin - flip scattering .",
    "we found that the laser - excited spin dynamics in co / cu(001 ) films are dominated by spin transport effects on times up to @xmath157  fs when the electronic system has not yet thermalized , and by spin - flip scattering of thermalized electrons subsequently .",
    "since the sensitivity function , which governs the depth sensitivity , is straight forward to calculate , the demonstrated method is readily applicable to further material systems . here ,",
    "analysis of metallic ferromagnets on an insulating substrate might provide a film substrate combination complementary to the metal - metal case discussed here .",
    "we note that for the here presented methodology it will be essential to determine the complex sensitivity function independently of other heterosystems by a full , thickness dependent analysis , because it is set by the film - substrate combination rather than by the film alone .",
    "moreover , an improved experimental interface sensitivity , which can be obtained by using non - linear optical techniques , promises direct access to the spin transfer dynamics across interfaces and might be rewarding in order to obtain deeper insight towards a full reconstruction of @xmath92 and a more quantitative understanding .",
