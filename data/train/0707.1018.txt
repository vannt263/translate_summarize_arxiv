    "we consider the klein - gordon equation in one dimension , with an attractive vector potential @xmath4 ( the time component of a 4-vector ) , and mass @xmath5 . in units",
    "in which @xmath6 the equation may be written  @xcite in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the energy , and , for bound states , @xmath9 barton  @xcite has recently presented a detailed study of ( [ eq1 ] ) by analytical methods in the case that @xmath10 is a non - singular coulomb - like potential with the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath13 is a positive cutoff parameter ( called @xmath14 by barton ) .",
    "we shall adopt the approximation for @xmath12 and the definition of the parameter @xmath15 given by @xmath16 barton s paper augments the classic work by loudon  @xcite on the corresponding nonrelativistic problem .",
    "there is an extensive literature related to this physical system which is reviewed and discussed in barton s paper .",
    "an interesting discussion was presented in an earlier paper by dombey  @xcite , who studied so - called hydrino states and the klein - gordon and dirac coulomb problems in three and two dimensions respectively .    since the potential @xmath4 is symmetric , the eigenfunctions of ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "can be taken to be even or odd .",
    "most of the energies are associated with a set of odd - even doublets , which are essentially balmer like and may be expressed  @xcite for small @xmath13 by the formula @xmath17 where @xmath18 and small-@xmath13 approximations for @xmath19 are given by @xmath20}.\\ ] ] the eigenvalues expressed by these analytical approximations of barton are are not difficult to verify numerically .",
    "however , the principal goal of the present paper is to determine , not the balmer - like energies , but the bottom of the spectrum of ( [ eq1 ] ) , that is to say , the energy of the ` anomalous ' even state . guided by the careful mathematical analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite which has exhibited the key spectral features generated by the potential ( [ eq2 ] ) , we have been able to devise a purely numerical search procedure which is then not limited to any particular design for the cutoff potential .",
    "we shall discuss this matter more fully in the next section .",
    "first we define the spectral parameters used by barton : we adopt these for the present paper so that our results will be immediately comparable . thus we define : @xmath21 the idea is this : the coupling @xmath12 is fixed ; we choose @xmath5 and the cutoff radius @xmath13 , and this determines @xmath22 ; the klein - gordon equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is now completely specified and is solved for @xmath8 for the chosen state ; finally @xmath23 is found from @xmath8 and eq.([eq4 ] ) . for any other potential , also having a single cutoff parameter @xmath13 ( and obeying the scaling law discussed below ) , we may continue to use the same definitions .",
    "we observe that @xmath24 these monotonicities mean that we can safely think of the pair @xmath25 as scaled images of the pair @xmath26 this observation is important since one of the interesting and inherent features of the problem we study is that the parametric curve @xmath27 , @xmath28 has two branches ; we have to be sure _ a priori _ that this property is not merely a consequence of the definitions of the parameters .",
    "another common feature exhibited by the klein - gordon equation , with either of the coulomb - like potentials discussed in this paper , is to do with scaling .",
    "if we replace @xmath29 by @xmath30 , @xmath31 re - write the equations , and then choose the scale @xmath32 , we can easily show that , for each fixed coupling @xmath33 the energy @xmath8 depends on the remaining parameters @xmath34 according to the scaling law @xmath35 in which @xmath36 may have more than one branch .",
    "a consequence of this law is that it is sufficient for the determination of the spectral function @xmath36 to consider the problem with @xmath5 fixed , say @xmath37 this reduction in complexity is particularly important for a numerical approach .",
    "thus , since @xmath38 is in any case constant , what we need to do essentially is to determine how @xmath8 depends on @xmath39 or , equivalently , how @xmath40 depends on @xmath41",
    "we use fundamental numerical methods to study the lowest even eigenstate of ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "we make an initial guess for @xmath8 in the range @xmath42 and ( for the even solution ) set @xmath43 and @xmath44 for discrete eigenvalues , the wave function must be normalizeable and , in particular , satisfy @xmath45 ( although @xmath46 need not be normalized ) .",
    "we then integrate numerically ( by using a runge - kutta method with local error @xmath47 ) from @xmath48 , with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "we follow the size of @xmath49 and count the nodes . experience with schrdinger and sturm - liouville",
    "eigenproblems indicates that , if @xmath8 is too small , then @xmath50 becomes large without exhibiting the requisite number of nodes ; meanwhile , if @xmath8 is too large , there are too many nodes .",
    "thus the energy bounds @xmath51 can be repeatedly and more narrowly re - chosen on the basis of the observed numerical behaviour of @xmath49 as @xmath29 increases .",
    "this simple logic works for the klein - gordon equation too , provided the energy sought is positive ; when the energy sought is negative , too many nodes indicates instead that @xmath8 is too small .",
    "this experimental observation allows us to find the lower branch of the @xmath23 curve . to be still more explicit on this point , for the upper branch",
    "we search in the patch @xmath52 and , for the lower branch in the patch @xmath53 and we use the appropriate relation between the node count and the size of @xmath8 mentioned above .",
    "we note in passing that the interesting details of the graph for points near to @xmath54 necessistated a distinct and possibly superior approach that is described below .",
    "our graphical results for the potential @xmath55 studied by barton are shown in figure  1 .",
    "for the potential @xmath0,width=12 ]    we confirm the special values @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( corresponding to barton s @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) satisfying @xmath60 in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath13 , this limit corresponds to the supercritical limit @xmath61 we find for the potential @xmath55 that @xmath62 and @xmath63 figure  1 shows the overall shape of the @xmath23 curve but , as barton found , a magnified patch near @xmath54 is needed to complete the presentation , and indeed to determine the minimum value @xmath64 of @xmath22 : we show this enlarged view in figure  2 .",
    "we note that barton writes @xmath65 , and also that @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath67 where @xmath68 the earlier search policy based on the sign of @xmath8 and described above was perfectly satisfactory for the large - scale features of the graph shown in figure  1 .",
    "however , in order to generate figure  2 , we were obliged to accepted the fact that @xmath13 is a function of @xmath8 ( and not _ vice versa _ ) , even when @xmath8 does not change sign .",
    "thus , for each point on the graph , we fixed @xmath8 in the patch @xmath69 and searched for the corresponding value of @xmath13 that would yield a wave function @xmath70 we found , for either sign of @xmath71 that the number of nodes increased with _ decreasing _",
    "@xmath13 ; we are only interested , of course , in zero nodes , but the computer program must ` know ' how to adjust @xmath13 on the basis of the values of @xmath49 for large @xmath72 at the end we converted to the @xmath25 pair .",
    "this approach , which is independent of the sign of @xmath8 , appears to be robust and indeed might well be used for the all the points on the graph .     for the potential @xmath0",
    "this graph shows the minimum value @xmath64.,width=12 ]    the shape of the graph of @xmath23 and the special values @xmath73 completely confirm the analytical approximations of barton  @xcite for this problem .",
    "we now consider an alternative @xmath74 to the cutoff potential given by @xmath75 the corresponding graphs of @xmath23 obtained by solving ( [ eq1 ] ) with this potential are shown in figs .",
    "( 3 )  and  ( 4 ) .     for the cut - off coulomb potential @xmath1   @xmath76 otherwise @xmath3,width=12 ]     for the cut - off coulomb potential @xmath1   @xmath76",
    "otherwise @xmath3 this graph shows the minimum value @xmath77.,width=12 ]    the corresponding special values are @xmath78 , @xmath79 and , from figure  4 , the minimum allowed value @xmath77 ( corresponding to @xmath80 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that all the results in this paper have been obtained directly from eq.([eq1 ] ) and are therefore completly independent of the formulation chosen by barton for the mathematical analysis appropriate to @xmath81 the confirmation is all the more significant because of this independence .",
    "since we obtain similar results for an alternative cutoff potential @xmath74 , the main features of the solution , discussed at length by barton , are likely to be independent of the particular form of the cutoff .",
    "this paper illustrates a constructive interplay between the analytic and numerical work : the complicated two - branch relationship between the energy @xmath8 and the cutoff radius @xmath13 was straightforward to follow numerically once it s general form had been found analytically for one example . without further mathematical work",
    "it is reasonably safe to assume that the key features represented by the curves @xmath23 are generic to one - parameter cutoff coulomb potentials satisfying the scaling rule @xmath82 in particular , no discrete spectrum would be expected in the potential limit @xmath83",
