    "the absence of a gunn - peterson trough in the majority of the observed absorption spectra towards high - redshift quasars suggests that the reionisation of intergalactic hydrogen was completed at a redshift @xmath8 ( see @xcite for a recent review ) and that it remained highly ionised ever since .",
    "current observational estimates of the ultra - violet ( uv ) luminosity density at redshifts @xmath9 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , on the other hand , may imply star formation rate ( sfr ) densities several times lower than the critical sfr density required to keep the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ionised ( but see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "taken at face value , these low sfr densities pose a severe challenge to commonly employed theoretical models in which the observed population of star - forming galaxies is the only source of ionising radiation in the high - redshift universe .",
    "there are , however , large uncertainties associated with both the observationally inferred ( see , e.g. , the comprehensive analysis of  @xcite ) and the critical sfr densities . the critical sfr density , @xmath10 here rescaled to match the most recent wmap estimate for the cosmic baryon density ( @xcite ) , has been derived by @xcite using an early version of the @xcite population synthesis code , assuming a salpeter initial stellar mass function ( imf ) and solar metallicity .",
    "it results from simply equating the spatially averaged rate at which ionising photons are emitted into the igm to the spatially averaged rate at which the intergalactic gas recombines .",
    "[ eq : criticalsfr ] is therefore incapable of addressing a number of potentially important physical effects .",
    "some ionising photons will , for instance , redshift below the ionisation threshold before ionising and some ionising photons will have been emitted longer than a recombination time ago upon impact with a neutral atom , so that equating instantaneous rates is not appropriate and one even may have to take source evolution into account .",
    "it is therefore important to keep in mind that eq .",
    "[ eq : criticalsfr ] is likely only accurate within factors of a few .",
    "the critical sfr is inversely proportional to the escape fraction @xmath11 , i.e. the fraction of ionising photons produced by star - forming galaxies that escape the interstellar medium ( ism ) to ionise the igm , and proportional to the average recombination rate in the igm .",
    "the latter is parametrised using the dimensionless clumping factor @xmath12 , where @xmath1 is the baryon density , @xmath13 is the mean baryon density of the universe and the brackets @xmath3 indicate spatial averaging over the gas constituting the recombining igm . under the assumption of a uniformly ionised igm ,",
    "the clumping factor expresses the spatially averaged number of recombinations occurring per unit time and unit volume in the ionised igm , relative to that in gas at the cosmic mean density @xmath13 .",
    "a larger escape fraction implies a smaller critical sfr density , as more photons are available to ionise the igm . on the other hand , a larger clumping factor implies a larger critical sfr density since more ionising photons are required to compensate for the increased number of recombinations .",
    "most observational studies that compare ( @xcite ) . ]",
    "the sfr density derived from estimates of the uv luminosity density at redshift @xmath6 to the critical sfr density assume an escape fraction @xmath14 and a clumping factor @xmath15 .",
    "while a variety of both observational and theoretical studies ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have ruled out larger escape fractions , the estimate for the clumping factor comes from a single cosmological simulation performed more than 10 years ago ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is on the basis of these values for the escape fraction and the clumping factor that the observed population of galaxies has been found to be incapable of keeping the intergalactic hydrogen ionised , forming massive stars at a rate which is up to an order of magnitude lower than required by eq .",
    "[ eq : criticalsfr ] .",
    "it has been pointed out that this discrepancy between the inferred and critical sfr densities could be resolved if the employed clumping factor were too high ( e.g.  @xcite ; see also the discussion in @xcite ) . indeed , in most ( but not all ) of the more recent theoretical theoretical studies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) significantly lower clumping factors were derived .",
    "on the other hand , it is sometimes emphasised that simulations underestimate the clumping factor , due to a lack of resolution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we perform a set of cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations that include radiative cooling and photo - ionisation by a uniform uv background in the optically thin limit to study the clumping factor of the igm .",
    "we focus on the effect of photo - ionisation heating on the evolution of the clumping factor .",
    "previous investigations of the impact of photo - heating on the reionisation of the igm have almost exclusively come to the conclusion that it acts as to provide a negative feedback .",
    "photo - heating boils the gas out of the potential wells of dark matter ( dm ) halos with virial temperatures @xmath16 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this inhibits the formation of stars in these low - mass halos and thus decreases the ionising emissivity , which makes it more difficult to reionise the universe .",
    "the same mechanism that reduces the number of ionising photons that are emitted into the igm does , however , also affect the evolution of the clumping factor ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that photo - heating significantly lowers the clumping factor and hence the average recombination rate in the igm .",
    "while photo - ionisation heating undoubtedly impedes the production of ionising photons , our results imply that it also makes it much easier to keep the igm ionised .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : simulations ] we give a detailed description of our set of simulations . in section  [ sec : results ] we use our simulations to compute the clumping factor of the igm . finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ]",
    ", we discuss our results and their implications for the value of the critical sfr density .",

    "in addition , they provided a prescription for extrapolating this fit to higher redshifts .",
    "here we compare the volume - weighted pdf obtained from our default simulation ( _ r9l6n256 _ ) at @xmath19 to their fit . because we find that their set of fitting parameters provides a somewhat poor description of this pdf",
