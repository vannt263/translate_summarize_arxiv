    "the valence of the yb ions in ybpd measured by @xmath4-edge x - ray absorption spectroscopy was actually fractional 2.8 + across all temperature ranges@xcite . in the fractional valence state , it shows magnetic ordering at @xmath51.9  k.@xcite magnetic ordering in the fractional valence state is not very common , and we were therefore interested in studying the origin of this rare phenomenon .",
    "mssbauer measurements below 4.2  k show two kinds of yb , one magnetic and the other non - magnetic , coexisting in equal proportions.@xcite there are five phase transitions , at @xmath6=125  k , @xmath7=105  k , @xmath51.9  k , @xmath80.6  k and @xmath90.3  k.@xcite while the low temperature transitions below 2  k are known to be magnetic transitions , the other two transitions have not yet been explained .",
    "the high temperature transitions are accompanied by strong anomalies in the material s specific heat , thermal expansion@xcite and elastic constants@xcite .",
    "although these observations collectively suggest that either @xmath6 or @xmath7 is the charge ordering temperature , no superstructure has been reported to date .",
    "charge ordering can be studied by ordinary x - ray diffraction because of the difference in the ionic radius of yb@xmath2 and yb@xmath3 , which produces a pd displacement in the charge ordering phase .",

    "the peak position , i.e. , the incommensurability @xmath60 , changes from 0.07 in the mt phase to 0 with the phase transition at @xmath7 .",

    "there are two possible interpretations of the intensity distribution in the mt phase : stripe and checkerboard structures .",
    "while we have no decisive data to distinguish the two structures , the stripe model is the more plausible of the two . in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ( a ) , there are some differences in the intensities of the four peaks .",
    "the intensity at @xmath69 is equal to that at @xmath70 , and the intensity at @xmath71 is equal to that at @xmath72 .",
    "however , the former pair is apparently stronger than the latter pair .",
    "this difference is accounted for by the domain ratio in the stripe model , while the checkerboard model can not account for this intensity difference .",
    "next , we examine the origins of the incommensurate structure based on the stripe model .",
    "the valence states of the ions can be treated as ising pseudospins .",
    "it has long been known that an ising spin with a ferro - coupling for the nearest neighbor ( @xmath73 ) and an antiferro - coupling for the second neighbor ( @xmath74 ) , i.e. , the axial next - nearest neighbor ising ( annni ) model , results in an intricate phase diagram that involves wide incommensurate regions and commensurate regions separated by the first order phase transitions.@xcite the annni model has been applied to @xmath10 electron magnets including cesb@xcite , cebi@xcite and upd@xmath75si@xmath75@xcite , to ferroelectrics such as nano@xmath75@xcite and [ n(ch@xmath76)@xmath77@xmath75@xmath78cl@xmath79@xcite , and to charge ordering systems such as nav@xmath75o@xmath80@xcite and euptp@xcite . among these materials , euptp has significant similarities to ybpd , because both are metallic valence fluctuation compounds .",
    "let us compare the known properties of the charge ordering in ybpd with those expected from the annni model .",
    "first , the characteristic modulation vector varies from ( 0.07 , 0.07 , 0 ) at @xmath6 to ( 0.06 , 0.06 , 0 ) at @xmath7 . according to ref .",
    ", the wavelength is stabilized in a narrow temperature range with @xmath81 .",
    "when the temperature decreases , the calculation then predicts a first order phase transition to a ferroic arrangement within the @xmath31-plane , which was observed in our experiments at @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio @xmath82 is controlled by the application of pressure.@xcite as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:006](b ) , the lt phase vanishes around 2  gpa , whereas the mt phase remains above that pressure level .",
    "when we simply map the annni phase diagram to the ybpd temperature - pressure phase diagram , then the charge order characterized by the wavevector ( @xmath83 ) , which corresponds to @xmath84 in - plane periodicity , is expected for the ground state under pressures of more than 2  gpa .",
    "it is also expected that a large number of phase transitions will occur in the mt phase .",
    "we can test the applicability of the annni model to ybpd by performing further diffraction measurements in high pressure environments .",
    "another common origin of the long wavelength modulation is fermi surface nesting .",
    "however , the nesting vector can vary only moderately .",
    "the cell volume change at @xmath7 is almost the same as that within the mt phase , which means that the change in the fermi wavevector at @xmath7 should be at a similar level to the change within the mt phase . as shown in the temperature dependence of the incommensurability @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : map](c ) ) , the jump in @xmath60 at @xmath7 is far greater than its shift in the mt phase .",
    "therefore , the long wavelength modulation is unlikely to be caused by nesting of the fermi surface .    finally , we discuss the effects of the charge ordering on the magnetic and conductive properties of the material .",
    "the application of pressure makes the lt phase unstable , and the ground state charge ordering structure is changed from an @xmath85 structure to an @xmath86 structure ( the mt structure ) above 2  gpa . in accordance with this transition , @xmath87 vanishes.@xcite therefore , the magnetic ordering at @xmath87 requires a charge ordered structure in the lt phase .",
    "the charge ordering characterized by @xmath85 makes yb@xmath3 and yb@xmath88 sublattices , which can have different kondo temperatures .",
    "the yb@xmath3 sublattice can form a magnetic order because it is not in the mixed valence state . in the @xmath89 structure in which the sinusoidal charge modulation develops",
    ", the yb@xmath3 content is small , and therefore the magnetic ordering is suppressed .",
    "in general , charge ordering makes the carrier density decrease , and therefore the resistivity increases , as reported in yb@xmath79as@xmath76@xcite and in many charge ordered 3@xmath90 electron systems.@xcite in contrast , the resistivity of ybpd decreases when the charge ordering occurs .",
    "this feature originates from the good metallic nature of ybpd .",
    "the carrier density is nearly unchanged by the charge ordering because the average valence remains constant , while the randomness of the valence arrangement , which scatters the carriers , is suppressed by the charge ordering .",
    "we have performed a series of x - ray diffraction measurements on the valence fluctuating compound ybpd .",
    "the material shows two - fold charge ordering characterized by the wavevector @xmath27 below 105  k. between 105  k and 130  k , the charge ordering structure is modulated , and the characteristic wavevector is @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "we propose that this long wavelength structure can be described by using the annni model .",
