    "<S> we study ground - state properties and the low - lying excitations of heisenberg spin ladders composed of two ferrimagnetic chains with alternating site spins @xmath0 by using the bosonic dyson - maleev formalism and lanczos numerical techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the emphasis is on properties of the ferrimagnetic phase which is stable for antiferromagnetic interchain couplings @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> there are two basic implications of the underlying lattice structure : ( i ) the spin - wave excitations form folded acoustic and optical branches in the extended brillouin zone and ( ii ) the ground state parameters ( such as the on - site magnetizations and spin - stiffness constant ) show a crossover behavior in the weak - coupling region @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the above peculiarities of the ladder ferrimagnetic state are studied up to second order in the quasiparticle interaction and by a numerical diagonalization of ladders containing up to @xmath3 rungs . </S>",
    "<S> the presented results for the ground - state parameters and the excitation spectrum can be used in studies on the low - temperature thermodynamics of ferrimagnetic ladders .    2 </S>"
