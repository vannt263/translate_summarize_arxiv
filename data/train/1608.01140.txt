    "we introduce the concept of quasiconformal maps , a generalization of conformal maps , and the related properties .",
    "a map @xmath13 is said to be _",

    "specifically , a map is with good conformality on the face if the three angle differences are all close to 0 , or equivalently , if the mean of the absolute angle differences is close to 0 .",

    "for instance , under the shear mapping @xmath50 , the three angle differences are highly different from each other and none of them can accurately represent the quasiconformality or the level of the distortion .",
    "hence , instead of the angles , it is desirable to have the user - defined distortion defined on every triangular face of the input mesh .    in the following , we consider the _ dilation _ on every triangular face as a measurement of quasiconformality .",

    "since the beltrami coefficients are approximated on every triangular face as described in equation ( [ eqt : discretebc ] ) , it is natural to define the dilation on every face .",
    "we have the following discretization :    let @xmath63 be a quasiconformal map between two triangulated meshes @xmath64 on @xmath65 . for every triangular face @xmath66 of @xmath67 , the discrete dilation of @xmath19 on @xmath66 is defined by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the beltrami coefficient of @xmath19 approximated on @xmath66 .",

    "all other vertices are mapped to the interior of the region enclosed by @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . however , in the discrete case , if @xmath66 and its neighboring faces are not regular enough , some vertices may be mapped outside the euclidean triangle @xmath94 $ ] .",

    "next , we compose the map with a quasiconformal map @xmath96 that satisfies the prescribed dilation .    to compute a quasiconformal map using lbs @xcite , 3 point boundary constraints of the outermost triangular face @xmath66 are required .",
