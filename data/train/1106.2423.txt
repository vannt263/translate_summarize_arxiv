    "recent years have seen a growing interest in the application of the geometrical ideas originally developed for studying einstein s theory of general relativity to other areas of physics , such as condensed matter physics .",
    "the motivation is both the theoretical aim of developing the mathematical tools capable of dealing with as wide a range of physical problems as possible , and the desire to construct laboratory analogues of the exotic conditions which general relativity allows , but which are likely ever to remain inaccessible to direct experimental investigation .",
    "this in turn may provide a stimulus for further laboratory investigations , possibly resulting in the discovery of new physical effects .    in the present article we shall pursue this direction by demonstrating how the mathematical formalism of lie groups , which is of widespread use in general relativity and high energy physics @xcite , can be harnessed to study optical properties of symmetrical phases of matter .",
    "we develop a formalism allowing the symmetries of an electromagnetic medium to be directly exploited in solving maxwell s equations . when considering symmetries in classical mechanics , the discussion is simplified by passing to the lagrangian or hamiltonian picture .",
    "we present a formalism which similarly makes symmetries manifest for maxwell s equations . in order to motivate and illuminate the development of this formalism , we consider the example of light propagation in chiral nematic liquid crystals .",
    "we believe this to be the first application of lie group techniques to such a problem .",
    "the tools we develop , however , are more widely applicable to media with a continuous symmetry group . they may also be considered a generalisation of ` transformation optics ' , extending those ideas to allow for the possibility that the dielectric tensor and magnetic susceptibility differ .    we begin in section [ sec2 ] with a brief discussion of the helical ground state for a chiral nematic liquid crystal . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we introduce the geometry of the optical metric of joets and ribotta @xcite , describing the propagation of the extraordinary ray in a uniaxial birefringent material .",
    "in particular we study this metric and its geodesics for the helical ground state of a chiral nematic .",
    "the resulting metric is invariant under the simply transitive action of three - dimensional group of isometries which is locally isometric to the euclidean group @xmath2 of the plane , which we discuss in detail in section [ sec31 ] .",
    "in fact the isometry is the universal cover @xmath1 and the lie algebra is of type @xmath0 in bianchi s classification .",
    "we extend the discussion to @xmath3 in an appendix .",
    "the identification of the symmetry group for the chiral phase permits a fully geometrical discussion of electromagnetic phenomena , an approach we exploit .",
    "the high degree of symmetry allows us to solve the hamilton - jacobi and wave equations up to one quadrature in the former and up to solutions of mathieu s equation in the latter case .",
    "this opens up the possibility of a detailed analytic investigation of the type of caustics and optical singularities which should be observable in such systems @xcite .",
    "we then go beyond the geometric optics approximation to consider the full maxwell equations in section [ sec4 ] . for a uniaxial material whose director field takes on a helical configuration",
    "we show how the theory of lie groups leads to separation of variables for these equations .",
    "the resulting equations take the form of a generalised mathieu equation .",
    "this result is similar to others in the literature @xcite , but the derivation is fully motivated from the inherent symmetries of the problem .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we shall make use of the machinery of differential geometry , in particular tangent vectors , differential forms and the lie derivative .",
    "references @xcite provide readable accounts of these concepts .",
    "a nematic liquid crystal has an order parameter given by a _ director _ or direction field specified by a unit vector @xmath4 , defined up to a sign @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "a _ chiral _",
    "nematic has a built in twist , specified by a parameter @xmath7 , which can be realised as a _",
    "torsion _ , which alters the usual derivative operator acting on a vector by ^q_i n_j= _",
    "i n_j + q _ ijkn_k .",
    "the frank - oseen free energy functional in the one - constant approximation is equivalent , up to a boundary term , to : f [ ] = ( | ^q |^2 - ( -1 ) ) d^3 x , where we have added a lagrange multiplier field @xmath8 to enforce the constraint that @xmath9 .",
    "the free energy would be minimised if ^q_i n_j= 0 .",
    "[ bog ] however , as can be seen by taking another @xmath10 derivative and skew symmetrising , this is not possible over an extended region so the system is _ frustrated _ and must adopt some compromise configuration @xcite .",
    "one such configuration is the helical phase for which = ( pz ) + ( pz ) . for more details about the liquid crystals",
    "the reader may consult @xcite .",
    "for the helical phase , = 0,=-p , ^2 = -p^2 , this configuration is a stationary point of the free energy , satisfying the second order euler - lagrange equation resulting from extremising @xmath11 $ ] : -^2 + 2 q = ( -2q^2 ) .",
    "provided we choose = p^2 - 2 pq+2q^2 . among these solutions of the euler - lagrange equations ,",
    "the one minimising the free energy density has @xmath12 .",
    "the only non - vanishing components of @xmath13 are ^q _ 2n_3=qn_1^q_1 n_3=-q n_2 .",
    "it follows that the helical ground state is not a solution of the first order frustrated `` bogomolnyi equation '' ^q_i n_j= 0 .",
    "another means of relieving the frustration is the ` double twist ' structure , given in cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath14 by @xmath15 along the @xmath16 axis , this configuration has @xmath17 , so inside a sufficiently small cylinder , the free energy density is in fact _ lower _ than that for the helical phase .",
    "a structure composed of these tubes can fill space , but there will necessarily be defects where the tubes meet @xcite .",
    "such a configuration gives the so called ` blue phase ' . whether the blue or the helical phase is thermodynamically preferred depends on the energetic cost associated to accommodating the defects of the blue phase .",
    "if @xmath18 is the director , and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 is the unit tangent vector , then then the inverse speed or slowness of an extraordinary ray is is given by @xcite n= , where @xmath21 is the refractive index of the _ ordinary ray _ and @xmath22 that of the _ extra - ordinary ray_. fermat s principle reads n ds = 0 .",
    "thus the rays are geodesics of the _ joets - ribotta metric _",
    "o^2 = n_e^2 d ^2 + ( n_o^2 -n_e^2 ) ( .d ) ^2 .",
    "assuming the refractive indices are constants , we can write down the metric for the helical ground state given above @xmath23    as another example , consider a particular case where the director field , @xmath24 , is in a ` hedgehog ' configuration ( cf . @xcite ) and where in addition the refractive indices @xmath25 , vary with position inside the ball @xmath26 according to = r , n_e= 1 , n_o= 1 .",
    "[ hyp ] the resulting joets - ribotta metric is ds_o^2 = d ^2 1-r^2 + ( .d ) ^2 ( 1- r^2 ) ^2 .",
    "which one recognises as that of hyperbolic space @xmath27 in beltrami coordinates .",
    "remarkably , because hyperbolic space is projectively flat in these coordinates , the light rays are straight lines in this case .",
    "one could consider the 3-sphere @xmath28 , by changing the sign in front of @xmath29 .",
    "then one has a model related to maxwell s fish - eye lens by a coordinate transformation , but whose rays are straight lines . other examples may be found in @xcite .",
    "optical properties such as ( [ hyp ] ) my appear unnatural , but modern meta - materials are increasingly able to mimic such refractive indices , at least within a certain range of frequencies for the electromagnetic field .",
    "the aim of the present section is to obtain the isometry group of the apparently quite complicated metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "an enormous simplification results if we use the formalism of metrics on lie groups",
    ". we will start with a brief discussion , tailored to the euclidean group @xmath2 of isometries of the plane , consisting of translations and rotations in two dimensions .",
    "those familiar with the construction of left- and right - invariant forms on lie groups may wish to skip to the summary at the end of this subsection .",
    "we can realise elements of @xmath2 as matrices as follows .",
    "we first fix a number @xmath31 . to any point @xmath32 in the plane , we associate the column vector @xmath33 we first note that a general isometry of the plane can be decomposed into a clockwise rotation of angle @xmath34 about the origin , followed by a translation of @xmath35",
    ". we can write down a matrix @xmath36 depending on parameters @xmath37 which performs this operation as follows @xmath38 corresponding to any three numbers @xmath37 , we have a unique isometry and conversely each isometry corresponds to a unique @xmath37 , provided that we regard @xmath16 and @xmath39 as the same obtained by dropping the identification of the @xmath16 coordinate .",
    "this is a slightly technical point which we shall not labour . ] .",
    "we refer to @xmath37 as coordinates on the group @xmath2 .",
    "our aim is to construct a set of vector fields which are invariant under an action of the group @xmath2 .",
    "we ll consider for the moment a matrix lie group @xmath40 , i.e.  a group whose elements are @xmath41 matrices for some appropriate @xmath42 where the group action is by matrix multiplication .",
    "we note that any element @xmath43 of @xmath40 gives rise to two natural transformations on the group itself . acting on @xmath44 , a general element of @xmath40 , they give : @xmath45 and",
    "are known respectively as left and right translation , or the left and right action of @xmath43 .",
    "we note that the left action and the right action commute : @xmath46 now suppose that @xmath43 is infinitesimally close to the identity matrix , @xmath47 for an infinitesimal parameter @xmath48 .",
    "we have @xmath49 where the infinitesimal generator @xmath50 can be interpreted as a tangent vector to @xmath40 at the point @xmath44 , where we think of @xmath40 as a submanifold , i.e.  a surface - dimensions , merely that it is of lower dimension than the space in which it lives . ] in the space of all @xmath51 matrices .",
    "this is a _",
    "right - invariant _ vector field , since @xmath52 because of equation ( [ comact ] ) above . following a similar procedure , we find that the vector fields @xmath53 are _ left - invariant_.    in order to construct the left- and right - invariant vector fields of @xmath2",
    ", we must first find all suitable @xmath54 such that @xmath55 is an element of @xmath2 .",
    "we can do this by using the coordinate representation @xmath36 above . since @xmath56 , we can find the most general @xmath54 by taylor expanding @xmath36 for small @xmath37 .",
    "we find that the general @xmath54 is a linear combination of the matrices : @xmath57 we d like to express the vector fields in terms of the @xmath37 coordinates .",
    "to do this , we define a basis of vector fields for @xmath2 as follows @xmath58 we can either think of @xmath59 as a concrete matrix tangent to @xmath2 as a surface in the space of @xmath60 matrices , or more abstractly as the vector field which generates a shift from @xmath37 to @xmath61 in the coordinate space .",
    "this notation captures the fact that under a change of variables for the coordinate space , @xmath62 , the vector fields transform in the same way as differential operators following the chain rule . we can readily calculate the left invariant vector field corresponding to @xmath63 : @xmath64 in a similar way",
    ", we can find the rest of the left- and right - invariant vector fields , @xmath65 : @xmath66 now that we have the left- and right - invariant vector fields , we can construct the left- and right - invariant one - forms which are dual to them .",
    "taking @xmath67 to be the one - forms dual to @xmath68 , the left - invariant forms @xmath69 and right invariant forms @xmath70 are : @xmath71    the matrices @xmath72 have a natural commutator algebra , the lie algebra @xmath73 .",
    "this determines in a natural way the lie algebra of the vector fields @xmath74 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 & = & 0 , & \\qquad & \\bigl [ r_1 , r_2 \\bigr ] & = & 0,\\\\ \\bigl [ l_3 , l_1 \\bigr ] & = & + l_2 ,   & \\qquad&\\bigl [ r_3 , r_1 \\bigr ] & = & -r_2 , \\\\",

    "we can check the claimed invariance explicitly .",
    "first we note the matrix identity @xmath79 from which we deduce that the element @xmath80 acting by right translation takes @xmath37 to @xmath81 where x&= & x+p z -p z , + y&= & y+p z + p z , + z & = & z+ . making these substitutions into @xmath70 , treating @xmath82 as constants , we find dx + py dz&=&dx + py dz , + dy - px dz & = & dy - px dz , + p dz & = & p dz , so that the @xmath70 are indeed invariant under right translations . interchanging the roles of @xmath83 and @xmath84 in ( [ lraction ] ) we deduce that the element @xmath80 acting by left translation takes @xmath37 to @xmath81 where x&= & x p -y p + , + y&= & yp + x p + , + z & = & z+ . substituting into @xmath69 , again treating @xmath82 as constants",
    ", we can check that ( pz ) dx + ( pz ) dy&=&(pz ) dx + ( pz ) dy , + ( pz ) dy - ( pz ) dx&=&(pz ) dy - ( pz ) dx , + p dz & = & p dz , so the @xmath69 are invariant under left translations .",
    "armed with these invariant one - forms , we are now in a position to construct metrics which are invariant under an action of @xmath2 . for example , the flat metric can be written in terms of the left - invariant one - forms as : ds ^2 = p^-2 ( ^3 ) ^2 + ( ^1)^2 + ( ^2 ) ^2 , and is hence manifestly left - invariant .",
    "now for the helical ground state of the nematic liquid crystal , d = ^1 , thus the _ joets - ribotta metric _ of the helical phase may be written as ds ^2_o & = & n_e^2 ( p^-2 ( ^3 ) ^2 + ( ^1)^2 + ( ^2 ) ^2 ) + ( n_o^2-n_e^2 ) ( ^1 ) ^2 , + & = & n_o^2 ( ^1)^2 + n_e^2 ( ^2)^2 + ( ^3)^2 [ jr ] which is a left invariant metric on @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , any left invariant metric may be brought into this form by a global right action of @xmath2 .",
    "cartan s formula for a p - form reads _",
    "x = i_x d + d(i_x ) , and so the non - vanishing lie derivatives are _",

    "^2 & = & -^3 , + l _",
    "^1 & = & ^3 .",
    "thus while @xmath85 is an additional symmetry of the flat metric none of the @xmath74 are symmetries of the joets - ribotta metric .    to summarise then , @xmath86 may be considered as coordinates on @xmath1 , the universal cover of the two - dimensional euclidean group @xmath2 with @xmath87 left - invariant one - forms and @xmath74 left - invariant vector fields .",
    "if we were to identify the coordinate modulo @xmath88 , @xmath89 the group would be the @xmath42 -fold cover of the euclidean group @xmath2 , which corresponds to @xmath90 . with this identification ,",

    "the direction field @xmath96 arises as the image of the hopf fibration generated by the right action of @xmath97 and the joets - ribotta metric as the image of the berger - sphere . for the relevance of the hopf fibration to chiral nematics",

    "the motion of a rigid body moving in a homogeneous , incompressible , inviscid fluid @xcite is known to correspond to geodesic motion with respect to a left - invariant metric on the euclidean group @xcite .",
    "the present situation corresponds to a cylinder with its axis in a plane @xcite which may be reduced to the quadrantal pendulum .    to see this in detail note that the eikonal equation is ( l_3 w)^2 + ( l_2 w ) ^2 + ( l_1 w ) = ^2 , and it separates . if @xmath99 , then ( ) ^2 + ( k_x(pz ) + k_y ( pz ) ) ^2 + ( k_x(pz ) - k_y ( pz ) ) ^2 = ^2 .",

    "let us first consider ( [ zeq ] ) . introducing new constants @xmath109 and defining @xmath110 , we find @xmath111 which is the so - called _ quadrantal pendulum _",

    "this corresponds to the standard libratory motion of a pendulum .",
    "thus we find two behaviours for the rays .",
    "either the rays can penetrate in the @xmath16-direction or else they are trapped to move between two planes perpendicular to the @xmath16-axis .",
    "finally , we can consider the other equations of motion , ( [ xeq ] ) and ( [ yeq ] ) .",
    "we can interpret these as saying that the tangent vector of the ray oscillates around an average direction .",
    "for rays which are not bounded in @xmath16 , the result is a ` cork - screw ' curve , similar to a helix .",

    "figure [ geodfig ] shows some examples .      for an approximate description of light propagation beyond the ray approximation one may use the scalar wave equation .",
    "the scalar wave equation captures some of the wave aspects of light , whilst ignoring the complications relating to polarisation which arise in the full maxwell equations .",
    "we may expect the wave equation on the joets - ribotta metric to share some features with one of the two polarisations of the full maxwell equations .",

    "birefringent_. we see straight away that the condition on @xmath174 factors into two separate hamilton - jacobi equations associated to the two metrics @xmath184 these are both of the joets - ribotta form we have previously considered . it can be checked that the polarisation tensor associated to a solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation of @xmath185 has @xmath186 , whereas for a solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation of @xmath187 , the polarisation tensor has @xmath188 .",
    "note that we do not require that @xmath24 remains constant for this derivation , provided it varies slowly compared to the wavelength of the light . in the case that @xmath24 varies from point to point ,",
    "the polarisation will also change so that to leading order in @xmath112 , either the magnetic or electric field parallel to the director will vanish , depending on which type of ray we consider .",
    "often , one takes @xmath189 in which case , @xmath187 is simply the minkowski metric and its geodesics are the _ ordinary rays_. the rays of the metric @xmath185 are the _ extraordinary rays _ and @xmath185 is the joets - ribotta metric , where we identify @xmath190 and @xmath191 .    if @xmath152 is of the form ( [ standardc ] ) , but with no uniaxial assumption , then the rays will typically be geodesics of a finsler geometry .",
    "so far , we have re - cast familiar results into the notation of differential forms . whilst this is a satisfying exercise ,",
    "it is not clear that it introduces any benefits beyond putting the equations in a manifestly coordinate invariant form . for our purposes ,",
    "the great advantage is that this form of the equations permits a concise discussion of the symmetries of the system and allows the machinery lie groups to be brought to bear .",
    "we start by defining a killing vector @xmath192 to be a vector which satisfies @xmath193 recall that @xmath152 is simply a tensor , so the lie derivative is defined as a consequence of the differentiable structure of @xmath44 . making use of this and cartan s relation , we deduce that if a @xmath136-form @xmath134 obeys maxwell s equations : @xmath194 then so will @xmath195 and in particular , the diffeomorphism induced by @xmath192 will map solutions of the equations into solutions of the equations .",
    "an important example occurs when @xmath160 and @xmath192 is a killing vector of @xmath154 .",
    "suppose that we have a group which acts simply transitively on @xmath44 by left actions and which preserves the material configuration , as is the case for the @xmath196 symmetry of helical ground state of the nematic liquid crystal",
    ". then it must be that @xmath152 may be written in terms of the left invariant one - forms and their duals as : @xmath197 where @xmath198 are some _ constant _ coefficients . here",
    ", indices run over @xmath199 .",
    "we can make use of this to write down maxwell s equations for a nematic liquid crystal in its helical state .",
    "we take @xmath200 this choice of basis is very similar to the rotating basis chosen by peterson , who investigated the electromagnetic field propagating through a nematic liquid crystal in its ground state @xcite . in our case , this choice of basis arises naturally from the group structure of underlying symmetries .",
    "we assume further that @xmath201 where @xmath202 , @xmath125 have the uniaxial form we previously assumed ( [ biax ] ) .",
    "maxwell s equations for the electric and magnetic fields take the form @xmath203 the matrix @xmath204 has non - zero components p_11 = p_22 = 1 .",
    "these equations can be separated with the ansatz @xmath205 the components @xmath206 are given by a linear combination of other components , so that the maxwell equations reduce to a system of differential equations of the form : f(z ) + ( + _ 1 e^2",
    "i p z+ _ 2 e^-2",
    "i p z ) f(z ) = 0 .",
    "[ genmat ] here @xmath207 is a @xmath135-vector and @xmath208 are @xmath209 matrices , given by : @xmath210 and @xmath211 where we have introduced @xmath212 .",
    "we see that the euclidean symmetry of the original problem is still manifest since a rotation in the @xmath213@xmath103 plane sends @xmath214 , which is cancelled by a suitable shift in the @xmath16 coordinate .",
    "we may view ( [ genmat ] ) as a generalised mathieu equation .",
    "mathieu s equation itself may be written in this form with @xmath215 matrices . by floquet",
    "s theorem , the general solution of ( [ genmat ] ) will take the form : f(z ) = e^i _ 1 z h_1(z ) + e^i _ 2 z h_2(z ) + e^i _ 3 z h_3(z ) + e^i _ 4 z h_4(z ) where @xmath216 are @xmath135-vectors . making use of discrete symmetries of the equations",
    ", one may show that if @xmath125 is a floquet exponent , then so is @xmath217 and @xmath218 , implying relations amongst the @xmath219 .",
    "this equation may be studied using the infinite determinant techniques of hill , an approach similar to that of @xcite , but that takes us beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "we hope to address this issue in future work .",
    "since we have retained the independence of the magnetic susceptibility and the permittivity , this analysis applies equally well to magnetic materials with helical phases @xcite .",
    "we have shown that certain properties of the chiral phase of a nematics liquid crystal are intimately tied to the symmetries it possesses .",
    "we have shown that the joets - ribotta metric , which describes the propagation of extraordinary rays , is a left - invariant metric on @xmath220 and we have shown how the underlying symmetry group can be practically used to understand properties of waves in such a medium .    we have separated the hamilton - jacobi equation and the wave equation for this metric . the wave equation can be reduced to mathieu s equation and the hamilton - jacobi equation to the quadrantal pendulum equation .",
    "we have also seen how maxwell s equations for a general uniaxial material whose director field lies in a helical configuration can be reduced to coupled ordinary differential equations generalising mathieu s equation via a novel application of the theory of lie groups .",
    "this new formalism is applicable to the macroscopic maxwell equations whenever the medium has a continuous symmetry group .",
    "the approach taken generalises transformation optics to permit non - impedance matched media .",
    "as we have seen even in this simple example , the extraordinary light rays propagating through a liquid crystal explore a much richer geometry than the usual flat geometry of light rays in the vacuum .",
    "this opens up the possibility of constructing analogues for the propagation of light in a gravitational field . in this case",
    "the light rays in the liquid crystal may be mapped onto light rays propagating in a bianchi @xmath0 cosmology @xcite whose spatial sections have a fixed geometry , but one may imagine more ambitious possibilities .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the set up above generalises to the bianchi type @xmath3 group . for this section",
    "we set @xmath221 , in order not to clutter up the formulae .",

    "n_e^2 ( _ 1 ^ 2 + _ 2 ^ 2 + _ 3 ^2 ) = n^2_e ( dz ^2 + e^2hz ( dx ^2 + dy ^2 ) ) is in fact that of hyperbolic three space . in the upper half space or poincar patch space model .",
    "setting e^hz = , x= , y= it becomes ( dz^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 ) , and we see that optically we can think of a vertically stratified isotropic medium with cartesian coordinates @xmath222 and refractive index .",
    "rays are now circles orthogonal to the plane @xmath223 .",
    "the metric ds ^2_o= n_e^2 ( _ 1 ^ 2 + _ 2 ^ 2 + _ 3 ^2 ) + ( n_o^2-n_e^2 ) _ 1 ^ 2 may thought of as describing a vertical stratified anisotropic medium with extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices varying with height @xmath224 in the same way , i.e. as , .",
    "such a variation might be due to temperature variation within the material , for example .",
