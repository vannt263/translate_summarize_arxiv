    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) has become one of the most basic tools for the manipulation of matter at the atomic scale .",
    "although this experimental technique has reached maturity , the detailed theoretical understanding of experimental data is still incomplete and/or contradictory .",
    "one of the most famous examples of atomic manipulation is associated with the surface kondo effect observed when transition metal ions ( like co ) are placed on a metallic surface ( such as cu @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "the surface kondo effect is the basis for the observation of surprising phenomena like quantum mirages @xcite , and has attracted a lot of attention and interest in the last few years .",
    "early interpretations of these observations were based on the assumption that only surface states of cu @xmath0 are involved in the scattering of electron waves by the co adatoms @xcite .",
    "however , later experiments with co atoms on the cu ( 100 ) surface ( that does not have any surface state ) @xcite , or in cu ( 111 ) but close to atomic surface steps ( that affect the surface states ) @xcite have indicated that bulk rather than surface states are responsible for the kondo effect in these situations .",
    "the latter can be important for fine tuning of surface electronic structure , with potential applications to nanotechnology .",
    "a recent study of cocu@xmath1 clusters on cu ( 111 ) demonstrated this tunablilty by atomic manipulation and showed that each atom in the vicinity of the magnetic impurity matters for determining the kondo effect @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relevance of the kondo effect for the electronic structure of metal surfaces themselves was demonstrated by the discovery of a sharp density of states peak on the cr @xmath2 surface and its possible interpretation as an orbital kondo resonance @xcite .    at the same time , when calculating the kondo temperatures for real electronic structures a mapping onto one - orbital anderson impurity model @xcite was used .",
    "the realistic atomic geometry of kondo systems plays a crucial role in complex electronic properies @xcite and it is , a priori , not obvious that a one - orbital anderson impurity approach is sufficient : even the two - orbital anderson model demonstrates kondo physics essentially different from the single - orbital one @xcite .",
    "a recent theoretical investigation of fe impurities in gold and silver showed that the proper kondo model corresponds to a s=3/2 spin state@xcite .",
    "a realistic , multi - band consideration of correlation effects in specific solids is possible in the framework of the local density approximation + dynamical mean - field theory ( lda+dmft ) approach ( for review , see ref . ) .",
    "however , formally accurate quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations are always done with taking into account only the diagonal part of coulomb interaction @xcite , even with realistic hybridization functions obtained in the lda .",
    "this approximation is , strictly speaking , uncontrollable . at the same time , approximate schemes working with the complete coulomb interaction matrix , such as the perturbative scheme @xcite which is frequently used to calculate electronic structure of transition metals and alloys @xcite are not sufficient to reproduce so subtle correlation features like the kondo effect , properly . as for the exact diagonalization @xcite or numerical renormalization group @xcite methods they are hardly applicable , due to computational problems , for more than two orbitals per impurity .",
    "the recent progress in continuous time qmc scheme ( ct - qmc ) @xcite makes it perspective to treat the complicated kondo systems @xcite . here",
    "we will apply this method to calculate kondo temperatures as well as spectral functions for the case of a co impurity in bulk cu , in a cu @xmath0 surface and on top of a cu @xmath0 surface .",
    "in contrast with all previous calculations we will work with an accurate complete coulomb interaction @xmath3-matrix for correlated @xmath4 orbitals .",
    "the latter can be calculated from first principles in a parameter - free way by the gw technique @xcite so this approach is completely _",
    "ab initio_. moreover , the ct - qmc method allows to work , without any essential difficulties , even with the rigorous frequency - dependent @xmath3-matrix . as the first step , we present calculations for the static @xmath3-matrix , but this restriction is purely technical and can be relatively easily removed in the future , with a growth of available computer resources .",
    "the multi - orbital impurity problem with a general @xmath3-matrix is described by the effective action @xmath5 where @xmath6 are orbital indices , and @xmath7 are spin indices , @xmath8 is the local non - interacting green function for correlated orbitals obtained from the density functional theory ( dft ) with the help of optimal projection operator to the impurity d - states : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the energy spectrum and @xmath11 is the corresponding wave function of our system ( metal host with magnetic impurity ) , described by @xmath12 localized orbitals , and @xmath13 is the coulomb interaction matrix element : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is local orthogonal wave function for correlated orbitals and  @xmath16 is screened spin - independent coulomb interaction between electrons at the coordinates @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we used standard quasiatomic lda+u parametrization of coulomb matrix for d - electron via effective slater integarls or average coulomb parameter u and exchange parameter j as described in ref .. we choose the orbital basis related to spherical harmonics to be sure that magnetic orbital quantum numbers in @xmath13 matrix are satisfied the following sum rule : @xmath19 . in this case",
    "we will get rid of so - called three - site terms like @xmath20 with @xmath21 which turns out to result in a strong sign problem in qmc calculations with real spherical harmonics .    following the general ct - qmc scheme @xcite we expand the partition function around the gaussian part of our multiorbital action eq.([sinit ] ) which gives the fermionic determinant over the non - interacting green functions with the rank @xmath22 :    @xmath23    in order to minimize the number of different interaction vertices we group different matrix elements of the multiorbital coulomb interactions which have a similar structure of fermionic operators .",
    "since the @xmath13 matrix elements are spin independent , one should look over all possible combinations of orbital and spin indices , to generate all terms for the interaction in the action eq.([sinit ] ) .",
    "some combinations can violate the pauli principle and should be removed .",
    "for ct - qmc algorithm it is useful to represent the interaction hamiltonian in the following form : @xmath24 .",
    "the interaction terms can be transformed to the desired form , depending on relations between spin and orbital indices :    \\(i ) if @xmath25 , we can just commute @xmath26 and @xmath27 and then @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "another combination of indices , that allows the same commutation , is the following : @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( the latter two are following from the pauli principle ) , and also @xmath32 .",
    "these terms we can transform to the following desirable representation :    @xmath33     ( ii ) in the case when @xmath29 and @xmath34  we can commute @xmath27 and @xmath35 , since in this case @xmath30 and @xmath31 due to the pauli principle :    @xmath36    after generating all this terms it is useful to collect and _ symmetrize _ all the terms with identical and equivalent ( i.e. @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) quantum numbers .    in order to reduce the fermionic sign problem we introduce additional parameters , @xmath39 , to optimize the splitting of the gaussian and interaction parts of the action eq.([sinit ] )    @xmath40    one can see , that the first item in ( [ s0 m ] ) on matsubara frequences corresponds to bare green s function @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hybridization matrix .",
    "the second term is just a constant which we can absorb to the new chemical potential @xmath43 .",
    "therefore we can rewrite the bare green function in the following matrix form : @xmath44 the optimal choice of parameters @xmath45 would lead to effective reduction of interaction terms in the action eq .",
    "( [ s0 m ] ) and therefore minimization of average perturbation order in eq . ( [ zexp ] ) .",
    "note that relation between @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be represented from eq .",
    "( [ s0 m ] ) in the following spin and orbital matrix form : @xmath48 here we used the fact that @xmath49 following from the definition of the coulomb matrix elements ( [ umat ] ) .",
    "we also need to minimize the fermionic sign problem which finally leads us to such expression for diagonal alpha parameters @xmath50 corresponding to to the following interaction fields @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath52 has to be found iteratively in order to get a proper occupation number of correlated electrons . in the case of half - filled one - band hubbard model",
    "@xmath53 leads to the correct chemical potential shift of the @xmath54 and average @xmath55 which corresponds to the hartree - fock substraction . for non - diagonal alpha s which correspond to the fields of general form @xmath56 , where @xmath21 and @xmath57 we find the following optimal condition : @xmath58    since we symmetrize the interaction @xmath3 matrix it is necessary to extend the definition of the @xmath59  matrix to keep all the terms in the interaction part of initial action ( the last item in eq .",
    "( [ s0 m ] ) ) .",
    "it can be done in the following way @xcite : for every @xmath13 field in @xmath60 of updates we deliver the @xmath39 parameters as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and in another @xmath60 as @xmath63 , @xmath64 for the case of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for non - diagonal fields ,",
    "i.e. @xmath21 and @xmath57 @xmath67 , @xmath68 , with @xmath60 probablility and @xmath69 , @xmath70 otherwise .",
    "it was found that the sign problem is eliminated in the case when @xmath71 and @xmath72 for occupancy @xmath73 per state and @xmath74 , @xmath75 otherwise .",
    "the optimal choice of @xmath76 parameter is few percent of @xmath77 to keep minimal average perturbation order .",
    "another problem is a proper choice of non - diagonal @xmath78 parameter .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath78 is proportional to acceptance probability of non - diagonal field in the case where corresponding bare green function @xmath79 .",
    "since these processes are unphysical , the natural choice is @xmath80 .",
    "but it leads to division by zero in the updating the inverse green function matrix @xcite . on the other hand increasing the @xmath78 parameter causes a sign problem .",
    "we find a reasonable choice of @xmath78 to be on the order of @xmath81 .",
    "moreover for some special cases like the atomic limit , where @xmath82 is constant , a small noise should be added to all the @xmath39 parameters to avoid numerical divergency .",
    "the co - cu system is treated as five - orbital impurity model representing @xmath83 electronic shell of the cobalt atom hybridized with a bath of a conduction cu electrons .",
    "the bath green function was obtained using the first - principle density - functional theory within the supercell approach . for co impurity atoms in the bulk as well as in / on the cu ( 111 )",
    "surface the bath green functions were obtained using the vienna - ab - initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) basis sets@xcite . the density functional calculation for cobalt impurity in the bulk was carried out using cocu@xmath84 supercell structure with lattice constant corresponding to pure copper .",
    "the surfaces were modelled by supercells of cu ( 111 ) slabs containing 5 cu layers with @xmath85 and @xmath86 lateral extension for co in and on the surface , respectively .",
    "the paw basis naturally provides the projectors @xmath87 required in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g0 ] ) . in using these paw projectors ,",
    "directly , we employ here the same representation of localized orbitals as used within the lda+u - scheme implemented in the vasp - code itself or as discussed in the context of lda+dmft in ref . .",
    "for the problem of a single co impurity in a bulk copper matrix the basis set of spherical harmonics @xmath88 is used . in this basis",
    "the interaction part of the hamiltonian contains only terms of the following form : diagonal density - density like @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and non - diagonal @xmath91 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the coulomb matrix for the @xmath4-electron shell in the basis of complex harmonics contains 45 non - equivalent diagonal terms .",
    "non - diagonal terms can be further classified to a spin - flips , where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and the most general four - orbitals interactions , where this condition is not fulfilled .",
    "notice , that pair - hopping terms ( @xmath92 , @xmath34 ) are restricted by symmetry in this basis . in description of @xmath4-electron shell we have to involve 20 non - equivalent spin - flips and 64 terms of the most general form .    to find the effects ,",
    "caused by non - diagonal terms , we used two different interaction hamiltonian .",
    "first , interaction with only diagonal terms was used . in this case",
    "there is no sign problem .",
    "then , the complete coulomb interaction matrix of the @xmath83-electron shell of the cobalt atom with 129 terms was included .",
