    "blazars are radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with relativistic jets pointing towards the earth @xcite . because of the doppler beaming effect , emission from a jet dominates the broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from radio to @xmath0-rays energies .",
    "the seds usually have two broad bumps in a @xmath6 diagram . while the low - energy bump usually peaks from infrared to x - ray energies , which are believed to be the synchrotron emission of non - thermal electrons , the high - energy bump peaks from x - ray to @xmath0-ray bands , which is considered to be the inverse compton ( ic ) emission of the same electron population . for the ic emission",
    ", the seed photons can come from the low - energy synchrotron emission , broad line region ( blr ) , or dusty torus .",
    "because of the synchrotron self - absorption effect , blazars tend to have flat radio spectra with spectral index @xmath7 . as a subclass of blazars , flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) have strong optical emission lines ( equivalent width @xmath8 ) , comparing to bl lac objects that show no or very weak emission lines .    in the current third _ fermi _  large area telescope ( lat ) source catalog ( 3fgl ) , the dominant extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources are blazars @xcite .",
    "these blazars show violent variability , especially at high energy bands .",
    "the minimal variable timescale detected with _",
    "fermi_-lat has reached less than half an hour ( e.g. pks 1510 - 089 , ) and the variation amplitude can be two orders of magnitude ( e.g. , 3c 454.3 , @xcite ) .",
    "detailed studies of spectra and variabilities are essential for determining the location and mechanism of radiation from the jets of the blazars .",
    "the fsrq c50 ( also known as nrao 150 ) is one of the strongest radio and millimeter agn sources in the northern sky @xcite .",
    "the vlbi monitoring observations showed that the inner jet ( inner 0.5 mas from the core ) exhibits superluminal motions with apparent speed @xmath9 and a large , @xmath10 projected misalignment of the jet within the inner 0.5 mas to 1 mas from the core .",
    "these properties imply that a relativistic jet points toward the earth with a very small viewing angle . measured the redshift using near - ir spectroscopic data ( exhibiting strong h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 emission lines ) , and derived the cosmological redshift @xmath13 , which corresponds to the luminosity distance @xmath14 .",
    "they also predicted that c50 would be a high - luminosity @xmath0-ray emitter and one of the most powerful blazars .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of @xmath0-ray emission from c50 with lat on board the _ fermi _ satellite . using almost 20 months of data",
    ", he provided the @xmath0-ray flux above 100 mev , @xmath15 , and photon index @xmath16 .",
    "after the @xmath0-ray flaring activity around @xmath17mjd 56686 ( 2014 january 29 ) , _ swift _ target - of - opportunity observations were performed @xcite .    for the purpose of fully studying this high - energy source , we collected its _ fermi_-lat and available x - ray data , which include 15 _ swift _ observations and one _ nustar _ observation , and performed detailed analysis of the data . in this paper , we present the results from our analysis . in the following ,",

    "fermi_-lat data and provides the results .",
    "the _ swift _ and _ nustar _ observations and data - analysis results are presented in  3 and  4 respectively .",
    "we discuss the overall properties of the source in  5 . in  6 , we summarize our results .",
    "we used approximately seven - years _ fermi_-lat pass 8 data in this work , which are from mjd 54682 ( 2008 - 08 - 04 ) to mjd 57252 ( 2015 - 11 - 26 ) , with the energy range from 100 mev to 100 gev . during the time period , c50 was in an active state from mjd 56482 ( 2013 - 07 - 09 ) to the end of the data .",
    "the fermi science tools v10r0p5 package was used to analyze the data , with the p8r2_source_v6 instrument response functions ( irfs ) applied . to avoid contamination from @xmath0-rays reflected by the earth , we selected the events with zenith angles @xmath18 .    in the analysis , photons from a 20@xmath19 square region of interest ( roi ) centered at the position of c50 were selected , and binned into spatial pixels of 0.1@xmath20 .",
    "the first run of the analysis , using gtlike , was performed with the binned likelihood method to derive the sky map model .",
    "we modeled the events considering the components of the target and background .",
    "the background was composed of sources in the 3fgl catalog @xcite within the roi and diffuse components .",
    "the latter included the galactic diffuse model ( gll_iem_v06.fits ) and isotropic background ( iso_p8r2_source_v6_v06.txt ) .    to confirm the spatial association of @xmath0-ray emission with c50 , we calculated a @xmath21 test statistic ( ts ) map centered at its coordinates .",
    "a putative point source was assumed and moved through a grid of locations on the sky by maximizing @xmath22(likelihood ) at each grid point . in this step ,",
    "the target source that corresponds to c50 was unmodeled ( i.e. , removed from the model file ) .",
    "all parameters of point sources in the roi , except the diffuse components , were fixed at the 3fgl catalog values . to reduce the contamination due to the large point spread function ( psf ) at low energies , we only used photons above 1 gev for ts map calculation .",
    "the @xmath0-ray source was significantly detected , with a maximum ts value of @xmath23 .",
    "we derived the position of the source , and the best - fit position is ra = @xmath24 , decl .",
    "= @xmath25 ( j2000.0 ) with a positional uncertainty of @xmath26 .",
    "the derived position has an offset of 1.9@xmath27 from the radio position of c50 @xcite , consistent within 2@xmath28 error circle of the _ fermi _  position .",
    "no other known high - energy sources are within the error circle .",
    "since c50 was active from @xmath17mjd 56482 , showing @xmath0-ray flares , a 5-days binned light curve was derived using the binned likelihood method .",
    "normalizations of all point sources within 5@xmath29 from the target and sources with variable index @xmath30 72.44 were set free . for the purpose of studying the flaring variability in detail ,",
    "24- , 12- , and 6-hours binned light curves were also created . for these light curves ,",
    "an unbinned likelihood method was used due to the low statistics , and only the normalizations of variable sources were set free in the background model .",
    "figure  [ lc_phase ] shows the @xmath0-ray light curves of c50 in 0.1100 gev , with the upper panel covering the entire _ fermi _ observation time period ( binned with 30 days ) and the lower panel covering the @xmath0-ray active period starting from @xmath17mjd 54682 .",
    "six time intervals are defined based on the light curves ( see figure  [ lc_phase ] ) : p1 is the time period before the active state and p2p6 the time periods covering the active state , which lasts for more than two years .",
    "there are two distinct @xmath0-ray flares in the active state , p3 and p5 .",

    "two flaring events ( p3 and p5 ) are clearly seen in the 0.11 gev energy band ( figure  [ dif_lc ] ) .",
    "however in the @xmath31 gev energy light curve , the flares are not significant comparing to the rest part of the light curve , and the overall photon flux is an order of magnitude lower than that in the 0.11 gev energy band . in addition , we found eleven @xmath3210 gev photons during the active period , of which seven are within the time intervals of the flares ( see table  [ 10gev_photon ] and figure  [ dif_lc ] ) .",
    "we checked their probabilities of coming from c50 , using gtsrcprob .",
    "although the probabilities are generally not high , we note that the time length of p3 and p5 is only 10% of that from p2 to p6 , showing that the high - energy photons were likely related to the flares . in any case",

    "we have studied the @xmath0-ray and x - ray properties of the high redshift blazar c50 from analyzing the _ fermi_-lat , _ swift _ , and _ nustar",
    "the main results are summarized as the following .    * from _ fermi_-lat monitoring , the source was found to be in an active state since approximately mjd 56482 . during the state , the source s @xmath0-ray flux largely increased almost by one order of magnitude ( averaged on 5 days bin ) compared to the quiescent level . a correlation between the peak energy and spectral curvature ( and between the photon index and flux if a pl model is considered ) was seen .",
    "this correlation is the first time clearly detected in the @xmath0-ray spectra of a blazar .",
    "other important properties found are the several - hours variability and the possible detection of several @xmath33 gev photons .",
    "these properties have helped constrain the physical properties of the jet of the blazar . *",
    "the source showed flux variability in the _ swift _ and _ nustar _ data we have analyzed , but no obvious flux enhancement or spectral changes related to the @xmath0-ray active state were seen . as long as the data quality allows , we have found that a broken power law provided the best fit to the x - ray spectra , with an extremely hard spectrum ( @xmath34 ) below the break energy .",
    "this spectral feature is likely due to the low - energy cutoff in the energy distribution of the photon - emitting electron population .",
    "similar to that seen at @xmath0-rays , spectra possibly hardened when the source was brighter , suggesting that emission in the both energy bands was produced from the same electron population .",
    "* we have constructed the broad - band sed for c50 , though not simultaneous , and provided a model fit ( one - zone synchrotron plus inverse comptonization model ) to the sed . from modeling ,",
    "properties of the emission region were derived .",
    "we have found that the emission region should be outside the blr and the jet contained 42% of the eddington power during the active state .",
