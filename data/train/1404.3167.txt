    "the humber region is a large diverse industrial area in the uk .",
    "it is centred around the ports of grimsby , immingham and hull on the tidal estuary of the uk s largest river system .",
    "this port complex is one of the largest and busiest in europe .",
    "in fact the area surrounding the estuary contains 27% of the uk s oil refining capacity and infrastructure for 20% of national gas landing  @xcite .",
    "the wider region has many diverse industries from farming , to energy production , to heavy industries .",
    "many of these industries interact with one another , often via the material supply of goods or services .",
    "this can range from the unexceptional use of electricity by almost all industries ( in most instances procured from energy suppliers via the grid ) , to industry - specific needs such as biomass for co - firing power plants .",
    "these interactions form a complicated web representing the industrial economy of the humber region . as well as these physical , metabolic interactions there are also what we might call _ social _ interactions , both positive and negative . for instance",
    ", joint bidding for funding , competition for scarce , highly skilled workers , etc .",
    "we shall not dwell on such social interactions between firms in this paper , however we extend our methods to take into account their effect in  @xcite . instead we here seek to understand the metabolic interactions and how they influence the region as a whole .",
    "obviously such an intricate network of relationships is not unique to the humber region .",
    "in fact , any economy which has a regional component could be represented by a complicated set of interconnections between constituent industries .",
    "however not all industrial economies are as complicated as one another .",
    "for instance , consider local economies which are based around one major firm ( a hub and spoke district  @xcite ) .",
    "such economies are likely to have a relatively simple set of relationships between the industries present ; either supplying the major firm or buying and using its products . nor are intricate networks of relationships restricted to ` man made ' economies .",
    "consider , for instance natural ecosystems , and the complexity of various food webs made up of consumer - resource interactions  @xcite .",
    "unlike industrial districts , much research has been carried out on food webs and how to model them in a quantitative , whole system , manner .",
    "in contrast , modelling of industries tends to focus on the supply chains of individual firms  @xcite rather than modelling of all firms within an economic or geographic district .",
    "this means , for instance , that competition effects for resources are not completely included .",
    "that is , competition may be included if two firms supply a firm in the supply chain , but not if a competing firm does not supply ( in some way ) the firm that the supply chain is focussed on .",
    "this could have huge effects , for instance if a competing firm ( not in the supply chain ) went out of business , this might mean that a firm in the supply chain does nt have enough business and so also fails , having a knock - on impact on the whole supply chain .",
    "many of these models of supply chains are static , although some are dynamic , often using multi - agent approaches to simulate supply decisions  @xcite . due to the lack of whole system ( high level ) dynamical models for interdependencies of firms in an industrial district",
    "we draw inspiration from the field of ecological modelling .",
    "the archetype of whole system ecology models is the lotka - volterra model for predator prey interactions , originally developed by lotka in the 1920s ,  @xcite .",
    "this is a dynamical population - based model with the change in population of each individual species being represented by a differential equation .",
    "each equation contains terms relating to population growth , for instance birth rates , which could be related to the availability of food , and hence to the population of any prey species .",
    "each equation also contains a term representing the decrease in population due to death .",
    "this term may be dependent on the size of predator populations .",
    "the way that the growth and decay terms depend on the population sizes of other species couples all of the equations together , creating a simple model of the complete food web .",
    "variants of this basic lotka - volterra model have been applied to model many different food webs  @xcite , however , to our knowledge , no work has attempted to model the web of industrial firms in the same way . in this paper",
    "we seek to address this deficit by creating a lotka - volterra type model for the interaction of industries . instead of each equation modelling the size of a population of a particular species we instead create an equation for the ` size ' of each firm or industry . where ` size ' can be thought of as an abstract concept which in some way represents the health and wealth of a firm .",
    "the coupling of these equations is then via the ` size ' of supplier and customer firms rather than prey and predator populations .",
    "this dynamical model of the interactions of industries in a economic or geographic district will be quite high level and general without going into many of the specifics considered when modelling individual supply chains .",
    "the idea behind the model is not to give intricate detail about the system but rather represent it with a ` broad brush ' in order to make statements on the scale of the whole system , and how it might respond to changes .    in section  [ s : humberregion ] we apply this model to the industrial economy of the humber region to learn more about the implications of the interconnected structure of the metabolic connections between industry types .",
    "in particular we investigate how the region may transition from being centred around fossil fuels to become a bio - based economy .",
    "an industrial economy is made up of several different firms or industry types interacting in various ways , in a spatially confined region . as an initial attempt to model the dynamics of such a district of industrial types we shall only consider metabolic interactions , consisting of the trade in goods and services .",
    "further , we shall make the model as simple as possible so that modifications to include social interactions  @xcite may be made and the model remain amenable to analysis .",
    "this means , among other things that the model shall concern only one good ( locally ) , or equivalently make the assumption that all goods ( sold within the district ) are interchangeable . whilst this assumption is questionable in most instances",
    ", it hugely simplifies the modelling process and , more importantly , means that it is possible to find the data needed to initialise the model .",
    "it would be possible to make the model more complicated , however this would be at the expense of the model s usability .",
    "it must be remarked that the aim of the model is to express the general behaviour of the system as a whole , as such , the level of assumptions made is appropriate .    as no spatially confined industrial economy ( an industrial district )",
    "is entirely closed there will always be flows of materials and services into and out of the district .",
    "similarly unless we model on the scale of the individual there will be transactions between entities in the model and those which have not been modelled , for instance individual consumers . to account for this edge of the district we split the industry types into three categories signifying their relationship with what lies beyond the district .",
    "they are denoted ` _ _ primary suppliers _ _ ' ( * s * ) , ` _ _ intermediaries _ _ ' ( * i * ) and ` _ _ end consumers _ _ ' ( * c * ) .",
    "the distinction relates to the structural role of each firm , both the ` primary suppliers ' and the ` end consumers ' have some form of trade link with entities beyond those modelled in the local district .",
    "the rest of the firms are denoted as ` intermediaries ' .",
    "the ` primary suppliers ' are those firms who derive product from somewhere outside of the network . for instance , if a local network is considered then any firm which buys material from further afield is denoted as a ` primary supplier ' .",
    "alternatively a firm which mines for resources ( as long as the resource itself is not modelled ) is a ` primary supplier ' . `",
    "end consumers ' are those firms who sell product beyond the network , this can either be thought as global trade when considering a local network or as selling of product to individual customers ( people or small firms not included in the model ) .",
    "it is important to recognise that a ` primary supplier ' may also buy from other firms in the network .",
    "similarly ` end consumers ' may supply other nodes in the network .",
    "it is also possible for a firm ( or industry ) to be both a ` primary supplier ' and an ` end consumer ' , in this case the firm is called a _ hub _ of the network .",
    "figure  [ ntypes ] shows an example of a local metabolic network with labels denoting the type of each node .",
    "note that every node must be connected ( backward ) to at least one supplier and connected ( forward ) to at least one consumer ( a node with no outgoing connections to other nodes in the network is automatically an ` end consumer ' , and one with no incoming connections from other nodes in the network is automatically a ` primary supplier ' ) .",
    "with this distinction we can start formulating our model for the interactions of industries in a region .",
    "we shall start by considering the industries denoted ` intermediary ' , the equations for industries of the other two classes can be easily derived from them . each intermediary ( by definition ) will have suppliers and customers amongst the other firms ( industries ) that make up the model . for",
    "a specific firm denoted ` firm @xmath0 ' the set of firms which supply products or services to it is denoted @xmath1 , and the set of firms which buy products or services from firm @xmath0 is denoted @xmath2 . at its most basic",
    "our lotka - volterra type model says that each year a firm or industry grows by the amount it sells its products and services for , less the amount it spent buying the raw materials or services it needed , less overhead costs .",
    "however actually writing this basic model down proves to be fairly complicated .",
    "we denote the wealth / health / general utility of firm @xmath0 by @xmath3 , and the worth of the products or services sold to firm @xmath4 by @xmath5 .",
    "the worth of a product ( or service ) may be different to those selling it and those buying it .",
    "the firm which sells the product is unlikely to sell it at cost price , meaning that their idea of value must take into account the profit that they made in producing the product or offering the service .",
    "as our model only deals ( locally ) with one product any feedback loops may cause issues , leading to an exponential rise in the cost of goods as they circle round such a loop . to avoid this we assume that the value of the goods ( as perceived by the buyer ) is their actual material and production cost , whilst the value of the goods to the seller is the material and production cost of the product plus the profit they make on it .",
    "this has the effect of renormalising everything at each time step and is similar to inflation adjusting the costs for each firm .",
    "thus the cost to a firm @xmath0 s utility of buying from firm @xmath4 is @xmath6 and the gain to firm @xmath0 s utility of selling to firm @xmath4 is @xmath7 . where @xmath8 is the percentage profit that firm @xmath0 makes .",
    "finally , if we denote the percentage overhead costs of firm @xmath0 by @xmath9 then the basis of our model can be written : @xmath10    this equation forms the basis of our model , and is almost complete for intermediary firms . the one major component still to add is the effect on the utility if a firm is not able to buy all of the materials or services it requires .",
    "this could affect the amount of its own product a firm is able to sell , however this soon gets very complicated and would require the use of delay equations .",
    "instead we assume that the same amount of product ( or service ) is made but it costs more or is of lower quality .",
    "for instance , buying in the completed product from some external supplier at market rates to ensure the firm has enough product to sell in the short term . this would not change the worth of the product to the customer , but would certainly affect the worth to the supplier .",
    "we model this by imposing a multiplicative penalty term @xmath11 on the gain in utility given by the selling of product .",
    "this penalty is the actual supply of material and services over the total required supply .",
    "thus our model for the health / wealth of a firm becomes @xmath12    the details required to make a complete model are expressions for the value of product sold between firms ( @xmath5 ) and the multiplicative penalty term ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "there are different ways to do this , including full market modelling in the case of the amount of product sold between firms .",
    "however we shall again choose a simpler option .",
    "we shall assume that there is a fixed percentage of the utility that a firm requires in supplies , @xmath13 .",
    "that is @xmath14 is the total amount that firm @xmath0 must ` pay ' to buy all of the materials and services it needs when it has grown to size @xmath3 .",
    "similarly we assume that the value of the product each firm creates is proportional to its size @xmath3 .",
    "that is a firm with utility @xmath3 produces products with a value @xmath15 .",
    "a complete list of all the notation used in our model is given in table  [ notat ] .",
    "with this notation we can express the penalty term ( still for intermediary firms ) as @xmath16 the fraction of the required supply that a firm actually managed to procure .",
    "the expression we use for @xmath6 is more complicated as firm @xmath0 is likely to have multiple suppliers and each of them is likely to have multiple customers . if each firm that supplies firm @xmath0 can meet all demands for product placed upon them by all of their customers ( they re big enough ) then firm @xmath0 is able to buy the total amount of product it requires @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the amount it buys from each of its suppliers is proportional to their size ( utility ) .",
    "this expresses the desire to keep the largest of a firm s suppliers as happy as possible - without totally alienating any of the other suppliers .",
    "that is ( if all of a firm s suppliers are able to fulfil the entire demand for product placed upon them ) @xmath17    if on the other hand one of firm @xmath0 s suppliers ( firm @xmath4 say ) is unable to fulfil the total demand placed upon it then it will , in total , supply the maximum amount that it can : @xmath18",
    ". it will distribute this according to the demand placed on it by each of its customers .",
    "we again assume that it sells in proportion to the amount each customer requires ( see above ) , in order to retain the largest customers without alienating any of the smaller customers ( note in our model we do not actually allow the customers or suppliers of firms to change , although they can go out of business ) . that is @xmath19}.\\ ] ]",
    "combining these two scenarios together gives : @xmath20\\leq\\rho_i u_i,\\\\ \\rho_j u_j \\beta_i u_i \\frac{u_j}{\\sum_{k\\in s_i } u_k}\\frac{1}{\\sum_{l\\in c_j}\\left[\\beta_l u_l \\frac{u_j}{\\sum_{m\\in s_l } u_m}\\right ] } & , ~\\mbox{otherwise}. \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    this completes the details of the model for intermediary firms .",
    "we now explain the amendments needed to cope with the ` primary suppliers ' and ` end consumers ' .",
    "first of all note that if the current model were applied to an end consumer with no customers being modelled then there would be no growth term , @xmath3 would be monotonically decreasing . similarly looking at a primary supplier",
    "the only negative term would be the overheads , even though products were being bought and paid for ( just from outside the set of firms modelled ) . to counter this we add an extra term to the model containing the utility gain or loss from exporting or importing , respectively , materials and products from outside the set of firms modelled .",
    "we denote this component of the model @xmath21 .",
    "the value of which depends on the classification of the firm . if firm @xmath0 is an intermediary firm then @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the supply of a product from outside the district is essentially unlimited .",
    "that is , a firm which is a supplier can buy what ever it requires from outside of the district , @xmath14 .",
    "if a firm buys all of its supplies from outside the district then using this makes sense , however if it buys some of its supplies from inside the district it would end up buying supplies to the value of @xmath23 .",
    "if this is the case we make the value of @xmath13 half what it would otherwise be . whilst the choice of a half of the product being bought from within the district and half from outside of the firms modelled is fairly arbitrary , it is something which could easily be improved upon in later iterations of the model if such detailed data is available .",
    "when considering ` end consumers ' we make the assumption that the external market for the products and services being created is bounded .",
    "the total maximum demand of the external market is for products with value @xmath24 .",
    "if the total amount the district is trying to sell to the external market exceeds the market demand then each end consumer sells according to their size .",
    "in complicated industrial districts it is possible ( and indeed likely ) that the goods being sold to the external market are not interchangeable . to account for this",
    "we say that there are several external markets for different commodity types , each with a bound on the value of good which can be bought , @xmath25 .",
    "for instance it seems feasible that fuel could be treated as such a commodity type , with different fuel types competing in the external market due to their similarities .",
    "a further complication arises if a firm supplies multiple distinct external markets , for instance if firm @xmath0 is in @xmath26 . in this case",
    ", one must know what proportion of the amount sold by firm @xmath0 goes to market @xmath27 and how much to market @xmath28 .",
    "for simplicity we shall assume that firm @xmath0 wants to sell the same amount of goods in each external market ( if in reality the proportion of goods sold to one external market from firm @xmath0 is much smaller than that sold to other external markets then the sales to that market from firm @xmath0 could be ignored for the purpose of this model ) . in reality",
    "a firm with multiple markets may choose to reposition itself if one of those markets becomes unprofitable due to excess competition , however to model this we would need to model the decisions of individual firms , something we choose not to do in order to create a simple deterministic model of the interactions of firms .",
    "if there is just one external market then the amount ` end consumer ' @xmath0 sells to the external market is @xmath29 again if a firm is an ` end consumer ' but also sells to other firms in the district then we make @xmath30 half of what it would otherwise be .",
    "if firm @xmath0 is an ` end consumer ' its utility needs to increase by @xmath31 .",
    "that is we have @xmath32 however if there is more than one external market the expression for @xmath33 is slightly more complicated .",
    "first of all we need a rescaled version of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , if firm @xmath0 sells goods to @xmath36 external markets then @xmath37 . with this notation @xmath38",
    "finally we must deal with the multiplicative penalty term due to lack of supply for ` primary suppliers ' and ` end consumers ' . as it is assumed that there is no limit to the amount ` primary suppliers ' ( including hubs ) can procure from outside the district , no penalty due to lack of supply",
    "will be imposed . in the case of an ` end consumer ' ( but not a hub )",
    "the penalty term will be the same as for the intermediary firms .",
    "however the penalty is applied to the @xmath21 term as this is now the term which incorporates the benefits to the utility from selling products or services .",
    "that is @xmath39         the average dairy farm in the uk has a herd size of 86 cows , and an average density of two cows per hectare  @xcite , which makes the average dairy farm 43 hectares , allowing the total fuel use to be calculated .",
    "@xcite also states that the average dairy cow yields @xmath41 litres of milk a year . with a spot price for milk at farm gate ( taken in mid september 2013 ) of @xmath42",
    "we have an average dairy farm revenue of @xmath43 .",
    "finally  @xcite gives a figure for the total production costs of @xmath44 whilst  @xcite states _",
    "`` feed costs represent [ ] 40 to 60 percent of the cost of producing milk '' .",
    "_ we take the average of 50% of total production costs being spent on feed ( materials ) , meaning that material costs and the production costs ( excluding materials ) in table  [ t : data ] are both same ; @xmath45 .",
    "we base our analysis of anaerobic digestion on gwe biogass ltd which converts 50,000 tonnes of waste a year to biogas which is the converted to 2mw of electricity  @xcite . if we assume that the plant operates for the equivalent of 300 complete days a year it generates 14.4 gwh of electricity .",
    "further  @xcite gives that the mass of sludge ( digestate ) out is 80% to 90% of the mass in .",
    "using the figure of 80% gives that the plant produces @xmath46 tonnes of sludge a year .",
    "schiller  @xcite suggests that digestate has a value of @xmath47 , giving a revenue from digestate of @xmath48 . from  @xcite",
    "we can calculate the price the firm gets from sale of electricity , table a-4 gives a basic price of  @xmath49 and table a-8 gives an additional price for electricity support ( to incentivise production of electricity from ` green ' sources ) of  @xmath50 .",
    "this gives a total gain of  @xmath51 ( @xmath52 inflation adjusted ) .",
    "meaning that the revenue from selling electricity is @xmath53 per year .",
    "so the total revenue ( sales ) is @xmath54 .",
    "the price for materials is negative .",
    "the anaerobic digester uses waste from other industries as its source material .",
    "if it did nt use this material then the industry would have to pay for its disposal , ( traditionally through landfill or incineration ) .",
    "schiller  @xcite suggests a price of @xmath55 to dispose of waste . as gwe biogas use 50,000 tonnes of waste a year",
    "their material costs are @xmath56 .    finally the overheads and production costs .",
    "* table 4 ) gives the overheads for an anaerobic digestion plant with 70,000 tonne capacity as  @xmath57 ( @xmath58 inflation adjusted ) .",
    "a simple scaling for the difference in capacity gives an approximation of the overheads for gwe biogas as @xmath59 .",
    "for the production costs we use the opex costs as given in  @xcite , a value of  @xmath60 ( @xmath61 inflation adjusted ) . multiplying this by the 50,000 tonne capacity",
    "gives the value used in table  [ t : data ] .",
    "we base our analysis of coal - fired power plants on a 900mw capacity plant running for 7880 hours ( full time equivalent ) a year .",
    "our analysis is based on these specifics as this forms one of the cases studied in  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "different technologies are considered as well as different coal types .",
    "we shall average the data over these technological and coal type differences to arrive at the values used .",
    "the technologies used are described as subcritical , supercritical and ultra supercritical , whilst the three coal types analysed are bituminous , lignite and prb .",
    "now ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) gives the annual production of electricity ( in twh ) across these 9 scenarios as 6.53 , 6.47 , 6.60 , 6.54 , 6.48 , 6.61 , 6.54 , 6.49 and 6.61 .",
    "thus the average electricity generation is @xmath62 .",
    "we assume that this electricity is sold at the same basic price ( no subsidies ) as that generated by anaerobic digestion , i.e.   @xmath49 ( @xmath63 inflation adjusted ) , this gives the sales figure for coal - fired power plants .    in order to calculate the material cost",
    ", we need to know how much coal is burned and the cost of that coal .",
    "the cost of coal to the gate is given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) as $ 39.55 , $ 17.90 and $ 23.47 per tonne depending on type and quality .",
    "this gives an average price of $ @xmath64 ( @xmath65 inflation adjusted ) .",
    "further  @xcite says that a 100mw power plant uses 53.8 tonnes of coal an hour . assuming no efficiencies of scale this means that a 900mw power plant uses 484.2 tonnes of coal an hour .",
    "the annual material cost is thus given by @xmath66 .",
    "* appendix a ) also gives values for fixed and variable costs .",
    "we use the variable costs for the overheads and the fixed costs for production costs .",
    "so for overheads we take the average of 27.33 , 38.51 , 20.03 , 27.64 , 38.99 , 20.24 , 28.35 , 40.06 and 20.71 ( $ m ) , which is $ @xmath67 ( @xmath68 inflation adjusted ) . for the production",
    "costs we take the average of 19.07 , 19.43 and 19.61 ( $ m ) , which is $ @xmath69 ( @xmath70 inflation adjusted ) .",
    "we base our analysis of a biomass - fired power plant on the proposed drax heron plant , which would burn 1.4 million tonnes of biomass a year to produce 290mw of electricity  @xcite . again to calculate the revenue we shall use the same basic price for electricity generated as for the anaerobic digester , namely  @xmath49 ( @xmath63 inflation adjusted ) .",
    "there used to be an additional subsidy linked to how much biomass was burnt  @xcite , but that has recently been repealed .",
    "thus , assuming that the power plant operates for 7200 ( full time equivalent ) hours a year the revenue from electricity generation is @xmath71 . to calculate the material cost we just need a price for biomass .",
    "we use the value for wood chips of @xmath47 given in  @xcite , meaning that the total material cost is @xmath72 .    to calculate the production costs we note that  @xcite gives annual operating costs of 2% of capital costs and annual maintenance costs of 2.5% of capital costs . the 250mw power plant that they use in their analysis had a capital cost of @xmath73 . scaling with no economies of scale",
    "gives a capital cost for a 290mw plant of @xmath74 ( @xmath75 inflation adjusted ) .",
    "however it is likely that economies of scale should be taken in to effect , as a result we shall use a capital cost of @xmath76 .",
    "we use the annual operating and maintenance costs as a proxy for the production costs giving a production cost of @xmath77 .",
    "finally , we need a value for the overheads . we were unable to find specific data for biomass burning power plants , so instead we use data for coal - burning power plants given in  ( * ? ? ? * appendix a ) .",
    "as for the coal - firing power plant we use the total variable costs averaged over the three technology types and the three coal types .",
    "the smallest plant that they analyse is 400mw , for this size plant the values given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) are 11.6 , 17.5 , 8.9 , 11.2 , 16.9 , 8.6 , 11.0 , 16.6 and 8.5 ( $ @xmath24 ) .",
    "this gives an average value of $ @xmath78 ( @xmath79 inflation adjusted ) .",
    "we need to adjust this to the capacity of the drax heron plant , a simple scaling would give @xmath80 .",
    "however the overheads for smaller plants are proportionally smaller , as can be seen from considering the 900mw plant use in section  [ a : ppc ] , this would give a scaled value of @xmath81 . the difference in capacity between the plants leading to these two figure",
    "is 500mw , and the closest of the figures comes from a plant which is 110mw larger than the plant we consider , therefore the overheads are given by @xmath82 .",
    "the analysis of co - firing power plants ( coal and bio - mass ) is based on drax ,  @xcite , which has a capacity of 3960 mw and generates @xmath83 of electricity each year . using the same selling price of electricity as both the coal - firing and biomass firing plants ( the same as the anaerobic digester s unsubsidised price ) of @xmath63 gives revenue of @xmath84 .",
    "as the plant burns both biomass and coal calculating the cost of materials requires knowledge of how much of each fuel is used each year . from  @xcite",
    "we have that drax consumes 9.1 m tonnes of coal a year and 1.725 m tonnes of biomass ( a 660mw plant full burning biomass requires 2.3 m tonnes of biomass a year , whilst drax co - fires 12.5% biomass ) . using the same cost for coal as for the coal - firing power plant ( @xmath65 ) and the same cost for biomass as the biomass - burning power plant ( @xmath47 ) we arrive at a total material cost of @xmath85 .",
    "we were unable to find any accurate data for overheads and production costs of co - firing plants .",
    "instead we use the values derived for the coal - firing power plant and multiply them by three , to scale from 900 mw to 3960 mw assuming a large economy of scale .",
    "there appears to be very little data on the economics of various types of composter ; low grade , high grade and in - vessel .",
    "instead it seems that any economic analysis is on a case by case basis . as such we do not treat all three of these ` industry types ' independently but rather simply as composters",
    "this means that the only difference in the composters in the model will be in their structural role in the metabolic interactions network .",
    "we base our analysis of composters on  @xcite which looks at a canadian composter in 1993 .",
    "we do not believe that this should pose any issues to the accuracy of the figures derived as approximations due to the fact that composting is a well established technique , and whilst some efficiencies may have been made we do not believe that this would drastically effect the economics of a composter . in what follows we use the standard notation c$ to refer to canadian dollars , also c$1 in 1993 is now worth @xmath86 inflation adjusted .",
    "the composter studied in @xcite produces 1806 tonnes ( 3.254 ml ) of compost a year ,  ( * ? ? ?",
