    "recently , it has been shown that energy can be transmitted along a one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain of equally spaced metallic nanoparticles , via propagating surface plasmon ( sp ) modes  @xcite .",
    "these modes are basically linear combinations of single grain sp modes , i.  e. oscillations of electronic charge within a single grain@xcite .",
    "the single - grain modes are accompanied by an oscillating electric moment ( dipole and higher ) on the grain .",
    "the electric field of this moment in turn generates oscillating moments on neighboring spheres .",
    "the propagating sp modes are simply traveling waves of these oscillating moments .",
    "they are characterized by well defined dispersion relations @xmath10 which relate their frequencies @xmath11 and wave vectors @xmath1@xcite .",
    "if the damping is sufficiently small , the energy transmitted by these ways may travel at speeds up to 0.1c .",
    "thus , one can imagine a variety of possible uses for these waves .",
    "the calculation of @xmath10 typically involves several approximations .",
    "the first of these is the _ near field _",
    "approximation - that is , one assumes that @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the wave number and @xmath2 the interparticle separation .",
    "this assumption permits the electric field @xmath12 to be calculated in the quasistatic limit , in which @xmath12 is expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential .",
    "a second common approximation is that the field produced by a given particle at its neighbors is that of a _ point dipole_. however , this second assumption is stronger than the quasistatic approximation , and becomes inaccurate when the particles are closely spaced . under these conditions ,",
    "the quasistatic fields may be modified significantly by multipolar interactions .",
    "typically , these multipolar fields have been included by numerical techniques such as finite - difference time - domain calculations .",
    "however , it may be difficult to obtain accurate results by these numerical techniques , because the higher multipole excitations may produce fields which vary rapidly in space , whereas numerical studies with insufficient discretization may not achieve adequate resolution .",
    "thus , an exact calculation in a simple geometry may not only provide physical insights into this system , but also give useful guidelines for the validity of numerical calculations in more complex geometries .    in the present work",
    ", we will show how these multipolar corrections can be calculated _ exactly _ , using a straightforward analytical approach .",
    "the formalism is analogous to the generalized tight - binding method in conventional band theory . in this approach ,",
    "one constructs bloch states from individual atomic orbitals , and then diagonalizes the hamiltonian matrix in the basis of these atomic orbitals . in the surface plasmon analog ,",
    "the individual atomic orbitals are multipolar sp oscillations for each sphere .",
    "the matrix elements needed to calculate the hamiltonian matrix are easily constructed , especially for a periodic one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain of spheres .",
    "the diagonalization needed to calculate the bands is readily carried out .",
    "the entire calculation is made simpler in 1d systems , because the hamiltonian matrix decomposes into separate blocks , one for each azimuthal quantum number @xmath13 .",
    "the basic formalism necessary to carry out this calculation@xcite has thus far been applied only rather sparingly , because there have been few experimentally available realizations of the ordered geometry required for this approach .",
    "it has been applied mainly to calculating the effective complex dielectric function @xmath14 of a periodic composite medium , which requires the sp band structure only at bloch vector @xmath15 .",
    "only recently has it become possible to produce well - controlled ordered metallic structures at the nanoscale , and hence to generate and detect these sp waves at general wave vectors . in this paper , we describe and numerically solve the equation necessary to calculate this band structure in the general case of @xmath16 in 1d systems .    besides giving the solutions in the full multipolar case",
    ", we also include damping of the sp modes due to losses within the individual metallic particles . for a drude metal",
    ", these losses can be treated by including a finite relaxation time @xmath17 in the drude dielectric function .",
    "this damping can be included approximately by adding an imaginary part to the sp frequencies .",
    "we also briefly discuss why the damping due to radiative energy losses is expected to be small .",
    "these losses arise from the breakdown of the quasistatic approximation , and can , in principle , also be approximately included by adding an imaginary part to the surface plasmon frequency .",
    "we will also present the multipolar sp equations in the _ time _ domain for a drude metal , where they take the form of a set of coupled second order ordinary differential equations .",
    "in this form , it is straightforward to include single - particle damping ( and also , in principle , radiative damping ) .",
    "moreover , one can also incorporate driving terms , arising , e.  g. , from external electric fields .",
    "these equations may thus be useful in modeling specific types of experimental probes which produce localized time - dependent electric fields .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the formalism needed to calculate the sp band structure , and specialize to the calculation for a 1d chain .",
    "section iii presents numerical results in this 1d chain system . in section iv",
    ", we discuss our results , and suggest some possible extensions to other geometries .",
    "finally , the appendix presents an alternative formulation of the equations of motion in the time domain , and describes how localized time - dependent driving electric fields can be included in these equations .",
    "we consider a 1d chain of spherical particles of radius @xmath18 , separated by a distance @xmath2 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the particles are assumed to be arranged along the @xmath20 axis with centers at @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that the particles and host have dielectric functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 . to be definite",
    ", we may consider the particles as metallic and the host as insulating , but the discussion below applies to any choice of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "all the formalism is given in terms of a frequency variable @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 as will be seen below , and as is discussed indirectly in ref .",
    "@xcite , all the allowed propagating sp frequencies correspond to @xmath29 in the range @xmath31 , or equivalently , to @xmath32 , assuming that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are both real .",
    "we will calculate the sp band structure in an `` atomic '' basis @xmath33 . here ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath13 label the `` angular momentum '' of the eigenfunction , and @xmath35 labels the grain .",
    "thus the allowed values of these indices are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 . in order to calculate the sp band structure in this basis ,",
    "we first need the matrix element @xmath39 , where @xmath40 . this matrix element is given by ( see , e.  g. , ref .",

    "@xmath45 is either @xmath48 or @xmath49 , depending on whether @xmath50 is positive or negative .",
    "if @xmath51 , @xmath52 , whereas if @xmath53 , @xmath54 . incorporating these simplifications , we find that with @xmath55^{1/2}}\\left(\\frac{n^\\prime - n}{|n^\\prime - n| } \\right)^{\\ell+\\ell^\\prime}\\delta_{m , m^\\prime}. \\label{eq : qlmn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrix elements are diagonal in @xmath13 because the one - dimensional chain is unchanged on rotation by any angle about the @xmath20 axis .",
    "next , we define the matrix element @xmath56 where the sum runs over all positive and negative integers except @xmath57 .",
    "we have used the fact that , for this periodic 1d system , @xmath58 is a function only of @xmath59 and vanishes for @xmath60 . after a little algebra , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qlmn ] ) and ( [ eq : qk ] ) , we obtain @xmath61 for @xmath62 even , and @xmath63 for @xmath64 odd , where @xmath65^{1/2}}.\\ ] ]    finally , in terms of the matrix elements @xmath66 ; the sp structure is given by @xmath67 where the `` hamiltonian '' @xmath68 has matrix elements @xmath69 and the `` atomic '' eigenvalues @xmath70 are given by @xmath71 note that @xmath72 , while @xmath73 as @xmath74 .",
    "the full sp band structure at wave vector @xmath1 is obtained by diagonalizing the matrix ( [ eq : matrix ] ) . as in conventional band theory , there are many band energies for a given @xmath1 , and one need consider only the bands in the first brillouin zone , i.  e. , in this case , for @xmath75 , since the states at other values of k are equivalent to those in the first zone . for this one - dimensional system ,",
    "the hamiltonian breaks into separate blocks , one for each value of @xmath13 ; this conveniently reduces the size of the matrix which needs to be diagonalized . finally , as in the lcao ( linear combination of atomic orbital ) method of conventional band theory , the band structure that results from this analysis",
    "is composed of bands which originate from various `` atomic '' orbitals . in the present case ,",
    "the the `` atomic '' states are multipolar sp modes associated with the individual spheres .",
    "these are degenerate at different @xmath13 ( since the individual particles are spheres ) , and have eigenvalues @xmath76 .    the band structure that results from diagonalizing the matrix ( [ eq : matrix ] ) is expressed in terms of the variable @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the bands have the form @xmath77 , where @xmath78 labels the individual bands .",
    "these may be converted into frequencies using the relation ( [ eq : s ] ) .",
    "this dispersion relation will take on various forms , according to how @xmath27 ( and @xmath28 ) depend on @xmath11 . here",
    "we assume that the system consists of drude metal particles in vacuum , so that @xmath79 and @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath81 , then the appropriate conversion is given by @xmath82 for @xmath83 there are three degenerate modes at frequency @xmath84 , while for @xmath85 , the modes approach the limiting value of @xmath86 .",
    "if the relaxation time is finite , then the relation @xmath87 can be inverted to express @xmath11 as a function of @xmath29 . for a real @xmath29 ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath11 has both a real and imaginary part .",
    "thus , we can map an eigenvalue @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 is a band index ) to a _ complex _",
    "eigenvalue @xmath88 the imaginary part describes the damping of this mode due to the finite lifetime of the surface plasmons in the individual spheres . if @xmath89 , this damping is small , and the shift due to the damping ( as embodied in the factor @xmath90 within the square root ) is even smaller . note that we have not included radiative damping in this expression .",
    "in contrast to single - particle damping , the radiative damping depends on the particle size , being greater for larger particles . for 10-nm radius gold spheres",
    ", it has been estimated that only 1.5% of the total damping rate is due to radiative damping  @xcite . also , according to refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the radiative damping should be small for particles of such a size because of strong near - field interactions .    in the appendix",
    ", we present an alternative formulation of the equations of motion in the time domain to obtain the sp band structure , assuming a drude dielectric function . in this formulation , which has the advantage that it can deal with localized time - dependent driving electric fields , these radiative corrections could easily be included , as has been discussed , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in order to compare with experiment , we will consider two more quantities which can be obtained from the dispersion relation @xmath10 : first , the @xmath1-dependent group velocity @xmath91 is given by the relation @xmath92 and can be easily computed numerically , given @xmath10 .",
    "secondly , we can also use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : solution ] ) and ( [ eq : vg ] ) to estimate the energy loss from a plasmon propagating along a chain , which is important in applications . for this purpose",
    ", we define energy decay lengths , @xmath93 for the lowest longitudinal and transverse modes , as the distance over which the energy density in the wave amplitude decreases by a factor @xmath94 .",
    "if the complex band frequency is denoted @xmath95 , then @xmath93 is defined by @xmath96 note that in the case of the drude approximation , the imaginary part of the complex band frequency does not depend on @xmath1 , and thus @xmath5 is just proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "we have diagonalized the matrix ( [ eq : matrix ] ) to obtain the surface plasmon band structure for various values of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "we include all bands up to @xmath97 , which is sufficient to insure convergence of @xmath77 to within 1% .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for comparison , we also show the results of truncating the hamiltonian matrix at @xmath83 . in this latter case ,",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is a diagonal @xmath98 matrix with elements @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the corresponding plasmon bands , expressed as @xmath102 , are shown as open square ( @xmath103 ) and circle ( @xmath104 ) in fig .  1 .",
    "if we use the drude expressions @xmath105 , then these correspond exactly to the dipolar sp band structures obtained in ref .",
    "this behavior is as expected , since when we retain only the @xmath83 terms in the hamiltonian , we are neglecting all the quasistatic contributions except the dipole fields .    as is evident ,",
    "the plasmon bands take on quite a different form when the higher values of @xmath34 are included in the hamiltonian matrix . for small values of @xmath7 ( i.  e. @xmath106 ) ,",
    "the lowest three bands are very similar to the bands obtained when only the @xmath83 matrix elements are included .",
    "this behavior is not surprising , since at these values of @xmath7 the matrix elements connecting the @xmath83 states to those of higher @xmath34 are quite small , for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "this smallness originates in the factors of @xmath107 which appear in all the expressions for the matrix elements .",
    "the smallest factor connecting @xmath83 to higher @xmath108 is @xmath109 for @xmath110 , and @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "thus , for relatively small values of @xmath7 , these connecting matrix elements are substantially smaller than the diagonal ones .    when @xmath113 , the interband matrix elements start to become substantial .",
    "when this happens , the shapes of the lowest bands start to depart significantly from the purely dipolar form seen for smaller @xmath7 .",
    "as is evident , by the time @xmath114 , the band structures of the lowest bands are so altered that they no longer bear any obvious relation to these dipolar band shapes . precisely at @xmath115 ,",
    "the lowest state at @xmath112 reaches the limiting value @xmath116 .",
    "this behavior is a percolation effect : when @xmath115 , the two neighboring spheres just touch , and the entire line of spheres becomes one connected chain .",
    "thus , one might expect that the lowest eigenvalues of this chain would resemble that of a very long cylinder , which indeed has as its lowest eigenvalue @xmath116 .",
    "the band structure also acquires a striking symmetry near @xmath117 .",
    "first , there appears to be a nearly perfect reflection symmetry about the line @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , there is another reflection symmetry about the line @xmath119 , i.  e. at the middle value of @xmath1 in the first brillouin zone .",
    "as particular examples of these symmetries , there appear to be eigenvalues of @xmath116 and @xmath120 at @xmath121 , just as there are at @xmath112 .",
    "we do not fully understand the reasons for these symmetries .",
    "the @xmath122 eigenvalue at @xmath121 apparently corresponds to a longitudinal mode ( dipole moment of the spheres parallel to the @xmath20 axis ) in which each sphere oscillates 180@xmath123 out of phase with its neighbors .",
    "the multitude of modes near @xmath118 presumably originate in the high-@xmath34 `` atomic '' modes , which have eigenvalues approaching @xmath118 .    in fig .  2",
    ", we show the eigenvalues of the two lowest bands at @xmath112 plotted as a function of @xmath7 . here",
    ", the lowest band corresponds to longitudinal mode ( @xmath103 ) and the second lowest band to degenerate transverse modes ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "we performed two different calculations : in the first calculation , shown as open circles and squares , we assumed the dipole approximation and included only the @xmath83 part of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "this calculation corresponds to the tight - binding approximation used in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the second",
    ", we included all bands up to @xmath97 , which is sufficient to ensure the convergence of these two bands , as in fig .  1 ,",
    "and this inclusion of the higher multipoles starts to make a substantial difference for @xmath113 .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "2 shows the splitting @xmath125 between the longitudinal and transverse modes at @xmath112 , plotted as a function of @xmath7 . in the dipole approximation ( dashed line ) , this splitting increases monotonically as @xmath7 increases .",
    "however , as shown by the solid line in the inset , when the higher multipoles are included , the splitting reaches a maximum near @xmath126 , then decreases again .    in order to compare with experiment",
    ", one needs to re - express the band structure as dispersion relations for @xmath10 rather than @xmath127 , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) . with the resulting @xmath10",
    ", we can also obtain @xmath91 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vg ] ) and @xmath5 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) .",
    "we show the resulting dispersion relations @xmath128 in fig .  3 ( a ) , and the resulting @xmath93 and @xmath91 in fig .  3 ( b ) for the lowest longitudinal and transverse bands as a function of @xmath129 .",
    "we denote these results as open square and circle for @xmath130 , the value used in experiments , and also as solid and dashed lines for @xmath8 , which is near the maximum of the splitting @xmath125 . in order to calculate @xmath128 , we choose @xmath131 rad / s and @xmath132 fs , as used in ref .",
    "this choice allows us to compare the present result for @xmath6 with those given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "first , we compare our results for @xmath6 with experiment . for @xmath6 , the result of the full calculation for @xmath10",
    "is not significantly different from the dipole approximation , since multipole effects produce only a minor alteration to the lowest bands in this case .",
    "however , the multipole effects can be seen much more clearly in the @xmath1-dependent group velocity @xmath91 for these bands , and this quantity can be easily computed numerically , using the @xmath10 shown in fig .  3 ( a ) .",
    "in contrast to the result from the dipole approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the maximum in @xmath4 for @xmath6 does not occur at @xmath133 , but instead around @xmath134 , when the multipolar corrections are included . however , if we assume @xmath135 nm , @xmath136 rad / s , and @xmath132 fs as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the _ magnitude _ of the maximum @xmath4 for the longitudinal ( @xmath103 ) mode is approximately @xmath137 m / s , which is close to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , while the magnitude of @xmath4 for the transverse ( @xmath138 ) modes is slightly larger than the value ( @xmath139 m / s ) estimated in ref .",
    "also , the values of @xmath5 in the lowest longitudinal and transverse modes for @xmath130 are comparable to the experimental values for gold , as given in ref .  @xcite .    for @xmath8 , which is near the maximum of the splitting @xmath125 , the multipole corrections to the band structure are much greater . as @xmath7 approaches the maximum splitting between longitudinal ( @xmath103 ) and transverse ( @xmath124 )",
    "modes , the variation of @xmath4 with @xmath1 becomes non - monotonic .",
    "in contrast to the dipole approximation , which gives a maximum group velocity at @xmath133 , our exact calculation actually gives a local _ minimum _ in @xmath4 for this value of @xmath1 ( for both polarizations ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "3(b ) , @xmath91 has , in fact , two maxima as a function of @xmath1 for this separation , for both longitudinal and transverse modes .",
    "the maximum estimated exponential decay length shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , for the optimum @xmath1 , corresponds to an @xmath103 wave , and is about three times larger than that for @xmath6 .",
    "but this decay length is calculated for a wave with @xmath1 vector corresponding to the maximum group velocity .",
    "the actual @xmath4 is strongly @xmath1-dependent , especially for the larger @xmath7 .",
    "thus a typical wave , which would likely propagate as a packet of many different wave vectors , would likely have a quite different decay length , and also would probably not decay exponentially .",
    "it is possible that this @xmath1-dependence is related to the non - exponential spatial decay of sp s found in the numerical simulations of ref.@xcite .",
    "we have not commented thus far about the role of the higher sp bands . for values of @xmath7 greater than about 0.33 ,",
    "most of these bands are nearly dispersionless , with eigenvalues @xmath140 .",
    "the sp modes corresponding to these bands will thus propagate with very small group velocity @xmath141 , and are likely to contribute very little to energy transport along the chain .",
    "in this work , we have calculated the surface plasmon dispersion relations for a one - dimensional chain of spherical particles in a uniform host .",
    "in contrast to previous work , we have included all the multipolar terms in our calculation , within the quasistatic approximation .",
    "we find that the dipole approximation is reasonably accurate for @xmath142 , but becomes increasingly inaccurate for larger @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath114 , the lowest band shapes are entirely different from the point - dipole predictions .",
    "thus , an accurate comparison of theory to experiment should take into account these corrections , when @xmath7 exceeds about 1/3 .    in our results near @xmath115",
    "we see conspicuous percolation effects .",
    "specifically , the @xmath112 mode approaches zero frequency for a chain of drude spheres in an insulating host .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath114 , the entire band structure shows remarkable reflection symmetry , both around @xmath119 and around the frequency midpoint at @xmath118 .",
    "we do not presently understand the reasons for this symmetry .    besides producing shape distortions in the lowest bands",
    ", the present calculations also lead to an infinite number of higher propagating sp bands .",
    "we believe , however , that these will contribute little to energy propagation , because they are characterized by much lower group velocities than the lowest two bands .    our calculations in fig .",
    "3 have , of course , been carried out in the drude approximation . as mentioned earlier , we used values of @xmath143 and @xmath144 as best fits to experiments on bulk gold , as described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in actuality , the complex dielectric functions of silver , and especially gold , have substantial interband contributions , and can not be described by a drude dielectric function in the visible .",
    "an accurate translation of the sp band structure from the variable @xmath29 to the variable @xmath145 should use this more accurate dielectric function , e.  g. by using a fit of the experimental @xmath25 to a sum of free - electron and lorentz oscillator parts . this more complicated procedure might somewhat change the plasmon band structures , especially for gold .",
    "another possible complication is that , in typical experiments , the nanoparticle chains are laid down on a substrate , whose dielectric constant differs from that of vacuum .",
    "thus , the chain is not really embedded in a homogeneous dielectric .",
    "some workers have taken this complication into account by treating the host as homogeneous but with a dielectric function which is an average over the air and substrate dielectric functions  @xcite . once again , this correction , if included , would also modify the calculated sp band structure .    the present work could be readily be generalized to higher dimensions , e.  g. to an ordered layer of spheres deposited on a substrate .",
    "this extension should be straightforward , since the matrix elements required are the same as used here .",
    "the same approach could also be applied to particles of different shapes , e.  g. ellipsoids or short cylinders , although the calculation of the single particle eigenstates and the overlap integrals might be more difficult .",
    "we plan to carry out some of these extensions in the near future .",
    "this work was supported by nsf grant no .",
    "dmr01 - 04987 , and benefited also from the computational facilities of the ohio supercomputer center .",
    "if the small spherical particles are described by a drude dielectric function , the sp band structure can be also obtained , in perhaps a more intuitive way , by writing down a set of coupled equations of motion in _ time _ for the multipole moments .",
    "we first introduce the scalar quantities @xmath146 , defined as the @xmath147 multipole moment of the @xmath148 particle .",
    "then , in the absence of damping , the coupled equations of motion can be written in the form @xmath149 where the prime over the sum indicates a sum only over the grains @xmath150 . for spherical grains ,",
    "the single - grain resonant frequencies are given by @xmath151 and the coupling constants @xmath152 are given by eq .",

    "( [ eq : eom ] ) reduces to a set of coupled homogeneous linear algebraic equations .",

    "( [ eq : eom ] ) has a straightforward physical interpretation . the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) describes two contributions to the force acting on the multipole moment @xmath146 .",
    "the first term is the restoring force due to charge motion within a single particle .",
    "the second term on the right comes from the electric fields of all the multipole fields from the other particles , evaluated at the position of the @xmath148 particle . damping is easily included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) by adding to the right - hand side the term @xmath155 . to obtain solutions in the presence of damping , we assume the form ( [ eq : soln ] ) but with a",

    "the resulting @xmath157 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : solution ] ) .    an appealing feature of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) is that one can easily add a driving term .",
    "for example , if a uniform electric field @xmath158 is applied to the @xmath148 grain , the interaction energy between that field and the @xmath148 grain would be @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the dipole moment of the @xmath148 grain . to calculate the force on the @xmath148 grain",

    "the corresponding force on the charge is just @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the total mass of the electronic charge in the grain .",
