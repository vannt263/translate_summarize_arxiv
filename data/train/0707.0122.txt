    "objects of different scale and nature in the universe : from young and very old stars to galactic nuclei show existence of collimated outbursts - jets . geometrical sizes of jets lay between parsecs and megaparsecs .",
    "the origin of jets is not well understood and only several qualitative mechanisms are proposed which are not justified by calculations .",
    "theory of jets must give answers to three main questions : how jets are formed ?",
    "how are they stabilized ?",
    "how do they radiate ?",
    "the last question is related to the problem of the origin if relativistic particles in outbursts from agn , where synchrotron emission is observed .",
    "relativistic particles , ejected from the central machine rapidly loose their energy so the problem arises of particle acceleration inside the jet , see review of bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1993 ) .",
    "it is convenient sometimes to investigate jets in a simple model of infinitely long circular cylinder , chandrasekhar & fermi ( 1953 ) .",
    "the magnetic field in the collimated jets determines its direction , and the axial current may stabilize the jet s elongated form at large distances from the source ( e.g. in agns ) , ( bisnovatyi - kogan et al . , 1969 ) .",
    "when observed with high angular resolution these jets show a structure with bright knots separated by relatively dark regions ( thomson et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "high percentages of polarization , sometimes exceeding 50% , indicate the nonthermal nature of the radiation , explained as synchrotron emission of the relativistic electrons in an ordered magnetic field .    here",
    "we consider stabilization of a jet by magnetohydrodynamic mechanism , connected with torsional oscillations .",
    "we suggest that the matter in the jet is rotating , and different parts of the jet rotate in different directions . such distribution of the rotational velocity produces azimuthal magnetic field , which prevents a disruption of the jet .",
    "the jet remains to be in a dynamical equilibrium , when it is representing a periodical , or quasiperiodical structure along the axis , and its radius is oscillating with time all along the axis",
    ". the space and time period of oscillations depend on the conditions at jet formation : the length scale , the amplitude of the rotational velocity , and the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the time period of oscillations should be obtained during construction of the dynamical model , what also should show at which input parameters may exist a long jet , stabilized by torsional oscillations .        here",
    "we construct a simplified model of this phenomena , which confirms the reality of such stabilization , see also bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2007 ) .",
    "consider a long cylinder with a magnetic field directed along its axis ( fig.1 )",
    ". this cylinder will expand unlimitly under the action of pressure and magnetic forces .",
    "the limitation of the radius of this cylinder could be possible in dynamic state , when the whole cylinder undergoes magneto - torsional oscillations .",
    "such oscillations produce toroidal field , which prevent a radial expansion .",
    "there is a competition between the induced toroidal field , compressing the cylinder in radial direction , and gas pressure , together with the field along the cylinder axis ( poloidal ) , tending to increase its radius.during magneto - torsional oscillations there are phases , when either compression or expansion forces prevail , and , depending on the input parameters , we may expect tree kinds of a behavior of such cylinder .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is low , so the cylinder suffers unlimited expansion ( no confinement )    \\2 .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is too high , so the pinch action of the toroidal field destroys the cylinder , and leads to formation of separated blobs .    \\3 .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is moderate , so the cylinder survives for an unlimited time , and its parameters ( radius , density , magnetic field etc . )",
    "change periodically , or quasi - periodically in time .",
    "here we try to find a simple approximate way for obtaining a qualitative answer , and to make a rough estimation of parameters leading to different regimes .",
    "we simplify the system of mhd equations with axial symmetry , @xmath0=0 , for the perfect gas at infinite conductivity , written in cylindric coordinates @xmath1 ( landau and lifshits , 1982 ) .",
    "we use for this purpose a profiling procedure .",
    "there is no gravity in the direction of the cylinder axis ( @xmath2 ) , and we approximate density by a function @xmath3 , suggesting a uniform density along the radius . the components of the velocity and magnetic field are approximated as    @xmath4    @xmath5    in this case the current components are written as    @xmath6    after neglecting velocity @xmath7 along the axis , we should omit the corresponding euler equation , and the radial pressure gradient is approximated by the linear function , what gives , when using appropriate dimensions    @xmath8    where the constant @xmath9 is connected with the equation of state , @xmath10 is the pressure , @xmath11 is the radius of the cylinder . in the subsequent consideration",
    "we consider an adiabatic case with a polytropic equation of state @xmath12 .",
    "neglecting the @xmath2 derivatives in the poisson equation , we obtain @xmath13 . substituting ( [ eq15])-([eq18 ] ) into the original system of the equations , we obtain for the profiling functions",
    "the following equations    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    it follows from ( [ eq21]),([eq24 ] ) relations , representing conservation of mass , and magnetic flux equivalent to freezing condition    @xmath19    in our subsequent consideration the arbitrary functions will be taken as constants : @xmath20 it was shown by bisnovatyi - kogan ( 2007)that the approximate system of equations describes correctly small perturbations , connected with radial and torsional modes , in the equilibrium self - gravitating cylinder .",
    "we expect therefore that these modes will be described correctly in general nonlinear case in the jets where gravity is neglected .",
    "for the relativistic jet we neglect gravity , without which the equilibrium static state of the cylinder does not exist .",
    "we need to solve numerically the system of nonlinear equations ( [ eq19])-([eq26 ] ) to check the possibility of the existence of a cylinder , which radius remains finite due to torsional oscillations .",
    "instead we reduce the system to ordinary equations . supposing a constant bulk motion velocity along @xmath2-axis , we consider axially symmetric jet in the comoving coordinate frame .",
    "if the confinement is reached due to standing magneto - torsional oscillations , there are points along @xmath2-axis where rotational velocity remains zero in this frame . taking @xmath21 in the plane @xmath22 ,",
    "let us consider standing wave torsional oscillations with the space period @xmath23 along @xmath2 axis",
    ". then nodes with @xmath21 are situated at @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "let us write the equations , describing the cylinder behavior in the plane @xmath22 , where @xmath21 .",
    "all values in this plane we denote by ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we take also for simplicity @xmath27 .",
    "we have than equations in the plane @xmath22 as    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    initial conditions for the system ( [ eq40 ] ) - ( [ eq45 ] ) are    @xmath33    @xmath34 in ( [ eq40 ] ) - ( [ eq45 ] ) we have used relations    @xmath35    valid for any time . if the cylinder rotational velocity is antisymmetric relative to the plane @xmath22 , @xmath21 , and cylinder density distribution is symmetric relative to this plane , then we have extremum ( maximum ) of the azimuthal magnetic field @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , and zero value of @xmath38 , which reaches an extremum ( minimum ) in this plane with @xmath39 .",
    "the product @xmath40 also reaches an extremum in the plane @xmath22 , so that @xmath41 .",
    "the term with @xmath2 derivative in the equation ( [ eq43 ] ) is not equal to zero , and changes periodically during the torsional oscillations .",
    "we substitute approximately the derivative @xmath42 by the ratio @xmath43 , where @xmath23 is the space period of the torsional oscillations along @xmath2 axis .",
    "while @xmath21 in the plane @xmath22 , its derivative along @xmath2 is changing periodically with an amplitude @xmath44 , and frequency @xmath45 , which should be found from the solution of the problem .",
    "we approximate therefore    @xmath46    finally , we have from ( [ eq40]),([eq43]),([eq45 ] ) the following approximate system of equations , describing the non - linear torsional oscillations of the cylinder at given @xmath23 and @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48 the combination of last two equations gives    @xmath49    has a solution , satisfying initial condition ( [ eq46 ] ) , @xmath50 with account of which the first and third equations in ( [ eq49 ] ) are written as    @xmath51",
    "introduce non - dimensional variables @xmath52 in which differential equations have a form @xmath53 the problem is reduced to a system ( [ eq54 ] ) with two non - dimensional parameters : @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , and the second one is taken equal to unity in farther consideration . solution of this nonlinear system changes qualitatively with changing of the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "the solution of this system obtained numerically for different @xmath56 in the interval between 1.5 and 3.2 , may be divided into 3 groups .",
    "\\1 . at @xmath57",
    "there is no confinement , radius grows to infinity after several low - amplitude oscillations ( fig.2 ) .",
    ". with growing of @xmath56 the amplitude of oscillations increase , and at @xmath58 radius is not growing to infinity , but is oscillating around some average value , forming rather complicated curves ( figs . 3 - 5 ) .    \\3 . at @xmath59",
    "the radius goes to zero . at @xmath60",
    "the dependence of the radius @xmath61 with time may be very complicated , consisting of low - amplitude and large - amplitude oscillations , which finally lead to zero .",
    "the time at which radius becomes zero may happen at @xmath62 , like at @xmath56=2.4 , 2.6 ( bisnovatyi - kogan , 2006 ) , or goes trough very large radius , and returned back to zero value at very large time @xmath63 at @xmath56=2.3 , 2.55 , 2.8 ( figs .",
    "6 - 9 ) . at @xmath64",
    "the radius goes to zero at @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "10 ) , before the right side of the second equation ( [ eq54 ] ) returned to the positive value .",
    "consider isothermal equation of state @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the sound speed . for ultrarelativistic pair - plasma @xmath69 .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 , as a function of @xmath70 , @xmath23 , initial @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is written as @xmath73 the amplitude of oscillations @xmath74 , and @xmath45 should be found from the solution of the nonlinear system ( [ eq19])-([eq26 ] ) , together with the interval of values of @xmath56 at which confinement happens . in the approximate system ( [ eq54 ] ) only @xmath56 characterizes different regimes , what for given @xmath70 , @xmath23 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 determines a function @xmath75 for the collimated jet . to find approximately a self - consistent model with @xmath76 we use the the frequency linear oscillations @xmath77 .",
    "the frequency of non - linear oscillations is smaller , so we may write @xmath78 therefore @xmath79 on the edge of the cylinder the rotational velocity can not exceed the light velocity , so the solution has a physical sense only at @xmath80 .",
    "taking @xmath81 for non - linear oscillations we obtain a restriction @xmath82 . to have the sound velocity not exceeding @xmath83 ,",
    "the jet should contain baryons , which density @xmath71 exceeding about 30% of the total density of the jet . in a dense quasispherical stellar cluster around a supermassive black hole , the accretion disk is changing its direction of rotation , due to different sign of the angular momentum of the falling stars . in this sutuation",
    "the magneto - torsional oscillations should be inevitably generated in the outflowing jets .",
    "the knots in jets are observed in different objects , including a famous m87 jet . in the last one the knots are visible in radio , optics ( hiltner , 1959 ) , and x - rays ( wilson and yang , 2002 ) .",
    "it is possible that they are connected with magneto - torsional oscillations ."
