    "an important issue in the study of high-@xmath0 cuprates concerns how superconductivity can arise in a doped mott insulator@xcite . the d - wave pairing symmetry has been usually attributed to the reason that the electrons avoid a strong local coulomb repulsion .",
    "but in a doped mott insulator the on - site coulomb repulsion is so strong that the hilbert space of the electrons is also drastically altered .",
    "it is thus no longer sufficient just to focus on the relevant attractive interaction as in the framework of the bcs theory .",
    "rather a fundamental change in the underlying electronic structure should be taken into account before one can meaningfully address the issue of high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "the simplest straightforward method of incorporating  superconductivity with the mott physics  is to construct a gutzwiller - projected bcs superconductor .",
    "as first envisaged by andersonpwa_87 in 1987 , this class of state is always insulating at half - filling as all the double - occupancy states get projected out and the original cooper pairs in the bcs wavefunction become neutralized , known as the spin - singlet rvb pairs which are glued  by the superexchange coupling ( the state is to be referred to as the fermionic rvb state below ) .",
    "superconductivity arises only away from half - filling when the rvb pairs start to move in the presence of , say , empty sites in the hole doped case , which become partially charged cooper pairs . here",
    "the cooper and rvb pairings are no longer explicitly distinguishable .",
    "the gutzwiller - projected d - wave bcs state has been studiedpwa_03,gros_07 intensively as a class of variational wavefunctions for the doped mott insulator .",
    "it is also the basis for developing the so - called slave - boson approach@xcite , which is an electron fractionalization description with the gutzwiller projection replaced by emergent gauge fluctuations around the spin - charge - separated saddle - points .",
    "it predicted@xcite the presence of a high - temperature pseudogap phase over a finite doping regime and a superconducting dome at lower temperatures , which are both qualitatively consistent with the later experimental measurements in the cuprates@xcite .    however , the important long - range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) correlations are notably missing in the gutzwiller - projected bcs state at half - filling .",
    "in fact , it is a spin liquid with low - lying fermionic excitationspwa_87,bza_87,zhang_88 , which is in sharp contrast to a long - range afm order with bosonic spin - wave excitations governed by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) heisenberg model .",
    "of course one may argue here that once in the presence of some finite concentration of doped holes , the long - range afm order or correlations will disappear anyway , and hence the gutzwiller - projected bcs / spin liquid state could become stabilized eventually as a competitive ground state@xcite .",
    "but it remains to be a real challenge to understand how the long - range afm order / correlations of an antiferromagnet / mott insulator can be effectively destroyed by the motion of the doped holes , and how the associated energy , albeit only a small fraction in the total superexchange energy@xcite , gets turned off in order to gain the kinetic energy of the doped holes .",
    "the issue at the heart of a dope mott insulator is the _ competition _ between the kinetic and superexchange energies  if the afm correlations are weakened , like in the gutzwiller - projected bcs state , it would be much more favorable to the hopping of the doped holes ; with the enhanced afm correlations at low doping , on the other hand , the kinetic energy of the doped holes will get strongly suppressed .",
    "the novelty inherent from such incompatibility and competition between the hopping and the superexchange processes is thus expected@xcite to be responsible for the unconventional nature of the superconducting transition as well as a complex pseudogap phenomenon over a wide temperature regime above @xmath0 in a doped antiferromagnet / mott insulator .",
    "therefore , to properly accommodate such novelty , which may provide a basic understanding of the rich and marvelous pseudogap properties in the cuprates@xcite , both the rvb and cooper channels should remain generally distinguished even in the superconducting regime , which implies the necessity for one to go beyond the simple gutzwiller - projected bcs state approach to adequately address the interplay between the magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "another important property that the wavefunction should obey is an altered statistical sign rule : although the electrons always obey the fermi - dirac statistics , which dictates that two electrons of the same spin can not stay at the same lattice site , new statistics@xcite will emerge in a doped mott insulator where the no double occupancy constraint further enforces that two electrons of _ opposite _ spins can not occupy the same site .",
    "in fact , the t - j model at half - filling is totally bosonized  in the restricted hilbert space where the usual fermion signs are completely diminished : e.g. , the ground state only possesses the trivial marshall signs@xcite which can be easily gauged  away .",
    "the nontrivial signs start to reemerge in the doped case , induced by the hopping of the doped holes , which is precisely described by the so - called phase string effect@xcite in the t - j model .",
    "the corresponding sign structure is actually independent of temperature , dimensionality , and is of statistical natureweng_97,wwz_08 , which eventually recovers the full fermi statistical signs only at high doping in the dilute electron limit .",
    "physically the phase string effect also provides an accurate mathematical description of the so - called unrenormalizable phase shiftfirst emphasized by anderson early on@xcite .",
    "the latter is a total phase shift added up from all the electrons in the ground state , in response to adding / removing an electron into / from the system , due to the strong on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "consequently , the irreparable phase string effect / unrenormalizable phase shift will make the cooper pairing , associated with the doped holes , _ intrinsically _ distinguished from the neutral spin rvb pairing caused by superexchange , again suggesting the necessity to go beyond the gutzwiller - projected bcs state description",
    ".    a superconducting ground state distinct from the gutzwiller - projected bcs state has been previously constructed by the present author and coauthors@xcite with incorporating the above - mentioned sign structure .",
    "such a ground state can naturally reduce to an insulating afm state at half - filling , which well accounts for the long - range afm order as well as the short - range spin - spin correlations with a highly accurate variational superexchange energy , known as the bosonic rvb state@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the aforementioned fermionic rvb state , the doped holes are quite unfavorable to hop in the bosonic rvb ( neutral spin ) background which only involves the spin pairing between different sublattices .",
    "it was then shown@xcite that the doped holes will force a fundamental change in the rvb structure in order to gain the kinetic energy at finite doping , characterized by emergent backflow spinons  accompanying the hole hopping@xcite .",
    "it is these backflow spinons  that will be associated with the cooper pairs instead of the original bosonic rvb pairing .",
    "consequently both the bosonic rvb and cooper channels remain explicitly separated in the superconducting state [ cf .",
    "( 84 ) in ref .",
    "such a wavefunction description has demonstrated a rich complexity in the pseudogap regime as resulting from the competition between the rvb and cooper channels .    in this paper , we show that an important simplification in this approach can be made by realizing that the aforementioned backflow spinons  are actually fermionic upon a closer reexamination of the sign structure . in the previous formulation , they are described in the bosonic representation@xcite , which causes unnecessary complications because the extra fermionic statistical signs are mixed with the intrinsic phase string effect ( cf .",
    "ii a2 ) . as the result",
    ", we obtain a greatly simplified self - consistent description of both the ground state and excitations for the doped mott insulator .",
    "the key results are summarized in sec .",
    "the general form of the superconducting ground state is presented in sec .",
    "ii a , which is distinguished from the gutzwiller - projected bcs superconductor by a novel separation of cooper and rvb pairings .",
    "it precisely satisfies the altered statistical sign rule of the t - j model in the restricted hilbert space , which is of mutual semion type instead of the fermi - dirac one . in sec .",
    "ii b , it is shown that such a new class of wavefunctions can be intrinsically characterized by electron fractionalization , where neutral bosonic spinons and backflow  fermionic spinons together constitute a two - component rvb structure .",
    "the low - lying emergent gauge fields associated with such a specific fractionalization are of mutual chern - simons type , whose origin can be directly connected to the precise sign structure of the t - j model .",
    "the fractionalization formalism also makes the manipulation of the ground state significantly simplified as the constituent subsystems are more conventional , governed by the effective hamiltonians presented in sec .",
    "ii b2 . finally , corresponding to this superconducting ground state , three distinctive elementary excitations",
    "are briefly discussed in sec .",
    "ii c. among them a bogoliubov nodal quasiparticle is conventional , while the other two are non - bcs like neutral excitations that play dominant roles in higher energy / temperature regimes , controlling the superconducting phase transition and other exotic properties different from a conventional d - wave bcs superconductor .    in sec .",
    "iii , a microscopic justification of the present approach is presented in detail .",
    "it is based on a full bosonization formulation known as the phase string representation@xcite of the t - j model , in which the whole nontrivial sign structure is explicitly captured by a topological ( mutual statistical ) gauge structure .",
    "then we show that such a formalism under the no double occupancy constraint leads to the introduction of the two - component spinons in order to adequately describe the microscopically distinctive superexchange and hopping processes .",
    "such a new exact formulation provides a precise starting point that naturally results in an electron - fractionalized description of the superconducting ground state at a finite doping , and a highly accurate bosonic rvb description of the afm correlation in the zero doping limit .",
    "an effective theory of the elementary excitations is also obtained within the same framework .",
    "finally , the conclusion and perspective are presented in sec .",
    "we present this section to summarize the key equations / results of the present work , which basically addresses the issue how the ground state of a heisenberg antiferromagnet / mott insulator can be turned into a superconducting ground state by doping .      for comparison ,",
    "let us start with the gutzwiller - projected bcs state ansatz , proposed@xcite for the t - j hamiltonian on a 2d square lattice , given by @xmath1where @xmath2-@xmath3 denotes an ordinary d - wave bcs state and @xmath4 is a gutzwiller projection operator enforcing the following no double occupancy constraint    @xmath5    because of @xmath6 , the cooper pairing in @xmath2-@xmath7 reduces to the neutralized rvb pairing@xcite at half - filling , whereas at finite doping the cooper and rvb pairings are not explicitly distinguished , as schematically illustrated in fig . 1 .",
    "by contrast , the superconducting ground state obtained in the present work may be formally written as@xmath8 in which @xmath9 denotes a _",
    "neutral _ spin background that always remains half - filled as a mott insulator , whereas the cooper pairs  associated with the doped holes are created by annihilating @xmath10 electrons from @xmath9 , which are in singlet , d - wave pairing with an amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "apparently such a superconducting state automatically satisfies the no double occupancy constraint without invoking the gutzwiller projection @xmath6 as in eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) .",
    "in particular , it is distinguished from eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) by an explicit separation of the cooper pairing and rvb pairing at finite doping .",
    "schematically the rvb pairing in @xmath9 and the cooper pairing in @xmath12 are illustrated in figs .",
    "2(a ) , and 2(b ) as well as 2(c ) , respectively .",
    "one easily sees the distinction between the neutral rvb pairing in fig .",
    "2(a ) and the cooper pairing in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) .",
    "in the latter , a pair of holes are involved , in which each hole will be generally associated with a spin via an rvb amplitude [ the blue - colored bond in fig .",
    "2(b ) ] , since the hole is created by annihilating a spin whose rvb partner already pre - exists in @xmath9 .",
    "note that the holes are mobile here and thus their spin partners are also automatically changing with the hopping .",
    "two spin partners associated with a cooper pair in fig .",
    "2(b ) can become rvb - paired again to further gain the superexchange energy , which results in the configuration shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) and serves the driving force for the cooper pairing . in this sense , the superexchange / rvb pairing provides the ultimate pairing glue  for superconductivity .",
    "with the cooper and neutral rvb channels being explicitly differentiated in eq .",
    "( [ scgs-0 ] ) , generally some nontrivial phase shift effect will emerge , as introduced by @xmath13 . specifically , @xmath13 is given by@xmath14where @xmath15 denotes the hole occupation number at site @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is a bosonic wavefunction symmetric with regard to the hole coordinates @xmath18 , which is generally present to ensure gauge invariance of the phase shift fields . here",
    "the phase shifts @xmath19 associated with the holes , will directly act on the ghost  spin liquid state @xmath9 to monitor the background spin correlations .",
    "in other words , @xmath13 represents an entanglement  between these two channels whose physical implications and mathematical definition are to be shown below .      due to the presence of @xmath13 , injecting a hole into the ground state @xmath20 will generally induce a phase shift by @xmath21thus the wavefunction overlap between the bare hole state and the true ground state of @xmath22 holes crucially depends on @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , by noting that the cooper pairing amplitude already pre - exists via @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ scgs-0 ] ) , the superconducting off - diagonal - long - range - order ( odlro ) is essentially determined by ( see below ) @xmath24hence the superconducting phase coherence and the coherence of a landau ( or more precisely , bogoliubov ) quasiparticle will be simultaneously realized .",
    "in other words , a normal stateobtained by disordering the phase shift factor @xmath23 will be intrinsically a non fermi liquid with a vanishing quasiparticle weight .    in the following we provide a simple proof of eq .",
    "( [ phcoh-0 ] ) by taking @xmath25 in @xmath13 without loss of generality .",

    "( d-0 ) represents that the cooper pairing amplitude is formed ( with the pairing symmetry determined by @xmath11 ) .",
    "the true superconducting odlro , @xmath36 , is thus indeed determined by the phase coherence condition in eq .",

    "then each spin in @xmath9 will contribute to a @xmath51 vortex via @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ phif ] ) with itself sitting at the vortex core .",
    "vice versa , each doped hole will be perceived by the spins in @xmath53 as introducing a @xmath54 vortex , also via @xmath55 , with the hole sitting at the core .",
    "it implies that a doped hole and a neutral spin satisfy a mutual semion statistics  as the phase shift @xmath39 amounts to giving rise to @xmath51 when one kind of species continuously circles around the other one once .",
    "note that the single - valueness of eq .",
    "( [ phif ] ) will be ensured by combining with @xmath56 .",
    "thus the total phase shift added up in @xmath13 represents a nontrivial entanglement between the doped holes and background spins , which will decide a mutual semion statistics  sign structure in @xmath12 that is fundamentally different from that of a bcs state satisfying the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "one may examine such a sign structure by a thinking experiment in which a hole in @xmath12 goes through a closed loop @xmath57 at each step of nearest - neighbor moving of the hole , a singular phase @xmath58 or @xmath59 is generated via a phase shift @xmath39 in @xmath13 depending on @xmath60 or @xmath61 spin that the hole exchanges  with .",
    "note that @xmath62 also produces other phase shift contributed by other spins not exchanged  with the hole , but their effect disappears after counting the total berry s phase acquired by the closed - path motion of the hole .",
    "in the end , one finds @xmath63 in which @xmath64 only counts the total number of the @xmath65-spins that the hole has exchanged  with along the loop @xmath66 on a square lattice .",

    "this effect is proven to be dynamically irreparable and is thus of statistics nature .",

    "the present mechanism for superconductivity resembles , by nature , what has been proposed by anderson@xcite that the spin rvb pairing is turned into the cooper pairing upon doping .",
    "but the basic structure of the superconducting ground state , presented in eq .",
    "( [ scgs-0 ] ) , is distinct from the original proposal@xcite of the gutzwiller - projected bcs state in eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) by that the neutral rvb and cooper channels remain clearly differentiated throughout the underdoped superconducting regime , as illustrated by figs .",
    "[ fig.2 ] and [ fig.1 ] , respectively .",
    "such a ground state has intrinsically embedded three essential types of correlations : i.e. , the afm correlations in @xmath9 ; the cooper pairing of the doped holes ; and a mutual influence / competition between the two channels via a mutual statistical phase in @xmath13 .",
    "consequently the superconductivity arises as a self - organization from these correlations , rather than by default as in a gutzwiller - projected bcs state at finite doping . without holes ,",
    "the long - range afm order will always win in @xmath9 , which provides a highly accurate description of the ground state of the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "but a sufficient concentration of doped holes will eventually turn the antiferromagnetism in @xmath283 into a true  spin liquid state with short - range afm correlations . and by doing so the cooper paired holes can gain phase coherence to realize a high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "the key underlying such peculiar structure in the ground state can be attributed to the singular phase shift introduced by the doped holes , which is incorporated in eq .",
    "( [ scgs-0 ] ) by @xmath13 .",
    "such a phase string  effect  induced by the hole hopping is irreparable , representing the exact sign structure of the t - j model in the no double occupancy constrained hilbert space , which appears as mutual statistical signs drastically different from the fermi - dirac statistical signs .",
    "incorporating this new emergent statistics@xcite is thus essential in order to correctly understand the non fermi liquid nature of doped mott insulators .",
    "correspondingly there are three distinctive types of elementary excitations .",
    "firstly , the short - range rvb correlations in @xmath9 are reflected by a _",
    "finite _ energy gap @xmath183 opened up in a neutral spin excitation , called a spin - roton , which only reduces to the gapless spin wave in an afm state with a long - range rvb pairing , e.g. , at half - filling .",
    "such a characteristic @xmath183 will protect the superconducting phase coherence from phase disordering effect , caused by @xmath13 that closely monitors the neutral spin correlations in @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , it determines@xcite a unique @xmath0 formula ( [ tc ] ) . secondly , the fermionic excitations related to breaking up the cooper pairs in eq .",
    "( scgs-0 ) are called backflow spinons ( @xmath107-spinons ) as they carry well - defined spins and are therefore also contribute to spin excitations .",
    "such backflow spinon excitations will constitute a lower branch of spin excitations , below @xmath183 , as the size of the cooper pairing is usually larger than that of the rvb pairing .",
    "thirdly , the @xmath107-spinon is distinct from a conventional bogoliubov particle by a singularphase shift factor @xmath390 .",
    "although the phase coherence @xmath391 in the superconducting phase can make the @xmath107-spinon show up in the single - particle channel around the antinodal regime , the local singular fluctuations of @xmath390 will in addition induce a new collective mode as a bound state of the fractionalized particles around the nodal regime .",
    "it is nothing but a conventional bogoliubov nodal quasiparticle .",
    "some additional unconventional properties can be inferred in such a d - wave superconductor . in the spin channel ,",
    "two branches of spin excitations near @xmath392 , @xmath393 separated by a resonancelike energy scale @xmath394 are responsible by the spin rotons ( upper branch ) and @xmath107-spinons ( lower branch ) , respectively .",
    "in particular , strong magnetic fields should affect the lower - branch first via the zeeman effect , which can eventually destroy the pairing of the @xmath107-spinons and thus the superconducting order parameter , leading to small fermi pockets formed by the fermionic @xmath107-spinons ; on the other hand , in the single - particle channel , a dichotomy of bogoliubov quasiparticle and the @xmath107-spinon coherent peaks can appear simultaneously in the superconducting phase in the nodal and antinodal regions , respectively .",
    "but the latter should disappear in the single - electron spectral function once the phase of the superconducting order parameter is thermally disordered by spin excitations in @xmath9 , where each excited spinon in @xmath9 automatically induces a current vortex via @xmath390 , forming a spinon - vortex and proliferating in a quantum vortex liquid state@xcite ; furthermore , in the presence of weak magnetic fields , the cooper pairing of doped holes provides a small phase stiffness @xmath395 at @xmath219 .",
    "but @xmath396 will be thermally reduced by the bogoliubov nodal quasiparticles which couple to the external  electromagnetic fields with a full electric charge , leading to @xmath397 @xmath398 with @xmath399 obviously all of these will have strong experimental implications .",

    "( [ heff ] ) resembles the so - called two - fluid models , which have been phenomenologically proposed for the cuprate superconductors@xcite and iron - based superconductorsklw_09 based on different theoretical considerations .",
    "the main similarity with these approaches lies in that there exist both an itinerant bcs - type component ( i.e. , @xmath95 in the present case ) and a localized spin liquid component ( i.e. , @xmath9 here ) .",
    "the main distinction lies in how the local spin liquid component is mathematically characterized : the full description of it in the present approach is actually given by @xmath400 , which is described by a mutual chern - simons gauge model [ eq .",
