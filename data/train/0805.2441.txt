    "the hot gas in galaxy clusters loses energy by x - ray emission but does not cool to low temperatures . in recent attempts to solve this cooling flow problem",
    "it has been almost exclusively assumed that feedback energy from accretion onto cluster - centered massive black holes can be delivered to the hot gas in a manner that maintains the observed temperature and density profiles in spite of radiation losses . the solution to this problem",
    "is not straightforward . even when heat is supplied to the cluster gas in an",
    "_ ad hoc _ , optimized , ideally fine - tuned manner , either concentrated or distributed over many tens of kiloparsecs , it is found that the temperature and density profiles deviate strongly from those observed ( brighenti & mathews 2002 ; 2003 ) .",
    "for example , highly idealized flows in which radiative cooling is perfectly balanced by local heating at every radius are inconsistent with the secular increase in gas density associated with stellar mass loss in the cluster - centered galaxy . in most galaxy groups and clusters a positive temperature gradient ( @xmath1 )",
    "is observed in the inner regions . since the coolest",
    "gas is closest to the central source of agn heating , this central gas must be heated with exquisite precision ( on short timescales ) to maintain the low temperatures observed .    in spite of these difficulties , a variety of heating mechanisms",
    "continue to be investigated to understand the energetics of hot cluster gas .",
    "heating is usually assumed to be associated with the formation of x - ray cavities by jet feedback energy proceeding from the central black hole .",
    "weak shock waves emerge when the cluster gas is displaced as cavities form ( see mcnamara & nulsen 2007 for a review ) .",
    "weak shocks , observed in a few clusters ( e.g. perseus : fabian et al 2003 ; virgo : forman et al . 2005 ; 2007 ) , have the desirable capability of dissipating agn feedback energy over large regions of the cluster gas , as emphasized by fabian et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , energy dissipation by outwardly propagating shock or sound waves is disproportionally concentrated in the central regions of clusters where the gas density gradient is smallest . over time",
    "the cumulative wave dissipation in this central gas ( through which all the waves must pass ) causes its temperature to become hotter than observed in any cluster ( fujita & suzuki 2005 ; mathews , faltenbacher & brighenti 2006 ) . it may be possible to forestall cooling in a limited region of a particular cluster with a proper choice of shock mach numbers ( or sound wave frequencies and amplitudes ) , but this level of fine - tuning seems contrived .",
    "x - ray cavities are thought to provide a convenient measure of the amount of feedback power delivered to the hot gas .",
    "cavities are observed in @xmath2% of x - ray bright clusters ( birzan et al .",
    "2004 ; rafferty et al .",
    "2006 ) , but the incidence of cavities increases as the cooling time of the central gas decreases ( dunn & fabian 2006 ) . the work done in displacing a volume @xmath3 of cluster gas at pressure @xmath4 is @xmath5 and the energy of the material inside the cavity is @xmath6 .",
    "this corresponds to a total cavity energy of @xmath7pv = 4pv$ ] where @xmath8 is often chosen because many ( young ) cavities are filled with radio synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and there is little or no observable evidence for hot thermal gas inside cavities ( e.g. mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) .    assuming that the local buoyancy time @xmath9 in the cluster gas is a measure of the cavity lifetime , rafferty et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimate the `` cavity jet power '' @xmath10 rafferty et al .",
    "find that @xmath11 exceeds the total x - ray luminosity @xmath12 within the cooling radius ( defined where the cooling time is 7.7 gyrs ) in about 60% of their sample clusters with cavities .",
    "they suggest that clusters with @xmath13  and the many clusters with no known cavities  are in a phase of their feedback energy cycle that is just now recovering from a recent heating episode .",
    "rafferty et al .",
    "suggest that all the energy within the cavities @xmath6 may be available to heat the cluster gas , not just the @xmath5 work done by the expanding cavity .",
    "this implies that the ( thermal ) energy of material within the cavity is ultimately shared with the cluster gas .",
    "furthermore , for those clusters in which the total cavity jet power is favorable ( @xmath14 ) , it is assumed that this energy is distributed throughout the cluster gas in a manner that preserves the characteristic gas temperature and density profiles observed in galaxy clusters .",
    "implicit in this assumed energy distribution is the requirement that the cavity - forming energy is delivered to the cluster gas in an approximately isotropic manner relative to the central black hole .",
    "another less often considered possible resolution to the cooling flow problem is the hypothesis that gas is only heated at or near the central black hole and then is buoyantly transported far out into the cluster gas , i.e. a circulation flow ( mathews et al . 2003 ; 2004 ) .",
    "one of the initial motivations for mass circulation was the two - temperature ( and therefore buoyant ) flow observed in the galaxy group ngc 5044 ( buote et al .",
    "however , temi , brighenti & mathews ( 2007a , b ) have recently found far - infrared emission from dust extending out to 5 - 10 kpc around many group - centered , x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies . since",
    "the dust lifetime to sputtering destruction in the hot gas is only @xmath15 yrs , this observation provides additional strong evidence for ongoing buoyant outflow from dust - rich cores in the central galaxies .",
    "additional support for buoyant outflow is provided by the large regions of iron enrichment in the hot gas surrounding cluster - centered elliptical galaxies ( de grandi et al .",
    "since the 50 - 100 kpc size of these regions enriched by type ia supernovae greatly exceeds that of the central galaxy where they occur , an outward mass transfer is essential for their formation .",
    "buoyant outflow is desirable since it can also preserve the observed gas density and temperature profiles ( mathews et al .",
    "alternatively , these profiles can be preserved if mass circulates outward in momentum - driven , mass - carrying jets ( brighenti & mathews 2006 ) .    in most theoretical studies of x - ray cavity evolution",
    ", it is assumed that the cavities are inflated with ultra - hot gas ( occasionally but not always with @xmath8 ) ( e.g. brggen & kaiser 2002 ; reynolds et al .",
    "2005 ; gardini 2007 ; pavlovski et al .",
    "if this heated gas is transported in jets from the central black hole , then this type of solution implicitly requires an outward mass circulation which in some simulations can be quite large .",
    "for example , in the recent double jet 3d calculation of heinz et al . ( 2006 ) , jets with power @xmath16 ergs s@xmath17 enter the cluster gas from the origin with velocity @xmath18 km s@xmath17 .",
    "this translates into a mass flux of @xmath19 @xmath20 yr@xmath17 and a total injected mass of @xmath21 @xmath20 over their @xmath22 year computation .",
    "if ambient cluster gas is entrained in the jets , the outflowing mass could be increased further .",
    "the jet mass flux may be very much less if most of their energy density is in the form of cosmic rays . while it is possible that jets do transport substantial masses of gas from the center ( as in brighenti & mathews 2006 )",
    ", we explore here the energetics in the limiting case in which x - ray cavities are formed only with relativistic cosmic rays that can also diffuse into the cluster gas . for simplicity",
    "we assume that most of the cosmic rays in cavities arrive in jets and are not produced in local shocks . in this limit",
    "the cavities are formed with pure energy with no appreciable component of rest mass or momentum as in previous numerical simulations .",
    "because of their diffusive nature , cosmic rays can eventually penetrate the cluster gas and contribute to the local pressure support . as a consequence",
    "the local cluster gas density is reduced by cosmic rays and becomes buoyant .",
    "inhomogeneously distributed cosmic rays are a natural driver of buoyant mass outflow .",
    "gas carried out by cosmic ray buoyancy may never return to the cluster center .",
    "however , we find that few cosmic rays move beyond the cooling radius , so the cluster gas expands and cools globally .",
    "although some heating is expected from shock waves , this heating is offset by the global cooling .",
    "consequently , x - ray cavities containing cosmic rays result in a net cooling of the cluster gas , not heating as generally assumed .",
    "buoyant mass outflow resulting from inhomogeneous cosmic rays and global expansion of the cluster gas may help to resolve the cooling flow puzzle .",
    "although it is generally believed that x - ray cavities are formed with cosmic rays , this conjecture has only recently been tested with detailed calculations ( mathews & brighenti 2007a , b ) . however , spherical steady state cluster flows including cosmic rays ( e.g. bhringer & morfill 1988 ; loewenstein et al .",
    "1991 ) have been developed to explore the possible large scale dynamical influence of cosmic ray pressure gradients and the dissipation of their energy into the thermal gas .",
    "for simplicity in this initial treatment of the global time - dependent energetics of cluster cavity formation with cosmic rays , we do not specify the physical nature of the relativistic fluid ( electrons or protons ) nor do we calculate radio or inverse compton fluxes / luminosities which would require additional assumed parameters  these important details will be considered in future papers . nevertheless , the spatial distribution of cosmic rays we calculate defines the region where radio emission could be expected .",
    "since we do not consider coulomb heating , the cluster gas responds adiabatically to cosmic ray pressure gradients .",
    "the combined eulerian evolution of ( relativistic ) cosmic rays ( crs ) and thermal gas can be described with the following four equations : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where we suppress artificial viscosity terms .",
    "pressures and thermal energy densities in the plasma and cosmic rays are related respectively by @xmath27 and @xmath28 where we assume @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the cosmic ray dynamics are described by @xmath31 , the integrated energy density over the cosmic ray energy or momentum distribution , @xmath32 .",
    "the first three equations are the usual equations for conservation of mass , momentum and thermal energy in the hot thermal cluster gas .",
    "we do not include optically thin radiative losses since our intention here is to study the energetics of cavity creation alone without the complicating effects of a secular radiative energy loss and central cooling .",
    "note that the cr pressure gradient in equation 2 contributes to the motion of the thermal gas .",
    "this exchange of momentum between crs and gas arises as the crs diffuse through magnetic irregularities ( alfven waves ) that are nearly frozen into the hot thermal gas .",
    "however , magnetic terms do not explicitly enter in the equations because typical magnetic fields in cluster gas @xmath33 g ( govoni & feretti 2004 ) are too small , i.e. the magnetic energy densities @xmath34 erg @xmath35 are generally much less than the thermal energy density in the hot gas .",
    "in addition , the alfven velocity @xmath36 km s@xmath17 is typically much less than the sound or flow speeds in cluster gas so the alfven velocity of the magnetic scatterers can be ignored ( e.g. drury & falle 1986 , jones & kang , 1990 ) .    equation 4 above describes both the advection of crs with the gas and their diffusion through the gas .",
    "a mass conservation equation for the crs is unnecessary because of their negligible rest mass .",
    "the cr diffusion coefficient @xmath37 is difficult or impossible to calculate in the absence of detailed information about the magnetic field topology which is currently unknown .",
    "however , we expect that @xmath37 may vary inversely with the density of the thermal gas , assuming that the magnetic field strength also scales with density . for simplicity",
    "we ignore for now any dependence of @xmath37 on cr particle momentum .",
    "since observed radio lobes are very approximately spherical , we assume that @xmath37 is isotropic , consistent with a highly irregular global magnetic field . for these preliminary calculations it is not necessary to specify the cr composition , either electrons or protons can dominate as long as they are relativistic .",
    "finally , we assume that the total cr energy density is not substantially reduced by losses due to synchrotron emission or interactions with ambient photons or thermal particles during the cavity evolution time .",
    "dissipation of cosmic ray energy into the thermal gas is probably not important in x - ray cavities since the gas temperature in the cavity rims is in fact relatively cooler .",
    "the set of equations above are solved in ( @xmath38 ) cylindrical coordinates using a 2d code very similar to zeus 2d ( stone & norman 1992 ) . to be specific , we study the evolution of x - ray cavities in the well - observed virgo cluster using the analytic fits to the observed gas temperature and density profiles suggested by ghizzardi et al .",
    "the computational grid consists of 100 equally spaced zones in both coordinates out to 50 kpc plus an additional 100 zones in both coordinates that increase in size logarithmically out to @xmath39 mpc .",
    "we adopt reflection boundary conditions for gas and cosmic rays at the origin and , in view of the large computational domain , also at the outer grid boundary .",
    "we assume a spherical gravitational field @xmath40 that establishes exact initial hydrostatic equilibrium for the virgo cluster gas pressure gradient .",
    "the cosmic ray diffusion term in equation 4 is solved using implicit crank - nicolson differencing . while this differencing scheme is stable for all time steps ,",
    "we restrict each time step by the stability condition for explicitly - differenced diffusion as well as the courant condition for numerical stability .",
    "shocks are treated with a standard artificial viscosity .",
    "we assume that the x - ray cavity is formed by crs that propagate in a non - thermal jet from the central black hole ( agn ) to some fixed radius .",
    "the crs are deposited in a gaussian - shaped sphere of characteristic radius @xmath41 kpc located at @xmath42 , i.e. 10 kpc along the @xmath43-axis .",
    "the cr source term in equation 4 is therefore @xmath44 when @xmath45 .",
    "the integral of @xmath46 over space is unity .    in the calculations described below our principal objective is to explore the unique diffusive effects of cosmic rays on cavity formation and energetics .",
    "we therefore restrict the total cr energy of all calculations to @xmath47 ergs and adopt @xmath48 yrs as the cr injection time .",
    "we choose @xmath49 to be consistent with x - ray cavity observations ; it is shorter than the local buoyancy time in the cluster gas but sufficiently long not to produce strong shocks which are not commonly observed . at times",
    "@xmath50 when @xmath51 , the total cr energy @xmath52 over the grid volume remains very nearly constant but changes slightly due to advection in adiabatic compressions or rarefactions .",
    "since the cr diffusion coefficient is poorly known at present  and may vary from one agn event to another  we consider a wide range of density - dependent coefficients , @xmath53 in general , for reasons discussed above , we assume that the cr diffusion @xmath37 varies inversely with cluster gas density . but @xmath37 must be sufficiently large so that the cr density is approximately uniform in the x - ray cavities where the cluster gas density is lowest , i.e. we assume that crs also diffuse inside the cavity .",
    "for example when @xmath47 ergs we find that the maximum cavity radius is @xmath54 kpc so we require that @xmath37 in the cavities be at least @xmath55 @xmath56s@xmath17 and this condition is ensured by our adopted @xmath57 above . in regions of higher @xmath58 the density parameter",
    "@xmath59 determines the cr diffusion coefficient . in",
    "the following we consider @xmath60 @xmath35",
    ". the largest cr diffusion coefficient @xmath37 ( corresponding to @xmath61 ) is similar to that required by mathews & brighenti ( 2007b ) to explain a common age ( @xmath22 yrs ) for the large radio lobes and the cavity jet ( thermal filament ) observed by forman et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in the virgo cluster .",
    "figure 1 shows the gas density @xmath62 and cosmic ray energy density @xmath63 at six times during the evolution of an x - ray cavity and its cosmic ray ( radio ) lobe . in figure 1 @xmath64",
    "@xmath35 so the diffusion coefficient is rather large , but identical to that used by mathews & brighenti ( 2007b ) to describe the evolution of the cavity jet ( thermal filament ) in m87/virgo .",
    "the cavity in figure 1 is formed 10 kpc along the ( horizontal ) @xmath43-axis during time @xmath65 gyr . at time",
    "@xmath66 gyr , shortly following @xmath49 , the cosmic rays ( dotted contours ) are tightly confined inside the cavity . by time",
    "@xmath67 gyr the cosmic rays have diffused through the cavity walls forming a small radio lobe and the cavity has just disappeared  we define the cavity as that region where the plasma density is lower than the original virgo density by at least a factor 1/3 .",
    "a small vortex at @xmath68 kpc is visible at this time . during the first three times shown in figure 1 a ( relatively cooler ) thermal feature ( the `` cavity jet '' )",
    "is seen to rise along the @xmath43-axis .",
    "the evolution of this feature is described in detail in mathews & brighenti ( 2007b ) and we will not repeat that discussion again here . during the three later times in figure 1 the denser parts of the cavity jet have fallen back toward the center of virgo and the hot gas dynamics become more quiescent .",
    "however , the cosmic rays are seen to diffuse into a progressively larger region elongated along the @xmath43-axis .",
    "although not apparent in the gas density contours , there is a net outward buoyant migration of the gas in the region occupied by the cosmic rays ( the radio lobe ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the cavity evolution when the cosmic ray diffusion is 1000 times lower ( when @xmath69 @xmath35 ) but with all other parameters unchanged .",
    "now the cosmic rays are seen to be very tightly confined to the cavity region until at least time 0.1 gyr when the cavity is still visible . in this evolution",
    "the outer parts of the cavity break away forming a vortex that migrates away from the @xmath43-axis , carrying its own cosmic rays .",
    "by time 0.3 gyr the brightest parts of the radio image ( corresponding to the largest cosmic ray energy density ) should consist of two separate regions , a feature along the @xmath43-axis extending out to 40 kpc and the vortex at @xmath70 kpc . at this time ( 0.3 gyr )",
    "we see an enhanced gas density that accompanies the cosmic rays along the @xmath43-axis . at still later times",
    "the cosmic rays continue to reside mostly along the @xmath43-axis but by time 0.9 gyr a region of low cosmic ray energy density becomes visible in the @xmath71-direction along the trajectory of the receding vortex ( now at @xmath72 kpc ) .    when x - ray cavities are formed in an atmosphere initially at rest , as we assume here , the vortex region at time 0.3 gyr in figure 2 would appear as a ring when viewed along the @xmath43-axis . to our knowledge",
    "no ring - shaped radio features have been observed .",
    "this could simply be due to the faintness of such regions since radio - synchrotron electrons tend to not to produce observable ghz emission after about @xmath22 yrs .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from figures 1 and 2 that the radio lobe morphology can in principle provide valuable information concerning the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient about which very little is known at present .",
    "finally , since gas phase metal abundances tend to increase toward the centers of clusters , regions of enhanced abundance are expected to accompany the outward buoyant migration of cosmic rays .    as a further aid in interpreting figures 1 and 2 ,",
    "figure 3 shows the pressure profiles along the @xmath43-axis at four times for both evolutionary calculations . at early times",
    "the cavity is visible as the region where @xmath73 . within the cavity",
    "the pressure gradient ( @xmath74 ) is nearly flat because of the enormous pressure scale height of the relativistic fluid .",
    "however , except near and within the cavities , the total pressure @xmath75 ( dotted lines ) deviates very little from the pressure profile in the cluster before the cavity was introduced ( dot - dashed lines ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the largely subsonic character of the flows .",
    "after about 0.1 gyrs in both calculations the cosmic rays diffuse sufficiently so that the pressure ratio @xmath76 , the current threshold of @xmath77-ray detectability of cosmic ray protons if nearby clusters are completely filled with cosmic rays ( pfrommer & ensslin et al .",
    "although the cosmic ray pressure and energy density are negligible at these late times , we show below that cosmic rays continue to displace about the same volume of gas .",
    "this results in a very long - lasting global expansion of cluster gas that can be seen by the small discrepancies in the @xmath43-axis gas pressure profile ( solid lines ) relative to that in the initial cluster ( dash - dotted lines ) at times 0.3 gyrs in figure 3 .",
    "nevertheless , the close similarity of the initial and final gas pressure along the @xmath43-axis ( and elsewhere ) at late times is consistent with our finding that the gas density and temperature ( and therefore entropy ) gradients are also only slightly affected by the cavity evolution .",
    "figure 4 shows the evolution of cluster gas energies resulting from cavity - lobe formation with cosmic rays .",
    "the four panels show the evolution as the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient @xmath37 decreases with @xmath59 ( in @xmath35 ) over a wide range : @xmath64 ( panel @xmath78 ) , @xmath79 ( panel @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 ( panel @xmath82 ) , and @xmath83 ( panel @xmath84 ) .",
    "the total cosmic ray energy integrated over the entire computational region @xmath52 is shown with long dashed lines .",
    "@xmath85 is seen to rise until @xmath86 yrs as the cavities form , then remain approximately constant after the cosmic ray source is turned off .",
    "@xmath87 is not a strictly conserved energy .",
    "the small decrease in @xmath85 visible at times @xmath50 can occur if the cosmic ray energy density is reduced by a secular advective expansion with the cluster gas .",
    "this decrease in @xmath85 after @xmath49 is stronger when @xmath37 is smaller ( panels @xmath88 ) since the cosmic rays are more confined near the @xmath43-axis where most of the gas expansion occurs .",
    "the ( small ) total kinetic energy in the cluster gas @xmath89 is shown with dotted lines in each panel . the change in potential energy compared to the initial virgo atmosphere , @xmath90 dv$ ]",
    "is shown with short dashed lines .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath91 is found from the initial m87/virgo atmosphere by integrating @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the radial coordinate .",
    "the change in the total gas thermal energy relative to the original atmosphere @xmath94 dv$ ] is shown with ( the lower ) solid lines in each panel .",
    "finally the dash - dotted line shows the total energy @xmath95 which is constant after time @xmath96 to an excellent approximation and is equal to @xmath97 ergs as expected .",
    "also shown in each panel of figure 4 is an approximate evaluation of the quantity @xmath98 where @xmath3 is the volume of the x - ray cavity at any time ( arbitrarily defined as the sum over all grid zone volumes in which the gas density is less than @xmath99 ) and @xmath4 is an estimate of the average pressure in the ( sometimes non - contiguous ) zones containing the cavity . when cosmic rays are strongly trapped within the cavity , we expect @xmath100 . in panel @xmath78 of figure 4",
    "we see that @xmath101 which can be expected for larger @xmath37 when cosmic rays diffuse through the cavity walls .",
    "however , @xmath102 is apparent in panels @xmath82 and @xmath84 , although @xmath98 never exceeds @xmath97 ergs by more than about 20% .",
    "this may be due to our rather approximate estimate of @xmath4 and @xmath3 or it may be a real inertial overshoot just after the cavity is formed . in any case , we include @xmath103 in figure 4 because this is the cluster gas heating energy proposed by rafferty et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and mcnamara & nulsen ( 2007 ) in their discussions of cavity energetics .",
    "figure 5 shows the approximate evolution of the cavity radius @xmath104 and its mean radius in the cluster @xmath105 .",
    "the cavity radius is found from the estimated cavity volume @xmath3 by assuming that the cavity is spherical , @xmath106 .",
    "the four lines for @xmath107 and @xmath108 in figure 5 correspond to the four cosmic ray diffusivities @xmath37 as it decreases in each panel in figure 4 : @xmath78 , dotted line ; @xmath80 , short dashed line ; @xmath82 , long dashed line ; @xmath84 , solid line .",
    "the buoyant trajectory of the cavities @xmath105 is independent of @xmath37 , but the cavities progress further along @xmath105 when @xmath37 is smaller .",
    "the cavity lifetime is determined when @xmath109 .",
    "notice that the cavity lifetimes are similar for @xmath110 ( long dashed line ) , and @xmath111 ( solid line ) , suggesting that the cavity evolution would not change much if @xmath59 ( and therefore @xmath37 ) were reduced further .",
    "the main result we wish to emphasize is the evolution of the cluster gas thermal energy @xmath112 . at early times during cavity formation",
    "when @xmath113 , @xmath114 increases because of heating due to the weak shock that propagates away from the expanding cavity .",
    "this initial shock heating increases as @xmath37 decreases ( panels @xmath88 in figure 4 ) because ( for fixed @xmath115 and @xmath49 ) the shock strength increases when cosmic rays are more confined within the cavity .",
    "this is consistent with the 1d cavity evolution described by mathews & brighenti ( 2007a ) .",
    "however , after the cavity is formed ( @xmath116 ) @xmath112 decreases and becomes negative after @xmath117 yrs .",
    "we see in figure 4 that the final energy separation between @xmath114 and @xmath118 is independent of @xmath37 .",
    "also notice that in each panel of figure 4 the average final value of the energy change @xmath119 is not zero , but is approximately equal to the peak thermal energy acquired from the shock , @xmath120 .",
    "although the total energy change in the cluster @xmath121 increases as @xmath37 decreases , the cluster gas experiences a net cooling ( @xmath122 ) when cavities are formed with cosmic rays .",
    "this global cooling is exactly opposite to the results discussed by other authors in which cavity formation is regarded as an important source of agn heating required to balance radiative losses in the cluster gas and reduce central cooling in cooling flows .",
    "the energy evolutions shown in figure 4 are not qualitatively altered when the total cavity energy @xmath115 is increased .",
    "for example when @xmath123 ergs ( deposited at @xmath124 kpc in time @xmath86 yrs with @xmath111 @xmath35 ) all energies are larger but the proportions are similar to those in figure 4 .",
    "although the shock is stronger in this case , so is the buoyant cooling and @xmath114 still becomes negative after @xmath125 yrs .",
    "the maximum equivalent spherical radius of this high energy cavity is about @xmath126 kpc at @xmath127 , but the cavity disappears soon afterward at @xmath128 when @xmath129 kpc .",
    "more energetic cavities are bigger and more buoyant , but do nt last proportionally longer .",
    "to verify that the cluster gas has in fact undergone a net expansion as a result of cavity formation , we computed the evolution of the cumulative gas mass distribution @xmath130 .",
    "first we sorted the computational zones in cylindrical coordinates in order of increasing spherical radius @xmath93 then we integrated over the 7855 sorted zones within @xmath131 kpc to determine @xmath130 .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath130 in ( one hemisphere of ) the initial cluster ( @xmath132 ) and after @xmath133 gyr for two limiting values of @xmath37 ( @xmath64 and @xmath83 @xmath35 ) .",
    "to more clearly illustrate the evolution of @xmath130 most of the @xmath134-variation in figure 6 has been removed by plotting @xmath135 .",
    "the noise in these plots of @xmath130 arises because of the finite number of computational grid zones .",
    "figure 6 clearly shows that mass has been removed from the inner regions of the cluster as a result of cavity formation , i.e. the cluster gas has experienced a net expansion .",
    "this expansion is remarkably insensitive to the cosmic ray diffusivity @xmath37 , particularly at @xmath136 kpc .",
    "the evolution of @xmath130 is expected to depend both on the cavity energy @xmath115 and the location of the initial cavity in the cluster gas ( 10 kpc in our case ) .",
    "the largest radius plotted in figure 6 , @xmath131 kpc , is essentially the cooling radius for the cluster , i.e. the radius where the local cooling time is 7.4 gyrs , which is comparable to the cluster age . from this plot",
    "we estimate that @xmath137 @xmath20 has been removed from within 10 kpc for both values of @xmath59 . at @xmath131 kpc",
    "the mass outflow is @xmath138 @xmath20 ( for @xmath64 ) and @xmath139 @xmath20 ( for @xmath111 ) .",
    "values of @xmath140 refer to the total cluster mass flow in both hemispheres , assuming that a pair of cavities are produced by symmetric double jets .",
    "using the ghizzardi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) density and temperature profiles for virgo , we estimate a feedback - free gas cooling rate of @xmath141 .",
    "therefore if cavities similar to the one we calculate here are formed with cosmic rays every @xmath142 yrs , this could result in a mass outflow at @xmath131 kpc equal to the cooling inflow at @xmath143 from radiation losses .",
    "when @xmath123 ergs the total mass flowing beyond 50 kpc after time 0.9 gyr is much larger , @xmath144 @xmath20 .",
    "( note that the buoyant mass outflow scales with @xmath115 , but the cavity lifetime does not . ) successive cavities in virgo with @xmath123 erg appearing every @xmath145 years could balance the mass flow from radiative cooling @xmath141 and also be consistent with the current absence of large cavities in m87/virgo .",
    "of course an expansion outflow at the cooling radius comparable to the steady state cooling rate @xmath146 does not in itself shut down radiative cooling near the cluster center , but the cooling radius will become larger and the cooling time at every radius will increase due to the slightly lower gas density resulting from the global expansion .",
    "the post - cavity mass flow has two aspects : ( 1 ) an increase in @xmath118 in figure 4 and non - zero @xmath147 in figure 6 that result from the global lifting that occurs when a new cavity is formed , and ( 2 ) a mass circulation driven near the @xmath43-axis by buoyant gas containing cosmic rays .",
    "we discuss each in turn .",
    "although gas certainly flows beyond @xmath131 kpc in all our cavity evolutions , the fraction of total cosmic ray energy within this radius @xmath148 varies .",
    "for example , at @xmath133 gyr and large @xmath37 ( @xmath64 @xmath35 ) , the cosmic ray energy in @xmath149 kpc , @xmath150 ergs , is less than the total cosmic ray energy on the computational grid , @xmath151 ergs . in this case",
    "about 20% of the cosmic rays have moved beyond 50 kpc . for smaller @xmath37 ( @xmath64 @xmath152 ) after this same time we find that @xmath153 ergs is identical to the total energy @xmath87 , i.e. almost all cosmic rays are confined within 50 kpc .",
    "( both @xmath154 and @xmath87 refer to a single hemisphere . )",
    "however , the mass @xmath147 flowing across @xmath131 kpc is positive for both cases involving large and small diffusivities @xmath37 .",
    "evidently mass can flow across the cooling radius even in the absence of local buoyant transport .",
    "this must arise because of the quasi - adiabatic expansion of the entire cluster gas when cavities are formed . to understand this better , we begin by showing that the volume of gas displaced by cosmic rays @xmath155 depends on the local pressure @xmath156 in the cluster atmosphere and the total energy @xmath87 of the cosmic rays , but not on the ratio of cosmic ray to gas partial pressures , @xmath157 , which changes as the cosmic rays diffuse into the gas .",
    "imagine a uniform gas containing a spherical region of volume @xmath3 that contains a total cosmic ray energy @xmath87 . in pressure equilibrium @xmath158 where @xmath159 and therefore @xmath160 .",
    "but the partial volume @xmath155 containing gas that is actually displaced by the cosmic rays is @xmath161 .",
    "therefore as cosmic rays diffuse into larger volumes @xmath3 , the total volume of gas that is displaced @xmath155 remains unchanged and independent of @xmath37 . in a non - uniform cluster environment",
    "the volume of gas displaced by a given total energy of cosmic rays @xmath87 varies with cluster radius as @xmath162 .",
    "@xmath147 can be estimated by assuming that all cosmic rays in the original cavity do not diffuse beyond their original cavity volume @xmath163 and remain at their initial cluster radius @xmath164 kpc . in this limit , and after several cluster sound crossing times , we expect that the mass flow across @xmath131 kpc will be equal to the gas mass displaced by the original cavity , @xmath165 @xmath20 where @xmath166 , @xmath167 kpc and @xmath168 gm s@xmath17 is the original cluster density at @xmath108 . this simple estimate of the outflowing mass is very similar to that found from figure 6 , @xmath139 @xmath20 .",
    "however , discrepancies between computed and estimated masses @xmath147 are expected because of several additional details .",
    "the cosmic ray energy inside the estimated cavity volume is @xmath169 ergs , where @xmath170 dyne @xmath171 .",
    "however , this energy is about twice as large as the value of @xmath172 in the low-@xmath37 evolution shown in panel @xmath84 of figure 4 , so the estimated value of @xmath147 above should be reduced by a factor of @xmath173 .",
    "however , @xmath147 is expected to differ from @xmath174 because of changes in the mean volume @xmath155 of gas displaced by cosmic rays after their outward motion during time 0.9 gyr . to estimate this suppose that the @xmath31-weighted mean radius of cosmic rays at time 0.9 gyr is @xmath175 kpc ( see figure 2 ) where the gas pressure is @xmath176 dyne @xmath171 . for constant total cosmic ray energy",
    "we expect the volume of gas displaced to vary as @xmath177",
    ". therefore if most of the cosmic rays are transported to @xmath178 kpc , our original estimate of @xmath147 must be increased by @xmath179 .",
    "the combination of both corrections leaves our original estimate nearly unchanged .",
    "considering the uncertainties in these estimates , we conclude that the total mass flow past @xmath131 kpc found from figure 6 for the low-@xmath37 evolution , @xmath139 @xmath20 , is consistent with a quasi - adiabatic expansion of the virgo atmosphere past radius 50 kpc due to gas displaced by cosmic rays when the cavity formed and no buoyant mass flow across @xmath131 kpc is required .",
    "in addition to this atmospheric lifting , buoyant mass flow largely within the cooling radius also contributes to the post - cavity cluster evolution .",
    "buoyant gas increases @xmath118 and as it expands we expect @xmath114 to decrease . but every buoyant element must be accompanied elsewhere in the hot gas atmosphere by a downward replacement flow , largely balancing the buoyant changes in @xmath118 and @xmath114 .",
    "if cavities are created by feedback following a small accretion onto the central agn , a buoyant mass circulation flow is a natural response to the inflow expected from radiative cooling .",
    "the low-@xmath37 cavity evolution ( @xmath111 @xmath35 ) in figure 2 is particularly interesting because all buoyant motion occurs within the cooling radius at 50 kpc .",
    "figure 7 shows contours of the radial velocity @xmath180 at four times during the low-@xmath37 cavity evolution in figure 2 ( @xmath111 @xmath35 ) .",
    "( a plot of the radial velocity in the high-@xmath37 cavity evolution shown in figure 1 is almost identical . )",
    "we plot @xmath180 only near the @xmath43-axis since the radial velocities elsewhere in the atmosphere are very much smaller .",
    "figure 7 shows a strong and sustained subsonic outflow until at least 0.1 gyr . at @xmath181",
    "gyr a backflow occurs near the @xmath43-axis as the densest parts of the thermal `` cavity jet '' fall back toward the cluster center ( see mathews & brighenti 2007b for more details ) . later at @xmath182 gyr a mixture of positive and negative radial velocities is visible but all velocities are smaller and this trend toward quiescence continues until @xmath183 gyr .    because the entropy decreases monotonically with radius in the initial cluster atmosphere",
    ", we can use the entropy as a tracer to confirm that there has been a net mass outflow within 50 kpc during the low-@xmath37 evolution ( which is essentially adiabatic apart from the weak shock wave ) .",
    "we define the gas entropy as @xmath184 in cgs units .",
    "in addition we expect that the buoyancy and outward flow of each gas element will increase with the partial pressure of the cosmic rays , @xmath185 . in the upper panel of figure 8",
    "we plot @xmath185 against @xmath186 , the change between the entropy @xmath187 at 0.9 gyr and the entropy at the same location in the original virgo atmosphere , @xmath188 .",
    "each point corresponds to a computational grid zone . in those regions where @xmath185 is largest",
    "we see that @xmath189 decreases systematically with @xmath185 , indicating that gas containing more cosmic rays at time 0.9 gyr originally came from high entropy regions closer to the cluster center .",
    "the lower panel of figure 8 shows ( with small points ) the location in the cluster at time 0.9 gyr that contains gas with @xmath190 and the open squares mark those ( significantly overlapping ) zones where @xmath191 for the low-@xmath37 cavity evolution .",
    "gas with the highest cosmic ray content is also the gas with the lowest entropy compared to that at the same radius in the original cluster .",
    "the spatial distribution of this low entropy gas is similar to the cosmic ray contours in the final panel of figure 2 .",
    "low entropy regions in the lower panel of figure 8 also have a slightly smaller gas density than adjacent gas at the same cluster radius @xmath134 without cosmic rays . during times of interest for the cluster evolution",
    ", the gas in these post - buoyant regions containing cosmic rays will never return to the cluster core where it initially resided .",
    "figure 8 shows conclusively that low entropy gas originally at small cluster radii has been buoyantly transported outward during the low-@xmath37 post - cavity evolution , but very little has moved beyond 50 kpc by time 0.9 gyr .",
    "cosmic rays from cavities are driving a mass circulation in the cluster gas out to a large fraction of the cooling radius .",
    "evidently the long - term decrease in cluster gas mass @xmath137 @xmath20 within @xmath192 kpc where the cavities formed arises due to the combined effects of the jet of thermal gas along the @xmath43-axis and the cosmic ray buoyancy that prevents much of this gas from returning back to @xmath192 kpc .",
    "recall that @xmath193 is nearly independent of the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient .",
    "the cosmic ray energy required to remove a solar mass of gas from @xmath192 kpc is about @xmath194 erg @xmath195 .",
    "if @xmath196 @xmath20 would cool each year in virgo due to radiation losses alone , the cosmic ray luminosity required for a buoyant outflow to balance @xmath197 is @xmath198 erg yr@xmath17 or @xmath199 erg s@xmath17 .",
    "however , the rate that energy is created by accretion onto the @xmath200 @xmath20 central black hole in m87/virgo is @xmath201 erg s@xmath17 .",
    "the cosmic ray luminosity @xmath202 required to balance a radiating cooling mass inflow in virgo is @xmath203 times less than the accretion luminosity generated by the black hole @xmath204 .",
    "therefore , if only a fraction @xmath205 of the accretion energy converts to cosmic rays that inflate x - ray cavities , this might be sufficient to shut down the cooling flow . a subsequent calculation with multiple cavities and radiative cooling will be required to verify this .",
    "in previous numerical simulations of x - ray cavity evolution ( e.g. brggen & kaiser 2002 ; reynolds et al .",
    "2005 ; gardini 2007 ; pavlovski et al . 2007 ) as well as in the recent review of mcnamara & nulsen ( 2007 ) it has been concluded that the cavities have an important net heating effect on the cluster gas . this result can be understood because the simulated cavities were inflated with ultra - hot ( but non - relativistic ) gas . as these cavities are initially inflated , they perform an amount of heating @xmath206 on the surrounding cluster gas , but the thermal energy inside the cavities also contributes to the cluster thermal energy budget . when we perform calculations in which cavities are inflated with ultra - hot gas , we also find a ( small ) net heating when the total cluster thermal energy includes the energy injected inside the cavity .",
    "in this case the total energy introduced by the cavity is @xmath207pv = ( 2.5 - 4)pv$ ] , depending on the assumed value of @xmath77 inside the cavity .",
    "( after times @xmath208 yr most of the energy of hot - gas cavities is stored in the potential energy of the cluster . )",
    "the approximate values of @xmath98 plotted in figure 4 show the estimated cavity heating when cavities are formed with ultra - hot gas ( e.g. birzan et al . 2004 ; rafferty et al .",
    "2007 ; mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) .    but ultra - hot gas is not an appropriate substitute for cosmic rays . when the diffusion @xmath37 is sufficiently small and cosmic rays are strongly trapped within the cavities , we find here that the expanding cavities also heat the gas by @xmath206 . this can be seen in figure 4 where @xmath209 .",
    "but the cosmic ray contents of our cavities never contribute to the cluster thermal energy .",
    "instead , the displacement of cluster gas by the diffusing , buoyant cosmic rays results in an overall expansion and cooling of the cluster gas .",
    "it should also be recognized that the introduction of ultra - hot gas in previous numerical simulations of cavity evolution implicitly suggests that mass as well as cosmic ray energy is transported out from the central agn , i.e. this conventional means of cavity formation must be regarded as a ( mass ) circulation flow similar to those we have considered ( mathews et al . 2003 ; 2004 ) .",
    "this assumed non - relativistic mass outflow can be quite large as we discussed in the introduction . while we assume here that the agn produces jets of pure relativistic energy , it is possible that real jets do in fact carry non - relativistic mass away from the central agn ( as in brighenti & mathews 2006 ) .",
    "nevertheless , current x - ray observations have been unable to detect thermal emission from ultra - hot gas in the cavities ( e.g. mcnamara & nulsen 2007 , but see mazzotta et al .",
    "it is generally agreed that the dominant source of feedback energy in galaxy clusters is accretion onto central black holes ( agns ) .",
    "some of this accretion energy is thought to be transported out into the cluster gas by jets , forming x - ray cavities . in previous numerical simulations of x - ray cavity evolution",
    "the cavities were formed by introducing ultra - hot , non - relativistic gas at some radius in the cluster gas .",
    "for the first time we consider cavities that are formed exclusively by cosmic rays that can both diffuse through the cluster gas and be advected by it .",
    "we discuss the energetics of x - ray cavity and radio lobe evolution in the hot gas within the virgo galaxy cluster . for simplicity",
    "we consider cavities that are formed in time @xmath86 yrs by cosmic rays with total energy @xmath97 ergs but which have a wide range of cosmic ray diffusion coefficients @xmath37 since this is currently the most uncertain parameter in cavity - lobe evolution . for simplicity , we do not consider here secular energy losses in the cosmic rays due to synchrotron emission , coulomb heating , inverse compton losses , spallation etc .",
    ", so the total cosmic ray energy can only change due to local expansion or compression by the thermal gas . in this approximation cosmic ray pressure gradients",
    "interact with the cluster gas in a perfectly adiabatic fashion .",
    ".1in(1 ) as cavities expand during formation , they generate weak shock waves that propagate into the surrounding cluster gas where the shock energy is dissipated .",
    "when the cosmic ray diffusion @xmath37 is low , the maximum shock heating @xmath210 is approached .",
    "as @xmath37 increases the cosmic ray pressure gradients are lower and the shock heating is considerably less . in general , @xmath98 , which varies with time , is an inaccurate measure of @xmath115",
    ". these results are consistent with our earlier studies of 1d cavity evolution in a uniform gas ( mathews & brighenti 2007a ) .",
    ".1in(2 ) the longevity of visible x - ray cavities and the radial distance that they move out in the cluster gas during their lifetimes both increase as the cosmic ray diffusion @xmath37 decreases . unlike cavities formed with hot gas ( e.g. gardini 2007 ) ,",
    "cosmic ray cavities remain coherent for @xmath211 yrs .    .1in(3 ) in spite of shock heating , cavities formed by cosmic rays have a net cooling effect on the cluster gas .",
    "this is unlike the cluster heating when cavities are inflated largely with ultra - hot but non - relativistic gas , as commonly assumed , that later contributes to the cluster thermal energy .",
    ".1in(4 ) the qualitative character of post - cavity energetics remains similar when the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient @xmath37 varies over a wide range .",
    "after several @xmath22 yrs the total energy change in the cluster @xmath121 increases as @xmath37 decreases .",
    ".1in(5 ) as cosmic rays displace cluster gas , the entire cluster atmosphere expands and cools , increasing the cluster potential energy and decreasing its thermal energy .",
    "successive cavities will result in an irreversible expansion of the cluster gas as long as most of the cosmic rays remain trapped within or near the cooling radius , as in our computed post - cavity evolutions .",
    ".1in(6 ) inhomogeneously distributed cosmic rays are an important source of buoyancy and mass flow in the cluster gas . as the cluster gas surrounding cavities",
    "is penetrated by diffusing cosmic rays , this gas rises in the cluster potential , driving a net mass outflow in the cluster gas .",
    "radial mass circulation occurs even when no gas flows out in the agn jets .",
    ".1in(7 ) after buoyant gas containing cosmic rays flows from the cluster core into distant , low - density regions , it remains there never to return during times comparable to the cluster age . because of the necessarily positive entropy gradient in the pre - cavity cluster , the entropy in the post - buoyant gas in these distant regions is slightly lower than elsewhere at the same cluster radius .",
    ".1in(8 ) to quantify the previous conclusion , suppose a mass @xmath212 within the cluster radius @xmath134 where the x - ray cavity forms is irrevocably transported by cosmic ray buoyancy to distant regions in the cluster gas .",
    "we find that a cosmic ray energy of @xmath213 ergs removes a solar mass of gas from the cavity site .",
    "for example in the virgo cluster a cosmic ray luminosity of only @xmath214 erg s@xmath17 can remove gas at the cooling flow rate @xmath215 @xmath20 yr@xmath17 that would otherwise occur in the absence of feedback energy .",
    "only a fraction @xmath205 of the accretion energy onto the central black hole in m87/virgo , @xmath216 , if converted to cosmic rays that inflate x - ray cavities , is in principle sufficient to shut down the cooling flow .",
    "our conclusions suggest that cosmic ray buoyancy provides an important new means of understanding or possibly solving the cooling flow problem with an outward mass circulation that may balance the inexorable inflow due to radiation losses .",
    "this outward mass flow due to cosmic ray buoyancy has the added attraction of not heating the gas too much  in fact cavity formation with cosmic rays produces a net cooling .",
    "it remains to be determined if the radio emission or @xmath217 gamma emission from galaxy clusters are at levels that are consistent with the buoyant activity required to arrest the cooling flow rate .",
    "after a few @xmath22 years most of the cosmic rays will be in very low density gas where such emission will be greatly reduced ."
