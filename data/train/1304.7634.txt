    "the existence of glueballs is a consequence of the self - interaction of gluons in qcd with consequences studied already about 40 years ago @xcite . today , within the lattice qcd approach",
    ", the mass of the lightest scalar glueball is found around 1700 mev in the theory with gluons only while in the full theory the mass is found to drop to @xmath1 mev @xcite or to stay largely unchanged @xcite .",
    "qcd sum rules predict scalar gluonic mesons as well in the range 1000 - 1700 mev @xcite .",
    "the experimental search for a scalar glueball has lead to several scenarios for a spectroscopy with glueballs .",
    "a recent status of theoretical and experimental results on glueballs is found in @xcite .",
    "one strategy to find glueballs is based on the identification of the scalar nonets lowest in mass and the search for super - numerous isoscalar states which could be related to the presence of a glueball in the spectrum .",
    "in addition , pure glueballs are characterised by flavour symmetric decays ( with possible modifications @xcite ) and they are expected to be predominantly produced in `` gluon - rich '' processes . in general , glueballs could mix with isoscalar quarkonium states .",
    "an important example for such a supernumerous state is @xmath0 which we will discuss here in particular .",
    "the states above 1 gev listed by the particle data group @xcite @xmath2 can be interpreted as being formed by a nonet of @xmath3 states and a glueball where the two @xmath3 isoscalars and the glueball mix into three isoscalar @xmath4 s .",
    "such a scheme has been suggested originally by amsler and close @xcite . at that time",
    "the newly discovered @xmath5 meson has been related to the glueball with mass predicted near 1500 mev by lattice theory with gluons only .",
    "the closer inspection of the decay branching ratios , however , suggested a mixing scheme for the three @xmath4 mesons .",
    "other mixing schemes for the glueball are considered in @xcite , for a review , see @xcite .",
    "the states below 1 gev @xmath6 can be grouped into a light meson nonet is not considered as established by the pdg at present . ]",
    "formed by @xmath3 ( as in @xcite ) or by diquark bound states ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "the crucial element in these schemes with glueball is the existence of @xmath0 and therefore we will reconsider the evidence . in the actual edition of the pdg the rather wide ranges for mass and width are reported @xmath7 there are 12 decay channels `` seen '' : @xmath8 and various sub - channels of @xmath9 , but no single experimental number on branching ratios nor ratios thereof has been determined because of conflicting results .",
    "this is quite different from the nearby @xmath5 with five well established branching ratios .",
    "accordingly , supportive @xcite and sceptical views @xcite about @xmath0 have been presented in the past . a detailed discussion of various observations is given in @xcite .",
    "here we present an overview and some details of two energy independent analyses .",
    "the evidence for @xmath0 has been presented first in @xmath10 annihilation at rest by the crystal barrel collaboration ( cbar ) @xcite and this state has been studied together with @xmath5 in the reactions @xmath11 signal bands in the dalitz plots related to @xmath5 are always clearly visible . a signal from @xmath0 can be seen in the @xmath12 channel but there is an interference with the @xmath13 resonances in crossed channels .",
    "the @xmath0 signal disappears immediatly if the cms energy is increased above the @xmath10 threshold .",
    "so the evidence for @xmath0 relies on the proper global multi - channel fit with various interfering resonances present .",
    "these problems are avoided if the @xmath14 wave amplitudes are reconstructed in an energy independent analysis in a sequence of mass bins with sufficiently high statistics .",
    "the resonant behaviour is then found from the characteristic behaviour of the complex amplitude .",
    "such results are available for 2-body @xmath15 scattering , which can be reconstructed from @xmath16 processes .",
    "proper care has to be taken in these analyses in the treatment of nucleon spins .",
    "other high statistics results became available recently from @xmath17 where the spin problems disappear or from @xmath18 with only one spinning particle .",
    "in central production processes @xmath19 the measurements at sps energies are difficult to analyse because of non - trivial superpositions from processes with different nucleon helicities @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of @xmath0 decays goes into @xmath9 channels ( @xmath20 . here different experiments on central production and @xmath10 annihilation provide conflicting results ; furthermore no evidence for the existence of two resonances at 1370 and 1500 mev has been found @xcite . here",
    "some clarification is necessary . in this note",
    "we restrict ourselves to some 2-body processes where energy independent phase shifts are available .",
    "such data are extracted from the reaction @xmath22 in application of the one - pion - exchange model .",
    "energy independent phase shift analyses of @xmath23 scattering up to 1800 mev have been carried out first by the cern - munich group @xcite ( cm - i ) using the assumptions of `` spin and phase coherence '' @xcite ; results above 1400 mev are superseded by the more complete analyses based on cm - ii data ( see below ) . above 1 gev",
    "there are in general multiple phase shift solutions which represent the same @xmath21 angular distribution moments .",
    "such multiple solutions up to 1800 mev have been obtained first by estabrooks and martin @xcite .",
    "based on an improved data analysis the cern - munich group obtained a similar set of results with some smaller errors @xcite ( cm - ii ) .",
    "a unique solution has been found by combining with results from gams collaboration @xcite on the @xmath24 final state @xcite .    the isoscalar @xmath14 wave is shown in fig .",

    ", global multi - resonance fits to the angular moment data ( cm - i ) with @xmath0 included have been presented in @xcite showing an additional resonance circle .",

    "@xmath3 nonet including @xmath32 and @xmath5 with a flavour mixing as for @xmath41 but with reversed mass ordering had been proposed before @xcite .",
    "no @xmath42 is needed in this scheme ; note that the phase movement in @xmath43 scattering related to @xmath42 is only about @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "recently an attempt has been presented to determine the constituent structure of the light @xmath45 from available branching fractions @xcite .",
    "it is found that the @xmath37 decays are not `` flavour blind '' as expected for a glueball .",
    "the flavour composition of @xmath32 is found similar to the one of @xmath46 confirming the earlier result @xcite ; the gluonic component is estimated as @xmath47 . for @xmath5 a gluonic component is established as function of the scalar mixing angle @xmath48 .",
    "then , a minimal mixing scheme is proposed as @xmath49 is near a flavour octet with the mixing angle @xmath50 , and @xmath51 in the simplest model . for @xmath52 we recover the model @xcite .",
    "the strong mixing of the glueball into @xmath40 and @xmath5 is a feature also found in recent qcd lattice calculations @xcite and qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "after 40 years of experimental and theoretical work our knowledge on the scalar mesons has been considerably improved , but we have not yet succeded ultimately to proof the existence of the scalar glueball and to determine its mass .",
    "the identification of a supernumerous state in the nonet classification of mesons depends on the knowledge of all nonet members .",
    "this is difficult if broad objects like @xmath0 are involved with small 2-body branching ratios if any .",
    "therefore we have argued @xcite not to rely only on establishing such difficult states like @xmath0 but to investigate other approaches as well .",
    "study of leading resonances in gluon jets ( at large feynman @xmath53 ) .",
    "+ several lep experiments observed a significant excess of neutral leading clusters beyond expectations from mc s as one expects from glueball production .",
    "the effect should be stronger at the lhc .",
    "study of decays of charmonium states like @xmath54 with primary @xmath55 decay .",
    "+ pairs of scalar particles should be produced according to flavour symmetry if they belong to the same @xmath3 multiplet , but deviations are expected for gluonic states .",
    "such studies hopefully will provide new evidence for gluonic mesons if they exist .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers for providing the stimulating athmosphere with useful discussions and to peter minkowski for the collaboration .",
