    "calculation of error probability for linear programming ( lp ) decoding of binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) modulated binary codes is often a complex task .",
    "this is mainly due to the complexity of lp voronoi or decision regions @xcite @xcite .",
    "the probability of correct decision in an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , can be obtained by integrating a multidimensional gaussian distribution over the decision region of the transmitted codeword ( cw ) .",
    "lp decoding is a relaxed version of the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding .",
    "the _ codeword polytope _",
    "@xcite of ml is replaced by a relaxed polytope , called the _ fundamental polytope _ @xcite .",
    "the fundamental polytope arisen from a given parity check matrix .",
    "its vertices are every codeword , but it also has some non - codeword .",
    "the vertices of the codeword polytope are the all codewords , and the vertices of the fundamental polytope are called _ pseudocodewords _ ( pcws ) @xcite . the additional non - codewords make the decision region @xcite of the lp decoder even more complex than that of the ml .",
    "therefore , a derivation of analytical bounds has an important role in evaluating the performance of the lp decoder .",
    "the _ fundamental cone _",
    "@xcite is the conic hull of the fundamental polytope .",
    "the lp error probability over the fundamental polytope is equal to that over the fundamental cone @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is sufficient to consider _ _ only the fundamental cone _ generators _",
    "@xcite for evaluating the performance of the lp decoder .",
    "the well - known upper bound on the error probability of a digital communication system is the _ union bound _ ( ub ) , which is a first - order _ bonferroni - type _",
    "inequality @xcite in the probability theory .",
    "the ub of the lp decoder @xcite @xcite @xcite for high - density parity - check ( hdpc ) codes presets inaccurate results due to the high density of fundamental cone generators .",
    "in fact , the union bound sums all of the pairwise error events as if they were disjoint , but this scenario is far from being the case in lp decoding of hdpc codes .",
    "each pseudocodeword in the lp decoder can be located in the bpsk signal space @xcite .",
    "what the lp decoder does , it chooses the nearest pseudocodeword to the received vector as the most likely transmitted pseudocodeword .",
    "the ml soft decision decoder has such property as well , but unlike to the lp decoder , its signal space contains only the set of the all codewords .",
    "thus many of ml upper bounds can be reused @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite in the case of lp decoding .    for a given code ,",
    "each of its parity - check matrix creates a fundamental cone with different pseudo - weight spectrum and geometrical structure , which influences differently on the error probability of the lp decoder .",
    "therefore , the geometrical properties of the fundamental cone generators are essential to evaluate with a better accuracy the lp decoding error probability . thus ml error probability bounds which use the weight spectrum of the code or those who sum the error contribution of each individual codeword become less attractive . in @xcite a ml bound",
    "is presented which is based on the second - order upper bound on the probability of a finite union of events . and",
    "indeed , it uses the geometrical properties of the codewords and considers an intersection of pairwise error events , but involves relatively high computational complexity .    to explore the density of the fundamental cone generators , we have defined the _ angle graph _ : each generator is considered as a node of a complete undirected graph .",
    "the cost of an edge is the angle between the generators related to the adjacent nodes .",
    "the minimum spanning tree is found and its cost distribution is illustrated .",
    "different patterns for various parity - check matrices were observed .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an upper bound based on the second - order of bonferroni - type inequality .",
    "the bound needs the fundamental cone generators rather than their weight spectrum .",
    "we call it improved linear programming union bound ( ilp - ub ) .",
    "it consists of two parts : the first term is the lp union bound itself , and the second term is a second - order correction that can be optimized by a known minimum spanning tree algorithm .",
    "it requires relatively low computational complexity since it involves only the @xmath0-function .",
    "the proposed ilp - ub makes use of an upper bound of the triplet - wise error probability that has been introduced earlier in the paper .",
    "we derive analytical expression to evaluate the triple - wise error probability depending on the angle which they create . and for example , the triple - wise error probability for the minimal - weight generators of the bch[63,57,3 ] code is calculated .",
    "it is compared to the triple - wise error upper bound and to the ub in different angles and signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) .",
    "the proposed ilp - ub was tested on three hdpc codes : golay[24,12,8 ] , bch[31,26,3 ] , bch[63 , 57,3 ] , and on the low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) tanner code [ 155,64,20 ] @xcite .",
    "an improvement of up to 0.37 db has been demonstrated over the conventional linear programming union bound ( lp - ub ) .",
