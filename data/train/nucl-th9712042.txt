    "although the constituent quark models have been successful in reproducing various static properties of baryons @xcite , there still remains several problems .",
    "one of them is the mass spectrum of the spin @xmath0 nucleon resonances .",
    "the conventional models can not explain the fact that the ground state is remarkably light while the separations among the excited states are relatively narrow @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mass of @xmath3 is predicted to be too high .",
    "glozman _ et al .",
    "_ have recently examined baryon mass spectra by using the constituent quark model with the one - meson - exchange potential ( omep ) as the residual interaction between quarks @xcite , whereas the conventional models contain the one - gluon - exchange potential ( ogep ) instead @xcite .",
    "the omep has been introduced on the basis of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath4s ) in low - energy qcd . in direct consequence of sb@xmath4s",
    ", there appear nambu - goldstone bosons ( i.e. , the flavor - octet pseudoscalar mesons such as @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ) as well as the mass of light quarks @xcite .",
    "in addition to the flavor - octet mesons , the flavor - singlet @xmath8 has been also taken into account for the nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "et al . _ have claimed that the model provides a unified description of the ground states and the excitation spectra of baryon resonances .",
    "they have also pointed out that the spin - flavor dependence of the omep is important to reproduce the mass spectra .    on the other hand",
    ", there exists another type of mesonic effects .",
    "the self - energy of baryons , which comes from the coupling between single baryon states and meson - baryon scattering states , have been studied by one of the authors ( m.a . ) and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "they have shown , for example , that the large @xmath9 decay width of @xmath10 as well as the mass splitting between @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be explained by the effect of the self - energy .",
    "we note here that they have used the ogep for the residual quark - quark interaction .    in this paper",
    ", we construct the model consisting of the constituent quarks and the pseudoscalar mesons with the pseudovector meson - quark coupling .",
    "the quarks and mesons are treated as the elementary degrees of freedom on the basis of sb@xmath4s .",
    "since the meson - quark coupling gives rise not only to the omep but also to the self - energy , the two mesonic effects can be treated on an equal footing .",
    "the omep mainly stems from the exchange of the off - energy - shell mesons whose energies are nearly equal to zero , while the self - energy does from the on - energy - shell mesons .",
    "the two contributions , however , can not be strictly separated as is clearly seen in the relativistic formalism where they correspond to the same diagram @xcite .",
    "therefore , the problem of double counting should be resolved in order to treat them in a consistent manner .",
    "the purpose of this work is not to obtain a perfect fit to the observed baryon masses but to investigate the consistent model containing the two mesonic effects .",
    "we calculate the mass spectra of nucleon resonances and mainly examine the dynamical effect on the mass spectrum of the self - energy , which is absent in the conventional calculations .",
    "the self - energy provides the energy - dependent effect on resonance masses , while the omep does the static effect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the constituent quark model with the meson - quark coupling",
    "is presented , and the omep and the self - energy are derived with an emphasis on the problem of double counting .",
    "the method of calculation is explained also .",
    "the numerical results for nucleon resonances are shown in section 3 .",
    "the summary of the paper is given in section 4 .",
    "the model hamiltonian for the meson - quark system @xmath13 consists of the internal hamiltonian of the baryon @xmath14 , the kinetic energy of the baryon @xmath15 ( i.e. , the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) motion of the three quarks ) , the total energy of the meson @xmath16 , and the meson - quark coupling @xmath17 , as follows : @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the kinetic energy of the quarks without the c.m .",
    "motion , @xmath21 the confinement potential for the quarks , and @xmath22 the constant mass parameter of the baryon .",
    "note that @xmath15 and @xmath16 have non - vanishing contributions only for meson - baryon scattering channels .",
    "the non - relativistic kinematics is used for the constituent quarks : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the quark mass and @xmath25 the momentum of the @xmath26th quark . here the mass difference between u- and d - quarks is neglected and the conventional value of the quark mass is used : @xmath27 .",
    "the above decomposition can be easily done by means of jacobi coordinates in the non - relativistic kinematics .",
    "this property is quite favorable in the investigation of baryon mass spectra and meson - baryon scattering .    for the confinement potential that ensures the three quarks are always confined in the baryon ,",
    "the linear form is employed : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the strength parameter and @xmath30 the coordinate of the @xmath26th quark .",
    "this type of confinement is suggested by the lattice qcd calculations for heavy quark systems @xcite as well as by the flux tube model @xcite . since",

    "the spin - flavor dependence of the self - energy is the same as that of the omep since it essentially comes from the vertex function @xmath81 , i.e. , the matrix element of the meson - quark coupling .",

    ", we present the method of calculating the baryon mass spectrum .",
    "the matrix elements of the mass operator @xmath51 are systematically calculated with the basis functions , i.e. , the three - quark bound - state wave functions , which are the antisymmetrized products of the quark wave functions that consist of the space , spin , flavor and color parts .",

    "this variational method provides the value of @xmath89 .",
    "it also has been found that the basis functions upto the @xmath90-shell of the harmonic - oscillator wave functions are enough to obtain the results with good accuracy and stability .",
    "the energy - dependence and the imaginary part of the mass operator @xmath51 prevent us from naively interpreting its eigenvalues as resonance masses .",
    "the resonances correspond to the s - channel poles of the propagator for meson - baryon scattering : @xmath91 therefore the resonance mass @xmath92 can be approximately determined as the solution of @xmath93 after the energy - dependent eigenvalues are obtained by the diagonalization of the mass operator @xmath51 .",
    "the present model still has six parameters to be determined : the strength of the confinement potential @xmath29 , the form factor parameter @xmath94 , the bare mass of baryons @xmath22 , and the @xmath5- , @xmath7- , and @xmath48-quark coupling constants , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath95 , respectively . the parameters except @xmath49 are phenomenologically determined to reproduce the prominent feature of the mass spectrum of the spin @xmath0 nucleon resonances : the separations among the negative- and positive - parity resonances are relatively small in comparison with the large mass difference between the ground state nucleon and the other resonances .",
    "all the parameters thus determined are summarized in table [ tbl : parameter ] .",

    "are not used because of the badly broken flavor su(3 ) relation for these mesons . for @xmath50 ,",
    "for example , the fitting process provides the small value of 3.52 , which is different from the value of 4.59 derived from the @xmath7-nucleon coupling constant .",
    "the excitation energies put the constraint on the determination of the confinement strength @xmath29 . because eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mass ] ) is a non - linear equation of energy variable , the role of @xmath22 is more than just an additional constant .",
    "the phenomenological parameter @xmath94 , which may be related with the finite size of the meson and the constituent quark , is quite difficult to be determined from other sources of information . in the fitting procedure ,",
    "this parameter has correlation with the meson - quark coupling strengths through the momentum dependence of the form factor .",
    "let us present the mass spectra of the current model .",
    "the masses of the spin @xmath0 nucleon resonances are shown in fig .",
    "the calculation can reproduce the general feature of the observed spectrum fairly well .",
    "the excitation energies of the first negative - parity states are calculated to be about @xmath98 , and the mass differences among the excited nucleons becomes relatively small compared with the excitation energies .    in order to make clear the reason why the model can reproduce these features ,",
    "each contribution of the mesonic effects on the mass spectrum is examined . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the result without the self - energy @xmath99 and subtraction term @xmath74 is also shown , the self - energy , as well as the omep , significantly contributes to the mass spectrum . in the consistent treatment of the meson - quark coupling in this work ,",
    "the self - energy has almost the same magnitude as the omep .",
    "for example , the diagonal element of the omep for the ground - state nucleon is @xmath100 , and the corresponding self - energy @xmath101 is about @xmath102 .",
    "the subtraction term @xmath74 is @xmath103 , and is comparable with the self - energy and the omep .",
    "therefore the naive sum of the self - energy and the omep without this subtraction causes serious overestimate of the mesonic effects .",
    "it should be also emphasized that the subtraction term depends on the initial and final baryon states and is not merely a constant parameter .    for the positive - parity states , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the self - energy due to the @xmath9 state is generally smaller than that due to the @xmath46 state .",
    "this is because of the restriction of the phase space since the @xmath9 threshold is higher than the @xmath46 threshold .",
    "the self - energy for the ground - state nucleon",
    "n is remarkably large because @xmath104 strongly couples to the intermediate @xmath46 state without changing the configuration of quarks in a baryon .",
    "the nucleon mass is pulled down partly owing to this effect .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the cusp behavior is seen at the @xmath9 threshold for the negative - parity states due to their @xmath105-wave coupling to the @xmath9 state .",
    "it is a characteristic feature of the self - energy , and this energy dependence is important to the dynamical properties of resonances .",
    "the omep does not have such energy - dependence .",
    "for the states in the same ` @xmath106'-shell , the non - diagonal elements of the self - energy have the same magnitude as the diagonal elements .",
    "note , however , that the state mixing among the different shells is relatively small since the off - diagonal elements of the total mass operator @xmath51 are in general smaller than the differences in its diagonal elements .    in the present calculation",
    ", the mass of the ground - state nucleon @xmath104 is @xmath107 , which is larger than the observed one by about @xmath108 .",
    "the disagreement is partly ascribed to the approximate treatment of @xmath104 in the intermediate @xmath46 and @xmath9 states . in these decay channels , @xmath104 is considered just a three - quark bound state since multi - meson states are neglected in this work .",
    "the physical nucleon is , however , the admixture of the three - quark state , meson and three - quark state , and so on .",
    "the probability of observing the three - quark component is related with the energy - derivative of @xmath73 as @xmath109 due to the strong energy - dependence of @xmath73 around @xmath92 , the probability @xmath110 deviates from 1 : we obtain @xmath111 for @xmath104 . because the relatively large part of the wave function is occupied by the meson - nucleon component , further study of the mesonic effects",
    "is required if we try to describe the property of the nucleon in detail .",
    "we examine the role of the spin - flavor symmetry of the omep by comparing it with the `` color - spin symmetry '' of the ogep .",
    "to show the difference between the omep and the ogep in an explicit way , we consider the @xmath112 and @xmath113 excited - states , which are @xmath114 and @xmath115 excited - states , respectively .",

    "the symmetry property of the omep is characterized by @xmath121 , where @xmath122 stands for the spatial part of the interaction , and @xmath26 and @xmath66 denote the @xmath123th and @xmath124th quarks , respectively . similarly , the ogep has the operator @xmath125 .",
    "we obtain the diagonal matrix elements of these operators as shown in table [ tbl : matrix - element ] .",
    "since these potentials are of short - range and attractive , the following relations hold : @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in the case of the omep , the difference is @xmath128 .",
    "since the two terms are added constructively , the mass of the @xmath112 state is lowered more largely than that of the @xmath113 state due to the omep , that is , the former gets close to the latter . in the case of the ogep , on the other hand , the difference is @xmath129 , the magnitude of which becomes small owing to the destructive combination .",
    "the similar argument can be applied to the other @xmath113 state with [ 21]@xmath116 @xmath117 [ 3]@xmath118 @xmath117 [ 21]@xmath119 @xmath117 [ 111]@xmath120 symmetry .",
    "the property of the spin - flavor symmetry in the omep is thus consistent with the fact the observed mass of @xmath3 is remarkably light .",
    "the spin - flavor symmetry of the self - energy also plays an important role in making the @xmath112 resonances come close to the @xmath113 resonances , as is shown in fig .",

    "if the relativistic correction in the kinetic energy operator is so important , the vertex functions should be also modified in a consistent manner .",

    "we proceed to show the spectra of the spin @xmath1 and @xmath2 nucleon resonances in fig .",
    "all the parameters for these resonances are the same as those for the spin @xmath0 resonances .",

    "the effect of @xmath45 is favorable since it reduces the contribution from the virtual high - energy intermediate states that the present model may not be applied to .",
    "but for @xmath45 , the spin - dependence of @xmath22 should be inevitable .",
    "we have constructed the constituent quark model which contains the meson - quark coupling to incorporate the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in low - energy qcd , and calculated the masses of nucleon resonances .",

    ", the consistent treatment of the meson - quark coupling provides the omep and the self - energy of baryons with the subtraction term , which is important to avoid the problem of double counting .",
    "since both of the mesonic effects are significantly large , we should take account of these terms simultaneously if we try to include the mesonic effects in the model of baryons .",

    "relativistic corrections are to be investigated in near future also .    furthermore , we have to calculate the scattering quantities and compare them directly with the experimental data in order to complete the investigation of the model .",
    "this type of study is necessary since the masses of nucleon resonances represent only a small part of the information of the phase shift analysis of the @xmath46 scattering .",
