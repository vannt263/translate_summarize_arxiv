    "a rich population of very high energy ( vhe ; @xmath3gev ) @xmath4-ray emitters has been discovered during a systematic scan of the galactic plane with the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ; * ? ? ?",

    "sources in the galactic plane that appear point - like are associated with the galactic high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , or young pwne ( e.g. , the crab nebula ) . outside of the galactic plane ,",
    "the unresolved @xmath4-ray sources have been predominantly identified with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "so far , more than 50 agn , mostly blazars of the bl lacertae type ( hereafter bl lacs ) , have been detected in the vhe range .",
    "the unresolved , steady , and soft - spectrum ( photon index @xmath6 ) tev source hess  j1943 + 213  was initially discovered in the galactic plane scan data collected between 2005 and 2008 , at the significance level of @xmath7 corresponding to a @xmath8tev photon flux of @xmath9ph@xmath10s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it is located within the @xmath12 error circle of an unidentified hard x - ray _ integral _  source igr  j19443 + 2117 , which was also seen with _ rosat _ , _ chandra _ , and _ swift _  @xcite . based on the gathered multiwavelength data",
    ", @xcite argued in favor of the extragalactic ( and in particular blazar ) nature of the source ( but see * ? ? ? * and the discussion below ) .",
    "blazars are agn with relativistic jets pointed close to the earth s line of sight .",
    "the typical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a blazar is dominated by the non - thermal doppler - boosted jet emission , and is characterized by two distinct components , or humps in the @xmath13 representation : the low - energy one , commonly interpreted as due to synchrotron emission of ultra - relativistic jet electrons , peaking in the infrared  to  x - ray range , and the high - energy one peaking in the @xmath4-ray regime , most widely believed to be due to inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of low - energy photons by the synchrotron - emitting electrons .",
    "the peak energy of both spectral components was found to anti - correlate with the total radiative power , and also with the ` compton dominance ' , i.e. the ratio of the ic and synchrotron luminosities @xcite , although the origins of these correlations are controversial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "high - frequency peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) occupy the lowest luminosity / highest frequency end of the blazar luminosity sequence , with the two spectral components peaking in x - rays ( typically @xmath14kev ) and in the vhe range ( @xmath14tev ) , respectively .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the broad - band spectral properties of hess j1943 + 213 are consistent with the source being an example of the so - called ` extreme hbl ' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only viewed through the galactic disk and located at a minimum distance of @xmath2mpc @xcite .",
    "this distance limit would then set the x - ray luminosity of the source as @xmath15ergs@xmath11 , which is relatively high for an hbl .",
    "yet what is the most remarkable for this blazar candidate is its hard x - ray spectrum with no apparent cut - off up to 195kev photon energies , as indicated by a long accumulation of the _",
    "swift_-bat data ( see * ? ? ?",

    ", hess  j1943 + 213  would in fact outshine the most extreme confirmed hbls known to date , such as 1es  0347@xmath0121  @xcite 1es  0229 + 200  @xcite .",
    "we note that blazars are characterized by substantial broad - band variability at all accessible timescales , but the apparent lack of any flux changes in the case of hess  j1943 + 213 , even though puzzling , does not strictly exclude the blazar hypothesis .    the class of extreme hbls , which seems peculiar for its physical properties ( particularly low magnetization but high bulk velocities of the emitting regions ; see * ? ? ?",

    "no significant variability or modulation was seen over the entire 80ks _ suzaku _  pointing ( 40ks net exposure ) .",
    "since the hard x - ray signal detected with hxd / pin was not very strong , the resulting light curve of the source above 10kev was partly affected by statistical and systematic fluctuations , and as such is rather inconclusive .",

    "the spectrum is well represented by a single power - law model ( reduced @xmath81/d.o.f @xmath82 1.11/847 ) with photon index @xmath83 , absorbed by the hydrogen column density of @xmath84@xmath10 , in agreement with the one emerging from the previous _ swift _",
    "observations , but in excess over the galactic value of @xmath85 @xmath10 estimated based on the galactic leiden / argentine / bonn ( lab ) survey @xcite .",
    "we also applied an unabsorbed broken power - law model to the _ suzaku _  spectrum of hess  j1943 + 213 and rejected it because of a much larger reduced chi - square value of 1.21 with respect to the single absorbed power - law model .",
    "the unabsorbed @xmath86kev flux of the source reads as @xmath87erg@xmath10s@xmath11 , again in remarkable agreement with the previous _",
    "swift_-xrt observations @xcite , indicating that hess  j1943 + 213  is a truly steady x - ray emitter .",
    "in order to investigate in more detail the issue of the excess absorption in the x - ray spectrum of hess  j1943 + 213 , we have modeled the acquired _ suzaku _  data with the ` synchrotron ` code developed and implemented in xspec by @xcite .",
    "in this `` parametric forward - fitting '' model , the observed x - ray emission of a source is fitted with the synchrotron continuum originating from a given ( assumed ) shape of the electron energy distribution , instead of the assumed spectral form of the non - thermal emission continuum .",
    "therefore , the xspec fitting with the ` synchrotron ` model allows us to check in particular if the suppressed soft x - ray flux of hess  j1943 + 213  is due to the excess absorption indeed , or is rather due to the high low - energy cut - off in the underlying electron energy distribution ( see in this context the case of 1es  0229 + 200 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to reduce the number of model free parameters , in the fitting procedure we assumed a single power - law electron energy distribution @xmath88 with fixed energy index @xmath89 and the maximum electron lorentz factor @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 is the doppler factor of the emission region , and @xmath92 is the comoving magnetic field intensity ) ; only the minimum electron lorentz factor @xmath93 and the absorbing column density @xmath94 were allowed to vary .",
    "the modeling returned @xmath95 , and @xmath96@xmath10 still in excess of the galactic value , even though the observed flux decrease below 1kev was in this case ascribed partly to the high low - energy electron cut - off .",
    "we note that the analogous modeling with @xmath94 fixed at the galactic value resulted in a large reduced chi - square , while on the other hand the modeling with frozen @xmath97 returned @xmath98 and @xmath99@xmath10 in agreement with the emission continuum power - law fit discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "hence , we conclude that the signatures for the excess absorption in the x - ray spectrum of hess  j1943 + 213 , even though on a rather modest level , can nonetheless be claimed robustly .",
    "we note that previously some evidence for the intrinsic absorption of the x - ray spectra of hbls has been presented only in a few cases , namely mrk501 @xcite , and more recently 1rxs j101015.9311909 @xcite .",

    "* ) , is in general steeper than that of hess  j1943 + 213 .",
    "also , the ir segments of the spectra are distinct , although this difference seems to be consistent with the idea of a more prominent contribution from the elliptical host in hess  j1943 + 213  due to the smaller distance of the source ( @xmath2mpc versus @xmath116mpc for 1es  0347@xmath0121 ; see the discussion below ) .",

    "the lack of any orbital modulation in the x - ray band might be baffling in this context , but still does not exclude the possibility of the discussed object being a binary system .",
    "similarly , no ( or a very weak ) gev counterpart does not contradict the idea ( keeping in mind the case of hess j0632 + 057 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "the most problematic aspect of the scenario is , however , the absence of a massive companion manifesting as a pronounce ir / optical source .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the 2mass @xmath45-band counterpart of hess  j1943 + 213  could in principle be attributed to the massive o or be - type star taking into account the 2mass and _ swift_-uvot upper limits derived at shorter wavelengths , but only in the case of a large distance to the system , @xmath119kpc .",
    "this would in turn imply exceptionally high ( for an hmxb ) x - ray luminosity , exceeding @xmath120ergs@xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the arcmin - scale elongated radio halo of hess  j1943 + 213  discovered by @xcite would be similarly in conflict with the binary scenario .",
    "the analysis of the _ suzaku _  data presented in this paper does not add any new conclusive piece of evidence to the above discussion , as no orbital modulation has been detected in our new x - ray exposure .",
    "however , the _ wise _  and especially _ ukidss _  detections of the infrared counterpart of hess  j1943 + 213  discussed in this paper , with the resulting fluxes below the previous upper limits , would push the distance of the presumed o - type stellar companion of the high - energy source even outside the 25kpc radius , making the hmxb hypothesis even less plausible .    in the framework of the pwn model , no extension of the source in the h.e.s.s .",
    "data together with the vhe / x - ray luminosity ratio @xmath121 would imply a young age ( @xmath122yr ) and a relatively high , crab - like spin - down power ( @xmath123ergs@xmath11 ) of the system located within @xmath124kpc @xcite . on the other hand , the soft vhe spectrum and the point - like appearance of the source in the _ chandra _  data question to some extent the pwn nature of hess  j1943 + 213 .",
    "in addition , based on the absorption spectrum , @xcite argued for the source distance exceeding 16kpc .",
    "these objections have been addressed by @xcite who , based on the newly acquired evn and archival vla data , argued that the discussed object can still be a pwn left over after a supernova explosion that happened in a low - density environment at the distance of @xmath125kpc . the fact that the x - ray counterpart of hess  j1943 + 213  appears point - like for _ suzaku_-xis and unresolved even by _",
    "chandra _",
    "is not any strong argument against the pwn hypothesis .",
    "however , the presence of a bright flat - spectrum mid- to near - infrared counterpart , as discussed in this paper , is unexpected for a pwn .",
    "a comparison of high - energy spectral properties between hess  j1943 + 213  and bona fide extreme hbls is summarized in table  [ table_ehbls ] and discussed in more detail in the next section by means of a spectral model comparison with 1es  0347@xmath0121 .",
    "this comparison indicates that the multi - wavelength spectral properties of hess  j1943 + 213  are in principle consistent with it being a member of this class , even taking into account the hard , broad - band x - ray continuum and a very weak gev emission of the source .",
    "the amorphous arcmin - scale radio halo surrounding the target @xcite would fit this interpretation as well , since the previous vla studies revealed the presence of analogous features in several bl lacs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the lack of x - ray variability implied by different x - ray pointings spread over several years , including our new _ suzaku _  observations as well as the continuous _ swift_-bat monitoring , may however cast doubt on the blazar identification .",
    "in addition , @xcite noted that the brightness temperature of the hess  j1943 + 213  radio core , @xmath126 k , is much lower than those typically measured in radio cores of blazars , and bl lacs in particular .",
    "while the steady x - ray emission of the target could be explained by a particular duty cycle of hbls , which seem to be able to undergo extended periods of quiescence ( see in this context , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for 1es  0229 + 200  and pks 0548 - 322 , respectively ) , the relatively low radio brightness temperature  if intrinsic to the source instead of being due to a small - angular size scattering cloud on the line - of - sight within the galaxy ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* )  may indeed be considered as problematic for the blazar hypothesis .",
    "we however note in this context that , on the other hand , no superluminal velocities have been found in the tev - bright hbls on milli - arcsec scales , despite several dedicated observational programs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and yet such apparent superluminal velocities are considered to be one of the hallmark properties of blazars in general .",
    "note also that in a recent systematic @xmath511 milli - arcsecond resolution survey of radio - faint bl lacs @xcite using the very long baseline array ( _ vlba _ ) , most are characterized by faint @xmath5110 mjy radio cores with inferred brightness temperatures ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* therein ) as low as a few @xmath127k .    finally , the newly available _ wise _  and _ ukidss _  data for hess  j1943 + 213  are consistent with the spectrum of the expected host galaxy located at a larger distance : this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig:1943sed ] , where we plotted the template of a luminous elliptical placed at @xmath128mpc ( bolometric luminosity @xmath129ergs@xmath11 ; template taken from * ? ? ?",
    "as argued below , such a distance would additionally be in accord with the overall energetics of the source in the blazar scenario .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden ."
