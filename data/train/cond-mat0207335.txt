    "the blume - capel model ( bc ) was originally proposed to study the first - order magnetic phase transitions in spin@xmath9 ising systems [ 1 ] .",
    "this model was generalised to the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) to study phase separation and superfluity in @xmath10he-@xmath11he mixtures [ 2 ] .",
    "later it has been applied to describe properties of multicomponent fluids [ 3 ] , semiconductor alloys [ 4 ] and electronic conduction models [ 5 ] .",
    "the ( bc ) model is not exactly solvable in more than one dimension , but it has been studied over infinite @xmath12-dimensional lattices by means of many different approximate techniques and its phase diagram is well known .",
    "+ when the theory of surface critical phenomena started developing , some attention has been devoted to the study of the ( bc ) model over semi - infinite lattices , with modified surface couplings .",
    "benyoussef et al .",
    "[ 6 ] have determined the phase diagram in the mean field approximation , reporting four possible topologies at fixed bulk / surface coupling ratios . a similar analysis",
    "have also been done using a real space renormalization group transformation [ 7 ] .",
    "other works referring to particular regions of the phase space are those using : the mean field approximation [ 8 ] , the effective field approximation [ 9 ] and the low temperature expansion [ 10 ] .",
    "all these works show that it is possible to have a phase with ordered surface and disordered bulk , which is separated from the completely ordered phase by the so - called _ extraordinary _ transition and from the completely disordered phase by the _ surface _",
    "when such a phase is absent , the transition between the completely ordered and the completely disordered phase is called _",
    "ordinary_. the meeting point of the lines of these three kinds of phase transitions is named _ special _ and it is generally a multicrititcal point . as discussed in ref . [ 11 ] , the strong interest in these models arises partly from the unusually rich phase transition behaviour they display as their interaction parameters are varied , and partly from their many possible applications . in most of these cases",
    "considered so far the bilinear interaction is ferromagnetic . in the antiferromagnetic case ,",
    "the spin-@xmath0 ising systems are used to describe both the order - disorder transition and the crystallisation of the binary allow , and it was solved in the mean field approach [ 12 ] .",
    "one of the most interesting and elusive features of the mean field phase diagram for the antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath0 blume - capel model in an external magnetic field is the decomposition of a line of tricritical points into a line of critical end points and one of double critical points [ 13 ] .",
    "this model was also studied by transfer - matrix and monte carlo finite - size - scaling methods [ 14 ] , but such decomposition does not occur in this two dimensional model . on the other hand ,",
    "ferroelectric films can be described by an ising model and when the film becomes very thick , its properties are those of the semi - infinite ising system [ 15 - 17 ] . from the experimental point of view , the most commonly studied magnetic multilayers are those of ferromagnetic transition metal such as fe / ni , where the coupling can exist between magnetic layers [ 18 - 20 ] . the discovery of enormous values of magnetoresistance in magnetic multilayers are far exceeding those found in single layer films and so exceeds the discovery of oscillatory interlayer coupling in transition metal multilayers .",
    "these experimental studies have motivated much theoretical works to study magnetic thin films as well as critical phenomena [ 21 - 26 ] .",
    "this is partly motivated by the development of new growth and characterisation techniques , but perhaps more so by the discovery of many exciting new properties , some quite unanticipated .",
    "using the mean field theory , benyoussef _ et al . _",
    "[ 27 ] and boccara _ et al . _",
    "[ 28 ] have studied the spin-@xmath0 ising model with a random crystal field .",
    "+ the effect of the surface and bulk transverse fields on the phase diagrams of a semi infinite spin-@xmath0 ferromagnetic ising model with a crystal field was investigated in [ 29 ] within a finite cluster approximation with an expansion technique for cluster identities of spin-@xmath0 localised spin systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the transverse field or crystal field effects of spin-@xmath0 ising model has been studied by several authors [ 30 - 33 ] .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of a variable crystal field according to the law @xmath4 ( @xmath13 being the surface crystal field and @xmath2 the layer number from the surface and @xmath6 a positive constant ) , on the order - disorder layering transitions of a spin-@xmath0 using the mean field theory .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section @xmath14 describes the model and the method . in section",
    "@xmath15 we present results and discussions .",
    "the experimental measurements of layer - by - layer ordering phenomena have been established on free - standing liquid crystals films such as @xmath16 ( n - alkyl-4-n - alkyloxybiphenyl-4-carboxylate ) [ 34,35 ] and @xmath17 ( n - pentyl-4-n - pentanoyloxy - biphenyl-4-carboxylate ) [ 36 ] for several molecular layers .",
    "more recently , lin _ el al . _",
    "[ 37 ] have used the three - level potts model to show the existence of layer - by - layer ordering of ultra thin liquid crystal films of free - standing @xmath17 films , by adjusting the interlayer and intralayer couplings between nearest - neighbouring molecules . + the system we are studying here is formed with @xmath3 coupled ferromagnetic square layers in the presence of a crystal field .",
    "the hamiltonian governing this system is given by @xmath18 where , @xmath19 are the spin variables . the interactions between different spins are assumed to be constant so that @xmath20 .",
    "the crystal field acting on a site @xmath21 is so that @xmath22 for all spins of the layer @xmath2 so that : @xmath23 .",
    "+ using the mean field theory , the quadrupolar moment and the magnetisation of a plane @xmath2 are given , respectively , by : @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 the boltzmann constant ant @xmath29 the temperature .",
    "+ the model we are studying , in this paper , corresponds to a crystal field distributed according to the law : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is to the crystal field acting on the surface ( first layer @xmath32 ) .",
    "values of the parameter @xmath6 will be discussed in the following ; in particular @xmath33 corresponds to a uniform crystal field @xmath13 applied on each layer of the film .",
    "+ the free energy of a layer @xmath2 , can be expressed as : @xmath34 the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 still have the definitions given above . +",
    "as far as we know there is no natural compounds with decreasing crystal field from the surface to deeper layers .",
    "however , there exist a series of single crystals @xmath37 @xmath38 with a variable crystal field anisotropy . indeed , by adjusting this anisotropy for each layer so that the amplitude of the crystal field will decrease from a layer @xmath2 to the next layer @xmath39 .",
    "hence , these materials can be grown layer - by - layer in a thin film with a decreasing crystal field from the surface to deeper layers .",
    "this can lead to an experimental realisation of our model .",
    "moreover , the decreasing function considered in this model , i.e. @xmath40 , is not unique since the order - disorder layering transitions are found for any decreasing function of the crystal field from the surface to deeper layers .",
    "we are considering a system formed with @xmath3 ferromagnetic square layers of a simple cubic lattice spin@xmath9 ising model , with free boundary conditions .",
    "the notation @xmath41 will be used to denote that the first @xmath2 layers are disordered while the remaining @xmath42 layers are ordered . in particular",
    ", @xmath43 corresponds to an ordered film whereas @xmath44 denotes a totally disordered film .",
    "the surface crystal field @xmath45 , applied on each layer @xmath2 is distributed according to the law given by eq .",
    "@xmath46 . + the ground state phase diagram of this system is illustrated by fig .",
    "1 . for very small values of the surface crystal field @xmath13 ,",
    "the system orders in the phase @xmath43 .",
    "when increasing @xmath13 the surface ( first layer @xmath32 ) disorders and the phase @xmath47 occurs at @xmath48 . increasing @xmath13 more and more , the second layer @xmath49 becomes disordered at @xmath50 , and so on .",
    "the transition from the phase @xmath41 to the phase @xmath51 is seen at @xmath52 provided that @xmath53 . for higher values of the surface crystal field",
    "the system is totally disordered and the phase @xmath44 occurs .",
    "+ in particular , it is found that there exist a critical order layer @xmath7 corresponding to the transition @xmath54 , at a reduced surface crystal field given by : @xmath55 @xmath7 is exactly the number of layering transitions existing at @xmath56 .",
    "it is shown that @xmath7 depends both on the parameter @xmath6 and the film thickness @xmath3 . the special case :",
    "@xmath33 is a situation with a constant crystal field applied on each layer and there is only a single transition @xmath57 , occurring at @xmath58 for @xmath56 . +",
    "a preliminary study , for @xmath59 , @xmath15 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 layers , shows that the topology of the phase diagrams is not affected by the increasing film thickness , for a fixed exponent @xmath6 value .",
    "hence , the numerical results established in this work are done for a film with a thickness @xmath63 layers . + in order to outline the effect of the parameter @xmath6 at a fixed film thickness , we plot in figs .",
    "2a , 2b , 2c and 2d the corresponding phase diagrams for several @xmath6 values : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "+ in the case @xmath68 , fig .",
    "2a , a constant crystal field is applied on each layer and the corresponding transition @xmath57 is found at @xmath69 for very low temperatures .",
    "increasing @xmath6 values , it is seen that large values of @xmath70 are needed to disorder the film .",
    "this result is summarised in figs .",
    "2b , 2c and 2d .",
    "indeed , due to the effect of the equation law @xmath46 , separate layering transitions are found . for non null but very low temperatures ,",
    "the surface crystal field values found in the phase diagrams are exactly those predicted by the ground state study : @xmath71 for a layer order @xmath2 with @xmath72 .",
    "for example , in fig . 2c for @xmath73 , the first transition is found at @xmath74 , the second transition at @xmath75 , the third transition at @xmath76 and so on .",
    "the other numerical values of the surface crystal field corresponding to @xmath77 in fig . 2b , and @xmath78 in fig .",
    "2d are exactly those predicted by the ground state phase diagram .",
    "furthermore , figs . 2b , 2c and 2d",
    "show that the remaining @xmath79 transitions , not seen for @xmath56 , arise for higher temperature values with separate tricritical points .",
    "more over , these results ensure the existence of a critical value @xmath80 above which a layer @xmath2 disorders at a very low temperature .",
    "the reentrant phenomena , seen in these figures for a given layer @xmath2 , is caused by the competition of the temperature and an inductor magnetic field created by the deeper layers .",
    "indeed , when the thermal fluctuations become sufficiently important , the magnetisation of some spins , of deeper layers , becomes non null ( + 1 or -1 ) .",
    "this leads to the appearance of an inductor magnetic field .",
    "this magnetic field is responsible of the ordered phase seen for the layer @xmath2 .",
    "this argument can also explain the absence of the reentrant phenomena for the last layer(s ) , once the magnetisation of the remaining layer(s ) @xmath81 is not sufficient to create an inductor magnetic field .",
    "it is worth to note that the reentrant phenomena is always present for the layers @xmath2 , ( @xmath82 ) , and the corresponding tricritical points @xmath83 are located at a constant temperature .",
    "an interesting question arises at this stage : what is the effect of the parameter @xmath6 on the surface of the film ( @xmath32 ) ? to clarify this point , we illustrate in fig .",
    "3a the profiles of the critical temperature for several values of @xmath6 as a function of @xmath70 .",
    "it is found that increasing @xmath6 values leads to important reentrants phenomena .",
    "indeed , for large values of @xmath6 , the layer with @xmath84 needs higher values of the surface crystal field to disorder .",
    "it is also found that , except the special case @xmath68 , the tricritical point is not affected by variations in @xmath6 values .",
    "this surface tricritical point is located at @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath33 for a film with a thickness @xmath63 layers .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath6 on a medium layer @xmath88 is illustrated in fig .",
    "3b . the same topology is found , but higher values of @xmath70 are needed to overcome the disorder of this layer . + on the other hand , for @xmath89 the studied system is equivalent to a configuration with @xmath90 and @xmath91 : the applied crystal field is present only at the surface and absent on the bulk . the corresponding phase diagram is illustrated by fig .",
    "only two transitions are present in this case : @xmath92 , occurring for low temperatures at @xmath74 , and @xmath93 occurring at a constant temperature @xmath94 and any non null surface crystal field value . in order to complete this study ,",
    "we illustrate in fig . 5 , the thermal behaviour of the surface magnetisation for @xmath95 and selected values of @xmath6 : 0.0 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 1.0 and 2.0 .",
    "at this surface crystal field value , the increasing @xmath6 values effect is to increase both the surface magnetisation amplitude and the critical temperature needed to disorder this layer .",
    "this is a consequence of the factor @xmath96 effect for @xmath84 , as it has been anticipated in the discussion above .",
    "we have studied the effect of a variable crystal field according to the law eq . ( 4 ) , and found order - disorder layering transitions of the blume - capel ising model using mean field theory .",
    "we found a reentrant phenomena for each layer @xmath2 ( @xmath82 , see text ) , and a tricritical point at a fixed temperature with a vertical first order line .",
    "we established the temperature - crystal field phase diagrams and found that the last layer tricritical point depend strongly on the small values of the exponent @xmath6 for a fixed film thickness .",
    "the thermal behaviour of the surface magnetisation has also been investigated .      1",
