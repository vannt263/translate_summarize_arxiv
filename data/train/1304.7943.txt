    "the morphology of the martensitic microstructures is strongly related to the mechanical properties of steel and alloys .",
    "it is important to predict the formation of the martensitic microstructure precisely .",
    "furthermore , during the mt the incremental elastic strain energy is reduced by the formation of a heterogeneous array of different orientation variants of the martensitic phase and by plastic accommodation .",
    "the development of appropriate models allows to calculate the strains associated with the phase transformation .",
    "the understanding and control of localized plasticity and its interaction with the transformation front is quite essential e.g. for trip - steels and shape memory alloys @xcite .",
    "recently , phase - field ( pf ) models have been extensively studied as a powerful tool for predicting microstructural evolution and applied to the martensitic transformation .",
    "khachaturyan and co - workers developed the phase - field microelasticity ( pfm ) theory @xcite , which integrates the microelasticity into the phase - field model employing the fast fourier transform algorithm .",
    "the model was further applied to investigate the mt in single crystals @xcite and polycrystalline systems @xcite as well as in multilayer systems under applied stresses @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully applied to various coherent phase transformations including the prediction of many complicated strain - induced morphological patterns @xcite . resolving the individual martensite plates",
    "the pf approach differs from the phenomenological martensitic transformation modeling of irreversible processes in various representations : local , crystalline and mean - field @xcite , which are widely used in the simulation of shape memory alloys and trip - steels due to their simplicity and efficient incorporation of elasto - plastic effects on mesoscale . to understand the mechanism of nucleation and growth conditions of martensitic plates inside an inhomogeneous plastic strain field the number of theoretical models",
    "were developed @xcite .",
    "these models include the dislocation theory of the martensitic interfacial structure and introduce a driving force of interface propagation in inelastic materials .    besides the coherent phase transformations the mt in technical alloys",
    "is usually associated with plastic strains .",
    "the effect of plasticity , which can be represented as the generation and the motion of dislocations during the mt , is very complex . on the one hand ,",
    "if the mt is caused by applied loads , the evolution of the plastic deformation reduces the driving force of the transformation . on the other hand ,",
    "a local plastic relaxation allows the accommodation of the strain caused by the mt and the nucleation and growth of new martensitic variants . finally , statistically stored dislocations are an irreversible structural change which affect the energy landscape by their own elastic fields .",
    "thus , a general phase - field model for mt should include not only the driving forces originating from the elastic fields , but also the effects resulting from the plastic strain fields .",
    "the plastic activity in the phase - field theory has already been treated by modeling the individual dislocations @xcite and their coupling dynamics @xcite . a phase - field model of the evolution of a dislocation system due to the evolution of dislocation order parameters based on the time depending ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation was developed by wang et  al .",
    "@xcite . at the same time ,",
    "koslowski et  al .",
    "@xcite formulated a phase - field theory of the dislocation dynamics for an arbitrary number and arrangement of dislocation lines based on a general framework for dissipative systems .",
    "the plastic deformation can also be added to the phase - field model by introducing a plastic strain field defined at the mesoscale .",
    "a version of this approach has been recently proposed by zhou et al .",
    "@xcite , where the plastic strain is related to the inter - dislocation distance .",
    "the evolution of the dislocation phase fields is described by the tdgl equation similar to the evolution of the martensitic phase fields , where the driving force is the elastic shear energy density relaxed by the plastic strain .",
    "the difference to the individual dislocation dynamic models is that the model proposed by zhou et al . describes the evolution of dislocation order parameters related to the slip systems of the crystal .    in recent years",
    "a similar approach for the simulations of the evolution of the martensitic phase transformations and the dislocation order parameters by the tdgl equations was developed by levitas and javanbakht @xcite .",
    "the phase field approach was applied to interaction of the phase transformation and the individual dislocation evolution @xcite . as a result a number of model problems of the stress - induced phase - transformations interacting with dislocation evolution were solved .",
    "it is also important that in the work @xcite the general phase - field theory for multivariant martensitic phase transformations and explicit models have been formulated for the most general case of large strains .",
    "the general thermodynamic approach allows to determine the driving force for the change of the order parameters and the boundary conditions for the order parameters .",
    "moreover , it allows to calculate correct interface stresses and to elucidate the importance of the interface width @xcite .",
    "remarkable is that levitas et  al .",
    "previously already developed a finite - strain - continuum thermomechanical approach to simulate the transformation - induced stress and plastic strain fields @xcite based on a theory of martensitic phase transformations developed earlier by levitas @xcite .",
    "another simplified version of this approach has been derived by yamanaka @xcite based on the pf microelasticity theory and the elasto - plastic pf model suggested by guo et al .",
    "@xcite which not take into account different slip systems . in recent years elasto - plastic phase - field models of the martensitic transformation using similar evolution equations for the plastic strain have been developed by koyama s group @xcite .",
    "this approach also follow h.k .",

    "@xcite for the phase - field modeling of the martensitic microstructure evolution in steels by using the elasto - plastic finite - element method .",
    "further , yamanaka et  al .",
    "@xcite proposed the model to describe the austenite - to - ferrite transformation , where the mesoscale crystal plasticity theory is used @xcite .",
    "they combine the crystal plasticity finite element method with the multi - phase - field method to simulate the austenite - to - ferrite transformation with the diffusion of carbon atoms in low carbon steels .    to describe the plastic deformation in single crystals many models use the crystal plasticity framework in which the evolution of plastic strain is described by means of an elastic driving force . a microstructural strain - hardening model suitable for crystal plasticity simulations developed by ma and roters @xcite has recently made remarkable progress and allows the numerical study of deformation processes on the basis of the thermally activated dislocation evolution",
    "the model preserves the crystallographic features of dislocation slip processes and captures the commonly accepted concepts of dislocation processes in the plastic deformation , especially various dislocation interaction processes as interactions of mobile and statistically stored dislocations , the formation of locks and dipoles or the thermal and athermal annihilation in a continuum dislocation density framework .",
    "the original concept @xcite for fcc single crystals has been extended to polycrystals , considering grain boundary interactions and geometrically necessary dislocations as well as the extension to dislocations in bcc crystals @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a number of other works have been published recently , which couple the phase - field simulation with crystal plasticity schemes at the mesoscale @xcite and do not take into account the plastic accommodation caused directly by the solid - solid transformation .",
    "crystal plasticity models , their further developments based on microscopically interpretable state - variables and their evolution based on sound physical principles are very attractive for the coupling with solid - solid phase transitions and offer new research directions and new insights into the mechanisms of martensitic phase transformations .",
    "one contribution in this direction is the work of kundin  et al .",
    "@xcite , where the crystal plasticity model is coupled to the phase - field model of the mt that allows to resolve the dynamics of individual martensitic plates .",
    "the coupling model also uses methods of earlier models for the simulation of the transformation induced plasticity @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the formation of special martensite morphologies ( butterfly type ) in a fe-31@xmath0ni is assisted by the formation of plastic strain fields in the austenitic matrix , which then are inherited by the growing martensitic plates .",
    "this phenomenon was experimentally observed in the works @xcite and investigated numerically later in work @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the current paper is to understand the evolution of the dislocations during the mt and the interaction of the plastic strain with the transformation front .",
    "the kinetic of the mt is described by the elasto - plastic pf model of the mt .",
    "the dislocations are treated as separate dislocation fields .",
    "we consider their evolution using the model of thermally activated dislocation motion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we take into account three main processes : the generation and annihilation of the dislocations in the austenitic matrix and the annihilation of the dislocations on the propagating martensitic front . in our investigation",
    "we concentrate on the inheritance of the dislocations by the martensitic phase .",
    "the previous work in this direction is the paper of ostwald et al .",
    "@xcite , where the authors introduced an inheritance probability function for the quantitative description of the inheritance process , which is equal to the fraction of the inherited dislocation density . to describe the inheritance mechanism in our model the probability of the dislocation inheritance",
    "is defined as the fraction of the remaining dislocation density after the annihilation on the transformation front .",
    "we first start with recalling the phase - field microelasticity model of the mt extended by taking into account plastic strains in section 2 .",
    "the differential equation describing the evolution of plastic strains and dislocation density is presented in sections 2.3 .",
    "the coupling of the phase - transformation and the plasticity effects is incorporated in one algorithm .",
    "details on the numerical investigation of the interaction between the transformation front and the plastic strain are provided in section 3 , where the model is applied to a a fe-30@xmath0ni alloy .",
    "in addition the resulting effect on the inheritance kinetics was predicted by the suggested model and compared with the reported data , when various phase - field model parameters are applied .",
    "following the concept developed in the pfm theory @xcite we consider a coherent multi - phase mixture with the order parameters @xmath1 and the local stress - free strain tensor @xmath2 where @xmath3 identifies a crystallographic variant .",
    "the order parameters are treated as phase - field variables so that @xmath4 $ ] and satisfy the property @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the phase - field variable responsible for the presence of the austenite .",
    "the dislocations are characterized by a burgers vector @xmath7 and a slip plane with a normal @xmath8 defined by the crystallography of the austenitic ( or martensitic ) phase . here , @xmath9 is an index corresponding to a slip system .",
    "we can define a dimensionless dislocation function through the dislocation densities of mobile , @xmath10 , and immobile , @xmath11 , dislocations @xmath12 as an analog of a phase - field variable .",
    "it is equal to the unity if the distance between the dislocations in the full volume is equal to the burgers vector .",
    "the local stress - free plastic strain tensor caused by moving dislocations of an @xmath9-th slip system is given then by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the plastic shear and @xmath15 is the schmid tensor for a slip system @xmath9 defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the unit vector in the direction of the burgers vector , which expresses the slip direction .      the formulation of the total free energy of a system as a function of the order parameters is the key step in the development of phase - field models . in the standard phase - field formulation",
    "the total free energy is divided into three terms : the gradient energy term , the double well potential term ( both terms are responsible for the interface energy ) and the chemical free energy that provides the chemical driving force for the transformation",
    ". concerning the mt , there are an additional elastic strain energy that suppresses or accelerates the transformation .",
    "the chemical free energy and the double well potential term in pfm theory of the mt are usually considered together and approximated by a landau polynomial expansion with respect to the order parameters @xcite .    in the present study",
    "we reformulate the pfm theory in terms of the standard phase - field modeling @xcite .",

    "the term @xmath27 is responsible for the resistance exerting by dislocations , @xmath28 is a scaling parameter .    the first term on the right hand site of eq .",
    "( [ kineticeq ] ) is the gradient term , which forces interfaces to have a finite width .",
    "the second term is the double potential function and the third term is the driving force .",

    "the model function @xmath36 is the double well potential and is defined as follows @xmath37 the function @xmath38 is responsible for the chemical driving force and defined as @xmath39 these model functions serve the goal to keep the order parameters between 0 and 1 . in appendix",
    "a we show that the chosen model functions satisfy the properties of the standard phase - field model and derive their relation to the landau polynomial expansion usually used in pfm theory .",
    "the undercooling responsible for the chemical driving force is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are is the latent heat and @xmath43 is the temperature of the mt , respectively .      in this section",
    "we describe the time evolution of the dislocation density generated during the mt and the evolution of the plastic deformation strain . the plastic strain and",
    "the dislocation density will first evolve in the austenitic phase .",
    "then , due to the interaction with the transformation front , one part of the dislocations will cross the interface without or with small changes of the slip system and will be inherited in the martensite .",
    "the other part of the dislocation will annihilate by the interaction with the dislocations of the same slip system collected at the transformation front .",
    "the kinetics of these processes depends on the growth velocity of the transformation front and the resistance stress of the matrix .",
    "it should also be taken into account that a part of the dislocations annihilates in the bulk phase . in",
    "the following we consider a single crystal system , i.e. a system which contains only one grain without boundaries .    to describe the evolution of the dislocation density in time and space a reaction - diffusion model was developed by walgraef and aifantis @xcite .",
    "they proposed a general balance equation for dislocation dynamics @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dislocation flux . in past years",
    "this model has initiated the development of many analogous models .",
    "the limitations of these models were considered in @xcite and it was shown that if the homogenization length for the dislocation density is taken smaller than the critical reaction distance between the dislocations the transport term at the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ balance ] ) becomes very important . in our simulations in section [ section_numerical_simulation ]",
    "we have a system size in the order of 0.1 @xmath26 m and the distance between the dislocations in the beginning of the microstructure evolution is larger or in the same order . during the mt",
    "the distance decreases down to 10 nm , that is in the order of martensitic layer size .",
    "but it is still larger than the interface width ( @xmath46 = 2 nm ) and discrete dislocations should be used .",
    "this scaling is typical for all previous elasto - plastic phase - field models using the continuum dislocation fields . in order to minimize this drawback we suggest to take into account additional gradient terms in the evolution equation ( see below ) .    in this section",
    "we use the theory of the dislocation evolution presented in @xcite and extend it by inserting dislocation flux terms in the gradient form .",
    "we define additionally to the mobile and immobile dislocations the parallel dislocation density @xmath47 and the forest dislocation density @xmath48 for a slip system @xmath9 as @xmath49 @xmath50 the density of the mobile dislocations is calculated as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the shear modulus , @xmath53 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath43 is the temperature and @xmath54,@xmath55,@xmath56 are material constants . the density of the mobile dislocations collected on the transformation front , @xmath57 , is calculated as an average dislocation density in the austenite over space and time .",
    "then we calculate the evolution of the immobile dislocation density as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the plastic shear rate , @xmath60 is the activation energy for climb , @xmath61 is the external stress .",
    "( [ densevolution ] ) combines three processes in the bulk phase : immobilization of the mobile dislocations , non - thermal annihilation with the immobile dislocations of the same slip system and thermal annihilation by climb of edge dislocations with material constants @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the probability of these processes are governed by the plastic shear rate @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , we propose an additional term with a constant @xmath65 , which is responsible for the non - thermal annihilation of the mobile dislocations at the martensitic transformation front with immobile dislocations in the matrix .",
    "the probability of this process is proportional to the local dislocation densities and the velocity of the mt front , which is related to the evolution of the order parameter @xmath66 .",
    "the physical meaning of this term is that the transformation front collects the mobile dislocations , which can later annihilate with the immobile dislocations of the same slip system during the front propagation .",
    "the released mobile dislocations will be pushed forward by the mt front .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the collection of the dislocations on the front should rise with the increasing transformation rate .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 is a phenomenological parameter , which should be justified experimentally . in the following",
    "we will call the annihilation at the mt front as the annihilation term .",
    "note that the model parameter @xmath65 is strongly connected to the interface width @xmath32 due to the integration over the phase - field diffuse interface .",
    "that is why an appropriate choice of the interface width @xmath32 which is related to the discretization size @xmath67 is very important .",
    "the diffuse interface in phase - field model is used for the modeling of the moving boundary .",
    "we use the properties of the diffuse interface to simulate the annihilation process on the moving transformation front . to estimate the average annihilation rate",
    "we should take the integral of the annihilation term over the simulation domain .",
    "the average annihilation term will depend on the product @xmath68 which is the average front velocity and will be inverse proportional to the distance between the martensite - austenite boundaries , @xmath69 .",
    "hence the annihilation term depends on physical parameters of the system and does not depend on numerical effects .    the last gradient term in ( [ densevolution ] ) is added as the transport term required in the reaction - diffusion model @xcite to guarantee the homogeneous distribution of the dislocations and a smooth transition of the dislocation field profile across the martensite - austenite boundaries .",
    "a similar term was used in the models which deal with the dislocation evolution by tdgl equation @xcite .",
    "the plastic shear rate can be defined according to the orowan equation as @xmath70 where we assume that the plastic deformation is hindered in the martensite due to much higher flow stresses compared to the austenite .",
    "we describe the evolution of plastic slip during the process only in the austenitic phase and multiply the plastic shear rate with @xmath71 .",
