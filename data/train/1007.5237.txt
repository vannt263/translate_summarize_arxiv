    "at a distance of 4.5 mpc , m83 , nicknamed the `` southern pinwheel , '' is the nearest massive grand - design spiral galaxy .",
    "it is a mildly barred galaxy , with a hubble type sab(s)c .",
    "less famous than its northern counterparts m51 ( 8.2 mpc ) and m101 ( 7.4 mpc ) , m83 has been less studied in general . in this work ,",
    "we use observations taken with the wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) to study this galaxy in unprecedented detail .",
    "the combination of higher spatial resolution , extensive wavelength coverage , and improved photometric accuracy , especially in the ultraviolet and near - ir , make these the best observations of a grand - design spiral galaxy ever taken .",
    "the wfc3 was designed to cover a wavelength range from @xmath15  to @xmath16 , unprecedented for any instrument on - board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "following in the legacy of wfpc1 , wfpc2 , and acs , the wfc3 has @xmath1750 times the discovery efficiency ( quantum efficiency @xmath18 field of view ) in the uv of either wfpc2 or acs .",
    "similarly , wfc3 has @xmath1730 times the discovery efficiency in the near - ir of nicmos .",
    "the wfc3 science oversight committee ( soc ) has been granted @xmath17200 orbits of non - proprietary data , and roughly half of this allocation has been used to study star formation in different environments in the nearby universe ( early release science project # 1 ; ers1 ) .",
    "investigating star formation takes advantage of the sensitivity of wfc3 in both the uv and near - ir , since most of the light from young massive stars is produced in the uv , yet obscuration from dust can hamper the study of the youngest star forming regions .",
    "ten targets ( ngc  3603 , 30  dor , m82 , ngc  4214 , ngc  5128 , m83 , ngc  2841 , ngc  4150 , ngc  4592 , and m85 ) were selected as representatives of a wide range of environments and distances , ranging from 6  kpc for the massive , young star cluster ngc  3603 in our own galaxy to 15.3 mpc for the galaxy m85 .",
    "more details about the ers1 project , and its counterpart ers2 ( `` panchromatic wfc3 survey of galaxies at intermediate z '' ) , can be found at : http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/docs/wfc3-ers .",
    "a complement of seven broad - band filters , ranging from the uv ( f225w ) to the near - ir ( f160w ) , and seven narrow - band filters , ranging from f373n [ oiii ] to f164n [ feii ] , were used to image a field covering the starburst nucleus of m83 , in order to take advantage of the panchromatic capabilities of wfc3 .",
    "the broad - band filters provide estimates for the physical properties of the stars and star clusters , including luminosity , age , mass , and extinction .",
    "the narrow band filters provide estimates of physical properties in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , including shock diagnostics , ionization parameters , and abundances .",
    "the spatial resolution of wfc3 is slightly better than that of its predecessors ( i.e. , @xmath19  pix@xmath20 compared to @xmath21  pix@xmath20 in acs ; @xmath22  pix@xmath20 in the near - ir compared to @xmath23  pix@xmath20 for the nic3 camera on nicmos ) . a second , adjacent field just to the north has just been observed with the same set of filters .",
    "dopita ( 2010 ) used the same dataset as used here to detect and study 60 supernovae remnants ( snrs ) in m83 . in future papers we will present the age distribution for compact star clusters in m83 in more detail ( chandar in preparation ) , the distribution of cluster and association sizes ( kaleida in preparation ) , the infrared properties of the stars and clusters ( whitmore in preparation ) , the star formation history of m83 from individual ( field ) stars ( kim in preparation ) , and the population of hii regions , and the characteristics of dust attenuation and shock ionization in the ism ( calzetti in preparation ) .    in this paper we determine the luminosity function of compact star clusters in m83 .",
    "we provide a quantitative assessment of the impact that various corrections and different methods for selecting clusters and separating them from stars have on the results . we also present preliminary mass and age distributions for the clusters .",
    "we address the following specific questions in this paper : ( 1 )  are the cluster luminosity and mass functions well described by power - laws ? ( 2 )",
    "does the shape of the luminosity function depend on environment ( e.g. , nuclear vs.  non - nuclear region ) or on age ( e.g. , selected by color ) ? ( 3 )  to what degree is the shape of the luminosity function affected by the method used to select the clusters , by the wavelength of the filters , by binning or by aperture corrections ? ( 4 )  what is the shape of the age distribution for clusters in m83 ? ( 5 )  is there any evidence for a physical upper mass limit with which clusters can form or for the faster disruption of lower mass clusters when compared with higher mass clusters ( i.e. , for bends in the mass function at the high or low mass end ) ?",
    "the plan for the rest of this paper is as follows : section  2 presents the observations and basic photometry ; section  3 describes the procedures used to select the star clusters , and compares results for automatically and manually selected catalogs ; section  4 presents the luminosity function for the clusters and assesses the impact of selection , binning , filter , and aperture correction , and section  5 presents preliminary mass and age distributions .",
    "section  6 discusses the shape of these distributions in terms of the formation and disruption of the clusters .",
    "we summarize our main results in section  7 .",
    "observations of a @xmath24  kpc@xmath25 portion of m83 were made with the wfc3 on _ hst _ , as part of the ers1 program 11360 ( pi : oconnell ) in august , 2009 , in the following broad - band filters : f225w ( `` @xmath26 '' ; 1800 sec ) , f336w ( `` @xmath0 '' ; 1890 sec ) , f438w ( `` @xmath27 '' ; 1180 sec ) , f555w ( `` @xmath28 '' ; 1203 sec ) , f814w ( `` @xmath29 '' ; 1203 sec ) , f110w ( `` @xmath30 '' ; 1798 sec ) , and f160w ( `` @xmath31 '' ; 1798 sec ) .",
    "additional observations were made in narrow - band filters covering the following lines : [ oiii ] ( f373n ; 2400 sec ) , h@xmath32 ( f487n ; 2700 sec ) , [ oii ] ( f502n ; 2484 sec ) , h@xmath4 ( f657n ; 1484 sec ) , [ sii ] ( f673n ; 1850 sec ) , paschen@xmath32 ( f128n ; 1198 sec ) and [ feii ] ( f164n ; 2398 sec ) .",
    "three or four separate exposures were taken at different dithered positions for each of the broad- and narrow - band filters .",
    "in addition to the longer exposures , short 10 sec exposures were taken in the f439w , f555w , and f814w filters to obtain photometry for objects that saturated in the long exposures .",
    "we focus here on the _ ubvi_,h@xmath4 observations . in this work ,",
    "we assume a distance of @xmath33  mpc to m83 ( thim et  al .",
    "2003 ) , corresponding to a distance modulus of @xmath34 .",
    "this yields a pixel scale of 0.876 pc  pix@xmath20 .",
    "the flatfielded wfc3/uvis images in each filter were co - added using the multidrizzle task ( koekemoer et  al .",
    "2002 ) , with a final pixel scale of @xmath35  pix@xmath20 ( based on the best calibration available for wfc3 at the time the data were reduced , and accurate to @xmath36% . ) a color image of the observed m83 field is shown in figure  [ fig : colorimage ] .",
    "the field covers the nuclear starburst region in m83 , as well as a portion of a spiral arm and the inter - arm region .",
    "figure  [ fig : nuclearimage ] is an enlargement of the nuclear region , and shows that recent star formation has cleared out most of the dust over much of the area .",
    "a dust lane along the inner edge of the spiral arm is seen to the north and west of the nucleus , which appears as the yellowish object in the upper left of the image .",
    "figure  [ fig : triangle_region ] shows an enlargement of a typical portion of our field outside of the nuclear region , including three large star - forming complexes containing compact star clusters .",
    "in order to detect as many sources as possible , we aligned and co - added together the final , drizzled broad - band images in the @xmath0 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 filters , based on rms - normalized images to give roughly equal weight to all wavelengths . this procedure allows us to include objects that are very blue or very red in our source list , such as blue and red supergiant stars , that might otherwise be missing in any single filter . using a median - divided version of the `` white light '' image ( see discussion in miller 1997 )",
    ", we identified all sources , both point - like and slightly extended , using the iraf task daofind .",
    "this resulted in a total list of @xmath37 objects , which includes a combination of individual stars , close blends of a few stars , star clusters , and background galaxies .",
    "we perform circular aperture photometry of all detected sources on the drizzled images for each filter using the iraf task phot , using an aperture radius of 3 pixels and a background annulus between 10 and 13 pixels .",
    "we have checked , however , that our results for the luminosity and mass functions are not sensitive to the exact choice of aperture . for the narrow - band f657n ( @xmath38 ) image , we perform photometry on the drizzled image without subtracting the stellar continuum flux .",
    "we convert the instrumental magnitudes to the vegamag magnitude system by applying the following zeropoints : f336w = 23.46 , f438w = 24.98 , f555w = 25.81 , f657n = 22.35 , and f814w = 24.67 , which are provided by stsci at the following url : http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/phot_zp_lbn .",
    "we will loosely refer to these as `` @xmath26 , '' `` @xmath0,''``@xmath27 , '' `` @xmath28 , '' and `` @xmath29 '' band magnitudes , although we do not make any transformations to the johnson - cousins system .",
    "we use two different approaches to determine aperture corrections , which convert our fixed aperture magnitudes to total magnitudes .",
    "both approaches make use of the concentration index ( @xmath39 ) , measured in the @xmath28 band image and defined as the difference in aperture magnitudes determined using a 3 pix and a 0.5 pix radius . in the first approach , a single value ( 0.30 )",
    "is used for the aperture correction of point sources ( i.e. , objects with @xmath40 ) , and a different value ( 0.98 ) is used for extended sources ( objects with @xmath41 ) in each filter .",
    "these mean aperture corrections are determined from the magnitude difference between apertures of 3 and 12.5  pixel ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) for a sample of @xmath17 50 relatively isolated , high s / n stars and clusters .",
    "we assume an additional 0.10 mag is needed to correct the photometry from @xmath42 to infinity , based on new measurements for wfc3 .",
    "this assumption is good to a few percent and is dominated by the aperture correction , in any case .",
    "a weakness of this approach is that by adopting a single value of the aperture correction for all clusters , we overestimate the total luminosity of more compact clusters and underestimate the total luminosity of more extended clusters .",
    "our second approach applies aperture corrections to each object based on its measured size ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "unresolved objects ( those with @xmath40 ) all receive a single , filter - dependent aperture correction ( 0.30 ) . for extended objects , we find the following relationship between aperture correction and @xmath39 , for the range @xmath43 : @xmath44 .",
    "this relationship was determined by adding artificial star clusters of varying size , using the mksynth task in the baolab package ( larsen 1999 ) , to a relatively uncrowded portion of the m83 image , and measuring their @xmath39 values and aperture corrections .",
    "a weakness of this approach is that values of @xmath39 can be quite uncertain for objects in crowded regions , where for example a compact cluster with a close neighbor can have an artificially large value of @xmath39 , resulting in a too - high aperture correction , and leading to larger uncertainties in the luminosities determined for these clusters .",
    "finally , we note that our color determinations use aperture magnitudes rather than the more uncertain total magnitudes .",
    "the selection of star clusters from observations that contain both individual stars and clusters is one of the most important steps for many studies of extragalactic cluster systems . in some cases the results of a study",
    "can be pre - determined , or at least strongly biased , by decisions made at this early phase of the analysis .",
    "one common situation is that samples of extragalactic clusters are far less complete at the youngest ages ( @xmath45  yr ) than at older ages , because clusters tend to form in crowded regions where it is difficult to separate clusters from individual stars .",
    "these types of bias need to be accounted for since they can severely affect the luminosity , mass and age distributions of the clusters .    in our past work",
    "we have found that constructing `` training sets '' of stars and clusters is important for determining the best set of parameters to use for separating these objects ( e.g. , whitmore 2010 ) . following this approach , we identified two training sets of objects in relatively isolated regions : a set of individual , point - like stars and a set of clearly extended , compact star clusters .",
    "the top panel in figure  [ fig : trainingci ] shows that the concentration index @xmath39 cleanly separates these objects , with stars having @xmath46 , and clusters having @xmath41 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the corresponding figure for all objects brighter than @xmath47 . here",
    ", the clean separation between stars and clusters evident for luminous isolated objects fills in at fainter magnitudes .",
    "we note that clusters dominate over stars in number at magnitudes brighter than @xmath48 , are comparable in number for @xmath49 , and stars dominate over clusters at magnitudes fainter than @xmath47 .",
    "we also note that most of the objects with @xmath50 in figure  [ fig : trainingci ] are actually faint stars with bright nearby companions ( see  3.2.1 ) , where the @xmath39 index is not able to measure the `` size '' accurately .",
    "only 3% of the objects in figure  [ fig : trainingci ] which are brighter than @xmath51 fall into this category .",
    "in addition to @xmath39 , we have used the _ ishape _",
    "software , developed by s.  larsen ( larsen 1999 ) to measure the sizes of objects .",
    "the @xmath39 index is a very simple method which works fairly well for most clusters ( as discussed above ) .",
    "it is often more robust than more sophisticated methods , especially in crowded regions and for faint objects .",
    "however , @xmath39 is also a fairly crude measure of object size , one which is less accurate than _ ishape _ for isolated stars and clusters .",
    "_ ishape _ convolves analytic profiles with different values of the effective radius , @xmath52 ( representing the surface brightness distribution of a star cluster ) with the psf , and determines the best fit to each source .",
    "we create a psf in the f555w image from @xmath53 relatively bright , isolated point sources , and use _ ishape _ to measure the @xmath52 of each source assuming a king profile ( king 1966 ) , with a ratio of tidal to core radius of 30 , based on the flux within a 5 pixel radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : ishape ] shows a reasonably good correlation between @xmath39 and _ ishape _ measurements for the sizes of clusters in our manually selected catalog ( described in section  3.2.2 ) , although the @xmath39 values `` saturate , '' i.e. , stop increasing , before @xmath52 measured by _",
    "ishape _ does .",
    "the size distribution of the clusters , along with correlations between the sizes , ages , and masses of clusters in m83 , will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "optical colors , in addition to object size , can help to distinguish clusters from stars , as demonstrated in the antennae galaxies by whitmore ( 2010 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : single_color ] we first compare @xmath54 vs.  @xmath55 colors for clusters brighter than @xmath56 from our daophot catalog ( described in section  3.2.1 ) , with new single stellar population model predictions from charlot & bruzual ( 2009 ; hereafter cb09 , private communication ; also see bruzual & charlot 2003 ) which use the wfc3 filter transmission curves .",
    "the colors and luminosities have been corrected for reddening and extinction in the milky way ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; schlegel 1998 ) but not in m83 .",
    "we show predictions from models with @xmath59solar metallicity ( the inner portions of m83 have super - solar abundance ; bresolin et  al .",
    "we note the overall exquisite match between the observations and the models , greatly surpassing those of past observations in the @xmath0 band using wfpc2 .",
    "this bodes well for our ability to age - date the clusters , which is discussed in section  5 .",
    "next , we compare predicted colors for luminous stars from the padova group ( e.g. , girardi et  al .",
    "2002 ; marigo et  al .",
    "2008 ) , shown as the small filled circles in the upper - right panel of figure  [ fig : stvscl1 ] , with the predicted cluster colors . predicted colors for the stars begin at roughly the same location as for the youngest clusters , in the upper left portion of the two - color diagram , but the two tracks separate for clusters older than @xmath60  yr , when red supergiants begin to appear .",
    "we use the models as a guide to define four different regions of two - color space :    \\(1 ) `` cluster space '' : region of two - color space unique to clusters ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 )    \\(2 ) `` star / cluster space '' : region of two - color space containing both very young clusters and very blue stars ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 )    \\(3 ) `` blue - star space '' : region of two - color space unique to luminous , blue stars ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 )    \\(4 ) `` yellow - star space '' : region of two - color space unique to luminous , yellow stars ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 )    these four regions are somewhat different than those used in the antennae by whitmore ( 2010 ) , primarily because of the significantly higher quality of the @xmath0 band observations provided by wfc3 compared with wfpc2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : stvscl1 ] shows a series of two - color diagrams , divided into four different intervals of luminosity ( down to @xmath69 ) .",
    "the first two columns show our best ( `` daophot''see section  3.2 ) catalog of star clusters in the non - nuclear ( left ) and nuclear ( middle ) regions , while the last column shows candidate stars , selected to have @xmath46 .",
    "note how most of the stars in the bottom right panels of figure  [ fig : stvscl1 ] follow each bend in the padova models almost exactly , with modest amounts of reddening moving some of the points slightly to the right of the models .",
    "there are however , a number of luminous stars ( e.g. , see the second panel down on the right ) that are well to the right of the padova models .",
    "we believe that these may be relatively rare , luminous blue variable stars ( lbvs ) in m83 , since they have colors and luminosities similar to lbvs in the galaxy and magellanic clouds .",
    "for example , three of the best known lbvs , eta carina , p  cygni , and s  doradus , have median colors of @xmath70 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 between @xmath73 and @xmath74  mag .",
    "the properties of luminous stars in m83 will be studied in more detail in kim et  al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "a comparison between the two - color diagrams for clusters in the non - nuclear and nuclear regions ( first and second column in figure  [ fig : stvscl1 ] , respectively ) , shows strong similarities . in particular , the fraction of objects in each of the four regions of the two - color diagram , indicated in the figure , are within @xmath1710% of each other .",
    "this implies that the color distribution of the clusters is similar in the two regions .",
    "one difference is the higher extinction for many of the clusters in the nuclear region , which lie primarily along the reddening vector rather than on the model curves themselves .",
    "another difference is the larger scatter relative to the models and the smaller number of faint clusters in the nuclear region , as expected due to the higher background and hence lower completeness of the sample .",
    "we can use figure  [ fig : stvscl1 ] to assess how well our size - based ( @xmath39 ) selection of clusters works .",
    "we find that 6080% of the resolved objects ( candidate clusters ) fall in cluster - space , while 2040% fall in star / cluster space , independent of magnitude . out of 189 candidate clusters",
    "selected based on size , only 1 ( 1% ) fall ( just barely ) in yellow star - space , and only 9 ( 5% ) falls in blue star - space .",
    "the primary remaining uncertainty is the fraction of misclassified objects in star / cluster space , either objects with measured @xmath75 which are blends of stars , or objects with @xmath46 which are very compact star clusters .",
    "we address these issues in section  3.2 , and find there that any contamination in star / cluster space is at the @xmath76% level .",
    "we conclude therefore , that size measurements provide a relatively robust means of separating compact star clusters from individual stars in this dataset .",
    "this result is somewhat different from what we found in the more distant ( @xmath77  mpc ) antennae galaxies , where using color as an additional critierion was more important for studying clusters fainter than @xmath78 than it is here ( see whitmore 2010 ) .",
    "below , we build catalogs of star clusters selected in two different ways , automatically ( using parameters measured from daophot , _ ishape _ , and sextractor ) and manually .",
    "the manual catalog provides an important consistency check on the automatic catalogs , and helps to quantify contamination from blends , individual stars in crowded regions , and background galaxies ( the latter are negligible here ) .",
    "we determine systematic uncertainties in cluster selection by comparing the results from these catalogs .      as outlined in  3.1.1 , our primary discriminant for separating individual stars and clusters is the concentration index ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "a close inspection of candidate clusters selected based on size ( @xmath79 ) alone from our daophot generated source list shows that there are a number of remaining contaminants , mostly due to close pairs of individual stars , in the most crowded regions . in many cases the overlapping profiles appear to cause the @xmath39 values to be artificially high , resulting in a large number of `` apparent '' clusters in a small area around the more populated clusters ( e.g. ,",
    "the bottom left of figure  [ fig : triangle_region ] ) .",
    "the colors of many of these sources , however , indicates that they are individual stars .",
    "we remove most of these cases by selecting the brightest object with @xmath79 in the region and then removing any similar sources within 20 pixels . while this occasionally removes another cluster nearby ,",
    "the vast majority of the removed objects are clearly close pairs of stars .",
    "we can estimate the number of real clusters removed by this procedure by reinserting objects with @xmath80 , i.e. definite star clusters , since essentially all individual stars in nearby galaxies are fainter than this value ( e.g. , humphreys & davidson 1979 ) .",
    "we find that no clusters were removed by this procedure in the non - nuclear region , while in the nuclear region approximately 20 clusters were removed due to the extreme crowding .",
    "these luminous clusters in the nuclear region are included in the catalog .",
    "the last remaining contaminant , even in relatively isolated regions , is from close pairs of stars of unequal brightness , where the fainter of the pair is measured to have @xmath75 .",
    "we reject most of these remaining contaminants by removing sources having brighter companions within 8 pixels .",
    "the final catalog , which we refer to as our `` daophot '' catalog , contains a total of 1247 cluster candidates brighter than @xmath81 ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) .",
    "approximately 200 of these cluster candidates , mostly brighter than @xmath83 , are in the crowded nuclear region , while the remaining candidates are found outside of the nuclear region .",
    "we consider the daophot catalog to be our best cluster catalog , because a visual inspection shows that , overall , it is missing the fewest number of obvious clusters in both the nuclear and non - nuclear regions , and has the fewest number of false clusters such as from close pairs of stars .",
    "based on artificial cluster experiments , we find that the completeness of clusters in the nuclear region drops quickly for magnitudes fainter than @xmath84 , more than a magnitude brighter than for the non - nuclear region .",
    "this is corroborated by the fact that the luminosity distributions for the clusters begin to flatten below these magnitudes .",
    "size measurements can also be made using the _ ishape _ software ( larsen 1999 ) , as described in section  3.1.1 .",
    "we measured the size of all @xmath85 sources in our daophot catalog using _ ishape _ , and selected cluster candidates to have _ fwhm _ measurements between 0.5 and 10 pixels ( i.e. , at least 0.5  pixels broader than the point spread function ) and a s / n of at least 50 .",
    "we then applied the same neighbor criteria as used for the @xmath39-selected cluster catalog , to eliminate remaining contaminants .",
    "we find overlap between the @xmath39 and _ ishape _ selected catalogs to be @xmath9% , but that _ ishape _ can fail to fit good clusters in more crowded regions , such as within star forming complexes along the spiral arms and in the nuclear region .",
    "the final catalog prepared by this approach , which we refer to as our _ ishape _ catalog , contains a total of 1130 cluster candidates brighter than @xmath86 .",
    "approximately 180 of these candidates , mostly brighter than @xmath87 , are in the crowded nuclear region .",
    "the sextractor software ( bertins & arnouts 1996 ) is also sometimes used to select star cluster candidates .",
    "we produced an independent source list using sextractor , and selected cluster candidates to have @xmath88  pix ( this _ fwhm _ is not deconvolved from the psf , as is done with _ ishape _ ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : man_auto ] shows a comparison between the sextractor- and daophot - based cluster catalogs ( and the manual catalog that will be discussed in section  3.2.4 ) for a small , relatively uncrowded region of our field .",
    "we find that 36 of the 47 objects in our sextractor catalog match objects in the daophot catalog in this region ( i.e. , 77 % ) .",
    "sextractor does a better job than daophot of identifying star clusters as single objects rather than as multiple point sources , but tends to miss some of the more diffuse objects ( e.g. , two objects in the bottom left of figure  [ fig : man_auto ] ) , and also misses most of the very bright clusters in regions with high background , particularly in the nuclear region .",
    "we find that @xmath89% of all 901 objects brighter than @xmath90 and outside of the nuclear region in our sextractor catalog match those in the daophot catalog .    the final catalog prepared by this approach , which we refer to as our `` sextractor '' catalog , contains a total of 1198 cluster candidates brighter than @xmath81 . approximately 200 of these cluster candidates , mostly brighter than @xmath83 but extending to fainter magnitudes than in the daophot catalog , are in the crowded nuclear region .",
    "in addition to the various automatically selected catalogs , we also construct a catalog of clusters manually , by carefully examining the wfc3 images .",
    "this allows more difficult cases , such as a compact cluster near a bright star , to be assessed individually , which is not possible with automatically selected samples .",
    "we also found that this approach has the advantage of minimizing contamination by individual stars in crowded regions , at the expense of missing actual clusters in these regions .",
    "the primary shortcoming to this approach is that it is not possible to automatically reproduce the cluster selection or to quantitatively determine the completeness of the sample .",
    "three of us ( rc , hk , ck ) selected clusters independently across the entire image , using slightly different approachs , but not pushing as deep as the automatic catalogs .",
    "our final , manually selected catalog contains 489 star clusters , mostly brighter than @xmath91 .",
    "figure  [ fig : man_auto ] shows relatively good agreement between the manual and both the daophot ( 21/27 ) and sextractor ( 22/27 ) catalogs ( i.e. , @xmath1780% ) for clusters brighter than @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) as mentioned in the previous section , similar to the @xmath89% agreement found between the full catalogs outside of the nuclear region .",
    "the automatic catalogs are deeper , however , and contain more than double the number of cluster candidates than the manual catalog .",
    "a careful inspection of the sources that are discrepant between the daophot and manual catalogs ( @xmath77% of the total ) indicates that approximately half of these appear to be good clusters in crowded regions , while the other half are mainly remaining blends or superpositions of two close stars .",
    "this suggests that our automatic catalogs have contamination at the @xmath76% level .",

    "two different binnings are shown in each panel , variable size bins with equal numbers of clusters in each bin ( as recommended by maiz apellaniz & ubeda 2005 and shown with filled circles ) and approximately equal size bins with variable numbers of clusters in each bin ( open circles ) .",
    "variable binning will be our preferred method throughout this paper , and will be discussed in more detail in section  4.2 .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : lf_object_selection ] also shows the luminosity function ( in f555w ) for clusters in the nuclear starburst region ( filled triangles ) .",
    "each of these luminosity functions can be described , to first order , by a single power law , @xmath94 .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath4 is given in each panel for the variable size bins .",

    "these values for @xmath4 are compiled in table  [ tab : alpha ] , and discussed further in  4.2 .",
    "we find a power - law index for the luminosity function of clusters in m83 to be @xmath2 .",
    "this is the mean and standard deviation of all @xmath4 values listed in table  [ tab : alpha ] ( excluding the nuclear dataset at the end of the table ) .",
    "the luminosity function of clusters in the nuclear region have a best fit value of @xmath96 , which is the same as that found for clusters outside of the nuclear region , within the errors .      here",
    ", we quantify the sensitivity of the luminosity function of clusters in m83 to different selection techniques , assumptions , and corrections that are typically made in the course of the analysis .",
    "the following items are arranged in the order in which they affect the power - law index @xmath4 .",
    "we note that this order may be different for other datasets with different characteristics , such as lower photometric accuracy or higher extinction than found in our wfc3 m83 data .    *",
    "_ red vs.  blue clusters : _ the luminosity functions of clusters selected by color , i.e. , for red ( @xmath97 ; generally older ) and blue ( @xmath98 ; young ) has the strongest impact on the power law exponent of the luminosity function in our study , with an rms  @xmath99 .",
    "while two of the catalogs ( sextractor and manual ) have values of @xmath4 for the red and blue samples which are within the uncertainties , the other two ( daophot and ishape ) show differences of @xmath100 , with the blue sample having slightly shallower values for @xmath4 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "this result however , does not account for any extinction in m83 .",
    "when we correct the luminosity of each cluster by the extinction derived from our dating analysis ( described in section  5.1 ) , the resulting values of @xmath4 are the same for the red and blue subsamples within the uncertainties .",
    "* _ filter ( i.e. , wavelength ) : _ the choice of filter has a relatively minor effect on values of @xmath4 , with an rms@xmath101 between the four filters of each cluster catalog . while there appears to be a weak trend for the shorter wavelengths to have flatter values of @xmath4 , the values for the f336w and f814w filters are within the formal uncertainties . * _ cluster selection : _ the particular method used to select clusters ( e.g. , manual or automatic , based on different measurements of object size from different software ) for this particular data set does not appear to have a significant impact on the shape of the luminosity function .",
    "the average value of @xmath4 for the four catalogs in the f555w filter , as listed in table  1 , has an rms @xmath102 .",
    "all have the same value of @xmath4 within the uncertainties . *",
    "_ constant vs.  variable binning : _ it has been suggested by maiz apellaniz & ubeda ( 2005 ) that using constant instead of variable size bins can cause variations as large as 0.3 in @xmath4 for small datasets , with values for constant binning being too steep . here",
    "we find a much smaller effect , with @xmath4 typically steeper by only @xmath103 for constant binning when compared with variable binning .",
    "this indicates that the specific choice of binning has little effect on the shape of our luminosity functions .",
    "* _ mean vs.  size - dependent aperture corrections : _ while the difference between assuming mean and size - dependent aperture corrections can result in large variations in the total magnitude for a given cluster , the overall affect on @xmath4 is quite small .",
    "we find an rms @xmath104 between the values of @xmath4 when the mean vs.  size - dependent aperture corrections are used .",
    "to summarize , we find that a variety of effects , including color , filter , selection technique , and binning , can all impact the power - law index @xmath4 of the luminosity function . however , we find that each of these has a small affect , at less than the @xmath99 level .",
    "this is almost certainly a lower limit to the uncertainty on @xmath4 in most extragalactic studies of star forming galaxies , since most observations acquired to date are not as high quality as those presented here , and because the separation of clusters from stars and background galaxies becomes more difficult in more distant galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the luminosity function of star clusters in m83 has relatively small uncertainties , and can be described by a power law with @xmath105 for @xmath106  mag ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the mass and age distributions for a population of star clusters provide the primary window into the formation and disruption of the clusters .",
    "we estimate the age , extinction , and mass of each cluster as we have done in previous works ( see fall et  al .",
    "2005 and whitmore et  al .",
    "2010 for details ) , by performing a least @xmath108 fit comparing measurements in five filters ( _ ubvi_,h@xmath4 ) with new charlot & bruzual models ( cb09 ) using the wfc3 filter transmission curves with solar and @xmath172@xmath18solar metallicity .",
    "we assume a chabrier ( 2003 ) initial stellar mass function ( imf ) , and a galactic extinction law ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "the mass of each cluster is estimated from the observed , extinction corrected @xmath28 band magnitude and the mass - to - light ratio predicted by the models , assuming a distance modulus @xmath109 to m83 .",
    "if we had adopted the salpeter ( 1955 ) rather than the chabrier imf , the @xmath110 and hence the masses would increase by a near constant ( age - independent ) @xmath111% .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mt ] we show the mass - age ( @xmath10-@xmath11 ) diagram of star clusters in m83 that results from the dating analysis of our daophot catalog , assuming @xmath112solar ( upper panel ) and solar metallicity ( lower panel ) .",
    "we find ages for the clusters that span the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "the extinction values in m83 are fairly low , with a typical value of @xmath113 for @xmath45  yr clusters located outside the nuclear regions , and @xmath114 for clusters inside the nuclear starburst region .",
    "the @xmath10-@xmath11 diagrams show a number of small - scale features , with pile - ups at specific ages and gaps at others .",
    "the gap between @xmath115  yr in the upper panel , for example , occurs where the predicted colors loop back on themselves , covering a small region in color space over a relatively long time , and effectively resulting in a gap .",
    "the broad distribution of cluster masses and ages , however , is not greatly affected by these small - scale features , or by the adopted metallicity .",
    "we adopt the masses and ages resulting from our comparison with the @xmath112solar metallicity model in the rest of this paper , because this model gives a somewhat better match to our observed colors for the clusters in m83 .",
    "trends in the distribution of cluster masses and ages are apparent from the @xmath10-@xmath11 diagram . when we look along the horizontal axis , we see that the number of clusters is approximately constant in equal bins of @xmath116 , within a given range of @xmath117 , without increasing or decreasing significantly with age .",
    "this indicates that the cluster age distribution can be described approximately by a power law , @xmath5 , with @xmath118 .",
    "when we look down the vertical axis , we see that the number of clusters increases steadily with decreasing mass .",
    "this indicates that the cluster mass function can be described approximately by a power law , @xmath12 , with @xmath32 much steeper than @xmath119 .",
    "we give a more quantitative treatment in the next two subsections .      in figure",
    "[ fig : dndt ] we show preliminary age distributions for clusters in two different intervals of mass , based on an assumed metallicity of @xmath112solar .",
    "a more detailed treatment based on the full set of filters , in particular the addition of f225w , will be included in chandar  ( in preparation ) .",
    "these distributions decline steeply , and have nearly identical fits , with @xmath120 .",

    "the @xmath122 values determined from the different catalogs and different mass ranges are all within @xmath123 of those shown in figure  [ fig : dndt ] .",
    "based on these experiments , we conclude that the exponent for the age distribution of clusters is approximately @xmath124 .",
    "this result , that the age distribution declines steeply for clusters more massive than a @xmath125 and younger than a few@xmath126  yr , is quite similar to those found recently by mora et  al .",

    "they determined the age distribution by counting the number of clusters brighter than a given @xmath28 band luminosity in different bins of @xmath116 , and found them to be consistent with a value of @xmath128 after converting their luminosity - limited result to a mass - limited one .",
    "by contrast , gieles & bastian ( 2008 ) claim a flat age distribution with @xmath129 from the mora et  al .  sample . their result is based on an indirect technique that plots the mass of the most massive cluster as a function of age in the form @xmath130 vs.@xmath131 , and uses the resulting slope to infer the shape of the age distribution , assuming a constant shape for the mass function over time ( see chandar et  al .",
    "2010a for more details ) .",
    "the gieles & bastian result is dominated by a single data point , the youngest one , where they find a maximum mass of only @xmath132 for clusters younger than @xmath133  yr .",
    "yr , they also find several clusters more massive than @xmath134 .",
    "] however , our observations of m83 clearly reveal a large number of clusters more massive than @xmath135 that formed in the last @xmath133  yr .",
    "the declining shape , with @xmath118 , found for the age distribution of young star clusters in m83 is similar to that found in over a dozen other galaxies for @xmath136  yr , including dwarf and massive galaxies , spirals and irregular galaxies , interacting and isolated galaxies .",
    "as summarized in chandar et  al .",
    "2010a , virtually all of the star - forming galaxies studied to date have age distributions with similar declining shapes , with @xmath122 values between @xmath137 and @xmath138 for mass - limited samples , or have @xmath10-@xmath11 diagrams that have approximately equal numbers of clusters in equal bins of @xmath116 , above a given mass .",
    "these similarities in over a dozen different galaxies suggests that it is the disruption rather than the formation of the clusters that is primarily responsible for shaping the age distribution .",
    "it is much more likely that clusters in all of these galaxies have had similar disruption histories than it is that they have had similar formation histories , and that we just happen to be observing them all at exactly the time when their formation rates have peaked .",
    "several different processes may disrupt clusters on relatively short timescales @xmath139  yr , while preserving the shape of the mass function ( see fall et  al .",
    "2009 ; 2010 , chandar et  al .",
    "2010b ) .      in figure",
    "[ fig : mf ] , we present preliminary mass functions for star clusters in m83 in three different intervals of age : @xmath1407 , @xmath1418 , and @xmath1428.6 , based on our dating analysis .",
    "the mass functions , like the luminosity functions , can be described by a power law , @xmath12 .",
    "the best fit values of @xmath32 for the different age ranges are given in figure  [ fig : mf ] , and are the same within the uncertainties as those found for the luminosity function , with @xmath143 .",
    "like the luminosity functions , the mass functions show no obvious deviation from a power law , such as a bend at either the high or low mass end . in a future paper",
    "we will present a more detailed treatment based on the full set of filters , in particular the addition of the f225w filter , and based on different age - dating methods and a wider variety of stellar population models .",
    "we will also include clusters found in a second pointing in m83 .",
    "we find a power - law index for the mass function of clusters in m83 to be @xmath144 , for @xmath7 and @xmath145  yr .",
    "this is the mean and standard deviation of all @xmath32 values shown in figure  [ fig : mf ] .",
    "we find similar results for the three other cluster catalogs described in section  3.2 .",
    "the power - law index for the lf ( @xmath4 ) and for the mass function ( @xmath32 ) are the same within their uncertainties , with @xmath2 and @xmath146 . while the luminosity and mass functions are sometimes considered to be interchangeable , this is not true for populations of clusters that include a wide range of ages , and hence mass - to - light ratios .",
    "in fact , the observed similarity in the values of @xmath4 and @xmath32 , which are both power laws , is ( indirect ) evidence that the age and mass distributions are independent of one another , at least for @xmath147  yr ( see for e.g. , fall 2006 ) .",
    "in this section we use the observed shape of the mass function of @xmath1488.6  yr clusters to investigate two issues related to the formation and evolution of the clusters .",
    "first , we assess whether or not there is evidence for an upper cutoff to the masses with which clusters in m83 can form .",
    "curvature at the high end of the mass function would provide evidence for such a physical limit .",
    "second , we determine whether there is evidence for the early disruption of lower mass clusters when compared with their higher mass counterparts . curvature or",
    "a flattening at the low end of the mass function would provide evidence for the mass - dependent disruption of the clusters .",
    "several recent papers have suggested that there is a cutoff at the high end of the mass function of relatively young ( @xmath149  yr ) clusters in some spiral galaxies , such as m51 , m83 , & ngc  6946 ( e.g. , gieles et  al .",
    "2006 ; larsen 2009 ) .",
    "more recently , portegies zwart et  al .  ( 2010 ) suggested that a cutoff @xmath150 may be present in _ all _ milky way - like spiral galaxies .",
    "a cutoff can typically be described by a schechter function , @xmath151 ( e.g. , burkert & smith 2000 ; fall & zhang 2001 ; jordan et  al .",
    "2007 ) , where the number of massive clusters drops exponentially compared with the number of lower mass clusters , i.e. , faster than a power law .",
    "for example , schechter functions with @xmath152 provide significantly better fits than power laws at the high end of the mass function of old globular clusters ( e.g. , burkert & smith 2000 ; fall & zhang 2001 ; jordan et  al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we found in section  5.3 and in figure  [ fig : mf ] that a power law provides a good fit to the mass function of clusters in m83 at different ages .",
    "a k - s test comparing the masses of clusters with @xmath153 with a power law of @xmath154 returns a @xmath155-value of 0.32 , i.e. , a power law provides an acceptable fit to the upper end of the cluster mass function ( note : a @xmath155-value @xmath156 is typically indicative of an unacceptable fit ) .",
    "the upper panel of figure  13 compares the observed mass function with three different values of @xmath14 : @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "this figure suggests that values of @xmath14 that are lower than @xmath160 do not provide a good match to the data . this visual impression is confirmed by statistical tests .",
    "we are only able to place a lower - limit on @xmath14 , with all values @xmath161 giving acceptable fits , i.e. , within a 95% confidence level , based on formal k - s tests .",
    "we conclude that , because a power law provides an acceptable fit , our data do not require a schechter function to describe them .",
    "next , we use the shape of the mass function to study the dynamical evolution of the clusters . some processes that disrupt clusters , such as the loss of stars due to ( internal ) two - body relaxation ,",
    "will disrupt lower mass clusters earlier than higher mass clusters ( at a constant density ) .",
    "two - body relaxation causes clusters to lose mass at an approximately linear rate ( e.g. , fall & zhang 2001 ; see mclauglin & fall 2008 for a detailed discussion of evaporation rates ) , giving a disruption time that depends on the initial mass @xmath162 of the cluster as @xmath163 , with @xmath164 . here",
    ", @xmath165 is the characteristic time it takes to disrupt a @xmath166 cluster . in figure",
    "[ fig : mfmodels ] ( lower panel ) we compare the mass function for log  @xmath167  yr clusters for different values of @xmath165 : @xmath168  yr , @xmath169  yr , and @xmath170  yr . because the mass function follows a power - law without flattening at lower masses , we can only place a lower limit on @xmath165 , and find @xmath171  yr .",
    "this result does not mean that cluster disruption does not take place until after @xmath172  yr , only that the disruption of clusters on shorter timescales does not depend strongly on the mass of the clusters .",
    "the results presented here indicate that the cluster age distribution is approximately independent of mass , and that the cluster mass function is approximately independent of age .",
    "this means that the bivariate distribution of cluster masses and ages , @xmath173 , can be written as the product of the mass and age distributions : @xmath174 , with @xmath13 and @xmath124 .",
    "this result for m83 is similar to those found for the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , parmentier & de grijs 2008 ; chandar et  al .",
    "2010b ) and for the antennae ( fall et  al .",
    "2009 ) , and indicates that mass - dependent disruption plays little role , but that mass-_in_dependent disruption plays a strong role , in shaping the masses and ages of clusters in these galaxies for the first @xmath136  yr .",

    ", we used several different methods to select compact star clusters , and assessed the impact that various assumptions and corrections have on the shape of the luminosity function .",
    "we found that the luminosity function of star clusters in m83 can be described by a power law , @xmath94 , with @xmath105 .",
    "we found that the selection of the clusters , i.e. , the specific criteria that are used to find and catalog them , does not have a significant impact on @xmath4 , with variations on the order of @xmath175 .",
    "other issues that impact @xmath4 , roughly in order of importance are : object color ( @xmath176 ) , filter ( @xmath177 ) , binning ( @xmath178 ) , and aperture corrections ( @xmath179 ) .",

    "the age distribution declines steeply , @xmath5 , with @xmath180 , for clusters more massive than @xmath181 and ages younger than @xmath182  yr , and has the same shape for different masses .",
    "these results were interpreted to mean that @xmath990% of clusters are disrupted every decade in age , in a manner that does not strongly depend on their mass .",
    "we found that the mass function can be described by a power law , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , for clusters with @xmath183 and @xmath145  yr .",
