    "some of the most prominent emission lines in t tauri stars are from hydrogen . in the first few decades of t tauri research",
    "the balmer emission lines were attributed to formation in energetic winds @xcite , but in the mid - nineties a reassessment of the hydrogen emission line profile morphology in the context of magnetospheric infall @xcite became the underpinning for the current paradigm that these young stars are in the final stages of accretion from a protoplanetary disk .",
    "early successes of the model included generating balmer emission line profiles that are centrally peaked and have a small blue asymmetry , with inverse p cygni profiles at favorable inclinations @xcite .",
    "a series of papers culminating in @xcite carried out a grid of radiative transfer models for line formation under the assumption of magnetospheric accretion in a dipole field geometry , finding good agreement in general profile morphology and line luminosity for hydrogen lines in many stars , including the infrared lines pa@xmath3 and br@xmath4 .",
    "these models have more recently been incorporated into composite accretion and disk wind scenarios @xcite and into time dependent 3-d numerical simulations of magnetospheric accretion , including both dipole and multipole configurations , which may be aligned or misaligned with the stellar rotation axis @xcite , and accompanied by mhd winds from the inner disk @xcite . in general the magnetospheric accretion models",
    "do a reasonable job of describing the morphology of the hydrogen line profiles and their luminosities , and are widely accepted as the origin of hydrogen emission in classical t tauri ( ctts ) stars .",
    "however , shortcomings of these models have been identified by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , based on comparing predictions and observations of line profile morphology , especially in the larger extent of the blue wing emission in observed compared to model profiles .",
    "regardless of their origin , several groups have found well defined relations between the hydrogen line luminosity and the disk accretion rate , where the latter is assessed from accretion shock models of the excess optical and ultraviolet emission attributed to the post - shock heated photosphere at the magnetospheric footprints , that also includes contributions from the pre - shock gas @xcite .",
    "this empirical correlation between hydrogen line luminosity and disk accretion rate , first established for pa@xmath3 and br@xmath4 by @xcite , has become a powerful means of determining disk accretion rates for ysos over a wide range of masses included embedded objects , where high extinction prevents optical and ultraviolet emission excess above the photosphere from being observed and modeled @xcite .",
    "improved understanding of hydrogen emission in accreting stars will require a confrontation between the physical conditions required to produce the line luminosities and line ratios in combination with high resolution profile studies that define the kinematics of the line formation region .",
    "to date , the hydrogen line luminosities in the magnetospheric accretion models are treated in an ad - hoc way , where accretion rates through the funnel flow set the density of infalling gas , and line luminosities require fine - tuning the temperature and size of the flow , with larger sizes and cooler temperatures in the higher accretion rate , higher line luminosity sources .",
    "required temperatures range from lows of 6000 ",
    "7000  k for high accretion rate sources to 10,000  20,000 k for low accretion rate sources @xcite .",
    "attempts to self consistently assess heating and cooling in funnel flows are more restrictive in allowed temperatures @xcite and the inferred low temperatures can not account for the observed hydrogen line luminosities @xcite . however , this ad - hoc approach to determining the temperature in a funnel flow does result in a relation between line luminosity and accretion rate similar to what is observed by assessing accretion rates from excess continuum emission , providing an overall consistency with this interpretation of the hydrogen emission .",
    "a more direct approach for assessing the physical conditions in the hydrogen line formation region is to use observed line luminosities and line ratios as direct diagnostics of the density and temperature based on calculations of atomic level populations .",
    "natta , giovanardi , and palla took this approach in their 1988 paper , exploring the ionization and excitation structure of hydrogen lines formed in dense , cool winds from low luminosity pre - main sequence stars , with mass loss rates between @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7  yr@xmath8 .",
    "they found that line luminosities increase with mass loss rate , although different assumptions for the gas temperature and stellar radiation field produced a wide range of fluxes at a given mass loss rate .",
    "they also pointed out that line ratios in the infrared may be able to discriminate among different models .",
    "the advantage of using near infrared hydrogen lines as diagnostics of physical conditions is significant .",
    "the line opacities are much smaller than the balmer lines , so they rarely show blueshifted absorption from a wind and have a lower frequency of redshifted absorption from infalling gas @xcite and extinction corrections are also smaller .",
    "historically , the most widely examined ratio in near infrared lines is pa@xmath3@xmath9br@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite found this ratio , coupled with the line luminosities , to be roughly consistent with the magnetospheric models described above for 19 ctts in tau - aur . in the magnetospheric accretion scenario",
    "both lines are optically thick and pa@xmath3@xmath9br@xmath4 ratios are between 3 and 6 .",
    "a study of ctts and brown dwarfs in @xmath10 oph found most of the ctts to have similar ratios to tau - aur but the accreting brown dwarfs and a few ctts showed pa@xmath3@xmath9br@xmath4 ratios @xmath11 2 , which were posited to result from low temperature , high optical depths spots in the shock heated photosphere @xcite .",
    "a recent investigation of this ratio in 47 sources in the chameleon i and ii star formation region @xcite found that while many have ratios similar to those in tau - aur , almost half have ratios @xmath12 2 , again posited to form in very optically thick regions with @xmath13 k.    a growing number of near infrared spectrographs permit a broad range of ratios from paschen and brackett series decrements to be determined simultaneously , which is crucial since the lines are quite variable .",
    "a number of recent studies have compared these decrements to predictions of baker and menzel s case b for radiative ionization and recombination , which are available in an online database @xcite . in this recombination scenario",
    "the near infrared lines are optically thin , the level populations are dominated by radiative cascade from the continuum , and collisional effects are included .",
    "this approach has yielded some surprising results . in a study of 15 stars from tau - aur , @xcite found paschen and brackett decrements , taken as an average over all stars , to be best matched by case b conditions with @xmath14 k and",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16  @xmath2 .",
    "similar approaches for other individual stars indicate quite different conditions . for tw hya",
    ", @xcite find series decrements matching case b for @xmath17 20,000 k and @xmath15 @xmath18 @xmath2 , while @xcite found reasonable agreement for case b predictions of @xmath17 10,000  k and @xmath15 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath2 from the brackett decrement for ru lup .",
    "similar approaches have been taken for other ysos , where @xcite find decrements implying @xmath17 10,000 k and @xmath15",
    "@xmath21 @xmath2 for the outbursting ctts ex lup and @xcite find @xmath22 10,000 k and @xmath15 = @xmath23 @xmath2 for the aebe star v921 sco .",
    "this very diverse range of physical conditions inferred from comparing case b predictions to series decrements , with a range of over 6 orders of magnitude in density and temperatures from 1000 to 20,000  k , makes it questionable as to whether this scenario may be an appropriate choice for evaluating the physical conditions in the hydrogen line formation region in accreting young stars .    spectacular new instrumentation , such as the vlt s x - shooter and crires ,",
    "ensure that abundant near infrared spectra of star forming regions will be forthcoming and it is thus of interest to identify good diagnostics for interpreting these results .",
    "a new set of local line excitation calculations by @xcite for physical conditions appropriate for winds and accretion flows in ctts offers an opportunity to evaluate hydrogen line ratios in series decrements and across series without the restrictions imposed by case b assumptions and over a wider range of physical conditions and atomic properties than in the earlier work of @xcite .",
    "since these calculations , which evaluate line emissivities as a function of density , temperature , and ionizing flux , also include transitions of , , and , they offer the opportunity to evaluate physical conditions from many emission line ratios simultaneously , presenting more rigorous tests of the line formation region than previously available .",
    "in this paper we look at various diagnostics from the paschen and brackett series for 16 t tauri stars and compare them to predictions for both case b and the kwan & fischer local line excitation models . the sample overlaps with those of @xcite and @xcite but the lines are resolved , allowing us to specify velocity limits in the paschen and brackett lines of each star that are not affected by redshifted absorption features , thus giving more precise line ratios of the emitting gas than lower resolution studies and also to make good assessments of the continuum emission excess .",
    "the presentation includes ",
    "2 describing the sample and uncertainties in extinction , ",
    "3 presenting the observed hydrogen line ratios and introducing several diagnostics to compare to model predictions , ",
    "4 comparing the assumptions for case b and the kwan & fischer local line excitation calculations , and   5 comparing model predictions to observations and examining the role of extinction uncertainties .",
    "we end with a discussion and conclusions in   6 and ",
    "our sample is 16 classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) observed with spex at the infrared telescope facility on 2006 november 26 and 27 .",
    "it is largely drawn from the tau - aur star forming region , with spectral types from g8 to m2 , and selected to cover a broad range of emission excess and disk accretion rates .",
    "the spectra were taken in the short - wavelength cross - dispersed ( sxd ) mode , with an 0.3@xmath24 by 15@xmath24 slit and a spectral extent from 0.8 to 2.4  @xmath25 m at a resolving power @xmath26 .",
    "total exposure times ranged from 16 to 48 minutes for the program stars , with @xmath27 , yielding a continuum @xmath28 at @xmath29 , increasing to longer wavelengths .",
    "the only unresolved binary in the sample is df tau , separation of 0.09 , of spectral types m2.0 and m2.5 with a flux ratio at @xmath30 of 1.62 @xcite .",
    "these spectra were included in the study of fischer et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , hereafter @xcite , and further properties of the sample are detailed there , along with specifics of the reduction and analysis of the spectra .    in the 2011 paper",
    "these spectra were used in conjunction with near simultaneous spectra from keck i s hires and keck ii s nirspec to derive continuum veiling and continuum emission excesses from 0.48 to 2.4  @xmath31 . here",
    "we focus on the near infrared hydrogen emission lines in the spex spectra , which were shown by @xcite to have equivalent widths proportional to the excess continuum emission . as in previous studies ,",
    "the _ veiling _ is defined as the ratio of excess to photospheric emission at a specific wavelength .",
    "table  [ t.sample ] identifies the sample , along with the literature spectral types used in fehk , the veiling at 1 @xmath25 m , @xmath32 , derived in fehk , and the emission equivalent widths for pa@xmath3 , pa@xmath4 , and br@xmath4 measured from the spex spectra .",
    "the 1 @xmath25 m veiling ranges from just barely detectable ( 0.1 ) to quite significant ( 3.4 ) and the equivalent widths range from lows of a few tenths of an   to as high as 28    for pa@xmath3 and 10   for br@xmath4 .",
    "the error in equivalent width depends on the signal to noise in the continuum , the line to continuum ratio , and the width of the line ( several hundred km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "most stars have equivalent width errors @xmath33% but for the three stars ( aa tau , bm and , lkca 8) with the smallest line / continuum ratios ( 1.02 to 1.05 at br@xmath4 ) errors can exceed 50% .",

[ f.acc ] ]    our spex spectra were not calibrated on an absolute scale , but the shape of the continuum is well defined by the relative fluxes and we used the spex continuum flux adjacent to each line plus an estimate for extinction to restore equivalent width ratios to the line intensity ratios that are the basis for comparing to models .",
    "the extinction is a much larger source of uncertainty .",
    "table  [ t.av ] illustrates the magnitude of this problem .",
    "the @xmath34 in column 2 is from @xcite , found from fitting the observed spectral energy distribution from 0.8 to 2.4  @xmath31 with a combination of a main sequence spectral template with zero reddening plus a continuum excess anchored by simultaneously measured line veilings of photospheric features .",
    "this technique , following the approach taken in @xcite for optical spectra , is in principle superior to deriving extinction from observed colors , since , as shown in @xcite , most t tauri stars have excess emission at all wavelengths , invalidating the standard technique of deriving @xmath34 from colors . however , as shown in @xcite , when applied in the near infrared , this technique yields @xmath34 that are often larger than those derived from optical studies , due at least in part to the use of main sequence spectral templates and the possible presence of large cool spots .",
    "thus we also list in table  [ t.av ] the minimum and maximum @xmath34 collected from the literature , the mean of these values ( including fehk ) , and a new estimate of @xmath34 that we will derive in this paper in section 5.3 , based on comparing observed line ratios to the local line excitation models of @xcite .",
    "the sources for the literature values of @xmath34 are cited in the notes to table  [ t.av ] .",
    "we use the extinction law of @xcite with @xmath35 , as represented in the routine _ fm_unred.pro _ in the idl astronomy library , to convert between extinctions at different wavelengths .",
    "also listed in table  [ t.av ] are the accretion luminosities and mass accretion rates derived from the luminosity of pa@xmath3 .",
    "the pa@xmath3 luminosities are derived from the line equivalent width , the absolute flux in the adjacent continuum , the extinction and the distance .",
    "since we did not have absolute flux calibrated spectra we adopted continuum fluxes from the 2mass @xmath29 magnitudes and used distances of 140 pc , 200 pc and 440 pc for tau - aur @xcite , as 353a @xcite and bm and @xcite respectively . the accretion luminosity and mass accretion rates were calculated from pa@xmath3 luminosities following the calibration of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "mass accretion rates also required estimates of the stellar mass and radii , made from application of the @xcite tracks to the effective temperatures and stellar luminosities from @xcite . for extinctions we used the mean value of @xmath34 identified in table  [ t.av ] .",
    "both accretion luminosity and mass accretion rate are plotted in figure  [ f.acc ] against the simultaneously observed 1 @xmath25 m veiling , @xmath32 .",
    "the symbols correspond to the values derived with the mean @xmath34 while the vertical lines extending below / above each symbol correspond to values derived from the minimum / maximum values of @xmath34 from the literature cited in table  [ t.av ] .",
    "the figure illustrates that even with the large spread in reported @xmath34 , @xmath32 is a reasonable proxy for accretion luminosity and disk accretion rate , where the accretion luminosities for our sample range from 1.5  @xmath36  to @xmath37 @xmath36  and the disk accretion rates from @xmath38 to @xmath39 @xmath7  yr@xmath8 .",
    "we will adopt the @xmath34 from fehk in calculating emission intensity ratios since it is determined in the same way for all stars in our sample .",
    "a difference of 1 magnitude in @xmath34 affects the ratios pa@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 and br@xmath40@xmath9br@xmath4 by a factor of 7% , br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 by 12% , and pa12@xmath9pa@xmath3 by 19% .",
    "there is no correlation between line ratios and @xmath34 , indicating there is not a systematic effect on the ratios from the adopted extinction .",
    "an examination of the effect of extinction in the comparison of observed line ratios to those predicted from line excitation models will be the focus of section 5.3 .",
    "in this section we present line intensity ratios for the paschen series pa@xmath3 through pa12 , and for two brackett lines , br@xmath4 and br@xmath40 .",
    "we will compare the 1  @xmath25 m veiling , @xmath32 , to observed line ratios and make use of the fact that the broad paschen and brackett lines are resolved with the modest spex velocity resolution of about 150 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "we calculate intensity ratios for pa@xmath4/pa@xmath3 and for br@xmath4/pa@xmath3 in three different ways for each star in our sample .",
    "one ( ` direct ' ) is the intensity ratio based on the emission equivalent width measured directly from the spex spectra over the full range of the emission .",
    "the other two are measured from _ residual line profiles _ , where the photosphere of an appropriately veiled spectral template is subtracted from the ctts spectrum ( see @xcite for a description of this technique and fehk for the templates used here ) . in one case",
    "the equivalent widths are measured over the full range of the residual emission , and in the other the equivalent widths , and corresponding line ratios , are found over a limited velocity range in the residual line profile .",
    "the line ratios from each of these three techniques are tabulated in table  [ t.intensity ] for each star .",
    "the residual pa@xmath3 , pa@xmath4 , and br@xmath4 profiles ( normalized and superposed ) are shown in figure  [ f.vel ] with stars arranged in order of @xmath32 , from highest to lowest . although the spex resolution of 150 km  s@xmath8 just resolves these broad lines , it is sufficient to show the opacity dependent differences in the redshifted absorption in some stars ( e.g.  cw tau , dk tau , df tau , bm and ) .",
    "we therefore compute the intensity ratios from residual profiles both over the full range of emission ( labeled ` full ' ) and also over velocity intervals selected to be free of opacity effects from the redshifted absorption ( labeled ` select ' ) , in principle giving more reliable ratios when comparing to models .",
    "the velocity intervals are marked in figure  [ f.vel ] with vertical dotted lines and identified in table  [ t.intensity ] .",
    "intensity ratios determined from emission equivalent widths in these velocity intervals are given for pa@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 , br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 and br@xmath40/br@xmath4 in table  [ t.intensity ] and the paschen series through pa12 , relative to pa@xmath3 , in table  [ t.decrement ] .",
    "we omit higher series lines because the lines are weak in most stars and the @xcite calculations used a 15-level h atom , giving reliable fluxes only through pa13 and br13 .",

    "although each line emissivity is for a uniform density and temperature in roughly the middle of an accretion flow / wind , while the observed line flux will be an integration of the emissivity over the entire kinematic structure , kf pointed out that since each position in the flow will be represented by the local line excitation , only with different parameters , that it is possible to judge how the resultant ratios will be affected when averaged over a range of density and/or temperature .",
    "they concluded that observed line flux ratios do indeed indicate clearly enough the physical conditions and that this approximation is reasonable .",
    "the two models have similar ranges in @xmath15 , but refer to quite different physical regimes , arising from the fundamental difference in the energy source for the line photons , which is continuum photons more energetic than 13.6 ev in the recombination model and thermal kinetic energy in the kf model . the derived electron fraction in the kf calculations",
    "is somewhat dependent on the ionization rate , as shown in their figure 5 , but @xmath67 is @xmath68 over a wide range of density for @xmath69 8750 k and @xmath11 0.1 at @xmath70  k. thus although @xmath15 in both the case b and kf models is similar , the line optical depths are vastly different . in kf , at fixed values of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath51 , the run of the calculation with increasing @xmath0 corresponds to increasing line optical depths , producing a corresponding variation of the line emissivities . for example , the ly@xmath55 optical depth for the case of @xmath71 @xmath2 and @xmath22 10,000 k is @xmath72 .",
    "this is much higher than the limit imposed by the recombination model , since in kf collisional excitation from @xmath52 , whose population is sustained by the strong ly@xmath55 trapping , is the predominant cause for the strength of the line emission .",

    "this is illustrated in figure  [ f.theory ] where the relation between increasing @xmath15 for case b or @xmath0 for the kf local line excitation is shown for four ratios :  pa@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 , br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 , pa12@xmath9pa@xmath3 , and br10@xmath9br@xmath4 for a range of temperatures .",

    "in case b , the line ratios have a very small dynamic range for @xmath75 k. in the kf calculations , the line ratios are initially low when the lines are optically thin and then increase steeply as @xmath0 increases , until they plateau at high optical depths .",
    "the range of observed ratios is shown along the left side of each panel .",
    "temperature line types apply to all panels .",

    "( see figures in kf for corresponding optical depths ) .",
    "the rise begins at lower densities for higher temperatures , but the general behavior is similar for temperatures between 5000 and 20,000 k. these relations readily account for the range of observed ratios , where higher ratios are explained by higher densities / optical depths . at the highest density in the kf calculations of @xmath77 @xmath2 ,",
    "the ratios of pa@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 and pa12@xmath9pa@xmath3 exceed unity and are still climbing , while the ratios of br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 and br10@xmath9br@xmath4 have plateaued at peak values around 0.6 and 2 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the case b predictions show quite different behavior . at low @xmath15",
    "all four ratios are higher when @xmath51 is lower .",
    "this is because the radiative recombination rate to level @xmath78 is proportional to @xmath79 , where the index @xmath55 increases from 0.7 to 1.1 as @xmath78 increases from 3 to 12 , so as @xmath51 decreases there is a stronger preference , comparatively , towards radiative recombinations into higher @xmath78 levels .",
    "as @xmath15 increases , three - body recombinations begin to contribute . at a given @xmath51 these recombinations , unlike radiative ones , strongly favor population into higher @xmath78 levels , since the rate to level @xmath78 is proportional to @xmath80 times a factor which itself increases rapidly with increasing @xmath78 .",
    "this rate is also roughly proportional to @xmath81 , so its influence is also stronger when @xmath51 is lower .",
    "hence the dispersion of each depicted line ratio with temperature increases with increasing @xmath15 until collisional de - excitation and collisional ionization begin to dominate over radiative decay and the ratio falls with further @xmath15 increase .",
    "this transition occurs at lower @xmath15 for higher @xmath78 levels because collisional rates are higher while einstein @xmath82 rates are lower for higher @xmath78 .",
    "while it occurs near @xmath83 @xmath2 for pa@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 and br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 , in the case of pa12@xmath9pa@xmath3 it occurs at @xmath84 @xmath2 .",
    "( the density grid in the storey and hummer online server can interpolate ratios only between integer values of log @xmath15 , so whether the peak ratio is precisely at the stated value is unclear ) .",
    "note that the case b relations require temperatures @xmath11 1000 k to account for ratios above the median observed value for each ratio shown , while electron densities @xmath85 @xmath2 are favored for pa@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 and br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 but @xmath15 @xmath41 @xmath86 @xmath2 is required for ratios incorporating the higher levels pa12@xmath9pa@xmath3 and br10@xmath9br@xmath4 .",
    "thus , the differing behaviors of the line ratios with increasing @xmath15 shown in figure  [ f.theory ] result from the fundamentally different nature of the two calculations . in the kf calculations the behavior follows simply from the fact that as @xmath0 increases at a local point with all the other parameters fixed , the line optical depths also increase .",
    "the rise of each ratio with @xmath0 follows from the stronger build - up of population into higher @xmath78 levels via collisions , coupled with the larger optical depth of the lower transition , thus enhancing the emissivity of the line in the numerator and reducing the emission effectiveness of the line in the denominator .    in the recombination model",
    ", there is no explicit determination of @xmath87 , but given that @xmath87@xmath88 ) , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the radiative and three - body recombination coefficient respectively , @xmath91 is the proton density and neglecting , for ease of explanation , the process of collisional ionization from high @xmath78 levels , @xmath87 will , at fixed @xmath57 , increase rapidly as @xmath15 increases , so to maintain the same constraint on @xmath53 in order for recombination to remain dominant over collisional excitation from @xmath78 = 2 as a means of photon production , @xmath57 must increase or @xmath92 must decrease accordingly .",
    "indeed , with collisional rates increasing with increasing @xmath15 while einstein @xmath82 rates remain fixed , the limit on @xmath53 actually needs to vary inversely with @xmath15 , making the required changes in @xmath57 and/or @xmath92 even more drastic .",
    "thus the recombination results actually implicate associated changes in those two parameters which one must also assess for plausibility before applying the case b results to observations .",
    "for example , if the length scale of the emission corresponding to the same velocity gradient used in kf is adopted , the resultant constraint on the ly@xmath55 optical depth of @xmath93 requires @xmath94 @xmath2 for the case b conditions .",
    "then , for @xmath95 5000 k , @xmath96 ( @xmath97 s@xmath8 . for @xmath98 @xmath2 , for example , the photoionization rate from the ground state",
    "must then be orders of magnitude higher than the @xmath57= @xmath63 s@xmath8 considered in the kf calculations .",
    "( the fairly high ionization in kf with @xmath59 of @xmath44 0.6 for @xmath99 k is due to photoionization from excited states by the stellar and veiling continuum . )",
    "the length scale of the emission region can be reduced to alleviate the constraint on @xmath57 , but probably not by more than a factor of 10 .",
    "thus in case b it is the requirement that recombinations continue to predominate at high @xmath15 , demanding a physical regime requiring particularly strong photoionizations to maintain low line optical depths , that is the reason for the depicted behavior of the line ratios with @xmath15 in figure  [ f.theory ] .",
    "these restrictions embedded within the case b assumptions are grounds to doubt their validity in the interpretation of hydrogen line ratios in ctts . to further demonstrate this point , in the next section we compare conclusions of both case b and the kf calculations to hydrogen line ratios .",

    "@xmath9pa@xmath3 versus br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 and lower is pa@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath125 versus br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath125 . in both panels",
    "dotted lines connect ratios from the minimum and maximum reported @xmath34 for each star , where the minimum ( @xmath126 ) is the ratio uncorrected for extinction .",
    "other points correspond to :  @xmath34 from @xcite ( @xmath127 ) , @xmath34 s from the literature ( @xmath128 ) , and the kf @xmath34 ( @xmath129 ) . in both cases ,",
    "extrema of the literature values are outside the range of the model .",
    "both use the same temperature legend , but a wider range of densities is shown in the lower panel . [ f.ext ] ]    even with the uncertainty in @xmath34 some conclusions can be drawn from comparing observed ratios to the kf calculations .",
    "first , the uncertainty in extinction does not alter the empirical conclusion that stars with higher veiling tend to have higher line ratios , since this trend is not affected by reddening vectors . in the kf models , the reddening vectors cross the iso - temperature lines orthogonally so that @xmath0 but not temperature is well constrained , with an implied range in density from @xmath119 to @xmath120 @xmath2 , as noted in the last section . the temperature is impossible to disentangle from the uncertainty in @xmath34 ; however , if we make the assumption that ctts hydrogen lines form in a narrow temperature range then the spread in observed ratios across iso - temperature lines in the ratio - ratio plots could be due wholly to uncertainty in the adopted extinction for each star .    adopting this assumption with the kf predictions",
    "we can recover an @xmath34 that would place each star along a single temperature locus .",
    "while no such temperature assessment exists from first principles , @xmath130 10,000 k is a reasonable choice for both the magnetospheric accretion models of @xcite and @xcite and the wind models of @xcite . we thus calculate a new @xmath34 for each star , indicated by filled triangles in figure  [ f.ext ] and listed in column 6 of table  [ t.av ] , corresponding to the extinction correction required to bring each star to the @xmath22 10,000  k iso - temperature line from the kf models . this ` kf @xmath34 ' is in the mid - range of previously determined values for most stars , and is on average 0.7 magnitudes smaller than the @xmath34 adopted throughout this paper from the fehk study . for tw hya the ` kf @xmath34 ' is zero since it already lies on the @xmath22 10,000  k iso - temperature line .",
    "this is also the extinction that is found in all studies of this nearby star .",
    "this technique can not be applied to cy tau , since the uncorrected ratios lie on the @xmath22 20,000  k iso - temperature line .",
    "thus although we identify ` kf @xmath34 ' = 0 for this star , this is not in line with previous estimates and likely means the uncorrected ratios are in error due to the large uncertainty in the definition of the br@xmath4 profile .",
    "in contrast if the same spread of implied ratios were plotted on the case b ratio - ratio plot of figure 8 the result would be ambiguous in inferring both density and temperature .",
    "the spread of up to 2.5 magnitudes in @xmath34 for each star means that reddening vectors would cross multiple iso - density lines orthogonally , and each iso - temperature surface would also be intersected twice , corresponding to a different implied density in each case . under this scenario , even if one were to adjust the @xmath34 to locate all the stars along the same iso - density line , temperatures from 1000 to 20,000 k would be required to match the observations , and tw hya would be several orders of magnitude higher density than the other stars .",
    "it is difficult to imagine that there is such a variety of physical conditions in the region where hydrogen lines form in ctts , making the kf assumptions seem far more plausible than any case b scenario",
    ".    additional insight on extinction can be gleaned by turning to line ratios that arise from the same upper level , so the effects of density and temperature on the ratio are much reduced . to this end",
    ", we show in the lower panel of figure  [ f.ext ] a ratio - ratio plot of pa@xmath125@xmath9pa@xmath4 versus br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath125 .",
    "the behavior of the kf calculations for this ratio - ratio relationship is different from those shown previously because both br@xmath4 and pa@xmath125 arise from the same upper level ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "this ratio is shown as a function of @xmath0 and temperature in the kf calculations in figure  [ f.pdel ] , analogous to the ratios shown in figure  [ f.theory ] .",
    "however , this ratio behaves quite differently from the other line ratios studied here , which rise continuously as the optical depth increases until reaching a plateau value .",
    "instead , br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath125 departs from the optically thin ratio around @xmath0 = @xmath86 @xmath2 , first rising as pa@xmath125 becomes optically thick , and then falling as the optical depths of both lines continue to increase .",
    "when included in a ratio - ratio plot , such as pa@xmath125@xmath9pa@xmath4 versus br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath125 , the former ratio traces density while the latter is sensitive mostly to extinction , with a dynamic range about half that of the other line ratios over the same span of density and temperature .",
    "@xmath9pa@xmath125 as a function of log @xmath0 .",
    "since both transitions arise from the same @xmath131 upper level , even with a wide range of optical depths , this ratio is much less sensitive to density and has a smaller dynamic range than other ratios shown in fig .",
    "[ f.pdel ] ]    returning the to lower panel of figure  [ f.ext ] , we have included the corresponding set of ` observed ' ratios for the same literature values of @xmath34 shown in the upper panel .",
    "again , the largest values of literature @xmath34 are outside the range of the models and the high veiling stars require an @xmath34 in excess of unity . for two thirds of the stars the ratios resulting from the ` kf @xmath34 ' , set by the @xmath22 10,000  k iso - temperature locus in the ratio - ratio plot of pa@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 versus br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 in figure  [ f.ext ] , fall on the same locus here suggesting it may offer a reasonable estimate for the extinction in many cases .",
    "clearly there is a need for a more definitive assessment of extinction in t tauri stars but that is not the purpose of this work .",
    "we do however conclude that the highest values of @xmath34 reported in the literature seem to be out of bounds for many stars .",
    "similarly some of the low extinctions in the literature are incompatible with either the case b or kf model for the five high mass accretion rate stars with strong emission excess at all wavelengths noted by fehk ( cw tau , dg tau , as 353a , hn tau and rw aur ) . for these stars , a@xmath132 in excess of 1 magnitude is the minimum required to move the line ratios into the realm of the models . while we do not consider our ` kf @xmath34 ' values to be definitive , since the assumption that the temperature in the hydrogen line formation region is identical in all ctts is an oversimplification , it will be of interest to compare them to new assessments of @xmath34 that will be possible with the new generation of high resolution and broad wavelength coverage spectrographs .",
    "correcting for extinction is notoriously difficult for embedded class i protostars , when the @xmath133 and @xmath30 bands may be the shortest accessible wavelengths and scattered light from envelopes as well as emission from accretion related phenomena are present .",
    "often a variety of techniques to recover @xmath34 are employed , and the result for a single star can differ by many magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the near infrared ratio - ratio relations investigated here offer an alternate way of addressing this problem . while the locus of theoretical predictions in the ratio - ratio planes are similar in both case b and the kf calculations ,",
    "we have shown in previous sections that those from kf provide a more likely scenario for the observed line ratios and we thus focus this discussion on the kf predictions .",
    "if an observed pair of hydrogen line ratios , such as pa@xmath4/pa@xmath3 versus br@xmath4/pa@xmath3 , or for more embedded objects br10/br@xmath4 versus br@xmath4/pa@xmath3 , are tracked back along a reddening vector until they intersect the kf model relations , an @xmath34 can be recovered if a temperature is adopted . however , since the range of iso - temperature loci from 5000 k to 20,000 k span only two magnitudes along a reddening vector , any adopted temperature in that range will give @xmath34 with a fractional uncertainty that is modest for deeply embedded sources .    as an illustration , in the top panel of figure  [ f.ext2 ]",

    "the uncorrected line ratios for these protostars , a subset of class i sources with @xmath137  mag identified from 2mass and spitzer colors between 1.2 and 24 by @xcite , show that the extinctions are considerably higher than the objects from caratti o garrati .",

    "the seds for these objects are being analyzed by the hops team , who determine extinctions by comparing the 1 to 870 spectra and photometry of each object to a grid of radiative transfer models first described by @xcite and generated with the code of @xcite , which yields the extinction from the intervening interstellar dust , the circumstellar envelope , and the accretion disk . as will be shown in a forthcoming paper ( fischer et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , the extinction derived in these two approaches is comparable , suggesting both may be a viable means of determining extinction to embedded sources , in contrast to commonly used approaches for class i extinctions .    in these illustrations not only",
    "can an @xmath34 be recovered from the intersection of the reddening vectors with the loci of the kf iso - temperature calculations , but this intersection also implies a unique value of the hydrogen number density , @xmath0 . for the 10 sources in l1641 the implied densities fall in the range @xmath138 @xmath2 , somewhat higher than for the ctts studied here . for the 12 sources from across the orion complex ,",
    "the implied densities span a wider range , from @xmath139 @xmath2 .",
    "while further investigation of the validity of the kf models applied to accreting systems is required , we consider this a promising approach to further our understanding of class i sources as well as ctts .",
    "paschen and brackett lines are some of the strongest lines in near infrared spectra of accreting young stars",
    ". they are superior to the balmer series for line ratio diagnostics since they are less subject to uncertainties in extinction , and to the opacity effects that riddle the balmer series with blueshifted and redshifted absorption .",
    "we have focussed here on velocity resolved paschen and brackett lines in a small sample of classical t tauri stars , primarily in tau - aur , in order to look for variations in the hydrogen line ratios as a function of mass accretion rate and to compare them to theoretical models for hydrogen line formation .",
    "the primary strength of this work is to show the limitations of using case b predictions to interpret ctts hydrogen line ratios and to demonstrate the potential of using the @xcite local line excitation predictions to infer physical conditions and extinction .",
    "we experimented with three methods for determining hydrogen line intensity ratios from emission equivalent widths . for the majority of our sample , those with strong emission and no redshifted absorption , we found almost identical ratios among the three methods .",
    "however , when the emission equivalent width is weak and/or if redshifted absorption is present , the line ratios corrected for these effects can be altered from directly observed values .",
    "for example in three stars the directly observed ratio of pa@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 exceeded unity but dropped to @xmath140 after correcting the directly measured line profile for the underlying veiled photospheric absorption and taking ratios only in regions of the line profile free of redshifted absorption .",
    "while the ratio of pa@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 can exceed unity in the kf models at densities exceeding @xmath0 = 10@xmath141 @xmath2 , the ratio of br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 is always below unity .",
    "thus it is surprising that while half the stars in a low resolution study of chameleon i and ii were found by @xcite to have br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 ratios similar to objects in tau - aur ( 0.1 to 0.4 ) , the remainder had larger ratios , with br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 between 0.5 and 2 .",
    "such large ratios are inconsistent with any case b scenario and outside of the range of kf calculations as well . as noted by the authors , these ratios could be explained by invoking line formation in optically thick ( i.e. , blackbody ) lte emission with @xmath104 k. however , the br@xmath4 intensity could appear to exceed pa@xmath3 at low resolution if the lines are subject to redshifted absorption , which would reduce emission from pa@xmath3 relative to br@xmath4 , and might go unnoticed in unresolved lines .",
    "high resolution spectra of the chamaeleon objects are required to see whether this group of stars has near infrared line profiles that differ from all other ctts observed to date , which are generally similar in their kinematic properties and thus suggestive of formation under similar conditions @xcite .    after correcting the intensity ratios for the effects mentioned above",
    ", we found a loose relation between near infrared hydrogen line ratios and @xmath42-band veiling , and thus the implied mass accretion rate . in the kf predictions , which we favor over case",
    "b , this would correspond to somewhat higher densities in the hydrogen line formation region in stars with higher accretion rates . in a previous study we found that pa@xmath3 line profiles from nirspec at @xmath142 25,000 showed kinematic behavior that correlated with the @xmath42-band veiling , where stars with higher veiling had broader line profiles @xcite .",
    "taken together , these results suggest stars with higher disk accretion rates have both higher densities and higher velocities in the line formation region .",
    "these high veiling stars also show extended blue wings with velocities in their hydrogen profiles in excess of what can be produced in magnetospheric infall , so winds along with funnel flows are likely implicated .",
    "a larger sample is required to see whether this connection between veiling and line ratios is real or is simply due to our small sample size , and whether there is a connection to the profile morphology .",
    "both case b and kf local line excitations predict a locus of line ratios that overlap with observations of ctts ; however , the behavior of the line ratio diagnostics leads us to favor the kf predictions over those of case b. the inconsistencies in interpreting line ratios among different case b diagnostics likely arises because the condition that the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath53 , is sufficiently small that radiative de - excitation occurs more rapidly than collisional excitation from @xmath52 , required to keep the paschen and brackett lines optically thin , is violated .",
    "additional evidence for the latter is the fact that 24% of ctts show redshifted absorption in pa@xmath4 when examined at high spectral resolution @xcite , which requires line opacities well in excess of unity . in contrast",
    "the kf predictions cover a large range of possible line opacities , self consistently taking into account the local density , temperature , and ionization rate .",
    "to enable others to compare their data with these calculations , we have assembled a set of hydrogen line ratios from the kf local line excitation models and make them publicly available on a web server for other researchers acquiring near infrared spectra of ctts .",
    "the site includes both the ratios used here , plus others based on h@xmath55 , br@xmath55 ( 4.05 @xmath25 m ) , h76 ( 12.4 @xmath25 m ) and h97 ( 11.3 @xmath25 m ) that may be useful for existing or planned observations .    under the kf assumptions ,",
    "the implied density in the hydrogen line formation region is within a factor of a few times @xmath117 @xmath2 for the 16 ctts in our sample , with the higher accretion rate stars at the higher end of the range .",
    "here we compare these densities to those expected from hydrogen lines that are formed in accretion funnels , and find they are somewhat lower than expected based on the models of @xcite , also adopted by @xcite . in these models",
    "balmer , paschen and brackett emission arises over the full length of the accretion columns and the mass accretion rate sets the density in the accretion columns . for example , in figure 2 of @xcite , for a fiducial case of an aligned , symmetric dipole flow with a maximum temperature of 8000 k and @xmath143 = @xmath144 @xmath7  yr@xmath8 , the density increases from @xmath118 to @xmath145 @xmath2 along the region of the accretion column where infall velocities exceed 100  km  s@xmath8 and much of the line emission arises .",
    "this @xmath143 is in line with about half the stars in our sample , based on pa@xmath3 line luminosities and shown in figure 1 , yet the hydrogen number densities we infer for these stars are at least an order of magnitude lower . for the remainder of our sample ,",
    "mass accretion rates are between @xmath146 and @xmath5 @xmath7  yr@xmath8 , which would have correspondingly lower densities in the funnel flow model .",
    "thus although the general behavior expected in the funnel flow models , that higher accretion rate objects would have higher densities in the accretion columns , is born out in the observations , there are discrepancies . whether these inconsistencies are serious challenges to the common assumption that hydrogen lines are formed primarily in funnel flows or not is difficult to say at this stage of the investigation .    another approach is to note that in magnetospheric accretion models the density in the immediate pre - shock gas is about an order of magnitude higher than that over most of the flow due to the channeling effect of the ` funnel ' ( e.g. , figures in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "thus if we amplify the number density we infer in the hydrogen line formation region , @xmath147 @xmath2 , by an order of magnitude to @xmath148 @xmath2 to reflect the corresponding immediate pre - shock densities , we can compare this to pre - shock densities based on modeling either optical / uv continuum emission excess or line ratios in the x - ray domain .",
    "for example , @xcite define an energy flux @xmath149 carried into the accretion shock by the funnel flow , where @xmath150 . in their models",
    "the free fall velocity @xmath151 is kept constant at around 300 km  s@xmath8 and the density @xmath152 in the immediate pre - shock gas sets the accretion shock energy . the correspondence between @xmath143 and @xmath153 is given by their equation 11 .",
    "applying this with the same @xmath143 as in the fiducial case cited above , @xmath154",
    "@xmath7  yr@xmath8 , the corresponding @xmath155 erg @xmath156 s@xmath8 implies a pre - shock number density @xmath18 @xmath2 , again about an order of magnitude higher than inferred from the near infrared line ratios . for stars at the low end of the mass accretion rates thought to apply to our sample , @xmath157 @xmath7  yr@xmath8 , the pre - shock number density would be two orders of magnitude smaller at @xmath117 @xmath2 , in this case larger than we would infer for the pre - shock density of these stars",
    ".    we can also look at the pre - shock densities derived from modeling the he - like triplets of and in x - ray spectra .",
    "these line ratios in ctts can not be explained by coronal emission and are attributed to formation in the accretion shock @xcite .",
    "a study of these line ratios in several low accretion rate ctts indicate pre - shock densities @xmath18 @xmath2 for two stars in our current study , bp tau and tw hya @xcite , again an order of magnitude higher than we would infer . moreover , although these pre - shock densities are in line with those from magnetospheric accretion models , the inferred mass accretion rates based on x - ray line ratios are @xmath158 @xmath7  yr@xmath8 for bp tau and @xmath159 @xmath7  yr@xmath8 for tw hya @xcite , an order of magnitude or more lower than would be inferred from figure 1 based on pa@xmath3 luminosities or from the accretion shock models of @xcite based on optical / uv continuum excess .",
    "the tendency for mass accretion rates inferred from x - ray line ratios to be consistently lower than those based on accretion shock models of optical / uv emission excess is recognized by @xcite , who suggest that this might arise from inhomogeneous spots , partial absorption in buried shocks , or the presence of accretion streams that impact at velocities considerably below free - fall speeds ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we have applied the kf calculations only to hydrogen line ratios .",
    "the kf local line excitation calculations also include , , , and so that when ratios of other species are included , we will be able not only to test the conclusions regarding density , but also set constraints on the temperature as well .",
    "although the accretion funnel paradigm as a source of the near infrared hydrogen emission lines has withstood more than a decade of scrutiny , there are growing indications that a deeper investigation is warranted . in an era where it will now be possible to simultaneously match line luminosities , line ratios , and high resolution line profiles from multiple lines over a wide spectral range and over several stellar rotation periods to those predicted from modern magnetospheric accretion models @xcite , with misaligned fields with multipole components , coupled with rigorous diagnostics of the physical conditions in the line formation region",
    ", we may be able to decipher what the relative contributions of funnel flows , accretion shocks , winds and the inner disk might be to the rich emission line spectra of ctts .",
    "the key conclusions from this work are    *   in our limited sample , we see a tendency for the hydrogen line ratios in ctts to have different behavior in stars of high and low veiling . in the higher veiling stars the paschen decrement is shallower and line ratios tend to be higher in ratio - ratio relations such as pa@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 versus br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 and br@xmath40@xmath9br@xmath4 versus br@xmath4@xmath9pa@xmath3 .",
    "this conclusion is independent of extinction uncertainties .",
    "however it is based on a relatively small sample of stars and needs to be examined in a larger context .",
    "*   the @xcite local line excitation calculations offer a more consistent interpretation of physical conditions in the hydrogen line formation region of t tauri stars than case b. under kf assumptions the density in the hydrogen line formation region lies within the range @xmath160 @xmath2 , with densities higher on average in stars with higher accretion rates .",
    "extinction uncertainties preclude a reliable temperature determination . under case",
    "b assumptions not only do different diagnostics yield different implied values of temperature and electron density in ctts , the range of implied values exceeds four orders of magnitude in electron density and a factor of ten in temperature . *",
