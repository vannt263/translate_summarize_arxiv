    "when dealing with field theory in cosmological context , one often encounters the problem that a field is not in a state which is the absolute minimum of the potential , the true vacuum , but in a metastable local minimum , the false vacuum , which is at higher free energy .",
    "the transition from false to true vacuum proceeds by a quantum mechanical tunnelling process or by a classical transition induced by thermal fluctuations for a system at finite temperature .",
    "the transition is local in space . during the transition a bubble is formed which is a region in space with true vacuum surrounded by false vacuum .",
    "the bubble just large enough not to collapse is called critical bubble .",
    "once nucleated , the bubble expands , converting false vacuum to true vacuum .",
    "if the mass of the higgs boson is not too large the electroweak phase transition is of first order and proceeds by bubble nucleation .",
    "this scenario is interesting because of the possibility to explain the baryon asymmetry within the minimal standard model @xcite .",
    "a quantity of fundamental importance for a phase transition is the transition rate .",
    "the nucleation rate per volume , @xmath0 , can be calculated from the bounce - solution of the euclidean field equation .",
    "this solution is also called classical solution . for a theory with only one scalar field @xmath1 with a potential @xmath2 one",
    "has to solve the equation of motion : @xmath3 the boundary condition is , that the solution @xmath4 tends to its false vacuum value if one of the @xmath5 tends to @xmath6 .",
    "the nucleation rate can be written in the form @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the euclidean action of the classical solution @xmath9 : @xmath10 in the semiclassical approximation the factor @xmath11 is given by an expression involving functional determinants @xcite .",
    "the negative logarithm is the one - loop contribution to the effective action .",
    "if @xmath2 only has a single minimum the bounce - solution does not exist .",
    "nevertheless , in some models the vacuum structure is not determined by @xmath2 alone but it is changed by radiative corrections .",
    "these can be calculated by taking into account the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field and those fields coupled to the scalar one @xcite .",
    "depending on the specific model , the radiative corrections yield an effective potential @xmath12 with different minima @xcite .",
    "the bounce - solution is then calculated from a field equation that contains this effective potential",
    ". however , the effective potential is only a part of the effective action .",
    "it does not take into account the space - time dependence of the background fields , i.  e.  terms , that depend on derivatives of the background fields .",
    "this raises the question , whether it is justified to neglect these terms in calculating the bounce @xcite . in case of the electroweak phase transition the bosonic as well as the fermionic contributions to the effective action",
    "have been calculated , based on a bounce - solution , that was determined from the effective potential and not the effective action @xcite . in @xcite an improvement to take into account non - local effects already for the calculation of the bounce was done by modifying the kinetic term of the background field .",
    "the radiative corrections were calculated using approximations as the derivative expansion @xcite and the heat kernel method @xcite or by exact numerical computation schemes @xcite .",
    "the corrections due to the bosonic sector ( gauge and higgs fields ) were found to be of the same order as the classical action .",
    "in such a case the non - local terms of the effective action are not negligible and should be taken into account when calculating the classical solution . as the fermionic corrections are small",
    "compared to the classical action @xcite , their non - local contributions to the effective action can be omitted in the equation of motion .    the standard procedure to calculate the nucleation rate works in the following way : first one adds the one - loop corrections of the effective potential to the classical action @xmath8 and gets an approximation @xmath13 of the one - loop effective action",
    ". based upon the functional form of @xmath13 the field equation is derived and the bounce is determined .",
    "this is used to evaluate @xmath13 and the prefactor @xmath11 of the transition rate which is given in more detail by @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the modulus of the eigenvalue of the bubble s unstable mode .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the product of all fluctuation determinants of the bosonic sector .",
    "aside the dominant fermionic contribution due to the top - quark which is usually taken into account for the setup of @xmath13 the fluctuation determinant due to fermions is neglected here .",
    "the aim of this paper is to improve the calculation of the bounce which is then used as the numerical input for the evaluation of the nucleation rate .",
    "it is no longer determined as a saddle point of @xmath13 but as a saddle point of the full one - loop effective action .",
    "i.  e. , it will be obtained as a self - consistent solution of the one - loop field equation : @xmath17    the problem is , that no analytic representation of the effective action in the one - loop approximation is known . in @xcite",
    "a numerical method to calculate the functional derivative of an effective action has been presented .",
    "it is based upon a computation scheme to determine full one - loop green s functions @xcite . in this paper",
    "this technique is applied to determine a bounce - solution from a field equation where the full space - time - dependence of the non - local terms of the quantum corrections to one - loop order is taken into account .",
    "as the numerical method to compute the functional derivative needs the background field as a numerically known input quantity the procedure we use to obtain the background field is iterative .",
    "it finally results in a self - consistent fixed point of the iteration condition , i.  e. a solution of the one - loop field equation ( [ olfeq ] ) .",
    "a one - loop green s function is a divergent quantity that has to be renormalized .",
    "an important issue of the presented method is the strict separation of the divergent parts , which have to be handled analytically , and the convergent part , which may be computed numerically . as no expansion in any quantity",
    "is needed a conceptual advantage of this method in contrast to approximation schemes like the derivative or the heat kernel expansion is that the unphysical infrared divergencies these approximations suffer from do not appear .    among the various models for which self - consistent solutions",
    "are interesting this paper deals with the electroweak phase transition .",
    "recent lattice calculations show that the perturbation theory is not reliable for higgs boson masses above @xmath18gev .",
    "the phase transition seems to disappear at a critical higgs boson mass which is in the range between @xmath19gev and @xmath20gev @xcite and the experimental lower limit of the higgs boson mass already is beyond @xmath19gev .",
    "hence , the generation of the baryon asymmetry at the phase transition of the standard model is ruled out already , and the interest has shifted to extensions of the standard model . nevertheless , the investigation of the first order phase transition at small higgs boson masses is still of interest and is at present actively studied on the lattice @xcite .",
    "some aspects of the transition , like the determination of the surface tension and the latent heat , are still in a state of development .",
    "hence , we have the possibility to develop new calculational methods in a well known model that are straightforward to extend to more complicated models .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in the next section the model will be specified and the relevant fluctuation operators are given .",
    "the next section deals with the renormalization of the effective action that is improved by resummation . in section  [ sec : numericmethods ]",
    "the formulas for the numerical procedure how to calculate the functional derivative of an effective action and the effective action itself are derived .",
    "finally the results are presented and discussed .",
    "the lagrangian of the su(2)-higgs model with gauge fields and fermions in the limit of vanishing electroweak mixing angle is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 here @xmath23 denotes the field strength tensor of the gauge fields , @xmath1 the higgs - doublet , @xmath24 the pauli matrices , @xmath25 the fermion fields of the quarks , @xmath26 the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field at temperature @xmath27 and @xmath28 the yukawa - couplings of the fermions to the higgs field .",
    "the sum @xmath29 runs over the different flavors and colors of the quarks .",
    "the critical electroweak bubble is a pure real higgs field configuration . on the classical level",
    "it is @xmath30 the configuration is taken to be stationary , i.  e.   time independent .",
    "as explained in the introduction the bubble profile calculated from the functional derivative of the classical action ( [ sclbounce ] ) does not exist because the tree - level potential @xmath31 only has a single minimum .",
    "hence , instead of the classical action one has to use the effective action . for the model under consideration this effective action is given by : @xmath32=s_{\\rm cl}[\\phi ] + s_{\\rm eff , gauge}[\\phi , t ] +    s_{\\rm eff , ferm}[\\phi ,",

    "usually it is calculated in the semiclassical approximation to one - loop order . in order to calculate the one - loop approximation one needs to know the fluctuation operators .",

    "is given by : @xmath38 one has to add a gauge - fixing term and the contributions of the faddeev - popov - ghosts to the lagrangian . here",
    "t hooft - feynman - background gauge is used : @xmath39 from @xmath40 the fluctuation operators are read of .",
    "they are given in euclidean metric as the bounce solution we want to obtain is a solution of an euclidean field equation .",
    "there are three contributions of the bosonic sector to the effective action .",
    "the first is due to the isoscalar fluctuations of the higgs field , the second is due to the coupled channel of the gauge - fields and the isovector components of the higgs field ( would - be - goldstone bosons ) and the last is due to the time component of the gauge fields and the faddeev - popov - ghosts . each of them can be written as : @xmath41 = c_i \\ln { \\cal j}_i = c_i \\ln \\det \\left (       \\frac{-\\partial^2 + { \\cal u}_i(\\phi)}{-\\partial^2+{\\cal u}_i(0 ) }    \\right)\\;.\\ ] ] in order to shorten the notation the quantities @xmath42 are introduced and one uses that the background field is time independent .",
    "the contribution of the top - quark is the dominant one in the fermionic sector .",

    "based upon the fluctuation operators given above the sum of the tree level potential @xmath31 and these one - loop corrections can be written as : @xmath45\\;,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48gev , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the form of the constants @xmath8 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 differs from those in @xcite , because of the contributions of the higgs boson and would - be - goldstone boson fluctuation taken into account here .",
    "the renormalization has been performed in the minimum of the classical potential at @xmath27 .",
    "the given representations of the effective action are quite formal .",
    "they are divergent and have to be renormalized .",
    "furthermore , they have to be evaluated for a system at finite temperature .",
    "this is done in the next section",
    "the vacuum structure is changed due to the contributions of the different fluctuating fields to the one - loop effective potential . the tree - level mass and the tree - level self - coupling of the higgs field",
    "are modified due to effects of finite temperature .",
    "they will be modified again by effects of higher order .",
    "dependent on the temperature these corrections are not negligible and a pure one - loop calculation is not reliable @xcite .    in order to take into account at least the dominant contributions of the higher order effects",
    "one has to consider the sum of one - loop - daisy - graphs , replacing the expressions due to the inserted tadpole - graphs by their leading temperature dependence which is proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "also the vertices are replaced by those which take into account the temperature dependence of the coupling .    in practice the summation of daisy - graphs is performed by replacing the tree - level - potential @xmath31 in the lagrangian by the high temperature potential @xmath55 given in the preceding section @xcite . then the fluctuation operators and the contributions to the effective action are determined .",
