    "the tightness of these relations is surprising , given the very different scales involved  from accretion onto the bh ( @xmath10pc scale ) , the dynamical sphere of influence of the bh ( pc scale ) to the size of the spheroid ( kpc scale )  and poses a challenge to any theoretical model explaining their origin .",
    "in general , the correlations are believed to indicate a close connection between galaxy formation and evolution and the growth of the bh .",

    "the biggest challenge is to measure the bh mass , given the pc - scale sphere of influence of the bh which needs to be resolved spatially through either gas or stellar dynamics ( see @xcite and @xcite for a recent compilation and references therein ; for a review see @xcite and references therein ) or from x - ray spectroscopy probing the existence of a central temperature peak of the interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "unfortunately , the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) often outshines the host galaxy , making it difficult to disentangle nuclear and host - galaxy light for an accurate measurement of the spheroid luminosity .",
    "also , measuring @xmath9 from stellar absorption lines is hampered by the contaminating agn continuum and emission lines .",
    "different groups have tackled these problems in distinct ways , e.g.  by using the [ ] emission line width as surrogate of @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or by using gravitational lensing to super - resolve the host galaxies of quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our group @xcite has focused on seyfert-1 galaxies - for which the nucleus is not as bright as for quasars - at moderate redshifts ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 , corresponding to look - back times of @xmath134 - 6 gyrs ) .",
    "the non - negligible stellar light produces strong enough absorption lines to measure @xmath9 from unresolved spectra , as shown by @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",

    "imaging allows for an accurate determination of the agn luminosity ( for an unbiased estimate of nuclear luminosity and hence @xmath0 ) and spheroid luminosity ( to create the @xmath0-@xmath1  relation ; ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper ii ) ) .",
    "we are thus able to simultaneously study both the @xmath0-@xmath9 and @xmath0-@xmath1  relations , allowing us to distinguish mechanisms causing evolution in @xmath9 ( e.g. , dissipational merger events ) and @xmath1  ( e.g.  through passive evolution due to aging of the stellar population , or dissipationless mergers ) .",
    "results presented in paper i , ii , and iii suggest an offset with respect to the local relationships , which can not be accounted for by known systematic uncertainties . at a given @xmath0 , in the range 10@xmath14 - 10@xmath15 m@xmath16 , spheroids had smaller velocity dispersion and spheroid mass 6 gyrs ago ( @xmath17 , consistent with recent growth and evolution of intermediate - mass spheroids .",
    "paper ii concludes that the distant spheroids have to grow by @xmath1360% in stellar mass ( @xmath18 = 0.20 @xmath6 0.14 ) at fixed black hole mass in the next 4 billion years to obey the local scaling relations if no significant bh growth is assumed , consistent with the relatively low eddington ratios .",
    "indeed , the hst images reveal a large fraction of merging or interacting systems , suggesting that gas rich mergers will be responsible for the spheroid growth .",
    "although tantalizing , the results presented in our previous papers suffer from several limitations .",
    "samples were small , and the local comparison sample of seyferts measured in a self - consistent manner was even smaller than the distant sample , thus contributing substantially to the overall error budget .",
    "the limited range in black hole mass was insufficient to determine independently the offset of the scaling relation and its scatter , while taking into account selection effects . if the @xmath0-@xmath9 and @xmath0-@xmath1  relations of active galaxies were not as tight as those for quiescent ones , selection effects could be mimicking evolutionary trends @xcite .    to overcome these limitations ,",
    "we have now doubled the sample size ( from 20 in paper ii to 40 total here ) and expanded the covered range of bh masses to lower masses ( from @xmath19 @xmath0/@xmath20 in paper ii to @xmath19 @xmath0/@xmath21 here ) .",

    "we here briefly summarize the procedure .",
    "all objects were selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 ) archive according to the following criteria : ( 1 ) redshift in either the 0.35 @xmath7 @xmath28 @xmath7 0.37 bin or the 0.56 @xmath7 @xmath28 @xmath7 0.58 bin , ( 2 ) h@xmath29 equivalent width and gaussian width @xmath30 5  in the rest frame .",
    "objects with @xmath26 were selected to extend the bh mass scaling relations presented in paper i , ii , and iii to the low - mass range .",
    "they meet the additional criterion ( 3 ) @xmath0  @xmath31 as determined from the width of the h@xmath29 line and the @xmath32 luminosity measured from the sdss spectra and assuming the calibration given by @xcite .    for two objects in paper ii ( 0107 and 1015 )",
    "the acs images revealed dust lanes .",
    "thus , near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) images were additionally obtained to correct for extinction .",
    "table  [ data ] summarizes the sample properties of all 23 objects .",
    "the sample was observed using the nic2 camera and the broad filter f110w ( @xmath13 @xmath33-band ) of nicmos on board hst .",
    "the 17 objects at @xmath28 = 0.36 were observed for a total exposure time of 2560 seconds per object ( 11 as part of go 11208 , pi woo ; 6 as part of go 11341 , pi gallagher ) ; the 6 objects at @xmath28 = 0.57 were observed for a total exposure time of 5120 seconds per object ( go 11208 ; pi treu ) .",
    "four separate exposures were obtained per object , dithering by semi - integer pixel offsets to recover resolution lost to under - sampling and to improve cosmic - ray and defect removal .",
    "the individual exposures were first processed with the nicmos calnica pipeline ( version 4.4.0 ) , and then dither - combined using a custom - made pipeline written in iraf / stsdas dither package ( version 3.4.2 ) .",
    "the pipeline relies on the package drizzle and takes care of aligning the images , removing sky background , correcting for the pedestal effect ( the variable quadrant bias present in nicmos images ) using `` pedsky '' , and the nicmos non - linearity using `` rnlincor '' , identifying and removing cosmic rays and defect pixels and finally drizzling all input images together . for our final drizzle iteration",
    "we chose a drizzle.pixfrac parameter of 0.9 and a drizzle.scale parameter of 0.5 , which resulted in a final scale of 0.038 arcsec / pixel . in figure",
    "[ nicmos ] , postage stamp images of all 23 objects are shown .",
    "( we refer the reader to paper ii for the acs images of those 2 objects in our sample , 0107 and 1015 , for which we have both acs and nicmos images . )",
    "to decompose nuclear and host - galaxy light ( spheroid and potentially bar or disk ) , we used galfit , a 2d galaxy fitting program that can simultaneously fit one or more objects in an image choosing from a library of functional forms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * exponential , etc . )",
    "decomposition of complex images in multiple components is a difficult statistical challenge due the degeneracies involved , and the highly non - linear dependency of the likelihood on a large number of parameters . to deal with this problem",
    ", we develop a methodology based on physical assumptions to reduce the number of free parameters and extensive trial and error exploration of the multidimensional space to avoid local minima of the posterior probability .",
    "this section describes our fitting procedure in detail .      for convolution with the point - spread function ( psf ) of the _ hst _ nicmos optics , and to fit the central point source of the agn , we created psfs using tinytim ( version 6.3 ) .",
    "compared to other cameras onboard hst , tinytim produces fairly good psfs for nicmos ( and especially nic2 ) because the psf is less sensitive to aberrations in the infrared @xcite ; generally , tinytim psfs are considered an adequate alternative when well - matched stellar psfs are not available @xcite .    to minimize psf mismatch due to spatial distortion",
    ", we simulated psfs at the location of the objects .",
    "we created a library of 17 psfs using a wide range of different stellar templates ( f6v to k7v ) and power - law functions ( @xmath34 with @xmath35 to @xmath36 in increments of 0.5 ) at the four different chip positions of the individual exposures of the science targets .",
    "these four images were then dither - combined using the same procedure as for the science targets . to account for breathing",
    ", we additionally created psf models for the above range with focus values of @xmath65 @xmath10 m around the nominal focus @xcite .",
    "we created noise images by dither - combining the necessary extension files provided in the image block ( the output of the calnica pipeline ; see nicmos data handbook version 7.0 ) in the same way as the associated science image .      for each object",
    ", we assumed the following agn / host galaxy fitting procedure using galfit .",
    "we first fitted the central agn component with a psf , and thus determined the center of the system , which was subsequently assumed to be common to all components and fixed .",
    "we then modeled the spheroid component with a @xcite profile .",
    "we carefully checked the images and the residuals for evidence of a disk component and added an exponential disk if required by the images , residuals , and the @xmath37 statistics .",
    "the same approach was used to determine the need for an additional bar component , but unlike in paper ii ( where seven out of 17 objects required the fitting of a bar ) , we did not find evidence for a bar in any of the objects in our sample .",
    "neighboring objects were fitted simultaneously .",
    "note that the sky was determined independently and subtracted out during pipeline reduction ( see above ) which is preferable when using galfit , as the sky background is not only degenerate with the extended wing of the galaxy , but it might also be used by galfit to compensate a mismatch between intrinsic and fitted galaxy profile @xcite .    to ensure that the best resulting fit indeed corresponds to the true global minimum of the @xmath37 over the parameter space , we performed a careful inter - comparison between different fits with a variety of initial parameters and combinations of components .",
    "finally , each galaxy was fitted with all psfs in the library to find the best - fitting psf and thus , the best - fitting parameters , and to estimate uncertainties due to psf mismatch .",
    "the differences in derived spheroid and psf magnitudes using different psfs in our library are small ( @xmath38 mag ) and negligible compared to other systematic errors . to understand these systemic errors",
    ", we simulated artificial images spanning the same parameter space as our objects and tested how reliably galfit can retrieve the different components ( see appendix  [ sec : mc ] ) .",
    "we use the results to estimate our uncertainties and adopt a conservative total uncertainty on the spheroid luminosity of 0.5 mag ( i.e. , 0.2 dex ) .",
    "the agn luminosity is uncertain to within 0.2 mag .",
    "the dominating error when constructing the bh mass - spheroid luminosity relation is the uncertainty of bh masses from single - epoch measurements , @xmath130.4 dex .",
    "a psf+spheroid decomposition gives a satisfactory fit to the host galaxies of ten out of the 23 objects ( see table  [ results ] ) .",
    "the remaining 13 objects show evidence for a disk component in both the residual image and in the @xmath37 statistics and thus , an additional exponential disk component was added . however , in ten of the 13 objects , the addition of a disk component results in a vanishingly small spheroidal component . in these cases , we fixed the spheroidal half - light radius to the minimum resolvable size of 2.5 pixels ( @xmath130.1 ) , as determined by simulations , and consider the measured spheroid luminosity an upper limit . for one object ( 1501 )",
    ", even fitting a single spheroid component had the same effect .",
    "below , we discuss how we combined these upper limits with informative priors on the spheroid - to - total luminosity ratio for galaxies to estimate spheroid luminosities .    note that compared to the acs images studied in paper ii , nicmos images are less sensitive to a potential disk component , dominated by young , blue stars",
    ". we can not exclude to have missed a disk component in some of the objects for which we only fit a spheroidal component",
    ". however , this is a conservative approach , i.e.  reducing any potential offset in the @xmath0-@xmath1  relation .",
    "this is true in general for our procedure : we only fit a two component model consisting of disk+bulge , if there is irrefutable evidence for a disk component ( see e.g.  fig .  [ nicmos ] ) . without such evidence , using only one component",
    "is conservative in the same sense above .    in figs .",
    "[ profiles1 ] and  [ profiles2 ] , we show surface - brightness profiles derived using the iraf program `` ellipse '' , for the data as well as each component that was fitted using galfit .",
    "as the fitting was done in two dimensions , these figures should be considered as illustrations only , showing the relative contributions of the different components to the total fit as a function of radius .",
    "we divide the sample in two groups , based on the quality of the fit : in fig .",
    "[ profiles1 ] , we show all objects that were fitted by a resolved spheroid component ; in fig .",
    "[ profiles2 ] , we show objects with an unresolved spheroid component , i.e.  those for which galfit ran into the size limit of the spheroid of 2.5 pixels .    in appendix  [",
    "sec : sersic ] , we discuss the effects of the choice of different srsic indices other than @xmath39=4 ( i.e.  a @xcite profile ) .",
    "to briefly summarize , all results stated in the paper remain the same within the errors , when choosing the best - fitting srsic index instead of @xmath39=4 .",
    "as described above , for ten objects the addition of a disk component resulted in a vanishingly small spheroidal component . for one object ( 1501 ) , even a single spheroid component had the same effect .",
    "thus , for these 11 objects , we fixed the spheroidal half - light radius to the minimum resolvable size of 2.5 pixels and inferred an upper limit to the bulge luminosity .",
    "the same is true for five objects in paper ii and we thus include them in the analysis described here . in brief ,",
    "we combine the upper limit on spheroid magnitude with prior knowledge on bulge - to - total luminosity ratios ( b / t ) as a function of total host - galaxy magnitude . in terms of bayes theorem",
    ", we derive the posterior on b / t by combining our likelihood  in the form of a step function limited to the measured upper limit from galfit  with a prior taken from the literature .",
    "the prior is determined from quantitative measurements of the distribution of spheroid - to - total luminosity ratios @xcite , derived for a sample of @xmath138800 galaxies from sdss , using the 2d fitting code galactica @xcite .",
    "the galaxy redshifts span a range of 0.02 @xmath7 z @xmath7 0.3 with an average of 0.09 .",
    "the absolute r magnitudes of these galaxies are comparable to our sample ( 80% of the @xcite galaxies are within our range of @xmath40 ) .    for each object in our sample",
    ", we performed the following steps . first , we selected only objects from @xcite , for which the total galaxy magnitude is within @xmath60.5 mag of the seyfert total host - galaxy magnitude ( which is typically accurate to @xmath41 0.1 mag ) .",
    "then , we created a histogram over the b / t values of the benson et al .",
    "galaxies within this magnitude range ( step size of 0.1 ) and cut this histogram at the upper limit of b / t we derived for the seyfert galaxies . finally , we calculated the mean and sigma of the remaining b / t values and used this value to derive the spheroid luminosity for the seyfert galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ prior ] , we show the prior , likelihood , and posterior distribution functions for all 16 objects .",
    "the upper limit and mean posterior b / t ratio is also shown .      for two objects ( 0107 and 1015 ) ,",
    "the acs f775w images studied in paper ii reveal dust lanes in the host galaxy , preventing an accurate measurement of the agn and spheroid luminosity from the acs images alone .",
    "thus , nicmos f110w images were obtained , which we use here for dust correction .",
    "briefly , the color excess is measured from the two colors and used to correct for dust extinction assuming an extinction law .",
    "the procedure we adapt is similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "first , we deconvolved the acs image using the acs psf from paper ii and a lucy - richardson algorithm ( iraf program `` lucy '' ) .",
    "then , the f775w image was rotated to match the orientation of the nicmos image and drizzled to the same pixel scale .",
    "we assume that the centroids are unaffected by the dust lane ",
    "an assumption supported by the distribution of the dust seen in the images  and we thus centered both images on their peaks . in the next step , the f775w image was convolved by the nicmos psf ( iraf program `` imconvolve '' ) to match the resolution of the f110w image . then",
    ", a color map was created from the ratio of these matched images and the intrinsic color was assumed to correspond to the minimum of the color and to be spatially uniform .",
    "finally , the color excess was converted into extinction assuming @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( corresponding to rest - frame f814w ) , and @xmath44 ( corresponding to rest - frame f555w ) .",
    "the extinction - corrected nicmos image was used for fitting with galfit .",
    "we applied correction for galactic extinction , assuming @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the values for @xmath47 were taken from @xcite .",
    "the f110w ab magnitudes were transformed to rest - frame optical bands by performing synthetic photometry on an early - type galaxy template spectrum , a procedure traditionally referred to as k - correction .",
    "the template spectrum initially has arbitrary units , and these units were adjusted so that the synthetic observed frame f110w magnitudes match the magnitudes from our photometry .",
    "we then evaluated the v - band magnitudes at the rest - frame of the template ; luminosities were determined by correcting for the distance modulus given our adopted cosmology .",
    "the errors on extinction and rest - frame transformation are a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "we note that the f110w band roughly corresponds to the r and i bands for our two intermediate - redshift samples ; considering the small scatter in the red colors of bulges ( that is , the v - r and v - i colors ) we are able to determine robust estimates of the v - band magnitude .",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of @xmath70.05 mag ( using the scatter in 20 single stellar population templates with ages ranging from 2 gyr to 8 gyr ) .      to allow a direct comparison of the observed relation in the more distant universe and local samples , we evolved the spheroid luminosity according to the evolution measured from the evolution of the fundamental plane by @xcite : @xmath48 this corrects pure passive luminosity evolution , i.e.  the decrease in spheroid luminosity due to an aging stellar population",
    ". we used the same correction for our intermediate - z seyfert sample and for the local rm agns which will be discussed in ",
    "[ ssec : lowzcomp ] .",
    "however , equation  [ eq : evo ] is only valid below @xmath49 and an equivalent measurement is not available at higher redshift .",
    "therefore , for the high - z sample we adopt a conservative correction based on the predicted evolution for a maximally old stellar population ( see   [ ssec : highzcomp ] ) .      as in paper",
    "i , ii , and iii of this series , black hole masses were estimated using the empirically calibrated photo - ionization method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed discussion see paper ii ) .",
    "briefly , the method ( sometimes called the `` virial '' method ) assumes that the kinematics of the gaseous region in the immediate vicinity of the bh , the broad line region ( blr ) , traces the gravitational field of the bh .",
    "the width of the broad emission lines ( e.g.  h@xmath29 ) gives the velocity scale , while the blr size is given by the continuum luminosity through application of an empirical relation found from reverberation mapping ( rm ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "combining size and velocity gives the bh mass , assuming a dimensionless coefficient of order unity to describe the geometry and kinematics of the blr ( sometimes known as the `` virial '' coefficient ) .",
    "this coefficient can be obtained by matching the @xmath0-@xmath9 relation of local active galactic nuclei ( agns ) to that of quiescent galaxies @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the coefficient can be postulated under specific assumptions on the geometry and kinematics of the blr .",
    "we note that the exact value of the virial factor does not affect our results since the relative offset between local and higher redshift agns should be independent of the virial factor .",
    "we use the following formula which includes calibrations of the blr size - luminosity relation ( after subtraction of host galaxy light ; @xcite ) and a virial coefficient taken from @xcite : @xmath50 with @xmath51 the second moment of the broad h@xmath29 emission line and @xmath52 the observed nuclear luminosity at 5100 .    to obtain the 5100  continuum luminosity of the agn",

    "* see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "first , the role of radiation pressure on the measurement of bh masses is still discussed controversially and second , neglecting its effects is a conservative approach : if radiation pressure does affect the motion of the blr clouds , not taking it into account would lead to an underestimation of the bh mass .",
    "thus , including radiation pressure , the observed offset would further increase .",
    "all results are summarized in table  [ results ] .",
    "in addition to the 23 objects in the sample studied here , we give the results for the sample in paper ii , which changed slightly ( @xmath70.15 mag ) due to a small error in the extinction correction in paper ii ( consequently , also the derived bh masses changed slightly ) . also , we determined spheroid luminosities for those objects in paper ii that only had upper limits by applying the informative prior",
    ". moreover , paper ii used the b - band luminosity of the spheroid component ( for comparison with inactive galaxy samples in the local universe ) .",
    "we here give the v - band luminosity of the spheroid component .",
    "interpreting the @xmath0-@xmath1  relation for the distant seyfert samples studied here and any possible evolution with redshift requires a robust local baseline  ideally of seyfert galaxies with comparable bh masses and spheroid luminosities to avoid selection biases as much as possible .",
    "the most appropriate local comparison sample for our study is the reverberation - mapped sample of 35 agn hosts .",
    "this sample has the great advantage that the bh mass is derived directly via rm and does not depend on the blr size - luminosity relation and its uncertainties . a detailed analysis of hst images of the rm sample to derive agn and spheroid luminosities was recently completed by @xcite .",
    "however , a comparison with our study is not straightforward due to their very different approach which aims to get the best estimate of agn - to - host - galaxy luminosity ratio . in particular , while we use the simplest decomposition possible , i.e.  psf , spheroid ( modeled as simple @xcite profile ) plus possible exponential disk , @xcite allow the srsic index to vary , sometimes include more than one psf for the same galaxy ( to compensate for psf mismatch ) , and up to three different spheroid components .",
    "we thus decided to perform an independent analysis of the hst archival images , for a homogeneous treatment of all the data , using the same approach as for our distant seyfert galaxies .",

    "while not every object in the intermediate - z sample will experience a major merger in the last 4 - 6 billion years , secular evolution is a promising alternative way to grow the spheroidal components in these objects . but even if they do experience a major merger ( as indeed evidenced for at least some objects in our sample ) , the role of the merger depends on the merger type as discussed above ( e.g.  a merger between similar objects will simply move the system along the local relation ) .",
    "there may again be a dependency on bh mass : for the low - mass objects , the offset becomes almost negative , indicating that in the low - mass range , either the bh is , at the same time , still growing by a non - negligible amount ( consistent with the higher eddington ratio in the low - mass regime ) or that not all of the stellar mass will end up in the spheroid component .",
    "indeed , for local rm agns , at least 6/19 objects reside in late - type host galaxies ( preferentially those with lower bh masses ) .",
    "\\(b ) the relation between bh mass and host - galaxy luminosity ( or mass ) may be the more fundamental one .",
    "indeed , this is predicted by @xcite : in his thought experiment , he shows that a tight linear relation between @xmath0  and host - galaxy mass can evolve  if the galaxy mass function declines with increasing mass  due to `` a central - limit - like tendency for galaxy mergers , which is much stronger for major mergers than for minor mergers , and a convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers '' . also , it is possible that bhs in late - type galaxies or galaxies without classical bulges , while not following the same @xmath0  scaling relations as spheroids ( see discussion in   [ ssec : scatter ] ) , they instead obey a more fundamental relation between bh mass and host - galaxy mass .",
    "however , the relation between host - galaxy luminosity and @xmath0  seems to exist only up to z@xmath411 : the offset for the high - z comparison sample does not decrease as the luminosity given by @xcite is already the total host - galaxy luminosity ( the same is true also for the results by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . along the line of argument of ( a ) above",
    ", the growth of the spheroid above a redshift of @xmath107 can not simply be achieved through secular evolution ( with quasars being predominantly hosted by ellipticals ) , but instead , major mergers are needed .",
    "a major merger is more likely to happen for the high - z sample given the longer time span . or , following ( b ) ,",
    "a relation between bh mass and host galaxy is already at place at @xmath49 , but still evolving at earlier times .",
    "however , we can not exclude that part of the difference is due to the difference in bh mass between the samples , with the high - z objects generally having larger bh masses .    in the end ,",
    "the discussion boils down to the following question : what is the dominant mechanism that grows spheroids , and does it depend on spheroid mass and/or redshift ?",
    "this is debated controversially in the theoretical literature .",
    "for example , based on their semi - analytic models , @xcite find that the majority of ellipticals and spirals never experience a major merger but rather , that they acquire their spheroid stellar mass through minor mergers or disc instabilities .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , combine empirically constrained halo occupation distributions with high - resolution merger simulations , and find that major mergers dominate the formation of @xmath13@xmath108 bulges and systems with higher b / t , but that lower - mass or lower b / t systems are preferentially formed by minor mergers .",
    "they predict that the major merger rate increases with redshift .",
    "qualitatively , we can reconcile such a scenario with our results : higher - mass objects and those at higher redshifts ( i.e.  the majority of the high - z sample ) form their spheroids preferentially through major mergers and are thus still evolving toward a @xmath0-@xmath74  relation , while lower - mass and lower - z objects ( i.e.  our intermediate - z sample ) grow their spheroids through minor mergers or disk instabilities that redistribute the stars and thus , they fall on the @xmath0-@xmath74  relation .",
    "theoretical studies generally invoke mergers to explain the observed scaling relations between bh mass and host - galaxy spheroid properties  a promising way to grow both spheroid and bh . in a simple scenario ,",
    "spheroids grow by ( i ) the merging of the progenitor bulges ( assuming that both progenitors have a spheroidal component ) , ( ii ) merger - triggered starbursts in the cold galactic disk , and ( iii ) by transforming stellar disks into stellar spheroids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus increasing the spheroid luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the fueling of the bh , on the other hand , is triggered by the merger event as the gas loses angular momentum , spirals inward and eventually gets accreted onto the bh , giving rise to the bright agn or quasar period in the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "eventually , if bhs are present in the center of both progenitor galaxies , they may coalesce .",
    "in such a simple scenario , an evolution in the bh mass - spheroid luminosity relation is not necessarily expected : both spheroid and bh grow from the same gas reservoir , and bulge stars added to the final spheroid followed the bh mass - spheroid luminosity relation prior to merging , so the relation will be preserved when the bhs coalesce . however , while mergers provide a way to grow both spheroids and bhs , they may do so on very different timescales .",
    "moreover , the merger history of galaxies varies , depending e.g.  on formation time and environment .",
    "different types of merger , for example with a different relative role of dissipation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have different effects on the growth of spheroid and bh : for a gas - rich major merger between an elliptical galaxy and a spiral galaxy - the latter without a ( massive ) bh  the bulge grows more efficiently than the bh by the disruption of the stellar disk @xcite .",
    "in general , our images of the intermediate - z seyfert galaxies support the merger scenario ( see fig .",
    "[ nicmos ] and   [ ssec : merger ] ) .",
    "however , objects with evidence for merger / interaction do not form any particular outliers in the bh mass - spheroid luminosity relation ( fig .",
    ". this may not be too surprising : for those objects for which we still see two separate galaxies in the process of merging , we fitted both separately and the bulge luminosity of the agn host has not yet increased from the process of merging",
    ". other objects with signs of interaction may be in a later evolutionary stage where the bulge luminosity has already increased and thus , the object falls closer to the local relation .",
    "finally , mergers between similar objects would only move the system parallel to the local relation . in general , the effect of mergers on the measured bulge luminosity of an object depends on the type of the merger , the evolutionary stage of the merger , and the timescales involved to grow spheroid and bh .",
    "such a detailed comparison of merger type and age with theoretical predictions is beyond the scope of this paper , given the small sample of merging objects and the limited information at hand .",
    "note that the fraction of apparently disturbed systems we find is not higher than that of a comparison sample of inactive galaxies at the same redshift (  [ ssec : merger ] ) .",
    "thus , from our images alone , we can not infer a causal link between a merger / interaction event and the agn activity we observe . instead ,",
    "`` normal '' galaxies may have the same merger history , and ongoing interactions are not necessarily predictive of agn activity .",
    "the role of mergers for the fueling of agns is debated in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while there is little doubt that mergers are helpful , they are certainly not a sufficient condition , considering the numerous inactive interacting galaxies .",
    "also , mergers may be necessary for the high - luminosity qsos only while for seyfert galaxies , secular evolution through processes such as bar instabilities may be the dominant effect in the evolution of these galaxies .",
    "we will come back to this issue in ",
    "[ ssec : mbhtotr ] .",
    "we study the evolution and intrinsic scatter of the bh mass - spheroid luminosity relation , taking into account selection effects , by combining three different samples of agns .",
    "our intermediate - redshift sample comprises 40 seyfert-1 galaxies at two different redshift bins ( 34 objects at z=0.36 , and 6 objects at z=0.57 ; look - back time 4 - 6 gyr ) for which we measure the bh mass from single - epoch keck spectra .",
    "the sample spans more than one order of magnitude in bh mass ( log @xmath0/@xmath109=7.5 - 8.8 ) .",
    "2d surface - brightness photometry using galfit is carried out on high - resolution hst images to decompose the image into agn and host - galaxy components .",
    "the low - z comparison sample consists of 19 local agns ( @xmath110 ; @xmath111 ) with reverberation bh masses @xcite .",
    "we re - analyzed the archival hst images in a way comparable to our intermediate - z seyfert galaxies to eliminate possible systematic offsets .",
    "finally , we combine our results with high - z data ( 44 quasars from 0.66 @xmath58 @xmath28 @xmath58 4.5 ; @xmath112 ) compiled from the literature , mainly consisting of gravitationally - lensed agns @xcite that were treated in a self - consistent manner . for all objects ,",
    "the spheroid luminosity is corrected for passive luminosity evolution .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "*   we determine the evolution in @xmath0  with an unprecedented accuracy , taking into account selection effects . our result , @xmath0/@xmath1@xmath2@xmath5 , indicates that bh growth precedes host - spheroid assembly .",
    "the intrinsic scatter , assumed to be non - evolving , is non - negligible ( 0.3@xmath60.1 dex ; @xmath70.6 dex at 95% cl ) .",
    "it may reflect the different ways and timescales involved when growing spheroids or may partially be due to a high fraction of spirals and/or potential pseudobulges in our sample .",
    "*   the local and intermediate - z sample follow an apparently non - evolving @xmath0-_host - galaxy _ luminosity relation .",
    "either the spheroid grows by a redistribution of stars , or the relation between bh mass and host galaxy is more fundamental . above @xmath8 ,",
    "the relation seems to be still forming , e.g.  through major mergers .",
    "we are currently studying the evolution of the bh mass - spheroid velocity dispersion relation ( woo et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) , which should allow us to tighten the error bars on evolution given that velocity dispersion can be measured more precisely than host luminosity .",
    "studying this independent relation will also enable us to distinguish between different evolutionary scenarios , probe the `` fundamental plane '' between @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and perform further tests for systematics . due to the failure of nicmos in fall 2008 , nine objects at @xmath12 and three objects at @xmath11 were not observed .",
    "instead , we were recently allocated time with wfc3 to complete the full sample of seyfert-1 galaxies .",
    "we will present results for this extended sample in another paper . at the same time , increasing the local agn comparison sample would be desirable ( and indeed an hst proposal for the eight nearest rm agns by bentz et al .",
    "is in the queue ) . understanding slope and scatter of the local relations for active galaxies is crucial to study their evolution .",

    "to probe the reliability of galfit to derive the agn and host - galaxy properties accurately and to estimate the systematic uncertainties involved in the fitting , we ran monte carlo simulations of a set of different galaxy models .",
    "a comparable procedure was carried out by @xcite .    in particular , we used galfit to simulate galaxies , consisting of ( a ) psf plus spheroid , and ( b ) psf plus spheroid plus disk using a range of typical galaxy properties of our sample . in both cases ,",
    "the total magnitude was set to either 18 or 19 mag .",
    "for case ( a ) , we assumed the effective radius of the spheroid to be @xmath114 = 4 pix , 6 pix , 8 pix , and an agn - to - total luminosity ratio of 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 0.95 . in case ( b ) , the effective radius of the spheroid was set to @xmath114 = 3 pix , 4 pix , 6 pix , 8 pix ( to additionally probe the lower limit which can be a problem when fitting spheroid plus disk ) . for an",
    "agn - to - total luminosity ratio of 0.8 ( 0.5 ) , the spheroid - to - disk ratio was 0.5 ( 0.2 , 0.5 ) , and for an agn - to - total luminosity ratio of 0.2 and 0.1 , a spheroid - to - disk ratio of 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 was used .    note that this is a conservative approach , focusing on the parameter space for which the detection of the spheroid component is most difficult , i.e.  a small spheroid size , a small spheroid - to - disk luminosity ratio and a large agn - total galaxy luminosity ratio .",
    "the galaxies were simulated with a given psf and noise was added based on a typical observed signal - to - noise ( sn ) ratio in a monte carlo fashion creating 100 artificial images which were then fitted by galfit . in a first run ,",
    "the simulated galaxies were fitted with the same psf that was used to create the artificial images , in subsequent runs with different psfs from our psf library to simulate psf mismatch .    for case",
    "( a ) , galfit can easily recover the sizes and magnitudes , even when the spheroid reaches sizes close to the minimum size that can be resolved given the psf ( here assumed to be 2.5 pixels ) . in fig .",
    "[ montecarlobonly ] , we show the resulting offsets for the smallest spheroid ( @xmath114 = 4 pix )",
    ". however , more caution needs to be exercised for a three - component fit ( psf , spheroid , and disk ) , probed in case ( b ) . in fig .",
    "[ montecarlobd ] , we show the resulting offsets for the smallest spheroid ( @xmath114 = 3 pix ) , i.e.  the most difficult scenario for retrieving the spheroid parameters accurately . the derived spheroid magnitude can differ up to 0.5 mag in the worst case , while the difference in psf magnitude is less than 0.2 mag .",
    "we adopt these values as conservative measures of our errors , i.e.  0.2 mag for agn luminosity and 0.5 mag for spheroid luminosity .",
    "as the estimation of errors is the main purpose of this analysis , we do not further discuss the results of these simulations .",
    "the overall trend is the same as in @xcite , i.e.  the scatter in all derived parameters is largest when the agn is dominant , and when @xmath114 is small and difficult to distinguish from the nucleus or large with low surface brightness .",
    "spheroid - to - disk - to - agn decompositions are much more difficult than spheroid - to - agn as they involve 6 additional free parameters ( if the spheroid is fitted by a @xcite profile ) and can only be done if the s / n is high .",

    "disk galaxies typically have a bulge component with @xmath117 , with classical bulges having @xmath118 and pseudobulges having @xmath119 @xcite .",

    "the objects we are fitting are complex in nature , in particular due to the presence of the agn , a very luminous point source in the center for which a perfectly matching psf fit can not always be achieved .",
    "thus , we can not use a fit with the srsic index @xmath39 as a free parameter , as it would add yet another free component to an already difficult fit and increase degeneracies between psf , bulge , and disk .",
    "such an approach could easily lead to an unphysical fit , if galfit is trying to fit any remaining psf mismatch with such a component .",
    "in such a situation , an alternative approach to estimate the best fitting srsic exponent is to use a range of srsic indices , keep them fixed at each step and then obtain the best @xmath39 from the resulting the @xmath37 statistics .",
    "this approach is generally recommended when attempting galaxy decompositions of faint or difficult to model galaxies like agn host galaxies @xcite .    to test the systematic uncertainties in derived spheroid and psf magnitude depending on the adopted srsic index , we re - ran our models using @xmath120 to fit the spheroid component . at each step",
    ", we kept @xmath39 fixed to the chosen value but allowed all other parameters to vary , including the disk component .",
    "for those objects that were initially ( i.e. when using @xmath39=4 ) fit by a spheroid component only , we carefully checked the residuals of the resulting best @xmath39 fit for any evidence of an additional disk component . for only one source ( 1501 )",
    "is the quality of the fit increased significantly by the addition of a disk component .",
    "note that using the best - fitting @xmath39 instead of @xmath39=4 does not in general solve the problem of a a vanishingly small bulge component for some objects . for 11 of the 16 objects discussed in ",
    "[ ssec : prior ] , nothing changes . for five objects ,",
    "the effective radius of the bulge component is no longer smaller than the fwhm of the psf ; however , for two different objects , the bulge component then becomes vanishingly small .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ sersic ] , separating objects for which the host galaxy was fitted by a spheroid component only ( left panel ) and those for which the host was fitted by a spheroid plus disk component ( right panel ) . while the overall trend is the same , fitting the host galaxy by two components results in a larger scatter because the disk magnitude can also vary .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows : decreasing @xmath39 from 4 to 3 ( 2 , 1 , 0.5 ) decreases the spheroid luminosity  on average by 0.08 ( 0.23 , 0.41 , 0.54 ) mag  and increases the nuclear luminosity  on average by -0.07 ( -0.24 , -0.37 , -0.4 ) mag .",
    "increasing @xmath39 from 4 to 5 ( 6 ) on the other hand increases the spheroid luminosity on average by -0.07 ( -0.13 ) mag and decreases the nuclear luminosity on average by 0.1 ( 0.22 ) mag .",
    "for all but the most extreme indices , potential systematics related to the choice of srsic index are small compared to the adopted uncertainty on the spheroid luminosity ( 0.5 mag ) and on @xmath0  ( 0.4 dex ) .",
    "another approach is to calculate the best srsic index we would expect based on the measured host - galaxy magnitude using the relation in @xcite , derived from surface - photometry of acs images of the well - defined virgo cluster sample @xcite @xmath121 for the 23 objects studied here , we estimate a srsic index ranging from @xmath134.0 to 5.9 , on average 4.9 @xmath6 0.5 . for the sample studied in paper ii ,",
    "the srsic index ranges from @xmath134 to 6.8 , with an average of 5.5 @xmath6 0.6 . within the errors",
    ", these values are in agreement with estimates using the relation between srsic index and bulge b - band magnitude for a local sample from @xcite ( their figure 14 , middle panel ) .",
    "note that in both cases , the estimated srsic index remains the same within the errors when using the host - galaxy luminosity ( for n - l relation from @xcite ) or bulge luminosity ( for n - l relation from @xcite ) as derived from the best fit with a free srsic index instead of the one derived from @xmath39=4 .",
    "as the relation between srsic index and host - galaxy magnitude has its own uncertainties and scatter , and as our average value is close to 4 , we adopted the simpler solution of fixing @xmath39 to 4 for all objects as our default choice .",
    "this also allows a better comparison with other agn host - galaxy studies .    to ultimately probe the potential systematics related to the choice of srsic index",
    ", we performed the same analysis as for @xmath39=4 , but this time using the best @xmath39 derived from the procedure described above ( i.e. as chosen based on the @xmath37 statistics when performing a variety of fits with @xmath39 fixed to 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) both for the intermediate - z and the local sample .",
    "the same approach was followed for the local sample of rm agns .",
    "none of the results stated in the paper change : the resulting fits , offsets , and predicted evolutionary trends remain the same within the errors . more precisely , for the evolution in @xmath0(@xmath0/@xmath1@xmath2@xmath122 ) , including selection effects",
    ", we obtain @xmath123 ( instead of @xmath124 for @xmath125 ) for the full sample with an intrinsic scatter @xmath70.7 dex at 95% cl ( 0.4@xmath60.1 dex for a uniform prior on @xmath71 ) and @xmath126 ( instead of @xmath127 for @xmath125 ) for the intermediate sample alone , adopting again the prior by @xcite .",
    "for an homogeneous treatment of all data , we performed an independent analysis of the hst archival images presented in @xcite , using the same approach as for our distant seyfert galaxies (   [ sec : surface ] ) .",
    "details of the observations can be found in @xcite .",
    "we disregarded the five objects observed with wfpc2/pc due to the low quality of the data , the psf mismatch when using a synthetic psf created by tinytim and the lack of stellar psfs on the images .",
    "these problems made it difficult to achieve satisfactory fits .",
    "the spheroid radius found with galfit was either in the lower limit of 2.5 pixels ( = fwhm of psf )  probably because it was fitting a psf mismatch  or was unphysically large .",
    "thus , we here focus on the acs / hrc data alone .    from the remaining 30 objects imaged with acs / hrc , we first excluded all ngc objects ( 8/30 ) which are nearby and extended and for which the field - of - view is too small to measure the sky background . also , they are often affected by dust lanes .",
    "the latter is also the case for ic4239a ( plus an unreliable bh mass ) .",
    "for the same reasons , these objects were also excluded in the further analysis by @xcite .",
    "we decided to additionally exclude fairall 9 due to a dust lane crossing the spheroid and pg0953 + 414 for which no reasonable fit could be achieved .",
    "thus , our final robust sample consists of 19 objects .",
    "we used the pipeline - processed data and combined them using multidrizzle , to remove cosmic rays and defects and correct for distortion .",
    "( note that multidrizzle takes into account the saturated pixels of the longer exposures and combines the images accordingly . )",
    "as the data were not dithered , no improvement of sampling was achieved and the final scale is 0.025 arcsec / pixel ( pixfrac=0.9 ) . for these acs / hrc data imaged in the f550 m filter , the psf created by tinytim is not as good a match as it is for the nicmos images .",
    "we therefore additionally created a psf from a star observed in one of the images ( mrk 110 ) and performed extensive tests to compare their quality . as the tinytim psf typically gave a bad fit in the core , but the stellar psf had too low s / n in the wings , we decided to combine both psfs ( the synthetic psf for the wings , the stellar psf in center out to @xmath128 = 2 @xmath129 fwhm ) , which significantly improved the quality of the fits .",
    "this psf enabled us to fit the agn with only one psf without the need of corrections of psf mismatch ( e.g.  by using an additional psf as done by @xcite ) .",
    "we used the same criteria as for our distant seyfert sample to decide whether we need to fit an additional disk component ( see   [ sec : surface ] ) . for four objects ,",
    "@xcite fitted both a spheroidal and disk component , while we decided that fitting a spheroidal component alone is sufficient .",
    "one object has a saturated psf ( pg1226 + 023 ) and we masked out the saturated center to fit the psf to the wings only . for three objects ( ark  120 , mrk  279 , and pg  1211 + 143 )",
    ", we out - masked the very center of the psf and fitted the psf to the wings only due to remaining psf mismatch .",
    "we compare the results in fig .",
    "[ compare ] . for this comparison , we add the different psf components and the different spheroid components of @xcite to a `` total '' psf magnitude and `` total '' spheroid magnitude , respectively .",
    "while the psf and total magnitudes generally agree well , the spheroid magnitudes we derive are often brighter than in @xcite , especially in those cases where we fit a spheroid component only and not spheroid+disk as in @xcite ( 4 objects ) .    as for our intermediate redshift sample ( see appendix  [ sec : sersic ] ) , we also calculated the best srsic index we would expect based on the measured host - galaxy magnitude using the relation in @xcite .",
    "the average value of @xmath39=5.2 @xmath6 1.6 is in agreement within the errors with the average @xmath39 derived when using the relation between srsic index and bulge b - band magnitude from @xcite",
