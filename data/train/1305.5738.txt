    "the numerical simulations of structure formation in the cosmological context has been providing us with a large wealth of interesting information about the structure of cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes . among the results from the numerical simulations two remarkable facts",
    "stands out , an universal dark matter profile ( @xcite , @xcite , and the occurrence of a power law behavior for the pseudo phase space density , @xcite , @xcite . as an example ludlow etal ( 2010 ) demonstrated that the residual to the fit of a power law to the pseudo phase space density @xmath1 is typically about 10 to 20 % and does not exceed 30 % .",
    "this behavior is observed in a range of about 2 decades .",
    "similar results were also derived by @xcite using aquarius data .",
    "the power law regime for @xmath2 has a well defined outer boundary , while the inner regime is more difficult to probe due to the intrinsic difficulty of reconstructing the complex evolution of the phase space density when the system experiences a large number of multi - dimensional folds in phase space .",
    "the agreement between the power law exponent and the prediction from the bertschinger self similar solution ( @xcite ) suggested that the cdm haloes had self similar properties .",
    "however the bertschinger solution is a purely radial solution which does not corresponds to the haloes obtained in numerical simulations .",
    "the reason for the correct prediction of @xmath2 exponent is due to the fact that bertschinger s solution belongs to a family of self similar solutions with the same specific values of the constants .",
    "the actual solution belongs to the same family but with completely different density and velocity dispersion , only the pseudo phase space density and other related quantities are the same in this family of solutions ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus bertschinger s solution should be seen in historical perspective as the first clue to suggest the self similar nature of the real solution .",
    "a puzzling unsolved problem was the reason for the observed power law behavior of the pseudo phase space density , and the non power law behavior of other quantities .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that dynamically cold self similar solutions in a quasi equilibrium situation have pseudo phase space density with power law behavior .",
    "this result derive from the fact that the smoothed probability distribution @xmath3 of @xmath4 remains self similar ( alard 2013 ) .",
    "a direct prediction is that the higher order moments constructed using @xmath3 should also be power laws with predictable exponents .",
    "these predicted power laws are effectively consistent with the measurements obtained using data from numerical simulations ( alard 2013 ) .",
    "other quantities like the smoothed density do not have a self similar expectation , and thus are not power laws near equilibrium . at this point",
    "it is important to note that these results obtained with an intrinsically cold dark matter model are incompatible with self similar models developed in the fluid limit ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite ) . the cold model is not analog to a continuous model , this fundamental difference is related to the different behavior of @xmath2 and other related quantities , and non self similar smoothed quantities like @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "thus @xmath2 and higher order moments of the probability distribution of @xmath4 are fundamental and specific in the cold non fluid approach only . as a consequence",
    "the consistency between self similarity and the near equilibrium phase space density corresponding to the collapse of dynamically cold initial fluctuation is well established .",
    "this description of pure cdm halos has to be modified to take into account the baryon population co - existing with the dm in real galaxies .",
    "the baryonic feedback modifies the mass distribution and as a result influences the dm halo through changes in the gravitational potential .",
    "this mechanism leads to a much more complex picture .",
    "a good illustration of this picture is given by the recent observations of the rotation curves of galaxies , and in particular from the things survey ( @xcite ) the high quality rotation curves from @xcite , @xcite show that the central density core slope is lower than the expectation from the nfw profile .",
    "these strong and indisputable discrepancies between the observations and the expectation from the cdm model have always been a serious problem for the cold dark matter approach .",
    "two different type of solution have been proposed to solve this issue , first cdm is not valid and must be replaced by another model , like for instance mond @xcite , @xcite . interestingly @xcite show that the things survey rotation curves are consistent with mond .",
    "the second solution is to consider that the baryonic feedback is sufficient to produce the softening of the dm density cusp , and this is the solution that will be considered here .",
    "the baryonic feedback has a particularly strong effect on the central region of the dm halo by flattening the initial density cusp . using",
    "hydro dynamical simulations @xcite show that the baryonic feedback model is consistent with the things survey data .",
    "since the baryons are coupled to the dm though gravitational interaction , the destruction of the central dm cusp is produced through rapid fluctuations of the gravitational potential due to the ejection of gas and dust .",
    "this cusp smoothing mechanism has been investigated in details by , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite who demonstrated that this mechanism is efficient and offers a possibility to reconcile cdm and the observations .",
    "the process operates through a cycle of gas ejection and re - accretion , however it is interesting to note that the re - accretion of the gas does not produce a compensation of the effects on the dm core @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a general review on the baryonic feedback model .",
    "note that the observations and the numerical simulations both suggests that central density core is not completely flat .",
    "the problem of the asymptotic slope at the origin of the central core has been studied by , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite . imposing a baryonic scale length to the dark matter",
    "halo indicates that the scaling relations are affected by the baryons in a way that may not be compatible with the initial similarity class and could result in the development new type of baryonic induced similarity .",
    "this model is supported by the results from high resolution hydro - dynamical simulations , where the baryonic feedback influence the dm halo parameters and in particular the pseudo phase space density , @xcite .",
    "the idea of an universal similarity class for the rotation curve of galaxies was already introduced by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as we shall see this new similarity class has also some relation to the mond phenomenology and provide an explanation to the scale independent accelerations observed at a typical radius for a large number of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that in the continuation we distinguish between scale independence and self similarity. in the forthcoming sections scale independence will mean independent of the distance scale ( basically the size of the galaxy ) , while self similarity will mean independent on the scale of all the variables ( distance , velocity , time , see @xcite section 3 ) .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the baryonic feedback model already existing . as an example ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) developed various models and investigations to document the effect of the baryonic feedback on the central parts of the dm halos .",
    "these works use the effects of supernovae and agn to drive the baryonic feedback .",
    "the effect of supernovae tends to be dominant for low mass galaxies ( see @xcite for more details ) , however there are several mechanisms involved in the supernovae feedback .",
    "the supernovae outflow may be driven trough `` bursty energy transfer '' @xcite , or though momentum driven wind @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the model presented here will consider the momentum driven winds as the source of baryonic feedback .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found that among 12 others models tested the momentum driven outflow model adjusted on local starburst data was the only one to reproduce the inter galactic medium enrichment data . in the momentum driven wind model",
    "the radiation from young stars impinges on dust in the outflow , which then couples to the gas and propels matter out of the galaxy .",
    "the associated outflow of baryonic matter affects the kinematics of the dark halo , with a dominant effect in the central area .",
    "this baryonic feedback leads to the suppression of the central density cusp and its replacement with a nearly constant or lower density slope central core . as a consequence",
    "the scale length of the dark matter halo @xmath7 is imposed by the baryonic processes , and should be closely related to the baryonic distribution size @xmath8 .",
    "the foundations of this model are directly derived from the observational analysis of the rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "a correlation between the gas content and the structure of the gravitational potential is observed @xcite .",
    "this analysis is reinforced by the results of @xcite and @xcite who find similar results with the additional finding that the structure of the potential is also related to the star formation activity .",
    "these observational results show that baryonic process related to stellar formation are responsible for the modification of the gravitational potential .",
    "however the detailed sequence of the events leading to these observational correlation is not clearly defined .",
    "a possibility is that most of the dm halo re - shaping occur at an early epoch when the star formation is very active , or that a number of particularly strong starburst has a major infleunce .",
    "however , the observational result from @xcite suggest that the total amount of energy released by the stellar formation is the real and fundamental parameter . it is important to note that the detailed sequence of the events do not really matter as long as the global process remain self similar .    actually the dark matter core size @xmath7 is constructed by a dominant baryonic process",
    "@xmath9 which has a typical scale length @xmath8 , basically @xmath10 . the width at half maximum @xmath11 of @xmath9 reads , @xmath12 .",
    "thus @xmath13 , with a constant of proportionality @xmath14 depending on the specific functional form for @xmath9 .",
    "note that if we had estimated the typical scale length of the process @xmath9 not by taking the width at half maximum , but by taking the width at any other fractional value , it would change the value of @xmath14 but we would still have , @xmath15 .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found that the baryonic and dark matter scale length are nearly proportional .",
    "similarly a correlation between the rotation curve and the baryonic distribution is also reported by @xcite .",
    "the strength of the baryonic influence on the dark matter kinematics must be compared to the gravitational force due to dark matter .",
    "if the baryonic force dominates we are in a pure flat core regime , while in the case where the dark matter force dominates we return to the nfw profile ( navarro , frenk , & white , 1997 ) .",
    "the intermediate regime when the dark matter force @xmath16 and baryonic force @xmath17 are of the same order defines the typical size of the baryonic core induced regime . the force is proportional to the acceleration thus the dark matter core size @xmath7 corresponds to the following condition : @xmath18 assuming a burkert profile for the dark matter ( @xcite ) , gentile _ etal _ ( 2009 ) found that at a burkert profile scale length @xmath19 the respective dark matter and baryonic acceleration are : @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the radius corresponding to a half of the central value for the burkert profile is @xmath22 . assuming that most of the baryon mass is inside @xmath7 , the baryons in the range @xmath23 behave like a point mass , the acceleration at @xmath19 must be re - normalized by the scale factor @xmath24 ^ 2 $ ] to obtain the acceleration at @xmath7 . on the other hand",
    "the acceleration due to the burkert acceleration decrease by about @xmath25 .",
    "these corrections implies that @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these values of the acceleration are consistent with eq .",
    "[ acc_eq ] within the errors bars .",
    "this result shows that the scale length of the dark matter halo core radius is consistent with the strength of the baryonic influence .",
    "the radial distance scale of dark matter is imposed by the baryons , which in itself is not sufficient to impose another similarity class to the dark matter halo .",
    "however as we shall see an equilibrium condition for the gas also implies a constraint on the total force at the distance scale , which is only compatible with a specific similarity class .",
    "we consider the effect of the baryonic feedback on a galaxy composed of stellar populations gas and dark matter .",
    "the momentum driven winds offer an efficient mechanism to drive winds other large distances .",
    "a potential problem in this model is that the gas and dust are ejected from the galaxy and sent to the intergalactic medium .",
    "however to have an effect on the dm halo there must be a cycle where matter is ejected and fall back on the galaxy .",
    "but contrary to conventional wisdom @xcite show that a cycle occur in the momentum driven wind model , the ejected material is far more likely to fall back rather than stay in the inter galactic medium , with a typical fall back time of 1 gyr .",
    "note that the critical opacity ( optically thick limit ) is reached very quickly in a galaxy due to the production of dust by supernovae .",
    "@xcite shows that the critical opacity is reached in only @xmath28 years for a major starburst . as a consequence we will work in the optically thick limit where the equivalent starburst luminosity @xmath29 of the stellar population is entirely absorbed by the gas .",
    "the mass distribution @xmath30 is assumed to be spherically symmetric .",
    "murray , quataert , & thompson ( 2005 ) proposed that such systems are prone to reach a critical luminosity @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 ( which in general is expected ) the acceleration of the gas layer is positive and the system loses mass which in turns decrease the star - burst activity .",
    "this mechanism operates until the star - burst luminosity reach the critical limit @xmath33 .",
    "the luminosity @xmath33 corresponds to an equilibrium between the momentum deposition of the radiation in the gas and the gravitational force applied to the gas .",
    "murray , quataert , & thompson ( 2005 ) studied this equilibrium for a gas component distributed in a shell . in this case",
    "the gas shell diameter is supposed to be close to the typical size of the galaxy @xmath8 , which is proportional to the dark matter core size @xmath7 . considering a total mass of gas @xmath34",
    "the equation corresponding to the equilibrium condition reads : @xmath35 the starburst luminosity is associated with young stars , and the kinematics of these stars is not much different from the kinematics of the cold molecular gas , thus the mass loss affecting this population of stars will be proportional to the mass loss of the cold molecular gas . since we expect that the rate of new stars will be also proportional to the cold molecular gas mass , the total number of stars in the starburst population will be proportional to the cold molecular gas mass .",
    "high quality observations by @xcite , demonstrate that the fraction of cold molecular gas was much higher at the epoch of galaxy formation than what it is today . on average the fraction of molecular gas is at about 40 % when galaxies are forming , which is quite uncommon at the present time .",
    "the variability of the molecular gas fraction is also smaller at the epoch of galaxy formation , which justifies the approximation that the total gas mass and the cold molecular gas mass are proportional .",
    "the starburst population goes like the cold molecular gas and that the cold molecular gas mass is approximately proportional to the gas mass in forming galaxies .",
    "thus we consider that the amount of stars in the starburst population will be approximately proportional to the total gas mass , which corresponds to the following relation : @xmath36 by combining eqs ( [ gas_eq_ring ] ) and ( [ ml_eq ] ) we obtain the following equation : @xmath37      in the general case , assuming a density distribution @xmath38 of the gas , the equilibrium at @xmath39 condition reads : @xmath40 applying again eq . [ ml_eq ] we obtain : @xmath41 in case of a stable equilibrium , the total force must be null at the point of equilibrium but also its first derivative . if we assume that an equilibrium is effectively realized at a typical baryonic scale @xmath8 , we have : @xmath42      eq . ( [ gas_eq_gen2 ] ) implies that the mass scales like the square of the radius of the distribution which is not consistent with the bertschinger self similarity class .",
    "the nature of the baryonic scaling implies that @xmath43 , adopting @xmath44 , using eq .",
    "( [ gas_eq_gen2 ] ) and defining a scale free acceleration , @xmath45 , we have , @xmath46 .",
    "thus the acceleration is constant at a fixed point in re - scaled coordinates .",
    "the self similar regime associated with this constant acceleration corresponds to a specific scaling of the distance and velocity variables .",
    "the development of a new self similar regime induced by conditions developing near the center of the distribution remind us of the of the situation observed for the binney conjecture ( @xcite ) . in the two dimensional phase space",
    "the binney conjecture states that for a large variety of initial conditions the system converges to a power law with an exponent equal to @xmath47 .",
    "it was demonstrated by alard ( 2013 ) that the power law is induced by a singularity developing at the center of the system . note that since the scale length of the dark matter self similar solution is time dependent , the scale length of the baryonic distribution must be also time dependent .",
    "however we consider a near equilibrium situation where the temporal variation of the baryonic scale radius is small compared to the system typical time scale , thus the baryonic and dark matter scale length need only to be asymptotically identical .",
    "it is expected that the variation of the baryonic scale length is due to the slow accretion of new baryonic material .",
    "before we relate the baryonic scaling obtained in the previous section to a given similarity , let first remind some of the results obtained in alard ( 2013 ) on the self similar solutions of the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "given a phase space density @xmath48 the general solution in six dimensional phase space reads : @xmath49 eq .",
    "( [ self_eq ] ) implies that the density @xmath50 has the following time scaling : @xmath51 consequently the time scaling of the acceleration reads : @xmath52 the self similar growth of a given dark matter halo with the constraint from eq .",

    "thus the new similarity class corresponds to @xmath56 , this must be compared to the initial bertschinger similarity class , where the similarity was imposed by the nature of the cosmological infall and corresponds to , @xmath57 .",
    "the halo velocity and distance scales are related to a free parameter @xmath58 in the definition of time for the self similar solution .",
    "basically if @xmath48 is a solution then @xmath59 is also a solution . by introducing @xmath58 the scaling of @xmath60 and @xmath61",

    "the corresponding re - scalings of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are @xmath64 and @xmath65 . for",
    "the final stage of the evolution of an individual halo @xmath66 does not depend on time , which also implies that @xmath66 does not depend on @xmath58 , and thus does not depend on @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "these results illustrates the correspondence between time and scale independence .",
    "equation ( [ gas_eq_gen2 ] ) implies that the total acceleration at @xmath8 is scale free and since @xmath66 is scale free at all positions , the baryonic acceleration at @xmath8 , @xmath69 is scale free or time independent . the baryonic acceleration at larger distances , out of the baryonic distribution is properly approximated with the acceleration due to a single massive point , thus , @xmath70 eq .",
    "( [ a0beq ] ) indicates that at larger distances @xmath71 is only a function of scale free variables and as a consequence is scale free . since @xmath66 is also scale free the total acceleration at larger distances ( @xmath72 )",
    "is scale free .",
    "the fact that the both the baryonic and dark matter accelerations are independent of scale is supported by the observations .",
    "gentile ( 2009 ) found that at a specific scale length @xmath19 ( @xmath73 ) , the baryonic and dark matter acceleration are constant .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite , developed an empirical modification of newtonian dynamics in order to reproduce the rotation curves of galaxies without the need of including a dark unseen component .",
    "the remarkable success of this approach in reproducing the data ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is particularly compelling since the modelisation is based on parameters reconstructed directly from the distribution of visible matter .",
    "mond assumes that a transition from the newtonian regime occurs at an acceleration @xmath74 and that below this acceleration we observe an evolution to the deep mond regime which represents the very low acceleration limit . between the newtonian and deep mond regime an empirical interpolation function",
    "is assumed .",
    "there are various models for the interpolation function with the obvious consequence that this intermediate regime is not a very well defined feature of mond .",
    "the essential feature are clearly the acceleration scale at which the transition occurs and the properties of the deep mond regime at very low accelerations .",
    "these two features derived from mond are clearly related to universal properties of galaxies and have to be reproduced by any theory aiming to represent the mass distribution in galaxies . as we will see the baryonic induced self similar model is consistent with these mond features .",
    "let s now review mond general properties and confront them with the self similar model .",
    "for spherically symmetric systems the new equation reads : @xmath75      @xcite already noticed that a similarity relation existed in the mond approach and that eq . [ milgrom_eq ] can be written in a dimensionless form ( see milgrom 1986 , eq .",

    "the main concept presented in this article is that the initial dark matter self similarity is affected by the baryon feedback and replaced with a baryonic induced self similarity .",
    "it was demonstrated in sec .",
    "( [ section_2 ] ) that the baryonic feedback impose two conditions on the dark matter distribution .",
    "these baryonic constraints are not compatible with the initial similarity class .",
    "provided that the solution remains self similar , the conditions from sec .",
    "( [ section_2 ] ) imply the emergence of a new similarity class for the dark matter halo .",
    "an important point is that this model relies on the assumption that an equilibrium is obtained between the wind pressure and the gravity of the system , leading to a baryonic induced similarity of the dm halo .",
    "however to reach this equilibrium the equivalent luminosity @xmath147 must be greater than some critical luminosity @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "obviously if the star formation in the galaxy is not sufficient to reach this critical luminosity , no universal acceleration would exists and the associated self similarity class would not be present . in this case",
    "it is not even clear that any self similar properties would emerge from the baryonic feedback .",
    "but we must keep in mind that violating the equilibrium condition would definitely go against the observations , and the universal accelerations for the galaxies observed by @xcite .",
    "this would also again go against the general mond conjecture @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another crucial assumption is the proportionality between the luminosity and the mass of gas ( see [ section_2 ] , eq .",
    "[ ml_eq ] ) .",
    "an open possibility is that the scale factor between mass and luminosity in eq .",
    "[ ml_eq ] depends on galaxy type . as a result",
    "we would still have a baryonic induced self similarity for each galaxy , but the similarity parameter ( the constant in eq .",
    "[ gas_eq_ring2 ] ) , which is an acceleration would depend on galaxy type .",
    "interestingly @xcite found that the acceleration constant estimated by @xcite is correlated to the mass of the galaxy , which would support the fact that the scaling in eq .",
    "[ ml_eq ] depends on galaxy type .",
    "a direct consequence of this finding is also to support the fact that the nearly universal relations observed for galaxies are due to internal physics within the galaxies , a category to which the baryonic feedback obviously belongs .",
    "a final and crucial assumption is that the effect of the baryonic feedback is sufficient to induce a new class of similarity in the dm halo .",
    "it is reasonable to consider that the baryonic feedback is sufficient to alter the shape of the dm core and that this process has self similar properties . but does this means that this baryonic self similarity is transmitted to the whole dm halo ?",
    "it is clear that at least self similarity should be transmitted in some domain with boundaries scaling like the typical of the scale of the baryonic distribution .",
    "however , does this means that the baryonic self similarity will be transmitted to the very central region , does self similarity breaks at some small fraction of the baryonic scale",
    "? we should also expect that self similarity breaks at some distance in the outer regions . at the moment",
    "the answer to these questions is not clear , but hopefully some new insight should come from the detailed exploration of this type of model using numerical simulations .",
    "a possible observational test of self similarity is provided in sec .",
    "[ section_5 ] , with the prediction of an einasto profile with index @xmath146 .",
    "however the reconstruction of the parameters of an einasto profile is especially difficult do to the intrinsic difficulty of subtracting the baryon contribution in the inner region ( @xcite ) .",
    "one important property of this new self similar solution is that the acceleration generated by the dark matter halo is scale free .",
    "when combined with the properties of the baryonic feedback , the scale free acceleration of the dark matter implies that the baryon acceleration at one scale radius @xmath7 is independent on @xmath7 .",
    "this self similar model put a number of observational facts on galaxies in a coherent framework .",
    "first , the universality of the baryon and dark matter accelerations observed at a scale radius of the dark matter distribution for a large number of galaxies ( gentile _ etal _ 2009 ) , and second this self similar model is related to the mond phenomenology of galaxies ( milgrom 1983 , and bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) .",
    "an additional point is that the density corresponding to this self similar model is expected to form a flat cored distribution in the central region , and a large variety of profiles has been proposed to fit the observations , cored isothermal , burkert , or einasto profiles . among these possibilities , the einasto profile has the best compatibility near the origin with the expectation from the self similar , baryonic induced model . in these results",
    "it is of particular interest to point out that the in self similar model cdm and mond become consistent with each other .",
    "the general features observed in the rotation curves of galaxies are properly described in the mond framework , but we see that it can be as well represented by dark matter self similar solution .    the incompatibility of the mond phenomenology and of the observations in general is a serious problem for the cold dark matter model ( see for instance @xcite for a review ) .",
    "thus the result that this new cold dark matter model based on self similarity is consistent with the observed phenomenology is definitely a change in the cdm paradigm .",
    "a major difference between the mond approach and the self similar cdm model is that the self similar model does not apply to clusters of galaxies , since the equilibrium condition ( eq .",
    "[ gas_eq_gen2 ] ) does not apply to a cluster .",
    "the discrepancies between the mond phenomenology and the observations of the bullet cluster are thus predicted by the self similar model .",
