    "linear polymers in disordered media have been an important topic for experimental and theoretical study for more than 20 years  @xcite .",
    "it is a well known fact that that the universal scaling properties of linear polymers in strongly disordered media are well described by the statistics of self - avoiding - walks ( saws ) on percolation clusters .",
    "usually , the term saw implicitly refers to a mean or average saw for which an average is taken over the number of steps or intrinsic lengths of all self - avoiding walks with a specified eukledian start - to - end distance or , respectively , over the start - to - end distances of all self - avoiding walks with a specified intrinsic length . however , there are other saws that are equally interesting .",
    "most notably , there is the shortest and longest saw for which the intrinsic length for given terminal - separation is shortest and longest , respectively . on critical percolation clusters ,",
    "all these saws are fractals , i.e. , their masses ( which are proportional to their intrinsic lengths , of course ) as functions of the start - to - end distance scale with non - integer scaling exponents .",
    "interestingly , however , it turns out that the mean saw is more than just a simple fractal ",
    "it is a multifractal . on critical percolation clusters ,",
    "the statistical weights of the elementary constituents ( bonds or sites ) are non - trivial , and an entire family of multifractal scaling exponents is required to characterize the distribution of these weights through its moments .",
    "although the last 2 decades have brought great advancement in the understanding of linear polymers in disordered media , there are certain problems that have caused enduring controversy .",
    "for example it turned out that the famous meir - harris ( mh ) model @xcite which has long been standing as the only existing field theoretic model for studying average saws on percolation clusters has trouble with renormalizability @xcite .",
    "another example is the puzzling fact that sophisticated numerical simulations by various groups have produced widespread results for the scaling exponent @xmath0 describing the mean length of the average saw , see  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we highlight that one has to be careful about the notion of average saw if the disorder of the underlying medium is strong .",
    "namely , there are essentially two qualitatively different ways of averaging over all saws between two connected sites for a given random configuration of a diluted lattice , one being static and the other being kinetic .",
    "it is well known that the exponent @xmath1 in a non - random medium is the same for static and kinetic averaging  @xcite , and that weak disorder of the medium in redundant in the sense of the renormalization group ( rg ) if static averaging is used @xcite .",
    "below , we employ dynamical field theory to demonstrate that the same holds true for kinetic averaging . to discuss the effects of strong disorder",
    ", we present a renormalizable field theory for saws on percolation clusters based on the random resistor network ( rrn ) .",
    "we use this theory to calculate the scaling exponents of the shortest , the longest and the average saw as well as the entire family of multifractal exponents for saws on percolation clusters .",
    "this theory demonstrates that kinetic and static averaging may lead to very different results if the random medium is at the percolation point . within the real - world interpretation of feynman - diagrams ,",
    "static averaging leads to non - renormalizability , and hence we argue that the statistics of linear polymers in disordered media may not have anasymptotic scaling limit , when static averaging is used . because the static average has been used in many simulations , this might explain why the numerical results for @xmath0 are so wide spread .",
    "in fact , recent simulations by blavatska and janke  @xcite using kinetic averaging are in excellent agreement with our theoretical results . to further corroborate our findings and to shed some light on them from a different angle , we include a discussion of the mh model in the context of kinetic _",
    "vs_.  static averaging .",
    "a brief account of the work presented here has been given previously in ref .",
    "the fundamental question addressed in this paper is that of the scaling behavior the length of a ( shortest , longest or mean ) saw on a percolation cluster when averaged over all cluster conformation . to this end",
    ", one can either consider the scaling of the mean euclidian distance @xmath2 between the starting point and a random endpoint of an saw of length @xmath3 , @xmath4 or one can study averages over the random length @xmath5 of a saw ( which is proportional to the number of monomers , the intrinsic length or the mass of the corresponding polymer ) between a pair of sites @xmath6 as a function of their euklidian distance @xmath7 .",
    "the latter approach is more convenient from the standpoint of field theory  @xcite , and we will take it here .",
    "let @xmath8 be the pair connectedness indicator function which is unity if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are connected in the given random configuration @xmath11 and zero otherwise .",
    "let @xmath12 be the generating function of the saws @xmath13 with length @xmath14 belonging to the bundle @xmath15 of all saws starting at @xmath10 and ending at @xmath9 both on cluster @xmath16 .",
    "this generating function can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a weight function that depends on the averaging procedure one uses and which , of course , has to satisfy @xmath19 .",
    "special cases are @xmath20 if @xmath21 is either the shortest or the longest saw belonging to the bundle @xmath15 . the perhaps most basic averaging procedures are either static , i.e. , all the @xmath22 @xmath13 s belonging to @xmath15 are weighted equally , @xmath23 , or kinetic , i.e. , a given @xmath13 earns a factor @xmath24 contributing to @xmath18 at each ramification where @xmath25 other saws from the bundle @xmath26 split off and which , in general , leads to different weights for different @xmath13s.note that in kinetic averaging , the probabilities satisfy the additivity property @xmath27 when two saws @xmath28 and @xmath29 are identified , e.g. , in a coarse - graining procedure . to the contrary , this is not the case in static averaging because the number @xmath22 changes when saws are identified , and this fact leads to trouble when coarse - graining procedures are applied spatial inhomogeneous fractals like the backbone of a percolation cluster as they are in renormalized field theory .    in terms of the generating function ,",
    "the mean length of the saws is given by @xmath30_{p}=-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}\\frac{\\bigl[\\chi(x , y)\\ln z(w;x , y,\\mathfrak{c})\\bigr]_{p}}{\\bigl[\\chi(x , y)\\bigr]_{p } } \\ , , \\label{mean - length}\\ ] ] where @xmath31_{p}$ ] denotes an average over the configurations @xmath11 in which each bond is occupied with probability @xmath32 . at criticality",
    ", one expects scaling behavior of the mean length @xmath33 of long polymer chains , @xmath34_{p}\\right\\vert _ { w = w_{c}}\\sim\\left\\vert \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}\\right\\vert ^{1/\\nu_{saw}}\\,.\\label{length - scal}\\ ] ] for kinetic averaging , in particular , the critical value @xmath35 of @xmath36 is zero .",
    "it is well known that multifractality can arise when physical processes unfold on fractals such as critical percolation clusters .",
    "typical examples are electrical conduction on rrns  @xcite and random resistor diode networks  @xcite where the distribution of currents flowing through the bonds is multifractal , i.e. , is characterized by an infinite set of critical exponents which are not related in a simple linear or affine fashion .",
    "it turns out that the situation is similar for saws on percolation clusters , where the moments @xmath37 with @xmath38 the length of bond @xmath39 and @xmath40 the statistical weight of bond @xmath39 with @xmath41 if @xmath39 belongs to the saw @xmath13 and @xmath42 if it does not , probe distinct substructures of the underlying percolation cluster and hence the average @xmath43_{p}}{\\bigl[\\chi(x , y)\\bigr]_{p } } \\label{mdef}\\ ] ] leads to an infinite family of multifractal exponents @xmath44 : @xmath45 one has the special cases @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the fractal dimension of the backbone , @xmath50 is the fractal dimension of the red ( simply connecting ) bonds , and @xmath51 is the percolation correlation length exponent .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the effects that weak disorder of the underlying medium has on the statistics of saws . for static averaging over saw conformations ,",
    "it well known that this disorder is redundant in the sense of the rg , i.e. , it affects only non - universal quantities ( in annealed as well as in quenched disorder - averages ) although a nave application of the harris criterion  @xcite apparently signals its relevance .",
    "this redundancy can be shown by introducing non - correlated quenched disorder into the usual @xmath52-field theory of a @xmath53-component order parameter which , when the replica trick with @xmath54-fold replication is used to facilitate averaging over the quenched disorder , generates the statistics of saws with static averaging via the limits @xmath55 and @xmath56 . here",
    ", we are interested mainly in kinetic averaging , and hence it is of some interest to demonstrate that this redundancy also holds for this type of averaging .",
    "a field theory for kinetically generated saws in ordered media has been formulated by peliti more than twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "here , we introduce a dynamical field theoretic model for kinetically generated saws in disordered media , and we utilize this model to discuss the effects of weak disorder . to set the stage , we first introduce reaction diffusion processes that model saws in disordered media as a kinetic process and then we jump to the dynamical response functional for these processes . additional background and some details of its derivation using the creation - destruction operator formalism are given in appendix  [ app : dynamicalfunctionalforsaw ] .",
    "it should not go un - noted that this description of saws in disordered media as a kinetic process completely avoids using the replica trick as well as the zero - component - limit and hence all the potential difficulties associated with these limits .    on a very basic and intuitive level ,",
    "kinetic saws in disordered media can be described by a set of simple diffusion and reaction processes . as in the problem of brownian",
    "walks , the walkers hop on a @xmath57-dimensional cubic lattice from a site @xmath58 to a neighboring one @xmath59 .",
    "this is described by a random process @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes a random walker at @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the hopping rate .",
    "self - avoidance is introduced by production of markers @xmath64 at @xmath62 , and destruction of the walkers by interaction with a marker    [ react ] @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are reaction rates . in addition to these processes ,",
    "there is quenched disorder modelled by static traps @xmath68 with a random distribution @xmath69 , and this disorder acts on the walkers via a destruction process with rate @xmath13 @xmath70 due to the markers and the traps , walkers living at time @xmath71 should avoid sites that they have visited at times @xmath72 as well as sites which are locations of traps .",
    "these diffusion and reaction processes can be condensed into a field theoretic functional following the work of peliti .",
    "a series of steps which are sketched in the appendix leads to the dynamical response functional @xmath73s \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{g}{2}\\big[\\lambda\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dt\\,\\tilde{s}s\\big]^{2}\\biggr\\}\\,.\\label{saw - j}\\ ] ] @xmath74 is a field that has its origin in the variable @xmath75 and encodes the random position @xmath76 of a walker at time @xmath71 according to the above reactions .",
    "its mean value is the probability density finding a walker at these coordinates .",
    "@xmath77 is the corresponding response field that creates a walker at position @xmath76 at time @xmath71 .",
    "the dynamical response functional is invariant under the duality transformation @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath63 is the usual kinetic coefficient .",
    "the dependence of @xmath79 on the disorder is hidden in the parameter @xmath80 and in the coupling constant @xmath81 .",
    "the latter consists of two parts : a positive part stemming from the self - avoidance and an additional negative part stemming from the disorder .",
    "note that the fact that disorder and self - avoidance generate the same type of coupling in the field - theoretic functional makes the harris criterion inapplicable for the problem at hand .",
    "analyzing the rg flow , it turns out that the fixed point value of @xmath81 which corresponds to the limit of asymptotically large saws is independent of the nonuniversal value of @xmath81 and hence of the disorder fluctuations . because we are mainly interested in this limit",
    ", we can assume that the sole remaining disorder - dependence rests in @xmath80 .",
    "however , we can eliminate @xmath80 from the dynamical response functional by letting @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this implies that the disorder - averaged greens functions  the probability densities for finding @xmath84 walkers at positions @xmath85 at times @xmath86 if they are created at positions @xmath87 at times @xmath88 , respectively  @xmath89 where @xmath90 denotes the cumulants with respect to the boltzmann weight @xmath91 and @xmath92 denotes disorder averaging , are of the form @xmath93 where the index @xmath94 indicates the greens functions without any disorder .",
    "the differences @xmath95 are proportional to the lengths of the corresponding saws , and hence , the exponential factors correspond to a change in the non - universal fugacities in the statistics of the saws .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ relationdisnondis ] ) reveals that all universal properties remain unaffected by disorder .",
    "this establishes that the universal properties of kinetically generated and averaged saws are independent of weak disorder as their statically averaged counterparts are  @xcite .",
    "the rrn is a variant of the usual percolation problem where occupied bonds are viewed as resistors and open bonds are viewed as insulators . here , we consider a nonlinear generalization nrrn of the rrn for which it is well known that the total resistance between 2 points becomes proportional to the length of the shortest and longest saw between those 2 points , respectively , for specific limits of the nonlinearity . in previous work  @xcite , we have shown that the feynman diagrams for rrns ( including their nonlinear generalization ) have a real - world interpretation , i.e. , they can be considered as being resistor networks themselves .",
    "based on this real - world interpretation , we here develop an intuitive and powerful field - theoretic method to calculate the mean length and multifractal moments of saws on percolation clusters .    to be specific , we consider a @xmath57-dimensional lattice where each bond is randomly occupied with probability @xmath32 by a conductor or empty with probability @xmath96 .",
    "at each lattice side @xmath97 there is a voltage @xmath98 .",
    "the voltage drop at a bond @xmath99 between sites @xmath97 and @xmath100 obeys a generalized ohm s law  @xcite @xmath101 with a bond resistance @xmath102 .",
    "equivalently , with @xmath103 the current @xmath104 across the bond is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the non - linear conductance of the bond .",
    "we restrict ourselves in the following to the case that all occupied bonds have identical elementary conductances @xmath107 , and the conductances of the unoccupied bonds are zero .",
    "the currents are conserved at each site and obey kirchhoff s first law @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an external current @xmath109 flowing into site @xmath97 .",
    "if there are only two ports @xmath9 and @xmath10 , these currents are given by @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the current resulting from the voltage difference @xmath112 between the two ports .",
    "the electrical power @xmath113 dissipated in the network is given by the bilinear form @xmath114 where the two last equalities follow from ohm s law , eqs .",
    "( [ ohm - v ] ) and ( [ ohm - i ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ kirchhoff_1 ] ) , one has @xmath115 in the two - port case , where @xmath116 denotes the total resistance of the network between the two ports .",
    "et al_.  @xcite have shown that the special values @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 describe physically relevant geometric properties of the diluted lattice .",
    "in particular , it is easily demonstrated that for @xmath123 the internal currents at each ramification flow only in the direction of the highest ( @xmath124 ) or the lowest ( @xmath125 ) voltage gradient ( electromotorical force ) thereby mapping out the shortest or the longest saw between the 2 terminals , respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "the resistance @xmath116 is proportional to the length of shortest or longest saw between @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath126 or @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "we will use this fact for calculating the average length @xmath127 for these saws via calculating the total nonlinear resistance @xmath116 averaged subject to the condition , that the two ports are on the same cluster , @xmath128_{p}/\\bigl[\\chi(x , y)\\bigr]_{p}\\ , .",
    "\\label{masse_r}\\ ] ] at criticality , the average total nonlinear resistance obeys the power law @xmath129 which will allow us to extract the saw exponents for the shortest and the longest saw simply by taking the appropriate limit with respect to @xmath130 .",
    "as far as the average saw is concerned , the situation is somewhat more subtle .",
    "obviously , the average length of the average saw lies in between the average length of the shortest and the longest saw , which are , of course , very different .",
    "since average saw sits somewhere in this discontinuity at @xmath131 , it is not known how to extract its average length from the nrrn by a limit taking . to overcome this problem",
    ", we developed the idea to study the average saw by using the real - world interpretation  @xcite of feynman diagrams which we will discuss in detail in the following section .",
    "for studying saws on percolation clusters , we extend the real - world interpretation originally developed for studying electrical transport on rrns in that we put saws on feynman diagrams .",
    "as we will explain in detail below , the task of calculating the average length of saws on percolation clusters then in essence reduces to calculating the average length of saws on feynman diagrams . for the average saw in particular",
    ", this approach avoids the aforementioned problems associated with taking a limit in @xmath130    the resistance @xmath116 can be obtained by solving the circuit equations ( [ ohm - i ] ) , ( [ ohm - v ] ) , and ( [ kirchhoff_1 ] ) .",

    "( [ power_i , v ] ) , one can express the electrical power @xmath113 entirely as a function of the external current @xmath111 and the set of loop currents @xmath134 .",
    "then , one readily obtains kirchhoff s second law as a consequence of the second variational principle @xmath135 this equation is used in the following to determine the loop currents as linear functions of the external current @xmath111 . for @xmath136 , the variation principle ( [ varprinc2 ] )",
    "has a unique solution which corresponds , of course , to the global minimum of the power @xmath113 . without ambiguity",
    ", this solution leads to @xmath137 where @xmath138 denotes the length of the shortest saw ( the chemical length ) . for @xmath139 ,",
    "the situation is less straightforward .",
    "there exist in general several solutions which are all local maxima of the power @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "only if one selects the solution corresponding to the global maximum of @xmath113 , one gets the length of the longest saw via @xmath140 . as mentioned above , the average length of the average saws has to lie somewhere in the interval between these two extremal values and for a correct interpretation of @xmath141 , it seems natural to demand that it produces the length of the average saw , @xmath142 .",
    "a field theory for the non - linear random network was set up by harris @xcite in analogy to the field theory of the linear case @xcite .",
    "the network is replicated @xmath143 fold : @xmath144 .",

    "physically , these weights correspond to grounding all sites via unit capacitors . in this picture ,",
    "@xmath152 with @xmath153 corresponds to the frequency of the voltages .",
    "because the electrical power depends only on voltage differences , the integration over the mean voltage of each independent cluster of connected conductors leads to current conservation for this cluster in the limit @xmath154 .",
    "it follows that @xmath155 if the ports @xmath9 and @xmath10 are connected .",
    "however in the case that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are not connected , there arise factors @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is some positive constant , which go to zero in the limit @xmath158 . here",
    ", the condition @xmath159 is essential .",
    "then , as the result of this integration , the pair connectedness indicator function of the two ports @xmath8 is automatically generated along with other factors which go to one in the limit @xmath160 . following the work of harris @xcite , the integration over the voltage differences can now be done by the saddle - point approximation if we chose @xmath161 with @xmath162 under the conditions @xmath163 and @xmath164 which indeed can be satisfied simultaneously in the replica limit @xmath160 .",
    "note that the saddle - point equations are identical with the variation principle stated in eq .",
    "( [ varprinc1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the saddle - point is determined by the solution of the circuit equations ( [ ohm - v ] ) , ( [ ohm - i ] ) , and ( [ kirchhoff_1 ] ) , and according to eqs .
