    "the linear response theory , whose key ingredient is the lindhard function ( lf ) , is usually formulated in many - body frameworks like rpa , landau quasi - particle theory and the like ( see , _",

    "noteworthy , these simple approaches are often able to describe successfully a quite involved physics .",
    "the lf  @xcite , as originally defined , is just the particle - hole polarisation propagator for a non - relativistic free fermi gas ( ffg ) of electrons , and reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the green s function of the free electron .",

    "the analytic extension when the arguments of the logarithms become negative is prescribed to be @xmath5 and the imaginary part of the lf , namely the response to a scalar(-isoscalar ) probe , is thus obtained .",
    "actually many calculations of a fermionic relativistic response function are available  and hence a number of relativistic many - body computations have been performed .",
    "still the need of analytic expressions for the relativistic generalisation of the lf , as an useful input for a variety of calculations , is felt : indeed the results presently available ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite , which completes a previous result  @xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite ) mostly refer to the electroweak case .",
    "however we are also interested to the relativistic response to pions and @xmath6-mesons , which lead to different generalisations of the lf .",
    "further , the excitation of nucleonic resonances need to be accounted for and , last but not least , in the quark - gluon plasma the case of massless particles ( or one massive  an @xmath7 or a @xmath8 quark  and one massless ) deserves some attention .    in this paper",
    "we address a number of the above cases , showing that they can be handled algebraically in terms of only a few explicit functions .",
    "the scope we pursue is to provide , as a hopefully useful tool for people involved in the field , a rather comprehensive description of the generalised lf in the relativistic case for nucleons and for 1/2 and 3/2 spin resonances .",
    "the limiting case quoted above will also be examined in detail .",
    "the channel dependence of the ffg polarisation propagator in a relativistic framework is more pronounced than in the non - relativistic case .",
    "we start with the generalised lf for a non interacting nucleonic system @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the nucleon [ electron , quark ... ] propagator in the medium , with @xmath11 the indices @xmath12 and @xmath13 label the incoming and outgoing channel ( not necessarily coincident ) and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are some combinations of @xmath16 matrices and momenta embodying the vertices characterising the channels .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 is the analogous of @xmath18 in the vacuum .",

    "the vacuum subtraction is sufficient  @xcite .",

    "the frequency integration in then reduces to the evaluation of the residua in the ( say ) lower half - plane , because along the half - circle at infinity the @xmath28 in the denominators become irrelevant and the integrand vanishes .",
    "thus the regularised @xmath21 is given by @xmath29 ( note that the term in the last line is never singular ) .",
    "now in each denominator the factor @xmath28 can be replaced by @xmath30 .",
    "in fact the denominators in the first and third term can only vanish when @xmath31 so here the replacement @xmath32 is immaterial , while the second and fourth ones can vanish for @xmath33 so that the term @xmath34 plays the same role of @xmath35 .",
    "since , as we shall see , the explicit form of @xmath36 is inessential for the following discussion , we consider the case @xmath37 .",
    "then , with some manipulations of the @xmath38 functions and a change of variable , eq",
    ".   simplifies to @xmath39 eq .",

    "in this section we set up the general structure of the relativistic lfs , which will be later evaluated in some specific cases .    before presenting the detailed calculation",
    ", we observe that the lorentz covariance is broken by the presence of an infinite medium like the ffg , since this naturally selects a privileged frame of reference , namely the one in which the ffg is at rest .",
    "indeed in this system the nuclear matter has zero momentum , while any boost , no matter how small the velocity is , generates a state with infinite momentum .    if we instead consider a system with mass @xmath43 and finite momentum @xmath51 , then any response function @xmath52 to a probe carrying a four - momentum @xmath53 can only depend upon lorentz scalars , namely @xmath54 ; however in the @xmath55 limit @xmath56 , so that the lorentz covariance is broken since @xmath52 will depend upon @xmath41 and @xmath57 _",

    "each term of this polynomial generates contributions to @xmath40 with the same imaginary part ( up to trivial coefficients ) , but with different asymptotic behaviour , so that the evaluation of the real part will require subtracted dispersion relations .",
