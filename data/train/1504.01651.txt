    "the synthesis of elements heavier than iron proceeds via different processes .",
    "the so - called @xmath6 and @xmath7 processes involve neutron capture reactions .",
    "the @xmath6 process is the slow neutron capture process responsible for the production of stable isotopes along the valley of beta stability in the chart of isotopes .",
    "the @xmath7 process is the rapid neutron capture process and approximately half of the heavy elements with mass number @xmath8 and all the actinides in the solar system are believed to have been produced by the @xmath7 process .",
    "these two processes were found to be unable , however , to create 35 neutron - deficient , natural isotopes between @xmath9se and @xmath10hg , which were called `` @xmath0 nuclei '' or `` excluded isotopes '' @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown , on the other hand , that @xmath11er,@xmath12gd and @xmath13ta may have large @xmath6-process contributions , nevertheless , and that the @xmath14-process may contribute to @xmath15la and @xmath13ta ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath0 nuclei are thought to be produced in the @xmath2-process which includes combination of ( @xmath2,n ) , ( @xmath2,p ) and ( @xmath2,@xmath1 ) reactions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis is modeled by using an extended nuclear reaction network , for which  among others ",
    "reaction rate information of thousands of neutron , proton and @xmath1-induced reactions as well as their inverse reactions are needed @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of reactions important in this context have been performed in recent years @xcite but despite this effort , experimental cross sections are still very scarce at astrophysically interesting , low energies .",
    "the full list of the experiments can be found in the kadonis @xmath0-process database @xcite .",
    "the experiments performed so far have shown that there can be considerable differences between theoretical and experimental cross sections in some cases at energies close around the coulomb barrier . in order",
    "to get rid of this discrepancy , there is also strong effort to obtain a global @xmath1+nucleus optical potential @xcite via @xmath1-elastic scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "theoretical cross sections are used in @xmath2-process network calculations and a deficiency in reaction rates can perhaps be responsible for the failure of @xmath2-process models in reproducing the observed @xmath0 isotope abundances in the mass range @xmath16 . for this reason",
    ", further experimental reaction studies should be performed at astrophysical relevant energies in order to improve both the experimental cross section database and the theoretical cross section calculations .",
    "although @xmath3ag is not a @xmath0 nucleus and mostly produced by the @xmath6 and @xmath7 processes , in order to further test the reliability of statistical model predictions in this mass range , the @xmath1-capture cross sections of @xmath3ag have been measured in the effective center of mass energy range between and using the activation method .",
    "these energies are close to the astrophysically relevant energy range ( the gamow window ) which extends from to at temperature typical for the @xmath2-process @xcite .",
    "the results were compared with hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations .",
    "details of the experiment are given in sec .",

    "the experimental results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : expresults ] . a comparison to statistical model calculations and a detailed discussion",

    "[ sec : summary ] provides conclusions and a summary .",
    "reaction cross sections of @xmath3ag(@xmath17 in and @xmath3ag(@xmath18 in have been measured at the laboratory energies between and . since the reaction products are radioactive and their half - lives are convenient , the activation method was used to determine the cross sections .",
    "detailed information about the activation method can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .    in the case of @xmath3ag(@xmath1,n )",
    "the reaction product @xmath5 in has a long - lived isomeric state .",
    "the partial cross sections leading to the ground as well as the isomeric states can be determined separately owing to the different decay patterns of the two states .",
    "the decay parameters used for the analysis are summarized in table [ tab : decaypar ] .",
    ".[tab : decaypar]decay parameters of reaction products taken from @xcite .",
    "only the @xmath2-transitions used for the analysis are listed . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : xs_an ]      the hauser - feshbach model of compound nuclear reactions makes use of averaged widths describing particle or photon emission from the formed compound nucleus @xcite .",
    "these averaged widths comprise sums over transition widths connecting the compound state and individual final states , determined by computing transmission coefficients from the solution of a time - independent schrdinger equation for each transition energetically possible and allowed by quantum mechanical selection rules @xcite .",
    "in addition to binding energies of the involved nuclei , optical potentials and low - lying , discrete excited states have to be known for the calculation of averaged particle - widths , and the @xmath2-strength function , discrete excited states , and nuclear level density enter the computation of the @xmath2-width .    for a correct interpretation of the differences between data and predictions ,",
    "it is necessary to study the sensitivities of the cross sections to the calculated averaged widths which , in turn , depend on different nuclear properties .",
    "these sensitivities are not only different for different reaction types but they are also energy dependent and , in consequence , variations of certain nuclear properties may have different impact on the resulting cross sections at lower and higher energy .",
    "sensitivities as a tool to understand the origin of discrepancies between data and theory have been thoroughly discussed in @xcite and have been used in previous investigations similar to the present one ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .    in general , the cross sections may be sensitive to several properties at a given energy . in this case",
    ", it is an advantage to have consistent data for two or more reaction channels at the same energy . here , we are able to simultaneously consider ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) and ( @xmath1,n ) data which allows to reduce ambiguities",
    ". the sensitivity factors of the cross sections of both reactions to variations in the averaged widths are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sensi_ag ] and [ fig : sensi_an ] . a sensitivity factor",
    "@xmath19 implies the cross section changing by a factor @xmath20 , when the corresponding width is changed by a factor of @xmath21 @xcite . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the original cross section has to be multiplied by @xmath23 whereas for @xmath24 it has to be divided by @xmath23 .",
    "this means that a negative sensitivity shows that the cross section will change in the opposite direction than the width , i.e. , it will increase when the width decreases and vice versa . as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : sensi_ag ] and [ fig : sensi_an ] , the cross sections of both reactions are sensitive to the @xmath1 width in the same manner across the investigated energy range but the sensitivity to neutron- and @xmath2-widths are different and opposite . both reactions are insensitive to a change of the proton width at the shown energies .    it should be noted that astrophysically relevant energies are located below the ( @xmath1,n ) threshold and therefore the astrophysically interesting width is the @xmath1 width .",
    "this led to the series of investigations to better constrain this width at low energy , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "it was found that the previous data could be described using an energy - dependent modification of the @xmath1 width which only acts at low energy @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 width was calculated using the well - known optical potential by @xcite with one modification : the depth of the volume imaginary part @xmath25 was made energy - dependent .",
    "it has to approach the value given in @xcite ( ) at high energy but has to be shallower at energies below the coulomb barrier energy @xmath26 .",
    "a fermi - type function was used to achieve this :    @xmath27    in previous work , the value @xmath28 for the `` diffuseness '' of the fermi - type function has been found to be between 2 and , depending on the reaction .",
    "using such a modified , effective optical potential it remains an open question whether the modification is really due to a required change in the optical potential , which affects the total reaction cross section , or due to the neglection of direct processes in the entrance channel @xcite .    here , we use a similar approach to be able to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "figure [ fig : ag ] and [ fig : an ] compares calculations performed with the smaragd code @xcite with the data .",
    "it can be seen that the prediction using the optical potential by @xcite ( labeled `` theo '' ) follows the ( @xmath1,n ) data quite well except at the lowest measured energy . on the other hand , the energy dependence of the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 )",
    "data is reproduced well but the calculation gives cross sections which are about @xmath29 times too large .    as found in figs .",
    "[ fig : sensi_ag ] and [ fig : sensi_an ] , at the upper end of the measured range the ( @xmath1,n ) reaction is only sensitive to the @xmath1 width .",
    "since the data are reproduced at these energies , the @xmath1 widths have to be accurately predicted there . at the same energies",
    "the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) reaction is sensitive not only to the @xmath1 width but also to the @xmath2- and neutron widths .",
    "since these widths have exactly opposite impact on the cross sections , only the change in the ratio @xmath30 of average @xmath2 width @xmath31 to average neutron width @xmath32 can be determined from the requirement to reproduce the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) data simultaneously with the ( @xmath1,n ) data .",
    "rescaling @xmath33 by a factor of 0.5 shifts the predicted cross sections down and excellent agreement with the experimental ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) cross sections is achieved at the higher energies .",
    "even with the adjusted ratio @xmath33 , cross sections at the lowest measured energies remain overpredicted . according to the sensitivities , the only way to mend",
    "this is to alter the @xmath1 width .",
    "the @xmath1 width , however , describes well the data at higher energies and therefore an energy - dependent modification is required .",
    "we chose the same parameterization as used in previous work and given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : param ] ) .",
    "we found that the best fit to the data can be obtained with .",
    "the resulting excitation functions are also shown in figure [ fig : ag ] and [ fig : an ] and labeled `` theo ( mod ) '' .",
    "these results are fully consistent with previous investigations , where a similar @xmath28 was found and a similar rescaling of the @xmath2 width relative to the neutron width was necessary .",
    "the @xmath3ag(@xmath17 in and @xmath3ag(@xmath1,n)@xmath5 in reaction cross sections have been measured in the effective center of mass energies between and , with the aim to extend the available database for improving predictions of the averaged @xmath1 widths at low energy .",
    "experimental results were compared with hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations .",
    "it was found that an energy - dependent modification of the @xmath1 width and a rescaling of the @xmath2- to neutron - width ratio is necessary .",
