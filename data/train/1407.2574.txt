    "the recent advent of muonic hydrogen spectroscopy @xcite is probing the limits of our understanding of the nucleon s electromagnetic structure . the unveiled discrepancy in the charge radius value between probing the nucleon with muons @xcite or electrons",
    "@xcite is only 4% , but is of great statistical significance ( 5 to 8 std deviations ) at the current level of precision .",
    "interestingly enough , the accuracy of both muonic - hydrogen and electron - scattering measurements is limited by the knowledge of subleading effects of nucleon structure , entering through the two - photon exchange ( tpe ) . the main aim of our present studies is to provide predictions for these contributions from first principles using a low - energy effective - field theory of qcd , referred to as the baryon chiral perturbation theory ( b@xmath4pt ) , see , e.g.  @xcite .    in this endeavor",
    "we are primarily concerned with the doubly - virtual compton scattering ( vvcs ) process which carries all the nucleon structure information of the tpe .",
    "unitarity ( optical theorem ) relates the imaginary part of the forward vvcs amplitude to nucleon structure functions , and then the use of dispersion relations allows one to write the low - energy expansion of vvcs in terms of moments of structure functions @xcite .",
    "the low - energy expansion of vvcs can , on the other hand , be directly computed in @xmath4pt .",
    "of course , not all of the moments enter the low - energy expansion of vvcs : either only odd or only even ones do , depending on the structure function . here",
    "we shall present the leading - order ( lo ) and next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) b@xmath4pt predictions for the following moments :    & & _ e1 ( q^2 ) + _ m1 ( q^2 ) = _ 0^x_0 x x f_1(x , q^2 ) , + & & _ l ( q^2 ) = _ 0^x_0 x f_l ( x , q^2 ) , + & & _ 0(q^2 ) = _ 0^x_0 x x^2g_tt(x , q^2 ) , + & & _",
    "lt(q^2 ) = _ 0^x_0 x x^2 , + [ eq : d2inel - def ] & & |d_2(q^2 ) = _ 0^x_0 x x^2 , + [ eq : ia - sumrule ] & & i_a(q^2 ) = _ 0^x_0 x g_tt(x , q^2 ) , + & & _",
    "1(q^2 ) = _ 0^x_0 x g_1(x , q^2 ) ,    where f_l & = & -2x f_1 + ( 1 + 4 m_n^2 x^2/q^2 ) f_2 , + g_tt & = & g_1- ( 4 m_n^2 x^2/q^2 ) g_2 , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 are respectively the unpolarized and polarized inelastic structure functions , which depend on the photon virtuality @xmath7 and the bjorken variable @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the nucleon mass and @xmath10 the photon energy ; @xmath11 corresponds with an inelastic threshold , such as that of a pion production ; @xmath12 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "these gold - plated moments have already been the subject of intense experimental studies @xcite , including an ongoing experimental program at jefferson laboratory  @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for review .",
    "the first four moments have the interpretation of generalized nucleon polarizabilities @xcite , @xmath13 at high @xmath7 represents a color polarizability @xcite or a color - lorentz force @xcite , @xmath14 is the generalized gdh integral and @xmath15 is the bjorken integral .",
    "we have computed the vvcs amplitude to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in the @xmath4pt expansion scheme with pion , nucleon , and @xmath16(1232 ) degrees of freedom , where the @xmath16-nucleon mass difference @xmath17 mev is an intermediate small scale , _ viz . _  the  @xmath18 expansion \" @xcite .",
    "this allows us to obtain the lo [ i.e. , @xmath19 and nlo [ i.e. , @xmath20 contributions to the moments listed above .",
    "the diagrams we needed to evaluate these two orders are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : loops_pv ] and [ fig : loopsd ] respectively . their detailed description can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where they are worked out for the case of real compton scattering , i.e.  @xmath21 .",
    "the extension to vvcs done in this work is rather tedious and will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "here we only note that the extension to finite @xmath7 for the @xmath16-isobar contributions , arising here at nlo , follows closely ref .",
    "@xcite ; in particular , the magnetic @xmath22 coupling @xmath23 , entering the first graph of , acquires a dipole form factor .",
    "further details are available in a mathematica notebook in ref .",
    "@xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", there are no free parameters to fit at these orders , hence this calculation is ` predictive ' .",
    "-loop graphs contributing to compton scattering at @xmath24 .",

    ".the nlo b@xmath4pt predictions for the forward vvcs polarizabilities ( at @xmath21 ) compared with the available empirical information . where the reference is not given , the empirical number is provided by the maid analysis @xcite , with unspecified uncertainty .",

    "[ fig : gridscalars ] to [ fig : gamma1 ] , as function of @xmath7 . in the figures ,",
    "the lo b@xmath4pt is given by the red solid curves , while the complete result , including the nlo and the uncertainty estimate ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , is given by the blue bands .",
    "in all the plots , the black dotted curves represent the empirical evaluation using the 2007 version of the mainz online partial - wave analysis of meson electroproduction ( maid ) @xcite . some of the plots contain data points described in the legends .",
    "other curves represent previous @xmath4pt evaluations , as will be discussed further .",
    "the scalar polarizabilities of the proton and the neutron are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gridscalars ] . here",
    "the blue dashed lines denote the lo of heavy - baryon ( hb ) @xmath4pt .",
    "it exactly corresponds with the static - nucleon approximation of the lo b@xmath4pt .",
    "given the large differences between the two ( hb vs.  b : blue dashed vs.  red solid lines ) , we conclude that the static - nucleon approximation does not work well in any of these cases .",
    "the hb result happens to be in remarkable agreement with the data at @xmath21 , but much less so at finite @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the agreement is lost in hb when the @xmath25-resonance is included  @xcite , whereas the relativistic result leaves the room for a natural accommodation of the @xmath25 contribution @xcite . comparing the lo and nlo b@xmath4pt results",
    ", we see that the @xmath25 contributions are very significant in the combination @xmath26 , but not in @xmath27 .",
    "it is known that the @xmath28 is not as easily excited by longitudinal photons as it is by magnetic ones , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the spin polarizabilities @xmath29 and @xmath30 are shown in fig .  [ fig : gridspin ] .",
    "these quantities deserve a more extensive discussion since they were traditionally hard to reproduce in @xmath4pt . in the case of @xmath2",
    "this problem became known as the  @xmath2 puzzle \" .",
    "obviously our complete result ( blue bands ) is in a reasonable agreement with the empirical information , so where is the problem ?",
    "the @xmath2-puzzle was first observed in the hb variant of @xmath4pt @xcite , which invokes an additional semi - relativistic expansion , in the inverse nucleon mass .",
    "evidently , this expansion works poorly for these quantities : compare the hb ( blue dashed ) curves , which only for @xmath2 are within the scale of the figure , with the corresponding b@xmath4pt calculation ( blue bands ) . first attempts to go beyond hb were done in the infrared - regularized ( ir ) version of b@xmath4pt @xcite , which has an incorrect analytic structure ( unphysical branch cuts ) , leading to results shown by the red bands  @xcite . having the relativistic result with unphysical analytic structure",
    "obviously did not solve the problem  the disagreement of the red bands with the data or the maid is too large .",
    "more recently , a first b@xmath4pt calculation has appeared  @xcite , shown by the grey bands in the figure .",
    "as one can see , for @xmath31 it works much better than the hb and ir counterparts . in the lower panel , it seems to resolve the @xmath2-puzzle for the neutron , albeit at the expense of introducing it for the proton . indeed , despite having presently no experimental data for the proton , we anticipate them to follow closely to the maid result , shown by the black dotted line .",
    "again , @xmath2 would not be reproduced simultaneously for the proton and neutron .",
    "in contrast , the present calculation ( blue bands ) shows no puzzle in either the proton or the neutron , and hence the question of what exactly is the difference between the two b@xmath4pt calculations is to be addressed . at the level of @xmath32 loops they are equivalent ,",
    "however the inclusion of the @xmath16-isobar is done in different counting schemes : `` @xmath18 counting '' here vs.  the  small - scale expansion \" in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter case , more graphs with @xmath16 are included , particularly those with photons coupling to the @xmath16 in the loops .",
    "they are the only good candidates to account for the difference between the two calculations .",
    "we have checked that our result for the @xmath16-isobar contribution to @xmath2 agrees with the expectation from the maid analysis , where a separate estimate of this contribution can be obtained . the corresponding effect in ref .",
    "@xcite , measured by the difference between the grey and red curves in the figure for @xmath2 of the proton , is about an order of magnitude larger and has an opposite sign .",
    "we next turn to @xmath14 and @xmath33 moments shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gridgdh ] . the lo result here ( red solid line )",
    "is already in agreement with the experimental data where available .",
    "going to nlo ( i.e. , including the @xmath16 ) does not change the picture qualitatively in our b@xmath4pt calculation ( blue bands ) .",
    "the effect of the @xmath16 is appreciably larger again for the proton in the b@xmath4pt calculation of bernard _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite ( grey bands ) .",
    "the @xmath34 hb@xmath4pt result without explicit @xmath16 s ( blue dashed lines ) is in disagreement with the experimental data , and in worse agreement with the empirical picture from maid .",
    "note that by means of the gdh sum rule , @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon .",
    "the @xmath4pt calculations are ( at @xmath21 ) fixed to this value due to renormalization , while in the maid evaluation it comes out differently .",
    "this difference can perhaps serve as a rough uncertainty estimate of the maid evaluation .",
    "the last moment in , @xmath37 , is the first cornwall - norton moment of the inelastic spin structure function @xmath38 , i.e.  the inelastic part of the bjorken integral .",
    "the isovector ( p@xmath39n ) combination for this moment is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma1 ] . here",
    "the hb@xmath4pt , the previous  @xcite and the present b@xmath4pt calculations compare fairly well with the experimental data of refs .",
    "the maid analysis is in worse agreement .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma1 ] we show @xmath40 for the proton . here",
    "the discrepancy of the b@xmath4pt calculations with the experimental data is most appreciable . at @xmath21 ,",
    "this quantity is expressed in terms of the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton : @xmath41 the empirical result of maid is not entirely consistent with this constraint , just as in the case of @xmath14 .",
    "however it is consistent with experimental data , leaving one to wonder whether in either of them the integral @xmath42 is evaluated accurately .",
    "we conclude by making the connection to the charge radius problem mentioned in the beginning . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we presented the leading - order predictions for the proton _ polarizability _ effect in the lamb shift of muonic hydrogen .",
    "it is based on the same b@xmath4pt framework and the same vvcs amplitude as the present work .",
    "the magnitude of the effect turned out to be in agreement with models based on dispersion relations , but not with the results of hb@xmath4pt @xcite which indicate a substantially larger effect . given that the longitudinal response of the nucleon is predominant in the atoms , we focus on the polarizabilities @xmath27 and @xmath3 and observe that the difference between b and hb @xmath4pt results is substantial indeed ( cf . , lower panels in figs .",
    "[ fig : gridscalars ] and [ fig : gridspin ] ) .",
    "it is especially large in the scalar polarizability @xmath27 which is relevant to the lamb shift ; the spin polarizability @xmath2 may only affect the hyperfine splitting .",
    "thanks to the available empirical information , provided by the maid analysis , we conclude that the longitudinal response of the nucleon is largely overestimated in hb@xmath4pt .    in overall",
    "the b@xmath4pt predictions presented here are in good ( within 3 std deviations ) agreement with the empirical information on the gold - plated moments of nucleon structure functions .",
    "the most appreciable disagreement of the present b@xmath4pt calculation with experiment is observed in the integral @xmath42 .",
    "for the first time , the spin polarizability @xmath2 is reproduced for both the proton and the neutron within a free - parameter - free ( predictive ) @xmath4pt calculation , thus potentially closing the issue of the  @xmath2 puzzle \" .",
    "the latter statement relies of course on the empirical results of maid for the proton @xmath2 .",
    "the forthcoming measurement at jefferson laboratory is called to provide the data for that observable , hence putting to the test the maid and present @xmath4pt results .",
    "we thank marc vanderhaeghen for insightful discussions and lothar tiator for kindly providing us with the maid results .",
