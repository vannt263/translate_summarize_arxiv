    "owing to the long half - life of @xmath1re , the @xmath1re-@xmath1os pair may serve as a cosmochronometer to measure the duration of stellar nucleosynthesis that precedes the solidification of the solar system @xcite . by adding the age of the solar system ( @xmath64.6 gyr ) ,",
    "it provides the age of the galaxy .",
    "the facts that both @xmath0os and @xmath1os are produced only by the s - process nucleosynthesis apart from the cosmoradiogenic yield of @xmath1os and that the isotopic solar abundance ratio of @xmath0os and @xmath1os @xcite is available make this chronometer potentially reliable in the sense that it is independent of r - process models .",
    "the quantitative interpretation is , however , complicated by the possible enhancement of @xmath1re-@xmath1os transmutation rates in stellar condition , the stellar production and destruction of @xmath1re and @xmath1os during the chemical evolution of the galaxy , the possible existence of s - process branchings at @xmath7w and @xmath0re , and the neutron capture by the 9.75 kev first excited state in @xmath1os @xcite .",
    "the last issue on the effect of neutron capture on the 9.75 kev state in @xmath1os was raised in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the local approximation",
    ", the ratio of the s - process yields of @xmath0os and @xmath1os , @xmath8 , can be expressed as    @xmath9    here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the maxwellian - averaged neutron capture cross sections on @xmath0os and @xmath1os in the ground states , respectively .",
    "the @xmath12 value accounts for the correction to the cross section due to the neutron capture on the 9.75 kev state in @xmath1os which is substantially populated at typical s - process temperatures @xmath131 - 3@xmath14 k. it is defined by    @xmath15    with @xmath16 being the maxwellian - averaged neutron capture cross section on @xmath1os at a given stellar temperature . here",
    ", the first excited state in @xmath0os and the second excited state in @xmath1os lie at higher excitation energies of 137 kev and 74 kev , respectively , and therefore their contributions to neutron capture in the stellar condition may safely be ignored . in 1970s",
    ", it was of critical concern whether or not the @xmath12 value exceeds unity , because it has a great impact on the age of the galaxy ; the larger the @xmath12 , the smaller the age .",
    "however , there was a large spread in the early estimate ( 0.80 - 1.10 @xcite , 0.8 @xcite , and @xmath61.5 @xcite ) .",
    "this concern , combined with the fact that a direct measurement of neutron capture on the 9.75 kev state is virtually impossible , led to measurements of neutron capture on @xmath17os @xcite and neutron inelastic scattering to the 9.75 kev state in @xmath1os @xcite .",
    "the measured neutron capture cross sections were in good agreement with those of the earlier measurements @xcite .",
    "but , the statistical analysis of the capture data gave a lower bound of 0.30 @xmath18 to the inelastic scattering cross section @xmath19 at a neutron energy of 30 kev , and by combining with an upper limit of @xmath20 @xmath18 @xcite , gave @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , the two neutron inelastic scattering data , @xmath22 @xmath18 at 60 kev @xcite and @xmath23 @xmath18 at 34 kev @xcite , are consistent with @xmath240.80 - 0.83 and 0.80 , respectively , within the statistical models .",
    "more recent efforts have been made toward a unified statistical model analysis of all available data including measurements of ( @xmath25 ) cross sections @xcite and elastic / inelastic scattering cross sections @xcite on a neighboring nucleus @xmath26os in which the ground state with @xmath27 = 3/2@xmath28 and the first excited state with 1/2@xmath28 at 36 kev appear in the reverse order of the corresponding states in @xmath1os .",
    "these analyses showed that @xmath12=0.79 - 0.83 .    in the hauser - feshbach statistical model calculations",
    ", however , large uncertainties may arise from the @xmath29-ray transmission coefficients rather than the neutron optical potential and the level density .",
    "information on the @xmath29-ray transmission coefficients for neutron captured states in the low - energy tail of the giant dipole resonance in @xmath2os can be obtained in the inverse photo - disintegration of @xmath2os .",
    "but , the conventional lorentzian model based on the previous photo - disintegration data on @xmath2os @xcite may not be satisfactory for two reasons .",
    "one reason is that the data taken with @xmath29-ray beams from the positron annihilation in flight exhibit non - vanishing cross sections even below the neutron threshold ( see sec . [ sec - cross ] ) .",
    "the non - vanishing cross sections may be attributed to contributions from the positron bremsstrahlung .",
    "the other is that microscopic models can predict the @xmath4 @xmath29 strength function more reliably than the lorentzian model .",
    "besides @xmath12 , the effect of the s - process branchings at @xmath7w and/or @xmath0re was parameterized as @xmath30 and investigated within the framework of the schematic s - process models @xcite .",
    "more recently , neutron capture cross sections were measured for neighboring @xmath7re and @xmath1re nuclei to derive the statistical model parameters from a consistent systematics @xcite . with the improved parameters for s - process analysis",
    ", a stellar model calculation for low - mass agb stars showed that the local approximation was disturbed by the branchings at @xmath7w and @xmath0re .",
    "however , the precise physical conditions of the agb model need to be scrutinized before any definite conclusion on @xmath30 is drawn .",

    ", the relevant statistical parameters , particularly the @xmath4 @xmath29 strength function , can further be improved by the photo - disintegration measurement on @xmath0w .    in the present study , we have measured photoneutron cross sections of @xmath0w , @xmath1re and @xmath2os using tunable quasi - monochromatic @xmath29-ray beams from laser compton scattering ( lcs ) .",

    "the uncertainty in the neutron energy thus determined was estimated to be 10 - 15 kev , resulting in the uncertainty less than 0.8 % in the total neutron detection efficiency .",
    "note that the total efficiency is nearly constant ( 44.4 - 44.3 % ) over the neutron energy from 1 mev to 400 kev and that it slowly decreases to 39.5 % at 50 kev . the overall systematic uncertainty for cross sections",
    "was estimated to be 5.9 - 8.3 % , which was determined by the neutron emission rate of the calibration source ( 5 % ) , the number of the incident lcs photons ( 3 % ) , and the beam size effect .",
