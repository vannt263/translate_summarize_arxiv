    "according to the landau theory of phase transitions , the phases on both sides of a critical point can be distinguished by different types of the long - range order , or its absence .",
    "the ordering is described by an appropriately chosen local order parameter . in the landau framework phases",
    "are distinct due to their different symmetries , and a continuous phase transition is always related to spontaneous breaking of system s hamiltonian symmetry .",
    "@xcite    however , there is a mounting number of examples of systems where the states of matter and their change can not be classified in terms of the apparent symmetry breaking and/or local order parameter , most notably a particular class of gapped systems known as quantum spin liquids.@xcite one of the best known example of such quantum liquids is realized in the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "most likely , such a quantum ( resonating valence bond ) spin liquid is also seen in the pseudogap phase of the high-@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "@xcite low - dimensional and/or frustrated systems provide a lot of possibilities for realization of various exotic quantum liquid states , where a local long - range order is prevented even at zero temperature . in low - dimensional quantum magnets , fermions , and topological insulators / superconductors the existence of gapped phases and transitions between them",
    "are not necessarily accompanied by breaking of some symmetry associated with local observables .",
    "see @xcite and more references there .    to characterize these",
    "states a concept of _ topological order _ was introduced .",
    "@xcite the exact definition of this concept is a really subtle issue . @xcite it is often associated with the nontrivial pontryagin , chern or similar topological numbers ( indices ) .",
    "@xcite hatsugai and co - workers @xcite proposed the quantized berry phase as a quantum order parameter to probe nonlocal orders .",
    "this scheme was successfully applied , e.g. , for several quantum spin liquid systems .",
    "it turns out that the change of the quantized berry phase can diagnose also crossovers between the states which are not separated by gap closing , local symmetry or order changes .",
    "@xcite    it has been also suggested that topological entanglement , derived from the von neumann entropy , provides another quantitative measure of topological order since quantum critical points separating different phases can be identified with extrema of the entanglement entropy .",
    "@xcite    to characterize phases with hidden nonlocal or topological orders the concept of string order parameter ( sop ) introduced by den nijs and rommelse is particularly instrumental .",
    "@xcite the appearance of such nonlocal order is accompanied by a hidden symmetry breaking .",
    "@xcite sops are successfully applied to characterize quantum phases with hidden orders in various spin chains and ladders at zero temperature.@xcite    the important property of sop is that it can be used for both quantum and thermal phase transitions .",
    "for instance , the sop can be used for analysis of the thermal transitions into a kosterlitz - thouless - type phase with an algebraic order.@xcite very importantly , the sop is a proper order parameter in the sense of landau : for the integrable models one can calculate exactly the critical indices @xmath3 and @xmath4 from the sop and the string - string correlation function , resp .",
    ", near the critical point @xcite and check explicitly that such @xmath3 , @xmath4 along with other critical indices satisfy the standard hyperscaling relations . @xcite since the sop is a limit of a nonlocal correlation function , its analytical calculation is a difficult task even for exactly solvable models .",
    "for example , for the dimerized heisenberg spin-@xmath0 chain the calculation is quite simple in the leading sine - gordon approximation for the hamiltonian @xcite , while taking into account the marginal terms renders the problem much more difficult @xcite , and more work is still needed .",
    "the other subtlety is that only for a spin chain or a two - leg ladder the definition of the sops is straightforward , while already for a three - leg ladder @xcite , to say nothing about a 2d lattice , there are many ways to define the sop .",
    "potential multitude of sops and their critical properties need further analysis .",
    "there is an extensive recent literature on hidden orders in massive phases of heisenberg ladders . in particular",
    ", the critical properties of the dimerized two- and three - leg ladders have been studied in numerical and analytical works .",
    "@xcite quantum critical lines or even gapless regions in the parameter space adjacent to various massive phases of spin ladders may be also induced by frustrations , magnetic fields , or four - spin interactions .",
    "@xcite    the nonlocal sop can be defined for bosonic systems as well .",
    "@xcite moreover , this nonlocal order was even observed for bosons in optical lattice .",
    "@xcite    another interesting class of models where nonlocal string - like order parameters turned out to be essential are the probabilistic cellular automata which have been experiencing a steadily growing interest during the last several decades .",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that the active phases of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional automation models possess numerous percolative nonlocal order parameters emerging as cascades of geometric phase transitions .",
    "there has been an opinion expressed in the literature that various low - dimensional fermionic or spin systems with hiddenly ordered phases and transitions between them , defy completely the landau paradigm .",
    "it appears to us that such a claim is too radical , and one can formulate the theory of such transitions consistent with the landau framework using the nonlocal sops.@xcite the landau picture needs however to be amended , since some facets of topological order quantified by topological indices , berry phases , entanglement , are not reducible even to nonlocal sops .",
    "the major problem is that the current treatment of such systems in most cases is heavily numerical and the qualitative physical picture is obscured .",
    "it is really warranted to put more weight first on advancing relatively simple analytical approaches based on the effective ( mean - field ) models , similar , e.g. , to the kitaev model @xcite , or the single - particle tight - binding models used for the analyses of the topological insulators and superconductors.@xcite results based on those models clearly indicate that interactions are not an indispensable element of the topological order framework .    in the present paper",
    "we carry out such program from analyses of the dimerized @xmath1 chain and the two - leg heisenberg ladders with staggered and columnar dimerizations .",
    "the first exactly - solvable model is equivalent to noninteracting jordan - wigner fermions . to treat the ladders",
    ", we use the jordan - wigner tranformation and the mean - field approximation to obtain an effective free - fermionic hamiltonian for the spin ladder . in the earlier related work",
    "it has been shown that such approximation is quite adequate , even quantitatively .",
    "@xcite by utilizing duality transformations we demonstrate that it is possible to map the problem of calculation of nonlocal sops in the chain and ladders onto the problem of a local ( landau ) order parameter in the dual representation , where the dual models are given by exactly - solvable hamiltonians and their order parameters can be calculated exactly .",
    "it is then also straightforward to relate appearance of the sop with the spontaneous symmetry breaking in terms of the dual hamiltonian .",
    "in addition we show that the gapped phases not only have distinct sops , but they can also be distinguished by the winding ( pontryagin ) number .",
    "these results allow us to stress close similarities between various gapped phases occurring in spin models and topological insulators / supecronductors .",
    "the latter are of great current interest .",

    "the definition we use here @xcite is more consistent with the standard theory of critical phenomena and is in line with the definition of the landau order parameter via a correlation function of local operators .",
    "we will show that in the critical region @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a distance from the critical point and the critical index of the order parameter @xmath3 correctly enters all the hyperscaling relations .    using the duality transformation ( [ sigmax ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ sopdef ] ) we get @xmath44 so , the nonlocal sop defined on the sites of the direct lattice becomes a local order parameter on the dual lattice .",

    "according to the classical results @xcite for the 1d qim with the hamiltonian @xmath45~,\\ ] ] the model is disordered at @xmath46 , while the long - range order @xmath47 appears at @xmath48 .",

    "ii . one can check that our sop is proportional to the sop of kim and other workers , but it is given by a simpler analytical formula .",

    "in such case we obtain the odd sop : @xmath192        we calculated the order parameter of the three - spin ising chain in the appendix . using the results presented there , we obtain : @xmath193^{1/8 }   &   |\\kappa / \\delta | \\geq 1 \\\\ 0 & |\\kappa /\\delta| < 1 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath194 is given by . the odd sop can be calculated from the results of barouch and mccoy@xcite @xmath195^{1/8 }   & |\\kappa /\\delta| \\leq 1 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] in agreement with earlier results @xcite we find that the even and odd sops are mutually exclusive .",
    "they detect hidden @xmath196 symmetry breaking @xcite and ordering in the even or odd sectors of the dual hamiltonian .",
    "note that contrary to its even counterpart , the string for the odd sop misses two sites at the opposite ends of the ladder .",
    "the order probed by @xmath54 is topologically nontrivial , since it corresponds to nonzero winding numbers .",

    "analysis of the columnar phase is done similarly .",
    "the sites of the columnar ladder are labelled along the jwt path in fig .",
    "[ jwpath ] .",
    "the majorana representation of the columnar hamiltonian can be mapped via transformations ( [ xx],[yy ] ) onto dual spins . again",
    "the dual hamiltonian splits into even and odd sectors @xmath199 , where the odd term is the hamiltonian of the dimerized @xmath21 ( @xmath83 ) chain in the alternating field , while the even term corresponds to its dual model which is the ising chain in the alternating transverse field with the three - spin interactions . since these models are always gapped ( cf .",
    "eq .  ) and do not undergo any phase transitions , we will not discuss the properties of the columnar phase in more detail .",
    "note a very remarkable property of the effective hamiltonian : for both dimerization patterns it decouples into the reciprocally dual even and odd sectors @xmath200 , i.e. these hamiltonians map onto each other @xmath201 under the duality transformation ( [ sigmax],[sigmay ] ) .",
    "in this work we studied quantum phase transitions in the antiferromagnetic dimerized spin-@xmath0 @xmath1 chain and two - leg ladders . the common feature of these models is a subtle interplay of relevant perturbations each of which results in a gap creation in the spectrum .",
    "there are however lines of quantum criticality where those perturbations cancel and the models become gapless .",
    "we analyzed the properties of the different phases of these models .",
    "the dimerized @xmath1 chain is equivalent to the noninteracting fermions and is mapped by a duality transformation onto two 1d qims residing separately on even and odd sites of the dual lattice .",
    "the sops for the original chain are mapped onto the local ( landau ) order parameters of these dual qims and thus calculated exactly . as follows from the duality mapping , the dimerized @xmath1 model possesses the hidden @xmath68 symmetry , and nonzero sops are due to spontaneous breaking of the @xmath69 symmetry in the even or odd sectors of the dual hamiltonian .",
    "the phase diagram of the model contains topologically trivial phases where the even and odd sops coexist along with the conventional long - range order ( magnetization ) .",
    "there are also topologically nontrivial phases without conventional order where only the even or odd nonlocal sops exist .",
    "in addition the winding numbers are calculated .",
    "their values are consistent with the topologically trivial or nontrivial nature of each phase .",
    "these analyses and results are quite similar to those for the cluster ising chain models which attracted attention in recent literature @xcite in the context of quantum computation .",
    "these exactly solvable models with multi - spin interactions are equivalent to free fermions , and both the conventional and nonlocal sops they manifest are readily calculated , similarly to what we have done for the dimerized xy chain .    to extend the framework shown to work so well for the exactly solvable models , the fermionization of the dimerized two - leg ladders was followed up by a mean - field approximation .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian was then treated as a new effective free - fermionic model .",
    "the predictions of this effective hamiltonian for the critical properties and phase diagram of the ladders with the staggered or columnar dimerizations are in agreement to what is known from earlier work . from the majorana representation of the effective hamiltonian we constructed its transformation to new dual spins .",
    "the staggered effective hamiltonian maps onto the sum of the decoupled even and odd dual exactly - solvable hamiltonians .",
    "the even term is the quantum ising chain with three - spin interaction , while the odd term is the @xmath1 chain in a uniform transverse field .",
    "interestingly , the even and odd sectors map onto each other under the duality transformations .",
    "the sops of the original spin ladders are calculated as the local order parameters in the dual models .",
    "we defined two mutually exclusive ( even and odd ) sops which detect breaking of the hidden @xmath68 ladder symmetry .",
    "one of those sops probes topologically trivial phase , while another corresponds to the topologically nontrivial phase .",
    "this statement is also corroborated by the calculation of the winding numbers for those phases .",
    "similar mappings and dualities are found for the columnar dimerized ladder , but this case is not very interesting , since the columnar ladder is always gapped and does not undergo phase transitions .",
    "our main result is the framework to treat nonlocal orders and hidden symmetries which unifies the key elements of the landau paradigm with the new concept of topological order .",
    "this unified framework can be straightforwardly applied for such important physical systems as spin chain and ladders , topological insulators and superconductors . as we have shown throughout our analysis , the fermionic hamiltonians ( exact or effective ) we used for the chain or ladder models are equivalent to tight - binding hamiltonians of topological materials . to probe the topological order in the latter one",
    "needs the majorana string operators which can be straightforwardly mapped onto the local parameters via the duality transformations we applied in this work .",
    "one more point needs to be emphasized . in the present study",
    "we did not need to build up the full - size formalism based on the ginzburg - landau effective potential written in terms of the dual spins ( @xmath29 ) , since the quadratic majorana hamiltonian ( exact , as in the case of the @xmath1 chain , or an effective mean - field approximation , as in the case of ladders ) maps onto exactly solvable dual 1d spin models .",
    "so , the key notions of the landau framework : order parameters , spontaneous symmetry breaking , etc , are easily identified and calculated from those models without any additional approximations .",
    "that is why we obtain the critical indices of the 2d ising universality class ( e.g. , @xmath202 ) , but not the mean - field ones ( @xmath203 ) which a nave landau theory would predict .",
    "there are other topologically - ordered lattice systems , including those in higher dimensions which can be mapped via various duality transformations onto the systems with the landau local orders .",
    "@xcite we are currently working on applying the present approach to the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg @xmath204-leg ladders and tubes .",
    "the key step is to obtain the effective mean - field quadratic fermionic hamiltonian consistent with the @xmath136-flux theorem .",
    "@xcite the transformations to the dual spins maps the majorana fermion models onto exactly solvable ising chains with multi - spin interactions .",
    "the local order parameters of these dual models ( i.e. , the sops of the original spin ladders or tubes ) can be calculated via toeplitz determinants . @xcite",
    "another interesting developments of the proposed formalism would be its extension for the exotic thermal phases in classical spin models , as , e.g. , the algebraically - ordered topological floating phase occurring in some frustrated 2d ising models.@xcite    we thank v. lahtinen , f. mila , z. nussinov , and j.h.h .",

    "<S> after mapping of the original spin hamiltonians onto the tight - binding models with dirac or majorana fermions and the mean - field approximation ( for ladders ) , the essential physics of nonlocal orders can be grasped analytically . by utilizing duality transformations the calculation of sops </S>",
    "<S> is mapped onto the local order problem in some dual representation and done without further approximations . </S>",
    "<S> the phases with hidden orders can also be distinguished by topological winding numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the latter provide a complimentary description . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is the framework to treat nonlocal orders and hidden symmetries which unifies the key elements of the landau paradigm with the new concept of topological order . </S>",
    "<S> this unified framework can be straightforwardly applied for spin chain and ladders , topological insulators and superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> applications of this theory to other systems are under way . </S>"
