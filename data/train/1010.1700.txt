    "many of the key developments in the study of two - dimensional critical phenomena originate from the study of only a very few lattice models @xcite . these include dimer coverings , the ising and six - vertex models , the o(@xmath6 ) model , and the @xmath0-state potts model .",
    "the latter two models are particularly important , as they can be formulated in terms of geometrical degrees of freedom that in turn describe extended fluctuating objects , such as domain walls in magnets , percolation clusters , and polymers adsorbed on walls and interfaces @xcite .",
    "these objects are in fact conformally invariant whenever @xmath6 or @xmath7 is comprised in the range @xmath8 , and their fluctuations are characterised by critical exponents .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to revisit the geometrical formulation of the two - dimensional potts model . in particular , we shall define a set of geometrical observables which are different from those considered in most of the existing literature .",
    "these observables are simply the domain walls in the formulation of the potts model in terms of @xmath0-component spins .",
    "not only are they in many ways more natural and physically more relevant than the fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) clusters @xcite usually considered , but they also turn out to have a richer critical behaviour and a more complete set of critical exponents .",
    "these features stem in part from the fact that there are actually two different types of spin domain walls ( thin and thick ) , as we shall explain shortly .",
    "the @xmath0-state potts model is defined by the partition function z = _ _ ( ij ) e ( k _ _ i,_j ) , [ potts ] where @xmath9 is the coupling between spins @xmath10 along the edges @xmath11 of some lattice @xmath12 . for simplicity",
    "we shall take @xmath12 to be the square lattice in the computations below , whereas we use the triangular lattice in the figures .",
    "the kronecker delta function @xmath13 equals 1 if @xmath14 , and 0 otherwise .    the usual route @xcite is to write the obvious identity ( k _ _ i,_j ) = 1 + v _ _",
    "i,_j , with @xmath15 , and to expand @xmath16 in powers of @xmath17 .",
    "the result is an expression of @xmath16 as a sum over fk clusters with weight @xmath17 per unit length and fugacity @xmath0 per connected component .",
    "alternatively one can think of the fk clusters in terms of their surrounding hulls , which are self and mutually avoiding loops with fugacity @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "most features of these fk clusters and loops , in the critical regime @xmath19 , are by now under complete control , thanks to the combined powers of conformal field theory ( cft ) and schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) @xcite . in particular",
    ", the loops behave like the sle trace in the continuum limit @xcite , and viewing them as contour lines of a ( deformed ) gaussian free field leads to the coulomb gas ( cg ) approach to cft @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the critical properties of fk clusters and loops can be considered almost complete , although some of their more intricate observables  such as the backbone @xcite and shortest - path @xcite dimensions  are still unknown .",
    "the expansion in powers of @xmath17 has some pleasing features , notably that the fk clusters coincide with percolation clusters in the formal limit @xmath20 .",
    "but apart from that it is somewhat artificial in view of the original formulation ( [ potts ] ) in terms of @xmath0-component spins . in particular ,",
    "albeit two lattice sites belonging to the same fk cluster will necessarily have the same spin value , the converse is not true .",
    "it would therefore seem more natural to perform the expansion in powers of @xmath21 and consider as basic geometrical observables the connected domains with a constant value of the potts spin , henceforth referred to as _",
    "spin clusters_.    the properties of these spin clusters have as a rule remained ill understood .",
    "this is particularly frustrating , since those are the very clusters that one would observe in an actual experiment on a magnetic alloy in the potts universality class .",
    "the case of the ising model @xmath22 is an exception to this rule @xcite , but this is due to its `` coincidental '' equivalence to the o(@xmath6 ) vector model with @xmath23 . indeed , defining the ising spins on the triangular lattice , the corresponding o(@xmath6 ) model is described by self and mutually avoiding loops on the hexagonal lattice , and such loops are readily treated by cft and sle techniques .     potts model , and",
    "the corresponding set of branching domain walls.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]   potts model , and the corresponding set of branching domain walls.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    for general @xmath0 , the salient feature of potts spin clusters is that the domain walls separating different clusters undergo branchings and crossings ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pottsdw ] ) .",
    "these phenomena are however absent for @xmath22 with the above choice of lattice .",
    "it is precisely these branchings and crossings that make the application of exact techniques  such as cg mappings or bethe ansatz diagonalisation  very difficult , if not impossible .",
    "the belief that spin clusters are indeed conformally invariant for other values of @xmath24 in the critical regime has even been challenged at times , but seems however well established by now @xcite .",
    "some progress has been accomplished in the @xmath25 case @xcite by speculating that the spin clusters in the critical potts model would be equivalent to fk clusters in the _ tricritical _ potts model @xcite .",
    "this equivalence has however not been proven , and is moreover restricted so far to the simplest geometrical questions @xcite .",
    "the equivalence can also be understood as a relationship with the dilute o(@xmath6 ) model @xcite .",
    "the potts model has been used recently to build a new class of 2d quantum lattice models that exhibit topological order @xcite .",
    "both fk clusters and domain walls between spin clusters are important in these models .",
    "we should also mention that spin domain walls have been studied numerically  and their difference from the fk clusters pointed out  in the context of the @xmath26 parafermionic models @xcite .",
    "apart from issues of branching and crossing , another major hurdle in the study of potts spin clusters has come from the lack of a formulation that can be conveniently extended to @xmath0 a real variable . in the case of loops surrounding the fk clusters ,",
    "this formulation led naturally to the introduction of powerful algebraic tools via the temperley - lieb ( tl ) algebra , and to the equivalence with the six - vertex model ",
    "the eventual key to the exact solution of the problem @xcite .",
    "factors of @xmath0 then appear naturally through a parameter in the tl algebra , or  via a geometrical construction  as complex vertex weights in the six - vertex formulation . also for spin clusters can @xmath0 be promoted to an arbitrary variable : the weight of a set of spin clusters is simply the chromatic polynomial of the graph dual to the domain walls . from the point of view of the tl algebra ,",
    "the domain walls are composite ( spin-1 ) objects , hence more complicated than the fk clusters and loops .",
    "recent work on the related birman - wenzl - murakami ( bwm ) algebra @xcite suggests that this formulation might be amenable to the standard algebraic and bethe ansatz techniques , although such a lofty goal has not been achieved so far .    in this paper",
    "we report major progress towards the understanding of potts spin clusters , both in the bulk and the boundary case . a brief account on the bulk case",
    "has recently appeared elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our results are of two kinds .",
    "on the one hand , we develop a transfer matrix technique which allows the formulation and numerical study of the spin clusters for all real @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "we identify the geometrical events that give rise to conformal correlations , and provide exact ( albeit numerically determined ) expressions for infinite families of critical exponents , similar to the familiar `` @xmath27-legs '' exponents @xcite for tl loops .",
    "surprisingly , we find that geometrical properties of spin clusters encompass all integer indices @xmath28 in the kac table @xmath29 .",
    "an analytical derivation of our results appears for now beyond reach , in part because the algebraic properties of our transfer matrix are still ill understood .",
    "we do however provide some exact results based on an approach which does not involve a cg mapping , but rather the use of a massless scattering description .",
    "apart from the bulk critical exponents @xcite , we report here the boundary critical exponents for free , fixed , and mixed boundary conditions .",
    "this means that the potts spins on a segment of the boundary are restricted to take @xmath30 values , where @xmath30 can assume any real value and is in general different from the number of states @xmath0 taken by bulk spins .",
    "these results can be viewed as a further step in the programme @xcite of classifying non - unitary boundary conditions in 2d geometrical models .",
    "the domain wall ( dw ) expansion of ( [ potts ] ) involves all possible configurations of domain walls that can be drawn on the dual of @xmath31 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dwgraph ] ) .",
    "a dw configuration is given by a graph @xmath32 ( not necessarily connected ) .",
    "the faces of @xmath32 are the spin clusters . since we do not specify the colour of each of these clusters , a dw configuration has to be weighted by the chromatic polynomial @xmath33 of the dual graph @xmath34 .",
    "initially @xmath33 is defined as the number of colourings of the vertices of the graph @xmath34 , using colours @xmath35 , with the constraint that neighbouring vertices have different colours .",
    "this is indeed a polynomial in @xmath0 for any @xmath32 , and so can be evaluated for any real @xmath0 ( but @xmath33 is integer only when @xmath0 is integer ) .",
    "for example , the chromatic polynomial of the graph @xmath34 on fig .",
    "[ fig : dwgraph ] is @xmath36 .    , and its dual graph @xmath34.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ] , and its dual graph @xmath34.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the partition function ( [ potts ] )",
    "can thus be written as a sum over all possible dw configurations z = e^n k _ g ( e^-k ) ^length(g ) _ ( q ) [ pottsdw ] where @xmath37 is the number of spins , and @xmath38 denotes the total length of the domain walls .    \\a .   potts model is given ( left ) as well as a schematic picture for non - integer @xmath0 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   potts model is given ( left ) as well as a schematic picture for non - integer @xmath0 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] + b.   potts model is given ( left ) as well as a schematic picture for non - integer @xmath0 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   potts model is given ( left ) as well as a schematic picture for non - integer @xmath0 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the fundamental geometric object we consider is a connected part of a domain wall that separates two clusters .",
    "one can ask how the probability , that a certain number of such dw connect a small ( in units of the lattice spacing ) neighbourhood @xmath39 to another small neighbourhood @xmath40 , decays when the distance @xmath41 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 increases .",
    "each dw separates two spin clusters which connect @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "there are in fact two types of such dw , depending on the relative colouring of the two clusters that are separated .",
    "if the two clusters have different colours , they can touch , so the dw is _ thin _ ( see fig .  [",
    "dw2types].a ) .",
    "if the two clusters have the same colour , then they can not touch ( otherwise they would not be distinct ) , so the dw has to be _ thick _ ( see fig .  [",
    "dw2types].b ) .",
    "several different geometries are of interest . in the bulk case ,",
    "the neighbourhoods @xmath39 and @xmath40 are at arbitrary , but widely separated , locations in the infinite plane .",
    "this is conformally equivalent to an infinitely long cylinder  a strip with periodic boundary conditions  with @xmath39 and @xmath40 situated at the two extremities . in the boundary case ,",
    "the geometry is that of the upper half plane , with @xmath39 being at the origin and @xmath40 far away from the real axis .",
    "the boundary conditions are taken to be free , fixed or mixed on the positive real axis , and free on the negative real axis .",
    "in other words , the potts spins can take @xmath30 ( resp .",
    "@xmath0 ) values on the positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) real axis .",
    "this geometry is illustrated in fig .",

    "then the probability @xmath43 that the two regions @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with separation @xmath44 , are connected by @xmath4 thin dw and @xmath5 thick dw decays algebraically . in the bulk case ( geometry of the plane )",
    "the corresponding critical exponent is denoted @xmath45 , and we have @xmath46 .",
    "equivalently , on a long cylinder of size @xmath47 with @xmath48 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 identified with the opposite ends of the cylinder , the decay is exponential : @xmath49 .",
    "in the boundary case ( geometry of the half plane ) the critical exponent for free boundary conditions is denoted @xmath50 .",
    "below we check these assertions numerically , and we observe that the numerical values of the exponents match the formulae @xmath51 where we have used the kac parametrisation of cft @xmath52 and @xmath53 parametrises @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "it remains to give our results for the mixed boundary conditions with parameter @xmath30 ( of which fixed boundary conditions corresponds to the special case @xmath55 ) .",
    "these follow by conformal fusion of the free - to - mixed boundary condition changing operator @xmath56 that has been worked out in @xcite with the operator @xmath57 that inserts the required number of dw with free boundary conditions .",
    "details about this will be given below in section  [ sec : mixed ] .",
    "we close this section with two remarks about the precise interpretation of the main result ( [ mainconj ] ) .",
    "first , in the expression ( [ mainconj ] ) for the bulk exponent @xmath58 , the case @xmath59 of a single dw ( which must then necessarily be thick , due to the periodic boundary conditions ) is special . in that case ( [ mainconj ] ) remains valid only if the dw is forbidden to wrap around the neighbourhoods @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( in the geometry of the plane ) , or around the periodic direction ( in the equivalent cylinder geometry ) . without that restriction being imposed , we obtain another result : @xmath60    second , in the boundary case the numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 appearing in ( [ mainconj ] ) must be defined more carefully . indeed ,",
    "when there are @xmath61 propagating spin clusters , only the nature ( ` thin ' or ` thick ' ) or the @xmath62 dw separating them is clear by the above definition , whereas it is not yet clear how to characterise the ` half domain walls ' that separate the two outermost spin clusters from the boundaries .",
    "the correct and unambiguous definition of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is as follows : let the leftmost spin cluster contribute one unit to @xmath4 , and let each of the @xmath62 subsequent spin clusters contribute one unit to @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) if it has a different ( resp .",
    "the same ) colour as the cluster on its left .",
    "the dw expansion ( [ pottsdw ] ) may appear unwieldy and difficult to study numerically for non - integer @xmath0 .",
    "there nevertheless exists several monte carlo methods for studying the potts model when @xmath0 is not an integer @xcite , all of which are roughly speaking based on the fk cluster representation .",
    "it is possible to reconstruct the spin clusters from the chayes - machta algorithm @xcite by performing the bond - adding step at zero temperature .",
    "following our brief account @xcite , this method has very recently been used @xcite to verify a special case of ( [ mainconj ] ) corresponding to @xmath63 ( with wrapping forbidden ) .    as in @xcite",
    "we shall however take a quite different route and resort to a transfer matrix construction .",
    "this has the advantage of linking up more easily with cft @xcite , and giving very precise numerical results for all the boundary conditions outlined above .",
    "moreover , the ensuing transfer matrix formalism is no more complicated than the one @xcite routinely used in the study of the fk clusters .",
    "consider a strip of the square lattice of width @xmath27 spins ( boundary conditions will be detailed later ) .",
    "the basis states on which the row - to - row transfer matrix @xmath64 acts contain one colour label @xmath65 per spin . by definition",
    ", one has @xmath66 if and only if @xmath67 ( i.e. , the two spins on sites @xmath68 and @xmath69 have the same colour ) .",
    "the colour labels @xmath65 contain less information than the spin colours @xmath70 themselves .",
    "for instance , any configuration in which the first and third spins have the same colour , no matter which one , and no other spins have identical colours , is represented by @xmath71{$c_1 $ } ;          \\filldraw ( 0.5,0 ) circle ( 0.7 mm ) node[above]{$c_2 $ } ;          \\filldraw ( 1,0 ) circle ( 0.7 mm ) node[above]{$c_1 $ } ;          \\filldraw ( 1.5,0 ) circle ( 0.7 mm ) node[above]{$c_4 $ } ;          \\draw ( 2,0 ) node{$\\dots$ } ;          \\filldraw ( 2.5,0 ) circle ( 0.7 mm ) node[above]{$c_l$ } ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ] with these conventions we are always able to recognise whether to spins have the same colour or not , even if we do not know the precise value of this colour .",

    "this means that the distinction between thin and thick dw disappears in that limit .",
    "this is of course consistent with the fact that @xmath202 is a fixed point of the duality transformation @xmath203 , and so spin clusters and fk clusters have identical properties .",
    "a further manifestation of the indistinguishability of thin and thick dw is that the bulk exponent ( [ mainconj ] ) becomes @xmath204 indeed , this formula is invariant under the permutation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the exponent for @xmath205 fk clusters reads @xmath206 for @xmath197 @xcite , and so a spin dw ( whether thin or thick ) behaves as a fk cluster , as expected .      for the ising model @xmath22 ( or @xmath207 )",
    "the absense of branchings means that one thick dw equals two thin dw .",

    "the limit @xmath20 ( or @xmath211 ) is often studied in the context of fk clusters , since these become then bond percolation clusters . setting @xmath212 for spin clusters has a more trivial meaning : all the spins are simply in the same state , @xmath213",
    ". therefore we should have @xmath214 and @xmath215 for @xmath20 .",
    "this is indeed satisfied by ( [ res_d ] ) and ( [ res_ds ] ) .",
    "apart from that , the @xmath20 limit for spin clusters is more subtle .",

    "one _ single percolation cluster .",
    "the spins on the vertices sitting on this cluster are given a certain colour .",

    "cluster for @xmath212 on the lattice . for more interfaces",
