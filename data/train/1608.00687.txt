    "as hosts of large - scale service applications , data centers now play a crucial role in modern information technology ( it ) infrastructures . with the development of cloud computing",
    ", data centers are growing exponentially in number and size .",
    "a new study from international data corporation ( idc ) predicts that the total number of data centers deployed worldwide will peak at @xmath0 million in 2017 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the extremely high energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of data centers are becoming a major concern worldwide .",
    "the natural resources defense council ( nrdc ) reported that 91 billion kwh of electricity was consumed by u.s .",
    "data centers in 2013 . continuing this trend , nrdc estimates that the electricity usage will reach 140 billion kwh by 2020 . as a result , data center electricity consumption will cost american businesses $ 13 billion annually in electricity bills and result in the emission of nearly 100 million metric tons of carbon pollution per year @xcite .",
    "globally , it had revealed that power requirements grew by 63% to 38 gigawatts in 2012 , up from 24 gigawatts in 2011 @xcite .",
    "moreover , data centers will consume 8% of the worldwide electricity supply by 2020 while this fraction was about 1.3% in 2010 @xcite .",
    "therefore , making data centers `` green '' can reduce both costs for energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions",
    ".    existing data centers often operate at low utilization because of over - provisioning and fragmentation of resources @xcite , leading to considerable energy waste . according to a mckinsey study in 2008 @xcite ,",
    "the typical utilization ratio is approximately 6% .",
    "a gartner report from 2012 @xcite found the typical utilization rates to be in the 7% to 12% range , slightly better than the result of the 2008 mckinsey study .",
    "recently , google inc . reported that they can improve the utilization of their servers to relatively high rates of 20 - 40% @xcite .",
    "many studies @xcite have also shown that data center networks experience high underutilization , with typical utilization ranging between 5% and 25% .",
    "what makes the matter worse is that the low utilization of these servers and network resources also cause the waste of other supporting infrastructure , such as power distribution and cooling . from these data",
    ", we can see that the present energy efficiency of data centers is extremely low and that there is great potential for reducing energy consumption in data centers .",
    "motivated by the high energy consumption and low utilization of data centers , many research efforts over the past few years have focused on the design of green data center infrastructures and services .",
    "generally , these approaches can be categorized into two major classes @xcite : 1 ) those that adopt `` green '' equipment in the preliminary design and building phase of the data centers , and 2 ) those that increase the efficiency of the daily expenditures incurred during the operation of the data centers . in this paper , we focus on the latter class of methods , i.e. , those that emphasize managing the procedures for running and operating data centers in a `` green '' manner . to this end ,",
    "research studies on the development of green data centers have concentrated on the following aspects : 1 ) decreasing the power consumption of data center resources , 2 ) increasing the utilization of data centers , 3 ) controlling the thermal behavior of data centers , and 4 ) developing green metrics , monitoring and experimental techniques . from the perspective of data center architecture ,",
    "the fundamental components of data centers are 1 ) computing servers , 2 ) connection networks , and 3 ) cooling equipment .",
    "correspondingly , green data center technologies can be applied to a individual component or to a hybrid scheme of components .",
    "although obvious progress has been made in the construction of green data centers over the past decade , there is still a large gap , and therefore a large opportunity for savings , between the current average and the characteristics of a best - practice green data center @xcite . in this paper , we present a survey of the current state - of - the - art research on green data centers , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : an_overview_of_green_data_center_techniques ] .",
    "some recent surveys have conducted on energy - aware resource allocation for cloud computing @xcite or green data center networks @xcite .",
    "different from them , our survey covers many aspects of the development of green data centers .",
    "our main contributions are two - fold : 1 ) we discuss the key insights underlying recent strategies and compare the relevant proposals , and 2 ) we note the future research challenges and directions for various aspects of the design of green data centers .",

    "the research community has proposed a number of possible approaches in recent years .",
    "this scheme , which is also known as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling ( dvfs ) , focuses on lowering the frequency / speed of devices to save energy .",

    "the objective of the simulator was to generate data center configurations for particular purposes , such as cpu sleep - state transitions and dvfs for power management , as well as thermal behavior characterization .",
    "in @xcite , the authors proposed a simulator , named simware , to analyze the power consumption of servers , cooling units , and fans as well as the effects of heat recirculation and air supply timing .",
    "simware considered the time required for air to travel from the cracs to the servers and could evaluate user - defined job scheduling and virtual machine management algorithms .",

    "thus , developing metrics that are well suited for reducing energy consumption is a challenging task with a significant contribution to the construction of `` green '' data centers .",
    "moreover , the monitoring of green metrics in data centers assists in diagnosing energy inefficiencies and in the implementation of proactive mechanisms to improve energy efficiency .",
    "however , this issue has received little attention thus far , and existing monitors have been proposed for either particular architectures @xcite or special applications @xcite .",
    "the challenges are the large number of hosted servers or virtual machines and the availability of communication resources in data centers .",
    "consequently , centralized monitoring techniques suffer from low scalability and elasticity .",
    "monitoring techniques adopted from cooperative monitoring @xcite can be applied to overcome these drawbacks by enabling distributed and robust monitoring solutions for large - scale , complex data centers .",
    "the key research question of interest is how to minimize the costs incurred while guaranteeing monitoring accuracy .    finally ,",
    "although platforms such as greencloud @xcite and gdcsim @xcite have provided data center energy - aware simulation environments , the primary disadvantage of these platforms is that most of them are coarse grained and focused only on certain components or functions .",
    "for example , when a simulation of virtual machine migration considers only cpu resources , the results for virtual machine allocation may suffer from a failure to consider the bandwidth requirements .",
    "therefore , the task of designing a system - wide experimental and simulation platform that integrates all components of a data center , such as the cpu , memory , cache , i / o , disk and communication network , requires further exploration .",
