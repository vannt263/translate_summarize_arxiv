    "as polaritons carry a spin , spinor interactions characterize fundamental physical processes in polariton quantum systems .",
    "this results in anisotropic nonlinearities at the origin of many effects such as stimulated spin dynamics of polaritons @xcite , the transport of spin polarized polaritons @xcite , the optical spin hall effect @xcite , the generation of polarization vortices @xcite and half quantum vortices @xcite , spontaneous polarization buildup in bose - einstein condensation @xcite , in bistability @xcite multistability @xcite and polariton switching @xcite . + despite their importance , the spinor polariton interactions have been determined only indirectly .",
    "several experiments indicate that the interaction of polaritons with anti - parallel spins is attractive @xcite . in others , with the presence of a reservoir it appears to be repulsive @xcite .",
    "furthermore , theoretical works predict that spinor polariton interaction strengths depend on the cavity detuning @xcite .",
    "it is very important to note that each investigation uses its own experimental condition : resonant or non - resonant excitation , different cavity detuning and time scale , which influences in the measurement and then in the determination of the interaction constants .",
    "furthermore , previous studies concentrate on the lower polariton behavior omitting the upper polariton branch .",
    "+ in this work , we report on the study of lower and upper polariton energy renormalization in function of the polariton density and the exciton - photon cavity detuning in semiconductor microcavity . to carry out this investigation , we concentrate on the lower and upper polariton resonances through spectrally resolved pump - probe spectroscopy .",
    "we employ pump - probe pulse co- and counter - circular polarization configurations in order to investigate polariton - polariton interactions with parallel and anti - parallel spins , respectively .",
    "the results reveal either the repulsive or attractive character of the spinor polariton interactions through the measured energy shift of the probed lower and upper polariton resonances .",

    "we use a pump - probe setup with both pump and probe 125 femtosecond pulses from a ti : sapphire laser .",
    "the center energy of the laser spectrum ( the linewidth is 14.6 mev ) is set between lower and upper polaritons , therefore the laser intensity is fixed for all cavity detunings .",
    "the experiments are performed under resonant excitation and at 4k .",
    "+ we employ a heterodyne pump - probe technique @xcite .",
    "the laser beam is split into three : the pump and probe are frequency shifted with acousto - optic modulators ( aom ) by 75 mhz and 79mhz , respectively , and focused on the sample . in transmission",
    ", the probe signal is directed into an aom together with the reference beam .",
    "the aom , driven at 79 mhz , produces two @xmath7-shifted detection channels in which the reference and probe signal overlap spectrally .",
    "the mixed beams are dispersed in a spectrometer and we subtract the two @xmath7-shifted interferograms to recover the pump - probe signal .",
    "this heterodyne pump - probe technique allows us to study the polariton interactions close to degenerate beams configuration at k = 0 and dramatically increases the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this enables a precise measurement of small energy shifts in the probe spectrum .",
    "the experimental setup is described in detail in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "+ the principle of the experiment is the following : we generate a spin up lower and upper polariton population with a @xmath8 circularly polarized pump pulse . by varying the power of the pump pulse we control the spin - up polariton population . a small amount of spin - up or -down lower and upper polaritons",
    "is then injected with a weak @xmath8 or @xmath9 circularly polarized probe pulse .",
    "we spectrally probe the energy of the lower and the upper polariton resonance by measuring the transmission spectrum of the probe pulse . + the strength of the spinor polariton interaction is determined from a renormalized energy shift of the polariton resonance due to the presence of the pump polaritons .",
    "if the spinor polariton interaction is repulsive , it shows a blueshift , otherwise a redshift appears for attractive interaction .",
    "the experiments are performed at different cavity detunings to highlight the role of the excitonic content on the polariton - polariton interactions .",

    "+ the pump - probe spectra clearly show a blueshift of both the lower and upper polariton resonances in co - circular configuration , while for counter - circular measurements they show a redshift .",
    "these results also show that , as the polariton density is increased , the polariton resonance energy shift increases . in order to extract the energy shifts of the polariton resonance quantitatively ,",

    "the results show that the blueshifted for both resonance increases with polariton density and varies with cavity detuning .",
    "this evidences the repulsive interaction between polariton with parallel spin for all cavity detuning .",
    "notice the `` mirror '' behavior of the upper - lower polariton energy shift with cavity detuning .",
    "this reflects the role of the excitonic content of polariton states on polariton - polariton interactions .",
    "indeed , for negative detuning the upper polariton being more excitonic - like than lower polariton , presents larger blueshift .",
    "the reverse is valid for positive detuning .",
    "+ we would like to mention that the mirror symmetry axis is not at zero detuning but appears around @xmath15 mev .",
    "we might attribute this behavior to an onset of upper polariton scattering into an exciton reservoir .",
    "actually , to compensate this depopulation , the upper polariton resonance needs to be more excitonic to experience energy shift comparable to the lower polariton .          for the same set of polariton densities as above",
    ", we display the dependence of the upper and the lower polariton energy shifts with cavity detuning in figure [ cross](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the lower and upper polariton resonances are red shifted and this shift increases with polariton density .",
    "this result signs the attractive interaction between polariton with anti - parallel spin .",
    "the influence of the excitonic content of the polaritons for the interactions is again evidenced . eventually , for lower polaritons , the energy shift increases from negative to positive cavity detunings .",
    "the reverse happens for the energy shift of the upper polaritons .",
    "+ however , the dependence of the upper polariton energy shift with cavity detuning is not a `` mirror '' image of the lower polariton as for the results presented for parallel spins . here",
    ", the lower polaritons undergo a much stronger energy shift than the upper polaritons . actually , the lower polariton energy renormalization is not only due to polariton - polariton interaction but also due to polariton - biexciton coupling .",
    "it is important to note that for the lower polaritons from negative to positive cavity detuning , the energy of two - lower polaritons approaches the energy of the biexciton resonance .",
    "this effect highlights the influence of the biexciton on the lower polariton energy renormalization for anti - parallel spin polariton interactions .",
    "this result is in agreement with the polaritonic feshbach resonance behavior recently observed @xcite corroborating that biexcitons play a crucial role in the anti - parallel spin polariton interactions .",
    "since our experimental approach consists of the excitation of both lower and upper polariton states in the nonlinear regime , cross interactions between polariton modes might appear leading to an hazardous description of our results in the polariton basis .",
    "therefore , we use the exciton - photon based gross - pitaevskii equation to reproduce the experimental observations . comparing the simulation to the experimental data will allow us to extract the spinor interaction constants in the exciton - photon basis hamiltonian . in section",
    "v , we will show how to transpose our analysis in the lower polariton basis yielding a comparison to previously reported results .",

    "+ it might be worth commenting the microscopic origin of these phenomenological interaction constants . to be precise ,",
    "excitons are composite bosons composed of electron - hole pairs , thus exciton - exciton interactions are governed by coulomb interaction between electrons and holes . the simplest approach to calculate exciton - exciton interaction with parallel spins",
    "@xmath27 is to calculate scattering matrix of excitons based on the born approximation @xcite . according to this calculation , in zero momentum scattering , which is the case of our experiment ,",
    "the main contribution to the exciton - exciton interaction is electron - hole exchange interaction .",
    "however , this calculation can not explain the existence of the exciton interaction with anti - parallel spins , because the exchange interaction disappears between excitons between anti - parallel spins @xcite .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of biexciton state ( @xmath30 in our model ) and the calculation beyond the born approximation are important to explain the exciton interaction with anti - parallel spins @xcite . for example",
    ", such a calculation has been done by @xcite through the summation of higher orders of scattering matrix including biexciton state .",
    "firstly , their result shows that the biexciton boundstate introduces resonance scattering for exciton interaction with anti - parallel spins .",
    "second , the inclusion of the higher - order scattering matrices results in a strong modification of the exciton - exciton interaction both for parallel and anti - parallel excitons ( called `` continuum correlations '' @xcite ) .",
    "this continuum correlations might microscopically explain the necessity of the exciton - exciton interaction with anti - parallel spins @xmath28 , but the investigation of the exciton - exciton interaction starting from electron - hole basis is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "+ in our model , the phase space filling effect is omitted due to its weak contribution .",
    "based on the result of @xcite , the exchange interaction of excitons with parallel spins @xmath31 and the contribution from phase space filling @xmath32 can be estimated as @xmath33 ( in the born approximation ) and @xmath34 . here @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively represent elementary charge and dielectric constant of the quantum wells .",

    ", we obtain a ratio @xmath43 .",
    "this ratio indicates that the coulomb term is the dominant contribution to the repulsive interaction of polaritons with parallel spins in our sample . + using the heisenberg equation of motion and mean field approximation @xcite , we obtain the equations of motion for the exciton , photon and biexciton . in this hamiltonian",
    ", biexcitons are created from spin - up and spin - down excitons , which indicates that counter - circular polarization configuration is mandatory to induce the biexciton effect @xcite .",
    "the exciton , photon and biexciton wavefunctions are described by the following exciton - photon gross - pitaevskii equation system :    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are respectively exciton , photon and biexciton decay rate . in the numerical calculation , we use @xmath50 mev .",

    "the dynamics of the set of wavefunctions @xmath60 @xcite can be described as @xmath61 .",
    "the matrix @xmath62 is given by    @xmath63    since the lower and upper polaritons are excited with spectrally broad femtosecond pulse , we model the pump and probe photon pulses as instantaneous delta function pulses exciting the system simultaneously . by fourier",
    "transforming the temporal photon probe wavefunctions , we obtain the spectra of the light emitted out of the cavity . subtracting the pump - probe spectra from the reference spectra",
    ", we single out the energy shift of both lower and upper polariton resonances due to the presence of the pump pulse . the strength of our method to extract spinor interaction constants is based on the joint comparison of lower and upper polariton energy shifts .",

    "the experimental results are well reproduced : the lower polaritons show an increase of the energy shift from negative to positive cavity detuning , while the upper polariton s energy shift decreases .",
