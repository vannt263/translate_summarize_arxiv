    "kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft ) is at present one of the most powerful computational tools in quantum chemistry , solid - state physics , and materials science .",
    "therefore , it is continuously subject to intense research . in particular , the development of new improved exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals @xcite , which are a main ingredient of the ks self - consistent one - particle equations @xcite , and that account for all the quantum many - body effects beyond the hatree approximation , has been for many years , and still is , the main topic in this field .",
    "the construction of xc functionals can be pursued in several different ways @xcite , but in any case a prominent role is played by the availability of reference systems used to target the functional development . in this context particularly useful are model systems , which allow to control in a simple way specific features of the physics of electronic systems , and thus to reduce the empiricism . among the others we can mention the uniform electron gas @xcite , which is the basic model for solid - state physics and the base of all non - empirical semilocal xc functionals @xcite ; the airy gas @xcite and jellium surfaces @xcite , that describe the physics of simple metal surfaces and",
    "were used to develop generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) for solids ( am05 @xcite , pbesol @xcite ) and interfaces ( pbeint @xcite ) ; the hydrogen atom , which is a basic model for atomic physics and was successfully employed , through the analysis of the xc hole , to construct accurate meta - gga approximations @xcite ; the semiclassical many - electron neutral atom @xcite that was used to obtain a modified second - order gradient expansion for both the kinetic @xcite and exchange energy @xcite , which are at the base of accurate xc gga for molecular systems ( apbe @xcite ) , as well kinetic energy ggas constructed for the embedding theory of weakly - interacting molecular systems @xcite .",
    "recently , we also proposed @xcite a constraint for atomization energies at the gga level , based on a model system constituted by a statistical ensemble of one - electron densities . in particular , we considered the reference one - electron hydrogen ( h ) , gaussian ( g ) , and cuspless ( c ) densities ( atomic units are used throughout , i.e. , @xmath2 ) @xmath3 and we showed that the accuracy of a gga xc functional to describe cohesive properties is directly related to the information - entropy - like function @xcite @xmath4=-\\sum_{i } p_ir_i\\ln(p_ir_i),\\;\\;\\;i = h,\\ ; g,\\ ; \\ ; \\rm{and } \\",

    "@xcite ) ; and from the physical explanation that one - electron densities are simple models for simple bonding regions , where iso - orbital regime can be significant .",
    "( see fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the corresponding discussion . )",
    "this constraint was used to improve the description of cohesive energies of finite - size and periodic systems by gga functionals of pbe - like form @xcite through the use of a spin - dependent xc correction based on the ansatz @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the lda exchange and correlation energies per particle ; @xmath10 is the exchange enhancement factor ; @xmath11 is the pbe - like gradient correction for the correlation ; @xmath12 is a spin - scaling factor that lays between 1 ( for spin - unpolarized systems ) and @xmath13 ( for fully spin polarized systems ) and @xmath14 is the relative spin polarization ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the reduced gradients for exchange and correlation respectively @xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the local fermi wavevector , and @xmath19 being the thomas - fermi screening wavevector ; finally the following spin - dependent correction has been selected @xcite : @xmath20 which satisfies important physical constraints @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 was obtained by the minimization of @xmath22 $ ] , yielding the zpbesol and zpbeint gga functionals @xcite , having gga = pbesol , @xmath23 and gga = pbeint , @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we underline that , as for most dft functionals @xcite , the ansatzes of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 5 ) were not derived directly from exact equations / conditions , but are constructed with the aim to fulfill all the exact constraints for the original gga and additionally , the atomization energy constraint , derived in ref .",
    "thus , the spin - dependent correction can be viewed as an ad hoc correction for the whole xc functional , that can be applied to ggas constructed for solids ( see fig .",
    "[ 22 ] ) .    by construction the functionals",
    "keep unchanged the behavior of the original functionals ( pbesol and pbeint ) for spin - unpolarized systems , and they significantly improve the atomization energies of molecules and solids @xcite .",
    "in fact , the ansatz of eqs .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e5 ] ) preserves many important constraints of the original ggas , including the spin - scaling behavior of the xc functional in the slowly - varying density limit @xcite , and in addition enforce the atomization energy constraint .",
    "note also that the spin - dependent correction of eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) only acts in the rapidly - varying density regime , where the exact spin - dependence of the correlation is not known and the pbe - like functionals assume the spin dependence of the second - order gradient expansion @xcite .",
    "despite their good behavior , however the zpbeint and zpbesol functionals display some non - negligible formal drawbacks related to the form used for the spin - dependent correction ( eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) ) .",
    "in particular , because the correction is aimed at improving the bonding description , it should act only in the valence regions of the electron density . on the other hand , as it will be discussed in this paper ,",
    "it turns out that in atomic inter - shell regions @xmath16 can be large so that , even if @xmath25 is close to 1 ( as in the whole core region ) , the spin - dependent correction may be ( inappropriately ) important .    in this paper",
    ", we consider in more detail the construction proposed in ref . and develop a new spin - dependent ansatz , beyond the form of eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) , which is able to implement the constraint of our statistical set of one - particle densities removing the previous limitation . to this end",
    "we introduce a new density parameter more convenient for atomization energies , and additional constraints from partially spin - polarized one electron densities .",
    "moreover , using the new ansatz we demonstrate the utility of a spin - dependent correction beyond the gga level , applying our spin - dependent factor to improve the compatibility of meta - gga correlation functionals with the exact - exchange ( exx ) .",
    "this article is organized as follow : in section [ sec3 ] we propose an improved ansatz for the spin - dependent correction , which is based on a new reduced density parameter ; in section [ sec4 ] we show the results of several gga functionals bearing the spin - dependent correction , for atomization and binding energies , as well for other properties ; in section [ sec5 ] we develop spin - dependent corrections for meta - gga correlation functionals , that allows a better compatibility with the exact exchange , improving the atomization energies by about 30% , and finally , in section [ sec6 ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "let us consider , instead of @xmath26 a more general form for the spin - dependent correction factor to be used in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants which will be fixed from exact constraints , and @xmath30 is the relative spin polarization ( @xmath31 for fully - spin - polarized systems , and @xmath32 for spin - unpolarized systems ) . here",
    ", @xmath33 is a generalized spin - independent density parameter for which we use the general ansatz @xmath34 with @xmath35 a parameter to be fixed from one - electron density analysis .",
    "note that the form of eq .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) assures that @xmath33 can describe the density regime with good flexibility .",
    "in particular , when @xmath36 we have @xmath37 , while for @xmath38 we find @xmath39 .",
    "the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) satisfies the following exact properties ( as the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) :    \\(i ) at a constant density @xmath40 , thus @xmath41 , and eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) correctly recovers the lda behavior .",
    "\\(ii ) for a slowly - varying density , @xmath33 is small and thus @xmath42 , i.e. with a third power in the gradient of the density . in this way the corrected gga of eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , performs exactly as the original pbe - like correlation one ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) for any spin - unpolarized system ( @xmath32 everywhere ) or regions of space where @xmath32 , there is no spin - dependent correction ( @xmath44 ) , and thus the corrected gga of eq .",

    "thus xc - energy density in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) with the spin - dependent correction in eq .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) satisfies the _ same _ physical constrains as the original pbesol ( pbeint ) .",
    "in addition the spin - dependent correction in eq . ( [ e14 ] ) is constructed so that @xmath45 only in rapidly - varying spin - polarized density regime ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) , where no exact constraints are know . in this regime the total correlation energy density of our corrected functional ( i.e. @xmath48 ) will be larger ( more negative ) than the original pbe - like correlation and can thus partially compensate the underestimated contribution of pbesol ( pbeint ) exchange functional @xcite .    concerning the relation between the new ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) and the one in eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) , we note that the latter can be rewritten as @xmath49 . for small spin - polarizations ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) , we have @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for @xmath36 and @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the new ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) is equivalent to the one of eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) with @xmath54 and @xmath36 ( @xmath21 is a constant ) .",
    "this equivalence is trivially valid also for fully polarized systems ( as the model one - electron densities in the statistical ensemble ) : in fact in this case @xmath55 and @xmath56 so that @xmath57 is just a constant , @xmath58 and again @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath16 for @xmath36 .    the main advantage of eq .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) with respect to eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) is that the dependence of the correction factor @xmath59 from the spin- and spatial - properties of the density is decoupled and controlled respectively by the @xmath60 factor and the density parameter @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , a fine tuning of the correction is possible to make it relevant only in valence and bonding regions .    to fix the parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) and ( [ e15 ] ) , we note that for fully - spin - polarized systems @xmath61 , thus the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath35 can be found from the one - electron - densities statistical ensemble , by minimization of the information - entropy - like function .",
    "to perform such minimization , the form of the gga functional entering eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) must be fixed . as in ref .",
    ", we consider in the present case gga = pbeint and gga = pbesol , obtaining @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 for pbeint and pbesol , respectively .",
    "( defined in eq .",
    "( [ e16 ] ) ) for pbe , pbesol , pbeint , and wu - cohen gga @xcite . ]    the minimization procedure for @xmath35 is also indicated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , where we plot the function @xmath65\\ , \\ ] ] for several popular functionals .",
    "the functionals constructed for solids and interfaces ( pbesol , pbeint , and wu - cohen @xcite ) show a similar trend with @xmath35 : the value of @xmath66 is large for @xmath67 , that represents the spin correction @xmath68 ; for @xmath36 , corresponding to @xmath69 , i.e. the previous ansatz used in zpbesol and zpbeint , it is significantly smaller and close to the absolute minimum ; at @xmath62 , all three curves minimize the function @xmath70 . for functionals more accurate for atomization energies , as pbe ,",
    "the spin - dependent correction is not important ( and thus @xmath70 is almost constant ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "we note at this point that the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) used to define the density parameter @xmath33 and the value @xmath62 , obtained from the minimization procedure , are important outcomes that go beyond the optimization of the parameters of the model given by eq .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) .",
    "thus , the minimization of @xmath70 allows us to define the density parameter @xmath71 with @xmath72 , being indeed a physically meaningful quantity to describe density variations in valence and bonding regions .",
    "in fact , unlike @xmath15 and @xmath16 which were derived in the slowly - varying density limit , @xmath33 was derived from the statistical constraint involving the one - electron densities , which are characterized by a rapidly - varying regime and connected to cohesive energies of different systems . moreover , fig .",
    "[ kplot ] shows that , in agreement with the indications of wave vector analysis on jellium surface energies @xcite , @xmath73 and the ratio @xmath74 provide small values of the wave vector in the high - density regions ( small @xmath75 ) and relatively large values ( @xmath76 ) in valence and bonding regions ( @xmath77 ) , thus granting a good sensitivity for density variations in a broad range of @xmath75 values , and a superior description ( e.g. with respect to @xmath78 ) of high wave - vector contributions in low - density valence and bonding regions .",
    "dependence of wave vectors @xmath79 , @xmath78 , and @xmath73 on the seitz radius @xmath75 ( a.u . )",
    ". the bottom panel reports the ratio of wavevectors @xmath78 and @xmath73 with @xmath80 . ]",
    "wavevector analyses for the correlation energies have been performed only for very simple systems , as jellium surfaces @xcite and hooke s atom @xcite . for such systems ,",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) fails at large wavevectors ( @xmath81 ) , whereas the semilocal functionals performs good ( see fig .",
    "9 of ref . ) , but there is still room for improvement @xcite .",
    "we also recall that the langreth and mehl gga @xcite , which was one of the first semilocal functionals beyond the gradient expansion , is based on the wavevector decomposition of the xc energy .",
    "@xmath73 , which was found from one - electron analysis ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and agrees well with the thomas - fermi wave vector ( @xmath78 ) ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , is more sensitive in rapidly - varying regions .",
    "thus , the density parameter @xmath33 and the local wave vector @xmath73 , measuring the range of density variations important for bonding properties , can be regarded as important ingredients in functional development and further work shall be planned to fully assess their importance in this context ( beyond the present spin - dependent correction ) .",
    "the factor of 3 that enters the @xmath33 expression was chosen only for convenience , i.e. for any @xmath35 , the parameter @xmath21 which minimizes @xmath22 $ ] to be between 0 and 2 .",
    "in fact , the minimization of @xmath70 can define the density parameter @xmath33 up to a constant , that later may be fixed from a theory of rapidly - varying density regions .",
    "nevertheless , the here defined @xmath73 performs similarly with @xmath78 in a broad range of density regimes ( see fig .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 could not be fixed from a minimization of the statistical - entropy - like function , because for fully spin - polarized systems the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) does not depend on @xmath60 .",
    "we must therefore introduce additional constraints based on partially polarized model systems .",
    "to this end we consider the uniformly spin - polarized gaussian densities @xmath82 that are models for the electronic localization in wigner crystals and in bonding regions of organic molecules @xcite , and were already employed to fix constraints in the development of meta - gga functionals @xcite .",
    "the following conditions are imposed : @xmath83 where the first condition shall guarantee that the spin - dependent correction does nt modifies the original functional in the core region of spin - polarized atoms ( where @xmath84 ) while the second one requires the ggas using the new spin - dependent correction to be the same as the previous zggas ( i.e. zpbesol or zpbeint ) , whose behavior at large @xmath30 had been proved to be remarkably good @xcite .",
    "we find that for both cases considered here ( gga = pbeint and pbesol ) the optimum value of @xmath60 is 9/2 .",
    "thus , we can finally define two non - empirical functionals making use of the spin - dependent correction of eq .",

    "[ fig3 ] we also plot the behavior of the pbesol spin - dependent correction , and the deviation from pbesol of the correlation energy density , versus the radial distance in n atom . as expected , the zvpbesol improves over zpbesol in the core region of the atom , being smooth and very close to the original pbesol curve , thanks to its smaller derivative around @xmath32 . in the valence and tail regions , on the other hand , zpbesol and zvpbesol",
    "perform rather similarly ( by construction ) and decrease significantly the correlation with respect to pbesol .",
    "finally , we stress that the corrected functionals ( zvpbesol and zvpbeint ) fulfill all the exact constraints of the original functionals and additionally satisfy the new xc constraint for atomization energies .",
    "the lieb - oxford bound @xcite @xmath91 , is locally recovered by the exchange part of the functionals , and is globally recovered by the full xc functionals ( in the same manner as pbe and pbesol ) , because @xmath92 ( see table s12 in the supplementary material ) .",
    "in this section we report the results of the application of the zvpbeint and zvpbesol functionals to the calculation of the atomization energies and other properties of several systems . in detail",
    ", we consider the atomization energies of organic molecules ( ae6 @xcite and w4 @xcite tests ) , transition - metal complexes ( tm10ae test @xcite ) , and small gold clusters ( aunae test @xcite ) .",
    "note that for all these systems , especially for those of the tm10ae test , the atomization / interaction energies are obtained as energy differences between species with different spin - polarization .",
    "thus , they constitute a natural test for the functionals developed in the previous section which carry a spin - dependent correction aiming at improving cohesive and interaction energies .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned properties , we considered also different properties of spin - polarized systems in order to verify , in analogy with ref .",
    ", that the spin - dependent correction does not worsen significantly properties other than cohesive ones , for which it was designed . namely , we considered the binding energies of small organic molecules to gold microclusters ( small - interface ( si7 ) test @xcite ) , as a model for spin - polarized hybrid interfaces , equilibrium bond lengths of open - shell organic molecules ( bl9 test @xcite ) and transition - metal complexes ( tm10bl test @xcite ) , kinetic properties of small organic reactions ( k9 test @xcite ) , the spin - states calculations of table ii of ref . , collected in the @xmath93 test ( iron @xcite and cobalt @xcite complexes ) , and the mean absolute errors on the total xc energies of several spin - polarized atoms and molecules @xcite ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) .    the results are reported in table [ tab1 ] as well as in ref . .",

    "on the other hand , z- and zv - type functionals perform rather similarly , although generally a small improvement is obtained with the zv - construction with respect to the corresponding z - type functionals ( except for the w4 test ) .",

    "thus we can conclude that our spin - dependent correction , aimed at improving atomization energies , does not introduce significant artifacts that might alter the description of the spin - polarized systems .    in particular , for the @xmath93 test ( energy differences between spin states )",
    "all ggas perform badly , with a slightly better performance of z - type functionals , that in fact is due to their ( undesirable ) behavior in the core of atoms .",
    "this test is a hard case for any conventional dft approach as it is related with problems with the description of a multireference character by the ks reference system and static correlation issues @xcite .",
    "the spin - dependent correction for atomization energies can not be expected therefore to provide any relevant improvement for this property .",
    "we also recall that for relative energies of different spin - states of metal complexes the pbe exchange is known to provide a very poor performance , while much better results are achieved by employing the pbe correlation functional in conjunction with the optx @xcite exchange @xcite .",
    "thus , we believe that the non - empirical zvpbeint , which is accurate for energetical and structural properties of paramagnetic bulk solids , hybrid interfaces , molecules , as well for surface energies of semi - infinite jellium and of simple metals @xcite , can have a broad applicability .",
    "in this last section we consider the possibility to apply the ansatz of eq .",

    "however it will not be related to the atomization energies through the information - entropy - like function of eq .",

    "the idea of the present work is to improve the compatibility of tpss / tpssloc with exact exchange by using the spin - dependent correction @xmath98 to provide a further localization of the correlation energy density for spin - polarized densities . here the same spin - dependent correction factor of eq .",

    "the exchange functionals constructed for solids and hybrid interfaces ( xpbesol and xpbeint ) , have localized holes @xcite and thus they are not accurate for atoms , overestimating the atomic exchange energies .",
    "so , the spin - dependent correction , based on the h , g , and c ensemble , improves the xc energies of one - electron systems , by making a necessary delocalization of the spin - dependent correlation hole @xcite . on the other hand , at the exx+meta - gga level , one electron densities are exactly described , and because the exx hole is delocalized , the dynamical correlation part should be more localized .    to test",
    "the zvtpss and zvtpssloc functionals we applied them to compute atomization energies ( ae6 test @xcite ) , barrier heights ( bh6 test @xcite ) and reaction kinetic properties ( k9 test@xcite ) of small organic systems .",
    "more extensive tests on larger systems are instead not considered , because in our treatment we do not account for non - dynamical correlation , so that only energy properties of simple small systems at equilibrium geometry can be computed at present .",
    "we recall in addition that for spin - unpolarized systems the zvtpss and zvtpssloc perform exactly as the original tpss and tpssloc functionals , so we did not consider tests involving only spin - unpolarized species ( e.g. non - bonded interactions ) .",

    "full results are reported in ref . .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     from an inspection of the table appears clearly that the zv - corrected correlation functionals have a significantly higher compatibility with exact exchange and provide much improved results with respect to the original tpss and tpssloc functionals .",
    "in particular , the zvtpssloc functional , joining the spatial localization of the correlation energy density and the spin - dependent correction , provides in all cases the smallest errors , with maes of atomization energies comparable with those of pbe and very small errors for barrier heights and the k9 test .",
    "in conclusion , we have discussed in detail the gga spin - dependent correction of ref .",
    ", for atomization energies . from an analysis the one - electron statistical ensemble ( h , g , and c ) , we have found a density parameter @xmath1 for the valence and tail density regions , whose wave vector @xmath121 , seems the next term is a wavevector series , where the first two terms are @xmath122 ( compatible with exchange ) , and @xmath123 ( compatible with yukawa interaction @xcite in the slowly - varying high - density limit ) .    by using the density parameter @xmath33",
    ", we propose a simpler gga spin - dependent correction , constructed to be relevant only in the valence and tail regions , where the spin polarization is important .",
    "the here proposed ggas ( zvpbesol and zvpbeint ) systematically improve the atomization and binding energies of molecular systems with respect pbesol and pbeint , preserving the accuracy of the original functionals for other properties , and thus achieving a broader applicability .",
    "the results of table i , show that the zvpbeint functional performs remarkably well for energetical and structural properties of transition metals , being more accurate than the apbe gga reference , and thus they can be considered in applications of transition metal chemistry , where popular functionals ( including hybrids ) give a modest behavior .    the z- and zv-",
    "functionals , perform similarly for atomization and binding energies , but better results are found from zv- type , especially for the pbeint case . on the other hand , for other properties ,",
    "the zv- functionals are closer to the original ones ( by construction ) .",
    "the construction of non - empirical ggas with broad applicability ( i.e. , accurate for molecules , bulk solids and surfaces ) , is of great theoretical and practical interest .",
    "recent work proved that non - empirical ggas can not be both accurate for atoms and solids @xcite , despite highly empirical gga functionals demonstrated a good accuracy for a broad range of problems @xcite .",
    "thus , the development of non - empirical gga functionals with broad applicability , is a theoretical challenge in dft . in this work",
    "we have shown that the spin - dependent correction ( applied to satisfy the statistical condition for atomization energies , and other physical conditions derived from model systems ) , may be one path through solving this challenge .",
    "we have also applied the spin - dependent correction to meta - ggas dynamical correlation functionals , showing a significantly better compatibility with the exx .",
    "in fact , the zv - corrected meta - ggas improve more than 30% over the original ones , for atomization energies .",
    "thus , we believe that the zvtpssloc meta - gga correlation functional , that is accurate for jellium surfaces , and hooke s atom at any frequency @xcite , can be a good starting point in the development of more accurate ( and non - empirical ) hyper - ggas @xcite .    finally , in this paper , we have shown that the spin - dependent correction of ref .",
    ", which was simplified and improved in this work , is a powerful tool at gga and meta - gga levels .",
    "thus , we believe that it can be used also to functionals that describe the dimensional crossover ( from 3d to 2d ) of the xc energy @xcite , in order to improve the atomization and binding energies of molecular systems under a 2d confinement .",
