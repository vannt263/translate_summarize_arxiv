    "ordinary matter is composed of electrons ( negatively charged ) and nuclei ( positively charged ) interacting via coulomb forces .",
    "the potential between two such particles of charges @xmath8 and @xmath9 located at @xmath10 and @xmath11 in @xmath1 is @xmath12 there are two difficulties which occur when trying to describe systems composed of electrons and nuclei . both have to do with the physical problem of _ stability _ of quantum systems .",
    "the first is due to the singularity of @xmath13 at @xmath14 : it is necessary to explain why a particle will not rush to a particle of the opposite charge .",
    "one of the first major triumphs of the theory of quantum mechanics is the explanation it gives of the stability of the hydrogen atom ( and the complete description of its spectrum ) and of other microscopic quantum coulomb systems .",
    "quantum mechanics or more precisely the uncertainty principle explains not only the stability of tiny microscopic objects , but also the stability of gigantic stellar objects such as white dwarfs .",
    "chandrasekhar s famous theory on the stability of white dwarfs required , however , not only the usual uncertainty principle , but also the pauli exclusion principle for the fermionic electrons .    both the stability of hydrogen and the stability of white dwarfs simply mean that the total energy of the system can not be arbitrarily negative .",
    "if there was no such lower bound to the energy one would have a system from which it would be possible in principle to extract an infinite amount of energy .",
    "one often refers to this kind of stability as _ stability of the first kind _ @xcite .",
    "if we denote by @xmath15 the ground state energy of the system under consideration , for @xmath16 particles , stability of the first kind can be written @xmath17    in proving for coulomb systems , a major role is played by the uncertainty principle which is mathematically expressed by the critical sobolev embedding @xmath18 .",
    "the latter allows to prove kato s inequality @xmath19 for all @xmath20 , which means that the coulomb potential is controlled by the kinetic energy .",
    "the second issue concerns the slow decay of @xmath13 at infinity and this has to do with the macroscopic behavior of quantum coulomb systems .",
    "it is indeed necessary to explain how a very large number of electrons and nuclei can stay bounded together to form macroscopic systems , although each particle interacts with a lot of other charged particles due to the long tail of the coulomb interaction potential .",
    "whereas both the stability of atoms and the stability of white dwarfs were early triumphs of quantum mechanics it , surprisingly , took nearly forty years before the question of stability of everyday macroscopic objects was even raised ( see fisher and ruelle @xcite ) .",
    "the rigorous answer to the question came shortly thereafter in what came to be known as the theorem on stability of matter proved first by dyson and lenard @xcite .",
    "the main question is how the lowest possible energy @xmath15 appearing in depends on the ( macroscopic ) number @xmath16 of particles in the object .",
    "more precisely , one is interested in proving a behavior of the form @xmath21 this behavior as the number of particles grows is mandatory to explain why matter does not collapse or explode in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "assume that does not hold and that for instance @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath24 becomes very large as @xmath25 .",
    "depending on @xmath26 and the sign of the constant @xmath27 , a very large amount of energy will be either released when two identical systems are put together , or necessary to assemble them",
    ". the constant @xmath28 in is interpreted as the energy per particle .    stability of matter is itself a necessary first step towards a proof of as it can be expressed by the lower bound : @xmath29 put differently , the lowest possible energy calculated per particle can not be arbitrarily negative as the number of particles increases .",
    "this is also often referred to as _ stability of the second kind _ @xcite .",
    "a maybe more intuitive notion of stability would be to ask for the volume occupied by a macroscopic object . or more precisely , what is the volume of the object when its total energy is close to the lowest possible",
    ". it can be shown in general that this properly defined volume is proportional to the number of particles @xmath16 . denoting by @xmath30 a domain in @xmath1 which is occupied by the system under consideration and by @xmath31 its ( lowest possible ) energy ,",
    "then reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the volume of @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , stability of the second kind is then expressed as @xmath34    large quantum coulomb systems have been the object of an important investigation in the last decades and many techniques have been developed . a result like ( or equivalently )",
    "was first proved for quantum electrons and nuclei by dyson and lenard @xcite .",
    "after the original proof by dyson and lenard several other proofs were given .",
    "lieb and thirring  @xcite in particular presented an elegant and simple proof relying on an uncertainty principle for fermions .",
    "the different techniques and results concerning stability of matter were reviewed for instance in @xcite .",
    "it is very important that the negatively charged particles ( the electrons ) are fermions .",
    "it was discovered by dyson in @xcite that the pauli exclusion principle is essential for stability of coulomb systems : charged bosons are alone not stable because their ground state energy satisfies @xmath35 , see @xcite .",
    "a result like ( or equivalently ) was first proved for quantum coulomb systems by lieb and lebowitz in @xcite for a system containing electrons and nuclei both considered as dynamic quantum particles , hence in particular invariant under rotations .",
    "later fefferman gave a different proof @xcite for the case where the nuclei are fixed particles placed on a lattice , a system which is not invariant under rotations .    instead of the ground state energy",
    ", one can similarly consider the free energy @xmath36 at temperature @xmath37 and chemical potential @xmath38 .",
    "a precise definition of this quantity will be provided for the three examples that we shall consider in @xcite .",
    "one is interested in proving the equivalent of @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the free energy per unit volume . the pressure is then given by @xmath41 .    in this work ,",
    "we provide a new insight in the study of the thermodynamic limit of quantum systems , by giving a general proof of or which can be applied to many different quantum systems including those studied by lieb and lebowitz in @xcite or fefferman in @xcite . our goal was to identify the main physical properties of the free energy which are sufficient to prove the existence of the thermodynamic limit . for this reason",
    ", this first paper will be dedicated to the study of an abstract energy @xmath42 defined on all open bounded subsets of @xmath1 with values in @xmath43 , for which the limit @xmath44 holds as @xmath4 . in principle",
    ", @xmath0 can represent the ground state energy or the free energy at temperature @xmath45 of any quantum ( or even classical ) system .",
    "we shall apply our general framework to several quantum coulomb systems in another paper in the second paper @xcite will be denoted as @xmath46 . ]",
    "more precisely , we shall treat in @xcite three different systems :    * the quantum crystal for which the nuclei are fixed particles on a lattice , with a possible local rearrangement and local defects ; * dynamic quantum nuclei and electrons in a periodic magnetic field ; * optimized classical nuclei with quantum electrons .    like in previous works ,",
    "our method consists in first showing the existence of the limit for a specific domain @xmath47 which is dilated ( and possibly rotated and translated ) .",
    "usually @xmath47 is chosen to be a ball , a cube or a tetrahedron . in the applications @xcite we always use a tetrahedron",
    "as we shall heavily rely on an inequality proved by graf and schenker @xcite for this type of domains , see proposition ii.[prop_graf_schenker ] .",
    "the second step consists in showing the existence of the limit for any ( reasonable ) sequence of domains @xmath48 such that @xmath4 .",
    "this is important as in principle the limit could depend on the chosen sequence , a fact that we want to exclude for our systems .",
    "here we do not specify what a `` reasonable '' sequence is but some properties will need to be assumed to ensure that boundary effects always stay negligible .",
    "it is not very surprising that proving the existence of the limit for any sequence @xmath48 is much more complicated ( hence requires more assumptions on the energy @xmath0 ) than for a simple sequence made of the reference set @xmath47 .",
    "for this reason , we have divided our results in two parts and first treat the simpler case of @xmath47 .",
    "it is to be noticed that our method ( relying on the graf - schenker inequality ) is primarily devoted to the study of quantum systems interacting through coulomb forces",
    ". it might be applicable to other interactions but we shall not address this question here .",
    "we now describe vaguely the assumptions which we found to be sufficient on the function @xmath0 to prove the existence of the limit . of course we shall give more details later on .    to prove the existence of the limit for sequences made of the reference set @xmath47",
    ", we need five main assumptions . in principle , @xmath47 can be any convex bounded open set .",
    "the first is the normalization condition :    ( a1 ) : :    @xmath49 .",
    "the second important assumption on @xmath0 is the _ stability of matter _ :    ( a2 ) : :    @xmath50 .    as we explained before . in the following @xmath51",
    "is by definition the set of all bounded open subsets of @xmath1 , whereas @xmath52 will be a subclass of ` regular ' sets in a sense which will be made precise later .",
    "determining the correct regularity assumption is indeed a subtle task which we do not explain more in this introduction .",
    "we also need some _ translation invariance property _ : we assume that the following limit exists for all @xmath53 :    ( a3 ) : :    @xmath54    examples are given by fully - translation invariant systems , or periodic systems .",
    "but we can also treat perturbations of those .",
    "the following _ continuity _ property will play an important role :    ( a4 ) : :    @xmath55    it essentially says that a small decrease of @xmath30 will not decrease too much the energy .",
    "a similar property was used and proved in the crystal case by fefferman ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2 ) . in the above formula ( and below ) , ` error ' describes an error term which will be precised later .",
    "indeed , as we will see the specific form of the error terms will play an important role in the proof of the existence of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "finally , our method is mainly based on the following inequality    ( a5 ) : :    @xmath56    which compares the energy of @xmath30 with the energy of the reference set @xmath47 , averaged over rotations and translations of @xmath47 inside @xmath30 , see figure [ fig : a5 ] .",
    "this type of property was first remarked and used by conlon , lieb and yau @xcite , for quantum systems interacting with the yukawa potential and @xmath47 being a cube .",
    "for coulomb interactions , it was proved by graf and schenker @xcite in which case @xmath47 is chosen to be a tetrahedron .",

    "the numbers @xmath60 must satisfy some properties which we do not mention in this introduction , for this interpretation to be meaningful .     can be decomposed into energies in small sets @xmath70 of the tiling plus the interaction between them and the difference between entropies.,width=302 ]    the assumption which corresponds to * ( a5 ) * is that the total interaction energy is nonnegative when averaged over translations and rotations of the tiling ( the numbering of the equations corresponds to that of section [ section_general_domains ] ) :    ( a6.3 ) : :    @xmath71    finally , the function @xmath72 appearing in * ( a6 ) * is assumed to satisfy certain properties similar to the ones of entropies in statistical mechanics . in the applications",
