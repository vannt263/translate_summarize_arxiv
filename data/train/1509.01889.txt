    "while both permitted and forbidden optical emission lines are present in narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) , their broad balmer lines are narrower than those of normal broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies with fwhm(@xmath4 ) less than 2000 @xmath5 in nls1s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , nls1s also exhibit other extreme observational properties , such as relatively weak forbidden - line emission , i.e. , @xmath6 5007/h\\beta < 3 $ ] , strong permitted optical / uv fe ii emission lines , steep soft x - ray spectra , and rapid x - ray variability .",
    "nls1s are often thought to be young agns with relatively small black hole masses and high accretion rates ( review by * ? ? ?",
    "conventionally , nls1s were thought to be radio quiet . with the discovery of radio loud nls1s ( rlnls1s ) ,",
    "it has been realized , that nls1s simply have a low probability to be radio loud , but are not completely radio quiet @xcite .",
    "interestingly , rlnls1s are inhomogeneous in their radio properties .",
    "as shown in @xcite , most rlnls1s in their sample are compact , steep spectrum sources , and hence likely associated with compact steep - spectrum ( css ) radio sources .",
    "a few nls1s , however , showed flat or inverted radio spectra , and other properties characteristic of blazars .",
    "in fact , further observational evidence has recently accumulated , that a significant fraction of rlnls1s , especially at the highest radio - loudnesses , does display the characteristics of blazars , including large - amplitude radio flux and spectral variability , compact radio cores , very high variability brightness temperatures , enhanced optical continuum emission , flat x - ray spectra , and blazar - like spectral energy distributions ( sed ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and several of them have been detected in the @xmath7ray regime with @xmath8 for the first time @xcite .",
    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) is one of the most powerful tools for revealing the radio properties at parsec ( pc ) scales by direct imaging at milli - arcsecond resolution .",
    "the early japanese vlbi network observations of a few rlnls1s favored the presence of relativistic jets , based on their high brightness temperatures , and their inverted radio spectra @xcite . besides confirming the presence of relativistic jets , the previous work based on vlba data argued that rlnls1s can be either intrinsically radio loud , or apparently radio loud due to jet beaming effects @xcite",
    "however , due to the very limited numbers of rlnls1s observed with vlbi ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , it is far from clear that these features are universal in rlnls1s .    despite the rapidly growing number of rlnls1s @xcite , the mechanisms driving their radio properties are still unclear , including the role of accretion rate , black hole spin , circum - nuclear matter , host galaxy and merger history .",
    "in addition to radio observations , the detection of flaring @xmath9-ray emission has confirmed the presence of relativistic jets in a few rlnls1s @xcite .",
    "these observations may possibly be contrary to the well - known paradigm that jets are generally associated with elliptical host galaxies in typical radio - loud agns , while there is tentative evidence suggesting that at least a few low - redshift rlnls1s are hosted by spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "further , rlnls1s generally have small black hole masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , high accretion rates , and very strong fe ii emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are therefore at an opposite end of agn correlation space than classical radio - loud agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with their remarkable multi - wavelength properties and extreme location in agn parameter space , rlnls1s",
    "allow us to re - address some of the key questions regarding the physics of jet formation , for example , the physical conditions under which a jet can be launched .",
    "understanding the extreme properties ( e.g. , steep and flat spectra ) shown simultaneously in the same class of objects , would be of help in determining the physical conditions of the jets , and in the core regions of these galaxies .",
    "understanding the differences from other types of agns may then give further important insights into jet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , so far , little is known about the jets in rlnls1 , primarily due to the lack of systematic observations of their jets with high angular resolution .    in this paper , we present the first systematic high resolution radio study of rlnls1s from the vlba observations of 14 sources .",
    "the sample is presented in section 2 .",
    "the observations and data reduction is shown in section 3 , and the results are given in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is for the discussion , and the last section is dedicated to conclusions . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the spectral index @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 , in which @xmath15 is the flux density at frequency @xmath16 .",
    "to systematically study the radio structure at high resolution , we firstly compiled a large sample of rlnls1s with the radio loudness parameter @xmath17@xmath18 , by combining various samples available so far . the bulk of our sample is composed of the rlnls1s of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , totaling 99 objects .",
    "furthermore , 18 sources from the compilation of @xcite are added in .",
    "the final sample thus consists of 117 rlnls1s with @xmath19 , making it the largest rlnls1 sample so far . among the sample ,",
    "only eight sources were detected by @xmath8 lat @xcite .",
    "we searched in the literature and found that , at that time , only 10 sources had published vlbi observations , six with @xmath8 detection and four without .",
    "we excluded these ten sources from our vlba target list , along with two in the southern hemisphere ( rx j0134@xmath204258 and pks 0558@xmath20504 ) . as a result ,",
    "our final rlnls1 sample without published vlbi observations consists of 105 sources , all of which have 1.4 ghz flux densities measured from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ( first ) 1.4-ghz radio catalogue @xcite .",
    "this is the first of a series of papers to systematically study the jet properties of rlnls1s , aiming at gaining insights into the jet formation in these sources .",
    "as the first step of our systematic studies on the whole sample , we have performed vlba observations with a total observing time of 15 hours for 16 sources on october and november , 2013 ( program i d : bg217 ) , selected with 1.4 ghz flux densities @xmath2110 mjy from 105 objects without published vlbi observations at that time .",
    "the key scientific goal is to image the putative relativistic jets in these objects at high resolution .",
    "results have been obtained for 14 sources ( including one @xmath8 object ) with sufficient data quality to make images .",
    "the source list is shown in table [ source ] , in which the first 1.4 ghz , the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) 1.4 ghz @xcite , the 5 ghz flux density from the green bank 6-cm ( gb6 ) survey ( when available ) @xcite , and the conventional radio loudness @xmath22 are given .",
    "all these sources are from @xcite , except for sdss j142114.05 + 282452.8 from @xcite .",
    "observations were made with the vlba at the c band ranging from 3.9 to 7.9 ghz .",
    "we took the observational mode rdbe / ddc to use the largest recording rate of 2 gbps , corresponding to a recording bandwidth of 256 mhz in each of the two polarizations , to achieve sufficiently high imaging sensitivity .",
    "dual circular polarizations were recorded at two widely separated frequencies of about 5 ghz ( 4.868 ghz at 4.804 - 4.932 ghz ) and 6.7 ghz ( 6.668 ghz at 6.608 - 6.736 ghz ) so that the polarization and spectral information may be obtained simultaneously .",
    "sixteen target sources were observed in three separate blocks on oct .",
    "14 , and nov . 24 , 2013 .",
    "the observations were made in phase referencing mode for three objects with the lowest flux densities ( i.e. sdss j085001.17 + 462600.5 , sdss j113824.54 + 365327.1 and sdss j163401.94 + 480940.2 , see table [ source ] ) .",
    "the on - source observing time was about 50 minutes for these three sources , while it was about 30 minutes for the remaining sources .",
    "post data processing was performed within the package aips in a standard way for polarimetric vlbi observations , with the phase - referencing method applied to the three weakest sources . due to its extremely low linear polarized emission ,",
    "oq 208 was successfully used to obtain the instrumental polarization in all the observations . as for the absolute polarized positional angle calibration , the calibrator 3c",
    "286 was used but only a small part of the total flux density is restored , and hence only the fractional polarization images are given in this paper . it should be noted that the scaling factors in amplitude calibration for the left circular polarization of several antennas are obviously incorrect , therefore , we used the model of oq 208 obtained from the right - handed polarization to calibrate the amplitude of the left - handed polarization , which proves to be quite successful .",
    "imaging and model - fitting were done with difmap , and the final results are given in table [ modelfit ] .",
    "the typical uncertainties in the flux density and size are about 5% , which is estimated by using the approximation in @xcite .",
    "the vlba 5 ghz images for each object are shown in figs . [ j0814 ] - [ j1634 ] .",
    "we find that seven sources show a compact core only , while the remaining seven objects have core - jet structure .",
    "when available , we also present the images from archival vlba data for these sources .",
    "the radio core of each source is identified as a component with a flat spectrum of @xmath23 tentatively estimated with 5 and 6.7 ghz flux density from our measurements , and using archival vlba multi - band data for several objects as well ( see section [ ind.obj . ] ) .",
    "all sources are compact with all components being within @xmath24 mas ( @xmath25 24 - 38 pc depending on source redshift ) , except for two sources ( sdss j144318.56 + 472556.7 and sdss j154817.92 + 351128.0 ) with extended jet emission at a distance of @xmath26 mas ( see section [ ind.obj . ] ) .",
    "our results thus indicate that the majority of our sources is compact at vlbi mas scales .    from the high - resolution vlba images ,",
    "the brightness temperature of the radio core @xmath27 in the rest frame can be estimated with @xcite    @xmath28    in which @xmath29 is source redshift , @xmath30 is the core flux density at frequency @xmath16 , and @xmath31 is the source angular diameter @xmath32 where a and b are the major and minor axis , respectively .",
    "this estimate actually represents a lower limit on the brightness temperature .",
    "the doppler factor of the jet @xmath33 can be usually constrained by    @xmath34    in which @xmath35 is the intrinsic brightness temperature .",
    "normally , @xmath35 can be taken as the equipartition brightness temperature of @xmath36 k @xcite , or the inverse compton catastrophe brightness temperature of @xmath37 k @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that the doppler factor estimated from radio observations is generally smaller than that from the sed modelling , specifically for @xmath7ray sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". this could be due to the fact that @xmath7rays are produced in very compact regions .",
    "in contrast , the radio emission is likely from much larger regions , in which the jet blob is expanded to be optically thin , therefore , it likely has decelerated ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the core brightness temperature ranges from @xmath0 to @xmath1 k with a median value of @xmath2 k ( see table [ modelfit ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the radio emission is from non - thermal jets , confirming that powerful jets can be formed in accretion systems with relatively small black hole masses and high accretion rates ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the vlba core brightness temperatures of blazars typically range between @xmath38 and @xmath39 k with a median value near @xmath40 k , and can even extend up to @xmath41 k @xcite . while these measurements represent lower limits , the brightness temperatures of most our sources are below the equipartition and inverse compton catastrophic limits .",
    "therefore , the beaming effect is generally not significant in our sources . in principle",
    ", the strong doppler beaming requires not only a nearly pole - on view but also a relativistic bulk jet speed .",
    "thus , the lack of a strong beaming effect implies that the bulk jet speed may likely be low in our sources , which still needs to be confirmed with higher - resolution observations , since measured brightness temperatures are lower limits .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that our sources are seen at slightly larger viewing angles .",
    "we find that the rlnls1s with core only morphology generally have lower core and total flux density , lower redshift and lower brightness temperature than those of core - jet objects ( see fig . [ ccj ] ) .",
    "this implies that the former likely have less powerful jets and are less beamed compared to the latter .",
    "the fractional polarization images are given in fig .",
    "[ fp ] for five objects .",
    "we find that the fractional polarization in the jets ( @xmath42 % ) is evidently higher than that of the radio cores ( @xmath43 % ) ( see fig .",
    "this may plausibly be caused by the strong faraday rotation in the nuclear region due to the high plasma density , and/or depolarization due to the complex core structure .",
    "the polarization is clearly asymmetric and there are fractional polarization variations in some regions of the jet .",
    "this is likely caused by the relatively strong jet - ism interaction at the locations of high fractional polarization due to the jet bulk motion to that side , in the cases of sdss j081432.11 + 560956.6 , sdss j090227.16 + 044309.6 , sdss j130522.75 + 511640.3 , and sdss j154817.92 + 351128.0 . in sdss j144318.56 + 472556.7 , the polarization shows a prominent gradient along the jet direction , which well matches the jet knots . in this case , the surface shock may play an important role in the emission of these regions .      besides the vlbi radio structure , the radio spectrum is also important to study the source nature .",
    "the individual objects were investigated in detail by collecting the multi - frequency and multi - epoch radio data from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , in combination with the analysis on our vlba images and archival vlba data ( if available ) .",
    "all sources were conventionally classified into flat - spectrum ( @xmath23 , in seven sources ) and steep - spectrum ( @xmath44 , in seven sources ) rlnls1s ( see table [ source ] ) , by using the estimated radio spectral index @xmath13 from low - resolution ned data ( i.e. non - vlbi data ) , unless otherwise stated ( see e.g. , sections [ 0953 ] and [ 1037 ] ) .",
    "the source has a flat radio spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath45 based on 325 mhz , 1.4 , and 4.85 ghz data collected from ned .",

    "the multi - wavelength data shows an overall flat spectrum ( @xmath96 ) from 74 mhz all the way to 8.4 ghz , and the spectrum is flat ( @xmath97 ) above 1.4 ghz ( see fig .",
    "the overall radio spectrum shows that this source is most likely a flat - spectrum source , resembling blazars .",
    "however , there perhaps is a turnover below 100 mhz , possibly due to synchrotron self - absorption . the total vlba flux density ( 33 mjy )",
    "is about 55% of that of vla ( 60 mjy , from ned ) , indicating that about half of the jet emission is resolved out at vlba resolution .",
    "however , alternatively , the flux difference between vlba and vla can also be due to the flux variations since it is a flat - spectrum object .",
    "the brightness temperature of the core is @xmath98 k at 5 ghz .",
    "a variability brightness temperature of @xmath39 k was found at 4.85 ghz by @xcite , which implies a doppler factor of @xmath99 .",
    "only a compact component is detected in our vlba image ( see fig . [ j1634 ] ) , with brightness temperature of @xmath2 k. the spectrum between wenss 325 mhz and nvss 1.4 ghz data of similar resolution is flat with @xmath100 .",
    "the first flux density is only about 55% of nvss , implying that the remaining flux is either resolved out at first resolution , or else the source is variable .",
    "all our sources were selected with 1.4 ghz flux densities @xmath2110 mjy , and they are very radio loud with @xmath101 ( see table [ source ] ) . therefore , they represent the most extreme rlnls1s in terms of their radio loudness @xmath22",
    ". however , their jet properties are not homogeneous , in terms of the mas scale morphology and the overall radio spectral shape .",
    "a variety of mas scale morphologies has been found , including compact core only ( 7 out of 14 ) , compact core - jet ( 5 of 14 ) , and extended core - jet structures ( 2 of 14 ) . based on the compactness defined as the core to total flux ratio ,",
    "most sources ( 12 of 14 ) are compact , and core - dominated with compactness larger than 0.5 .",
    "two sources , sdssj144318.56 + 472556.7 and sdssj154817.92 + 351128.0 , have a compactness of @xmath102 with a large - scale jet extending to about 30 and 60 mas ( see figs . [ j1443 ] and [ j1548 ] ) , respectively .",
    "a one - sided core - jet structure is detected in all the resolved objects ( 7 out of 14 ) , which is commonly found in blazars .",
    "as for the radio spectral shape , we found flat spectra in seven sources , and steep spectra in the other seven sources , albeit large uncertainties in sdss j095317.09 + 283601.5 and sdss j103727.45 + 003635.6 ( see section [ ind.obj . ] and table [ source ] ) .",
    "in our sample , there is no strong relationship between the compactness and spectral index .",
    "the steep spectrum sources do not prefer to have more extended structures , while those with flat spectra do not appear more compact .",
    "it should be noted that our measurements of brightness temperature are typically lower limits , and the true brightness temperatures can therefore be higher .",
    "however , taken at face value , the median brightness temperature of our sample is significantly lower than that of typical blazars ( of order @xmath40 k ; * ? ? ?",
    "if confirmed by future higher - resolution observations , this finding can , in principle , be explained in two ways .",
    "either , our sources are not significantly beamed , then likely implying a low bulk speed of the jet .",
    "this is likely the case for flat - spectrum sources , since the viewing angles are expected to be small in these sources .",
    "alternatively , these sources are seen at relatively large angle , and doppler - deboosting plays a role , which could be the situation in steep - spectrum objects ( e.g. , sdss j104732.68 + 472532.1 , see section [ 1047 ] ) . indeed , although not conclusive due to the lower limit , the brightness temperatures of steep spectrum sources are systematically lower than those of flat spectrum sources with median values of @xmath54 and @xmath2 k for steep and flat sources ( see fig .",
    "[ ccj ] ) , respectively .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the expectation that flat spectrum sources are usually viewed at relatively smaller angles , and then have a relatively larger beaming effect than steep spectrum sources .",
    "moreover , the steep - spectrum rlnls1s were recently proposed as the parent population of flat - spectrum rlnls1s @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the fundamental jet physics could be similar , such as the jet bulk speed , and the observational differences in two populations could be mainly due to the different viewing angle . therefore , given the overall properties of our sources , the first possibility is favored that the jet bulk speed is likely low in our sources .",
    "consistently , the radio monitoring of @xmath9-ray - detected nls1s shown that the computed variability brightness temperatures are in general moderate , in contrast to the majority of blazars , implying mildly relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "the mildly relativistic jets were also found in @xcite for three rlnls1s based on various information , such as the moderate core brightness temperature , the jet / counter - jet intensity ratio and the extension length ratios from vlba and vla observations .",
    "flux variability of each source was searched for by comparing the first and nvss fluxes . due to the different beam sizes of nvss and first , we conservatively treat the sources with the first peak flux larger than the integrated flux of nvss as possible variable sources .",
    "the significance of the variation @xmath103 is calculated as the ratio of the flux difference between the first peak flux and nvss integrated flux to the combined uncertainties including the corresponding uncertainties in first and nvss fluxes and the additional systematic uncertainties ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "using a threshold @xmath104 , we found flux variations in only one source , sdssj085001.17 + 462600.5 ( @xmath103=4.0 ) . for most sources ( 10/14 ) ,",
    "the first peak and integrated fluxes are in agreement with the integrated nvss flux within 10% .",
    "the mean values of the flux ratio of first to nvss are @xmath105 and @xmath106 , for first peak and integrated fluxes , respectively .",
    "this again shows that variations are usually not significant for most sources .",
    "moreover , it indicates that all our sources are mostly compact , without much extended diffuse emission , as often found in rlnls1s @xcite .",
    "indeed , all fourteen nls1 galaxies of our sample were detected as single unresolved sources within 1 arcmin of the sdss position in both first and nvss , indicating compact radio structure at first resolution ( 5 arcsec ) , except if any extended emission was faint , and beyond the detection threshold of nvss and first .",
    "we tentatively use the deconvolved major axis provided in the first catalog as an upper limit of the linear size of each source .",
    "the linear sizes range from 2.1 to 17.4 kpc ( see table [ source ] ) , confirming that they are compact .",
    "the association of rlnls1s with css sources has already been proposed by many authors @xcite , and recently by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the hypothesis of css sources as the parent population of rlnls1s was also discussed , in which the rlnls1s with a flat radio spectrum could be css sources with jets pointing towards the observer @xcite .",
    "indeed , the steep - spectrum rlnls1s were recently found to likely be the best candidates for the parent population of flat - spectrum rlnls1s , although not conclusive and disk - hosted radio galaxies have yet to be included @xcite . in our sample ,",
    "seven sources have compact structure and steep spectrum ( although uncertain in the case of sdss j095317.09 + 283601.5 , see section [ ind.obj . ] ) .",
    "these share some resemblance with css sources",
    ". however , their vlbi structure is different from that of typical css sources @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the majority of css sources have a two - sided structure and the radio emission is dominated by lobes , jets and hotspots . in our sample , four out of seven steep spectrum sources have core - only morphology , and a one sided core - jet structure is found in the remaining three objects . for core - jet sources , the core flux dominates in two objects ( @xmath107% in sdssj095317.09 + 283601.5 , @xmath108% in sdssj130522.75 + 511640.3 ) . only in sdssj144318.56 + 472556.7 ,",
    "the radio emission is dominated by the elongated jet structure and diffuse emission with about 40% of the total emission in the core . while most of the high - power typical css sources have a double or triple morphology at vlbi scales @xcite , compact core only and core - jet structures",
    "have been detected in css sources with relatively low radio power @xcite . in terms of the linear size ( using first major axis as upper limit ) and 5 ghz radio power @xcite",
    ", our nls1 galaxies resemble the low - power css sources of @xcite . in the radio power versus linear size diagram , the low - power css objects occupy the space below the main evolutionary path of radio objects .",
    "the authors argued that many of these might be short - lived objects , and their radio emission may be disrupted several times before they become fr iis .",
    "alternatively , some of the short - lived low - power css objects could be precursors to large - scale fr is ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the argument linking rlnls1s with css sources mainly relies on the compact arcsec scale structure in rlnls1s . the majority of rlnls1s exhibit compact radio emission , while extended emission has only been detected in nine rlnls1s @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the jet of rlnls1s has low kinetic power because of the small mass and because it has to propagate in a gas - rich environment , which can be likely responsible for rare detection of extended emission .",
    "however , recent vla observations of three arbitrarily selected rlnls1s , show that all sources possess kpc - scale extended emission @xcite .",
    "one of the css - like sources in our sample , sdss j095317.09 + 283601.5 , was reported to have a two - sided , mildly core - dominated jet structure with diffuse lobes at an overall projected linear size of about 70.2 kpc in their study , largely exceeding the typical size of css sources .",
    "the authors argued that the extended emission could be more common when observed with enhanced sensitivity , such as the upgraded vla . while this indicates the capability of jet extension to kpc scale , more observations are needed to study the fraction of extended emission in the overall rlnls1 population .",
    "with nvss , polarized flux was detected in 11 out of the 14 nls1 galaxies of our sample .",
    "the fractional polarization ranges from 0.5% to 5.2% with a mean value of 2.2% .",
    "there is no significant systematic difference of fractional polarization between steep and flat spectrum sources . in the steep spectrum sources ,",
    "the fractional polarization is similar to that of css sources ( @xmath109 at 6 cm , see * ? ? ?",
    "several studies of the polarization properties of css sources have shown that sources smaller than a few kpc have very low values of polarized emission at frequencies below 8.4 ghz ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this result has been interpreted by assuming that compact sources are highly depolarized by the dense interstellar medium that enshrouds the radio emission and acts as a faraday screen .",
    "when using the deconvolved major axis as the upper limit of the source linear size , we found that the fractional polarization of steep spectrum sources is below 2% for objects",
    "smaller than 10 kpc , while higher than 4% for larger sources .",
    "this suggests that there may be an abrupt change in the properties of the ism at a radius of approximately 10 kpc , possibly related to the outer boundary of the narrow line region ( nlr ) , which however needs further studies .",
    "the radio power distribution of our rlnls1 galaxies overlaps with the lower part of that of csss @xcite . as such ,",
    "if there is an overlap between csss and rlnls1 galaxies , it should consist mostly of csss having low radio power and relatively small black hole masses .",
    "besides seven steep spectrum sources in our sample , seven galaxies show flat radio spectra , implying relationships with blazars .",
    "recently , @xcite conducted a multi - wavelength survey of 42 rlnls1s with flat radio spectra .",
    "they found that the jet power is generally lower than fsrqs and bl lac objects , but partially overlapping with the latter , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "in fact , once normalised by the mass of the central black holes , the jet powers are consistent with each other for these three types of agns , indicating the scalability of the jet .",
    "the authors argued that the central engine of rlnls1s is apparently quite similar to that of blazars , despite the observational differences .",
    "based on the detailed analysis of the @xmath9-ray flux variability and spectral properties of five rlnls1s , @xcite found that these @xmath9-nls1s are similar to fsrqs in terms of their average @xmath9-ray photon index , however their @xmath9-ray luminosities are lower than powerful fsrqs but higher than bl lac objects .",
    "in view of the curvature in the @xmath9-ray spectrum and flux variability amplitudes , the authors suggested that these @xmath9-ray nls1s could be similar to powerful fsrqs , but with low or moderate jet power .",
    "although similarities have been found between rlnls1s and blazars , we can not yet perform a comparison between the host galaxies of blazars ( commonly found in ellipticals ) and the rlnls1s of our sample .",
    "all our sources are at relatively high redshift , and their sdss images are insufficient for host analysis .    it has been suggested that outflows in agns can be accelerated by the radiation pressure of the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could be important for the jet production in sources accreting at rates near the eddington limit , as commonly found in nls1 galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite found that it is difficult for the outflows to be directly driven from the photospheres of the radiation - dominated disks , which implies that hot gas ( probably in the corona ) is necessary for launching an outflow from the radiation - pressure - dominated disk .",
    "the authors investigated outflows accelerated from the hot corona above the disk by the magnetic field and radiation force of the accretion disk , and found that with the help of the radiation force , the mass - loss rate in the outflow is high , which however leads to a slow outflow . in our rlnls1s sources ,",
    "the accretion rate is high , and the radiation pressure could be significant . therefore , the scenario of @xcite might be relevant in explaining why the jets in rlnls1s are in general mildly relativistic compared with those in blazars .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that the jet in rlnls1s can be possibly launched by a rapidly accreting disk along with the winds when the angle between the poloidal component of the magnetic field and the accretion disk is less than a critical angle .",
    "alternatively , in the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism , the jet energy and angular momentum can be extracted from a rotating black hole @xcite .",
    "the low jet speed in rlnls1s is consistent with the significant correlation between black hole mass and the jet bulk lorentz factor found in typical blazars by @xcite , as the black hole masses of rlnls1s are systematically lower than blazars .",
    "this correlation can be well explained in a black hole spin scenario , in the sense that the faster moving jets are magnetically accelerated by the magnetic fields threading the horizon of more rapidly rotating black holes @xcite .",
    "recent investigation indeed suggested that most supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. for fsrqs ) have on average higher spins than the black holes in spiral galaxies , where random , small accretion episodes ( e.g. , tidally disrupted stars , accretion of molecular clouds ) might have played a more important role @xcite . if rlnls1s do follow the correlation of @xcite , the low jet speed in rlnls1s may then be due to the low spin .",
    "few actual bh spin estimates for nls1 galaxies are available to date , and none for the radio - loudest nls1 galaxies . based on deep x - ray observations of a few nearby ( radio - quiet ) nls1 galaxies , intermediate to very high spins were estimated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , while @xcite preferred a low - spin solution , based on sed fitting of the nls1 galaxy pg 1244 + 026 .",
    "@xcite reported indications for low or intermediate average bh spin , estimated from stacked x - ray spectra of a larger sample of 51 nls1 galaxies .",
    "estimates for radio - loud nls1 galaxies are not yet available .    up to now , less than ten rlnls1s were detected in @xmath9-rays with @xmath8/lat ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the only source in our sample with a tentative @xmath9-ray detection with @xmath8 , sdss j124634.65 + 023809.0 , has the steepest spectrum with a @xmath9-ray photon index of @xmath110 , however with the lowest test statistic ( ts=15 ) @xcite .",
    "this source shows compact core - only morphology ( see fig .",
    "[ j1246 ] ) , different from the common core - jet structure in other @xmath9-ray sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the brightness temperature of @xmath72 k is significantly lower compared to other @xmath9-ray sources , which is usually larger than @xmath38 k ( e.g. , pmn j0948 + 0022 in * ? ? ?",
    "this is somewhat in contrast to the notion that the @xmath9-ray objects tend to have larger beaming effects than non-@xmath9-ray detected ones , for example , as suggested for bl lac objects in @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the majority of the @xmath9-ray detected nls1 galaxies have published vlbi observations , and were therefore not re - analyzed in the study presented here .",
    "therefore , our sample likely excludes a few of the most variable , and most highly beamed sources .",
    "we will present the results for a sample of fainter sources in a forthcoming paper based on the vlba observations ( gu et al .",

    "moreover , in order to directly constrain the jet bulk speed , multi - epoch vlba observations have been planned to detect the jet proper motion for a sample of rlnls1s with resolved core - jet structure .",
    "all these observations will provide us with a deeper understanding on the jet formation in these low black hole mass , and high accretion rate systems .",
    "as the first step of our systematic studies of the pc scale radio structure of rlnls1s , we have obtained vlba observations of 14 very radio - loud nls1 galaxies in 2013 .",
    "these observations reveal that the radio morphology of the sources is generally compact .",
    "although all these nls1 galaxies are very radio - loud objects with @xmath101 , their jet properties are diverse , in terms of the mas scale morphology and overall radio spectral shape . the low core brightness temperatures ,",
    "if confirmed with higher resolution , indicate that beaming effects are generally not significant , likely implying a low jet speed in these sources .",
    "this , in combination with the low kinetic / radio power , is likely responsible for the compact vlba radio structure in most sources . the mildly relativistic jet in these high accretion rate systems",
    "could likely be explained by the scenario that jets / outflows are accelerated from the hot corona above the disk by the magnetic field and radiation force of the accretion disk , in which the jets / outflows are slow .",
    "alternatively , the low jet bulk velocity can be explained by the blandford - znajek mechanism , if the black holes have low spin .",

    "<S> we present the detection of compact radio structures of fourteen radio - loud narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies from very long baseline array observations at 5 ghz , which were performed in 2013 . while 50% of the sources of our sample show a compact core only , the remaining 50% exhibit a core - jet structure . </S>",
    "<S> the measured brightness temperatures of the cores range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 k with a median value of @xmath2 k , indicating that the radio emission is from non - thermal jets , and that , likely , most sources are not strongly beamed , then implying a low jet speed in these radio - loud nls1 galaxies . in combination with archival data taken at multiple frequencies , we find that seven sources show flat or even inverted radio spectra , while steep spectra are revealed in the remaining seven objects . </S>",
    "<S> although all these sources are very radio - loud with @xmath3 , their jet properties are diverse , in terms of their milli - arcsecond ( mas ) scale ( pc scale ) morphology and their overall radio spectral shape . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence for slow jet speeds ( i.e. , less relativistic jets ) , in combination with the low kinetic / radio power , may offer an explanation for the compact vlba radio structure in most sources . </S>",
    "<S> the mildly relativistic jets in these high accretion rate systems are consistent with a scenario , where jets are accelerated from the hot corona above the disk by the magnetic field and the radiation force of the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , a low jet bulk velocity can be explained by low spin in the blandford - znajek mechanism . </S>"
