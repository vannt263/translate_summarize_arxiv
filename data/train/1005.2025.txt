    "an emerging flux region ( efr ) is the early stage of an active region where magnetic flux loops emerge from underneath the solar photosphere @xcite . with h@xmath0 line center ,",
    "typical efrs show a pair of bright regions and dark loops between them . the dark loop and the cluster of them",
    "are called as the arch filament and the arch filament system ( afs ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the typical size of arch filaments is about 30,000 km @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of an arch filament is 10 - 30 minutes and the rise velocity is from @xmath1 to @xmath2 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the both ends of an arch filament are called as footpoints .",
    "the footpoints appears as plage regions in h@xmath0 line center image . at the footpoints of an arch filament",
    "there are strong downflows with 35 - 50 km s@xmath3 .",
    "although ca h and k lines have been used for solar observation , there are few studies about the ca h and k spectroscopic observation of efrs .",
    "@xcite observed an afs with the ca k line filtergram and reported that the arch filaments were less pronounced in the ca k than in h@xmath0 . since ca h and k lines show double reversed spectral profiles , it is difficult to determine the doppler shift of their components .",
    "@xcite performed a spectroscopic observation on an efr and measured the doppler shift of ca h3 absorption core , which showed about 7 km s@xmath3 rising motion at the apex of arch filaments and at least 40 km s@xmath3 downflows at the footpoints .",
    "they also measured the dopplershift of the fe lines at 6302.5  and 5691.5  ( both are photospheric lines ) to be 1.5 km s@xmath3 downflows at the footpoints .",
    "the spectro - heliogram of a fairly large efr with high spatial resolution were presented by @xcite .",
    "he picked up the spectra of the footpoints of arch filaments and found that there were additional absorptions on the k@xmath4 red peak ( k@xmath5 ) .",
    "the doppler shift of the additional absorption was of the order 40 - 50 km s@xmath3 .",
    "he interpreted them as due to the formation of the shocks at the footpoints .",
    "there is a threshold flux for an afs .",
    "@xcite estimated a minimum total flux of @xmath6 mx to form an afs .",
    "@xcite found the threshold flux to be @xmath7-@xmath8 mx for an afs formation .",
    "as the observation technologies advanced , smaller scale emergences of magnetic flux have been observed .",
    "especially the solar optical telescope ( sot : @xcite ) on - board hinode satellite has revealed the microscopic dynamics and faint structures of small magnetic phenomena . @xcite observed a granular size ( @xmath9 ) efr in the quiet - sun internetwork using the spectro - polarimeter of sot .",
    "@xcite investigated the temporal evolution of a small - scale efr with the ca h filtergram , the fe stokes i and v filtergram .",
    "he found the flux tube expanding laterally in the photosphere and the lower chromosphere with a speed of 3.8 km s@xmath3",
    ". a farther study on small - scale efr was performed by @xcite , who showed the relation between the ca h intensity and the magnetic flux of the footpoints .",
    "he measured the total flux of the efr to be the order of @xmath10 mx .    on the other hand , many numerical simulation of efrs have been performed @xcite .",
    "@xcite simulated the three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) of the emerging magnetic flux . in his study ,",
    "magnetic loops with less than @xmath11 mx can not expand into the corona .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite also performed the mhd simulations of efrs with less magnetic flux , which showed lateral expansions and less uprising motions .    in this paper",
    "we report the spectroscopic investigation of the small - scale efr obtained by hida - hinode cooperative observation ( hop12 ) .",
    "firstly , from a morphological standpoint , we compare the images of the efr observed in hida and by hinode .",
    "next we perform a double gaussian fitting on the ca k line spectra to obtain the doppler shift of k@xmath12 components .",
    "the temporal evolutions of the obtained physical parameters of the efr are compared each other , then we figure out the dynamics of the emergence event . at the end of this paper",
    "we discuss about the results of our observational study comparing with previous mhd simulations .",
    "the observation was performed on aug 8 , 2007 , in the campaign program ( hop12 ) .",
    "the target was the active region noaa 10966 .",
    "noaa 10966 consisted of a simple monopole sunspot when it appeared over the east limb on aug 4 .",
    "hinode observed the active region with broadband filter imager ( bfi ) and narrowband filter imager ( nfi ) of solar optical telescope ( sot ) .",
    "ca h ( 3968.5  ) filtergrams were taken by bfi with the bandpass of 3  .",
    "the pixel size was and the temporal resolution was 40 seconds .",
    "the fe ( 6302  ) stokes iquv shutterless filtergrams were obtained by nfi with the bandpass of 90 m .",
    "the pixel size was with the temporal resolution of 40 seconds .",
    "figure [ fig:01 ] shows the examples of the data taken by hinode instruments at 03:09 ut on aug 8 .",
    "the boxes in each panels indicate the position of the flux emergence of our analysis .",
    "( 80mm,160mm)01.eps    for sot data we performed the dark and flat calibrations in a standard manner .",
    "we removed the chromospheric oscillation patterns of ca h images by applying the subsonic filter @xcite on the successive images using lp_subsonic.pro of ssw .",
    "the function of subsonic filtering is to suppress the sonic fluctuation component in fourier space and to reveal the slowly varying pattern from the time series of two - dimensional images . in the shutterless mode ,",
    "nfi processed the data into multiple thin stripes .",
    "these stripes were rejoined into the 2d images of stokes iquv .",
    "we obtained spatially scanned ca k spectra of the active region with the vertical spectrograph ( vs ) described in @xcite .",
    "the spectral sampling was 0.020  and the angular sampling along the slit was pixel@xmath3 .",
    "the full wave - range of the obtained spectrum was 16  .",
    "the spatial scan were performed by reciprocating the telescope pointing on the active region .",
    "for one reciprocal scan it took 40 seconds .",
    "so the region was spatially scanned at every 20 seconds .",
    "the spatial scan step was about and time interval between two spatial steps was 0.05 seconds .",
    "after the dark and flat - field corrections , the obtained data were combined with the transmission profile of ca h filter of hinode / sot to make the reconstructed quasi - hinode ca images .",
    "the spectro - heliograms were made from the spatially scanned spectral data at the wavelength of @xmath13  ( k@xmath14/center ) , @xmath15  ( k@xmath16 ) and @xmath17  ( wing ) for the morphological analysis .",
    "we compared the quasi - hinode ca image to the real ca h image of sot and obtained the pointing information for the spectro - heliogram data ( figure [ fig:02 ] ) .",
    "we studied the morphological and spectral characteristics of the small - scale efr .",
    "we identified the efr from the images obtained by hinode / sot ca h and fe .",
    "then we searched the counterparts of the efrs in the ca k spectro - heliogram images obtained by dst / vs . to confirm the relation between the lateral expansion and the upward motion of the emerging flux , we measured the width of the arch filament with the method introduced by @xcite .",
    "also the intensity of fe stokes i and the linear polarization degree @xmath18 were derived by averaging over @xmath19 at the emerging site .",
    "for the spectroscopic analysis , the ca k line profiles at the apex of the arch filament were examined ( figure [ fig:03 ] ) .",
    "first , we calculated the background profile by averaging the spectra in the quiet region .",
    "then we selected the profiles at the top of arch filament within the range of @xmath19 considering the seeing of the atmosphere ( shown by white squares in figure [ fig:04 ] ) .",
    "we subtracted the background profile from the arch top profiles to obtain the enhancement profiles ( i.e. the difference profiles ) .",
    "the difference profiles were fitted by a gaussian function ( g1 ) with reference to the k@xmath4 flanks intensity ( outsides of @xmath20 0.16  from the k@xmath4 center ) .",
    "the wavelength distance between the line center and the g1 axis was taken as the doppler shift of the k@xmath4 component .",
    "after the g1 was subtracted from the difference profile , another gaussian function ( g2 ) was fitted to the residual profile . from the shift of g2 , we estimated the doppler shift of the k@xmath14 components .",
    "the derivation was performed to each pixels within the selected area , and then the maximum blue shift was adopted as the doppler velocity of the arch filament .",
    "the negative offset of g1 base intensity is due to the darkening in continuum intensity at the central part of the efr .",
    "the continuum darkening can be seen in the stokes i image of figure [ fig:01 ] .",
    "the efr appeared at the west of noaa 10966 in ca h image of sot from 02:59 ut on 8 aug , 2007 .",

    "the speed of ca filament elongation was about 4 km s@xmath3 , which is nearly the same as the separation speed of efr footpoints ( 5 km s@xmath3 ) observed by @xcite .",
    "the result is consistent with the view that the linear size of an efr expands along the time at the initial phase of emergence .",
    "the stokes i image shows the trace of the ca filament as the dark granular lane .",
    "the horizontal magnetic field appears at 02:56 ut in the @xmath21 image , indicating that the emergence began at the time .",

    "the observed maximum velocity for the preceding filament was @xmath22 km s@xmath3 at 03:00 ut .",
    "the horizontal field increased at 02:56 ut and lasted until 03:18 ut associated with the main ca filament .",
    "just simultaneously , the dark granular lane in the stokes i image started to appear .",
    "4 .   the main ca filament appeared in sot filtergram at 02:59 ut , 3 minutes after the horizontal field emergence .",
    "the filament grew with the elongation speed of @xmath9 4 km s@xmath3 and the expansion speed of 2.9 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the main filament reached its maximum width of at 03:08 ut .",
    "the k@xmath4 doppler velocity was about @xmath30 km s@xmath3 for this 4 minutes period .",
    "ca k@xmath14 image did not show a prominent darkening .",
    "then the doppler shift in ca k@xmath4 corresponding to the main filament exhibited the acceleration of @xmath27 km s@xmath26 from 03:10 ut .",
    "the maximum velocity of @xmath24 km s@xmath3 were observed at 03:15 ut for the main filament .",
    "we consider that the time - lag of 10 minutes between the appearance of the horizontal field ( 02:56 ut ) and the k@xmath16 darkening ( 03:06 ut ) is due to the formation height difference . assuming that the k@xmath4 formation height to be about 700 km @xcite , the average rise velocity is calculated as about @xmath31 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the estimated rise velocity is similar to the observed k@xmath4 doppler velocities , which varied between @xmath32 km s@xmath3 and @xmath33 km s@xmath3 .",
    "these observed values are consistent with the result of numerical simulations very well .",
    "the temporal difference between the k@xmath16 darkening and the beginning of the acceleration is interpreted as below : when arch filament rises above the photosphere , the flux tube expands both laterally and vertically . however , if the total flux is not enough , the flux tube can not rise but expands laterally @xcite .",
    "then the laterally expanded flux tube gradually rises @xcite and will wait for the buoyancy instability to develop .",
    "the velocity of the gradually rising phase is in the range of @xmath34 km s@xmath3 to @xmath35 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this value is consistent with the constant velocity of about @xmath32 km s@xmath3 , which was observed in this study .",
    "we estimated the total flux of the arch filament using soho / mdi data . the magnetic field strength is less than 100 g at the footpoint of the arch filament .",
    "the size of footpoint is about , so the upper limit of the total flux is about @xmath36 mx .",
    "this value is smaller than the threshold mentioned by @xcite .",
    "so this emerging flux is thought to be unable to reach the corona .",
    "the mean upward velocity ( @xmath32 km s@xmath3 ) of the arch filament measured in this study is fairly smaller than the doppler velocity of k@xmath14 component obtained by @xcite . with this velocity , during the rising phase of 20 minutes the gas can not reach the formation height of k@xmath14 ( @xmath37 km ) .",
    "actually , our k@xmath14 spectro - heliogram image did not show any prominent darkening .",
    "so we suggest that the flux tube with less magnetic field strength can gain too small buoyancy to rise to the upper chromosphere and the corona , as was indicated by the simulation of @xcite .",
    "finally we give a comment on the time difference of 3 minutes between the darkenings observed in stokes i and in ca h of hinode .",
    "this value is much smaller than the time - lag between the appearances of the stokes i darkening and the k@xmath16 darkening ( 10 minutes ) .",
    "since the photospheric dark features may be detected in hinode ca h images due to the broadness of the filter pass band , the rising loops can be seen in ca h bfi images earlier than the arrival to chromospheric heights . in our study",
    ", we could detect the real rising motion of loops with the help of spectroscopic analysis .    in conclusion",
    ", we have first observationally detected the detailed evolution of the magnetic flux emergence of less magnetic flux than the active efrs and confirmed that the observed evolution is consistent with those simulated and predicted by the previous theoretical works .",
