    "the question on whether dna is a conductor or an insulator is still controversial due to the different results obtained in the measurements of dna conductivity @xcite .",
    "the related issue of long - range charge transfer in dna which is associated with the problem of charge mobility has also been discussed for many years with an equal amount of heated debate .",
    "it has been suggested that the overlap of the electronic @xmath1 orbitals along the stacked base pairs provides a pathway for charge propagation over 50   and the reaction rate between electron donors and acceptors does not decay exponentially with the distance .",
    "a multiple - step hopping mechanism was recently proposed to explain the charge transfer behavior in dna @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the single g - c base pair is considered as a hole donor due to its low ionization potential if compared to the one on a - t base pairs .",
    "long - range charge transfer is accomplished by a series of incoherent charge tunneling events between two nearest g - c base pairs separated by a - t pairs .",
    "the probability of the short - range tunneling ( super - exchange ) strongly depends on the distance between the two g - c base pairs .",
    "however , recent experimental results for the reaction rate only showed a very slight distance dependence for the charge hole transfer through more than three a - t base pairs @xcite .",
    "it is now believed that a hole can be created in a a - t base pair by thermal activation from a g - c base pair when charge tunneling becomes unlikely over a long distance @xcite .",
    "the long - range hopping can , therefore , be carried out through a long a - t bridge just as by a series of short - range tunnelings in the g - c pairs .",
    "although this mechanism seems to give a good interpretation of the charge transfer in dna , the cause of the incoherent charge hopping over localized states of the hole carriers with such low reaction rate ( @xmath2 ) has not yet been well understood .    besides the multiple - step hopping mechanism , polaron motion has also been considered as a possible mechanism to explain the phenomena of dna charge transfer @xcite .",
    "the charge coupling with the dna structural deformations can create a polaron and cause a localized state . from the study of the dynamical properties in one dimensional systems",
    ", it is known that the polaron behaves as a brownian particle that collides with the low energy excitations of its environment which acts as a heat bath @xcite .",
    "this diffusive behavior is very similar to the multiple - step hopping mechanism based on a random walk model , although the former occurs in a continuous media while the latter is considered on the discrete sites of a lattice .",
    "thus , the behavior of the incoherent charge hopping can be understood as polaron diffusion .    for most physical systems acoustical and optical phonons",
    "are the main lattice excitations .",
    "however , when a system contains hydrogen bonds , proton motions also need to be considered . instead of oscillatory motions in a single - minimum potential",
    ", protons can tunnel from one side of a hydrogen bond to another in a double - minimum potential @xcite .",
    "this proton tunneling causes interstrand charge hopping and is important in spontaneous mutations . since",
    "genetic information can be preserved only when a nucleotide base is matched with its complementary one by hydrogen bonding , the positions of protons are the main identification for dna polymerases to make replications with high fidelity",
    ". however , the reaction of proton transfer could generate tautomeric base pairs and destroy the fidelity @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the proton tunneling in the isolated base pairs and its possible biological implications were widely discussed by lwdin many years ago @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that proton transfer and charge conduction in stacked base pairs are affected by each other @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental results on the influence of mismatched base pairs show that the proton transfer is required for the long - range charge transfer @xcite .",
    "thus the effect of proton tunneling will be discussed here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the model for charge motion in dna will be introduced in the next section , considering charge hopping , possible fluctuations in structure and their interactions .",
    "we will present the formation of a polaron in section iii , together with the study of polaron stability and proton delocalization in the hydrogen bonds . in section iv , we calculate the polaron diffusion coefficient and the results will be compared with the experimental reaction rate of charge transfer in dna .",
    "section v contains our conclusions .",
    "although biologically functional dna is an aperiodic system , we will focus here on a periodic dna structure .",
    "since the polaron state discussed here is highly localized ( see below ) , we believed that the periodicity condition is not very constraining when we consider charge transfer over intermediate distance .",
    "in fact , in some experimental setups one looks for charge transfer between two g - c pairs which are separated by many ( periodic ) a - t pairs . as we can see in fig .",
    "@xmath3 , following hole injection into the system , the charge localizes in the g - c base pair but can migrate from one unit cell to another .",
    "the essential ingredients in our model are ( @xmath4 ) the electronic system , that realizes the charge conduction ;  ( @xmath5 ) the possible structural fluctuations , which include phonons and proton motion in hydrogen bonds ; and ( @xmath6 ) the coupling between the charges and the structure .    for a non - interacting electron system ,",
    "the tight - binding model is extensively used in many theories of dna charge transport @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8(@xmath9 ) is the electron annihilation(creation ) operator at the @xmath4-th site and @xmath10 is the overlap integral of electronic @xmath0 orbitals between two nearest neighboring sites .",
    "( we disregard the electron spin since we are not describing magnetic phenomena here . ) the energy spectrum of the electrons is @xmath11 giving a bandwidth @xmath12  , where @xmath13 is the lattice spacing and the wave vectors @xmath14 is @xmath15 with @xmath16 as an integer and the system size @xmath17 . in the continuum limit ( @xmath18 ) , the hamiltonian describes the kinetic energy of charge particles with a bloch wavefunction and effective mass @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is used to replace the overlap integral @xmath10 of the discrete model .    for the phonon part of the structural fluctuations in dna , we consider that the relative motions between two different base pairs can be represented by an acoustical phonon mode and the vibrational motion inside a base pair by optical phonons @xcite .",
    "these modes represent lattice distortions , such as sliding , twisting or bending .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes these modes is : @xmath21   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{i}\\left [ \\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{2m}+\\frac{1% } { 2}m\\omega _ { 0}^{2}v_{i}^{2}\\right ]   \\ , , \\label{phonons}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22  and @xmath23 are the lattice displacement and the internal vibration coordinate of the @xmath4-th unit cell , @xmath24  and @xmath25  are their conjugated momentum , respectively , @xmath26 is the mass of a unit cell , @xmath27 the oscillation frequency of the optical phonon and the dispersion relation of the acoustical motion is : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the sound velocity along the chain .",
    "the charge coupling to acoustical phonons is given by the su - schrieffer - heeger model @xcite and the interaction with optical phonons is described via the molecular crystal model of holstein @xcite .",
    "thus the total electron - phonon interactions of dna system is @xmath30 where @xmath31  and @xmath32 are the coupling constants . in systems with half - filled conduction band , such as an one - dimensional @xmath0-conjugated polymers , the ssh term generates dimerization in the ground state ( peierls instability ) and forms solitons in the excited states @xcite .",
    "however , for dna , considered here as a band insulator , both interactions can generate lattice distortions and lead to polaron formation when a charge is doped into the molecule .",
    "the second term in ( [ phonon interactions ] ) usually induces small polarons in ionic crystals .    for the proton motion in the hydrogen bonds we use a two - level system to describe the tunneling behavior ( see fig .",
    "@xmath33 ) @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are pauli matrices , @xmath37 is the energy bias between the two localized proton states and @xmath38 is the tunneling matrix element .",
    "the ratio @xmath39 provides information of the proton motion in the system .",
    "when the ratio is small , the protons are localized in one side of the hydrogen bonds . however , when it is large , the protons are delocalized . as we can see in fig .",
    "@xmath33(a ) , the normal g - c base pair is the lower energy state and its tautomeric form ( g*@xmath40c * ) is an excited state . when @xmath41 , the probability of having a tautomeric form is extremely small .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "@xmath33(b ) , the radical cation of a g - c base pair has almost the same energy as its tautomeric form@xmath42@xcite , i.e. , @xmath43  . in this case",
    ", the proton state becomes delocalized in the hydrogen bonds .    to model the coupling between the protons in the hydrogen bond and the charges in the dna strand , we use : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the coupling intensity and @xmath46 is the number of charges on the @xmath4-th site .",
    "when the proton is in the lower energy state ( @xmath47 ) or there is no charge around the hydrogen bond ( @xmath48 ) , the coupling vanishes .",
    "although there are many hydrogen bonds in the base pairs of a unit cell , it is not necessary to consider all of the possible proton transfers since at room temperature the transitions to the tautomeric forms are very unlikely to occur .",
    "we only need to consider the hydrogen bond with the most probable proton transfer with charge injection into the unit cell , i.e. , only one two - level system is required for each unit cell .    by giving a total hamiltonian as the sum of ( [ tight - binding model ] ) , ( [ phonons ] ) , ( [ phonon interactions ] ) , ( [ two - level system ] ) and ( [ proton interaction ] ) we have our complete model for charge motion in dna .",
    "although polaron formation has already been considered very important for charge motion in dna @xcite , the effect of the proton motion in the hydrogen bonds has not yet been discussed in the literature . here , to investigate this factor",
    ", we analytically solve our model by taking the hamiltonians into the continuum limit .",
    "the carrier wavefunction @xmath49 and the phonon modes @xmath50 ,  @xmath51 are considered as functions of time and a continuous coordinate @xmath52 .the equations of motion for the variables in the problem can be studied in the semiclassical limit ( @xmath53 ) and by a change of variables @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the polaron velocity . in this case , we have @xcite : @xmath56 , \\end{array } \\label{lorentz transformation}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the binding energy of the polaron , and the problem reduces to a nonlinear schrdinger equation for the wavefunction @xmath58  : @xmath59 where @xmath60  is the mass density @xmath61 , @xmath62  represents the positions of the protons in the hydrogen bonds and is expressed by @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "the interaction energy between the carriers and protons , @xmath65 , is significant only when the charge trapped by the hydrogen bond causes proton delocalization .",
    "therefore , for small value of @xmath38 compared to @xmath37  , we can use the approximation : @xmath66 from the continuity of the polaron wavefunction , equation ( [ nonlinear shordinger equation ] ) can be analytically solved and the solution is found as combinations of jacobian elliptic functions .",
    "when the charge coupling with the protons is small , i.e. , @xmath67(where @xmath68  is the maximum value of @xmath58 ) , the polaron is purely formed by the interaction with phonons and the proton motion has no effect on the wavefunction or the binding energy .",
    "the ground state solution is simply expressed as @xmath69 and the binding energy is @xmath70 where   @xmath71 .\\ ] ] it is easy to see that @xmath72 represents the size of the polaron . to calculate the binding energy and the size of a static polaron",
    ", we consider that a hole carrier is doped into a poly(g)-poly(c ) dna .",
    "the effective mass of the carrier @xmath73 is of order @xmath74 kg ( @xmath75 the mass of a electron )  obtained from band structure calculations , which give a bandwidth of about @xmath76 ev @xcite . for the charge coupling strength @xmath77 generated by the acoustical and optical phonons in ( [ nonlinear shordinger equation ] ) , since the energy difference between the adiabatic and vertical ionization potentials of a g - c base pair is about @xmath78 ev @xcite , the optical part is given as about @xmath78 ev @xmath79 ev  . the acoustical part is assumed to be smaller , so we consider the value of the coupling strength as approximately @xmath80 ev  . from these results , we find that the polaron is @xmath81  wide  with binding energy @xmath82 ev and , therefore , it is entirely localized in a base pair .",
    "for the weak coupling to hydrogen bonds ( @xmath83 ev ) , the protons are localized in their original positions and the tautomeric base pair is unlikely to be generated .",
    "as the coupling constant @xmath45 becomes larger , proton transfer can be induced since the charge trapped into a base pair reduces the bias energy @xmath37  dramatically . by considering the bias energy",
    "@xmath84  and the tunneling matrix element @xmath38 of order @xmath85 ev @xmath86 and @xmath87 ev @xmath86 , respectively , we find that the binding energy of the polaron @xmath57 is @xmath88 ev for @xmath89 ev , which is more stable than the above with the same values of the effective mass @xmath19 and the coupling strength @xmath90 .",
    "the ground state wavefunction consists of two parts , the central and the external . for the external part",
    ", the wavefunction behaves as a hyperbolic secant function since it should vanish as @xmath91 . in the central part of the polaron",
    ", the wavefunction is described by  a jacobian elliptic functions of second kind  and the proton in the hydrogen bond is delocalized since the value of @xmath62  is large . for the base pair in the center of the polaron , its tautomeric form can be easily induced .",
    "the relation between the coupling constant @xmath45 and the binding energy is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath92 , where we have @xmath93 ev   for the value of the coupling strength @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath94 is larger than @xmath95 ev , the proton becomes delocalized in the hydrogen bond and the charge binding energy increases rapidly .",
    "the local deformations from the charge interaction with phonons can also stabilize the polaron as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath96 with @xmath97",
    "the increase of the couplings @xmath31  or @xmath98  also induces proton transfer since the carrier is strongly attracted in the base pair .",
    "the effect of proton transfer has been observed in experiments on the influence of mismatches in the dna long - range charge transfer @xcite .",
    "mismatched base pairs are found to cause a large drop in the charge transfer rate due to the weakening of hydrogen bonds . for a normal g - c base pair ,",
    "the positive charge in the radical cation can be distributed by both nucleotides through the delocalization of protons . however , mismatched guanine , which leads to a fast deprotonation to the surrounding water , might induce a bound state with lower energy .",
    "therefore , the charge is localized in the mismatched base pair and the long - range charge transfer is interrupted .",
    "the dynamic properties of a polaron induced by the carrier interaction with acoustical and optical phonons in one dimension were explored many years ago @xcite . in the strong coupling limit , it is found that the polaron moves as a brownian particle interacting with the light particles of the environmental heat bath . to investigate these results in the context of dna",
    ", we first consider the case without proton coupling ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) .",
    "the damping parameter of the optical polaron motion at high temperature ( @xmath100 ) is given by @xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath102  is the classical polaron mass : @xmath103 and @xmath104 here , we use @xmath105 as the binding energy from the optical phonons . for acoustical phonons we have the damping parameter : @xmath106 where the classical polaron mass  for the acoustical case is @xmath107 and @xmath108 with @xmath109 the binding energy from the acoustical phonons .",
    "the random walk motion of the polaron in the long time limit ( @xmath110 or @xmath111 ) is governed by the one - dimensional diffusion equation : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the density of the particles and @xmath114 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the relation between the damping parameter and the diffusion coefficient is given by the einstein relation : @xmath115 where we use @xmath116 for the diffusion coefficient in the optical ( acoustical ) case .",
    "as we can see from the scheme of the multiple - step hopping mechanism in fig .",
    "@xmath3 , the hole hopping from a g - c base pair to its nearest neighbor can be viewed as an oxidation - reduction reaction with a rate constant @xmath14 . according to the rate law of a first - order reaction ,",
    "the concentration of the charge at the @xmath4-th g - c base pair , @xmath117 , is described by @xmath118 in the continuum limit , when the distance between two nearest neighboring g - c base pairs , @xmath13 , is very small , we have @xmath119 \\rightarrow ka^{2}\\frac{% \\partial ^{2}n_{i}}{\\partial x^{2}}.\\ ] ] by comparing this equation with ( [ diffusion equaiton ] ) , we have the correspondence from the diffusion coefficient in the continuous medium to the charge transfer rate of the discrete model : @xmath120 thus , instead of a diffusion coefficient , we can use the discrete characteristic @xmath10 to estimate the rate constant . from ( [ diffusion coefficients ] ) and ( [ gama o ] ) , we have @xmath121 by the correspondence ( [ correspondence ] ) , the rate constant for the optical case is obtained as @xmath122 we can also derive the rate constant for the thermal activation by the acoustical phonons as @xmath123    for poly(g)-poly(c ) dna , the oscillation frequency is @xmath124 hz from the theoretical and experimental results @xcite . the theoretical calculation has shown the valence bandwidth of @xmath125 ev @xcite . by considering that the binding energy @xmath105 is about @xmath126 ev , we have the reaction rate @xmath127 . this estimate is in agreement with the experimental result for electron transfer in dna which gives @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "this low reaction rate is generated by two factors in equation ( [ rate constant for optical case ] ) , the hopping probability @xmath129 and the oscillation frequency @xmath130 . due to the strong structural fluctuations at room temperature",
    ", the charge hopping could only happen when the local structure of the polaron achieves an effective configuration @xcite .",
    "for each period of structural oscillation , the probability to have a successful hopping is of order @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the charge transfer rate is determined by the frequency of reaching the effective configuration @xmath130  and the probability @xmath132 .",
    "the behavior of the incoherent charge hopping is now described by the polaron motion under thermal fluctuations .    another way to study",
    "the diffusion coefficent in the optical case is to consider the mean square displacement : @xmath133 and we may rewrite ( [ diffusion coefficients in optical case ] ) as : @xmath134 now , we can see that , for every oscillation period @xmath135 , the collisions by the light particles from the environment spread the polaron with the mean - square displacement @xmath136 .",
    "the diffusion in the continuous medium , however , needs to be corrected when we make the correspondence since the size of the polaron is smaller than the lattice spacing .",
    "therefore , the real reaction rate of charge transfer between the discrete base pairs should be smaller than our results .",
    "nevertheless , the order of the charge transfer rate can still be estimated from the simple expression : @xmath137    we can also estimate the reaction rate @xmath138 in the acoustical case from the experimental data for the sound velocity @xmath139 cm s @xcite . assuming @xmath140 ev  , we have @xmath141 s@xmath86 which is four order of magnitude larger than @xmath142 .",
    "a faster charge transfer rate is expected if the polaron is purely generated by the acoustical phonons . however ,",
    "if optical phonons or proton transfer are involved , a smaller value of the reaction rate should be expected due to the increase of the binding energy in those cases .",
    "in this paper we studied the charge conduction in periodic dna focusing on the effect of the structural fluctuations which includes the proton motion in hydrogen bonds .",
    "we found that the charge trapped by hydrogen bonds or phonons can generate a polaron state and the coupling to the protons can induce proton transfer in a base pair .",
    "the polaron moving with small velocity is seen as a brownian particle colliding with the light particles of the environment .",
    "this diffusion process corresponds to a multiple - step hopping mechanism in the discrete model . from this correspondence ,",
    "the reaction rate of the long - range charge transfer in dna can be derived from the diffusion coefficient , and it was found that the result predicted in the optical case is in agreement with the experimental results .",
    "although we did not include the effect of proton transfer on the polaron diffusion , it is expected to be crucial in the dynamics of charge hopping . from electrochemical experiments",
    "@xcite , a decrease of charge transport along the dna with mismatched base pairs is found .",
    "this behavior might be explained by the effect of the proton motions in the hydrogen bonds and we will explore this possibility in future work .",
