    "studying protein structures can reveal relevant structural and functional information which may not be derived from protein sequences alone . during recent years",
    ", various methods that study protein structures have been elaborated based on diverse types of descriptor such as profiles @xcite , spatial motifs @xcite and others . yet , the exponential growth of online databases such as the protein data bank ( pdb ) @xcite , cath @xcite , scop @xcite and others , arises an urgent need for more accurate methods that will help to better understand the studied phenomenons such as protein evolution , functions , etc .    in this scope",
    ", proteins have recently been interpreted as graphs of amino acids and studied based on graph theory concepts @xcite .",
    "this representation enables the use of graph mining techniques to study protein structures in a graph perspective .",
    "in fact , in graph mining , any problem or object under consideration is represented in the form of nodes and edges and studied based on graph theory concepts @xcite .",
    "one of the powerful and current trends in graph mining is frequent subgraph discovery .",
    "it aims to discover subgraphs that frequently occur in a graph dataset and use them as patterns to describe the data .",
    "these patterns are lately analyzed by domain experts to reveal interesting information hidden in the original graphs , such as discovering pathways in metabolic networks @xcite , identifying residues that play the role of hubs in the protein and stabilize its structure @xcite , etc .",
    "the graph isomorphism test is one of the main bottlenecks of frequent subgraph mining . yet , many efficient and scalable algorithms have been proposed in the literature and made it feasible for instance ffsm @xcite , gspan @xcite , gaston @xcite , etc .",
    "unfortunately , the exponential number of discovered frequent subgraphs is another serious issue that still needs more attention @xcite , since it may hinder or even make any further analysis unfeasible due to time , resources , and computational limitations .",
    "for example , in an aids antiviral screen dataset composed of 422 chemical compounds , there are more than 1 million frequent substructures when the minimum support is 5% .",
    "this problem becomes even more serious with graphs of higher density such as those representing protein structures .",
    "in fact , the issues raised from the huge number of frequent subgraphs are mainly due to two factors , namely _ redundancy _ and _ significance _ @xcite .",
    "redundancy in a frequent subgraph set is caused by structural and/or semantic similarity , since most discovered subgraphs differ slightly in structure and may infer similar or even the same meaning .",
    "moreover , the significance of the discovered frequent subgraphs is only related to frequency .",
    "this yields an urgent need for efficient approaches allowing to select relevant patterns among the large set of frequent subgraphs .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel selection approach which selects a subset of representative patterns from a set of labeled subgraphs , we term them _",
    "unsubstituted patterns_. in order to select these unsubstituted patterns and to shrink the large size of the initial set of frequent subgraphs , we exploit a specific domain knowledge , which is the substitution between amino acids represented as nodes .",
    "though , the main contribution of this work is to define a new approach for mining a representative summary of the set of frequent subgraphs by incorporating a specific background domain knowledge which is the ability of substitution between nodes labels in the graph . in this work ,",
    "we apply the proposed approach on protein structures because of the availability of substitution matrices in the literature , however , it can be considered as general framework for other applications whenever it is possible to define a matrix quantifying the possible substitution between the labels .",
    "our approach can also be used on any type of subgraph structure such as cliques , trees and paths ( sequences ) .",
    "in addition , it can be easily coupled with other pattern selection methods such as discrimination or orthogonality based approaches .",
    "moreover , this approach is unsupervised and can help in various mining tasks , unlike other approaches that are supervised and dedicated to a specific task such as classification .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : related_works ] discusses the recent related works in the area of pattern selection for subgraphs . in section [ sec : unsub_patt_selection ] , we present the background of our work and we define the preliminary concepts as well as the main algorithm of our approach . then , section [ sec : experiments ] describes the characteristics of the used data and the experimental settings .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents the obtained experimental results and the discussion .",
    "it is worth noting that in the rest of the paper , we use the following terms interchangeably : spatial motifs , patterns , subgraphs .",
    "recently , several approaches have been proposed for pattern selection in subgraph mining . in @xcite , authors proposed origami , an approach for both subgraph discovery and selection .",
    "first they randomly mine a sample of maximal frequent subgraphs , then straightforwardly they select an @xmath0-orthogonal ( non - redundant ) , @xmath1-representative subgraphs from the mined set . the leap algorithm proposed in @xcite tries to locate patterns that individually have high discrimination power , using an objective function score that measures each pattern s significance .",
    "another approach termed gpls was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it attempts to select a set of informative subgraphs in order to rapidly build a classifier .",
    "gpls uses the mathematical concept of partial least squares regression to create latent variables allowing a better prediction .",
    "com @xcite is another subgraph selection approach which follows a process of pattern mining and classifier learning .",
    "it mines co - occurrence rules .",
    "then , based on the co - occurrence information it assembles weak features in order to generate strong ones . in @xcite , authors proposed a feature selection approach termed cork . to find frequent subgraphs",
    ", it uses the state - of - the - art approach gspan .",
    "then using a submodular quality function , it selects among them the subset of subgraphs that are most discriminative for classification . in @xcite , authors designed lpgbcmp , a general model which selects clustered features by considering the structure relationship between subgraph patterns in the functional space .",
    "the selected subgraphs are used as weak classifiers ( base learners ) to obtain high quality classification models .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , in all existing subgraph selection approaches @xcite , the selection is usually based on structural similarity @xcite and/or statistical measures ( e.g. frequency and coverage ( closed @xcite , maximal @xcite ) , discrimination @xcite , ... ) . yet , the _ prior _ information and knowledge about the domain are often ignored .",
    "however , these prior knowledge may help building dedicated approaches that best fit the studied data .",
    "statistical pattern selection methods have been widely used to resolve the dimensionality problem when the number of discovered patterns is too large . however , these methods are too generic and do not consider the specificity of the domain and the used data .",
    "we believe that in many contexts , it would be important to incorporate the background knowledge about the domain in order to create approaches that best fit the considered data . in proteomics , a protein structure is composed by the folding of a set of amino acids . during evolution , amino acids can substitute each other .",
    "the scores of substitution between pairs of amino acids were quantified by biologists in the literature in the form of substitution matrices such as blosum62 @xcite .",
    "our approach uses the substitution information given in the substitution matrices in order to select a subset of unsubstituted patterns that summarizes the whole set of frequent subgraphs .",
    "we consider the selected patterns as the representative ones .    the main idea of our approach",
    "is based on node substitution .",
    "since the nodes of a protein graph represent amino acids , though , using a substitution matrix , it would be possible to quantify the substitution between two given subgraphs .",
    "starting from this idea , we define a similarity function that measures the distance between a given pair of subgraphs .",
    "then , we preserve only one subgraph from each pair having a similarity score greater or equal to a user specified threshold such that the preserved subgraphs represent the set of representative unsubstituted patterns .",
    "an overview of the proposed approach is illustrated in figure [ fig : pattern_mining ] and a more detailed description is given in the following sections .",
    "the substitution between amino acids was also used in the literature but for sequential feature extraction from protein sequences in @xcite , where the authors proposed a novel feature extraction approach termed _ ddsm _ for protein sequence classification .",
    "their approach is restricted to protein sequences and generates every subsequence substituting another one .",
    "in other words , ddsm eliminates any pattern substituted by another one and which itself does not substitute any other one .",
    "we believe that their approach does not guarantee an optimal summarization since its output may still contain patterns that substitute each other .",
    "in addition , they do consider negative substitution scores as impossible substitutions which is biologically not true since negative scores are only expressing the less likely substitutions , which obviously does not mean that they are impossible .",
    "moreover , ddsm is limited to protein sequences and does not handle more complex structures such as the protein tertiary structure . our approach overcomes these shortcomings , since it can handle both protein sequences and structures ( since a sequence can be seen as a line graph ) .",
    "in addition , it consider both the positive and negative scores of the matrix . moreover , our approach generates a set of representative unsubstituted patterns ensuring an optimal summarization of the initial set . besides",
    ", it is unsupervised and can be exploited in classification as well as other analysis and knowledge discovery contexts unlike ddsm which is dedicated to classification .      in this section",
