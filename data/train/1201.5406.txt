    "<S> in contrast to previous studies of this kind , the effects of the dipolar and quadrupolar interactions of the muon with nearby nuclei are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> zf-@xmath3sr spectra with a high number of counts were also recorded to determine whether a magnetically ordered phase exists in dilute regions of the sample . despite these efforts </S>",
    "<S> , we find no evidence for static magnetic order of any kind in the pseudogap region above the hole - doping concentration @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> a distinctive feature of high transition temperature ( @xmath5 ) cuprate superconductors is the pseudogap region that exists above @xmath5 and over a wide range of doping . for some time </S>",
    "<S> there has been much debate on whether the pseudogap is a manifestation of a phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has been demonstrated that the onset of the pseudogap in optimally - doped pb@xmath6bi@xmath7sr@xmath8la@xmath9cuo@xmath10 at a temperature @xmath11 is likely a sign of a phase transition to a non - superconducting state with a broken symmetry.@xcite although this is not necessarily a magnetically ordered state , proposed orders for the pseudogap state include time - reversal symmetry breaking phases that contain ordered circulating orbital currents , which either break  @xcite or preserve  @xcite translational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest experimental evidence for an orbital - current phase are the the observations of an unusual translational - symmetry preserving magnetic order in yba@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 and hgba@xmath12cuo@xmath15 by spin - polarized neutron diffraction,@xcite which bear some resemblance to the ordered @xmath16 circulating - current phase proposed in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth pointing out , however , that by extrapolation the onset of this orbital - like magnetic order is expected to occur near @xmath5 at optimal doping , and hence its relationship to the phase transition reported in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> is unclear . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , to date such orbital - like magnetic order has not been observed in any cuprate beyond a hole doping of @xmath17 , whereas the @xmath16 phase is predicted to persist up to @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the experimental techniques used in the above studies , local probes of magnetism , such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and zero - field muon spin relaxation ( zf-@xmath3sr ) provide information on the magnetic volume fraction . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , @xmath19y nmr experiments on y@xmath12ba@xmath2cu@xmath20o@xmath21 , @xcite zeeman perturbed nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) measurements of yba@xmath12cu@xmath2o@xmath22,@xcite and zf-@xmath3sr experiments on yba@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 ( ref </S>",
    "<S> .  , ) and la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( ref .  ) have found no evidence for the onset of magnetic order at the pseudogap temperature @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> one exception is the finding of anomalous magnetic order by zf-@xmath3sr @xcite in the same yba@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath24 single crystal studied in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic order is characterized by an onset temperature and an average local dipolar magnetic field that are in quantitative agreement with the orbital - like magnetic order detected by polarized neutron diffraction . yet </S>",
    "<S> the zf-@xmath3sr measurements clearly show this form of magnetic order existing in only about @xmath25 of the sample , suggesting that it is associated with a minority phase in lower quality samples .    </S>",
    "<S> orbital - like magnetic order has also been observed in la@xmath26sr@xmath27cuo@xmath2 by polarized neutron diffraction , @xcite but is less pronounced than the long - range magnetic order that has been reported in the pseudogap regions of yba@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 ( ref .  , ) and hgba@xmath12cuo@xmath15 ( ref .  ) . in particular , the magnetic order in la@xmath26sr@xmath27cuo@xmath2 is short range , two ( rather than three ) dimensional , and occurs at a temperature far below @xmath23 . yet </S>",
    "<S> no such magnetic order was observed in a zf-@xmath3sr study of @xmath28 samples by macdougall _ et al._@xcite nevertheless , the subtle nature of the magnetic order observed in la@xmath26sr@xmath27cuo@xmath2 warrants a more precise zf-@xmath3sr search to verify its existence and determine whether it is an intrinsic property of the pseudogap phase of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> here we report two significant advances in the application of zf-@xmath3sr to search for magnetic order in the pseudogap region of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> first , we accurately determine the interactions of the positive muon ( @xmath29 ) with the nuclear spin system , allowing us to identify any residual relaxation of the zf-@xmath3sr spectrum that could be ascribed to static magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> in doing so we have accurately identified the muon stopping site . </S>",
    "<S> second , we have acquired zf-@xmath3sr spectra of higher statistics than in previous works , enabling a search for dilute or short - range magnetic order . </S>"
