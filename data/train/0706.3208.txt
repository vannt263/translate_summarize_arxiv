    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) provides the basis for our understanding of hadronic matter at its most fundamental level . as such , mathematically stable solutions to the exact equations of qcd represent stable physical particles . because extreme external conditions such as high temperatures , strong chemical potentials , or powerful electromagnetic fields couple to quark and gluon fields , they alter the mathematically stable solutions of qcd . calculating the corresponding response of the various physical observables of hadronic matter in the presence of these extreme conditions is a central question at the core of modern nuclear physics .",
    "research along these lines has mainly focused on the effects of high temperature or high density ( or equivalently chemical potential ) on qcd matter .",
    "the response of qcd observables to very large electromagnetic fields has undergone less extensive study , but has potentially equally interesting consequences .    since electromagnetic fields couple directly to quarks and not to gluons",
    ", it is natural to focus on intensive observables built from quark fields .",
    "it is clearly essential to understand the behavior of the chiral condensate , @xmath3 , since the chiral condensate quantifies one of the most salient features of qcd  the spontaneous breaking of chiral invariance .",
    "to date the response of the chiral condensate to either constant electric and constant magnetic fields has only been studied in a variety of low energy models and effective field theories .",
    "all calculations of the shift of the chiral condensate in the presence of strong magnetic fields yield an enhanced chiral condensate .",
    "these calculations include those done in the various low energy models of qcd at or close to the chiral limit @xcite and in the model - independent calculations @xcite of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath4pt ) @xcite .",
    "shifts due to `` constant '' electric fields are not as well studied .",
    "even though calculations made in the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite show that a constant electric field reduces the chiral condensate , it seems that this has yet to be verified in a model - independent calculation .",
    "all of the calculations generally have an enhanced spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( s@xmath4sb ) due to a magnetic field .",
    "we choose to focus here on @xmath4pt , following @xcite , because as the effective theory for qcd its results should be more generally applicable .",
    "shushpanov and smilga@xcite find a result which they call a `` low - energy theorem , '' holding in the strict chiral limit at one loop in @xmath4pt , to be @xmath5 by design , @xmath4pt is _ universally _ applicable to all theories with underlying chiral symmetry and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "thus for fields sufficiently small , the @xmath4pt result @xmath6 will be the leading order result .",
    "the principal results of this paper is the generalization of the `` low energy theorem''@xcite in eq .",

    "this result has been extended to @xmath4pt at two loops @xcite , increasing the accuracy of the theoretical predictions for large , pure magnetic fields in the limit where @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to note that the assumption that @xmath1 may place a severe constraint on these results . while results obtained in this theoretical limit are certainly interesting , it is not necessary to impose such a condition in order to formulate a controlled expansion .",
    "consistent chiral expansions can only be formulated when both @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be treated as low mass scales compared to @xmath10 .",
    "however , nothing in the formulation fixes the ratio @xmath11 which can be kept arbitrary .",
    "the low energy theorem of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lowenergy ] ) must be regarded as the leading term in the full chiral expansion restricted to a regime where @xmath12 .",
    "physically , @xmath13 mev , and it is an open question whether the result derived at @xmath7 accurately describes observable shifts in nature for any given values of @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , it is unclear that there is _ any _ domain of validity for eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lowenergy ] ) , since it is not clear that it is possible to simultaneously have @xmath12 while allowing @xmath8 to remain within the regime where chiral perturbation theory to one loop is accurate .",
    "most simply , the condition for @xmath4pt to be applicable is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is any relevant light scale in the problem  mass , magnetic field , external momenta , etc . in practice",
    ", one might generically expect @xmath17 , which is a small expansion parameter when only one condition is required .",
    "difficulties arise , however , when one artificially imposes the extra condition that @xmath18 , which will then in practice require the tight hierarchy @xmath19 .",
    "the region of magnetic fields which satisfy this hierarchy will be at best rather narrow .",
    "we will show by explicit calculation , the general low energy theorem , valid for all values of @xmath11 , converges quite slowly to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lowenergy ] ) .",
    "it seems apparent that if an @xmath14 field is large enough to be in the regime of validity of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lowenergy ] ) , it would also be sufficiently large as to require the inclusion of higher - order operators in the chiral lagrangian . as a practical matter it is certainly far more useful to obtain a result valid for @xmath20 , and arbitrary @xmath11 .",
    "such a generalization greatly extends the regime of validity .",
    "thus , our principal result of providing a `` low energy theorem '' valid at all orders is @xmath11 is essential for having any useable result for the physical world .",
    "moreover , one expects that the coefficients are likely to be rather unfavorable in this case , given @xmath21 considerations which we will discuss briefly in the conclusion .",
    "an analogous situation can be found in the example of `` low - energy theorems '' for qcd at finite temperature .",
    "we present it here to emphasize that the theoretically elegant limit of @xmath1 is not always relevant in practice .",
    "@xcite argues that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lowenergy ] ) is a theorem in exactly the same sense that @xmath22 is a low energy theorem for the condensate which holds at low @xmath23 in the strict chiral limit @xcite . clearly eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t ] ) is formally valid only when the hierarchy of scales , @xmath24 , is satisfied .",
    "the range of validity for this hierarchy is similar to the one we find in our problem .",
    "also in analogy , while eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t ] ) is formally correct in the @xmath7 limit , it is never useful in describing a real system at any temperature : any temperature which is high enough to be much bigger than @xmath2 is also beyond the temperature of the qcd phase transition and thus outside the regime of validity of @xmath4pt .",
    "since the formula is derived with the assumption that @xmath1 and @xmath2 does not appear in the result , it must be the case that the expression is only valid for @xmath25 ; if it is of the same order as @xmath23 or greater , it will begin to play an increasingly important role in the result .",
    "thus , for @xmath23 of the order of tens of mev where ( [ eqn : t ] ) would be valid , @xmath2 is comparatively large enough to render ( [ eqn : t ] ) invalid .",
    "further , since @xmath26 mev , if @xmath27 mev then one is clearly in the quark - gluon plasma phase , and outside the range of @xmath28 .",
    "explicit calculations with the physical value of @xmath2 @xcite show conclusively that the``low energy theorem '' of eq .",

    "the pions do not interact , and one uses the appropriate non - interacting propagators for a constant external field . in this circumstance",
    ", the schwinger proper time formalism @xcite provides a natural framework to study the qcd chiral condensate in the presence of constant electromagnetic fields .",
    "the final issue we address in this paper is the generalization of the low energy theorem to include electric fields  either as pure electric fields or in situations where both @xmath31 and @xmath14 are present .",
    "the character of the shift of the condensate in the presence of a non - trivial electric field is fundamentally different from the shift in the presence of a pure magnetic field .",
    "this difference is essentially due to the famous schwinger mechanism , and is made manifestly clear within the context of the proper time formalism . within this formalism , it is a relatively straightforward exercise to evaluate the effective action for charged matter fields in the presence of a uniform electromagnetic field ( to one loop ) .",
    "poles appear in the effective action in the presence of a uniform electric field , which are conventionally interpreted as corresponding to spontaneous real @xmath32 pair creation out of the vacuum @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies an inherent local instability in a system containing a constant electric field .",
    "indeed , in light of the schwinger mechanism , a uniform field in such a system does not remain static , but naturally evolves via back - reactions over time @xcite . as a practical matter",
    ", the effect of pair creation in a constant electric field means that the field can only be considered as constant over length and time scales limited by the parameters of the problem .",
    "in contrast , a system with a constant magnetic field has no such instability , and the @xmath14 field can consistently be regarded as constant over time .",
    "in this section we compute the chiral condensate in an external magnetic field to one loop in chiral perturbation theory and to all orders in @xmath33 . recall that the chiral expansion is typically an expansion in @xmath34 , where @xmath16 is a momentum in the problem . since the external magnetic field is an isovector",
    ", it explicitly breaks chiral symmetry , and the expansion becomes an expansion in @xmath35 . since the scattering amplitude for pions at @xmath36 is zero at lowest order in the theory , the leading - order @xmath4pt result for the shift in the chiral condensate due to a magnetic field is simply the one - loop expression for non - interacting pions in a magnetic field . in conventional @xmath4pt counting ,",

    "the form of this integral simplifies dramatically in the chiral limit , where @xmath48 . after a routine calculation",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath49 is unity , reproducing the low energy theorem originally found in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , for our purposes , it is more interesting to note that there is a closed - form expression for this integral @xcite :    @xmath50    yielding an analytic result to one - loop order in @xmath4pt valid for any ratio of @xmath9 to @xmath51 .",
    "a comment about @xmath4pt to one - loop is useful at this stage .",
    "typically , one - loop graphs diverge and are only sensible in the context of a renormalization scheme including counterterms in the @xmath30 lagrangian .",
    "the present expression is finite . _",
    "a priori _ this does not mean that there can not be a finite contribution from a higher - order operator in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "direct inspection of the terms in the chiral lagrangian at @xmath30 reveals that no terms contribute to the shift in the condensate in an external field at tree level .",
    "as it happens , the first such term which contributes to the chiral condensate at tree level occurs at @xmath52 .",
    "accordingly , the lowest - order chiral lagrangian , @xmath53 , is sufficient to determine the shift in the condensate to the order which we are working .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : iplot ] , @xmath54 is plotted as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the convergence to unity is very slow .",
    "for example , even when @xmath56 is 30 , the exact one - loop expression is only 85% of the @xmath7 expression .",
    "this value for @xmath51 is already pushing the @xmath57 scale mentioned earlier .",
    "we can conclude , then , that any value of @xmath51 large enough for the `` low - energy theorem '' of ref",
    ".  @xcite to be close to the exact one - loop expression is likely to be near the region where the small - field limit breaks down and higher - order terms in @xmath4pt are important .",
    "therefore , while the low - energy theorem is formally correct , its assumptions remove its region of validity from the real world , which has a finite @xmath2 .",

    "as noted in the introduction , the @xmath4pt analysis to date has been restricted to constant magnetic fields .",
    "in contrast , the njl model calculations have been made for constant electric fields @xcite .",
    "formally , these njl calculations neglect an imaginary part which arose in the evaluation of the chiral condensate .",
    "the standard interpretation of the emergence of an imaginary part in the calculation of a purely real quantity is a signal that the state is not the true ground state of the system ; the state is regarded as unstable . in the mean - field njl case",
    "the instability is due to pair creation of constituent quarks .",
    "since this is a manifestation of the model s unphysical lack of confinement , one may argue that this may be neglected . as we shall see below an analogous issue",
    "arises in @xmath4pt at one loop , but in this case the imaginary parts are due to an instability in associated pion pair production and are undoubtedly physical .",
    "suppose that an electric field which is approximately uniform over a large region of space is suddenly turned on .",
    "this external electric field will cause both a real shift in the condensate and a local breakdown in the vacuum due to real @xmath59 pair emission . provided that the instability due to pair emission occurs over a much shorter time scale than the characteristic time with which the condensate responds , it is sensible to discuss shifts in the chiral condensate in the context of a `` constant '' electric field .",
    "moreover , for small @xmath31 fields , the rate of pair production scales with @xmath2 as @xmath60 , and is exponentially suppressed @xcite .",
    "thus , in the regime where @xmath61 time evolution due to the imaginary shift is very slow and the question of how the condensate responds to a spatially and temporally _ constant _ electric field remains sensible .",
    "the ratio of the calculated real to imaginary parts of the shift in the condensate is a crude indicator of whether the calculation of the real part is meaningful ; we trust the result only if the real part dominates .",
    "when the imaginary part becomes comparable to the real part , the instability is significant and the calculation of the real part of the shift is unreliable .    our goal in this section is to calculate the shift of the condensate in an external electric field to one loop in @xmath4pt .",
    "qualitatively , the electric field case and the magnetic field case are quite different , though they are both derived from eq .",

    ", we will adopt the usual convention for the schwinger mechanism @xcite : we make the substitution @xmath73 in the integrand .",
    "this renders the expression for the shift mathematically well defined ; physically it is the regime associated with pair creation from the electric field .",
    "the integral expression for @xmath74 makes it manifestly clear how instabilities in the system arise in the presence of a uniform electric field .",
    "the infinite number of poles with non - trivial residues along the integration path allow the integral to be separated into a real principal value part and a purely imaginary part proportional to the sum of residues of the poles .",

    "thus , though higher order terms in the expansion may appear to drop with @xmath120 , due to inverse powers of @xmath121 , this is not actually always the case@xcite .",
    "one question is whether or not the large @xmath120 and chiral limits commute for @xmath122 .",
    "it would hardly be surprising if the limits do not commute as there are many well - known examples in qcd of non - commuting limits @xcite . in any case",
    ", the njl results are useful as a hint that the region of validity for @xmath4pt might not be as clean cut as might be hoped .",
    "higher - order terms in the @xmath4pt expansion which are not @xmath21 suppressed can cause the expansion to converge more slowly than would otherwise be expected .",
    "thus , another motivation for working to higher order is provided by the non - trivial @xmath120 dependence of the lecs noted above .",
    "the calculations done here came entirely from a pion loop , and meson loops are generically suppressed by factors of @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , tree diagrams in the chiral lagrangian can yield leading order results in the @xmath21 expansion @xcite . as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : mag ] , it is typical for tree graphs from the @xmath30 chiral lagrangian to contribute at the same order in the chiral expansion as one - pion - loop graphs .",
    "however , for the shift in the chiral condensate , there are no terms in the @xmath29 lagrangian which contribute at tree level .",
    "this is not the case at the next order in @xmath4pt where tree graphs in @xmath123 lagrangian do contribute @xcite ; it is easy to see these contributions come in at leading order in the @xmath21 expansion .",
    "an analysis of the actual impact of these leading - order @xmath120 terms may shed light on whether or not the @xmath120 expansion can indicate a slower convergence of @xmath4pt .    in conclusion",
    ", we have numerically examined the shift in the qcd chiral condensate due to an electromagnetic field in the framework of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we find that the low energy theorem in ( [ eqn : lowenergy ] ) is indeed accurate at large @xmath58 .",
    "however , a field which is large enough for this limit to apply is large enough that an expansion in @xmath124 is no longer valid .",
    "these results continue to hold in the presence of a small electric field .",
    "we are thus able to demonstrate , in a model independent way , that uniform electric fields tend to suppress s@xmath4sb .",
    "however , when the magnitude of the electric field becomes comparable to that of the magnetic field ( in the frame where they are both parallel ) , the calculations begin to break down due to the imaginary shift which corresponds to local instabilities and charged pair creation .",
