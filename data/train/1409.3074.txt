    "massive gravity is a candidate of modified gravity which explains the current accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite .",
    "a linear theory of massive graviton was first considered by fierz and pauli ( fp )  @xcite .",
    "this theory succeeded in excluding the extra ghost degree of freedom at linear order , but van dam , veltman , and zakharov suggested that this theory does not reduce to general relativity ( gr ) even in the massless limit  @xcite .",
    "however , vainshtein showed that this problem is caused by omitting the nonlinear effects  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , nonlinear extensions of the fp theory have been actively considered . however , for a long time , these nonlinear theories had suffered from the boulware deser ( bd ) ghost problem  @xcite , which states that the theories have the extra ghost degree of freedom in addition to the usual 5 degrees of freedom of massive spin-2 .    in order to see the bd ghost explicitly , the stckelberg formalism is very useful  @xcite . in stckelberg language ,",
    "the physical degrees of freedom are decomposed into helicity-0 , helicity-1 , and helicity-2 modes .",
    "the origin of the bd ghost mode is understood as the higher order equation of motion for the helicity-0 mode . in refs .",
    "@xcite , de rham , gabadadze , and tolley ( drgt ) constructed the mass potential in which the self - interactions of helicity-0 mode is tuned to be a total divergence , leaving a second - order equation of motion for the helicity-0 mode .",
    "it can be seen that after a field redefinition the action for the helicity-0 mode indeed reduces to the galileon form  @xcite clearly having the second - order equation of motion .",
    "thus , this theory is bd ghost free . massive gravity with this mass potential",
    "is called the drgt theory . hassan and",
    "rosen investigated drgt massive gravity by means of the hamiltonian analysis , and proved that the drgt theory is free of the bd ghost even away from the decoupling limit  @xcite .",
    "in addition , they generalized drgt massive gravity on a flat fiducial metric to the theory on a general fiducial metric , and proved that the theory is also free of the bd ghost using the same method  @xcite .",
    "although formal hamiltonian analysis is sufficient to prove the absence of ghost , it is interesting to show this explicitly at the level of equations of motion in a stckelberg language . in a complementary way to the hamiltonian analysis of hassan and rosen ,",
    "the stckelberg analysis in the flat fiducial case has been studied in detail in refs .",
    "moreover , the stckelberg analysis was extended to the curved fiducial case : de rham and renaux - petel studied the de sitter fiducial case  @xcite , while fasiello and tolley analyzed the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker fiducial case  @xcite .",
    "however , the stckelberg analysis has not been performed so far in the general fiducial case .",
    "( hamiltonian analysis in stckelberg language is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in this paper , we discuss the stckelberg analysis in the drgt theory with a completely general fiducial metric .",
    "first , we extend the definition of the perturbation of the stckelberg field in a covariant manner . using this definition ,",
    "we expand the action in terms of the perturbed quantities up to fourth order .",
    "next , we extend the decoupling limit of the flat case to that of a curved one by scaling the curvature scale .",
    "finally , we show that , in this extended decoupling limit , the equation of motion for the helicity-0 mode @xmath3 does not include higher derivatives of @xmath3 , which clarifies in a different and complementary way the reason why the bd ghost is absent even in the curved fiducial case .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",

    "[ sec : cov ] , we develop a covariant stckelberg analysis with a general fiducial metric and apply it to drgt massive gravity . in sec.[sec : dec ] , we derive the decoupling limit at the energy scale @xmath0 and show that the equation of motion for @xmath3 remains of second order in derivatives . the final section is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "the lagrangian for nonlinear massive gravity is composed of the einstein - hilbert term and the drgt mass terms : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass of the graviton @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 with a fixed background metric @xmath8 .",

    "the matrix @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a fixed symmetric matrix that is called a fiducial metric .",
    "generally speaking , a background metric @xmath19 on which we define a graviton has nothing to do with the fiducial metric @xmath18 , though in many cases @xmath18 is indeed a solution of the background equation of motion . in this paper , we take @xmath20 for simplicity , which enables us to expand the matrix @xmath21 perturbatively .",
    "the matrix @xmath16 and thus the drgt mass terms ( [ u2])([u4 ] ) explicitly break general covariance due to the presence of a fixed fiducial metric @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath18 can always be thought of as the `` gauge - fixed '' version of some covariant tensor field , which can be constructed using the well - known stckelberg trick @xcite : @xmath22 where a set of four ( we are working in four - dimensional spacetime ) stckelberg fields @xmath23 transform as scalars under a general coordinate transformation of spacetime .",
    "the fixed @xmath18 can be recovered by choosing the so - called `` unitary gauge '' with @xmath24 . by replacing @xmath18 with the covariant tensor field @xmath25",
    ", the drgt mass terms are promoted to scalars and thus the corresponding lagrangian ( [ drgt ] ) acquires general covariance .",
    "degrees of freedom in a gravity theory alternative to gr show themselves in a simpler manner in the so - called `` decoupling limit , '' where different types ( e.g. , helicities ) of degrees of freedom decouple from each other in some limit of energy scales . in the case of massive gravity ,",
    "the decoupling limit is taken as @xmath26 so that the nonlinearities in gravity get reduced , while keeping the energy scale @xmath27 with some @xmath28 fixed so that interactions arising above @xmath29 become irrelevant .",
    "when a fiducial metric is flat , all degrees of freedom are thus living in the flat minkowski background , which enables us to identify the ( stckelberg ) field - space lorentz symmetry with the spacetime global lorentz symmetry , while the later only arises in the decoupling limit . in this case , the set of four stckelberg fields @xmath30 transform as a vector under this identified global lorentz transformation . as a result ,",
    "the fields @xmath31 and @xmath3 , defined by @xmath32 transform as a vector and a scalar and encode the information of helicity-1 and helicity-0 modes of a massive graviton , respectively , in the decoupling limit .",
    "thus , in this limit , the requirement that the equation of motion for @xmath3 is of second order in derivatives ensures the absence of bd ghost  @xcite .",
    "the above argument , however , can not be applied simply to the case of a curved fiducial metric . indeed , a naive split  ( [ split ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ fiducial ] ) yields @xmath33 where @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 .",
    "if we would rewrite all partial derivatives in terms of `` covariant '' derivatives @xmath36 with respect to @xmath18 using @xmath37 and focus on the `` supposed - to - be '' helicity-0 mode @xmath3 defined by @xmath38 , we will get @xmath39 which is not explicitly covariant due to the presence of the christoffel symbols .",
    "in fact , as was well explained in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath31 and @xmath3 defined in the `` naive '' split ( [ split ] ) are neither vector nor scalar any longer , and do not capture the helicity-1 and helicity-0 modes correctly , either when going beyond the decoupling limit or when the fiducial metric is curved , which is the case we are dealing with in this paper .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is thus to develop a covariant formalism for the stckelberg expansion , through which the helicity modes can be characterized correctly and a decoupling limit analysis similar to the case of a flat fiducial metric can be consistently performed .",
    "for a general fiducial metric , the main difficulty in `` covariantly '' defining the goldstone modes @xmath34 and identifying the helicity modes is that , due to the loss of global symmetries , the identification of the internal and physical space does not make sense any longer .",
    "one exception is the case of the maximally symmetric fiducial metric considered in @xcite , where the identification of the helicity modes was made by embedding the @xmath40-dimensional ( a)ds into a @xmath41-dimensional minkowski background and then projecting back .",
    "this trick , however , can not be used for a general fiducial metric since embedding an arbitrary @xmath40-dimensional space into a @xmath41-dimensional minkowski one is not always possible .    in this paper",
    ", we employ an alternative approach based on the riemann normal coordinates ( rnc ) , which is in fact a standard approach to defining perturbations covariantly , as has been used in the well - known background field method ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "see also footnote 5 of @xcite , in which the use of riemann normal coordinate is suggested . the idea is to regard the stckelberg field as the diffeomorphism of the spacetime itself . for an alternative point of view of the field space , which yields exactly the same definition for the goldstone modes @xmath34 as in eq .",
