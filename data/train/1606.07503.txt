    "<S> teleportation of an entangled state , known as entanglement swapping , plays an essential role in quantum communication and network . here </S>",
    "<S> we report a field - test entanglement swapping experiment with two independent telecommunication band entangled photon - pair sources over the optical fibre network of hefei city . </S>",
    "<S> the two sources are located at two nodes 12 km apart and the bell - state measurement is performed in a third location which is connected to the two source nodes with 14.7 km and 10.6 km optical fibres . </S>",
    "<S> an average visibility of @xmath0 is observed in our experiment , which is high enough to infer a violation of bell inequality . with the entanglement swapping setup </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate a source independent quantum key distribution , which is also immune to any attack against detection in the measurement site .    with the help of quantum entanglement and bell state measurement ( bsm ) , entanglement swapping  @xcite can entangle two remote particles sharing no common history without interacting them . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , except for its interest in the fundamental study of quantum information science , entanglement swapping also constitutes a core part for quantum repeater  @xcite in long distance quantum communication  @xcite and quantum internet  @xcite for distributed quantum computation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for all these quantum communication applications , photons are the most suitable carriers due to its flying nature and robustness against environmental decoherence . in the past two decades </S>",
    "<S> , various photonic entanglement swapping experiments have been implemented  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a field test of entanglement swapping was demonstrated through free space link  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in most of the previous demonstrations of entanglement swapping , the same femtosecond laser was used in producing two entangled photon - pair sources  @xcite , making them impractical to be implemented in quantum network where the sources should be placed in distant nodes . </S>",
    "<S> pioneering works have been done to synchronize two sources which are pumped independently in laboratory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the difficulties in guaranteeing the indistinguishability of photons after they are transmitted through the realistic channel , a field test of entanglement swapping with independent entangled photon - pair sources remains an experimental challenge .    besides its applications in quantum repeater , the nonlocal correlation created by entanglement swapping can also be employed in quantum cryptography . </S>",
    "<S> although quantum key distribution ( qkd ) can in principle provide information - theoretical security based on quantum mechanics , practical qkd systems are suffering from side - channel attacks that explore the device flaws in real - life implementation . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the detector side - channel attacks have been removed by employing measurement - device - independent ( mdi ) qkd protocol  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , potential loopholes still exist on the source side . when the photon source is not well prepared according to the security proof model </S>",
    "<S> , attacks would be possible  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when entanglement swapping is used for qkd , each of alice and bob employs an entangled photon - pair source and sends one of the twin photons to an untrusted measurement site , eve . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the scenario of mdiqkd , the security of the final key does not rely on how faithful eve performs the bsm or announces the results . </S>",
    "<S> the mdi property stems from the beauty of teleportation , in which the measurement site does not reveal any information about the transmitted state in order to ensure the quantum transmission is faithful . furthermore , alice and bob measure the rest photon locally to obtain raw data which enjoys the source - independent property . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , an entangled source can be used as a basis - independent source  @xcite . from this point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the entanglement swapping setting for qkd enjoys both mdi and source - independent security properties .    in this letter , we present the realization of entanglement swapping with two independent telecommunication band entangled photon - pair sources placed at two nodes 12 km apart in hefei optical fibre network ( marked as alice and bob in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup](a ) ) . a third node , eve , in - between of alice and bob performs the bsm . </S>",
    "<S> the idler photons of entangled photon - pairs of alice and bob are detected locally and the signal photons are sent to eve over optical fibre with length of 14.7 km and 10.6 km , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> , e  @xmath1 ) and university of science and technology of china ( n  @xmath2 , e  @xmath3 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they prepare entangled photon - pairs , detect the idler photons ( i ) locally and send the signal photons ( s ) to eve , located in hefei software park ( n  @xmath4 @xmath5 , e  @xmath6 ) , to perform the bsm . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) and ( c ) experimental setups of time - bin entangled photon - pair source and bsm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum and classical channels are represented by yellow and purple lines , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the arbitrary function generator ( afg ) synchronized by the microwave generator generates 10 mhz clocks for the measurement devices , which is distributed to alice and bob through the same optical fibre with driving signals of sources using dwdm technique.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    both alice and bob generate time - bin entangled photon - pair through spontaneous four - wave - mixing ( sfwm ) in a 300 m dispersion shifted fibre ( dsf ) pumped by two consecutive laser pulses as shown in fig.[fig : setup](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two consecutive laser pulses are generated by carving a cw laser beam ( @xmath7 nm ) emitted by a distributed feedback laser ( dfb ) using an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) and then amplified by an erbium doped fibre amplifier ( edfa ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amplified spontaneous emission noise photons of edfa are suppressed by using cascaded dense wavelength division - multiplexing ( dwdm ) filters . because the phase matching condition of sfwm is eased owing to zero dispersion of dsf in telecommunication band , the down converted photon - pair has a broad bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the generated photon - pairs are accompanied by phonon - related single photons . </S>",
    "<S> another set of cascaded dwdm filters is used to single out photons with wavelength of @xmath8 ( idler ) and @xmath9 ( signal ) , as well as reject the other photons with extinction ratio of up to 115 db . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the dsf is immersed in liquid nitrogen for further reduction of phonon - related photons . </S>",
    "<S> since the time delay between the two consecutive laser pulses is 1 ns , much less than the coherence time of the cw laser , their relative phase is well - defined ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the down converted photon - pairs originated from the two laser pulses are in superposition state @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the state of photon - pair created by the first pulse and the second pulse of the two consecutive pulses , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> eve performs the bsm by interfering the signal photons at a 50:50 beam splitter ( bs ) and detecting them with two superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspd ) , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme can , in principle , discriminate two bell states , @xmath14 , out of the four bell states ( the other two bell states are defined by @xmath15 ) . here , we measure the time of detection events using a time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) with a resolution of 4 ps and only select the projections onto the singlet state @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the two corresponding idler photons are projected onto bell state @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> achieving two - photon interference with high and stable visibility in bsm is critical for entanglement swapping experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this demands to eliminate distinguishability of the two photons in every degree of freedom . in our experiment , the spatial and spectrum indistinguishablilities </S>",
    "<S> are guaranteed by using single mode fibre as spatial filter and identical fibre bragg gratings ( fbg ) as spectrum filters , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> however , the real challenge is to eliminate the distinguishability between independent photons in the time domain at interference . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal distinguishability arises from the sharp time correlation between the twin photons is suppressed by filtering the photons with fbgs with bandwidth of 4 ghz for both signal and idler photons . </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidth of fbgs is half of that of the pump pulse , meaning the single - photon - state purity is about @xmath18 . to synchronize the two sources </S>",
    "<S> , we use a microwave generator ( mg ) to provide the master clock for a pulse pattern generator ( ppg ) in the node of eve ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : setup](c ) ) , which drives an eom to carve a cw laser beam into 300 mhz laser pulse train with pulse width of about 75 ps . after passing through a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) with 1 ns path difference , </S>",
    "<S> each laser pulse is split into two consecutive laser pulses . then the laser pulse train is sent to alice and bob through optical fibre and detected by using 45 ghz photo - detectors ( pd ) to generate driving signals for the entangled photon - pair sources . </S>",
    "<S> compared to previous experiments to synchronize photon sources which were hard to maintain even in the laboratory  @xcite , in our field test , photons are interfered after being transmitted through optical fibres from alice to eve and from bob to eve which are separated by 6.4 km and 6.5 km in the field , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the surrounding temperature variance and vibration give rise to dramatical fluctuation in the effective length and polarization property of the optical fibre . </S>",
    "<S> we feed back the error signal derived from photon arrival time to the variable delay line ( vdl ) to control the creation of bob s entangled photon - pair source for every 200 s. the fluctuation of polarization is reduced using electronic controlled polarization controllers ( epc ) in a separate feedback loop . with these feedbacks , we largely suppress the distinguishability . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , automation is also applied to stabilize the phase of mzi , the power stability of pump power , the central wavelength of fbg , and to optimize the extinction ratio of eom .    to verify successful entanglement swapping </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the correlation curve of the two idler photons conditioned on the projection of the two signal photons onto bell state @xmath16 . in this stage , </S>",
    "<S> bob fixes the phase of his mzi and alice sweeps the phase of her mzi . </S>",
    "<S> the mzis used in our experiment are plannar lightwave circuit devices , and the phase can be tuned by controlling the device temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the detection signals are measured by using a tdc with 4 ps time resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we implement a four - fold coincidence measurement based on measurement results of alice , bob and eve , and the results are depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : intcur ] . </S>",
    "<S> the probabilities of four - fold coincidence count of photons show sinusoidal curves with fitted visibilities of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for measurement results when the phase of bob s mzi is set as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the average visibility of the fitted curves is @xmath0 , which corresponds to a fidelity of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value exceeds the classical limit of @xmath25 to demonstrate entanglement  @xcite and infers a violation of chsh bell inequality by more than two standard deviations , provided the swapped photons are in werner state  @xcite . in our experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the visibility of the correlation fringe is mainly degraded by multi - photon events . </S>",
    "<S> the average photon - pair number per pulse is about 0.03 for both entangled photon - pair sources , which upper - bounds the visibility of two - photon interference to be 0.91 in our experiment .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 for measured results with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . , </S>",
    "<S> scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the second stage of our experiment , we demonstrate qkd with swapped photons . actually , in our experiment the entanglment between the idler photons is generated a posteriori  @xcite . by measuring the idler photons in the time basis , @xmath28 and energy basis , @xmath29 , alice and bob </S>",

    "<S> the estimation of phase error rate is the key to the security analysis @xcite . due to the symmetry between the complementary bases , </S>",

    "<S> the total number of sifted key is 5096 bits . </S>",
    "<S> the error rate in energy basis is consistent with the average visibility of correlation fringe according to the relation @xmath37 . due to the slightly difference between the error rates of sifted key in the two bases , </S>",
