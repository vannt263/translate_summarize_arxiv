    "ring structures are common features in different astrophysical objects on different scales . in particular , we have ring structures in the giant planets of the solar system and also in several ring galaxies ( or r galaxies ) which are objects with approximate elliptical rings and no luminous matter visible in their interiors.@xcite furthermore , sometimes , as the result of interactions between galaxies , a ring of gas and stars is formed and rotates over the poles of a galaxy , resulting in the polar - ring galaxies.@xcite in newtonian gravity , the potential of a ring enclosing a disc can be obtained by a process of complexification of the potential of a punctual mass.@xcite this potential was used to build a family of similar structures.@xcite also , the lord kelvin inversion theorem@xcite can be used to invert a member of the morgan & morgan family of discs@xcite to produce an infinite disc with a central hole of the same radius as the original disc .",
    "we can define a cut - off in these inverted disc to represent flat rings .",
    "furthermore , letelier constructed several families of flat rings using the superposition of morgan and morgan discs of different densities.@xcite recently , vogt & letelier@xcite found potential - density pairs representing flat ring structures by superposing members of the classical kuzmin - toomre family of discs.@xcite by using a suitable transformation , they found that these flat ring systems can be used to generate three dimensional potential - density pairs with toroidal mass distribution .",
    "the main advantage of these toroidal mass distribution models is that the density and the gravitational potential are given in terms of elementary functions .",
    "also , similar toroidal analytical systems have been obtained using a different technique , known as the complex - shift method.@xcite in general relativity , the properties of space - times that represent superpositions of a schwarzschild black hole and a disc or ring were investigated by several authors.@xcite the purpose of this article is to consider three - dimensional models for the gravitational field of rings and disc with rings in the context of general relativity following the method used in ref . .",
    "as a very first test for stability , we study the stability of particles in circular orbits using the relativistic version@xcite of the rayleigh criterion of stability.@xcite we know that a better approach to study its stability is by performing first order perturbations of the energy - momentum tensor that take into account the collective behavior of the particles.@xcite this study will be done in a future work .    the article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present a special form of the isotropic schwarzschild metric and the components of the energy - momentum tensor as functions of the metric coefficients , from which the physical properties of the matter distribution can be calculated .",
    "we also write expressions for the tangential circular velocity and specific angular momentum of test particles in circular motion . in section 3 , we apply the results of section 2 to a single ring system , a disc with a ring system and a double ring system , which are particular cases of a family of solution found in ref . .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we summarize our results .",
    "in general relativity are two methods to find exact solutions of einsten s field equations . the first method is the so called direct method , in which we set the energy - momentum tensor and then we find the metric tensor . in the other hand , most of the models ( for example , disks and rings in astrophysics ) were found by using the inverse method , in which we use the metric to calculate its energy - momentum tensor . in this article",
    "we used the second .",
    "but , not every solution found using this method is physical acceptable .",
    "the models must satisfy the energy criteria and also is desirable to have a clear physical interpretation at the newtonian limit .",
    "so , the justification of the method is done a posteriori and it will depend of the outcome . with this in consideration , let us consider the particular case of axially symmetric spacetimes in isotropic coordinates @xmath0    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the usual cylindrical coordinates and @xmath4 . from einstein equations , @xmath5 , and the metric ( [ metric ] ) we obtain the following expressions for the components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath6 , \\label{tphiphi } \\\\",

    ", we interpret the exterior schwarzschild solution as the space - time solution of a spherical symmetric mass body because in its newtonian limit we obtain the gravitational potential of a point mass .",
    "if the solution does not have a consistent newtonian limit then it is , in some sense , useless .",

    "in a recent work , vogt & letelier@xcite presented families of flat rings that were constructed by superposing members of the kuzmin - toomre family of discs .",
    "in particular they found a family for single flat rings , double flat rings and discs with flat rings .",
    "one way to generate three - dimensional potential - density from flat ring models is to inflate the rings performing the transformation @xmath31 .",
    "this is the same transformation used by miyamoto & nagai@xcite to inflate the kuzmin - toomre discs . in the next subsections we construct general relativistic thick models of rings based on these flat rings families .",
