    "the behavior of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of temperature and/or density has important consequences in nuclear and particle physics as well as in astrophysics and cosmology . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "even if a significant progress has been made on the development of ab initio calculations as lattice qcd  @xcite , these are not yet able to provide a detailed knowledge of the full qcd phase diagram , and most theoretical approaches rely in the study of low energy effective models .",
    "qualitatively we expect that chiral symmetry , which is broken at very low temperatures and densities , will be restored as the temperature and/or density are increased . however , the precise characteristics of this phase transition are still not known . for",
    "two massless flavors most effective approaches to qcd suggest the existence of a tricritical point on the @xmath7 plane , which separates a first order phase transition line found at lower @xmath8 and larger @xmath9 , and a second order transition line where the chiral restoration occurs for higher @xmath8 and lower @xmath9 .",
    "for two light flavors a similar behavior is expected , although the second order transition line is replaced by a more or less sharp crossover and , correspondingly , the tricritical point becomes an end point . in any case , for a given effective model that can provide a reasonable successful description of low energy strong interactions , it is very important to obtain as much information as possible about the characteristics of the chiral restoration transition . in previous works  @xcite",
    "we have begun the study of chiral restoration in the context of chiral quark models with nonlocal interactions  @xcite , which can be considered as some nonlocal extension of the widely studied nambu@xmath3jona - lasinio model  @xcite .",
    "in fact , nonlocality arises naturally in the context of several successful approaches to low - energy quark dynamics as , for example , the instanton liquid model  @xcite and the schwinger - dyson resummation techniques  @xcite .",
    "it has been also argued that nonlocal covariant extensions of the njl model have several advantages over the local scheme like e.g.  a natural regularization scheme which automatically preserves the anomalies  @xcite , small nlo corrections  @xcite , etc .",
    "in addition , it has been argued  @xcite that a proper choice of the nonlocal regulator and the model parameters can lead to some form of quark confinement , in the sense that the effective quark propagator has no poles at real energies .",
    "several studies  @xcite have shown that these nonlocal chiral quark models provide a satisfactory description of the hadron properties at zero temperature and density .",
    "the aim of the present work is to complement the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , presenting further details about the chiral phase transition within these schemes .",
    "indeed , we show that in the chiral limit it is possible to develop a semi - analytic framework which allows us to explicitly determine the phase transition curve , the position of the critical points , some relevant critical exponents , etc . for the case of finite current quark masses , we present the behavior of various thermodynamical and chiral response functions across the phase transition . in particular , it is found that thermal and chiral susceptibilities show clear peaks which allow to define a phase transition temperature as it is usually done in lattice calculations .",
