    "the voter model @xcite is arguably the simplest nonequilibrium ordering process .",
    "its dynamics are perhaps most easily described within its original formulation as a model for population dynamics @xcite .",
    "each site of a lattice ( or network ) is occupied by an individual belonging to one of a number of species . in each timestep , a site is chosen at random , and the individual at that site is replaced by an offspring ( copy ) of an individual selected at random from a neighbouring site . in a finite system , one of the possible absorbing states  in which only a single species remains  is eventually reached . from a physical perspective , the interest in this process is that order is arrived at purely through fluctuations , rather than driven by surface tension as in the ising model ( see e.g. , @xcite ; also @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "many variants of the basic voter model have been investigated , some quite recently : examples include those where multiple individuals occupy a site @xcite , where the site chosen in each timestep contains the individual that is copied rather than replaced @xcite , or where different sites have different probabilities of being chosen for update @xcite .",
    "specific instances drawn from this wider class of _ random - copying _ models have applications in population genetics , ecology and cultural evolution , as reviewed in @xcite . despite their simplicity , these models reproduce observed patterns of species diversity in ecosystems @xcite and of the cultural dynamics of features like baby names @xcite .",
    "they also play an important role as _ null models _ of evolution in the absence of selection @xcite .    a stochastic equation of motion for the frequency @xmath0 of a chosen species is straightforwardly obtained in the mean - field limit ( i.e. , when the system lacks spatial structure ) .",
    "more precisely , when each site is visited for update at a uniform rate @xmath1 , and the individual landing on the target site is sampled uniformly from the entire population , the probability distribution of @xmath0 is  for sufficiently large systems  governed by @xmath2 derivations of this equation can be found in many places , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these stochastic dynamics have three key properties .",
    "first , there is no deterministic ( drift ) term in the above equation , confirming that order is attained through fluctuations alone .",
    "second , all timescales of the ordering process are proportional to the parameter @xmath3 : in the mean field , this parameter is simply equal to the number of sites , @xmath4 .",
    "finally , the full , time - dependent solution for @xmath5 from arbitrary initial condition is known @xcite .",
    "then , for example , the probability that complete order has been attained by time @xmath6 is given by the combination @xmath7 .",
    "many recent works have switched focus to models defined on nontrivial network structures , notably _ heterogeneous _ networks in which the degree can vary widely between nodes @xcite .",
    "such networks are particularly relevant to cultural applications , where the interaction frequency between agents need not be purely a function of spatial proximity .",
    "remarkably , it has been found that even in the presence of significant heterogeneity , the ordering dynamics is well - described by the mean - field equation ( [ demf ] ) .",
    "for example , the mean time to reach complete order as predicted by ( [ demf ] ) has been found to apply in models with complex spatial structure @xcite .",
    "the only differences are : ( i ) that @xmath0 is a weighted average of a species frequency over the network ; and ( ii ) the _ effective size _ , @xmath3 , need not equal the actual network size @xmath4 ( or even scale linearly with it ) .",
    "thus , a good understanding of ordering behaviour within random - copying models on networks can be gained if one can identify when a reduction to ( [ demf ] ) is possible , and if so , what the value of @xmath3 is .",
    "for example , the entire distribution of ordering times can be read off from the exact solution of ( [ demf ] ) .    in this work",
    "we will demonstrate that the mean - field diffusion equation ( [ demf ] ) is in fact _ exact _ for general random - copying processes on arbitrary networks at all but the very earliest times when there is a separation of emergent timescales within a two - particle coalescence reaction dynamics that is _ dual _ to the random - copying process @xcite . in several earlier works @xcite , the equation ( [ demf ] )",
    "was typically obtained by making specific assumptions and approximations , and the fundamental physical reason why the simple diffusion ( [ demf ] ) should apply was not clearly identified .",
    "the central object in our analysis is the _ quasi - stationary _ distribution of a pair of particles that have survived for a long time without reacting .",
    "this state decays at some characteristic rate , and if its lifetime greatly exceeds the relaxation time to the quasi - stationary state from a given initial condition , the model exhibits the separation of timescales that is required for the validity of ( [ demf ] ) .",
    "the effective size @xmath3 is then proportional to the single , dominant timescale in the reaction dynamics , that is , the lifetime of the quasi - stationary state .",
    "this paper is divided into two parts . in the first part ( sections  [ modsec][redsec ] ) we define the general class of random - copying models that includes well - studied instances , like the voter model , as special cases , and derive our main results",
    "these are : eq .  ( [ demf ] ) , the condition for its validity and the expression for the fundamental parameter @xmath3 .",
    "as we will need to switch repeatedly between the forward - time formulation of the dynamics in terms of a diffusion equation and an equivalent backward - time particle reaction process whose details are not widely discussed in the physics literature , we must unfortunately contend with lengthy , but necessary , preliminaries in sections  [ modsec][coalsec ] .",
    "once this is done , the derivations of our main results follow in section  [ redsec ] .",
    "we emphasise that the validity of eq .",
    "( [ demf ] ) can be determined by considering only a single pair of coalescing random walkers on the network . in principle , ascertaining whether the system is completely ordered requires knowledge of the state of all @xmath4 sites simultaneously : hence being able to determine whether the considerably simpler single - coordinate diffusion applies without having to solve the full dynamics is of great practical benefit .    in the second part of this paper",
    ", we go beyond purely formal statements about random - copying dynamics and focus on strategies to estimate the emergent timescales of the two - particle reaction process .",
    "these methods are developed in section  [ trssec ] and used to demonstrate the validity of the diffusion ( [ demf ] ) for specific combinations of network structures and copying dynamics in section  [ appsec ] .",
    "although these methods are restricted to random - copying processes that map onto time - reversal symmetric random walks , it turns out that the most widely - studied variations on voter - model dynamics @xcite fall into this category . on the other hand",
    ", we do not ( in contrast to some existing treatments @xcite ) invoke a coarse - graining over multiple sites of the network to obtain a diffusion equation .",
    "thus , we can use our analytical methods to investigate the effects of degree correlations on the effective size @xmath3 that appears in equation ( [ demf ] ) , which until now has been accessible only by computer simulation .",
    "we remark that the idea that random - copying dynamics in the presence of spatial structure may be adequately represented by a mean - field model with some effective size @xmath3 has a very long history in population genetics , dating back to the work of wright from the 1930s @xcite .",
    "furthermore , various separation of timescales arguments have been employed as a means to identify an effective size @xcite . in this work ,",
    "our main contribution to this line of enquiry is to highlight the two particular emergent timescales that are relevant in determining the applicability ( or otherwise ) of a single effective size : their importance does not appear to have been fully recognised before .",
    "we furthermore show that this separation exists even in cases where it has been argued that there will be more than one relevant timescale in the dynamics , and that a description in terms of a single effective size will not apply @xcite .",
    "we discuss these points in much more detail in the conclusion , section  [ consec ] , along with a number of remaining open questions .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath4 nodes ( or sites ) labelled by the integers @xmath8 .",
    "site @xmath9 hosts a population of @xmath10 individuals , each of which is a member of one of a number of species .",
    "the dynamics is specified in terms of a set of copying rates @xmath11 .",
    "each corresponds to an independent poisson process : at rate @xmath11 one of the @xmath10 individuals on site @xmath12 is copied , and the offspring individual replaces a randomly - chosen individual on site @xmath9 .",
    "see figure  [ randomcopy ] .",
    "note that the case @xmath13 is legitimate , and indeed the rates @xmath14 will typically be nonzero in any particular instance of this model .",
    "we could also consider models where @xmath10 varies from site to site within the framework presented below : however , this serves only to complicate certain definitions and expressions so we shall restrict the discussion to a spatially - uniform @xmath10 .",
    "random - copying dynamics on a network .",
    "here , each site hosts @xmath15 individuals and there are four species in total .",
    "the individual with dotted outline on site @xmath9 has been selected for replacement by copying an individual on site @xmath12 .",
    "this event takes place as a poisson process with rate @xmath11 . ]",
    "the rates @xmath11 determine the model s network structure .",
    "elements of the _ adjacency matrix _ @xmath16 , which indicate if sites @xmath9 and @xmath12 are neighbours , are zero if @xmath17 , and unity otherwise ( except the diagonal elements @xmath18 which are always taken to be zero ) .",
    "the _ degree _ @xmath19 of node @xmath9 can then be defined as @xmath20 although we no not require the adjacency matrix to be symmetric in the first part of this paper , we will for simplicity assume this is the case .",
    "( for example , we do not then have to distinguish between in - degree and out - degree ) .",
    "note , however , that the symmetry @xmath21 does _ not _ imply that @xmath22 .    in a finite system",
    ", there is some probability that a species eventually goes extinct  this occurs if all its representatives have been replaced by individuals of other species . over time , the number of species decreases until only a single one remains .",
    "this stationary absorbing state of complete order is referred to variously as _ consensus _ or _ fixation _ ( in the sociodynamics and genetics literature respectively ) .",
    "the original voter model dynamics specifies that , in each timestep , a site is first chosen at random , and then a copy taken from one of its neighbours .",
    "this constrains the copying rates @xmath11 to have the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the rate at which a site is chosen for update .",
    "this is , however , only one of a vast range of possible ways to construct a set of copying rates .",
    "also discussed in the literature is the _ invasion process _ , whereby the parent site @xmath12 is chosen uniformly at random in each timestep , and the offspring ` invades ' a randomly chosen neighbour ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to the choice @xmath25 another possibility is _ link dynamics _",
    "@xcite , in which an edge between two nodes is chosen at random , and the copy made in one of the two possible directions along that edge .",
    "one way to specify this process is through the rates @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mean degree within the network . in networks where all nodes have the same degree , @xmath28 for all @xmath29 , and these three choices are all equivalent . on heterogeneous networks",
    ", these different rules have been found to lead to different scalings of the effective size @xmath3 with the actual network size @xmath4 . for concreteness",
    ", we will mostly consider the above copying schemes .",
    "however , we stress that many of our results are quite general , and are not restricted to these specific choices .      in the original formulation of the voter model",
    ", there is one individual per site : @xmath30 .",
    "then , the frequency of a given species on a site can take only one of two values : @xmath31 or @xmath32 . to obtain a diffusion equation for the copying dynamics without the need to average over multiple sites ( for example , all sites of the same degree , as has been done elsewhere @xcite )",
    ", we will take the limit @xmath33 , so that the frequency @xmath34 of a chosen species on a site becomes a continuous variable in the range @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "we will use the terminology _ discrete - frequency _ and _ continuous - frequency _ models to refer to the extreme cases @xmath30 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ obvious that results obtained for continuous - frequency models will apply to their discrete - frequency counterparts .",
    "however , it turns out that for any fixed , finite @xmath10 , discrete - frequency dynamics are recovered in a limit where the copying rates between sites , @xmath11 where @xmath36 , vanish",
    ". this fact can be deduced from a convergence theorem for markov chains due to mhle @xcite . the basic physical idea behind this result",
    "is that in the time it takes for an individual to arrive from a neighbouring site , sufficiently many replacements have been made by sampling from the local population of @xmath10 individuals that each site is in one of its locally absorbing states  that is , each site hosts only a single species . as a consequence ,",
    "the frequency of each species on any chosen site is always close to @xmath31 or @xmath32 ( although globally it may be somewhere in between ) and thus the discrete - frequency dynamics is recovered .",
    "the way in which the @xmath30 discrete - frequency dynamics is obtained mathematically is summarised in [ conv ] .",
    "we illustrate here with the concrete examples of the previous subsection .",
    "discrete - frequency versions of voter , invasion or link dynamics can be obtained by taking the parameter @xmath24 that appears in ( [ muv])([mul ] ) to zero , whilst holding all @xmath14 at fixed , finite ( but otherwise arbitrary ) values . to recover the @xmath30 version of the voter , invasion or link dynamics , with the unit of time defined such that each site is visited on average once per timestep",
    ", one must multiply all times by @xmath37 ( see [ conv ] ) .",
    "a key point is that for any finite @xmath10 , no matter how large , the discrete - frequency dynamics are recovered for sufficiently small @xmath24 .",
    "that is , any difference between a set of frequencies @xmath38 in the @xmath39 model and their values in corresponding realisations of the @xmath30 model can be made arbitrarily small by reducing @xmath24 . in the next section , and the remainder of this work , we will be working in the @xmath33 limit , such that all frequencies @xmath34 can be regarded as continuous variables .",
    "we will assume that results for discrete frequency models can then be obtained by subsequently taking @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , we assume that the limits @xmath33 and @xmath40 commute",
    ". we do not know _ a priori _ that this assumption is valid . in practice",
    ", we find that we recover known results for the voter model , or good agreement with simulation , when we perform this procedure ( see section  [ appsec ] ) .",
    "we now derive the fokker - planck equation for probability distribution over the @xmath4-dimensional space of local frequencies @xmath34 of a chosen species . although the method used to derive this equation , based on _ jump moments _ ,",
    "is standard @xcite , we will recapitulate it here as it central to the derivation eq .",
    "( [ demf ] ) that follows in section  [ redsec ] below .",
    "the key point is that the fokker - planck equation has the expansion @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the time variable and the jump moments are defined as @xmath43 \\cdots [ x_{i_n}(\\tau+\\delta \\tau ) - x_{i_n}(\\tau ) ] \\rangle}{\\delta \\tau } \\;.\\ ] ] in calculating the jump moments , the initial coordinates @xmath44 are assumed known and fixed , and the angle brackets denote an average over all possible realisations of the dynamics in the time interval @xmath45 $ ] . these averages can be computed from the underlying stochastic dynamical rules .    within the present class of random - copying models ,",
    "a local frequency @xmath34 may increase or decrease by an amount @xmath46 in any single update .",
    "the continuous - time transition rates for these processes are @xmath47 in the time interval @xmath48 $ ] , only events involving a single change to one of the @xmath34 contributes to order @xmath49 in the average in ( [ jm ] ) , for any value of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , for the first jump moment we have , @xmath51 and for the second moments @xmath52\\ ] ] while @xmath53 for @xmath54 , since two different @xmath34 never change at the same time .",
    "if all @xmath11 remain fixed as @xmath33 , the second jump moments vanish relative to the first .",
    "the resulting fokker - planck equation then has only a drift ( deterministic ) term , and no diffusive component .",
    "both terms are contribute in this limit if one takes @xmath11 to vanish as @xmath55 for all @xmath56 , as is standard in population genetics @xcite .",
    "we thus define rescaled rates @xmath57 and @xmath58 through @xmath59 \\displaystyle \\frac{c_i}{2 } & i = j \\end{array } \\right . \\;.\\ ] ] by introducing a rescaled time @xmath60 we find as @xmath33 the fokker - planck equation @xmath61 the third and higher jump moments are all of order @xmath62 and higher , and thus do not contribute in the @xmath33 limit .",
    "although this fokker - planck equation is strictly valid in this limit , it is understood that it serves as an excellent approximation for large but finite @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "our experience suggests that @xmath63 yields results consistent with infinite @xmath10 ( see section  [ bipsec ] for a comparison between finite @xmath10 simulations and the infinite-@xmath10 theory ) .    in principle , to study the ordering dynamics of random - copying processes one would need to solve the full time - dependence of this @xmath4-dimensional diffusion .",
    "it is therefore apparent that the reduction to the single coordinate diffusion ( [ demf ] ) , when it is possible , represents a dramatic reduction in the complexity of the problem .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the copying process defined in section  [ modsec ] has an equivalent formulation as a particle reaction dynamics ( see e.g. @xcite for mathematical formulations and @xcite for a more detailed account from a statistical physics perspective than the brief outline we give here ) .",
    "this process is identified by looking backward in time at the history of an individual in the current configuration . at some point in the past , this individual was created by the copying process .",
    "the rate at which an individual currently on site @xmath9 was created by copying an individual on site @xmath12 is @xmath64 , where the factor @xmath10 appears because @xmath11 is the total rate at which one of the @xmath10 individuals on site @xmath9 is replaced by an offspring arriving from site @xmath12 .",
    "this individual we call the _ ancestor _ of that in the current configuration .",
    "as we look further back in time , the ancestor performs a random walk , hopping from site @xmath9 to site @xmath12 at rate @xmath11 .",
    "see figure  [ randomwalk ] .",
    "we will also refer to these ancestors as _",
    "particles_.     backward - time formulation of the random - copying dynamics as a random walk process . shown is the configuration of the system of figure  [ randomcopy ] after the copying event has occurred .",
    "looking backward in time , the tagged individual on site @xmath9 , shown with a solid fill , has a probability @xmath11 per unit time of having been copied from site @xmath12 .",
    "the tagged individual thus hops to site @xmath12 at rate @xmath11 . ]",
    "one can also consider the ancestry of multiple individuals .",
    "these independently perform random walks , as just described .",
    "however there is also the possibility that at some point in the history , one ancestor is the direct offspring of one of the others .",
    "the rate at which one of a pair of ancestors occupying sites @xmath9 and @xmath12 was copied from the other is @xmath65 .",
    "this time , the factor @xmath66 appears because both parent and offspring have a probability of @xmath55 of being involved in the copying process .",
    "after this copying event , the two lines of ancestry merge : one individual is the common ancestor of the original pair .",
    "this interaction can be viewed as a particle coalescence reaction .    to convert these rates into the system of rescaled time units defined in the previous section , we multiply them by @xmath66 .",
    "we then find that an ancestor hops from site @xmath9 to @xmath12 at rate @xmath57 , and a pair of particles on site @xmath9 react at rate @xmath58 .",
    "the rate for particles on different sites @xmath36 to react vanishes under this rescaling .    within this backward - time picture ,",
    "it is important to realise that if one starts with an arbitrary pair of individuals in a finite system and looks far enough back in time the ancestor of one individual will at some point be the direct descendant of the other .",
    "that is , any two particles eventually react , leading to an overall reduction in the number of particles over time ( i.e. , fewer ancestors who contribute descendants to the present - day population ) .",
    "the steady state of the particle reaction process thus comprises a single common ancestor of any set of individuals chosen from the present - time population .",
    "if there is a single ancestor common to the _ whole _ population , then it follows that all individuals at the present time are of the same species  i.e .",
    ", that complete order has been reached at the present time .",
    "thus the stationary absorbing state of full order in the forward - time dynamics corresponds directly to the stationary state of a single particle in the backward - time picture .    in the remainder of this work",
    "we need only to consider the backward - time dynamics starting from a single pair of particles .",
    "two key properties of this reaction - diffusion process are the probability distributions @xmath67 that a single particle on site @xmath9 at time @xmath68 occupies site @xmath69 at time @xmath6 and @xmath70 that a pair of particles occupy sites @xmath69 and @xmath71 .",
    "note that in the reaction dynamics , we take increasing time to mean further back into the past , with @xmath68 indicating the present time . when talking about a particle pair , we will consider the particles to be distinguishable , so that the configuration @xmath72 is not the same as @xmath73 if @xmath74 .",
    "these conventions make writing down the master equations for these probability distributions slightly more straightforward .",
    "the master equation governing the single - particle distribution function is @xmath75   \\equiv - \\sum_i q_i(t ) { \\ensuremath{m^{(1)}}}_{ik } \\;.\\ ] ] here we have introduced the matrix @xmath76 where the sign of the entries has been chosen so that the eigenvalues of @xmath77 all have nonnegative real parts . assuming that the network is such that the stationary distribution @xmath78 is unique , we have at late times @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the eigenvalue of @xmath77 with the smallest , nonzero real part .",
    "meanwhile , the joint probability distribution for a pair of unreacted particles is governed by the master equation @xmath81 the first two terms in this equation give the contributions to this probability from particles hopping into , or out of , sites @xmath69 and @xmath71 .",
    "the final term arises from the decrease in the probability that the two particles have not yet reacted due to the coalescence reaction .",
    "we can write this equation more compactly as @xmath82 where the matrix @xmath83 is @xmath84 here we use @xmath85 as a shorthand for @xmath86 , i.e. , the object that is zero unless all four indices are the same , in which is it equals unity .    on a finite network where the stationary distribution for a single particle is unique",
    ", the two particles will eventually react",
    ". therefore @xmath70 vanishes as @xmath87 .",
    "the matrix @xmath88 has eigenvalues whose real parts are all positive .",
    "the smallest eigenvalue @xmath89 is strictly positive , and is equal to the asymptotic rate at which a pair of unreacted particles coalesce .",
    "the associated eigenvector we will denote @xmath90 and normalise so that @xmath91 .",
    "this is the _ quasi - stationary distribution _ of the two - particle system .",
    "that is , if we condition on the two particles never having reacted , the probability they are found on sites @xmath69 and @xmath71 approach the stationary value @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the rate of relaxation to the quasi - stationary state is given by the real part of the second - smallest eigenvalue @xmath92 .",
    "that is , at late times @xmath93 as stated in the introduction , and to be demonstrated below , it is a separation of timescales between the relaxation to and decay of the quasi - stationary state , controlled by @xmath92 and @xmath89 respectively , that allows for the reduction of the full fokker - planck equation ( [ fpe ] ) to the single - coordinate diffusion of eq .",
    "( [ demf ] ) .",
    "now that the forward- and backward - time formulations of the model defined in section  [ modsec ] have been set up , we may derive the single - coordinate diffusion ( [ demf ] ) and establish the condition for its validity .",
    "this amounts to identifying the quantity @xmath0 whose ensemble - average is conserved by the dynamics , and calculating its second jump moment .",
    "the procedure is not hard , but it does involve several manipulations that require explanation .    the key quantity @xmath0 has been identified a number of times before ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the overall normalisation of the vector is unimportant , since this cancels in the numerator and denominator of ( [ var ] ) .",

    "our aim in this final section is to demonstrate that degree anti - correlations lead to a further increase in @xmath3 beyond what is predicted by ( [ default ] ) .    as template networks we use molloy - reed networks @xcite with an approximate power - law degree distribution .",

    "we used two degree distributions , one with @xmath258 , and one with @xmath259 . in both cases the minimum degree of any node was @xmath260 .",

    "since ( [ ranid ] ) was obtained by assuming an absence of correlations between particles occupying different sites in the quasi - stationary two - particle state , it would appear that ( at least at the network sizes simulated ) such correlations exist , despite the fact that degrees of neighbouring nodes are designed to be weakly correlated in molloy - reed networks .",
    "we also see that the deviations from ( [ ranid ] ) increase dramatically when anti - correlations are introduced by the explosion procedure discussed above .",
    "although we have not been able to demonstrate analytically that there is a separation of timescales in the dynamics on these networks , numerical data ( not shown ) suggest that the transient is irrelevant except possibly on the uncorrelated template network with @xmath258 .    to understand more quantitatively the decrease of @xmath126 ( and hence increase of @xmath3 ) under the explosion operation , we employ a refinement of the ansatz used to obtain ( [ ranid ] ) that allows for correlations between unreacted particles on neighbouring sites in the quasi - stationary state .",
    "details are presented in the appendix .",
    "the bound on @xmath126 that is ultimately obtained in the @xmath243 limit is , for large @xmath4 , @xmath263 where @xmath264 here , @xmath265 is a measure of how much high - degree nodes tend to be connected to other high - degree nodes : it is related to the _ assortativity coefficient _ of a network @xcite .",

    "however , the deviation from the baseline ( [ ranid ] ) will typically be large when degrees of neighbouring nodes are anticorrelated and/or triangles tend to be formed by high - degree nodes .",

    ", one finds asymptotically that @xmath268 and @xmath205 converge . on the other hand ,",
    "the bounds are distinct after the explosion operation .",
    "suppose the template network has given values of @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",

    "this implies that for the exploded network we have @xmath272 and @xmath273 ( where we use a prime to indicate the exploded network ) . to compute the statistic @xmath274",
    ", we note that in the exploded graph , each original node @xmath9 is connected to @xmath19 nodes of degree two . taking into account that the sum over all neighbouring pairs @xmath29 can be written as twice the sum over all edges , and that each edge is connected to one of the original template nodes , we find that @xmath275 by design , the exploded network contains no triangles , so @xmath276 . using these values in ( [ ranimp ] ) we find , again in the @xmath243 limit , @xmath277 which we can contrast with the baseline @xmath278 .",
    "relative to this baseline we see that the asymptotic decay rate of the quasi - stationary state is reduced by a factor of at least @xmath279 as a consequence of the degree anti - correlations in the exploded networks .    in figure  [ ranvotibofn ]",
    "the same data as in figure  [ ranvotbofn ] are shown , but this time relative to the improved bound ( [ ranimp ] ) .",
    "we see that in all cases , the improved bound is closer to the measured asymptotic decay rate , although significant discrepancies remain .",
    "the reason for this is that the ansatz for the quasi - stationary eigenvector @xmath163 does not contain sufficient structure to capture all the relevant correlations between a pair of unreacted particles .",
    "however , the fact that the correction factors shown in figures  [ ranvotibofn ] and [ ranvotbofn ] are only weakly dependent on system size @xmath4 suggests that the correct _ scaling _ of the quasi - stationary reaction rate with @xmath4 is captured by the expressions ( [ ranid ] ) and ( [ ranimp ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with previous works in which the scaling of @xmath3 with @xmath4 has been established through fairly simple approximation schemes @xcite , further work having been necessary to improve on the prefactors @xcite .",

    "in this work , we have shown that the onset of order within a large class of random copying processes ( including the voter model ) on spatially - structured networks can be described exactly in terms of the diffusion of a single collective coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity is a weighted average of a species frequency over nodes of the network .",
    "when the reduction onto the single - coordinate diffusion process is possible , the only significant effect of the spatial structure relative to the exactly - solvable ` mean - field ' diffusion of equation  ( [ demf ] ) is to replace the actual network size @xmath4 with an effective size @xmath3 .",
    "as we have shown in section  [ redsec ] , a remarkable feature of the analysis is that in order to establish the validity of the single - coordinate diffusion ( [ demf ] ) , one _ only _ needs to establish two properties of a two - particle reaction - diffusion process .",
    "the first is the lifetime of the quasi - stationary probability distribution for two unreacted particles .",
    "the second is a separation of timescales between this quasi - stationary lifetime and that of the relaxation to quasi - stationarity . in principle , to establish the probability that complete order has set in by a time @xmath6 , one would need to compute an @xmath4-point correlation function , starting , for example , with the full @xmath4-dimensional diffusion equation ( [ fpe ] ) .",
    "the fact that one can show that the one - dimensional diffusion ( [ demf ] ) is valid by appealing only to a two - particle problem represents a considerable simplification in the analysis of voter and other random - copying models .",
    "in section  [ appsec ] we demonstrated the separation of timescales within certain exactly - solvable models , namely , wright s island model and on the bipartite graph .",
    "although this property has previously been assumed with varying degrees of explicitness within these models @xcite , we are not aware of this property actually being confirmed for these models before . furthermore , many existing treatments of random - copying dynamics on heterogeneous networks @xcite have derived a diffusion approximation by aggregating multiple sites in order to construct continuous spatial variables . such approaches",
    "have the drawback that the network structure gets ` washed out ' in the coarse - graining .",
    "here we have described an alternative approach whereby a continuous variable is associated with each site , and the network structure is retained . as we have shown in section  [ appsec ] , anti - correlations between the degree of neighbouring nodes leads in the example of the invasion process on a bipartite network to a scaling of the effective size @xmath3 with network size @xmath4 that differs from that predicted by an approach that neglects these correlations @xcite . for voter dynamics on random networks ,",
    "the effect of degree correlations appears to be less severe , affecting the prefactor rather than the scaling exponent . since the inverse participation ratio @xmath202 seems to be the quantity that dominates the scaling of @xmath3 with @xmath4 in these models , the physical origin of the sublinear scaling of @xmath3 with @xmath4 that can be observed @xcite lies in the localisation of the quasi - stationary single - particle distribution @xmath95 in the vicinity of high - degree nodes .    in existing treatments of random - copying dynamics on heterogeneous networks ,",
    "the methods used to arrive at the diffusion equation ( [ demf ] ) have to some extent been _ ad - hoc_. here we have formulated a more systematic treatment based on timescales of the two - particle reaction - diffusion dynamics .",
    "the remaining task is to find good methods to estimate these timescales  and thereby demonstrate their separation . in cases where the single - particle reaction dynamics is time - reversal symmetric , we have shown that one can use the single - particle relaxation rate as a proxy for the corresponding quantity in the two - particle sector ; we have also demonstrated the utility of a variational approach to bound the effective size @xmath3 from below . while this has allowed the separation of timescales to be demonstrated within very simple models , it was still necessary to resort to simulations to establish whether it was present on random network structures .",
    "development of these methods  perhaps using bounds on the single - particle relaxation dynamics that have been derived elsewhere @xcite  would be needed to determine the class of networks and dynamical processes for which ( [ demf ] ) is valid .",
    "we remark that ( [ demf ] ) is known to apply to the voter model on square lattices in two dimensions and above @xcite . in two dimensions , it is found that the effective population size grows logarithmically with system size ( relative to the rate at which a particle relaxes to the stationary uniform distribution ) .",
    "this can be understood as a statement that domains coarsen logarithmically in the two - dimensional voter model @xcite .",
    "although the separation of timescales is weak in this case , it is nonetheless present",
    ". thus one would expect the separation of timescales to be observed on random networks with small diameters , on the grounds that a single particle would be expected to explore the system on a faster timescale than would be possible on a two - dimensional square lattice of the same size",
    ". it would be interesting to pursue this line of enquiry further .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the use of a single effective size @xmath3 to characterise purely stochastic population dynamics in subdivided populations is widespread in population genetics ( see e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a fair amount of discussion has centred around the fact that different definitions of @xmath3 are possible , depending on which property of the stochastic dynamics is measured and calibrated against an unstructured ( mean - field ) population @xcite . whilst it is widely understood that asymptotically many definitions converge onto the lifetime of the quasi - stationary state ( also known as the _ eigenvalue effective size _",
    "@xcite ) , the importance of a separation of timescales between this lifetime and others seems to be less well established .",
    "for example , sjdin _ et al _ @xcite , identify the asymptotic rate of particle coalescence as defining ` the ' effective population size . in these analyses , they examine a separation of timescales in the _ definition _ of migration and coalescence rates , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "that is , migration rates that vanish with local population size @xmath10 with differing exponents .",
    "this approach potentially misses the possibility  demonstrated here in the examples of section  [ appsec]that one can have a separation of _ emergent _ timescales that is sufficient to allow a single effective size that characterises almost the entire history of the dynamics .",
    "the importance of emergent timescales has perhaps been most clearly recognised by wakeley and co - workers @xcite . in particular , the rapid relaxation of the single - particle dynamics as a condition for a single , well - defined effective size was noted in @xcite .",
    "however , that study was restricted to a rather special class of _ vertex - transitive _ networks and dynamical update rules .",
    "furthermore , the irrelevance of _ all _ timescales other than the relaxation of the quasi - stationary state was implicitly assumed rather than explicitly demonstrated .",
    "we believe that the present analysis offers considerable additional insight into the applicability of a one - dimensional diffusion characterised by a single effective population size for a general class of random - copying dynamics on complex networks .    nevertheless , a number of open questions remain . as we have already noted , the task of calculating the relevant decay rates @xmath126 and @xmath139 is in general challenging ( despite being simpler than solving the full @xmath4-body dynamics ) .",
    "although we have shown that certain simplifications arise when the single - particle random walk dynamics are time - reversal symmetric , there is of course a much larger class of processes that do not respect this symmetry : these have nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "here we have not been able to show a result analogous to that derived in section  [ 1vs2sec ] , that is , to show that the relaxation rate to two - particle quasi - stationarity exceeds the relaxation rate to a single - particle nonequilibrium steady state , although intuitively one might expect this to be the case .",
    "furthermore , we do not know of any convenient means to bound the asymptotic reaction rate in these models .",
    "although we have found that we recover known results for discrete - frequency models , or obtain good agreement with simulations , in the limit @xmath243 , as we noted in section  [ dcfsec ] , this correspondence relies on the limits of infinite local subpopulation size and vanishing migration rate to commute .",
    "again , we are not aware of a proof that this should be the case .",
    "at the end of section  [ redsec ] we commented that the initial condition on the diffusion equation may be modified as the system evolves into the quasi - stationary state : further clarity here would be beneficial .",
    "additionally , although the coordinate @xmath0 is sufficient to track the degree of order present in a system , other aspects of the evolution can not be determined from this quantity alone  for example , the typical state of the system or correlation length given some value of @xmath0 .",
    "it is possible that some of these quantities can be obtained with knowledge of the quasi - stationary eigenvector @xmath163 , this by definition encapsulates two - point correlations .",
    "it is unclear whether higher - point correlation functions could be inferred from the two - point functions , or whether these would need to be determined separately .",
    "finally , we revisit the fundamental property shared by the entire set of random - copying processes discussed here , namely , that all species are equivalent .",
    "there is considerable interest in those cases where one species is fitter than another .",
    "although in some sense this is only a minor modification to the dynamics , the mathematics become much more involved . in particular , the backward - time dynamics are more complicated : the reaction rates then depend on the frequencies of different species in the population at the point in history at which the coalescence reaction takes place .",
    "it may , however , be possible to apply the results obtained here for the neutral theory in some kind of perturbation theory to study the effects of a small selective advantage .",
    "we leave this as one of many possibilities for future work .",
    "i thank the rcuk for the support of an academic fellowship , alan mckane and gareth baxter for useful discussions during the early development of this work and all those colleagues who have commented on preliminary accounts presented at conferences and research seminars .",
    "in section  [ dcfsec ] it was noted that a convergence theorem due to mhle @xcite implies that if one takes the between - site copying rates @xmath281 @xmath282 at any fixed subpopulation size @xmath10 , the discrete - frequency ( @xmath30 ) dynamics is recovered . in this appendix",
    "we provide an informal account of this mathematical result that illustrates how this limit is reached .",

    "the projector @xmath295 performs an infinite number of local copying events on every site .",
