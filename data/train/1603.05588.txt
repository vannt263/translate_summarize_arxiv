    "by measurements of the higgs boson property at the lhc run - i@xcite , it has been found that the standard model ( sm ) , including the sector of electroweak symmetry breaking , is surely a good description of the physics at the electroweak scale .",
    "however the essence of the higgs boson has not been understood yet , and it is worth asking whether the higgs boson is really an elementary scalar or a composite state of more fundamental fields .    although the idea of the higgs boson as an elementary scalar field may be justified in the framework of supersymmetry ( susy ) at the tev scale , predicted superpartner particles have not been discovered up to now at lhc . in this situation ,",
    "motivation for a scenario of the higgs boson as a composite state becomes stronger .    in particular , with the measured mass of the higgs boson to be 125  gev ,",
    "it is interesting to consider the scenario originally proposed by gerogi and kaplan@xcite , where the higgs boson is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a global symmetry above the tev scale . models based on this idea are called as composite higgs models , which draw a lot of attention recently@xcite .    the minimal composite higgs model ( mchm)@xcite is known as a minimal realisation of the composite higgs models , where the approximate global symmetry so(5)@xmath0 u(1)@xmath1 is spontaneously broken into so(4)@xmath0u(1)@xmath1 at the scale @xmath2 . associated with the symmetry breaking , four pngbs appear , which are identified as the four component fields in the higgs doublet of the sm .",
    "there are several attempts to probe the mchms by phenomenological study at the present and future collider experiments@xcite .",
    "the induced higgs potential depends on which representations of so(5 ) the matter fermions are embedded into .",
    "the higgs boson couplings with the matter fermions such as yukawa couplings are also determined by the representations of the matter fermions . in the literature ,",
    "different patterns of the deviations of the coupling constants from the sm predictions are shown in different mchms@xcite . therefore",
    ", measuring the deviation pattern at collider experiments is critical to distinguish a variety of the mchms .    in this paper , we investigate collider phenomenology of the mchms . because of the deviations of the higgs boson couplings from the sm prediction , the production cross section and the branching ratios of the higgs boson are different from those in the sm .",
    "we first clarify the constraint on the compositeness parameter in the mchms at the lhc run - i .",
    "we then discuss double higgs boson production at lhc and future electron - positron colliders , taking into account the constraint .    at the lhc run - i",
    ", single higgs boson production has been measured in various decay modes , and no significant deviation from the sm has been detected yet . in the literature@xcite , the constraint on the compositeness parameter is obtained in the case of the universal scale factors for the yukawa couplings . in models with non - universal scale factors",
    ", the constraint should be extracted from the signal strength of individual production and decay mode measured at the lhc run - i@xcite .    with taking into account the constraint ,",
    "we evaluate cross sections of double higgs boson production at lhc with the collision energy of 14  tev in several mchms , and discuss the possibility to distinguish among different mchms . the search for double higgs boson production process at lhc can access to the coupling deviation which does not contribute to the single higgs boson production .",
    "while there have already been several phenomenological studies of the double higgs boson production at lhc in the context of mchms@xcite , we here study the process from the viewpoint of the discrimination of the matter sector in various mchms .    the double higgs boson production process at future electron - positron colliders such as the international linear collider ( ilc)@xcite and the compact linear collider ( clic)@xcite can give complementary information of the new physics . at the electron - positron colliders ,",
    "the double higgs boson production cross section can be measured as a function of the collision energy .",
    "it is known that the production cross section has a specific energy dependence on new physics models@xcite .",
    "we estimate production cross sections for double higgs boson production processes in mchms , and show their energy dependences .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief review of the framework of the mchm .",
    "we introduce three different mchms as benchmark models , and list deviation patterns in higgs boson coupling constants from the sm predictions and decay branching ratios of the higgs boson . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the present bound on the model parameter from the lhc run - i data , and we discuss the double higgs boson production process at lhc and a future electron - positron collider experiment . summary and conclusion are shown in sec .",
    "in this section , we give a brief review on the mchm for self consistency . in the mchm@xcite ,",
    "four components of the sm - like higgs boson doublet are identified with the four pngbs associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath3 .",
    "the low energy effective lagrangian can be constructed by utilising a nonlinear representation of the global symmetry group . since @xmath4 in @xmath5 is gauged , the global symmetry is explicitly broken by the gauge couplings .",
    "the matter fermions in the sm by themselves can not consist @xmath6 multiplet .",
    "they should be embedded into @xmath6 representations , and the components of the multiplets other than the sm fermions are decoupled from the effective theory .",
    "the yukawa coupling with the matter fermions of the sm also explicitly breaks the global @xmath6 symmetry . due to these explicit breaking effects of the global symmetry ,",
    "the higgs potential is effectively generated via the loop contributions of weak gauge bosons and the sm fermions .",
    "the sm fermion contribution @xmath7 strongly depends on how the sm fermion fields are embedded into @xmath6 multiplets .",
    "the detail of the model dependence of the higgs potential in the mchms are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . by solving the stationary condition ,",
    "the higgs field can have non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "we summarise deviations in the higgs boson couplings from the sm predictions in the different mchms . in order to describe the deviation pattern in each mchm , it is convenient to use the scale factors @xmath8 , which are defined by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denote the coupling constants of the higgs boson coupling with the weak gauge bosons @xmath11 and @xmath12 , matter fermions and the higgs boson itself as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we simply write @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . for @xmath23 couplings ,",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath24 . in the effective theories of the mchms , new dimension",
    "five operators of two higgs bosons and two fermions such as @xmath25 are induced .",
    "we parameterise the coupling constant for @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "the four point interactions such as @xmath23 and @xmath25 play important roles in our analysis .    in the mchms , the couplings between the higgs boson and the weak gauge bosons deviate from the sm predictions as @xmath27 , which leads to @xmath28 , no matter how the sm fermions are embedded into @xmath6 representations .",
    "it is the universal prediction of the mchms . here",
    "the compositeness parameter @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the vev of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the coupling constants of the contact interaction @xmath23 are also determined universal in the mchms as @xmath32 .",
    "the universal reduction of @xmath33 is a notable feature of the mchms . in the higgs sector with multi - doublet structure such as that in the minimal susy sm",
    ", the coupling constants @xmath33 are given by the gauge coupling constants as the same as those in the sm .",
    "on the other hand , yukawa coupling constants with the matter fermions as well as the self - coupling of the higgs boson are determined by the matter sector of the mchms .",
    "as described above , the matter fermions of the sm are embedded into a representation of @xmath6 .",
    "we can individually embed @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . depending on the choices for charge assignment for fermions , a variety of the models",
