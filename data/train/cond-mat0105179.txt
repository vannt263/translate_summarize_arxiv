    "recent progress in theoretical and experimental studies has clarified many properties of glass transitions  @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism of the glass transition has not yet been fully understood  @xcite .",
    "the major issue is the experimental approach to the investigation of the length scale of the glass transition and dynamics of the @xmath0-process such as dynamical heterogeneity  @xcite . according to the adam and gibbs theory ,",
    "the dynamics of glass transitions are associated with cooperative motions which are characterized by a so - called _ cooperatively rearranging region _ ( crr ) , in which molecules move cooperatively with each other  @xcite .",
    "the size of the crr is assumed to increase as temperature decreases to the glass transition temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the characteristic length scale associated with such cooperative motions has been investigated by multi - dimensional nmr  @xcite , dielectric hole burning  @xcite and photobleaching  @xcite for bulk systems .",
    "another approach to studying the length scale is the investigation of the finite size effect on glass transition dynamics through confined systems such as thin polymer films  @xcite or small molecules in nanopores  @xcite .",
    "the first direct measurement of the reduction in @xmath8 in thin polymer films has been made by keddie _",
    "et  al . _ in 1994  @xcite . in their work",
    ", the film thickness of the thin films of polystyrene ( ps ) supported on a hydrogen passivated silicon wafer has been measured as a function of temperature by an ellipsometer .",
    "the results showed that the observed @xmath8 in such thin films can be described as a function of film thickness , @xmath9 , as follows : @xmath10,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the best - fit parameters are @xmath11=373.8k , @xmath12=1.3@xmath13 nm , and @xmath14=1.28@xmath150.20  @xcite . the molecular weight ( @xmath16 ) dependence of @xmath17 has not been observed for @xmath16 range from 1.2@xmath18 to 2.9@xmath19 , and hence it was concluded that the confinement effect of polymer chains within thin layers may be neglected in such systems .",
    "further measurements of @xmath8 in thin films of poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) supported on two different kinds of substrate revealed that the strong attractive interactions between substrate and polymers lead to increase in @xmath8 with decreasing film thickness  @xcite .    in order to remove such interactions between substrate and polymers , forrest",
    "_ et al . _ measured @xmath8 for _ freely standing films _ of polystyrene by brillouin light scattering measurements  @xcite .",
    "they obtained the thickness dependence of @xmath8 as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath11 is the glass transition temperature for thick films , @xmath21 is the constant and @xmath22 is the critical thickness .",
    "the critical thickness @xmath22 , below which @xmath8 decreases linearly with decreasing film thickness , depends on the molecular weight , @xmath23 , @xmath22 increases with the molecular weight in a way similar to the radius of gyration of polymer chains .    in our previous papers",
    ", we performed electric capacitance measurements for thin films of polystyrene supported on al - deposited glass substrate and determined the @xmath8 as a temperature at which the temperature dependence of capacitance changes discontinuously  @xcite . as a result",
    ", we confirmed the reduction of @xmath8 in our system in a way similar to eq.([tg_keddie ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we made volume relaxation measurements on thin polystyrene films and measured the temperature @xmath1 at which the imaginary component of complex thermal expansion coefficient has a peak at a given very low frequency corresponding to the relaxation time about 100 sec during the heating process of a constant rate  @xcite .",
    "the temperature @xmath1 thereby obtained can be regarded as the glass transition temperature @xmath8 . in our measurements",
    "it is found that @xmath8 decreases slightly with decreasing film thickness down to a critical thickness @xmath7 , and below @xmath7 it decreases very rapidly .",
    "the value of @xmath7 changes with @xmath16 in the similar way to the radius of gyration of polymer chains .",
    "this behavior of @xmath8 is quite similar to those obtained in freely standing films as shown in eq.([tg_forrest ] ) except the slight change in @xmath8 above @xmath7 .",
    "intensive investigations have been performed so far mainly on polystyrene films  @xcite .",
    "it is important to clarify whether the results extracted from the investigations on thin polystyrene films hold also for other polymers . in this paper , therefore , we investigate the dynamics of thin films of poly(vinyl acetate)(pvac ) and pmma by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy .",
    "pvac is a polymer suitable for dielectric relaxation measurements because a monomer unit of pvac has a large dipole moment  @xcite . in pmma",
    ", there is a strong @xmath2-process which is due to the hindered rotation of the side group in addition to the @xmath0-process  @xcite .",
    "it is indispensable to investigate the size dependence of dynamics of the @xmath0-process and the @xmath2-process when elucidating the nature of glass transition .",
    "this paper consists of five sections . after the introduction , experimental details on preparation method of thin films and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy",
    "are given in sec.ii .",
    "in sec.iii , experimental results on poly(vinyl acetate ) and poly(methyl methacrylate ) by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy are shown .",
    "in particular , thickness dependence of the temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath3 corresponding to the @xmath0- and @xmath2-peaks in the dielectric loss and the width of the distribution of the relaxation time of the @xmath0- and @xmath2-processes are focused in sec.iii .",
    "discussions on the present experimental results compared with the results reported previously are given in sec.iv and a summary is given in sec.v .",
    "the polymer samples used in this study ( pvac and pmma ) are purchased from scientific polymer products , inc .",
    "the molecular weight and radius of gyration of the polymers are listed in table i. the glass transition temperatures of pvac and pmma in the bulk states are 303k and 373k , respectively .",
    "thin polymer films were prepared by spin - coating a toluene solution of pvac ( pmma ) onto al - deposited glass substrate .",
    "film thickness is controlled by changing the concentration of the solution .",
    "the thin films obtained by spin - coat method were annealed _ in vacuo _ for 48 hours at 303k for pvac and 353k for pmma , respectively .",
    "after annealing , al was vacuum - deposited once more onto the thin films to serve an upper electrode .",
    "dielectric measurements were performed by using an lcr meter ( hp4284a ) for the frequency range from 20hz to 1mhz and an impedance analyzer ( solartron instruments",
    "si1260 ) for the frequency range from 0.1hz to 1mhz .",
    "the temperature of a sample cell was changed between 273k and 373k for pvac and between 263k and 423k for pmma at a constant rate of 0.5k / min .",
    "the dielectric measurements during the heating and cooling processes were performed repeatedly several times .",
    "data acquisition was made during the above cycles except the first cycle .",
    "the good reproducibility of dielectric data was obtained after the first cycle .    the thickness @xmath9 is related to the electric capacitance @xmath24 of thin films in the following way : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the permittivity of the vacuum , @xmath27 is the permittivity of the polymer ( pvac or pmma ) and @xmath28 is the effective area of the electrode ( @xmath28=8.0mm@xmath29 ) .",
    "for the frequency range where there are no contributions due to any dielectric dispersion , @xmath27 can be regarded as constant for any change in frequency , and hence the film thickness is inversely proportional to the electric capacitance .",
    "relative film thickness at a given temperature can be obtained from the electric capacitance of the thin films at a frequency within the above frequency range . the frequency and the temperature we chose for the determination of the relative thickness are 8khz and 298k for pvac , and 1khz and 273k for pmma .",
    "the absolute values of the film thickness for several films were measured directly by an atomic force microscope ( shimadzu spm-9500 ) in order to calibrate the film thickness .    as shown in a previous paper  @xcite ,",
    "the resistance of the al electrodes can not be neglected for dielectric measurements of very thin films .",
    "this resistance leads to an artifact loss peak on the high frequency side ; this peak results from the fact that the system is equivalent to a series circuit of a capacitor and resistor  @xcite .",
    "because the peak shape in the frequency domain is described by a debye - type equation , the `` c - r peak '' can easily be subtracted .",
    "the data thus corrected were used for further analysis in the frequency domain .",
    "figure 1 shows the dependence of the complex electric capacitance ( @xmath30 ) on the logarithm of frequency at various temperatures for thin films of pvac with @xmath16=1.8@xmath510@xmath6 and film thicknesses ( a ) @xmath9=440 nm and ( b ) @xmath9=16 nm . in this figure",
    ", we find that the imaginary component @xmath31 has a peak due to the @xmath0-process .",
    "the peak frequency shifts to the higher frequency side as temperature increases . comparing fig.1(a ) and",
    "fig.1(b ) , we find that the peak position shifts to the higher frequency side at a fixed temperature as the film thickness decreases from 440 nm to 16 nm .",
    "the temperature change in the dielectric loss at 100hz normalized with the peak value for the bulk sample is shown in fig.2 in the case of pvac with @xmath16=1.8@xmath510@xmath6 .",
    "the dielectric peak due to the @xmath0-process possesses a maximum at the temperature @xmath1 .",
    "it is found in fig.2 that the temperature @xmath1 decreases with decreasing film thickness . at the same time",
    "the peak width of the @xmath0-process increases and the height at @xmath1 decreases with decreasing film thickness .",
    "this behavior is related to the change in the distribution of the relaxation times and the relaxation strength with the film thickness .",
    "figure 3 displays the temperature dependence of the frequency @xmath32 of the @xmath0-process for thin films of pvac with three different thicknesses 440 nm , 62 nm , and 18 nm , where @xmath32 is associated with a characteristic time of the @xmath0-process @xmath33 via the relation @xmath34=1 .",
    "each point in fig.3 consists of a data set ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) . for each film thickness",

    "this thickness dependence of @xmath32 ( and @xmath33 ) becomes stronger as the temperature approaches the glass transition temperature .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to that observed in thin films of ps supported on glass substrate  @xcite .    in order to check how",
    "the @xmath0-process changes with film thickness , the thickness dependence of the temperature @xmath1 at the frequency 100hz is shown in fig.4 for three different molecular weights 1.2@xmath510@xmath6 , 1.8@xmath510@xmath6 and 2.4@xmath510@xmath6 .",
    "the error bars in fig.4 stand for the standard deviation in @xmath1 for the data acquired by measurements done repeatedly several times . because the glass transition temperature @xmath8 can be regarded as the value of @xmath1 obtained for a very low frequency of the applied electric field , for example , @xmath41 sec ) , the absolute value of @xmath8 is lower than that of the @xmath1 for @xmath32=100hz .",
    "however , it is possible to extract qualitative information on the thickness dependence of @xmath8 from the observed thickness dependence of @xmath1 in fig.4 .",
    "the solid curve in fig.4 is obtained by using the same form of eq.([tg_keddie ] ) in which @xmath8 is replaced by @xmath1 with parameters as follows : @xmath42=334.3@xmath150.1k , @xmath43 nm , @xmath44 . because the single curve can reproduce the observed values of @xmath1 for the three different molecular weights , the temperature @xmath1 seems to have almost no @xmath16 dependence and hence we conjecture that @xmath8 is also independent of the molecular weight for @xmath16=1.2@xmath510@xmath6 - 2.4@xmath510@xmath6 and @xmath4510 nm .    in order to discuss the dynamics of the @xmath0-process in thin films of pvac , the observed complex dielectric constant @xmath46 in fig.1 is fitted to the following model function : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the permittivity at a very high frequency . the second term in the r.h.s .",

    "the fitted value of @xmath51 was found to be between 0.40 and 0.93 depending on film thickness . the third term in the r.h.s .",
    "comes from the @xmath0-process and its form is empirically proposed by havriliak - negami  @xcite , where @xmath52 is the relaxation strength , @xmath53 is the characteristic time , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the shape parameters .    the thickness dependence of the relaxation strength @xmath52 obtained from the observed values of @xmath46 at 333k is shown in fig.5 for thin films of pvac with @xmath16=2.4@xmath510@xmath6 , where @xmath52 is normalized with respect to the value of @xmath52 for the bulk sample ( see open circles ) .",
    "the temperature 333k was chosen because the dielectric loss peak of the @xmath0-process is located at the center of the frequency window in the present measurement at this temperature .",

    "therefore , it is expected that the thickness and @xmath16 dependence of @xmath1 in thin films supported on substrate can be compared with that of @xmath8 in freely standing thin films .",
    "for this reason , the observed results on @xmath1 in thin films of pvac may correspond to the low @xmath16 regime observed by mattsson _",
    "_ in the freely standing films of ps . in the regime , _ confinement effect of polymer chains",
    "_ within thin films is not dominant for the reduction of @xmath8 or @xmath1 , but _ the finite size effects _ due to a length scale intrinsic to the glass transition may be dominant . if we measure @xmath1 for thin films of pvac with still higher molecular weights , however , @xmath16 dependence of @xmath1 @xmath103 @xmath9 may be observed in a similar way to @xmath8 in the freely standing films of ps .      in pmma , it can be expected that the characteristic length scale of the @xmath2-process , if any , should be smaller than that of the @xmath0-process , because the characteristic time of the @xmath2-process at a fixed temperature in the temperature range investigated here is much shorter than that of the @xmath0-process . in this case",
    ", the thickness dependence of @xmath1 should be stronger than that of @xmath3 at a fixed frequency .",
    "however , the observed results do not obey this expectation ; as shown in fig.11 , for @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) , @xmath1 remains _ almost independent of thickness _ and @xmath3 _ decreases slightly with decreasing film thickness_.    according to a layer model , as discussed in the literature  @xcite , @xmath8 and the dynamics of thin films are controlled by the competition between the two different effects .",
    "firstly , the existence of a mobile layer near surfaces leads to the speed - up of the dynamics of the @xmath0-process ( and also the @xmath2-process ) . within the mobile layer",
    "molecular motions are enhanced compared with those in the bulk state .",
    "the origin of the enhancement of molecular motion is supposed to be due to the higher density of chain ends of polymer chains  @xcite or to the restriction on cooperative motions characteristic of the glass transition within the surface layer  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the layer thickness of the mobile layer is of an order of the size of the cooperatively rearranging region ( crr )  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the attractive interaction between the polymers and the substrate leads to slowing - down of the dynamics of the motion  @xcite . for example , the adsorption of polymer chains onto the substrate causes @xmath8 of the thin films to increase compared with that in the bulk state .    in the case of thin films of pmma",
    ", it has been reported that the glass transition temperature strongly depends on the interaction between the polymers and the substrate .",
    "_ show that _ the @xmath8 increases with decreasing film thickness _ for sio@xmath106 substrate , while _ it decreases with decreasing film thickness _ for au substrate  @xcite .",
    "local thermal analysis measurements showed that @xmath8 of thin films of pmma supported on sio@xmath107 is by 7k higher for @xmath9=20 nm than that for the bulk films , while @xmath8 on sio@xmath107 with hexamethyldisilizane is by 10k lower for @xmath9=20 nm  @xcite . in thin films of pmma supported on al deposited silicon substrate , it is reported that @xmath8 of thin films with @xmath9=40 nm is higher by 14@xmath154 k than that of bulk pmma  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the effect of the interaction between the polymer and the substrate is sensitive to the condition of the surface of the substrate in thin films of pmma . in the @xmath0-process in pmma on al - deposited substrate",
    "the mobile layer associated with cooperative length scale of the glass transition tends to reduce @xmath8 and @xmath1 , while the attractive interaction between the polymer and the substrate tends to increase them . as a result ,",
    "the two effects cancel out and the observed value of @xmath1 may _ remain almost constant _ for @xmath104 , as shown in fig.11(a ) . for the @xmath2-process",
    ", it is expected that the two effects no longer cancel out and the mobile layer has dominant effect on @xmath3 . in order to check the validity of the above idea",
    ", we should measure @xmath1 and @xmath3 of pmma thin films for a substrate which has almost no attractive interaction between the polymer and the substrate .",
    "in such a case , it is expected that as the thickness decreases @xmath1 decreases faster than @xmath3 does .    in the present measurements ,",
    "it is observed that for @xmath108 a drastic decrease in @xmath1 begins with decreasing film thickness . to our surprise , @xmath3 also begins to decrease drastically with decreasing film thickness at almost the same film thickness @xmath109 .",
    "this indicates that there is a strong correlation between the @xmath0-process and the @xmath2-process in pmma thin films , although both the processes are located away from each other in the dispersion map ( fig.10 ) .",
    "both the values of @xmath85 and @xmath110 agree well with the radius of gyration of the polymer chain ( @xmath11118.6 nm ) , and hence this behavior may be controlled by the polymeric nature of pmma .",
    "the drastic change at @xmath85 implies the crossover from the normal @xmath0-process to other type of dynamics .",
    "recently , de gennes proposed sliding motion , which can be activated via a soft skin layer near the surface instead of normal @xmath0-dynamics  @xcite .",
    "below @xmath7 , the sliding motion may be activated in this case .",
    "the measurements of @xmath16 dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath3 for thin films of pmma are highly desirable in order to clarify the nature of the above behavior on @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the distribution of the relaxation times of the @xmath0-process @xmath33 in thin films of pvac has been found to become broader with decreasing film thickness .",
    "the width @xmath64 of the distribution in pvac with @xmath9=9.5 nm is about 2.5 times as broad as that in bulk pvac .",
    "on the other hand , the width @xmath64 for the @xmath2-process in thin films of pmma depends on film thickness much more weakly , as shown in fig.8(a ) .",
    "the corresponding width @xmath112 in temperature domain has a similar thickness dependence , @xmath23 , the thickness dependence of @xmath113 is much weaker than that of @xmath70 in pmma . from these observations , it is found that the distribution of relaxation times of the @xmath0-process depends on film thickness much stronger than that of the @xmath2-process .",
    "the intrinsic length scale of the @xmath2-process is expected to be much smaller than that of the @xmath0-process , as deduced from fig.10 .",
    "the present observation on the thickness dependence of the distribution of the relaxation times is consistent with this expectation .",
    "as shown in fig.2 , the dielectric loss peak due to the @xmath0-process becomes more depressed with decreasing film thickness .",
    "this is consistent with the result that the relaxation strength @xmath52 decreases with decreasing film thickness , as shown in fig.5 .",
    "the thickness dependence of @xmath52 is found to obey eq.([de1 ] ) . here",
    ", we will try to give a possible explanation on the decrease in @xmath52 with decreasing thickness .",
    "if there is no interaction between dipole moments , the relaxation strength @xmath114 is described as follows : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the dipole number density , @xmath117 is the dipole moment of the relaxing unit , @xmath118 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath83 is the temperature",
    ". now it is assumed that _",
    "@xmath119 neighboring dipole moments are relaxed in a cooperative manner_. then @xmath116 and @xmath117 should be replaced by @xmath120 and @xmath121 in eq.([delta_e ] ) , respectively . as a result",
    ", we obtain the relaxation strength @xmath122 for such a cooperative motion in the following way : @xmath123 here , it can be expected that the number @xmath119 is proportional to the intrinsic length of the motion in question . because cooperative motions are restricted near surfaces or interfaces , the intrinsic length of the motions may be reduced and @xmath119 is decreased .",
    "therefore , @xmath52 of the region near surfaces and interfaces can be expected to be smaller than that of the bulk system . by averaging along the direction normal to the film surface ,",
    "the relaxation strength @xmath52 is expressed by @xmath124,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 is the effective thickness of the surface region , @xmath9 is the overall thickness , and @xmath99 and @xmath126 are the relaxation strength of the bulk region and the surface regions , respectively . here ,",
    "the relation @xmath127 is satisfied . on the basis of this simple picture , the observed thickness dependence of @xmath52 in eq.([de1 ] ) can be reproduced .",
    "the value of @xmath100 is given by @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , the observed result on @xmath52 in the present measurements is consistent with the idea of cooperative motions .",
    "we made dielectric relaxation measurements for thin films of poly(vinyl acetate ) and poly(methyl methacrylate ) supported on al deposited glass substrate .",
    "the results obtained in the present measurements are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the temperature @xmath1 corresponding to the peak in the dielectric loss due to the @xmath0-process at 100hz is measured as a function of film thickness for thin films of pvac with three different molecular weights @xmath16=1.2@xmath510@xmath6 , 1.8@xmath510@xmath6 and 2.4@xmath510@xmath6 . it is found that @xmath1 decreases gradually with decreasing film thickness and the decreasing rate of @xmath1 increases more and more in thinner films .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1 has almost no molecular weight dependence .",
    "the width of the distribution of the relaxation times of the @xmath0-process increases with decreasing film thickness , while the relaxation strength of the @xmath0-process decreases with decreasing film thickness .",
    "3 .   the thickness dependence of the temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath3 corresponding to the peaks in the dielectric loss due to the @xmath0- and @xmath2-processes at 40hz , respectively , are measured for thin films of pmma with @xmath16=4.9@xmath510@xmath6 . the temperature @xmath1 remains almost constant as the thickness is decreased down to a critical thickness @xmath85 , at which point it begins to decrease with thickness .",
    "the value of @xmath84 is about 20 nm . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature @xmath3 decreases slightly with decreasing film thickness from the bulk to a critical thickness @xmath110 .",
    "below @xmath110 @xmath3 decreases more rapidly with decreasing film thickness .",
    "the value of @xmath110 is almost equal to @xmath85 .",
    "the widths @xmath70 and @xmath71 of the peaks in dielectric loss in the temperature domain are measured for both the @xmath0- and @xmath2-processes in thin films of pmma with @xmath16=4.9@xmath510@xmath6 .",
    "as the thickness is decreased , the width @xmath70 increases much faster than @xmath71 .",
    "this indicates that the broadening of the distribution of relaxation times of the @xmath0-process is much more sensitive to the change in thickness than that of the @xmath2-process .    in this paper , several length scales characteristic of the thickness change in @xmath1 , @xmath70 , @xmath3 , @xmath113 , @xmath52 , and @xmath64",
    "have been introduced .",
    "the physical quantities such as @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath64 and @xmath52 have been found to be described by the linear equation of the reciprocal of @xmath9 .",
    "this result suggests that a layer model be applicable to explain the thickness dependence , as shown in iv.d . in such cases ,",
    "the characteristic lengths @xmath68 and @xmath100 are correlated with the thickness of the surface layer @xmath125 , which can be expected to be comparable to the size of the crr . on the other hand , the crossover thicknesses @xmath85 and @xmath110 are almost equal to the radius of gyration of the polymer chain and are expected to be molecular weight dependent .",
    "these crossover thicknesses may be strongly associated with dynamics of polymer chains . in order to understand the present experimental results ,",
    "a model will be required , where the nature of polymer dynamics is taken into account as well as the intrinsic nature of the glass transition .",
