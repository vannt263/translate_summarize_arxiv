    "<S> the @xmath0sn(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3cd reaction at 392 mev is investigated with the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) framework . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this reaction is very peripheral mainly because of the strong absorption of @xmath4 by the reaction residue @xmath3cd , and the @xmath4-clustering on the nuclear surface can be probed clearly . </S>",
