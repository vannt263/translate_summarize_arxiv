    "it is well known that our own galaxy is not isolated , residing with m31 and a host of smaller galaxies in the local group .",
    "large area surveys have confirmed that the local group is not exceptional , but rather representative of an extremely common environment ( e.g. geller & huchra 1983 ; eke _ et  al . _  2004",
    "; weinmann _ et  al . _",
    "however , despite the apparent commonality of the group environment , the astrophysical processes acting within groups and their effects on observed galaxy populations are relatively poorly understood .",
    "this is due to both the low galaxy numbers and galaxy surface densities typically associated with groups that make them observationally expensive .",
    "consequently , it is observations of galaxy clusters that have largely driven our current understanding of environmental effects on galaxy populations , namely that galaxies in clusters are redder ( e.g. butcher & oemler 1984 ) and morphologically earlier types ( e.g. dressler 1980 ) relative to galaxies in the field .",
    "the expected correlation of star formation rate with density , based on the morphology - density and morphology - radius relations , has led observers to measure star formation rates as a function of environment in large samples such as the 2dfgrs ( e.g. lewis _ et  al . _",
    "2002 ) and sdss ( e.g. gmez _ et  al . _",
    "these authors have found that star formation rates decrease as one moves from the field to cluster environment .",
    "perhaps more interestingly , however , is that the observed star formation truncation is associated with local density rather than physical proximity to a cluster , and therefore the physical mechanisms responsible are acting primarily in lower density , group - like environments .",
    "this has been confirmed by studies attempting to link field and cluster galaxies , which find observed cluster populations can not be generated directly from the accretion of field galaxies .",
    "galaxy groups , therefore , _ must _ be playing a significant role as an intermediary stage in galaxy evolution ( e.g. kodama & smail 2001 ; fujita 2003 ) .",
    "after initial violent relaxation where galaxies are dominated by a collective potential ( lynden - bell 1967 ) , the dynamics of group and cluster galaxies are predominantly affected on more local scales . of the several possible mechanisms driving galaxy evolution , those dependent on the size of the potential well ( e.g. harassment ; moore 1996 ) or density of the intra - cluster medium ( e.g. ram - pressure stripping ; gunn & gott 1972 ) will be most effective in clusters .",
    "conversely , the low - velocity group environment favours mergers as the preferred method of relaxation due to the growing efficiency of dynamical friction at low relative velocities .",
    "it has been shown that mergers can lead to both morphology and luminosity segregation ( fusco - femiano & menci 1998 ; yepes , domnguez - tenreiro & del pozo - sanz 1991 ) , and observations suggest that galaxies are segregated in both groups ( mahdavi _ et  al . _  1999 ; girardi _ et  al . _",
    "2003 ) and clusters ( adami , biviano & mazure 1998 ; biviano _ et  al . _  2002",
    "; lares , lambas & snchez 2004 ) . since mergers will also affect the relative number of galaxies at a given luminosity",
    ", one might expect the prevalence of mergers in groups to influence the shape of the group luminosity function .",
    "this is , in fact , a possible explanation of the commonly observed `` dip '' , indicative of intermediate mass galaxies merging to form more luminous ones ( e.g. trentham & tully 2002 ; miles _",
    "et  al . _",
    "it is also worth noting that recent observations of ram - pressure stripping in groups ( e.g. bureau & carignan 2002 ; kantharia _ et  al . _  2005",
    "; rasmussen , ponman & mulchaey 2006 ) support the results of numerical simulations which suggest that group - level ram - pressure stripping could also play some role in group galaxy evolution ( hester 2006 ) .",
    "typical studies of poor groups may classify 10 - 20 galaxies as group members , the majority of which have had their membership assigned using photometric or morphological criteria .",
    "more robust studies have included only galaxies for which recession velocity measurements are available ( e.g. zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ; carlberg _ et  al . _  2001",
    "; brough _ et  al . _",
    "2006a ) , however this often leads to the need to stack groups in order to measure their properties due to the low numbers of redshifts typically available .",
    "the problem with stacking groups , however , is that while it is then possible to constrain the generalised global properties of groups ( e.g. mass distribution , velocity dispersion profile etc . )",
    "the individual properties of any single group are washed out .    here",
    "we aim to address this issue by establishing the properties of the ngc5044 group and its galaxies independently . by studying a single rich group",
    "we are able to examine evidence for dynamical segregation , substructure and peculiarities in its dynamical properties that are washed out when stacking multiple groups .",
    "in this paper , we present new deep spectroscopic data that allow us to spectroscopically confirm @xmath6 new group members . with the addition of these velocities",
    ", we create a new list of 111 confirmed group members that then allows a comprehensive analysis of the dynamical attributes of the ngc5044 group and its constituent galaxies out to nearly two virial radii . in future work",
    "we will use these data to examine the stellar populations of the group galaxies in relation to their position in the group , hi gas properties , star formation rates and dynamical properties .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in @xmath7[n5044 ] and @xmath7[data ] we describe some general properties of the ngc5044 group and the data set we have assembled .",
    "@xmath7[fof ] describes the method we have used to select group members from our list of potential candidates .",
    "the global group properties are addressed in @xmath7[global ] , and the properties related to individual galaxies are summarised in @xmath7[galaxy ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath8 = 70kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 where applicable and recession velocities are quoted in terms of c@xmath10 .",
    "we adopt the distance modulus of tonry _",
    "et  al . _  ( 2001 ) , @xmath11 ( 28.99mpc ) , measured using surface brightness fluctuations with corrections applied to adjust for the improved cepheid distance measurements of jensen _",
    "et  al . _  ( 2003 ) .",
    "magnitudes have been corrected for galactic extinction using the dust maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) . following convention we use @xmath12 to denote 2d , projected radii and @xmath13 to indicate 3d , deprojected radii .",
    "we have selected the ngc5044 group as the focus of this work as it is our goal to describe the properties of a _ single _ group , and its large galaxy population is sufficient to perform a statistical analysis .",
    "ferguson & sandage ( 1990 , hereafter fs90 ; 1991 , hereafter fs91 ) photometrically studied 7 nearby groups and clusters , including ngc5044 , constructing group luminosity functions and examining the relative fractions of dwarf and giant galaxies . in their work ,",
    "fs91 show that the early - type dwarf to giant ratio ( edgr ) correlates nearly monotonically with richness .",
    "the intermediate richness of the ngc5044 group , means that its edgr occupies the transition between groups and clusters .",
    "they also found evidence for a steep faint - end luminosity function in the ngc5044 group , however their photometric selection is likely to contain significant background contamination .",
    "the ngc5044 group has also been studied as part of the group evolution multi - wavelength survey ( gems ; osmond & ponman 2004 ; forbes _ et  al . _",
    "2006 ) and so has been observed at both x - ray and hi wavelengths ( osmond & ponman 2004 ; mckay _ et  al . _  2004",
    "; kilborn _ et  al . _  in preparation , hereafter k08 ) .",
    "the gems group sample was selected from the availability of rosat pspc pointings .",
    "further x - ray observations of the ngc5044 group have been carried out using both chandra and xmm  newton ( buote _ et  al . _  2003",
    "; tamura _ et  al . _  2003",
    "; buote , brighenti & mathews 2004 ) .",
    "these authors found the group to have a cool - core component of @xmath50.7kev within 10kpc ( consistent with the kinetic temperature of stars in ngc5044 itself ) , and a warmer 1.4kev outside of 40kpc ( characteristic of the group halo ) .",
    "the large radial extent of x - ray emission ( @xmath1460kpc ) and high @xmath15 ratio ( @xmath16ergs s@xmath9l@xmath17 ; osmond & ponman 2004 ) are key indications that the hot gas is associated with a group sized potential rather than just ngc5044 itself .",
    "we used the photometrically determined ngc5044 group catalogue of fs90 as the target list for new spectral observations .",
    "the fs90 catalogue was constructed using photographic plates covering @xmath52.3deg@xmath18 taken at the 2.5 m dupont telescope at the las campanas observatory .",
    "3deg@xmath18 field - of - view allowed us to observe all 162 objects in the fs90 ngc5044 group catalogue simultaneously .",
    "fs90 used a b - band radial cut of 16@xmath19 , estimated to be 27 mag arcsec@xmath20 at the distance of ngc5044 ) , to limit background contamination .",
    "group membership was then defined using morphological criteria to differentiate between background galaxies and genuine group members .",
    "the fs90 sample for ngc5044 is complete to b@xmath2118 , and complete at the 90% level to b@xmath2119 .",
    "our spectroscopic observations of the ngc5044 group were obtained in 2006 march on the 2527@xmath22 using the aaomega multi - object spectrograph at the 3.9 m _",
    "anglo - australian telescope _ ( aat ) .",
    "spectra were taken using medium resolution 580v and 385r gratings , yielding dispersions of 3.5and 5.3fwhm respectively and spectral coverage from 37008800 .    since the targets spanned a wide range in magnitude ( @xmath23m@xmath24 ) observations",
    "were divided into two separate plate configurations to limit the effects of scattered light from the brightest sources .",
    "plate configurations used a total of 197 fibres , 162 allocated to targets and 35 placed on blank sky regions .",
    "bright ( faint ) target observations were carried out in a series of 20 ( 30 ) minute integrations , with a total of 3 - 4 such integrations per plate configuration , for a total of 4 ( 17 ) hours of observation across the 3 observing nights .",
    "data were reduced using the 2dfdr software supplied and maintained by the anglo australian observatory .",
    "this software handles over - scan subtraction , identification of the fibre apertures , fibre flat - fielding and throughput calibration , wavelength calibration , median sky subtraction and co - addition of science frames . due to known sensitivity issues in the blue arm of aaomega at the time of observing ( @xmath550% decrease from expected ) , many of the faintest objects were lost in the co - addition process as the reduced throughput resulted in these fibres being read - noise dominated .",
    "recession velocities were measured using the fourier cross - correlation routine , fxcor , in iraf .",
    "these recession velocity measurements were made for blue and red frames separately to verify the spectral wavelength solutions and recession velocity measurements .",
    "cross - correlations were performed using both absorption ( standard stars ) and emission ( rest frame emission galaxy ) templates .",
    "we preferentially use absorption line templates for cross - correlation , however in cases where absorption lines provided a poor redshift solution , emission templates were used . in this way , redshifts where measured for 103 galaxies out of the total 162 galaxy sample of fs90 .",
    "[ vel_comp ] shows the relationship between newly measured redshifts and those available in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , showing the velocity difference between the two plotted against our measured velocities .",
    "velocities are shown only for those galaxies for which we find recession velocities @xmath254000kms@xmath9(the range of interest for possible ngc5044 group members ) , however background objects with higher velocities show similar good agreement with the literature .",
    "we find no evidence for systematic variations with recession velocity out to a redshift of @xmath50.7 ( our highest redshift object ) , however based on the median absolute deviation between our velocity measurements and those in ned we adopt a systematic uncertainty of 50.7kms@xmath9 .      in order to include the most complete ngc5044 group member list available , we have used supplementary data from the second data release of the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs dr2 ; jones _",
    "et  al . _",
    "2005 ) to expand our aaomega sample .",
    "the 6dfgs is a large , 17046 deg@xmath18 survey of southern sky targets selected from the 2mass extended source catalogue ( jarrett _ et  al . _  2000",
    ") to include all galaxies brighter than @xmath26mag .",
    "to our list of possible group members we add all 6dfgs galaxies within 4 degrees of ngc5044 ( @xmath52mpc in projected separation ) and recession velocities between 500 and 5000kms@xmath9 , yielding 24 galaxies . as of 6dfgs dr2 the region surrounding ngc5044",
    "has not been surveyed completely , and so 6dfgs galaxies included here are not uniformly distributed .",
    "in particular , galaxies with declinations greater than @xmath27 ( @xmath50.65mpc north of the group centre ) are not present in the 6dfgs dr2 sample ( see fig .",
    "[ spatial ] for a more detailed footprint of 6dfgs coverage in this region ) .",
    "the ngc5044 group has been surveyed for neutral hydrogen as part of the gems project using the 20-cm multi - beam receiver on the parkes radio telescope by k08 ( see also mckay _",
    "et  al . _",
    "they surveyed a @xmath28 region centred roughly on ngc5044 and identified 23 hi detections above a mass limit of @xmath29m@xmath2 ( flux levels above 18 mjy beam@xmath9 ) .",
    "of these , 5 represent new galaxy detections which have been confirmed using high resolution imaging from the australian telescope compact array ( further details will be given in k08 ) , and so these new galaxies are included in our velocity sample .      given the incomplete spatial coverage available from the 6dfgs dr2 data we have supplemented these data using sources with known recession velocities from the ned in the same position and velocity range , providing 51 additional galaxies to our sample .",
    "the heterogeneous nature of the ned data means that an accurate estimate of incompleteness effects is difficult",
    ". however , brough _ et  al .",

    "we preferentially use 2mass k magnitudes , supplementing with p05 data where necessary .",
    "our aaomega observations have allowed us to obtain new recession velocity measurements of a significant number of galaxies for which we need to assess group membership .",
    "brough _ et  al .",
    "_  ( 2006a ; hereafter b06 ) used data from ned and 6dfgs to define the ngc5044 group using a friends - of - friends algorithm ( fof ; huchra & geller 1982 ) which selects group members down to a specified galaxy density above the critical density ( in their case , @xmath33=150@xmath34 ) .",
    "groups derived using the fof method are sensitive to the maximum allowed projected and velocity separation ( i.e. the linking length and velocity ) , the sample luminosity function and the magnitude limit of the sample .",
    "the inhomogeneous nature of our combined sample means that no single luminosity function or magnitude limit will be adequate for selection of the group using an fof algorithm , and we therefore adopt a clipping method as it requires no _ a priori _ assumptions regarding our data .",
    "membership of the ngc5044 group is assigned using an iterated velocity dispersion clipping as follows .",
    "galaxies are binned radially , using ngc5044 as the centre , and a moving mean velocity and velocity dispersion , @xmath35 , are calculated .",
    "galaxies with velocities greater than 3@xmath35 from the moving mean are removed from the group member list and the process is repeated until no additional galaxies are removed .",
    "velocity clipping is particularly well suited to this sample as the ngc5044 group is well separated in velocity space from background contamination , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vel_radius ] .",
    "we have imposed a cut at 1.6mpc in projected radius , beyond which our moving velocity dispersion begins to rise due to increasing velocity outliers .",
    "it is likely that some of the galaxies beyond this cut are also group members , however we are unable to reliably separate genuine group members from contaminant galaxies , and so beyond this radius we no longer include galaxies as group members .",
    "we note that the inclusion or exclusion of galaxies in this region has a negligible affect on the dynamical parameters we derive for the group ( i.e. mass , crossing time etc . ) .",
    "the member list for the ngc5044 group is shown in table [ group_gals ] and includes 111 galaxies , including 71 from fs90 , 16 from 6dfgs , 19 from ned and 5 from k08 . in fig .",
    "[ spatial ] we show the distribution of our confirmed group member galaxies on the sky , with symbols representing different morphological types .",
    "the group properties we find using velocity clipping rather than fof are consistent within uncertainties with those from b06 .",

    "are groups simply low - mass clusters , or do their member galaxies exhibit unique signs of formation and evolution ? in order to assess this we first need to establish the relation of the ngc5044 group to other groups and clusters .",

    ", we will briefly examine the reliability and consistency of these mass estimates .",
    "for this comparison we have built a sample of groups and clusters using two separate data sets .",
    "the first is the 15 southern gems groups studied by b06 , which contains groups in the range @xmath48 .",
    "b06 have calculated the dynamical properties of these groups ( i.e. virial mass , radius etc . ) and the x - ray properties of the groups have been presented by osmond & ponman ( 2004 ) .",
    "the second data set consists of 38 clusters from the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( asca ) cluster catalogue of horner ( 2001 ; acc ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion and virial mass measurements for these clusters have been adopted from girardi _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1998 ) , and only those clusters with @xmath4930 confirmed members are included in this analysis .    in order to compare the x - ray and dynamical masses for a number of sources ,",
    "we first need normalise them to a standard mass scale . for dynamical masses",
    "this normalisation is not straight forward .",
    "masses for the gems and acc samples are both calculated as virial masses , which implies a density contrast of @xmath50 for an @xmath51 universe ( bryan & norman 1998 ) .",
    "however there is no implicit radius assumption in these calculations , so scaling these masses to a different density contrast ( e.g. @xmath52 ) is difficult .",
    "we calculate x - ray masses to a similar density contrast as the dynamical estimates .",
    "this has been done using the @xmath53-model fit parameters to calculate the group mass in terms of density contrast and x - ray temperature ( horner , mushotzky & scharf 1999 ) such that    @xmath54    in this case , we adopt @xmath55 and use the @xmath53-model fits from osmond & ponman ( 2004 ) for the gems groups and fukazawa ( 1997 ) for the acc cluster sample .    in fig .",
    "[ dyn_tx_mass ] we show the comparison of dynamical masses and re - calculated x - ray masses .",

    "so , while the dynamical and x - ray masses for this group disagree , their disagreement is consistent with the systematic offset present between the two methods used .      in self - similar models of group and cluster",
    "formation the amount of gas present in a halo is directly related to the depth of the potential well , leading to correlations of x - ray luminosity with both gas temperature and velocity dispersion . in this self - similar model the x - ray luminosity scales directly with velocity dispersion as @xmath58 . at cluster masses",
    "there is general agreement that observations are consistent with the self - similar picture , with numerous studies finding power law slopes consistent with @xmath54 ( e.g. mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ; helsdon & ponman 2000a ; mahdavi & geller 2001 ; ortiz - gil _ et  al . _  2004",
    "; hilton _ et  al . _  2005 ) . at group masses",
    ", however , there is some disagreement as to whether or not the @xmath3@xmath4 relation is merely extension of the @xmath59 relation found for clusters , or shallows to a slope of @xmath52.4 ( e.g. helsdon & ponman 2000b ; xue & wu 2000 ) .",
    "osmond & ponman suggest that , rather than an actual flattening in the @xmath3@xmath4 relation , the observed break at group masses could be a result of @xmath4 poorly tracing the depth of the potential well .",
    "conversely , plionis & tovmassian ( 2004 ) argue that the observed flattening in the @xmath3@xmath4 relation at low velocity dispersions is spurious , and is only observed as a result of a statistical bias in sampling of the low-@xmath3 limit .",
    "theoretically , one can predict not only the @xmath3@xmath4 correlation , but also the relationship between total mass of a system and its x - ray temperature or luminosity . following self - similar arguments",
    "one can show that @xmath60 ( afshordi & cen 2002 ) and using @xmath61 , arrive at @xmath62 .",
    "as with the @xmath3@xmath4 relation , there is disagreement as to the consistency of observational data with self - similar predictions .",
    "horner , mushotzky & scharf ( 1999 ) find a slope for their cluster sample consistent with the predicted power law slope of @xmath51.5 in the @xmath63@xmath64 relation , while nevalainen _",
    "et  al . _  2000 and finoguenov ,",
    "reiprich & bhringer ( 2001 ) find suggestions of a steeper relation , owing to the inclusion of groups in their x - ray samples .",
    "this slope change can be attributed to either an increase in the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath63@xmath64 relation at group masses or a break in the relation where group and clusters follow fundamentally different trends .",
    "while it is outside the scope of this paper to examine the nature of the @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath3@xmath63 relations in detail , it is of interest to place the ngc5044 group in this parameter space relative to other groups and clusters .",

    "[ lx_sig ] and [ lx_mv ] we show the x - ray luminosity  velocity dispersion and dynamical mass relations for the combined gems and acc sample , with best fits to the gems , acc and combined samples overlayed .",
    "the ngc5044 group is fit well by both the cluster and combined sample fits in the @xmath3@xmath4 relation .",
    "while our fits suggest a difference in the group and cluster relations , the velocity dispersion measurements for low mass groups are highly uncertain ( owing to their low number of member galaxies ) .",
    "the fits we find for the @xmath3@xmath65 relation to the individual gems and acc samples are consistent with the idea of a shallowing slope at group masses . as in the @xmath3@xmath4 relation ,",
    "the ngc5044 group is better fit by the acc or combined sample trends .",
    "our results therefore suggest that , while the ngc5044 group s mass of @xmath66m@xmath2 places it between the group and cluster regimes , the relationship of its x - ray and dynamical properties show it to be more akin to clusters than groups .",
    "with numerous studies of the photometric properties of early - type galaxies , it has been established that brighter , more massive galaxies are increasingly redder in colour ( e.g. visvanathan & sandage 1977 ; baldry _ et  al . _  2004",

    "observed trends of increased metallicity towards high masses are consistent with feedback mechanisms , such as supernova driven winds that will be increasingly efficient at blowing gas out of low mass halos and suppressing star formation from enriched gas ( e.g. trager _",

    "thomas _ et  al . _",
    "the increased blue - ward scatter about the cmr at low masses is dominated by age effects ( gallazzi _ et  al .",

    "2005 ; blanton & berlind 2007 ) .",

    "et  al . _  ( 2003 ) , that above a certain local density ( in this case @xmath74galaxies mpc@xmath20 ) galaxies transition from blue and star - forming , to passively evolving and red .      with our large sample",
    "of confirmed 111 group members it is possible for us to explore the spatial and kinematic distribution of galaxies in significantly more detail than previous group studies .",
    "the most well known examples of spatial segregation , the morphology - density and morphology - radius relations ( e.g. dressler 1980 ; butcher & oemler 1984 ) have been well studied in galaxy clusters owing to the large numbers of galaxies typically available relative to the group environment .",
    "however studies focusing on galaxy groups also find significant evidence for segregation .",
    "in addition to spatial segregation , galaxies in clusters are found to be dynamically segregated with respect to both luminosity and morphology in simulations ( yepes _ et  al . _  1991",

    "we then compare the line - of - sight velocity distributions of sub - samples using two different methods to look for dynamically distinct behaviour .",
    "the first comparison is carried out using a ks test , which computes the likelihood of the two different samples being drawn from the same parent velocity distribution .",

    "<S> we use a combination of new aaomega multi - object wide - field spectroscopic observations and literature data to define 111 spectroscopically confirmed members of the massive ngc5044 group with @xmath0mag , providing a three - fold increase in group members over previous analyses of this group . </S>",
    "<S> we find the group to have a dynamical mass of 9.2@xmath1m@xmath2 , placing it on the border between rich groups and poor clusters . </S>",
    "<S> however , comparison to the @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath3mass relations shows it more closely follows cluster scaling relations . using a combination of crossing time , x - ray contours and line - of - sight velocity profile we are able to preclude growth of the ngc5044 group via major sub - group mergers within the last @xmath51gyr . while the majority of dynamical indicators for the group suggest it is virialized , we find evidence for a small , dynamically distinct sub - group at 1.4mpc from the group centre , suggesting that the ngc5044 group is the dominant structure in its local environment , and is currently accreting smaller groups .    </S>",
