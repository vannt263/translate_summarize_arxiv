    "maharam extension theorem extends in a natural way an invertible nonsingular conservative transformation of a @xmath1-finite standard measure space to an invertible conservative _ measure preserving _ transformation on an extended space , the so - called _ maharam skew product_. the result was established in @xcite ) and has been used in a number of ways , allowing , in particular , extensions of certain notions from the measure preserving case to the nonsingular case ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in this paper we generalize maharam s theorem to nonsingular @xmath0-actions .",
    "our approach is different than the one often used in the case @xmath2 , based on the fact that conservativity is equivalent to incompressibility .",
    "we use , instead , a result on the maximal value assigned by a group action over an increasing sequence of cubes to a nonnegatve function ( proposition [ pr : max ] below ) , which may be of an independent interest . in the proof of one of the statements in that proposition we use a recently established extension of krengel s theorem ( see @xcite ) on the structure of dissipative nonsingular transformations to nonsingular @xmath0-actions .",

    "the proof of theorem [ thm_maharam_extn ] presented in the next section relies on a result on the maximal value of a function transformed by the group of dual operators , given in proposition [ pr : max ] .",
    "the argument for one part of the proposition uses the following extension of krengel s theorem ( see @xcite ) on the structure of dissipative nonsingular maps to @xmath0-actions .",
