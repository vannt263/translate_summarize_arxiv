    "we use a phase - locked loop ( pll ) to control the sensor position , so that we can separately record the topography , frequency shift ( force gradient ) and the dissipation of the afm sensor .",
    "simultaneously , the complex transmission of the tuned filter circuit coupled to the afm tip is measured .",
    "this transmission is modulated by the sample properties as well as by the tip - sample capacitance .",
    "in contrast to the stray capacitance the latter is periodically modulated at the frequency of the sensor motion , which allows us to measure very small capacitance changes at high bandwidths .    in this paper",
    "we present the design of our dynamic scanning capacitance microscope ( dscm ) ( part ii ) and discuss the capacitance detection with the help of a quantitative lumped circuit harmonic oscillator model , where we introduce the tip - sample electrostatic interaction as a perturbation and show that the measured signals are in first order proportional to the complex tip - sample conductance ( part iii ) .",
