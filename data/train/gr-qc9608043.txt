    "one of the central results of the loop approach to quantum gravity @xcite is the derivation of discrete properties of spacetime geometry @xcite . this derivation realizes the old idea @xcite that spacetime might exhibit some kind of quantum discreteness at the planck scale @xcite .",
    "one of the manifestations of such discreteness is the fact that the operators associated to physical area and volume have discrete spectra  @xcite .",
    "this fact leads to the prediction that measurements of areas and volumes at the planck scale would yield quantized values @xcite .",
    "the explicit computation of the spectra of area and volume is thus a relevant step towards understanding the physics of the quantum gravitational field .",
    "partial results on these spectra , for instance , have already been employed in discussing quantum gravitational corrections of black hole radiation  @xcite and black hole entropy  @xcite .    here , we consider the area operator .",
    "a regularization technique for the definition of this operator was introduced in  @xcite , where some of the eigenvalues were computed .",
    "a more complete treatment was given in  @xcite , where the spectrum was computed in full except for a `` degenerate '' sector formed by the states in which vertices or edges of the spin network lie on the surface .",
    "it is difficult to treat this degenerate sector whose existence was pointed out by a ashtekar using the original regularization , because additional divergences appear . as a result ,",
    "earlier works on the calculation of geometry eigenvalues in the loop representation exhibit incomplete spectra for the area operator . in this paper",
    "we introduce an alternative regularization , whose action is well defined on every loop state .",
    "this is done in section  [ ii ] .",
    "this regularization allows us to compute the full spectrum of the area operator .",
    "the computation is performed in section  [ iii ] , using recoupling theory , which provides a powerful computation technique in quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "our calculation here is a further proof of the effectiveness of recoupling theory in this context .",
    "the complete spectrum of the area has been recently computed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the connection representation of quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum we obtain here fully agrees with the one given in ref .",
    "notice that the two representations are unitarily isomorphic , as argued by lewandowski @xcite , and , recently , by depietri @xcite , but the regularization techniques employed to define physical operators differ , so that the agreement is a non - trivial result .",

    "a direct change of variables @xmath19 leads to an expression which is not suitable for quantization , due to the the presence of products of operators at the same point .",

    "this can be done by selecting a sequence of quantities @xmath21 $ ] converging to ( [ clarea ] ) when @xmath22 goes to zero , each of which does not involve products of variables at the same point .",
    "the sequence can be quantized by substituting the dynamical variables with the corresponding quantum operators .",
    "the operator @xmath23 is then defined as a suitable operator limit of the resulting sequence of operators .",
    "there is a degree of arbitrariness in any regularization procedure ( in conventional field theory : dimensional regularization , point splitting , pauli - villar ... ) . in the present context ,",
    "the regularization procedure must satisfy two requirements .",
    "first , the classical regularized expression must converge to the correct classical quantity ( the area ) when the regulator is removed ; second , the quantum operator must be well defined in the limit and must respect the invariances of the theory ; in particular , the operator should transform correctly under diffeomorphisms .",
    "contrary to a possible impression that the choice of a regularization leaves great arbitrariness , implementing both requirements is actually far from trivial .",
    "the modification of the regularization procedure for the area operator considered in this paper is forced by the realization that the regularization considered in @xcite fails to satisfy the second viability criterion , if one relaxes the simplifying choice of neglecting certain states . in the following ,",
    "we construct one such regularization of the area operator .",
    "let us begin by introducing a smooth coordinate @xmath24 over a finite neighborhood of @xmath0 , in such a way that @xmath0 is given by @xmath25 .",

    "in order to have a one - parameter sequence , we now choose @xmath28 as a fixed function of @xmath22 . for technical reasons , the height of the block @xmath27 must decrease more rapidly than @xmath22 in the limit ; thus , we put @xmath31 with any @xmath32 greater than 1 and smaller than 2 .",
    "consider one of the blocks .",
    "the intersection of the block and a @xmath33 surface is a square surface : let @xmath34 be the area of such surface .",
    "let @xmath35 be the average over @xmath24 of the areas of the surfaces in the block .",
    "namely @xmath36 summing over the blocks yields the average of the areas of the @xmath37 surfaces , and as @xmath22 ( and therefore @xmath28 ) approaches zero , the sum converges to the area of the surface @xmath0 .",
