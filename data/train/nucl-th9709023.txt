    "there are two reasons of interest for determining the @xmath0 coupling constants : the existence of definite predictions for the @xmath3 couplings by flavour su(3 ) symmetry @xcite , and the forthcoming opening of da@xmath4ne @xcite that will create conditions which should improve the experimental knowledge of the s =  1 meson  nucleon interaction .",
    "the current knowledge of @xmath3 couplings is that @xmath5 is known within a few percent from @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 scattering @xcite .",
    "the two @xmath9 couplings are known with less , but still reasonable , accuracy from @xmath10 dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "a few papers can also be found dealing with the determination of @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite couplings , whereas for the @xmath13 coupling real attempts at its determination have been even scarcer .",
    "processes like @xmath14 and @xmath15 elastic scattering , or @xmath16 , are not accessible to experiment : however , parametrizations for their amplitudes are provided as a byproduct of the coupled  channel k or m  matrix formalism employed to analyse @xmath2 interactions . in its simplest form ,",
    "this formalism considers two  body channels only , and , when used in the kinematical region between the @xmath17 threshold and an energy just above the @xmath18(1520 ) d  wave resonance , it has allowed to determine , by analytic continuation , the @xmath2 elastic amplitudes in the unphysical regions between the @xmath14 ( for the i = 1 channel ) or @xmath15 ( for the i = 0 one ) thresholds and the elastic one , describing as well the amplitudes for all the other channels in a framework that guarantees unitarity .",
    "of course , @xmath2 reactions can only provide information on the i = 0 , 1 channels , so that the i = 2 @xmath15 amplitude remains unknown .",
    "we use the amplitudes obtained in this way to calculate the @xmath0 couplings by conventional dispersion relations @xcite applied to three reactions , namely elastic @xmath14 and @xmath15 scattering and @xmath16 : for the first two cases dispersive calculations may already be found in the literature , whereas the third amplitude is discussed here for the first time in this context . in a second paper presented at this symposium , more sophisticated techniques , also based on analyticity , will be reported @xcite .",
    "our purposes are , first , to update the results of refs .",
    "[ 5,6 ] , making use of updated inputs in various energy ranges of the dispersive integrals ; second , to analyse the stability of the results against variations of the energy @xmath19 at which the drs are evaluated , whereas all previous works used drs at just a single energy : this , together with the stability against the use of different dispersive techniques , constitutes a test of the goodness of the k or m  matrix elements for the physically unfeasible @xmath20 reactions .",
    "last but not least , we wish to analyse the behaviour of the contributions to the couplings from each partial wave , in order to understand whether suitable experiments at da@xmath4ne might improve our knowledge on the @xmath20 amplitudes .",
    "it has to be remembered that the experiments used in the past to determine the k or m  matrix elements were performed with statistics much lower than those attainable at da@xmath4ne , and that this machine will be able to explore in detail the very - low energy region around the @xmath21 charge - exchange threshold , where energy ",
    "dependent effects due to the @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath21 mass difference are expected to show up .",
    "this strategy has proved to be useful , since we shall show that the values of the coupling constants exhibit a variation with energy in the region studied , and shall also point to the partial wave(s ) presumably responsible for this behaviour .",
    "the following part of this paper will describe the methodology of our work , including the selection of inputs made to evaluate the drs , the third part will discuss each one of the processes ( namely elastic @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) , and , finally , we shall present some comments on our results .",
    "standard drs allow to evaluate the coupling constants as sum of two terms , proportional , respectively , to the real part of the amplitude evaluated at a suitable energy @xmath19 and to the dispersive integral , which ranges from the lowest threshold ( with the same quantum numbers as the process considered ) to infinity .",
    "it is convenient to separate the contributions to the integrals into three energy regions : low , intermediate and high .",
    "the choices of the dr , of the @xmath19 value , and of the amplitudes to which to apply the dr , depend on the quality of the inputs at different energies .",
    "we use the fastest  converging dispersion relations , in order to reduce the uncertainty coming from the high  energy region , since in our case the most reliable inputs should be those provided by the low  energy k or m  matrix analyses . the integrals in the energy range above those considered by these latter",
    "have been estimated using resonance couplings at intermediate energies and a regge  pole model at the highest ones , and matching the two through two  component duality @xcite . in the absence of a point at which a subtraction could be done without extra theoretical inputs , such as e.g. the adler consistency condition @xcite",
    ", the best alternative turns out to be the use of unsubtracted drs .",
    "the criteria just expressed for the dr lead to choose amplitudes which have the fastest  decreasing behaviour as @xmath22 : in terms of the invariant amplitudes @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 being the amplitude whose imaginary part in the forward direction is given by the optical theorem as @xmath27 ) , we use @xmath28 for the elastic @xmath14 and @xmath15 scattering , and @xmath29 for the inelastic process @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are dominated by the s  wave , while @xmath32 by the p  waves : since some of the k  matrix analyses @xcite are purely s  wave , and the existence of the @xmath33(1385 ) requires at least inclusion of the p@xmath34 one as well , a calculation using such parametrizations would be useless for @xmath32 , whereas for @xmath30 and @xmath31 would lead to determine an `` effective coupling '' for both the @xmath33 and the @xmath33(1385 ) .    due to the absence of information on the i = 2 @xmath15 amplitude , in the elastic @xmath15",
    "dr we are forced to use the crossing - even combination of isospin amplitudes @xmath35 , which is the only one free of the i = 2 part both in the @xmath36 and @xmath37 channel : an identical choice was made in the earlier applications of dr to this process @xcite",
    ".    for the low  energy region there exist two _ published _",
    "k or m  matrix parametrizations extending down to the @xmath2 threshold and including s , p and d ",
    "waves @xcite .",
    "the second , which includes also f  waves , is a fit amalgamating different analyses , but it does not show the @xmath18(1405 ) and @xmath33(1385 ) features below the @xmath2 threshold : this leaves kim s parametrization @xcite as the only viable choice for our calculations .",
    "kim s analysis covers the region from threshold to 550 mev / c , and expresses the t matrix as @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the momentum matrix in the c.m .",
    "frame and @xmath40 its value at the @xmath2 threshold , the m ",
    "matrix is expressed in the effective  range approximation , @xmath41 is the angular momentum , @xmath42 the diagonal effective  range matrix and @xmath43 an appropriate coefficient .",
    "this analysis gives a good description of s and p@xmath34 waves , whose energy dependence includes the first and second coefficient of the effective range expansion , whereas that of p@xmath44 , p@xmath45 and p@xmath46 waves is poor , since their energy dependences include only the first coefficient : the development in powers of @xmath47 being not the same for all waves , the fact that this might be the source of some internal inconsistency has been noticed in ref .",
    "[ 18 ] .    in the intermediate",
    " energy region ( 550 mev / c to 2,000 mev / c ) , we saturate the integrals by resonances in a narrow  width approximation , using the parametres of ref .",
    "[ 19 ] : we have preferred this to the pdg compilation in order to have a self  consistent analysis in the whole region .",
    "the resonance contribution is not unambiguous @xcite , and it can also be noticed that the @xmath18 and @xmath33 resonances actually observed are about one  half the number expected on the basis of su(6 ) and of the known @xmath48 s and @xmath49 s : however , the total contribution from this region is small , so that these uncertainties are not very relevant in our calculation .    in the intermediate and high  energy regions ,",
    "the background contributions for @xmath14 and @xmath15 elastic scattering are calculated from pomeron exchange , assuming a multi  component model to account for the deviation of the asymptotic ratios @xmath50 and @xmath51 from 1 and 1.5 respectively . the only attempt to evaluate regge ",
    "pole couplings for @xmath20 scattering was made only for the pomeron coupling to @xmath14 using fesrs @xcite : for a more complete description of the asymptotic region we extend the regge  pole fit by donnachie and landshoff @xcite to all @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 data above @xmath36 = 6 gev@xmath52 , using for the reggeon couplings flavour su(3 ) symmetry and the okubo  zweig rule , and assuming their parametrization @xcite to extend to energies much lower than those where it was fit to the data : we thus obtain @xmath53 = 12.42 mb @xmath54 + 25.13 mb ( 17.25 mb ) @xmath55 ( with @xmath56 = 1 gev ) . working with @xmath32 , rather than with @xmath31 as in the fit by ref . [ 21 ] , we then resort to the approximate relation @xmath57 , valid only for the dominant asymptotic terms in an optical model .",
    "the process @xmath58 is pure i = 1 , with just one born term in the dr , whose pole at @xmath59 = 0 lies at @xmath60 = 71.35 mev , well below the threshold @xmath61 .",
    "the contributions to the unsubtracted dr for @xmath62 can be rated according to their magnitude , being small those from the low - energy s  wave , regge poles , the pomeron and intermediate  energy resonances , leaving as the most important ones those from the low  energy p@xmath45 and p@xmath34 waves .",
    "it is important to notice that the main contribution to the coupling constant comes from the poorly known p@xmath45 wave ( fig .",
    "1.a ) : indeed , the huge variation with energy of @xmath63 reflects the similar behaviour of this contribution .",
    "although this kind of calculation can only be performed using parametrizations which include p  waves , this result casts doubts on the reliability of kim s one @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that , if the contribution from the p@xmath45 wave is subtracted , the sum of the remaining contributions to @xmath64 remains almost constant in a wide energy interval .",
    "table 1 shows the values obtained in different works ; our results are presented both with all contributions ( a ) , and having subtracted the p@xmath45 one ( b ) .    for the process",
    "@xmath65 there are two born terms , one for the @xmath18 and one for the @xmath33 .",
    "the dr for this process exhibit a peculiarity with respect to other elastic meson  nucleon drs , since the @xmath18 pole falls on the cut between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 thresholds .",
    "thus we can not expect the m  matrix to describe correctly the real part of the amplitude close to the @xmath18 pole where , however , the imaginary part of the amplitude is not affected by this fact . at energies away from the position of the @xmath18 pole one",
    "expects a smooth behaviour of both the real and imaginary parts , so that the dr can be safely evaluated there , except near the cutoff just above 1,600 mev , where effects of the poor matching with the resonance saturation region appear .",
    "if we use as additional input in the @xmath15 dr the value of @xmath63 obtained from the @xmath14 one , we find again a strong variation with energy of @xmath66 as well . also this variation can be attributed to p  waves effects , since subtraction of the contributions from p@xmath44 and p@xmath45 waves eliminates this structure ( fig .",
    "1.b ) ; again table 1 presents the values obtained in different works for @xmath67 , together with our results both with and without the j = @xmath68 p  waves .",
    "* table 1 *    @xmath69 from @xmath58 and @xmath67 from @xmath65    [ cols= \" > , > , < \" , ]     for the reaction @xmath16 , which is a pure i = 1 process , and whose amplitudes have the same analytical structure as the elastic @xmath14 ones , we use the crossing - even superconvergent amplitude @xmath70 : of course in this case the born term is proportional to the product of the two @xmath0 coupling constants .    the results which include the contributions from all partial waves are not consistent with the previous two calculations ( fig .",
    "1.c ) : the product @xmath71 exhibits a variation from positive to negative values in the region around the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "looking at the contributions from the different partial waves , one again sees that the contribution responsible for the change of sign is that from p@xmath45 , and that the dominant ones are s and p  waves , whereas intermediate  energy resonances and regge  poles are negligible .",
    "there is a clear inconsistency between a near  zero value for the product at the @xmath2 threshold and the values of the coupling constants obtained from elastic @xmath20 scattering at the same c.m .",
    "however , the value corresponding to subtraction of the p@xmath45 wave , @xmath72 5.0 at @xmath73 , is very close to the values obtained for both @xmath74 and @xmath75 from elastic @xmath20 drs ignoring the contributions from p@xmath44 and p@xmath45 waves .",
    "this seems to suggests that j = @xmath68 p  waves are poorly determined in kim s analysis , or at least that their @xmath20 matrix elements are .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that even if @xmath31 is commonly assumed to be dominated by the s  wave , the importance of the p  waves contributions in the present case should lead to question any result based on a pure  s  wave parametrization .",
    "dr calculations of @xmath0 couplings indicate that current @xmath2 low  energy analyses do not adequately determine all p  waves for the coupled @xmath20 channels .",
    "this does not allow to determine the @xmath76 coupling constants with the accuracy claimed by previous calculations .",
    "if the j = @xmath68 p  wave contributions were much overestimated , then it would still be possible for these couplings to agree with each other and with su(3)symmetry predictions .",
    "this work suggests also to explore whether the @xmath2 matrix elements suffer from the same problem : in fact , an analogous study for @xmath2 scattering @xcite found , working with once  subtracted drs for the @xmath31 amplitudes , an energy dependence of the coupling @xmath77 with a slope @xmath78 30 gev@xmath79 at the @xmath2 threshold , an effect which perhaps , on the basis of what said above , should have been attributed to the inadequacy of kim s `` small '' p@xmath44 and p@xmath45 waves .",
    "the above results have shown that the low  energy s =  1 meson  nucleon sector is less well known than currently believed , and that it deserves more accurate experiments and analyses if one wants to reach for its knowledge a level comparable to that of the @xmath6 one .",
