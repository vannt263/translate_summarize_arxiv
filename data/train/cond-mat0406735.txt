    "in the past decade , the study of systems of two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in semiconductors@xcite has been extended by the application of spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field can be realized experimentally either by varying the topography of the electron gas  @xcite , by using ferromagnetic materials  @xcite , depositing a superconductor on top of the 2deg  @xcite .",
    "numerous theoretical works also show an increasing interest in the study of electron motion in inhomogeneous magnetic field ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .    in the experimental works mentioned above , for gaas heterostructures , on the one hand ,",
    "the electron dynamics is confined to two - dimensions . on the other hand , the coherence length and",
    "the mean free path of the electron can be much larger than the size of the system , while the fermi wavelength is comparable to the size of the 2deg .",
    "moreover , the electron system can be described to a good approximation as a free electron gas with an effective mass@xcite .",
    "therefore , the quantum mechanical treatment of these systems is of some physical interest .    in this paper , as an example , we consider the energy levels of a two - dimensional non - interacting electron gas in a magnetic field that is zero inside a circular region and constant outside . this system ( shown in fig .",
    "[ geo_bantidot : fig ] ) will be called a magnetic anti - dot ; it was first studied by solimany and kramer  @xcite . solving the schrdinger equation",
    "it was shown that there are bound states . introducing an effective angular momentum , the schrdinger equation of the particle in symmetric gauge",
    "can be mapped to the landau model .",
    "this effective angular momentum is a sum of the angular momentum in a uniform magnetic field and the flux ( in units of the flux quantum ) missing from the uniform field .",
    "recently , sim et al .",
    "@xcite have renewed the study of this system and pointed out the crucial role of the magnetic edge states in the magnetoconductance .",
    "the classical counterparts of these states correspond to trajectories of the charged particle that consist of straight segments inside the non - magnetic region and arcs outside .     and constant outside the circle .",
    "[ geo_bantidot : fig ] ]    although it is difficult to measure directly the density of states of a quantum system , it affects many observable quantities such as the magnetoconductance , the magnetization or the susceptibility . in the interpretation of the experimental results the semiclassical approximation proved to be a useful tool .",
    "several semiclassical approaches  @xcite are known in the literature and an excellent overview of the subject can be found in the textbook by brack and bhaduri@xcite .",
    "different semiclassical theories for magnetic systems have successfully been applied , for example , in works  @xcite . for integrable systems",
    "berry and tabor  @xcite have shown that the oscillating part of the density of states can always be expressed in terms of classical periodic orbits .",
    "this formula is commonly called the berry - tabor trace formula .",
    "one of our aims in this paper is to apply , for the first time , the berry - tabor trace formula for a magnetic anti - dot . to illustrate the power of the method",
    ", we also calculate the exact eigenvalues of the single particle schrdinger equation and find a very good agreement between the two results .",
    "we should mention here that the statement by sim et al .",
    "@xcite on the relation between the quantum states and the corresponding periodic orbits is somewhat misleading .",
    "their condition for a given periodic orbit is not necessarily satisfied at the value of the corresponding exact energy level as they claimed however , including more and more periodic orbits with the proper weights in the trace formula the sum converges to the correct quantum density of states . in practice only a few of the shortest orbits",
    "are enough to get a rough estimate of the positions of the exact energy levels .",
    "the power of the semiclassical approach can also be demonstrated by applying the bohr - sommerfeld approximation .",
    "we shall show that the energy levels obtained from the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rules also agree very well with the numerically exact levels even for the lowest eigenstates .",
    "note that in this semiclassical treatment the quantization should be applied to the classical motion on a two - dimensional torus parametrized by the action variables and their canonically conjugate angle variables ( for details see , eg , ref .  ) .",
    "the classical orbits can be classified by their cyclotron radius @xmath0 and their guiding center @xmath1 ( distance of the center of the orbits from the origin ) . in the quantum mechanical treatment",
    "one can calculate the average of operators defining the cyclotron radius and the guiding center . for circular magnetic billiards ,",
    "lent  @xcite has derived approximate expressions for these averages for a given quantum state . following ref .",
    ", one may derive the corresponding relations for magnetic anti - dot systems .",
    "thus , these relations are the basis for classifying the different quantum states in terms of classical orbits for our system",
    ". we will show that the quantum states can be described by six different types of classical orbits .",
    "in addition , this classification enables us to draw a so - called ` phase diagram ' which shows a clear one - to - one correspondence between classical orbits and quantum states .    to complete our semiclassical study , we finally present results for the probability current density calculated from quantum calculations .",
    "we shall argue that the current flow patterns can be understood qualitatively from the corresponding classical trajectories .",
    "recently , halperin  @xcite has been shown that the total current ( the integral of the current density along the radial direction ) can be related to the dispersion of the energy levels ( their angular momentum dependence ) . as it will be shown this general relation works in our magnetic anti - dot system , too .    regarding the numerical calculations",
    ", we should mention that the semiclassical approach presented in this paper proves to be a very effective method .",
    "moreover , it provides a better understanding of the nature of the quantum system .",
    "our semiclassical method applied to magnetic anti - dot systems may be an important tool to understand the role of the magnetic edge states in the density of states or the magnetization ( both are experimentally accessible physical qauntities ) .",
    "we believe that our semiclassical analysis can be extended to other types of inhomogeneous magnetic fields such as studied , eg , in refs .   as well as non - circular dot systems .",

    ", the density of states was calculated using the berry - tabor formula . on the other hand , the energy levels obtained from the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rules .",
    "the main difference between the two methods is that in the first case one needs to characterize the possible periodic orbits in real space , while in the latter , the motion of the particle is on a torus in the space of the action variables . in our numerical results we compared the quantum energy spectrum and that obtained in the semiclassical approach .",
    "we showed that the energy levels of the magnetic anti - dot systems obtained from the two semiclassical methods were in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum results for weak magnetic fields .",
    "however , by increasing the magnetic field , a slight deviation between the exact and the semiclassically approximated energy levels can be observed .",
    "we argued that the reason for this discrepancy may be traced back to the fact that the maslov index should be magnetic field dependent .",
    "a thorough investigation of this problem might be an interesting future work .",
    "a classification of the energy spectrum for arbitrary magnetic fields was presented in terms of the classical orbits defined by their cyclotron radius and guiding center .",
    "such identifications are based on the explicit relations between these classical parameters of the orbits and the quantum states .",
    "the correspondence between the quantum states and the classical trajectories can be made transparent by drawing a phase diagram with regions corresponding to six different types of orbits in the space of energy and angular momentum quantum number .    finally , we calculated the current flow patterns for eigenstates that correspond to orbits with trajectories penetrating into the field - free region .",
    "the related classical trajectories were also shown for the sake of comparisson . from these results",
    "one can see the close correspondence between the structure of the trajectories and the distribution of the current densities obtained from the quantum calculations .    from the energy spectrum of the magnetic anti - dot systems one can determine the free energy .",
    "the good agreement between the semiclassical and quantum treatment of the system allows us to use semiclassical methods in the weak field limit for calculating the energy spectrum .",
    "therefore , the semiclassical approach provides a useful starting point for successive studies of thermodynamic properties , such as magnetization .",
    "moreover , the semiclassical approximation can be an effective tool for investigating arbitrarily shaped magnetic anti - dots ( which would be a very difficult task in the quantum case ) or systems with more complicated magnetic field profiles .",
    "we would like to thank b. kramer , a. nogaret and a. pirth for useful discussions .",

    "the quantized energies can be recovered if we express the hamiltonian in terms of @xmath48 @xmath142 the semiclassical density of states is the density of these energies : @xmath143 the density of states can be rewritten via the poisson resummation technique @xmath144 here , we used the fourier expansion of the delta spike train .",
    "the term @xmath145 can be evaluated directly and yields the non - oscillatory average density of states .",
    "other terms can be evaluated by the saddle point method , when @xmath146 .",
    "the saddlepoint conditions select the periodic orbits of the system , and the result of the integration is @xmath147 here @xmath55 is the index of the primitive periodic orbits , @xmath56 is the number of repetitions , @xmath148 is the classical action along the orbit , @xmath149 is the time period of the orbit , and @xmath58 is the maslov index .",
    "the quantity @xmath150 is the number of action variables of the periodic orbit whose saddle point value is zero @xmath151 , since in this case the gaussian saddle point integral is only one - sided , and its contribution is @xmath152 of the full gaussian integral .",

    "very often the hamiltonian can not be expressed with the action variables explicitly , only the implicit function @xmath156 is available . in this case",
    "it is more useful to express the quantities in the berry - tabor trace formula in terms of the derivatives of @xmath157 . taking the partial derivative of ( [ gi ] ) with respect to @xmath62 yields @xmath158 while the partial derivative of ( [ gi ] ) with respect to @xmath60 gives @xmath159 the frequencies",

    "the action @xmath62 for a periodic orbit at energy @xmath13 can be obtained by solving equation @xmath163 where we introduced @xmath164 and @xmath165 corresponding to the primitive orbit .",
    "then the period can be expressed simply as @xmath166    the main determinant to be calculated reads @xmath167 now , the second derivatives of @xmath168 can be expressed with the second derivatives of @xmath157 by taking further partial derivatives of ( [ gi1 ] ) and ( [ gi2 ] ) with respect to @xmath62 and @xmath60 .",
    "then we can express the second derivatives as @xmath169 using these expressions , the determinant becomes @xmath170    the density of states in two dimensions is then @xmath171",
    "the cyclotron radius can be determined from the energy @xmath13 of the particle .",
    "the energy is conserved , and obviously @xmath172 , thus @xmath173    the guiding center may be calculated as follows . as we have seen , the conjugate momentum given by eq .",
    "( [ pfi_phi_dot : eq ] ) is a constant of motion , therefore , e.g. , for @xmath33 the right hand side of ( [ pfi_phi_dot : eq ] ) should also be a constant at any point of the orbit .",

    "then the distances of points @xmath174 and @xmath175 from the origin are @xmath176 and @xmath177 ( we assume that point @xmath175 is farther from the origin ) . from a simple geometrical argument one finds that the angular velocity at points @xmath174 and @xmath175 satisfies the following equations @xmath178 substituting , for example , @xmath176 and @xmath179 from ( [ r_p_app : eq ] ) into eq .",
