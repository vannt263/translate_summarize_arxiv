    "<S> the structure of the energy spectra remains very similar , which indicates that the spin interaction @xmath6 term may only enhance the energy scale of excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the gapped sl @xcite may exist neighboring with the critical sl close to the nn heisenberg model and we can not determine the precise phase boundary of the critical sl due to the limited system width we can access in dmrg simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> _ summary and discussions. _ we identify a trs broken csl phase with a small pertubation @xmath113 in the @xmath114 xy model , while the nn xy model is in a critical phase adjacent to the csl with vanishing singlet excitations and a small or vanishing spin triplet gap based on ed and dmrg studies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by studying the evolution of es crossing the quantum phase transition , we identify that the quantum phase transition takes place through the coupling and mixing of the chiral states with opposite chiralities , which naturally lead to a critical state with trs and gapless neutral excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum phase transition appears to be very smooth , which is driven by the continuous closing of the gap for spin singlet excitations . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is important to mention that limited by the range of systems one can access using dmrg , one can not determine if there is a discontinuity in the singlet gap at the transition point in thermodynamic limit . thus the quantum phase transition can be a weakly first order or continuous transition , which demands study based on effective theory for these novel sl states . finally , we find that the nn @xmath6 coupling leads to a phase diagram with an extended regime for the critical sl possibly including or close to the nn heisenberg kagome model . while the neutral excitation has to be gapless in such a critical sl , we find that the spin gap is possibly finite , but very small , which grows bigger with the increase of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> our dmrg calculations for spin gap on larger tori and ed calculations for singlet gap indicate that these gaps decrease towards the nn models with reducing @xmath83 , which are more consistent with a critical sl . </S>",
    "<S> however , the gapped @xmath8 sl @xcite may develop on larger systems in the nn models through opening the vison gap from the gapless neutral excitations outside the critical sl . </S>",
    "<S> this open and challenging question is desired to be addressed in the future based on different numerical methods and effective field theory approaches .    </S>",
