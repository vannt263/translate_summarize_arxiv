    "suppose that @xmath0 is a separable topological vector space and @xmath1 is a continuous linear mapping on @xmath0 . if @xmath2 , then the orbit of @xmath3 under @xmath1 is defined as @xmath4 .",
    "an operator @xmath1 is called hypercyclic if there is a vector @xmath3 such that @xmath5 is dense in @xmath0 and in this case @xmath3 is called a hypercyclic vector for @xmath1 ( see @xcite for an exhaustive survey on hypercyclicity ) .",
    "it is interesting that many continuous linear mappings can actually be hypercyclic .",
    "the first example of hypercyclicity appeared in the space of entire functions , by birkhoff @xcite in 1929 .",
    "he showed the hypercyclicity of the translation operator , while maclane @xcite proved the hypercyclicity of the differentiation operator in 1952 .",
    "hypercyclicity on banach spaces was discussed in 1969 by rolewics @xcite , who showed that @xmath6 is hypercyclic whenever @xmath7 is the unilateral backward shift ( on @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 .",
    "a nice condition for hypercyclicity is the hypercyclicity criterion ( theorem  1.1 below ) , which was developed by kitai @xcite and independently by gethner and shapiro @xcite .",
    "this criterion has been used to show that certain classes of composition operators @xcite , weighted shifts @xcite , adjoints of multiplication operators @xcite , and adjoints of subnormal and hyponormal operators @xcite , are hypercyclic .",
    "hypercyclicity has also been established in various other settings by means of this criterion @xcite .",
    "salas @xcite showed that every perturbation of the identity by a unilateral weighted backward shift with nonzero bounded weights is hypercyclic , and he also gave a characterization of the hypercyclic weighted shifts in terms of their weights .",
    "but , then montes and leon showed that these hypercyclic operators do satisfy the criterion as well (  2 of @xcite and proposition  4.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "bes and peris proved that a continuous linear operator @xmath1 on a frechet space satisfies the hypercyclicity criterion if and only if it is hereditarily hypercyclic .",
    "in particular they show that hypercyclic operators with either a dense generalized kernel or a dense set of periodic points must satisfy the criterion .",
    "also , they provide a characterization of those weighted shifts @xmath1 that are hereditarily hypercyclic with respect to a given sequence @xmath11 of positive integers , as well as conditions under which @xmath1 and @xmath12 share the same set of hypercyclic vectors @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a separable banach space and @xmath1 is a continuous linear mapping on @xmath0 .",
    "if there exists two dense subsets @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xmath0 and a sequence @xmath15 such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath16 for every @xmath17 , 2",
    ".   there exists functions @xmath18 such that for every @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ,    then @xmath1 is hypercyclic .",
    "note that the sequence @xmath15 in theorem  1.1 need not be the entire sequence @xmath21 of positive integers .",
    "salas @xcite and herrero @xcite have shown that there are hypercyclic operators on hilbert spaces that do not satisfy the hypercyclicity criterion for the entire sequence @xmath22 , but so far no hypercyclic operator has been found that does not satisfy the hypercyclicity criterion in its general form . in this paper our work was stimulated by the well - known question : does every hypercyclic operator satisfy the hypothesis of the hypercyclicity criterion ?",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "we give necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of open subsets for an operator on a separable hilbert space to satisfy the hypercyclicity criterion .",
    "for this , see theorem  2.6 , corollary  2.11 and proposition  2.12 .",
    "also , in the proof of theorem  2.6 , we pay attention to hypercyclicity on the operator algebra @xmath23 and the algebra of hilbert  schmidt operators , @xmath24 . recall that if @xmath25 is an orthonormal basis for a separable hilbert space @xmath26 and @xmath27^{1/2},\\ ] ] then @xmath28 is independent of the basis chosen and hence is well - defined .",
    "if @xmath29 , then @xmath30 is called a hilbert  schmidt operator and by this norm @xmath24 is a hilbert space . indeed , @xmath31 is a special case of the schatten @xmath32-class of @xmath33 when @xmath34 . for more details about these classes of operators ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "chan @xcite showed that hypercyclicity can occur on the operator algebra @xmath23 with the strong operator topology ( sot - topology ) that is not metrizable .",
    "for example , when @xmath1 satisfies the hypercyclicity criterion , then the left multiplication operator @xmath35 is sot - hypercyclic on @xmath23 , that is , @xmath35 is hypercyclic on @xmath23 with strong operator topology .",
    "from now on we suppose that @xmath33 is a separable infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "@xmath36    let @xmath37 be linear and bounded .",
    "we say that @xmath38 is sot - hypercyclic if there exist some @xmath39 such that the set @xmath40 is dense in @xmath23 in the strong operator topology .",

    "@xmath36    for any operator @xmath39 , define the left multiplication operator @xmath45 by @xmath46 for every @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath24 is an ideal of @xmath23 and hence @xmath48 is also well - defined .",
    "we show that @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively with the strong operator topology and @xmath42-topology , are separable . for this , see the following lemma  2.3 .",
    "suppose @xmath49 is an orthonormal basis for a separable hilbert space @xmath33 and @xmath50 denotes the set of all finite rank operators @xmath1 such that there exists @xmath51 , satisfying @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "suppose @xmath54 is a basis for a separable hilbert space @xmath33 , then @xmath50 is sot - dense in @xmath23 and also @xmath42-dense in @xmath24 ; moreover , @xmath50 isseparable .",

    "now the proof is complete.@xmath67    the following result is the main tool that we used to show that an operator is hypercyclic .",

    "it is easy to see that ( i ) implies ( ii ) ( for details see corollary  1.4 in @xcite ) . for the converse , assume that @xmath1 satisfies property ( ii ) .",
    "first we show that for each pair @xmath87 of non - void @xmath42-open subsets of @xmath24 there is an integer @xmath88 such that @xmath89 . for this ,",
    "fix an orthonormal basis @xmath90 for @xmath33 . by using lemma  2.3 there exist finite rank operators @xmath30 and @xmath7 such that @xmath91 and @xmath92 , whence for a certain integer @xmath93 we have @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "but for some @xmath56 we have @xmath96 and @xmath97 now consider the following open sets : @xmath98    @xmath36    for @xmath99 .",
    "note that corollary  2.5 or remark ( iii ) implies that @xmath1 is hypercyclic .",
    "now by using proposition  2.4 repeatedly ( indeed by remark ( ii ) ) , it follows that there exist integers @xmath100 and @xmath101 such that @xmath102 and @xmath103 put @xmath104 where @xmath105 since @xmath1 satisfies the hypothesis ( ii ) of theorem  2.6 , then there exists some @xmath106 and @xmath107 such that @xmath108 and @xmath109 for some integer @xmath71 .",

    "also note that since @xmath118 , by ( 3 ) we get @xmath119 , and thus we have @xmath120 & = \\left\\ { \\sum^{n}_{i=1 } \\|t^{n } s_{2 } e_{i } - be_{i } \\|^{2}\\right\\}^{1/2 } + \\left\\ { \\sum^{n}_{i=1 } \\|t^{n } s_{1 } e_{i}\\|^{2 } \\right\\}^{1/2}\\\\[.4pc ] & = \\left\\ { \\sum^{n}_{i=1 } \\|t^{n}(t^{m_{i-1 } } x ) - be_{i}\\|^{2}\\right\\}^{1/2}\\\\[.4pc ] & \\quad\\ , + \\left\\ { \\sum^{n}_{i=1 } \\|t^{n_{i-1 } } ( t^{n } y)\\|^{2}\\right\\}^{1/2 } < \\varepsilon.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so @xmath121 .",
    "now it follows that @xmath122 and so by proposition  2.4 , @xmath35 is @xmath123-hypercyclic .",
    "this also implies that @xmath124 is hypercyclic , because the left multiplication operator @xmath125 is unitary equivalent to the operator @xmath124 ( see @xcite , p.  6 ) .",

    "thus , hypothesis ( ii ) of theorem  2.6 holds and so the proof is complete.@xmath67    we say that the sequence @xmath139 of bounded linear operators on a hilbert space @xmath33 is hypercyclic provided that there exists some @xmath140 such that the collection of images @xmath141 is dense in @xmath33 .",
    "note that theorem  1.1 , proposition  2.4 and corollary  2.5 can be extended to the case where hypercyclicity of @xmath1 is replaced by hypercyclicity for the sequence @xmath142 of bounded linear operators that have dense range .",
    "in particular we say that @xmath142 satisfies the hypothesis of the hypercyclicity criterion if in the hypothesis of theorem  1.1 , we use @xmath143 instead of @xmath144 .",
