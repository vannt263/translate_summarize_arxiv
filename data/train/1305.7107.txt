    "the predicted properties of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians @xcite have been observed at the classical level in a wide variety of laboratory experiments involving superconductivity @xcite , optics @xcite , microwave cavities @xcite , atomic diffusion @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , and coupled electronic and mechanical oscillators @xcite .",
    "although @xmath0-symmetric systems were originally explored at a highly mathematical level , it is now understood that one can interpret @xmath0-symmetric systems simply as nonisolated physical systems having a balanced loss and gain .    in this paper",
    "we examine a mathematical model based on recent unpublished experiments .",
    "these experiments were performed on a system consisting of two coupled @xmath0-symmetric whispering galleries ( optical resonators ) @xcite .",
    "such a system is @xmath0 symmetric if one resonator is optically driven and the other resonator has a balanced loss .",
    "we examine here the properties of the mathematical model at a theoretical level and we study both the classical and the quantum versions of the system .    a system of two identical coupled resonators , one with loss and the other with gain , can be modeled as coupled oscillators whose amplitudes are @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "both oscillators have a natural frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the first oscillator @xmath5 is subject to a friction force @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , while the second oscillator @xmath8 is subject to an antifriction force @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 are a measure of the loss and gain .",
    "the oscillators are coupled linearly and the coupling strength is represented by the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the equations of motion of these oscillators are @xmath13    to treat this system at a classical level , we seek solutions to ( [ e1 ] ) of the form @xmath14 .",
    "the frequency @xmath15 satisfies the quartic polynomial equation @xmath16    an important special case arises when the loss and gain are balanced ; that is , when @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the frequencies @xmath15 are the roots of the quartic polynomial @xmath18 , where @xmath19 for this special case the classical equations of motion ( [ e1 ] ) can be derived from the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath20    if the coupling parameter @xmath1 of the @xmath5 and @xmath8 oscillators is set to zero , this hamiltonian reduces to the hamiltonian considered by bateman @xcite . in his paper bateman sought a variational principle to derive an equation of motion having a friction term linear in velocity . to do so",
    ", he introduced an additional degree of freedom ; namely , a time - reversed version of the original damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "this auxiliary oscillator acts as an energy reservoir and can be considered as an effective description of a thermal bath .",
    "the classical hamiltonian for the bateman system was constructed by morse and feschbach @xcite and the corresponding quantum theory was analyzed by many authors , including bopp @xcite , feshbach and tikochinsky @xcite , tikochinsky @xcite , dekker @xcite , celeghini , rasetti , and vitiello @xcite , banerjee and mukherjee @xcite , and chruciski and jurkowski @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in all these references only the _ noninteracting _",
    "( @xmath21 ) case was considered .",
    "it is easy to see that the hamiltonian ( [ e4 ] ) is @xmath0 symmetric , where the action of parity @xmath22 is to interchange the loss and gain oscillators and its effect is given by @xcite @xmath23 whilst the action of time reversal @xmath24 is to change the signs of the momenta @xmath25 note that @xmath26 is _ not _ symmetric under @xmath22 or @xmath24 separately , but it is symmetric under combined @xmath22 and @xmath24 . for a one - dimensional system",
    ", @xmath22 reduces to the usual parity operator @xmath27 and @xmath24 is the usual time - reversal operator . because the balanced - loss - and - gain system is hamiltonian , the energy ( the value of @xmath26 ) is conserved ; that is , its numerical value is constant in time . however , the expression for the energy in ( [ e4 ] ) is not recognizable as a simple sum of kinetic and potential energy ( such as @xmath28 ) .",
    "the noteworthy feature of @xmath0-symmetric systems with balanced loss and gain is that they exhibit phase transitions .",
    "when the coupling of the two oscillators is small , the energy flowing into the @xmath8 resonator can not transfer fast enough to the @xmath5 resonator , where the energy is flowing out .",
    "thus , the system can not be in equilibrium .",
    "however , when the coupling constant @xmath1 exceeds a critical value , all of the energy flowing into the @xmath8 resonator can transfer to the @xmath5 resonator and the entire system can attain equilibrium .",
    "the system is in equilibrium only if the frequencies are real because complex frequencies indicate that there is exponential growth and decay .    to understand why there are phase transitions we plot the quartic polynomial @xmath18 in ( [ e3 ] ) to see whether this polynomial cuts the horizontal axis in four places ( in which case there are four real frequencies ) , two places ( in which case there are two real frequencies and two complex frequencies ) , or not at all ( here , there are four complex frequencies ) .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , for small values of @xmath1 there are no real frequencies , but as @xmath1 increases there is a transition at @xmath29 to a situation where there are four real frequencies .",
    "interestingly , one can see that when the coupling @xmath1 is sufficiently large , there is a second transition at @xmath30 .",
    "this transition is difficult to see in classical experiments because in the strong - coupling regime the loss and gain components must be so close that they overlap and therefore interfere with one another .",
    "for example , in the pendulum experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite the pendula would have to be so close that they touch and could no longer swing freely .",
    "this strong - coupling region is discussed for the case of coupled systems _ without _ loss and gain in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is referred to as the _ ultrastrong - coupling regime_.     in ( [ e3 ] ) for @xmath15 in the range @xmath31 . in these plots @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath1 has the values ( a ) @xmath34 ( this value of @xmath1 lies in the first broken @xmath0 region ) ; ( b ) @xmath35 ( this is the first transition ) ; ( c ) @xmath36 ( this value of @xmath1 lies in the unbroken @xmath0 region in which the frequencies are all real ) ; ( d ) @xmath37 ( this is the location of the second transition ) ; ( e ) @xmath38 ( this value of @xmath1 lies in the second broken @xmath0 region ) . ]    the signal that the system is in equilibrium is that the resonators exhibit _ rabi oscillations _ ( power oscillations between the two resonators ) as shown in fig .

    "when @xmath17 , the quartic equation ( [ e2 ] ) for @xmath15 reduces to the biquadratic equation ( [ e3 ] ) whose solutions are @xmath42 there are four real frequencies @xmath15 when @xmath1 is in the range @xmath43 this is the unbroken classical @xmath0-symmetric region .",

    "<S> the inspiration for this theoretical paper comes from recent experiments on a @xmath0-symmetric system of two coupled optical whispering galleries ( optical resonators ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optical system can be modeled as a pair of coupled linear oscillators , one with gain and the other with loss . </S>",
    "<S> if the coupled oscillators have a balanced loss and gain , the system is described by a hamiltonian and the energy is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> this theoretical model exhibits _ two _ @xmath0 transitions depending on the size of the coupling parameter @xmath1 . for small @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 symmetry is broken and the system is not in equilibrium , but when @xmath1 becomes sufficiently large , the system undergoes a transition to an equilibrium phase in which the @xmath0 symmetry is unbroken . for very large </S>",
