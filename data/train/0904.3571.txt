    "the estimated @xmath5 for @xmath49   is about 2  kcal / mol and is in fair agreement with the 1  kcal / mole estimate obtained using monte carlo simulations @xcite .",

    "[ eq : wrong0 ] with @xmath33   and @xmath35   ( fig .",

    "thus we can understand the observation that when eq .",
    "[ eq : wrong0 ] is used with the same coordination radii , a lower selectivity is predicted .",
    "the lower selectivity arises due to the cancellation of the effects of water occupancy in an ion - free coordination volume of the same size for both na@xmath1 and k@xmath1 .    before concluding this section",
    ", we present some thoughts on where the earlier @xcite development may have faltered .",
    "the coordination sphere is an open system in contact with an external bath that provides solvent molecules at a constant chemical potential , but the coordination volume and the number of particles it can hold are nowhere close to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus care is required in assigning a thermodynamic potential to the partition function of the system .",
    "further , the small - system under consideration will be sensitive to fluctuations .",
    "hence describing the system with different ensembles may not be equivalent .",
    "equivalence of ensembles is strictly valid only in the thermodynamic limit when relative fluctuations in the variables conjugate to those used to describe the ensemble are small .",
    "thus , perhaps , using an open system framework to study a system whose population is fixed ( cf .",
    "eq .  7 in supplementary information to ref .",
    "@xcite ) may explain the disagreement with results presented here .",
    "the present development avoids the subtleties noted above .",
    "the theoretical framework used here @xcite is grounded in well - established statistical mechanics , and the results ( for example , fig .",
    "[ fg : qc ] ) agree with physical reasoning .",
    "the probability of observing a given number of water molecules in neat water in an ion - free coordination volume codifies density fluctuations in the liquid at the scale of the coordination volume . including this effect suggests that free energy changes involved in modifying the coordination state of an ion in water @xcite is inadequate in explaining the ion selectivity in the ion channel .",
