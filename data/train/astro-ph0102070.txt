    "the soft x - ray transient xtej1550@xmath0564  was discovered by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) on mjd  51063 ( 1998 sept 7 ; mjd = jd@xmath0240000.5 ) with an intensity of @xmath20.07  crab in the 212  kev range @xcite and by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma - ray observatory in the 20100  kev range at a flux level of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the rxte / asm intensity increased steadily over the next few days , reaching @xmath21.7  crab on mjd  51071 @xcite .",
    "xtej1550@xmath0564  flared to 6.8  crab on mjd  5107551076 , making it the brightest x - ray nova observed with rxte to date @xcite .",
    "an optical counterpart with a magnitude of v=16 was identified on mjd  51065 ( orosz , bailyn & jain 1998 ) , and an orbital period of @xmath21.54 days was attributed to the system @xcite .",
    "a radio counterpart was discovered at the optical position with a flux density of 10@xmath42.5  mjy on mjd  51065 @xcite .",
    "evolving qpos @xcite and hard lags @xcite typical of black hole binaries were observed from xtej1550@xmath0564 .    in this paper",
    "we introduce briefly the radio emission from xtej1550@xmath0564  at the time of the 1998 outburst .",
    "a more detailed analysis will be presented in hannikainen et al .",
    "( 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "xtej1550@xmath0564  was observed at multiple radio frequencies during the september 1998 outburst . the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) made twelve observations of the source at 843  mhz between mjd 51065 and 51092 , while the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) made observations at 1.4 , 2.3 , 4.8 and 8.6  ghz between mjd  51073 and 51085 . in addition ,",
    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) images were obtained with the australian long baseline array ( lba ) at 2.29  ghz . the most 843  mhz and atca 4.8 and 8.6  ghz lightcurves",
    "are shown in the upper panel of figure 1 along with the epochs of the vlbi observations .      following the initial detection of xtej1550@xmath0564  on mjd  51065 , the most monitored the source at 843  mhz over the next 27 days ( figure 1 ) . between mjd  51065 and 51073",
    ", the source flux density remained between 10 and 30  mjy .",
    "after mjd  51073 the flux density began to increase , reaching 168  mjy on mjd  51076 , and peaking on mjd  51078 with a flux density of 375  mjy .",
    "the flux density then declined to 120  mjy over the next three days , with a continuing decline to 14  mjy on mjd  51092 , after which the monitoring ceased .",
    "the atca started observing xtej1550@xmath0564  on mjd  51073 while the flux density was still low ",
    "@xmath5  mjy at 4.8 and 8.6  ghz ( figure 1 ) .",
    "after the rise to 168  mjy detected with the most , the atca resumed observing the source and monitored it over the next ten days .",
    "the 4.8 and 8.6  ghz flux densities appear to peak approximately 0.5  days before the most peak , with flux densities of 283 and 234  mjy respectively and linear polarization @xmath2  6% .",
    "the atca flux densities then followed the same decline as the most , reaching a level of around 20  mjy at 4.8  ghz on mjd  51086.5 when monitoring was ceased .",
    "the linearly polarized flux also evolved during the outburst ( hannikainen et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , reminiscent of the behavior of gro  j1655@xmath040 during the 1994 ejection episodes @xcite .",
    "the vlbi observations were undertaken on mjd  51080.5 and mjd  51081.5 using the lba @xcite .",
    "on the first day , the 34-m dss45 , the 26-m hobart and the 22-m mopra antennas were used , while on the second day the 70-m dss43 replaced the dss45 , and the six 22-m dishes of the atca were also used .",
    "figure 2 shows the 2.29  ghz vlbi images obtained on mjd  51080.5 ( top ) and mjd  51081.5 ( bottom ) .",
    "the image from mjd  51081.5 shows three distinct components , and the structure has clearly evolved compared to the previous day .",
    "phase - referenced observations were not performed on either day so the zero coordinate in the images is arbitrary .",
    "however , changes in the spectral index , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , are consistent with the appearance of a third component ( figure 1 ) .",
    "although the overall 2-point spectral indices , both the 843  mhz4.8  ghz and the 4.88.6  ghz , stay relatively flat throughout the observing period ( much flatter , say , compared to groj1655@xmath040 which had @xmath6 of @xmath8 to @xmath9 during the 1994 ejection episodes ; hannikainen et al .",
    "2000a ) the 4.88.6  ghz spectral index does flatten from @xmath10 to @xmath11 just before the vlbi observations .",
    "thus , the central component in figure 2 ( bottom ) is tentatively identified with a new optically thick outburst .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then the apparent separation velocity of the outermost components between mjd  51080.5 and 51081.5 is @xmath1 @xcite , based on a distance estimate of 3.55  kpc derived from h  i observations .",
    "figure 3 shows the multiwavelength behavior of xtej1550@xmath0564 .",
    "the significance of the sequence of lightcurve features in each waveband is discussed in wu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and an in - depth analysis of the multiwavelength data is in hannikainen et al .",
    "( 2001 , in preparation ) , so here we shall only summarize the more salient features . the outburst sequence is characterized by an impulsive rise in hard x - rays accompanied by a gradual brightening in the soft x - rays , followed by a period of exponential - like decay in the hard x - ray luminosity , and then a giant flare in all wavebands .",
    "the hard and soft x - rays peaked simultaneously , while the radio flare maxima occurred about 1.31.8 days later .",
    "as the radio emission continued to decline to a low level after the flare , the x - ray intensities settled into a plateau , lingered for another 35 days , and then faded away .    in order to explain the first impulsive batse hard x - ray outburst , which does not conform to the standard disk - instability scenario , a model involving a magnetic secondary star",
    "is proposed @xcite . in this model",
    ", coronal magnetic activity lifts matter above the stellar surface of the secondary ( which is presumed to be a g / k subgiant ; see also bildsten & rutledge 1999 ) , and if this happens near the l@xmath12 point of the roche lobe , this matter will fall easily into the roche lobe of the black hole , as gravity is weak near the l@xmath12 point .",
    "provided the magnetic stress / tension is stronger than the gas pressure terms , matter can be trapped there and accumulate over time .",
    "eventually , this magnetic dam may burst leading to field - line breaking and a matter avalanche .",
    "the initial angular momentum of the matter with respect to the black hole is insignificant , as the matter is practically in free - fall from zero velocity .",
    "this flow will therefore be quasi - spherical , and deviation occurs only when approaching the black hole .",
    "an accretion shock forms when the infalling material encounters the centrifugal barrier of the hole , converting a portion of the kinetic energy to thermal energy , giving rise to radiation .",
    "these photons are then upscattered by the surging infalling matter to hard x - ray energies , which is observed as the first hard x - ray outburst . as the quasi - spherical flow subsides , the hard x - ray luminosity declines , and at the same time , residual matter with substantial angular momentum begins to condense in the equatorial plane to form an accretion disk  this is seen as the gradual rise in the soft x - rays ( see igumenschev , illarionov & abramowicz 1999 ) .",
    "irradiation of the secondary as a consequence of the first hard x - ray outburst will result in an increase of mass transfer , and provoke instabilities , seen in the large fluctuations in the soft x - ray luminosity between mjd  51070 and 51075 . as a result ,",
    "the accretion disk becomes unstable and portions of it collapse , leading to mass ejection , as evidenced by the radio flare and the discrete components observed with the vlbi .",
    "the xtej1550@xmath0564  hard and soft x - ray flare in 1998 september was accompanied by radio emission .",
    "the radio outburst , which reached 375  mjy at 843  mhz , lagged the x - ray flare by 1.8 days .",
    "there was spectral evolution during the outburst , and polarization was detected at the 6% level .",
    "the vlbi images showed evolving structure confirming that there was an outflow from the system .",
    "the inferred superluminal separation velocity of the two outermost components , @xmath13 , strengthens the argument for xtej1550@xmath0564 being a black - hole binary system similar to groj1655@xmath040 and grs1915 + 105 .",
