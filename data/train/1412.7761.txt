    "the study of extra - solar planets has been driven forward by the discovery and detailed analysis of those planets that transit the disc of their host star .",
    "these transiting systems provide information on the planet s radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and absolute mass , information that is vital for the accurate characterisation of both the planet and star .",
    "planets transiting bright stars ( @xmath18 ) are particularly prized ; they enable detailed follow - up studies that can provide confirmation of the planets existence , as well as allowing the exploration of the planets characteristics , such as spin - orbit alignment and atmospheric composition .",
    "the space - based kepler @xcite transit survey mission has vastly expanded the size of the exoplanet population , and has discovered small , earth - like planets , circumbinary planets , and multi - planet systems that are inaccessible to instruments on the ground .",
    "it is the ground - based surveys though , such as the wide angle search for planets ( wasp ; @xcite ) , hatnet @xcite , tres @xcite , xo project @xcite , and kelt @xcite , that are leading the way in the discovery of planets orbiting bright stars .",
    "wasp is by far the most successful of these surveys , with more than 100 published planet discoveries to date .",
    "a recent study of f , g , and k stars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) showed that approximately @xmath19percent of solar - type stars have binary companions with periods of @xmath20days @xcite .",
    "this supports earlier results by @xcite ( @xmath21percent solar type stars in binaries ) , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "however , the binary fraction seems to be lower for exoplanet systems @xcite , indicating a suppression of planet formation @xcite .",
    "there is a strong selection effect acting against binary systems in planet search programs , that @xcite acknowledge and @xcite correct for .",
    "the presence of a companion star to the planet host introduces the problem of light from said star contaminating either the photometric observations ( diluting the transit depth ) , spectroscopic observations ( introducing a second set of spectral lines , and thus a second cross - correlation function peak ) , or both .",
    "the level of contamination depends on several factors - the resolution of the instrument , aperture size , fibre diameter , seeing , the separation of the stars , and the magnitude difference between the stellar components .",
    "these factors vary considerably from system to system , and the presence of a binary companion to an exoplanet candidate star tends to reduce the likelihood of that candidate becoming the target of follow - up observations .",
    "nevertheless , there are several examples of hot jupiter exoplanets in s - type orbits around binary stars , including wasp-70ab @xcite ; wasp-77ab @xcite ; wasp-94ab and bb @xcite ; kelt-2ab @xcite , and kepler-14ab @xcite .",
    "analysis of the known planets in binary systems deal with the contamination in different ways . for their analysis of wasp-70ab",
    ", @xcite corrected the photometric data using flux ratios derived from their observations .",
    "a similar approach was taken by @xcite for wasp-94ab , and by @xcite for wasp-77a .",
    "kepler-14ab is possibly the most similar system to that we consider here , and @xcite account for the dilution by placing a prior on the flux ratio of the binary components .",
    "the most complex approach is that of @xcite for kelt-2ab , who carry out an iterative combination of markov chain monte carlo analysis and sed fitting to constrain the transit depth .    in this paper",
    "we present the discovery of wasp-85ab , a transiting hot jupiter exoplanet with mass @xmath22@xmath2 and radius @xmath23@xmath4 .",
    "the solar - type host star , wasp-85a is the brighter component of a close visual binary , bd+07@xmath242474 , while the companion star , wasp-85b , is cooler than the host star , but of similar magnitude .",
    "the presence of the companion star complicates the standard analysis procedure used for wasp planets ; we account for the 3rd light contamination by adding an additional term to our stellar model , derived from our photometric data and controlled by a markov chain monte carlo jump parameter and prior.there is a clear , long - term trend in the position angle between the binary components , which indicate an orbit of @xmath25years for the binary .",
    "the system lies in the field of view of k2 campaign1 , and was observed in both long and short cadence modes .",
    "the k2 light curve clearly shows the planetary transits , along with the signature of stellar variability .",
    "analysis of the k2 data from both observing modes is ongoing , and will be presented in a follow - up paper .    in section[sec :",
    "obs ] we detail the photometric and spectroscopic observations of the wasp-85 system , while in section[sec : analysis ] we discuss the methods by which we derive the system parameters .",
    "we discuss the characteristics of the star and planet in section[sec : discuss ] , and conclude by summarising our results in section[sec : summary ] . throughout the manuscript we use the tdb time standard and barycentric julian dates in our analysis , following the advice set out in @xcite .",
    "our results are based on the equatorial solar and jovian radii , and masses taken from allen s astrophysical quantities .",
    "for a detailed account of the wasp telescopes , observing strategy , data reduction , and candidate identification and selection procedures , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "bd+07@xmath242474 lies near the celestial equator , and was thus observed by both superwasp - north ( located at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on la palma , spain ) and wasp - south ( located at the south african astronomical observatory near sutherland , south africa ) .",
    "these observations resulted in @xmath26 data , spanning the period 2008 - 02 - 05 to 2011 - 03 - 29 .",
    "the system was first identified as a planet candidate from superwasp - north data in 2008 .",
    "initial analysis revealed transit like features with an apparent period of @xmath27days .",
    "this signal was subsequently identified in both the superwasp - north and wasp - south photometry independently , and the star was selected for photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "subsequent to these observations , the secondary peak in the periodogram , at @xmath28days , was found to be the correct period .",
    "the radius of the synthetic aperture ( @xmath29 ) used to extract the flux of bd+07@xmath242474 is much greater than the maximum binary separation ( @xmath30 ; see section[sec : binary ] ) , such that the wasp lightcurve includes flux contributions from both components of the binary .",
    "initial spectroscopic reconnaissance was carried out between 2008 and 2010 using the sophie spectrograph @xcite mounted on the @xmath31-m telescope of the observatoire de haute - provence ( ohp ) , resulting in the acquisition of @xmath32 spectra .",
    "rvs were derived through cross - correlation with a spectral mask suitable for a star of g2 spectral type .",
    "the separation of the binary components is smaller than the fibre diameter of sophie ( @xmath33 ) , and thus the radial velocities ( rvs ) obtained from this instrument are contaminated by the contribution of the companion .",
    "these data show a sinusoidal variation in radial velocity ( rv ) with a period of @xmath28days , in disagreement with the period identified in the wasp lightcurves .",
    "further spectroscopic observations were made using the fibre - fed coralie spectrograph at the euler - swiss telescope at eso s la silla observatory , and using harps at the eso @xmath34 m telescope , also at la silla .",
    "a total of @xmath35 observations were made using coralie between 2009 january 03 and 2014 june 24 . for details of the instrument and data reduction procedure ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "rvs were derived using cross - correlation with a spectral mask suitable for a g2-type star , and confirmed the @xmath28day period as the correct one . unfortunately , while the coralie guiding camera is able to identify the presence of both stellar components , the aperture of the spectrograph ( @xmath36 ) is insufficiently small to access a single stellar component at a time .",
    "the coralie spectra are therefore also contaminated by light from the companion star .",
    "the level of contamination is seeing dependent owing to the close similarity of the aperture size and binary separation , rendering a correction to the rvs both uncertain and difficult to make .",
    "eight observations of the brighter binary component ( hereafter wasp-85a ) , and five observations of the fainter companion star ( hereafter wasp-85b ) were made using harps .",
    "the small spectrograph aperture ( @xmath37diameter ) and good seeing allowed the components to be observed separately , with little contamination from the other star .",
    "rvs were extracted in the same manner as for the coralie observations .",
    "we check for false positives induced by background eclipsing binaries or stellar activity by examining the bisector span measurements for our data .",
    "we find no significant correlation with the radial velocities or the radial velocity residuals , although the observations for wasp-85b do seem to show a negative correlation between the parameters .",
    "this is indicative of stellar activity @xcite .",
    "we also plot the full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) of our radial velocity observations as a function of orbital phase , checking for variations in phase @xcite . none",
    "are seen ( see figure[fig : bisector ] ) .",
    "we confirm which binary component is the planet host by checking for phasing of the harps radial velocity observations .",
    "the observations of wasp-85a show variations in phase with both the photometry , and with the coralie and sophie observations , while the observations of wasp-85b show variations that are not correlated with the phase determined from the lightcurve .    .",

    "we show only a small window around phase0 to focus on the planetary transit , and have corrected for the stellar activity using a simple median filter with a window size of @xmath696 times the length of the time series .",
    "this simple correction for activity leads to slightly increased scatter between contact points two and three of the transit .",
    "the transit depth is approximately @xmath68magnitudes , less than the transit depth listed in table[tab : results ] .",
    "this is to be expected given the large pixel scale of the kepler spacecraft s ccd , which means that the stellar components of the system will be blended together as was the case for our other photometry .",

    "the host star is similar to the sun , but has super - solar metallicity , while the companion is a cooler k - dwarf of similar magnitude .",
    "the caiih+k activity indices for the two stars indicate that both are strongly active , particularly when compared to other hot jupiter hosts .",
    "our photometric observations of wasp-85 are contain light from both binary components , necessitating the addition of a third light component to the standard transit model , and the modification of our standard wasp analysis routines .",
    "spectroscopic observations with coralie and sophie are also diluted by the companion , so we use only radial velocity data obtained with harps to perform our modelling .",
    "we find that the primary effect of the dilution is to decrease the radial velocity semi - amplitude for the affected datasets . if we fail to account for the contamination of the photometry , the derived planet radius decreases by @xmath16percent .",
    "the binary position angle shows a clear , long - term , negative trend that suggests an orbit of @xmath681years .",
    "this is at odds with the period derived from the mean binary angular separation , indicating that the binary is likely inclined relative to our line of sight by @xmath686 .",
    "the planet s orbit is therefore misaligned with the binary plane .",
    "bd+07@xmath242474 has been observed at short cadence as part of k2 campaign1 .",
    "we have presented the k2 long cadence lightcurve for the system , which clearly shows the variability resulting from stellar activity , with the planetary transits superposed .",
    "k2 is unable to distinguish the binary components .",
    "analysis of this new data is ongoing , and will be presented in a follow - up paper .",
