    "[ subsec : tuneje ] to discussing the adjustments to the technique to deal with these additional challenges . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we delineate some future directions and possible further applications of the present work .",
    "as previously discussed , there are many degrees of freedom at the time of programming a quantum annealing device to solve a specific problem instance .",
    "each realization of such degrees of freedom determine what we call a _ hamiltonian specification _ for the quantum annealing cycles .",
    "for the purpose of generality , we leave the discussion at a very high - level form and in the following sections we will present application examples in different common practical scenarios , e.g. , gauge selection and setting the strength of couplings among physical qubits representing a qubit from the original logical graph , also known as the embedding parameter setting problem  @xcite . in this general framework",
    "presented here , we only need to keep in mind that the performance of the device is determined by the programming degrees of freedom through the different hamiltonian specifications .",
    "the main question we discuss next : how do we select the hamiltonian realization that yields the best performance of the device ?",
    "it is the focus of this section to answer this question with a procedure requiring a minimum overhead , as described next .",
    "assume that for each hamiltonian specification you can easily request a total number of readouts @xmath14 from the quantum annealer . in some cases",
    ", these @xmath14 must be obtained in batches due to programming limitations .",
    "for example , in the current d - wave two processor hosted at nasa ames , programming the device with an annealing time per cycle of @xmath15 allows for a maximum number of readouts of 10,000 .",
    "if the device is operated at @xmath16 this maximum number is 50,000  , the reason why the maximum number of readouts at @xmath16 is @xmath17 while only @xmath18 at @xmath15 ] .",
    "therefore , while at @xmath16 a goal of @xmath20 can be obtained in one shot , at @xmath15 we need to request 5 repetitions of 10,000 each .",
    "let s denote the number of repetitions needed by @xmath21 and therefore the number of readouts in each repetition is @xmath22 .    for each readout , @xmath23",
    "there is a corresponding @xmath24 ( eq .  [ eq : eising ] ) .",
    "let s define by @xmath25 as the array containing the @xmath26 sorted energies , i.e. , @xmath27 such that @xmath28 for all @xmath29 .",
    "define @xmath30 as the negative of the mean value of the lowest @xmath31 percent of the energies in @xmath25 . since the array @xmath25 contains @xmath26 sorted energies from lowest to highest , then this expectation value is equivalent to calculating the mean value using the first @xmath32 values in @xmath25 .",
    "formally defined , @xmath33    since only a fixed percent of the lowest energy values are included in the calculation , we refer to this score function hereafter as the _",
    "elite mean_. this expression can be generalized to the case where several repetitions are used to collect the desirable total number of samples @xmath14 by defining @xmath34    the minus sign in the definition eq .",
    "[ eq : pielite ] gives @xmath30 the interpretation of a score function or a performance estimator ; the higher its value , the better the expected performance .",
    "suppose one has several quantum annealers or several hamiltonian specifications to choose from .",
    "if one is interested in assessing the performance of the device with a number of reads @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is defined as the number of readouts needed to find the desired solution at least once with a 99% probability ) , we will show that @xmath37 serves as an effective score function or performance estimator that can be used to rank and to select the best of available quantum annealing specifications to solve the problem at hand .",
    "the intuition for this score function follows from what is expected of a quantum annealing device : when given a problem to be solved , the quantum annealers ( or the hamiltonian specifications ) that give the lower energy solutions are preferable , since a quantum annealer is designed to sample from the lowest energy configurations .",
    "therefore , the quantum annealer specification with the lower _ elite mean energy _ ( or higher elite - mean score @xmath38 ) , will give better performance .      in quantum annealing ,",
    "the most natural gold standard for assessing performance is the probability of observing the ground state , since it translates into the probability of finding the optimal solution to the optimization problem studied . in more precise terms , let s define the success probability of our quantum annealing algorithms by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 corresponds to the number of observed ground states in the total number of requested readouts @xmath41 . given @xmath42 , the number of repetitions needed to observe the optimal solution at least once with a 99% probability , @xmath36 is given by @xcite , @xmath43    the instances that will benefit the most from our selection approach are those hard - to - solve instances with a very low probability of obtaining the ground state , say with an @xmath36 in the order of hundreds of millions or hundreds of millions like the example discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : tuneje ] ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show a correlation of the performance estimator and the real performance of the machine .",
    "but how do we define or assess real performance when the number of ground states is not reasonably attainable for all the hamiltonian configurations we explored ?",
    "take for example the instance in sec .",
    "[ subsec : tuneje ] .",
    "the default setting of the device does not provide even a single ground state solution after @xmath45 readouts ! to calculate @xmath42 for all gauges we would need to run for all 100 gauges being considered at least @xmath46 , which is beyond the scope of this work . in this work we explore two definitions of performance that allow us to rank different hamiltonian configurations even in the case where the ground state is not obtained after a significantly large @xmath41 .",
    "the first and natural criteria is a _ greedy - like performance rank_. this method gives a lower ( better ) rank to a hamiltonian specification with a lower energy . in the common case of ties , they are broken by looking at the frequency ( number of occurrences ) of their lowest energy state . in case these are the same , the next lowest energy is compared and if they are still the same , one compares their frequencies .",
    "the process continue until ties are broken , providing winners that are accordingly ranked lower .",
    "this method allows us to assign a unique ranking to any hamiltonian specification whether or not we measured any ground states . notice that in the particular case where the ground state is obtained for all the hamiltonian configurations explored , the performance rank will still assign lower ranks to hamiltonian specifications with larger values of @xmath42 , as desired , while breaking any ties that exist .",
    "benchmark studies assessing the presence or absence of speed - up of quantum annealers compared to classical processors resort to gauge selection as a way of obtaining reliable averaged results of the performance of the device  @xcite .",
    "although it is known that gauge specification can significantly enhance the performance of the device , previous studies are limited to the scaling of the typical gauge since there is no _ a priori _ way to determine the optimal gauge .",
    "gauge specification is a particular example of hamiltonian specification discussed above .",
    "we present here how our performance estimator @xmath38 can be used to select the optimal gauges . to illustrate the procedure , we used a hard - instance out of a pool of random - spin glass instances similar to the ones reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "this instance was provided by sergio boixo , who assessed that this particular instance had a simulated - annealing ( sa ) runtime of the order of hundred times longer than the median instance , from a pool of hundreds of thousands of instances within the same family ( instances with random couplings @xmath47 , with 509 qubits as shown in fig .

    "[ fig : pielite_vs_performance](b ) corroborates this assessment ; the median gauge over a set of 100 random gauges has a @xmath49 , resulting in a expected number of repetitions to solution of @xmath50 annealing cycles . since @xmath51 is about two hundred times greater than @xmath20 , applying our performance estimator to select the optimal gauge before engaging in lengthier runs is expected to significantly reduce the computational time .",
    "[ fig : pielite_vs_performance](a ) shows there is a strong correlation between the rank obtained with @xmath52 with @xmath20 and @xmath53 , compared to the greedy performance rank described above .",
    "the number of total readouts used to estimate the performance rank is @xmath54 million per gauge .",
    "the error bars correspond to the rank provided by the first and third quartile out of 40 different experiment each with @xmath20 for each of the 100 random gauges .",
    "the middle point corresponds to the median of the set of experiments .",
    "[ fig : pielite_vs_performance](b ) shows the same data set but with the raw values for @xmath52 and also serves the purpose of showing the count in the number of ground states , illustrating that gauge selection can have a significant impact in the device performance , an increase as much as one to two orders of magnitude ( see also fig .",

    "[ fig : consist_6f_20us](b ) reflecting how the gauge selection can influence @xmath40 . )        as expected , any performance estimator would be a noisy metric and not expected to have a 100% correlation with the real performance from an extensive number of readouts @xmath55 .",
    "the rs section of table  [ table : fractions_greedyrank ] ( upper half ) addresses this issue .",
    "suppose one utilizes the following strategy .",
    "one decides to run 100 gauges with a fixed @xmath14 for each gauge . from this starting data set , and",
    "while processing the readouts in the search of an optimal solution , one can easily calculate @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath35 , it is unlikely that this initial batch of calculations would contain the optimal solution .",
    "the refinement we propose here consists of using the information of the @xmath37 calculated _ on - the - fly _ to select , for example , the top 5 gauges ( gauges with the highest @xmath37 score ) out of the 100 random gauges .",
    "since the selected gauges are expected to have a better performance than the typical or average gauge , only the selected ones are used to continue with the remaining runs @xmath56 until the desired solution is found .",
    "given this strategy , table  [ table : fractions_greedyrank ] answer the question : what is the probability that the absolute top gauge ( that is , ranked number 1 according to the performance rank in sec .",
    "[ subsec : ranking ] ) is contained in this set of predicted top 5 gauges ? what is the probability of one finding any of the top 2 gauges in the set of predicted top 5 gauges ? etc , etc . notice that at the level of @xmath57 which is @xmath0200 times less than @xmath51 , one obtains a reasonably high @xmath075% probability of obtaining the top 1 gauge in the set top 5 gauges predicted by @xmath58 .",
    "table  [ table : fractions_greedyrank ] also addresses the question of the existence of an optimal value of @xmath31 for the performance estimator . in all the examples considered here",
    "it seems to be the case that a value of @xmath59% or @xmath54% is optimal , a non - trivial result , since one might think incorrectly that the greater the number of low energy states included in the calculation of @xmath58 the better .",
    "this table also shows the expected increase in the probability of choosing the top gauges as @xmath14 becomes larger .",
    "note also the inclusion in the table of a  greedy \" column for each case .",
    "this new metric was included because the use of the greedy method for the _ performance rank _ described in section b begs the question of why one could not use an even simpler performance estimator consisting of the same _ greedy approach _ applied here to the case of a small number @xmath14 instead of @xmath41 .",
    "however , the table clearly shows that @xmath58 is consistently always as good as , if not much better than , the greedy performance estimator .",

    "[ fig : consist_6f_20us ] , calculating the elite mean over the five lowest energies already gives a good correlation with @xmath40 .",

    "in contrast with the case of the rs instance above , here we can not use @xmath60 to calculate the score function since , for example , the lowest energies of @xmath60 will be different for every value of @xmath87 ( because of the energy renormalization to fit all programmable values @xmath88 and @xmath65 within the dynamical range @xmath89 and @xmath7 ) . to circumvent this issue",

    "since the data needs to be processed anyway ( e.g. , calculation of @xmath61 and majority voting while testing whether or not the desired solution has been found ) , the only overhead incurred is the time needed to sort the solution before calculating the elite mean . in the case of other parameter settings such as the one used in the embedding problem , our performance estimator provides a very efficient approach by pinning down the region where the device has its best performance .",
