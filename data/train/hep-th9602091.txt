    "the problem of divergence of ( renormalized ) perturbation theory , which can be traced back to the seminal work of dyson in quantum electrodynamics @xcite , is now recognized to lie at the core of any precise analytic understanding of the nonperturbative structure of field theory .",
    "the need to face this problem squarely is particularly apparent in massless quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , where the underlying dynamics is specified by a single parameter @xmath0 ( for gauge group @xmath1 ) .",
    "dimensionless ratios of hadron masses in this theory depend only on @xmath0 , which is of order unity ( @xmath23 ) in the physical world .",
    "apart from the technically intractable 1/@xmath0 expansion , there is no natural _ intrinsic _ expansion parameter for the spectral and other low - energy properties of the theory . if one insists on computing such quantities in a conventional weak - coupling expansion , they either vanish formally to all orders , or yield asymptotic expansions in terms of a running coupling which is naturally of order unity",
    ". such expansions are quantitatively useless in the absence of a reliable  resummation \" procedure .",
    "certain superrenormalizable field - theories ( e.g @xmath3 in the unbroken phase ) have been shown rigorously @xcite,@xcite to possess borel - summable perturbative expansions , so that the full content of the theory ( at least , information - theoretically ) is exhausted by perturbation theory .",
    "the spontaneously broken phases of these theories is typically not borel - summable , but even here an optimized reorganization of the perturbation theory can be shown rigorously @xcite to converge to the exact partition function , provide the theory is formulated at finite volume .",
    "the failure of borel - summability is far more severe in qcd @xcite , and no systematic analytic procedure is known , even in principle , whereby the full nonperturbative structure of the theory could be obtained on the basis of purely perturbative information .",
    "the divergence of the perturbation theory in qcd is far more than a merely technical embarassment , as has recently been emphasized by mueller @xcite .",
    "it fundamentally limits our ability to reliably compute important corrections ( such as higher twist effects ) to the vast phenomenology of high energy processes described by perturbative qcd .",
    "specifically , in those cases where one attempts to weld analytic perturbative with numerical or phenomenological nonperturbative estimates for the same process , the precision of the result is clouded by unavoidable resummation ambiguities on the perturbative side .",
    "consider , for example , a renormalization group controlled amplitude @xmath4 in qcd , expressible as a formal ( divergent asymptotic ) series in the running coupling @xmath5 : @xmath6 quite generically , one may identify subsets of graphs in perturbation theory which contribute factorial growth to the dimensionless coefficients @xmath7 at large @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the first two coefficients of the beta function , and @xmath11 is a positive integer . using stirling s approximation , the @xmath8-th term in the asymptotic series ( [ eq : piseries ] ) may be written @xmath12 which is minimal at @xmath13 . the error in an asymptotic expansion is typically _ at least as large _ ( it may of course be much larger ! ) as the smallest term , here @xmath14 which is power suppressed at large @xmath15 in just the way we expect for a higher twist term .",
    "the moral is clear : higher twist effects are not precisely calculable in the absence of a reliable resummation procedure .",
    "the same arguments in fact apply in a variety of other important situations : for heavy quark expansions , where @xmath16 effects ( @xmath17=heavy quark mass ) may be confused with resummation ambiguities arising in a static - quark quantity evaluated via the renormalization group in terms of a perturbative expansion in @xmath18 , or in estimating analytically power corrections to lattice quantities in the lattice spacing @xmath19 .",
    "the conventional borel transform approach ( for a thorough review , see @xcite ) attempts to reconstruct the full nonperturbative structure of the theory from knowledge of the behavior of weak - coupling perturbation theory at large orders .",
    "there are two serious problems with such an approach in infrared unstable theories like qcd .",
    "first , it is becoming increasingly apparent that the large - order behavior is exceedingly complex @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult , even restricting oneself to a strictly limited subset of graphs , to precisely identify the terms which give the truly dominant behavior at large order , due to the subtle interplay of combinatoric and kinematic effects .",
    "secondly , in a non - borel - summable theory ( and any infrared unstable theory with dynamical mass generation falls into this category ) there is in any case no reliable reconstruction theorem based on the usual perturbative borel transform , which develops singularities ( renormalons ) on the positive real axis of the borel variable @xmath20 , i.e on the borel integral contour .",
    "fortunately , an alternative formulation of the borel transform exists , first discussed in qcd by thooft @xcite , and later by crutchfield @xcite and david @xcite .",
    "this form of the transform is closely connected to the  naive \" perturbative definition in borel - summable theories , but can be used to give a precise reconstruction theorem in a much wider class of theories .",
    "the singularity structure of this transform is unambiguously related to the exact nonperturbative structure of the full theory .",
    "but by the same token , this structure is not directly accessible in conventional perturbation theory , but must be studied in an explicitly nonperturbative way .",
    "the primary objective of this paper is to suggest that useful information about the renormalon structure ( i.e positive @xmath20 singularities ) in infrared unstable theories can indeed be obtained using nonperturbative techniques ( such as the large n expansion , or lattice theory ) . in section 2 , we review very quickly the conventional perturbative borel transform @xmath21 , and explain its relation to the generalized transform @xmath22 and the density of states function @xmath23",
    ". a classification of renormalon singularities into those which are already present at finite volume (  type 1 \" ) and those which are only strictly speaking present at infinite volume (  type 2 \" ) is given .",
    "the basic interconnections are further illustrated using spin models in 1 and 2 dimensions ( the nonlinear sigma model ) in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we explain the perturbative camouflage of renormalon singularity structure in disconnected quantities such as the partition function ( vacuum - vacuum amplitude ) .",
    "the status of the first infrared renormalon singularity in qcd ( recently raised by brown , yaffe and zhai @xcite ; see also @xcite ) is discussed in section 4 .",
    "it is shown that certain renormalon singularities of the full borel function @xmath22 are immune to infrared cutoffs in ordinary perturbation theory which remove the usual ir renormalons .",
    "moreover , the presence of such a singularity appears to be a generic feature once dynamical mass generation is assumed . in section 5",
    "we study the sigma model at large n on the lattice in order to establish the numerical feasibility of extracting renormalon singularities by analytic continuation of nonperturbatively computed ( say , by monte carlo simulation ) euclidean amplitudes .",
    "section 6 summarizes our conclusions and indicates directions for further study .",
    "the archetypal example of a borel - summable perturbation theory is the nongaussian integral @xmath24 evidently the coefficients @xmath25 in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath26 for @xmath27 have the large order behavior @xmath28 .",
    "define the  naive \" borel transform @xmath29 so that @xmath30 and @xmath26 have the same asymptotic expansion for small @xmath31 . in this case",
    "the analytic properties of @xmath26 are such ( see ref @xcite for precise conditions ) that @xmath32 and knowledge of the  naive \" transform leads to a precise reconstruction of z for all @xmath31 .",
    "we shall actually be using a more powerful version of the borel method in most of this paper , which will circumvent the need for theorems of this type whcih certify the preceding procedure .",
    "the shortcomings of @xmath21 for non - borel - summable theories , where the sign oscillation in @xmath25 is absent in some uncancelled set of contributions at large order ( _ not necessarily the dominant ones _ ! ) are immediately apparent : @xmath21 develops singularities on the positive real @xmath20 axis , rendering the reconstruction integral ambiguous ( if the singularities are non - integrable ) .",
    "the most straightforward way in which such singularities can arise is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : v(x ) ] , where the  action \" @xmath33 possesses a secondary nonperturbative extremum .    to    to expose the singularity in @xmath21 write @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 if @xmath36 has a nontrivial extremum where @xmath37 , we will have necessarily @xmath38 , a singularity ( in this case , an integrable square - root singularity , as @xmath39 ) for positive @xmath20 . to the extent that the interchange of integrations carried out in eq([eq : zbtilde ] ) is legal",
    ", the reconstruction of @xmath40 from @xmath41 must be precise .",
    "in fact @xmath41 is intimately related to the more general borel function to be introduced below . in general , however , @xmath42 !",
    "of course , the asymptotic expansions for small @xmath20 of @xmath43 , which determine the asymptotic expansion of @xmath26 for small @xmath31 , must agree . as pointed out originally by thooft @xcite , the existence of euclidean extrema of the action ( instantons ) in qcd implies in a similar way the presence of singularities in @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the location of the singularities ( though not their strength ) is universal ( see ( @xcite ) : once a singularity appears in any amplitude of the theory , it is expected to propagate to all others .    for a class of non - borel - summable theories ( the archetype is the double well anharmonic oscillator ) an optimized reorganization of perturbation theory",
    "can be shown to converge with exponential rapidity @xcite to the exact partition function .",
    "these convergence proofs apply only when the theory is formulated at finite volume , however , limiting the practical usefulness of such methods in higher dimensional field theories .",
    "the approach taken here will be to employ a generalized borel transform which allows a  bulletproof \" reconstruction of the full theory , avoids resummation ambiguities , and is more closely tied to the path integral formulation of the theory @xcite .",
    "our ultimate objective is to explore the potential of the presently available nonperturbative lattice techniques for computing the singularity structure of this transform .",

    "eq([eq : btildedef ] ) ) .",
    "singularities of @xmath41 are expected wherever there is a sharp local enhancement in the number of configurations , for example wherever the action has a local extremum .",
    "the rigorous reconstruction of @xmath26 from @xmath41 is trivial in this framework .",
    "the vertical contour of the inverse laplace transform may be wrapped around the cut on the positive @xmath20 axis to give an integral over the discontinuity of @xmath22 , i.e. over @xmath41 .",
    "more directly , we may simply observe that it follows from eq([eq : zphi],[eq : disc ] ) that @xmath65 this reconstruction is exact : there are no routing ambiguities in the @xmath20-integral .",
    "of course , @xmath41 is in general a distribution ( containing potentially @xmath66 singularities ) , not obtainable purely from knowledge of weak - coupling perturbation theory .",
    "instead , it must be computed nonperturbatively by analytic continuation of @xmath22 , computed nonperturbatively in the region re(@xmath67 , where the defining integral ( [ eq : gbt ] ) exists .",
    "it should be noted at this point that @xmath44 , in contrast to @xmath22 _ may have singularities _ in the left - half - plane ( corresponding to non - principal - sheet singularities of @xmath22 ) : the _ ultraviolet _ renormalons of the renormalized perturbation theory in qcd are of this type .",
    "it is convenient to distinguish between two types of singularities appearing in @xmath44 .",
    "exact local extrema of the euclidean action may exist even for systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom ( e.g. field theories formulated on a finite lattice ) .",
    "such extrema give rise to actual singularities ( henceforth called  type 1 \" ) of @xmath41 even at finite volume , when the theory is cutoff in the infrared .",
    "for example , one can find lattice analogs of the instanton solutions of the classical 2d o(3 ) sigma model using a simple numerical annealing procedure to solve the lattice euclidean field equations .",
    "other singularities of @xmath41 only appear at infinite volume , and will be called type 2 singularities .",
    "the famous infrared renormalons of large order perturbation theory are connected to singularities of this type . as numerical simulations of nonperturbative behavior",
    "are necessarily restricted to finite volume lattice theories , the question arises whether singularities of this type are really accessible using simulation techniques .",
    "we shall see below that the question is complicated by the nonuniformity of the analytic continuation to positive @xmath20 in the large volume limit , which will require a modification of the definition ( [ eq : gbt ] ) in the finite volume situation . for the time being , let us illustrate the absence of a true singularity in ( [ eq : gbt ] ) in a discrete system with a simple toy model .",

    "it is apparent that even if @xmath183 , the borel transform @xmath22 of the propagator @xmath184 has simple poles at @xmath185 , just as in ( [ eq : bsprop ] )",
    ". however , we have just seen that if @xmath183 , the usual _ perturbative _ sources of infrared renormalon singularities in the naive transform @xmath21 disappear ! in fact , the renormalon structure of the full borel function @xmath22 in this case is associated with the appearance of a zero - momentum condensate for the auxiliary o(n ) singlet field @xmath186 ( see ( [ eq:2dlatt ] ) ) , which couples to the singlet two @xmath47 channel .",
    "even though the individual @xmath103 constituents are restricted to have nonzero momentum @xmath187 , _ pairs _ of these quanta can condense at zero momentum , precisely as in the case of cooper pairs in bcs superconductivity .",
    "the moral of this example is clear : the full borel transform @xmath22 can have singularities of purely nonperturbative origin , not associated ( at least in any direct fashion ) with the usual ir renormalons of perturbation theory .",
    "the preceding discussion applies to the renormalon structure of the continuum field theory in which the momentum modes are still continuous , but a sharp infrared cutoff is introduced .",
    "the introduction of a finite lattice imposes an infrared cutoff uniformly on all fields of the theory , including the condensate field @xmath188 , thereby eliminating the singularities at @xmath185 of @xmath22 .",
    "it was pointed out in section 2 that a singularity in @xmath44 for the borel transform of the partition function @xmath26 is directly related to a singularity in the density of configurations in the defining functional integral for @xmath40 .",
    "consider the current - current correlator in quenched qcd ( i.e. dropping internal quark loops ) .",
    "the uv cutoff will be implemented on a lattice ( with a bare coupling @xmath189 ) and the compact link integrations written @xmath190 for simplicity . then ( again , representing the lattice fourier transform in continuum notation for simplicity ) : @xmath191e^{-\\frac{1}{\\alpha } s[a ] } \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\int{\\cal d}a_{\\mu } { \\cal p}[a;q]e^{-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}s[a]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath192 is the quark propagator in the background field @xmath193 .",

    "@xmath198 is the fundamental density of configurations in the theory . as pointed out by thooft in his seminal study of the renormalon structure of qcd @xcite , borel singularities in the transform of @xmath199 or @xmath26",
    "will generically transfer , via the convolution theorem , to the borel transform of the connected ratio @xmath200 , barring some miraculous cancellation .",
    "in fact , the location of renormalon singularities ( though not their type and strength ) are expected to be substantially independent of the specific green s function under consideration : rather , they derive from the basic structure of the functional configuration space of the theory .    it has sometimes been asserted that the presence or absence of renormalon singularities can be inferred solely from the assumption of nonperturbative validity of the wilson operator product expansion .",
    "for example , the absence of a perturbative ir renormalon in @xmath21 at @xmath201 was related above to the absence of local gauge - invariant operators of dimension 2 .",
    "such a singularity will never be visible in dimensionally renormalized massless perturbative qcd , where the only mass scale in the theory is introduced via the regularization procedure in such a way as to result in purely logarithmic ( rather than power ) contributions to renormalized quantities .",
    "rather , we are concerned here with intrinsically nonperturbative contributions to the coefficient function @xmath202 of the identity operator , which is present regardless of the subsequent set of nontrivial operators in the theory .",
    "such contributions , of the form @xmath203 in coordinate space , where @xmath68 is a dynamically generated squared mass of the form @xmath204 , inevitably produce a borel singularity at the _ first _",
    "location @xmath172 . on the other hand",
    ", they vanish formally to all orders in a weak coupling expansion , and ( in a non - borel theory ) are _ not necessarily reconstructible _ from conventional sources of factorial growth in perturbation theory ( cf .",
    "situation discussed above for 2d sigma model in presence of an ir cutoff ! ) .    finally , let us note that the presumed existence of a mass gap in the theory can be viewed as prima facie evidence for a universal infrared renormalon singularity at the first available location .",
    "it is very difficult to see how a singularity at @xmath201 can be avoided in almost any physical quantity in qcd once such a mass gap is assumed , together with the renormalization group and asymptotic freedom .",
    "as the simplest example , consider the finite temperature partition function of pure qcd at low temperature @xmath205 .",
    "evidently , for large @xmath206 , the one glueball sector dominates and ( defining @xmath207 ) @xmath208 the higher order terms are suppressed at low temperature , so can not be expected to cancel ( except accidentally ) any renormalon singularity found in the first nontrivial term .",
    "the borel transform @xmath209 of the 1-glueball contribution to the free energy @xmath210 thus becomes @xmath211 integrating by parts to expose the pole at @xmath172 we find @xmath212 a similar singularity is expected to arise in all connected green s functions of the theory once dynamical mass generation occurs .    of course , to settle this contentious issue definitively , it will be necessary to perform reliable , fully nonperturbative calculations of the generalized borel function @xmath22 .",
    "the only tool available for doing this in the case of qcd is lattice theory , so we must now face directly the issue of extracting renormalon structure of field theories formulated on a ( necessarily ) finite space - time lattice .",
    "if , as we have argued , weak - coupling perturbation theory is not a reliable guide to the full renormalon structure in an infrared unstable theory with dynamical mass generation , it will be necessary to carry out a fully nonperturbative evaluation of the borel function @xmath22 for the relevant physical quantity . in qcd , this restricts us to a numerical ( monte carlo ) simulation of the lattice gauge theory .",
    "there are two obvious difficulties which must be overcome .",
    "firstly , the information obtained in such a calculation is necessarily subject to statistical errors .",
    "consequently , any technique employed for the extraction of the singularity structure of @xmath22 for re@xmath136 ( obtained by analytic continuation from re@xmath140 ) must be fairly resistant to the inevitably noisy input information .",
    "secondly , simulations can only be performed of systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom , i.e. at finite volume .",
    "the borel transform @xmath22 ( [ eq : gbt ] ) will in this case lack the type 2 singularities associated with the condensation of zero momentum modes in the theory . in this section",
    "we shall explain one possible modification of the definition ( [ eq : gbt ] ) capable of revealing the precursors of the infinite volume singularity structure on a finite lattice .    as usual , a convenient model for studying the renormalon structure on a finite lattice",
    "is the o(n ) sigma model in 2 dimensions : the large n limit of the theory is analytically solvable , even on the lattice .",
    "we shall use this model to gain insight in formulating a modified lattice borel transform.we begin by pointing out a basic difficulty in the definition ( [ eq : gbt ] ) of the full borel function @xmath213 when the transform is applied to a lattice system with a mass gap generated via logarithmic infrared divergencies . to make the algebra as transparent as possible , consider the toy model of section 2 where the gap equation is modelled by the discrete sum @xmath214 here @xmath68 is the analog of the squared dynamical mass and we take @xmath215 as our model of the momentum space propagator , with borel transform @xmath216 this integral defines the analytic function @xmath213 for @xmath217 .",
    "the problem is that the @xmath218 limit does not commute with the desired analytic continuation to the right - half @xmath20-plane .",
    "this becomes clear if we subject ( [ eq : toybt ] ) to an integration by parts @xmath219 for @xmath220 , the integral in ( [ eq : blparts ] ) is now well - defined as @xmath218 ( as the integration is convergent for @xmath221 ) , but @xmath222 causes a power divergence @xmath223 if the large volume limit is taken after the analytic continuation is performed .    in the case of the sigma model at large @xmath0 , where we have analytic control of the theory , one may devise the following cure for this problem , which arises from the deviation at finite @xmath77 in the integration measure for small @xmath68 from the infinite volume form , namely , one devises a modified borel transform on the lattice which has a smooth analytic continuation to @xmath224 at large @xmath77 . in the @xmath218 limit , the integration measure goes over to @xmath225 . choosing an infrared cutoff @xmath226 ( the precise value is immaterial ) we may define an alternative transform of the ( nonperturbatively determined ! ) propagator @xmath71 on the lattice as @xmath227 with @xmath228 satisfying @xmath229 , i.e @xmath230 the relation ( [ eq : constraint ] ) ensures that the integrand @xmath231 in the first term in ( [ eq : btmod ] ) matches ( at @xmath232 ) smoothly to the corresponding lattice determined integrand @xmath233 in @xmath213 .",
    "the supplementary contribution generates a term @xmath234 as @xmath218 , exactly cancelling the pathological term in ( [ eq : blparts ] ) .",
    "we have checked that the above procedure leads to a numerically stable detection procedure for renormalon singularities using the test case of the 2d sigma model . as input to the borel transform",
    ", the feasibility of the method can be studied by using the analytic large n results ( instead of actual monte carlo data ) .",
    "statistical noise can also be introduced by hand to check the robustness of the procedure .",
    "the mass gap equation on a finite lattice for the 2d sigma model is @xmath235 where @xmath236 and @xmath237 . in the large n",
    "limit the momentum space @xmath103 propagator is @xmath238    to    in analogy to ( [ eq : btmod ] ) , we analytically continue the modified transform ( suppressing for notational simplicity the momentum dependence ) @xmath239 with @xmath240 , @xmath241 .",
    "the analytic continuation to positive real @xmath20 can be performed in a numerically stable way by writing @xmath242 and taylor expanding around @xmath243 ( where @xmath244 is analytic ) .",
    "the circle of convergence has radius @xmath245 , as @xmath246 is analytic in the cut plane , and we can evaluate @xmath247 by summing the series to some finite order @xmath248 at @xmath249 . the result for @xmath250 on a 30x30 lattice",
    "is shown in fig([fig : ginvg ] ) for the borel transform of both @xmath251 ( with @xmath252 ) and the inverse propagator @xmath253 .",
    "the effect of keeping more terms in the taylor expansion is shown in fig([fig : moreterms ] ) for the borel transform of @xmath253 .",
    "the peak at the first renormalon becomes sharper as @xmath248 increases .",
    "however , the results become ( for fixed @xmath254 ) less accurate as @xmath255 increases , which requires @xmath256 to approach the edge of the circle of convergence .    to",
    "finally , the sensitivity of the continuation procedure to a random superimposed 1% statistical noise on @xmath71 ( well within the reach of monte carlo simulations , for example ) is shown in fig([fig : noisy ] ) .",
    "the first renormalon is still clearly visible at @xmath257 , with the effects of the noise becoming serious only for @xmath258 . in all of these cases",
    ", we should emphasize that the first term in ( [ eq : blattmod ] ) is absolutely essential to obtain stable results from the analytic continuation .    to",
    "in this paper we have used the nonlinear sigma model as a convenient analytical platform for examining the interrelationship of various versions of the borel transform .",
    "infrared unstable theories ( like qcd or the sigma model ) with dynamical mass generation are inevitably non - borel summable , and a precise borel reconstruction of such theories is only possible starting from the generalized borel transform @xmath22 , defined as the laplace transform with respect to the inverse bare coupling of the relevant amplitude.(the complex nonperturbative behavior of such theories is entirely connected with the infrared structure , so it suffices to work throughout with an ultraviolet cutoff : in the case of qcd , this implies a lattice formulation . )",
    "unfortunately , the conventional definition of the borel transform in terms of the formal perturbative series ( for which we have used the notation @xmath21 ) does not lead to a precise reconstruction theorem in the nonborel case .",
    "this function extends ( in the sense of having identical asymptotic expansion for small @xmath20 ) to a function @xmath44 , the discontinuity of the generalized transform @xmath22 introduced above , which does however yield such a reconstruction .",
    "the essential difference between the two functions can be seen explicitly in the large @xmath0 limit of the nonlinear sigma model , where an infrared cutoff in the elementary modes of the theory can be seen to eliminate the conventional infrared renormalons of perturbation theory , while leaving the singularities in @xmath22 intact .",
    "the necessity for a fully nonperturbative approach to the generalized borel function @xmath22 leads us to the consideration of simulations on a finite lattice , which is often the only tool available for reliable nonperturbative calculation .",
    "the borel singularities on the positive @xmath20 axis have been seen to fall into two types .",
    "type 1 singularities are present ( as actual singularities ) already in the finite volume theory : however they are numerically camouflaged by perturbative prefactors in disconnected green s functions . finding such singularities on a finite lattice",
    "will therefore require removing disconnected vacuum contributions ( cf . section 4 ) .",
    "type 2 singularities ( the usual ir renormalons fall into this category ) are strictly speaking only present in the infinite volume limit .",
    "moreover , the interchange of analytic continuation to re(@xmath134 and the infinite volume limit is not uniform , requiring a modification ( discussed in section 6 ) of the definition of the borel transform on a finite lattice in order to allow detection of the renormalon precursors .",
    "such a modification indeed allows us to extract the location of renormalon singularities for the analytically tractable test case of the sigma model at large @xmath0 .",
    "the application to situations ( say , the sigma model with @xmath259 , or quenched qcd ) where monte carlo methods must be employed to compute the nonperturbative structure of the theory is presently under study .",
