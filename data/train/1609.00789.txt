    "during the last three decades , the double - folding model ( dfm ) of the optical potential ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) has been successfully used to calculate the real heavy - ion ( hi ) optical potential ( op ) for use in different nuclear reaction studies .",
    "it is straightforward to see from the basic folding formulas that the folding model generates the first - order ( hartree - fock type ) term of the feshbach s microscopic op @xcite .",
    "the success of the folding model description the observed elastic scattering of numerous hi systems , in particular , the nuclear rainbow pattern observed in the elastic scattering of the light hi systems @xcite , clearly suggests that the first - order term of the feshbach s microscopic op is indeed the dominant part of the real op .",
    "the basic inputs for a folding model calculation are the nuclear densities of the colliding nuclei and the effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction between the projectile nucleons and those in the target .",
    "a popular choice in the past for the effective nn interaction has been the m3y interaction @xcite which was designed to reproduce the g - matrix elements of the reid @xcite and paris @xcite nn potentials in an oscillator basis .",
    "the original ( density independent ) m3y interaction was used with some success in the folding model calculation of the real hi optical potential at low energies @xcite , where the elastic scattering data are sensitive to the potential only at the surface , near the strong absorption radius @xmath0 .",
    "situation becomes different in cases of the refractive scattering with the observation of the nuclear rainbow pattern @xcite , where the elastic data measured at large angles were shown to be sensitive to the real op over a wider radial range , down to small distances @xmath1 . here , the original m3y interaction failed to give a good description of the data , and several realistic choices of the density dependence were included into the m3y interaction @xcite to account for the reduction of the _ attractive _ strength of the effective nn interaction at high densities of the nuclear medium , as the two nuclei closely approach and overlap with each other at small distances .",
    "the explicit density dependence of the m3y interaction considered in the present work was parametrized @xcite to reproduce the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter ( nm ) in the standard hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation . to have a reliable density dependent interaction for use at different energies , the nucleon op in nm obtained in the hf calculation",
    "@xcite ( or the high - momentum part of the hf single - nucleon potential ) was used to adjust the explicit energy dependence of the density dependent m3y interaction against the observed energy dependence of the nucleon op . however , the hf single - nucleon potential @xcite is roughly equivalent to the single - particle potential of the brueckner - bethe theory @xcite , which lacks the _ rearrangement _ term that arises naturally in the landau theory for infinite fermi systems @xcite .",
    "such a rearrangement term ( rt ) also appears when the single - nucleon potential is evaluated from the total nm energy using the hugenholtz and van hove ( hvh ) theorem @xcite , which is exact for all systems of interacting fermions , independent of the type of the interaction between fermions .    for infinite nm ,",
    "it is straightforward to see that the hvh theorem is satisfied on the hf level only when the in - medium nn interaction is density independent , i.e. , when the rt is equal zero @xcite . as a result , the single - nucleon ( or nucleon mean - field )",
    "potential in nm evaluated on the hf level using an in - medium , density dependent nn interaction is not compliant with the hvh theorem .",
    "it is of interest , therefore , to have a method to take into account properly the rt of the single - nucleon potential in nm on the hf level using the same density dependent nn interaction that was determined to reproduce the saturation properties of symmetric nm .",
    "based on the exact expression of the rt of the single - nucleon potential given by the hvh theorem at each nm density and the empirical energy dependence of the nucleon op observed over a wide range of energies , a compact method has been suggested recently @xcite to account effectively for the rt in the standard hf scheme , by supplementing the density dependent cdm3yn interaction @xcite with the explicit contributions of the rt and of the momentum dependence of the nucleon mean - field potential .    for finite nuclei , the rt appears naturally @xcite when the variational principle is applied to solve the eigenvalue problem in the hf calculation , using an effective density dependent nn interaction .",
    "such a rt in the hf energy density of finite nuclei is known to describe the rearrangement of the mean field due to the removal or addition of a single particle @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been observed experimentally in the nucleon removal reactions at low energies that the interaction between the projectile nucleon and a target nucleon can induce some rearrangement of the single - particle configurations of other nucleons in the target @xcite . in terms of the interaction , such a rearrangement effect should also affect the shape and strength of the microscopic op constructed in the folding model using the single - particle wave functions of the projectile- and target nucleons .",
    "because the standard double - folding calculations of the potential are being done mainly on the hf level @xcite , the impact of the rearrangement effect to the folded op has not been studied so far .",
    "the present work is the first attempt to address this important issue . for this purpose , an extended version of the dfm",
    "is proposed to effectively include the rt into the folded op in the same mean - field manner , using consistently the same density- and momentum dependent cdm3yn interaction determined from the extended hf study of nm @xcite to be compliant with the hvh theorem .",
    "the extended dfm is applied to study in details the impact of the rearrangement effect of the nuclear mean field in the optical model analysis of the elastic , refractive and scattering at different energies .",
    "we recall here the ( nonrelativistic ) hartree - fock description of homogeneous and symmetric nm at the given nucleon density @xmath2 . given the direct ( @xmath3 ) and exchange ( @xmath4 ) parts of the ( central ) effective nn interaction @xmath5 , the ground - state energy of nm is @xmath6 , where the kinetic and potential energies are determined as @xmath7 here the single - particle wave function @xmath8 is plane wave .",
    "the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath9 in the spin - saturated , symmetric nm is a step function determined with the fermi momentum @xmath10 as @xmath11 according to the landau theory for infinite fermi systems @xcite , the single - particle energy @xmath12 at the given nucleon density @xmath2 is determined as @xmath13 which is the change of the nm energy caused by the removal or addition of a nucleon with the momentum @xmath14 .",
    "the single - particle potential @xmath15 consists of both the hf and rearrangement terms @xmath16 it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ ek4 ] ) and ( [ uk2 ] ) that the rt accounts for the rearrangement of the nuclear mean field due to the removal or addition of a nucleon @xcite . when the nucleon momentum approaches the fermi momentum @xmath17 determined from eqs .",

    "we use two density dependent versions ( cdm3y3 and cdm3y6 ) @xcite of the m3y interaction based on the g - matrix elements of paris potential in a oscillator basis @xcite .",
    "thus , the central cdm3yn interaction is determined explicitly as @xmath23 the radial part of the interaction @xmath24 is kept unchanged as determined from the spin- and isospin independent part of the m3y - paris interaction @xcite , in terms of three yukawas @xmath25 the density dependence of the interaction ( [ cdm3y ] ) was assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite as a hybrid of the exponential and power - law forms in order to obtain different values of the nuclear incompressibility @xmath26 in relatively small ( 10 to 20 mev ) steps from the hf calculation of nm . given this empirical choice of @xmath27 , a realistic range for the @xmath26 value ( the most vital input for the equation of state of cold nm ) has been deduced accurately from the folding model analysis of the refractive @xmath28-nucleus and scattering ( see details in the review @xcite ) .",

    "a more comprehensive hf study of the nucleon mean - field potential in asymmetric nm has been performed recently @xcite , taking into account also the isospin dependent part of the cdm3yn interaction . in the dfm calculation of the optical potential , the isospin dependent part of the effective nn interaction",
    "is needed only if both nuclei have nonzero isospins in their ground states @xcite . in the present study we have focused , therefore , on the extension of the dfm using the spin- and isospin independent interaction ( [ cdm3y ] ) only .    )",
    "-([ek2 ] ) , using the cdm3y3 and cdm3y6 interactions ( [ cdm3y ] ) .",

    "these interactions , especially the cdm3y6 version , have been widely tested in the folding model analyses of the elastic nucleus - nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "the hf results for the ground - state energy of symmetric nm are shown in fig .",
    "one can see that at high nm densities the @xmath35 curve obtained with the cdm3y6 interaction is stiffer than that obtained with the cdm3y3 interaction , and this is due to the higher value of the nuclear incompressibility @xmath26 given by the cdm3y6 interaction .    [",

    "mev , the first and second airy minima are still visible in the measured data . the inspection of the far - side scattering cross section , especially that with a weaker absorptive strength of the imaginary op , has shown that a1 is moved from @xmath37 at 230 mev to the c.m .",

    "was suggested by ogloblin _",
    "@xcite to accommodate one more shallow airy minimum in the system at large angles .",
    "however , such an airy oscillation pattern could not consistently fit in the airy structure established for this same system at lower energies or other refractive systems like as discussed above in fig .",
    "[ fcc2 ] or @xcite .",
    "an interesting scenario for the backward rise of the elastic cross section at these energies has been suggested recently by ohkubo _",
    "_ @xcite as due to a strong coupling of the elastic scattering to the inelastic 2@xmath42 and 3@xmath43 excitations of the @xmath44c target .",
    "this important effect should be further checked by using other realistic choices of the op and inelastic scattering potential for the system .",
    "in particular , the elastic and inelastic folded potentials obtained in the present extended dfm that properly takes the rt into account should be a good choice for such a study . at the higher energies of @xmath45 and 1503 mev the first airy minimum a1 is well hidden in the forward angles , where only the fraunhofer oscillation of the elastic cross section caused by the near - far interference @xcite is visible in the measured data . nevertheless , the large - angle exponential fall - off of the elastic cross section measured at these high energies is still dominated by the far - side scattering , and that has allowed us to determine the strength of the real folded ( via @xmath46 renormalization factor ) quite accurately .    , where @xmath47 is the relative - motion momentum ( [ ef4 ] ) .",

[ f4].,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    from the results of our detailed om analysis of the elastic scattering at energies up to 94 mev / nucleon presented in table  [ toc ]",
    "one can see that the extended dfm accounts quite well for the energy dependence of the real op . at energies up to 21 mev / nucleon , the best fit to the elastic data has been achieved with the cdm3y3 folded hf potential renormalized by the factor @xmath50 , while the best - fit renormalization factor of the folded hf+rt potential is @xmath51 . however , at the higher energies of 38 and 94 mev / nucleon , the best - fit renormalization factor of the folded hf potential becomes @xmath52 .",
    "given a realistic ( mean - field based ) energy dependence of the cdm3yn interaction in terms of the @xmath48 factor used in the extended dfm calculation ( [ ef4])-([ef5 ] ) , the best - fit renormalization factor of the real folded hf+rt potential remains close to unity at high energies ( @xmath53 and 1.02 at the energies of 38 and 94 mev / nucleon , respectively ) .",
    "about the same trend was found with the best - fit @xmath46 factors given by the real cdm3y6 folded potential , which are about 3 - 5% larger than those obtained with the real cdm3y3 folded potential . as discussed above in sec .",
    "[ scc ] , this effect is associated with a higher nuclear incompressibility given by the cdm3y6 interaction that leads to a more repulsion in the real folded potential at small radii . to illustrate the local energy dependence @xmath48 of the cdm3y3 interaction used in the extended dfm calculation ( [ ef5 ] ) of the potential , we have plotted the local ( energy dependent ) nucleon momentum @xmath54 and the corresponding @xmath48 factor in the upper and lower parts of fig .",
    "[ foc6 ] , respectively .",
    "one can see that at low energies the real folded potential is deep at small distances @xmath55 , so that the corresponding local relative - motion momentum @xmath47 [ see eq .",
    "( [ ef4 ] ) ] or the average nucleon momentum @xmath56 is significantly higher at small @xmath55 compared to its asymptotic value at large @xmath55 .",
    "the larger @xmath47 value implies a quicker oscillation of the relative - motion wave function , and the deep real folded potential at low energies , as shown by kondo _",
    "@xcite , usually generates the partial - wave radial functions having the numbers of nodes precisely as required by the pauli principle when the dinuclear system is antisymmetrized .",
    "the local @xmath48 factor ( see lower part of fig .",
    "[ foc6 ] ) was consistently interpolated from the explicit momentum dependence @xmath49 of the nucleon op in nm shown in fig",
    ".  [ f4 ] , and it represents , therefore , the mean - field based energy dependence of the cdm3yn interaction used in the extended dfm calculation of the potential . at low energies ( @xmath57 mev / nucleon )",
    "when @xmath58 @xmath59 , the @xmath48 factors remain close to unity .",
    "at the high energy of 94 mev / nucleon , the @xmath54 value is increased to above 2 @xmath59 over the whole radial range ( see upper part of fig .  [ foc6 ] ) so that the corresponding @xmath48 factor is reduced significantly ( see lower part of fig .",
    "[ foc6 ] ) .",
    "thus , the consistent treatment of the mean - field based energy dependence of the cdm3yn interaction via @xmath48 factor helps to improve the predicting power of the real folded potential .",
    "the cdm3y3 and cdm3y6 density dependent versions of the m3y - paris interaction have been used in an extended hf study of symmetric nm , focusing on the rearrangement term of the single - nucleon potential that appears naturally when the hugenholtz - van hove theorem is taken into account in the calculation of the single - nucleon energy .",
    "based on the exact expression of the rt of the density dependent single - nucleon potential given by the hvh theorem and the empirical energy dependence of the nucleon op , a compact method has been proposed to account properly for the density- and energy dependence of the rt of the nucleon op in nm on the hf level .    given an explicit contribution of the rt added to the density dependence of the cdm3yn interaction and proper treatment of the momentum dependence of the nucleon mean - field potential in nm on the hf level , the double - folding model has been extended to take into account consistently the rearrangement effect in the dfm calculation of the op in the same mean - field manner .",
    "the contribution of the rt to the total folded potential has been shown to be repulsive and particularly strong at small internuclear distances .",
    "this result is complimentary to the recent dfm calculation of the op using a g - matrix interaction that includes effectively the three - body force @xcite .",
    "in fact , the microscopic origin of the rt was shown in the bhf study of nm @xcite to be due to the higher - order diagram in the perturbative expansion of the mass operator and the contribution of the three - body force .",
    "the present extension of the dfm is an important milestone that allows us to obtain the realistic shape and strength of the real folded op at small internuclear distances , which match closely those implied by the detailed om analysis of the elastic and scattering data measured at the refractive energies .",
    "the realistic treatment of the ( mean - field based ) energy dependence of the cdm3yn interaction in the extended dfm calculation significantly improves the predicting power of the real folded potential , especially , in the proper description of the airy structure of the nuclear rainbow pattern observed in the elastic and scattering .",
    "all parameters of the modified density dependence of the cdm3yn interaction that takes into account the correction by the rt and the mean - field based energy dependence are given in such details that the interested readers could easily include these parameters into their folding model calculation .",
    "the present development of the dfm for the op can be generalized and applied further in the folding model study of the inelastic scattering @xcite , to reveal , in particular , the impact of the rearrangement effect caused by the nuclear excitation .",

    "<S> realistic density dependent cdm3yn versions of the m3y interaction have been used in an extended hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation of nuclear matter ( nm ) , with the nucleon single - particle potential determined from the total nm energy based on the hugenholtz - van hove theorem that gives rise naturally to a rearrangement term ( rt ) . using the rt of the single - nucleon potential obtained exactly at different nm densities , the density- and energy dependence of the cdm3yn interactions was modified to account properly for both the rt and observed energy dependence of the nucleon optical potential . </S>",
    "<S> based on a local density approximation , the double - folding model of the optical potential has been extended to take into account consistently the rearrangement effect and energy dependence of the nuclear mean - field potential , using the modified cdm3yn interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the extended double - folding model was applied to study the elastic and scattering at the refractive energies , where the airy structure of the nuclear rainbow has been well established . </S>",
    "<S> the rt was found to affect significantly the real optical potential at small internuclear distances , giving the potential strength close to that implied by the realistic optical model description of the airy oscillation . </S>"
