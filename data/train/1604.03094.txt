    ", it becomes necessary to account for losses and dissipation in matter .",
    "however it has proven difficult to construct a theory that accounts for the effects of dispersion and dissipation in systems where quantum mechanical behaviour is important ; e.g. the casimir effect  @xcite , quantum friction  @xcite , or even analogues of hawking radiation  @xcite .",

    "we shall apply the theory presented in @xcite , which is a generalization of the huttner ",

    "the usual frequency domain constitutive equations @xmath2 and @xmath3 are recovered from the equations of motion , with the relative permittivity @xmath4 and permeability @xmath5 obeying the kramers - kronig relations  @xcite .",
    "one of the significant consequences of this theory ( which was also pointed out earlier by huttner and barnett  @xcite ) , is that the excitations of the electromagnetic field and medium are strongly coupled so that one must work in terms of _ polaritons _ instead of photons : unlike photons these quanta have no set relationship between their frequency @xmath6 and wave  vector @xmath7 .",
    "we note that the theory was initially developed for isotropic stationary media , but can be generalised to bianisotropic and moving media @xcite .    here",
    "we shall explore the effects of the motion of a material and the time dependence of its properties on the excitation of the system when it is initially prepared in the ground state .",
    "although such dynamic casimir type effects have been studied before  @xcite , one typically does not include the effects of dispersion and dissipation , which we include here within the full generality of the formalism of macroscopic qed .",
    "our analysis predicts the excitation rate of polaritons within the material as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and can be applied to any material so long as the permittivity and permeability satisfy the kramers  kronig relations .",
    "the excitations we find do not obey a dispersion relation , but they each possess a time dependent electric field able to excite a detector embedded within the material .",
    "they also produce radiation that could be measured by a photon detector placed outside of the material , although we do not calculate this process here .    in the first section of this paper",
    "we explore the classical lagrangian and hamiltonian necessary to describe a dispersive , lossy dielectric that has time dependent properties , or is in motion .",
    "we briefly show that in both cases ( see figure [ fig : system ] ) the effects of motion or time dependence can be subsumed within new effective material susceptibilities . using time ",
    "dependent perturbation theory , we then calculate the excitation rate of pairs of polaritons due to the time dependence or motion of the medium .",
    "we find that from the perspective of macroscopic qed time dependent material properties and material motion contribute separately to the hamiltonian , even though one would expect a moving spatial distribution of permittivity to be indistinguishable from a moving medium . after developing the general theory",
    "we treat three illustrative cases ( see figure  [ fig : system ] ) : ( a ) an infinite homogeneous medium performing a linear oscillatory motion ; ( b ) an infinite homogeneous medium where the permittivity oscillates in time ; and ( c ) a ` bump ' in the permittivity moving uniformly through an otherwise homogeneous dielectric . the final example is inspired by the recent optical experiments investigating laboratory analogues of hawking radiation  @xcite .     around a fixed position ; b ) the permittivity of a uniform medium oscillates around a fixed value , @xmath8 ; c ) a spatially dependent change to the permittivity @xmath9 , moves at a constant velocity @xmath10 through an otherwise uniform medium of permittivity @xmath11 , emitting radiation as it moves . to calculate the emission rates we apply time dependent perturbation theory to macroscopic qed  @xcite.[fig : system],height=151 ]",
    "in this section we construct the classical theory of the electromagnetic field interacting with a moving or time dependent material that exhibits dispersion and dissipation .",
    "the lagrangian of @xcite is extended in a similar fashion to  @xcite , in this case accounting for non - relativistic motion and an arbitrary time dependence of the permittivity profile .",
    "the dynamical variables of the electromagnetic field are the vector potential @xmath12 and the scalar potential @xmath13 , which are related to the electric and magnetic field strengths by @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the dissipation of electromagnetic energy is governed by the coupling of the electromagnetic field to a field of simple harmonic oscillators @xmath16 present throughout space , with every possible natural frequency @xmath6 . the lagrangian density for our system is given by    @xmath17 \\end{split}\\ ] ]    and is valid to first order in the velocity @xmath18 of the material , which at this point we allow to be spatially dependent .",
    "for simplicity we have set @xmath19 throughout , which amounts to ignoring the second oscillator bath that appears in  @xcite , although this can be re  introduced with no fundamental modifications to our results .",
    "the coupling between the field of oscillators and the electromagnetic field is mediated via a term that is proportional to a quantity @xmath20 which in this case is a scalar quantity that depends on space , time and frequency . the second coupling term @xmath21 is given in terms of @xmath20 by @xmath22 , and is due to the lorentz transformation of the field strengths between reference frames ( a phenomenon we shall often refer to as polarization mixing ) . here",

    "pairs of polaritons can be emitted with the total energy of the pair @xmath246 coming from the motion .",
    "we have found that so long as energy and momentum are conserved and the energy of both polaritons is positive , there is always some excitation in the material .",
    "however , this is typically very small unless the wave  vectors and frequencies are close to either a material resonance , or to fulfilling the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves .",
    "the emission from a moving perturbation is of exactly the same form , and from the perspective of the perturbation theory comes from the same ` dynamic casimir ' term ( [ secondterm ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that in this case the energy available for the creation of excitations instead comes from the frequencies @xmath247 within the moving perturbation , the @xmath90 dependence of which complicates the functional form of the emission spectral density .",
    "the motivation behind this calculation was to understand the effects of the time dependence and motion of dielectric media on the excitations of polaritons ( i.e. the normal modes of light and matter ) , when the effects of dissipation and dispersion are fully taken into account .",
    "in particular we analysed the necessary modifications to the hamiltonian of macroscopic qed that must be made to describe the motion and time dependence of a dielectric , and applied this to calculate the polariton excitation rate in the three illustrative cases summarized in figure  [ fig : system ] . before calculating this emission rate",
    "we briefly discussed that the distinct effect of motion versus time dependence is to introduce non - locality into the permittivity . in the case of uniform translational motion",
    "this non - locality is simply the well  known doppler shift of the frequency dispersion , but that for more complicated motion becomes increasingly intricate .",
    "having found the separate modifications to the hamiltonian of macroscopic qed necessary to describe moving or time dependent dielectric media , we applied time dependent perturbation theory to calculate the emission rate of polaritons in three particular cases .",
    "in general we found that so long as the energies of both polaritons are positive , and energy and momentum are conserved then there is always some  albeit often very small  excitation rate . for a uniform medium performing an oscillatory motion , or material properties that oscillate in time with angular frequency @xmath82 , energy conservation demands that the total energy of the pair equals @xmath246 .",
    "for a material with a single resonance at @xmath139 this means that there will be a peak in the emission ( although not the only peak ) when e.g. one of the pair has frequency @xmath139 and wave ",
    "vector @xmath90 , and the other has frequency @xmath175 and wave ",
    "vector @xmath191 where @xmath248 is very large ( i.e. close to fulfilling the dispersion relation ) .",
    "experimentally it might be of particular importance that in all the cases we examined , the regions where the polaritons both nearly fulfil the dispersion relation and are close to a material resonance contribute most to the emission .",
    "the final example we considered was the emission of polariton pairs from a uniformly moving perturbation to the permittivity of a medium .",
    "we found that the description of this process is not fundamentally different from that of emission from a uniform time oscillating permittivity .",
    "the main difference is that rather than take energy @xmath246 from the oscillation of the material properties , the polaritons take energy @xmath249 from the motion of the perturbation .",
    "vector dependence of the energy makes the emission increase with spatially sharper perturbations , and typically causes the polaritons to be emitted in cones .",
    "however , the peak emission is still concentrated around the regions where the frequencies where one of the pairs is close to a material resonance , and the other is close to fulfilling the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves , where both are at resonances , or where both are close to fulfilling the dispersion relation .",
