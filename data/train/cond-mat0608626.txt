    "distribution of charges in ionic systems has been a subject of considerable interest for many years . in theoretical studies of systems such as molten salts , electrolytes or ionic liquids the interaction potential",
    "is often approximated by the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) , where identical hard spheres carry positive or negative charges with equal magnitude .",
    "earlier studies concentrated on correlation functions for charges in ion - dilute systems @xcite , and later the ion - dense systems were also investigated  @xcite .",
    "however , the question of the form of the correlation functions in the liquid ( fused salt ) at the coexistence with the ionic crystal remain open . whereas the correlation functions in a liquid can be quite accurately described within liquid theories such as the mean - spherical approximation ( msa )  @xcite , the transition to a crystalline phase",
    "is not predicted by the liquid theories .",
    "the liquid - solid transition in the rpm was determined within the density functional theory of freezing in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the charge - charge correlation function is not discussed in this work . both the phase transition and the correlation functions can be found on the same level of approximation within the framework of the field theory for the rpm introduced in ref.@xcite . in this work",
    "we calculate the correlation functions in the rpm by applying the brazowskii - type approximation .",
    "we pay particular attention to the decay length , the period of damped oscillations and the amplitude along the phase coexistence with an ionic crystal that was recently found in ref .",
    "the behavior of the charge - charge correlation function @xmath3 depends on thermodynamic conditions . in fig.1",
    "a portion of the density - temperature phase diagram , as obtained in different theoretical  @xcite and simulation  @xcite studies , is shown schematically .",
    "the solid lines represent boundaries of stability of the uniform fluid phase , and regions corresponding to different qualitative properties of @xmath3 are separated by the dashed lines .",
    "the kirkwood line ( k ) separates the high - temperature / low - density region corresponding to an asymptotic monotonic decay of correlations , from the low - temperature / high - density region corresponding to exponentially damped oscillatory behavior of @xmath3 . in theories of the mean - field ( mf ) type the kirkwood line is found to be a straight line @xmath4 , where @xmath5 in the above @xmath6 is the dimensionless number - density ( volume measured in @xmath7 units , where @xmath8 is the ion - diameter ) , and @xmath9 is the temperature in standard reduced units ( @xmath10 is the dielectric constant of the solvent and @xmath11 is the charge ) . in different theories the value of @xmath12 is somewhat different , and typically @xmath13 .",
    "there is no controversy concerning this line , but there are no general reasons for this line to be straight beyond mf  @xcite .",
    " represent the kirkwood line and the @xmath0-line respectively . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are in arbitrary units . ]",
    "when the @xmath0-line is approached from the high - temperature side , the decay vent of correlations diverges  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the correlation function diverges  @xcite as well on the mf level of the field theory  @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature side of this line corresponds to a charge - ordered structure , where the nearest - neighbors ( nn ) are oppositely charged , and the @xmath0-line represents a continuous transition between the uniform and the charge - ordered phases .",
    "the slope of this line shows a strong dependence on approximations and assumptions made in different theories  @xcite . in particular , in the mf approximation for the field theory the @xmath0-line is @xmath16  @xcite , whereas the msa yields @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the charge - ordered liquid phase was observed neither experimentally nor in simulations .",
    "a natural conclusion would be to question validity of theories that predict the existence of the @xmath0-line .",
    "however , the @xmath0-line of continuous transitions to the charge - ordered phase was observed in simulations  @xcite of the lattice version of the rpm ( lrpm ) , in agreement with predictions of the lattice version of the field theory  @xcite .",
    "some other theories  @xcite yield for the lrpm similar results .",
    "the msa , however , predicts an absence of such a transition in the lrpm .",
    "one might argue that the msa theories are correct only in the continuum space , and the field theory yields correct results only on the lattice .",
    "this is indeed the case for the field theory in the mf approximation .",
    "beyond mf , with the charge fluctuations accounted for in a brazovskii - type approximation  @xcite , the decay length of the charge - charge correlation function is found to be finite in the continuum - space rpm  @xcite .",
    "thus , when the fluctuations are included in the field theory , there is no line of continuous transitions , in agreement with the msa . at the same time",
    "the first - order transition to the ionic crystal is found  @xcite for the range of densities and temperatures that agree with simulations  @xcite .",
    "thus , within the field theory we can calculate the correlation functions at the coexistence with the ionic crystal .",
    "the field - theory results  @xcite also shed light on the nature of the @xmath0-line that appears in mf . beyond the kirkwood line",
    "there is no qualitative change of the _ average _ structure of the liquid phase , which is represented by the correlation function . on the other hand ,",
    "the line @xmath18 separates the phase diagram @xmath19 into two regions that correspond to different forms of the _ most probable _ instantaneous distributions of ions . at the high - temperature side of the line @xmath20",
    "the distribution of ions is most probably random . for @xmath21 , however , the most probable instantaneous distributions of the ions correspond to charge - density waves with a wavelength @xmath22 , where @xmath8 is the hard - sphere diameter . according to the above prediction , in real - space representation charge - ordered clusters with a nn distance",
    "@xmath23 should dominate over randomly distributed ions for @xmath21 in instantaneous charge distributions ( i.e. in microscopic states ) .",
    "such structures were indeed seen in simulation snapshots  @xcite . in mf the average density distributions are approximated by the most probable distributions .",
    "when in a particular system the average- and the most - probable distributions agree on a qualitative level , the mf results are qualitatively correct .",
    "this is not the case in the rpm , therefore the line @xmath20 is erroneously interpreted as a line of continuous phase transitions in mf theories . on the other hand ,",
    "the occurrence of the @xmath0-line on the mf level is an indication of the first - order transition to the ionic crystal , because beyond mf the first - order transition is found in the phase - space region where the charge - ordered individual microstates are more probable than the microstates with randomly distributed ions .    in this work",
    "we focus mainly on the charge - charge correlations for @xmath21 , and calculate the number - number correlation function as well . in ref.@xcite the correlation functions are calculated within the field - theoretic description developed in ref.@xcite only in the gaussian approximation . as already mentioned , at the @xmath0-line the decay length and the amplitude of the charge - charge correlation function both diverge .",
    "our purpose is to verify if the instantaneous order has some effect on the correlation functions beyond the gaussian approximation .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are extended beyond the gaussian approximation within the brazovskii theory  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that at the coexistence with the ionic crystal , obtained in ref.@xcite , the amplitude and the decay length are quite small .",
    "our results show that large decay length and amplitude of the charge - charge correlation function can be found only in the metastable liquid .",

    "note that the form of @xmath233 is the same along the phase coexistence , for a large range of density .",
    "this result is consistent with the structure of the ionic crystal coexisting with the liquid , where the nn distance is also independent of density on the same level of approximation .",
    "this result reflects the fact that the tendency for ordering in periodic structure follows directly form the form of the coulomb potential .",
    "the number - density correlation function is shown in fig.9 .",
    "in our theory the contribution to the correlation functions associated with hard - sphere ordering is neglected . the number - density correlation function shown in fig.9 results from the coupling between the number- and the charge - density fluctuations , and",
    "is induced by the charge - ordering , which in turn follows from the form of the interaction potential .",
    "the exact form of the number - density correlation function should contain the entropic contribution due to the hard - spheres ordering , in addition to the interaction - induced contribution shown in fig.9 .",
    "in this work the fluctuation contribution to the charge- and number - density correlation functions in the rpm is calculated within the brazovskii - type theory . in mf the amplitude and the correlation length both diverge when the @xmath0-line is approached . at the low - temperature side of the @xmath0-line an instantaneous order",
    "occurs in the majority of the individual microscopic states , i.a .",
    "clusters with oppositely charged nn dominate over randomly distributed ions . averaging over microscopic states with somewhat different order leads to a homogeneization of the structure downhomogenizationtion - induced first - order transition to the ionic crystal .",
    "our purpose here was a verification if the instantaneous order found on the low-@xmath14 side of the @xmath0-line leaves some traces in the correlation functions .",
    "our results show that the correlation length and the amplitude of @xmath208 , both divergent in mf at the @xmath0-line , show no indication of the mf singularity when the fluctuation contribution is included .",
    "both quantities are of order of unity in the whole stability region of the fluid phase .",
