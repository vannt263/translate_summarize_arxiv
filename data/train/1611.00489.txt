    "the magnetic field geometry of a fusion device is given by the external coil system and the plasma current .",
    "one of the advantages of stellarator / heliotron configuration compared to axisymmetric tokamaks is that plasma current is not necessary to sustain the confinement magnetic field .",
    "however , owing to the geometry , the helical ripple enhances the neoclassical radial particle and energy transport .",
    "therefore , optimization of the field geometry is required for minimizing the neoclassical transport together with stabilizing the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equilibrium and improving the fast particle confinement.@xcite the future fusion device will be operated in the higher - beta and higher - temperature condition compared to that in the present experimental devices .",
    "in such a collisionless and high pressure gradient plasma , the neoclassical bootstrap current is supposed to increase enough to interact with the mhd equilibrium .",
    "a self - consistent algorithm is required to investigate both the optimization of the neoclassical transport and the mhd equilibrium .",
    "the algorithm must satisfy both the efficiency and the accuracy in order to evaluate a quantitative study for the design of a fusion reactor .    from this viewpoint ,",
    "neoclassical transport in helical plasmas has been investigated by transport codes based on several local approximations , for example , dkes@xcite @xcite , gsrake@xcite , euterpe@xcite , and neo-2@xcite et al .",

    "@xcite in the local models , the tangential grad - b and curvature drift on the flux surfaces is often assumed to be negligibly small compared to the parallel motion and @xmath3 drift .",
    "further , the mono - energy assumption is sometimes employed in the local neoclassical codes , in which the momentum conservation of the collision operator is broken because the lorentz pitch - angle scattering operator is adopted .",
    "note that momentum correction techniques by taguchi@xcite , sugama - nishimura@xcite@xcite@xcite , and maaberg@xcite have been devised to recover the parallel momentum balance .",
    "several benchmarks have shown that the momentum correction affects the quantitative accuracy of neoclassical transport calculations in helical plasmas@xcite@xcite , especially in the quasi - axisymmetric hsx plasma.@xcite@xcite    the recent studies indicate the contribution of the magnetic tangential drift@xcite@xcite @xcite in the evaluation of radial neoclassical transport when the @xmath5 drift velocity is slower than the magnetic drift .",
    "matsuoka@xcite has devised a way to include the tangential magnetic drift in the local drift - kinetic equation solver .",
    "there are also some global neoclassical codes which treat the full 3-dimensional guiding - center motion including both the radial and tangential magnetic drift term .",
    "however , only a few global neoclassical codes have been applied on helical plasmas.@xcite@xcite@xcite compared with the local codes , the global codes are stricter solutions to evaluate the drift - kinetic equation with the finite magnetic drift effect , but it takes more computational resources than the local codes .",
    "therefore , it is almost impossible to utilize the global codes to investigate the interaction between bootstrap current and mhd equilibrium because it requires iterations between neoclassical transport and mhd simulations .",
    "the local approximations are appropriate for the purpose , but this has not been thoroughly verified among the neoclassical local models with global ones to guarantee the quantitative reliability of the neoclassical radial flux and parallel flow obtained from these local drift - kinetic models .    in this paper , following the previous study by matsuoka@xcite , the neoclassical transport is examined with four types of neoclassical transport codes in large helical device(lhd ) , helically symmetric experiment(hsx ) , and wendelstein 7-x(w7-x ) .",

    "the magnetic drift term is treated as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a flux - surface label and @xmath10 .",
    "local _ indicates the neglect of radial drift in the guiding - center equation of motion .",
    "therefore , the zow model becomes a 4-dimensional model and reduces computational resources .",

    "first , according to the simulations , the tangential magnetic drift @xmath291 is more obvious in lhd than w7-x and hsx . in w7-x and hsx ,",
    "the magnetic configuration is chosen so as to reduce the radial drift of trapped particles and remains the neoclassical transport in @xmath292-regime .",
    "this reduces the peak value of @xmath293 at the poloidal resonance , @xmath294 in eq . , and results in the small gap between the zmd and the zow models in these machines compared to lhd .",

    "this suggests that the conventional local drift - kinetic models are sufficient for electron simulation .",
    "the difference in the treatment of the @xmath5 drift term has also been found to cause a large error in neoclassical transport calculation .",
    "the assumption of incompressible @xmath295 drift in the dkes - like model results in the miscalculation of the neoclassical transport for the larger poloidal mach number of @xmath296 . due to the mass dependency of @xmath297 , the heavier ion @xmath298 such as he and w increases .",
    "therefore , the parameter window in which the incompressible-@xmath5 approximation is valid will be narrower for heavier species .    regarding the practical application ,",

    "the radial dependence of the helical component is approximated as @xmath309 according to the tendency found in the mhd equilibrium for lhd plasma . in eq .",
    ", @xmath310 is chosen because this is the bottom position of both toroidal and helical ripples . substituting the parameters @xmath311 , and @xmath312 for the lhd case , the shift of the @xmath293-peak is estimated as @xmath313 at which poloidal resonance @xmath294 occurs .",

    "the strength of the source - sink term is proportional to @xmath320 and @xmath319 so that the users do not have to control the strength of the source - sink term .",
    "third , the source / sink term does not contribute as a parallel momentum source as shown in eq . , because the steady - state parallel momentum balance can be found without giving an artificial source / sink term .    in the drift - kinetic equation for @xmath315 , the source - sink term @xmath145 , which satisfies the conditions explained above ,",
    "is given in the form @xmath323 with the following constraints : @xmath324 where @xmath325 is a numerical factor to control the strength of the adaptive source - sink term .",

    "the field - particle operator is made so as to satisfy the following conservation laws for the like - particle linearized collision term@xcite , @xmath327 by comparing eqs . and , one can see that operator @xmath129 can be directly used to implement the source / sink term . in fortec-3d , the source / sink term is operated in the @xmath328 cells on a flux - surface which is the same as those prepared for the collision terms . in this simulation ,",
    "@xmath329 cells on a @xmath328-plane are employed .",

    "<S> the benchmarks of the neoclassical transport codes based on the several local drift - kinetic models are reported here . here , the drift - kinetic models are zow , zmd , dkes - like , and global , as classified in [ matsuoka et al . , </S>",

    "<S> it is found that the assumption of @xmath0 incompressibility causes discrepancy of neoclassical radial flux and parallel flow among the models when @xmath0 is sufficiently large compared to the magnetic drift velocities . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the poloidal mach number . on the other hand , when @xmath3 and the magnetic drift velocities are comparable , the tangential magnetic drift , which is included in both the global and zow models , fills the role of suppressing unphysical peaking of neoclassical radial - fluxes found in the other local models at @xmath4 . in low collisionality plasmas , </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the tangential drift effect works well to suppress such unphysical behavior of the radial transport caused in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the zow model has the advantage of mitigating the unphysical behavior in the several magnetic geometries , and that it also implements evaluation of bootstrap current in lhd with the low computation cost compared to the global model . </S>"
