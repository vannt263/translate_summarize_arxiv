    "there is now strong evidence that the high - energy emission observed in blazars , microquasars , and @xmath0-ray bursts originates from collimated , relativistic outflows .",
    "the common view is that those outflows are powered by a magnetized accretion disk and a spinning black hole and collimated by magnetic fields and/or the medium surrounding the jet .",
    "however , there is as yet no universal agreement about the mechanisms responsible for the formation and acceleration the jet and the dissipation of its bulk energy .",
    "even the composition of the jet is unknown in most sources .",
    "the rapid variability frequently observed suggests that the high - energy emission is likely to be produced close to the inner engine and , therefore , provides an important probe of the physics involved on those scales .",
    "as discussed below , some important constraints on the jet parameters can already be imposed using available data , and further progress is expected in the coming few years with the advance of observational techniques .",
    "a new generation of experiments just started operating or will become operative soon : space - based ( e.g. glast , integral , agile ) , cerenkov ( e.g. hess , magic , veritas ) , and air - shower ( e.g. milagro ) @xmath0-ray detectors will probe with high sensitivity the energy range of 10  mev to a few tev ( see , e.g. , catanese , 1999 for a review ) .",
    "the operating baikal and amanda neutrino telescopes , and the cubic - km scale telescopes under construction ( icecube , antares , nestor , nemo ; see , e.g. halzen , 2005 for review ) , will open a new window onto the universe . besides providing an important probe of the innermost regions of compact astrophysical systems ,",
    "these experiments can also be exploited to test new physics .",
    "finally , new ultra - high - energy cosmic - ray detectors , e.g. the hires and the hybrid auger detectors will provide cosmic - ray data of unprecedented quality and quantity .",
    "at sufficiently small radii the _ compactness parameter _ , @xmath2 , largely exceeds unity for essentially all classes of compact high - energy sources .",
    "it is , therefore , expected that @xmath0-rays will not be able to escape from the inner jet regions without creating pairs .",
    "both the synchrotron photons produced inside the jet and the ambient radiation intercepted by the jet contribute an opacity to pair production .",
    "the threshold @xmath0-ray energy for pair production via interaction with a target photon of energy @xmath3 is @xmath4 consequently , for a target photon spectrum @xmath5 with @xmath6 the @xmath0-ray opacity at a given radius should increase with increasing @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "results of detailed calculations of the @xmath0-ray opacity are exhibited in figure 1 , where the _ @xmath0-spheric radius _",
    ", defined as the radius @xmath7 beyond which the pair production optical depth to infinity is unity , viz . , @xmath8 ,",
    "is plotted against @xmath0-ray energy @xmath9 , for two target radiation fields : synchrotron radiation ( dashed lines ) and external radiation ( solid lines ) .",
    "the spectra of the target radiation fields employed in those calculations are discussed in levinson ( 2006 ) .",
    "as seen the @xmath0-spheric radius indeed increases with increasing @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "the @xmath0-spheres can be mapped in principle by measuring temporal variations of the @xmath0-ray flux in different energy bands during a flare .",
    "if the @xmath0-ray emission is produced over many octaves of jet radius , where intense pair cascades at the observed energies are important ( blandford & levinson 1995 ) , then it is expected that a flare will propagate from low to high energies , or that the variations at higher @xmath0-ray energy will be slower than at lower energies . with the limited sensitivity and energy band of the egret instrument it was practically impossible to resolve such effects .",
    "it is hoped that with the upcoming glast instrument this will be feasible    -spheric radius versus @xmath0-ray energy , computed using the target photon spectra from levinson ( 2006 ) .",
    "the different curves correspond to a different normalization of the target radiation field intensity.,width=491 ]    further constraints on the source parameters can be derived by measuring the low - energy flux ( radio - to - ir ) simultaneously with the variable @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "suppose that a variability timescale @xmath10 has been measured at some observed @xmath0-ray energy @xmath11 .",
    "this implies that the emission at the observed energy originated from a region of size ( as measured in the lab frame ) @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the bulk lorentz factor and the corresponding doppler factor of the emitting matter , respectively , and @xmath15 is the redshift of the source . above the emission region",
    "the pair production optical depth at the observed energy must not exceed unity , viz .",
    ", @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the radius at which the @xmath0-ray emitting region is located .",
    "assuming @xmath18 implies @xmath19 .",
    "suppose now that the synchrotron flux near the peak can be measured simultaneously .",
    "the latter condition on @xmath20 can be solved for the doppler factor to yield ( levinson 2006 ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the measured synchrotron flux density in janskys , @xmath23 is the opening angle of the jet and @xmath24 is @xmath10 measured in hours . adopting @xmath25",
    ", we estimate @xmath26 for the rapid flare observed in mrk 421 and @xmath27 for the few minuets variability reported for pks 2155 - 304 , with @xmath28 cm for the minimum condition in both sources .",
    "such high values of @xmath14 are in clear disagreement with the much lower values inferred from source statistics ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1991 ) and superluminal motions on parsec scales ( jorstad et al .",
    "various explanations , including jet deceleration ( georganopouloselta & kazanas 2003 ) , a structure consisting of interacting spine and sheath ( ghisellini et al . 2005 ) , and opening angle effects ( gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2004 ) have been proposed in order to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "alternatively , it is conceivable that those flares result from impulsive ejection episodes of high lorentz factor shells , like in the internal shock model of grbs .",
    "it has been argued that such high values of the doppler factor may not be required if the @xmath0-ray production region is located far from the black hole , at radii @xmath29 .",
    "however , the fraction of jet energy that can be tapped for production of @xmath0 rays in a region of size @xmath30 located at a radius @xmath17 is @xmath31 . as a consequence , either the opening angle of the jet is very small , @xmath32 or the jet power is much larger than the luminosity of the tev emission measured during the flaring states .",
    "another possibility is that the tev emission is produced by a converging shock in a reconfinement nozzle , as proposed for the hst1 knot in m87 ( cheung et al .",
    "it should be noted that in m87 the x - ray and tev luminosities are @xmath33 erg s@xmath34 ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ; cheung et al .",
    "2007 ) , much smaller than the tev luminosity @xmath35 erg s@xmath34 observed typically in the tev blazars .",
    "estimates of the jet power in m87 yield @xmath36 erg s@xmath34 ( e.g. , stawarz et al . 2006",
    "; bicknell & begelman 1996 ) , implying a very small conversion fraction , @xmath37 .",
    "even with such a small conversion efficiency an opening angle @xmath38 rad is required if the tev emission were to originate from the hst1 knot , unless reconfinement , as mentioned above , can give rise to convergence of the jet .",
    "this may occur if radiative cooling of the shocked jet layer is effective .",
    "recollimation shocks may be an important dissipation channel also in other sources , e.g. , grbs ( bromberg & levinson , 2007 )",
    "a substantial fraction of the energy dissipated in the jet can , in principle , be tapped for the acceleration of protons to ultrahigh energies with a power law spectrum .",
    "the maximum proton energy is limited by energy losses at small radii and by escape at larger radii ( levinson 2006 ) , and in any case is restricted to @xmath39 , where @xmath23 is the opening angle of the jet and @xmath40 the magnetic field . in terms of the equipartition parameter @xmath41 the magnetic field can be expressed as @xmath42 gauss , where @xmath43 is the jet power in eddington units and @xmath44 is the mass of the black hole in units of solar mass .",
    "consequently , production of uhecrs of observed energy @xmath45 requires @xmath46 which essentially leaves grbs with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and powerful blazars with @xmath50 , @xmath48 , @xmath51 as the main candidates for astrophysical uhecrs sources ) does not apply to vacuum gaps in dormant agns ( boldt & gosh 1999 ; levinson 2000 ) and magnetars where the ideal mhd condition is violated . ] whether protons can actually be accelerated by relativistic shocks to the highest energies observed is yet an open issue .",
    "high - energy neutrinos can be produced in astrophysical jets mainly through the decay of charged pions .",
    "the pions may be produced through collisions of protons with target photons ( @xmath52 ) , or via inelastic ( @xmath53 ) and ( @xmath54 ) collisions .",
    "the former process is usually dominant in jets ( for some exceptions see , levinson & eichler , 2003 ; torres & halzen , 2007 ) .    observations of vhe @xmath0-rays can constrain the photopion production opacity , particularly in situations where rapid variability of the vhe @xmath0-ray flux is observed . because both the protons and the @xmath0 rays interact locally with the same target radiation field the ratio of photomeson and pair production opacities depend solely on the ratio of cross sections , @xmath55 , and the spectrum of the target radiation field . for a target photon spectrum @xmath56",
    "this ratio reads @xmath57 detailed calculations of opacity ratios that employed more realistic target photon spectra are presented in levinson ( 2006 ) , and are plotted in fig .",
    "2 . as seen from the figure , at @xmath0-ray energies above a few tev the opacity ratio is smaller than unity even at the maximum proton energy . for the class of tev blazars this implies neutrino yields well below detection limit ( see levinson 2006 for more details ) . with glast",
    "it should be possible to constrain other sources and to use such constraints to identify the best candidates for the upcoming km@xmath58 detectors .",
    ", as a function of comoving proton energy @xmath59 at two radii : @xmath60 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath61 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the left panel corresponds to a choice of parameters that represents a typical blazar like 3c279 , and the right panel to a choice of parameters representing a typical microquasar like grs 1915 .",
    "the numbers that label the curves correspond to the comoving @xmath0-ray energy in units of tev .",
    "the dotted lines designate the maximum proton energy derived from the confinement limit.,width=529 ]    the neutrino flux emitted from the jet depends on several factors : ( i ) the fraction of jet energy injected as a power law distribution of protons @xmath62 , ( ii ) the spectrum of accelerated protons , ( iii ) the cooling times of pions and muons and ( iv ) the pion production opacity .",
    "it is customary to introduce the parameter @xmath63 , representing the fraction of proton energy @xmath64 converted to pions . in case of photopion production",
    "it can be approximated by @xmath65 $ ] , where @xmath66 is the elasticity . for a proton distribution",
    "@xmath67 the average fraction of proton energy lost to pions can be defined as @xmath68 this average fraction depends on the spectrum of both protons and target photons . for powerful blazars this fraction",
    "is estimated to be @xmath69 assuming a proton energy distribution @xmath70 , whereas for the tev bl lac sources @xmath71 ( levinson 2006 ) .",
    "the corresponding event rate in a km@xmath58 detector is @xmath72 yr@xmath34 for a powerful blazar at a redshift @xmath73 , and @xmath74 yr@xmath34 for mrk 421 and mrk 501 . in the case of microquasars up to a few events can be detected during a strong outburst if the viewing angle is sufficiently small ( levinson & waxman 2001 ; distefano et al .",
    "the estimated neutrino flux from grbs implies that only nearby sources can be individually detected by the upcoming experiments .",
    "however , the cumulative flux produced by the entire grb population should be detectable assuming that cosmological gebs are the sources of the observed uhecrs ( waxman & bahcall , 1997 ) .",
    "this requires that the rate of energy production of uhecrs in the energy interval @xmath75 ev is comparable to the rate of @xmath0-ray production by grbs in the batse band , @xmath76 erg mpc@xmath77 yr@xmath34 ( waxman 1995 ) .",
