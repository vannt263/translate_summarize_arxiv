    "fluid adsorption on micropatterned and sculpted solid substrates exhibit novel phase transitions compared to wetting behaviour at planar , homogeneous walls @xcite .",
    "the simple 3d wedge geometry has been extensively studied in the past decade theoretically @xcite , experimentally @xcite and by computer simulation @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic arguments @xcite show that the wedge is completely filled with liquid provided the contact angle @xmath0 is less than the tilt angle @xmath1 .",
    "these studies show that the conditions for continuous wedge filling transition are less restrictive than for critical wetting at planar walls @xcite .",
    "close to critical filling , the substrate geometry enhances interfacial fluctuations , which become highly anisotropic .",
    "we refer to these as breather modes excitations @xcite . however , most of these studies neglect the presence of a line tension associated with the wedge bottom .",
    "previous studies by the authors @xcite for short - ranged binding potentials show that the line tension may play an important role in filling phenomena and may drive the transition first - order if it exceeds a threshold value .",
    "we extend our analysis to arbitrary binding potentials , in particular to van der waals dispersive interactions .",
    "again , this shows that we can induce first - order filling by tailoring ( micro - patterning ) the substrate close to the wedge bottom .",
    "this may provide a practical means of reducing the fluctuation effects which would otherwise dominate any continuous filling transition .",
    "this finding may have technological implications for microfluidic devices .",
    "however , the borderline between first - order and critical filling depends on the specific range of the interactions . if the binding potential between the interface and the flat wall decays faster than @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the local interfacial height above the substrate , both regimes are separated by a tricritical point , as in the case of contact binding potentials @xcite . on the other hand , for longer - ranged binding potentials ,",
    "a critical end point separates the first - order and critical filling transitions .",
    "we note that these two situations correspond exactly to the fluctuation - dominated and mean - field regimes for critical filling @xcite .",
    "our paper is arranged as follows : in section ii we review briefly the phenomenology of wedge filling and introduce the breather mode interfacial model used in our study .",
    "the definition of the path integral used in our transfer matrix analysis is discussed in some detail . while other formalisms have been forwarded they suffer from a number of problems . as we shall show",
    "our definition is consistent with thermodynamic requirements ( exact sum - rules ) , generalized random walk arguments and also the predictions of conformal invariance .",
    "section iii is devoted to the analysis of wedge filling for contact binding potentials .",
    "some of these results have been previously reported , without derivation , in a brief communication @xcite .",
    "section iv extends the transfer matrix analysis to the important practical case of filling with long - ranged van der waals forces .",

    "after we assume the temperature defines the energy scale and set @xmath8 . to first approximation",
    "we may suppose that @xmath7 is independent of the position across the wedge section , i.e. @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the binding potential due to a single flat substrate .",
    "corrections may arise when the liquid adsorption is small enough however - a point we shall return to later .",
    "a mean - field analysis shows that locally the interface across the wedge is flat and that fluctuation effects are dominated by pseudo - one - dimensional local translations in the height of the filled region along the wedge ( the _ breather modes _ ) @xcite .",
    "fluctuation effects at filling can be studied by using an effective pseudo - one - dimensional wedge hamiltonian which accounts only for the breather - mode excitations @xcite : @xmath11=\\int d y\\left\\{\\frac{\\lambda(l)}{2 } \\left(\\frac{dl}{dy}\\right)^2 + v_w(l)\\right\\ } \\label{heff2}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the local height of the interface above the wedge bottom .",
    "the effective bending term @xmath13 resisting fluctuations along the wedge can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the line tension associated with the contact lines between the filled region and the substrate far from the wedge bottom .",
    "note that for large @xmath16 , we may neglect the @xmath15 contribution since @xmath13 is proportional to the local interfacial height .",
    "similarly , for large @xmath16 the effective binding potential @xmath17 takes the form @xcite : @xmath18 the first two terms corresponds to the bulk and surface thermodynamic contributions required to form the filled liquid region @xcite . here",
    "@xmath19 denotes the bulk ordering field measuring deviations from bulk two - phase coexistence , @xmath0 is the contact angle of the liquid drop at the planar wall - vapour interface and @xmath20 is the equilibrium liquid layer thickness for a single planar wall .",
    "the line tension @xmath15 is defined as above , and @xmath21 is the line tension associated with the wedge bottom .",
    "note that the line tension contributions are essentially independent of @xmath16 for @xmath22 , so they become irrelevant in that limit .",
    "finally , the last term corresponds to the binding potential contribution to @xmath23 . upon minimisation of @xmath17",
    ", we recover the mean - field expression for the mid - point height ( at bulk coexistence ) @xcite : @xmath24 however , we stress that the form ( [ effbinding ] ) for @xmath17 is only valid for @xmath25 . for @xmath26 , both @xmath13 and @xmath17 will behave in a different manner .",
    "furthermore , we may control the adsorption properties for small @xmath16 by micropatterning a stripe along the wedge bottom , so as to weaken the local wall - fluid intermolecular potential .",
    "the interfacial binding potential is consequently strengthened , and under some conditions it may bind the liquid - vapour interface to the wedge bottom even at the filling transition boundary @xmath27 .",
    "thus by introducing a line tension associated with the wedge bottom one may induce first - order filling in the modified wedge provided the modification is strong enough . as we shall see the lines of first - order and continuous filling transitions",
    "are separated by either a tricritical point or a critical end point depending on the range of the intermolecular forces .",
    "the quasi - one - dimensional character of the hamiltonian means it is amenable to a transfer - matrix analysis .",
    "the partition function corresponding to this hamiltonian can be expressed as the following path integral @xcite : @xmath28 )   \\label{partfunc}\\ ] ] however , the presence of a position - dependent stiffness coefficient makes the definition of the partition function ambiguous .",
    "this problem was pointed out , but not satisfactorily resolved , in @xcite and is intimately related to issues associated with the canonical quantization of classical systems with a position - dependent mass @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the following definition of the partition function : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is defined as : @xmath33 the partition function @xmath34 satisfies the differential equation @xmath35 with initial condition @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",

    "the solution of ( [ schrodinger1 ] ) can be expressed via the spectral expansion @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian operator @xmath38 , with associated eigenvalues @xmath44 .",
    "analogous to discussion of 2d wetting @xcite we can now obtain the interfacial properties from the knowledge of the propagator @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath45 , can be obtained as : @xmath46 while the joint probability @xmath47 of finding the interface at midpoint heights @xmath48 and @xmath49 at positions @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , is : @xmath52 further simplifications arises if we assume the existence of a bounded ground eigenstate @xmath53 .",
    "then , substitution of the spectral expansion ( [ partfunc4 ] ) into ( [ defpw0 ] ) reads ( for an infinitely long wedge ) @xmath54 similarly the excess wedge free - energy per unit length of an infinitely long wedge is identified with the ground eigenvalue @xmath55 .",
    "the two - point correlation function @xmath56 can be obtained in a similar manner : @xmath57 \\label{correlation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for large separations this vanishes exponentially allowing us to determine the correlation length @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is eigenvalue corresponding to the first excited eigenstate .",
    "this result still holds even if @xmath59 corresponds to the lower limit of the continuous part of the spectrum of @xmath38 , although now the leading order of @xmath56 is not purely exponential but is modulated by a power of @xmath60 .",
    "an interesting connection with 2d wetting problems can now be seen .",

    "however , our definition of the path integral ( [ partfunc2 ] ) and ( [ partfunc3 ] ) leads to a novel term in the wedge binding potential , which will be essential in our study and ensures thermodynamic consistency .",
    "the filling potential @xmath17 must fulfill some requirements . in order that the interface does not penetrate the substrate",
    ", @xmath17 has a hard - wall repulsion for @xmath72 .",
    "consequently we need to impose an appropriate boundary condition on the eigenfunctions of @xmath38 at @xmath73 .",
    "the analytical expression of the boundary condition is obtained by a regularization procedure : we assume that the filling potential @xmath23 and the position - dependent stiffness @xmath74 are constant for @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is some microscopic scale .",
    "furthermore , we impose that @xmath13 must be continuous at @xmath77 , so @xmath78 . on the other hand , the filling potential can take an arbitrary value @xmath79 .",
    "the latter square - well potential models the modification of the filling potential @xmath17 for small @xmath16 due to the line tension associated with the wedge bottom .",
    "the eigenstates must fulfill the usual matching conditions that @xmath80 and @xmath81 are continuous at @xmath77 .",
    "finally , we consider the appropriate scaling limit as @xmath82 .    the qualitative form of the filling potential depends on the order of the mean - field phase transition @xcite . for critical filling with long - ranged intermolecular forces ,",
    "the binding potential at bulk coexistence behaves as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a hamaker constant while the exponent @xmath85 depends on the range of the forces .",

    "this is replaced by an exponential decay @xmath87 where @xmath88 is an inverse bulk correlation length .",
    "the presence of the fluctuation - induced filling potential @xmath89 in ( [ schrodinger1 ] ) gives rise to two distinct scenarios . for @xmath90 and large @xmath16 ,",
    "the direct contribution in ( [ schrodinger1 ] ) @xmath91 is negligible compared to the fluctuation - induced potential @xmath92 arising from the position dependent stiffness . in this case",
    "we anticipate universal , fluctuation dominated behaviour . on the other hand , for @xmath93 and large @xmath16 we can neglect @xmath92 . since the @xmath94 contribution to the binding potential is now repulsive , we expect a qualitatively different phase diagram .",

    "the filled circle locates the borderline between the first - order transition line ( dashed line ) and the second - order transition line ( thick continuous line ) between the bound and unbound states .",
    "these correspond to a tricritical point and a critical end - point for short - ranged and long - ranged forces , respectively . in the latter case",

    "the borderline between the first - order and the second - order transition lines corresponds to a tricritical point ( analogous to the 2d critical wetting case ) . for long - ranged forces the analogy between 3d filling and 2d wetting still holds ( see above ) .",
    "however , as the effective binding potential is repulsive for large @xmath16 at @xmath27 , the similarity must be established with 2d _ first - order _ wetting . as for contact binding potentials ,",
    "we expect the interface to be bound to the wedge bottom at @xmath27 for a large well depth @xmath97 ( corresponding to the line - tension contribution ) . as @xmath97 decreases , the interface will unbind along the @xmath27 path .",
    "however , the interface must tunnel through a free - energy barrier to become unbound .",
    "consequently , the borderline between the first - order and second - order wedge filling is a critical end - point , where the spectator phase is the bound state at @xmath27 .",
    "actually , the connection with wetting phenomena also leads naturally to this picture , since first - order wetting was previously recognized as an interfacial critical - end point scenario @xcite . in principle , we may expect the first - order transition line to continue in the partially filled region as the coexistence between two bound states with different adsorptions .",
    "this thin - thick transition is analogue to the prewetting line , and it should terminate at a critical point . however , the quasi - one - dimensional character of the wedge geometry rules out this transition , as it is destroyed by breather - mode fluctuations",

    "we wish to understand how such long - ranged forces alter the nature of the phase diagram and in particular the change from first - order to continuous filling behaviour .",

    "the position of the minimum is governed for @xmath243 by the mean - field interfacial height : @xmath244 since for long - ranged forces we anticipate that mean - field theory describes correctly the critical filling transition , a third lengthscale is the mean - field roughness , identified as @xcite : @xmath245 since in our case @xmath246 , we find , from ( [ lwmf ] ) @xmath247 where our definition of @xmath221 is unchanged from the previous section .",
    "it is remarkable that the roughness is independent of the strength of van der waals interactions .",

    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath263 , so in the scaling limit the threshold for the existence of a bound state is the same as for the contact binding potential .",

    "consequently we recover the results obtained earlier for the special case @xmath27 .",

    "the non - existence of ground state for @xmath27 indicates that the filling transition is critical .",
    "we anticipate that mean - field theory will describe faithfully singularities at the critical wedge filling @xcite . thus we expect that the interfacial height pdf is centered around @xmath275 with gaussian fluctuations on the scale of @xmath276 representing the breather mode excitations .",

    "we expand @xmath23 around its minimum up to quadratic order , so the shift may be estimated via : @xmath281 implying that @xmath282 which vanishes as @xmath224",
    ".    we can now proceed with a more formal derivation .",
    "equation ( [ groundstatevdw3 ] ) can be written as : @xmath283 where we have defined : @xmath284 with @xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "note that ( [ groundstatevdw5 ] ) is the wavefunction of the harmonic oscillator in the @xmath287 coordinate ( in units of @xmath288 ) , modulated by the factor @xmath289 .",
    "as in the latter case , @xmath53 will increase exponentially as @xmath290 , i.e. @xmath111 and large @xmath275 , unless @xmath208 is a non - negative integer .",
    "this result is independent of the explicit value of @xmath196 .",
    "consequently , the shift @xmath291 for the lowest eigenvalues is given by : @xmath292 with @xmath293 a non - negative integer .",
    "the ground eigenstate will correspond to the case @xmath294 .",
    "the corresponding pdf becomes a gaussian : @xmath295 with @xmath296 , and roughness @xmath297 .",
    "finally , the longitudinal correlation length @xmath298 .",
    "consequently , the explicit transfer matrix solution is in complete agreement with the predicted mean - field values for the critical exponents when @xmath86 @xcite : @xmath299 , @xmath300 , @xmath301 and @xmath302 .    finally , we search for the existence of the thin - thick transition line .",
    "our calculations show that there is no sharp phase transition for @xmath190 .",
    "however , we observe that the interfacial pdf becomes bimodal for @xmath126 and some range of values of @xmath190 .",

    "in this paper we have reported analytical results for 3d wedge filling transitions in the presence of short - ranged and long - ranged ( van der waals ) interactions based on exact solution of the continuum transfer equations for a pseudo one - dimensional interfacial hamiltonian .",
    "first - order and continuous ( critical ) filling are possible for both types of force depending on the strength of the line tension associated with the decoration of the wedge bottom . our analytical solution for the interfacial height pdfs at critical filling recovers the known values of the critical exponents for critical filling for short and long - ranged forces .",
    "in addition we have elucidated the nature of the cross - over from first to critical filling which occurs at a specific value of the wedge bottom line tension .",
    "this is qualitatively different for systems with short and long ranged forces whose surface phase diagrams are shown to have tricritical and critical end - points respectively .",
    "to finish we argue that these results , which are proto - typical of the fluctuation dominated and mean - field regimes respectively , are qualitatively valid for any type of binding potential .",
    "as already mentioned , the 3d wedge filling phenomenon can be mapped onto a 2d wetting problem with a new collective coordinate @xmath308 .",
    "if we suppose that , at the filling phase boundary , @xmath309 for large @xmath16 , we can make use of a renormalization - group arguments to determine the allowed behaviour . as @xmath19 and @xmath310 are always relevant operators , we will restrict ourselves to the filling transition boundary @xmath27 , @xmath95 .",
    "the effective 2d wetting binding potential decays faster than @xmath311 , so it becomes irrelevant in the renormalization - group sense @xcite .",
    "the renormalization - group flows are dominated by the unstable fixed point and the stable fixed point for the 2d wetting binding potential @xmath312 , which correspond to the tricritical and critical filling transition , respectively .",
    "thus , for large scales the only effect of such binding potentials that decay faster than @xmath313 is to renormalize the line tension associated with the wedge bottom .    for long - ranged binding potentials i.e. those for which , at @xmath27 , @xmath314 for large @xmath16 , we may resort to a mean - field analysis @xcite .",
    "we expect that close to the filling transition the pdf is asymptotically a gaussian characterized by the mean - field interfacial height @xmath275 and roughness @xmath276 .",
    "however , if the next - to - leading order to the wedge binding potential is determined by the short - distance repulsive part of @xmath10 , we find a similar scenario to the one depicted in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "in particular , it is possible to bind the interface to the wedge bottom .",
    "the interfacial roughness will be controlled by the ( microscopic ) lengthscale @xmath315 corresponding to the maximum of the total effective binding potential .",
    "the existence of such a bound state , as well as the threshold to the critical filling transition will depend on the specific details of the interfacial binding potential .",
    "the predicted filling phenomenology presented in this paper can hopefully be checked experimentally or by computer simulations of more microscopic models .",

    "it should be straightforward to induce first - order filling by weakening the local spin - substrate interaction near the wedge bottom .",
    "in contrast our predictions for first - order filling with van der waals forces may well be amenable to experimental verification sometime in the near future .",
    "taking an even broader perspective it may be that the chemical decoration of a wedge bottom will provide a practical means of eliminating large scale interfacial fluctuations .",

    "<S> we study filling phenomena in 3d wedge geometries paying particular attention to the role played by a line tension associated with the wedge bottom . </S>",
    "<S> our study is based on transfer matrix analysis of an effective one dimensional model of 3d filling which accounts for the breather - mode excitations of the interfacial height </S>",
    "<S> . the transition may be first - order or continuous ( critical ) depending on the strength of the line tension associated with the wedge bottom . </S>",
    "<S> exact results are reported for the interfacial properties near filling with both short - ranged ( contact ) forces and also van der waals interactions . for sufficiently short - ranged forces </S>",
    "<S> we show the lines of critical and first - order filling meet at a tricritical point . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with the case of dispersion forces for which the lines meet at a critical end - point . </S>",
    "<S> our transfer matrix analysis is compared with generalized random - walk arguments based on a necklace model and is shown to be a thermodynamically consistent description of fluctuation effects at filling . </S>",
    "<S> connections with the predictions of conformal invariance for droplet shapes in wedges is also made . </S>"
