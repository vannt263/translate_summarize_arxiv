    "it is quite natural to go beyond semi - classical general relativity and to investigate the inflationary scenario for multiplicatively - renormalizable higher derivative gravity as well as for string - inspired gravities .",
    "the explicit calculation in this direction at strong gravity regime of higher - derivative qg was done in ref .",
    "@xcite where possibility of viable qg - induced inflation was proved .",
    "of course , being the multiplicatively - renormalizable theory what gives the chance to evaluate qg corrections , higher - derivative qg represents merely the effective theory .",

    "one can expect to account for qg effects at least qualitatively within such theory .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study higher - derivative qg effects for higgs - like inflation . as simplified model",
    "we take first massless scalar electrodynamics and investigate rg - improved inflation in such theory . at the next stage , we consider higher - derivative qg coupled to scalar electrodynamics and evaluate the corresponding rg - improved effective potential .",
    "the ocurrence of viable inflation which is realized thanks to such rg - improved effective potential with account of qg effects is proved .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section * ii * we consider the multiplicatively - renormalizable massless scalar electrodynamics in curved space - time .",
    "the form of the renormalization - group improved scalar effective potential is derived in this theory , paying special attention to the non - minimal scalar - gravitational sector . in section * iii * we analyze inflation in frames of above scalar quantum electrodynamics in jordan frame .",
    "we explicitly derive the slow - roll parameters , the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio showing how the quantum corrections enter in these expressions .",
    "we compute the @xmath0-folds number and we demonstrate that the model leads to a viable inflationary scenario according with the last planck and bicep2/keck array data . in section * iv * we consider multiplicatively - renormalizable higher - derivative gravity coupled with scalar electrodynamics .",
    "the complicated expression for rg improved effective potential in such theory ( with account of qg corrections ) is obtained .",
    "section * v * is devoted to the study of qg - induced inflation in comparison with the simplified case of scalar electrodynamics analyzed before .",

    "also in this case , we carefully investigated how the qg corrections enter in the expressions for the slow - roll parameters , the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "it is found that the bound of the hubble parameter describing the quasi - de sitter solution of inflation is influenced by the correction of the mass scale of the theory . as a consequence , in order to obtain a realistic scenario , the early - time acceleration results to be weaker when the mass decreases .",

    "graceful exit occurs when @xmath225 and @xmath219 exceedes the unit .",
    "thus , the quantum gravity effects will disappear ( @xmath226 ) and our gravitational lagrangian will turn out to be general relativity plus a quadratic correction of the ricci scalar .",
    "the behaviour of this model at the end of inflation has been well investigated in literature , and it has been demonstrated that it is compatible with the reheating process for particle production at the beginning of the fridmann expansion predicted by general relativity .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed inflation for a quantum scalar electrodynamics model in curved space - time and for higher - derivative quantum gravity with scalar electrodynamics .",
    "the rg improved effective potential is calculated for both theories ( i.e. without and with qg corrections ) in jordan frame . at the frw universe , the gravitational action contains @xmath100-term beyond the hilber - einstein term @xmath5 .",
    "our analysis has been carried out in the jordan frame , due to non - equivalence of quantum corrected jordan and einstein frames .",
    "the resulting inflationary scenarios are in agreement with the planck and the last bicep2/keck array data and bring to an amount of inflation compatible with the thermalization of the observable universe .",
    "note that as it is clearly seen from the explicit expressions for slow - roll parameters the analysis of jordan frame inflation seems to be much more complicated than the corresponding analysis in convinient einstein frame .",
    "when the quadratic @xmath100-term is not asymptotically dominant in the gravitational action , its contribution appears only via log - corrections in the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio , namely it does not play a significant role in the exit from inflation , like in the jordan - frame representation of the starobinsky - like models .",
    "however , we note that , due to the running mass scale of the theory , the @xmath100-term may be dominant for a large subplanckian value of the curvature : in this case we obtain a pure @xmath100-gravitational model with @xmath191-corrections .",
    "our analysis shows how one - loop qed and qg corrections enter in the spectral index and in the tensor - to - scalar ratio of the model under discussion .",
    "the most interesting corrections in the coupling constants of the gravitational action from qg effects are related to the running gravitational constant . here",
    ", we stress that the viability of the inflationary scenario does not directly require that the qg correction to @xmath5 is small , like in the case of the @xmath191-quantum correction to @xmath100 or the one - loop corrections in the effective potential of the field .",
    "if at the early - time epoch the planck mass of the theory decreases , the bound of the field must be smaller to get a realistic inflationary scenario . as a consequence ,",
    "also the hubble parameter of the ( quasi ) de sitter solution describing inflation is smaller leading to a weaker acceleration .",
    "it is interesting to note that it is straitforward to generalize this study for standard model with higher - derivative qg .",
