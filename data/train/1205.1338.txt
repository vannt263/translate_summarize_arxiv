    "the phase diagram and critical properties of spin systems with quenched disorder attracted considerable interest for decades .",
    "one usually distinguishes two types of quenched disorder : ( i ) random - temperature like disorder corresponding to randomness coupled to the local energy density as , for example , in diluted ferromagnets @xcite ; ( ii ) random field like disorder corresponding to the case when the order parameter couples to a random symmetry breaking field  @xcite .",
    "the influence of random - temperature disorder is rather well understood . there",
    "exist several powerful methods to study the phase behavior and criticality such as perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "the effect of the random field disorder being more profound is much less studied .",
    "the prominent example is the critical behavior of the random field ising model ( rfim ) which complete understanding is still lacking despite significant numerical , analytical and experimental efforts @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the perturbative calculations including standard rg methods lead to incorrect results , in particular , to the so - called dimensional reduction ( dr ) .",
    "analysis of the feynman diagrams giving the leading singularities @xcite or using supersymmetry @xcite predicts that the critical behavior of the rfim in @xmath0 dimension is the same as that of the pure system in @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "consequently , the lower critical dimension of the rfim below which there is no true long - range order is expected to be @xmath10 .",
    "however , the simple imry - ma arguments show that the lower critical dimension of the rfim is in fact @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the deviation from the dr prediction is also confirmed by the high - temperature expansion @xcite and real space rg  @xcite .",
    "the failure of dr can be explained by complicated energy landscape which renders the perturbation theory spoiled to all orders by unphysical averaging over multiple minima and maxima .",
    "the latter can be formulated in terms of supersymmetry or replica symmetry breaking @xcite . to overcome this obstacle one needs a non - perturbative method or correct resumming the perturbation theory .",
    "the considerable progress has been achieved last years in studying the @xmath1 models in which disorder couples to the @xmath12-component order parameter either linearly as in the random field ( rf ) case or bilinearly as in a random anisotropy ( ra ) system .",
    "these models are relevant for diverse physical systems including amorphous magnets  @xcite , diluted antiferromagnets in a uniform external magnetic field  @xcite , liquid crystals in porous media  @xcite , nematic elastomers  , critical fluids in aerogels  @xcite , vortices in type ii superconductors  @xcite , and stochastic inflation in cosmology @xcite .",
    "similar to the rfim these models suffer of dr  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the expansion around the lower critical dimension of the the rf @xmath1 model @xmath2 generates an infinite number of relevant operators which can be parameterized by a single function  @xcite .",
    "however , the rg flow of this function has no analytic fixed point ( fp ) .",
    "only almost two decades later , being inspired by the progress in disordered elastic systems  @xcite , it was realized that the scaling properties of the rf and ra systems are encoded in a nonanalytic fp  @xcite .",
    "the non - analytic fps control the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transitions in the rf and ra @xmath1 model and allow one to compute the critical exponents within @xmath13 expansion  @xcite .",
    "the obtained exponents are different from the dr prediction .",
    "the frg calculations have been extended to two - loop order @xcite and the effect of long - range disorder correlations has been studied  @xcite . using developed in ref .",
    "@xcite truncated exact frg it was argued that spontaneous breaking of the supersymmetry which leads to a breakdown of dr , occurs only below a critical dimension",
    "@xmath14  @xcite .",
    "a more peculiar issue concerns the phase diagram of the rf and ra models below @xmath15 .",
    "it is known that for the rf model and models with isotropic distributions of random anisotropies true long - range order is forbidden below @xmath2 ( for anisotropic distributions , long - range order can occur even below @xmath15  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , quasi - long - range order ( qlro ) with zero order parameter and an infinite correlation length can persist even for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the lower critical dimension for the paramagnetic - qlro transition . for example , the gaussian variational approximation predicts that the vortex lattice in disordered type - ii superconductors can form the so - called bragg glass exhibiting slow logarithmic growth of displacements  @xcite .",
    "this system can be mapped onto the three dimensional rf @xmath18 model , in which the bragg glass corresponds to the qlro phase .",
    "indeed , for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the frg equations have attractive fps which describe the qlro phases of rf and ra models  @xcite . despite that the question of the lower critical dimension of the paramagnetic - qlro transition",
    "is still controversial . in order to study the transition between the qlro phase and the disordered phase using frg",
    ", one has to go beyond the one - loop approximation .",
    "the truncated exact frg @xcite and the two - loop frg @xcite performed using a double expansion in @xmath19 and @xmath20 provide an additional singly unstable fp which controls the transition .",
    "both methods give qualitatively similar pictures of the frg flows : the critical and attractive fps merge in some dimension @xmath21 which is considered as the lower critical dimension of the paramagnetic - qlro transition .",
    "for the rf @xmath18 model , both methods give approximately the same estimation @xmath22 , and thus , suggest that there is no bragg glass phase in @xmath23 .",
    "however , one has to take caution when extrapolating results obtained for small @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the model of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite which belongs to the so - called `` hard - spin '' models , the system studied in ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to `` soft spins '' .",
    "they can belong to different universality classes since the soft spin model allows for topological defects which destroy the qlro .",
    "the real systems , usually , are finite and have boundaries which effect is twofold : ( i ) the free energy of the system in addition to the bulk contribution proportional to the volume acquires a new term proportional to the area of the surface ; ( ii ) the presence of boundaries breaks the translational invariance . in general , this can modify the behavior in the boundary region extended in the bulk only over distances of the order of the bulk correlation length .",
    "however , at the bulk critical point or in the qlro phase , the bulk correlation length is infinite so that one can expect that the effect of boundaries to be more pronounced .",
    "indeed , the presence of the boundaries introduces a whole set of critical exponents describing the scaling behavior at and close to the boundary at criticality @xcite .",
    "several different classes of the surface transitions are known depending upon boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the _ ordinary transition _ corresponds to the case when the surface magnetization is suppressed due to reduced number of close neighbors near the boundary so that the surface ordering is completely driven by the bulk magnetization .",
    "if for some reason the coupling between spins on the surface is sufficiently enhanced with respect to the bulk coupling or there is an external surface magnetic field , the surface may order before the bulk does . the latter",
    "is called the _ surface transition_. then the system can undergo the so - called _ extraordinary transition _ in the presence of ordered surface .",
    "the two lines of the extraordinary transition and the surface transition meet at the multicritical point which is called the _",
    "special transition_. the last three transition can take place only if the dimension of the surface @xmath24 is above the lower critical dimension for the transition .",
    "these transitions have been studied for various systems with discrete and continuous symmetries using different methods , such as rg and numerical simulations ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of weak random temperature like disorder on the surface criticality was studied using rg methods in refs .",
    "however , not so much is known about the surface criticality in systems with rf disorder . the phase diagram of the 3d semi -",
    "infinite rfim as a function of the ratio of bulk and surface interactions and the ratio of bulk and surface fields has been studied using a mean field approximation in ref .",
    "the surface criticality of the rfim has been studied numerically in ref .",
    "it was also shown that the rf disorder on the surface of a 3d spin system with continuous symmetry destroys the long - range order in the bulk , and , instead , a qlro emerges  @xcite . in this work",
    "we address the question how do the rf and ra disorder in the bulk effect the behavior of spin systems with continuous symmetry in vicinity of free surfaces .",
    "in particular , we consider the ordinary surface transition of the rf and ra @xmath1 models for @xmath25 and the spin correlations in the qlro phase near a free surface for @xmath26 .    the paper is organized as follows .",
