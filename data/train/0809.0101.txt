    "a rather wide class of physical problems can be framed as the analysis of the sensitivity of the statistical properties of a system to external parameters , and , actually , such sensitivities often define physical quantities of great conceptual relevance , as in outstanding case of maxwell s relations in classical thermodynamics . in this context , the response theory formalizes the thought experimental apparatus comprising of the system under investigation , of a measuring devic , of a clock , and of a set of turnable knobs controlling , possibly with continuity , the value of the external parameters .    in the case of physical systems",
    "near to an equilibrium represented by the canonical measure , kubo @xcite introduced a response theory able to describe up to any order of nonlinearity the impact of weak perturbations to the hamiltonian on the statistical properties of a general observable .",
    "apart from its profound theoretical value , the kubo approach has allowed for the definition of applicable tools for obtaining a systematic and detailed analysis of the forced fluctuations due to weak external forcings , thus proving to be a suitable tool for a comprehensive treatment of optical , acoustical , mechanical phenomena @xcite .    the response theory recently developed by ruelle @xcite for the description of the impact of small , periodic perturbations on the statistical properties of a measurable observable of an axiom a dynamical system -",
    "whose attractor defines an srb measure @xcite - allows for a generalization of the whole apparatus of the kubo theory to the case of non - equilibrium steady state statistical mechanical systems .",
    "the kubo and ruelle response theories are formally rather similar , as in both cases the impact of perturbation can be expressed as the expectation value of a specific operator over the statistical ensemble of the unperturbed state , the main ( crucial ) diversity being , instead , in the properties of the probability measure of integration .",
    "in quasi - equilibrium statistical mechanics , it has been recognized that , thanks to the general principle of causality of the response , the linear and nonlinear generalized susceptibilities of the system , describing its response in the frequency domain , feature specific properties of analyticity , allowing for the definition of kramers - kronig ( k - k ) relations , connecting their real and imaginary parts , and for the derivation of sum rules , which connect the response of the system at all frequencies to the expectation value of specific observables at the unperturbed state @xcite .",
    "these integral relations play a crucial role in several research and technological areas , and most prominently in condensed matter physics and material science @xcite .",
    "ruelle @xcite proved that , whereas the fluctuation - dissipation relation , cornerstone of quasi - equilibrium statistical mechanics , can not be straightforwardly extended to the non - equilibrium case , thus clarifying an earlier intuition by lorenz on the non equivalence between forced and free fluctuations in the climate system @xcite , in the case of perturbed axiom a system it is possible to define a linear susceptibility which is analytic in the upper complex plane of the frequency variable , and derive rigorously k - k relations .",
    "more recently , building upon these results and following @xcite , in @xcite it was shown that a large and well defined class of nonlinear susceptibilities , including those responsible for harmonic generation processes at all orders , obey generalized k - k relations and , additionally , sum rules can be established .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that a much larger set of dynamical systems than the axiom a ones obeys these properties , as recently suggested by theoretical arguments @xcite and by some rather convincing numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "note that , nevertheless , results on axiom a systems are already quite powerful in terms of practical applications , if one accepts the chaotic hypothesis by gallavotti and cohen @xcite , stating that large systems behave as though they were axiom a systems when macroscopic statistical properties are considered ,    in this paper we present the first evidence of applicability of dispersion relations and sum rules for a nonlinear susceptibility of a chaotic dynamical system .",
    "we consider a monochromatic ( weak ) < external perturbation to the flow of the lorenz 63 system @xcite .",
    "first , we perform the analysis of the linear response , thus providing an extension of the results presented by reick @xcite .",
    "then , we analyze the susceptibility describing the second harmonic response , providing a detailed discussion of k - k relations and of the sum rules , where the outputs of the simulations and the theoretical predictions are compared .",
    "moreover , we define general , self - consistent algebraic relations connecting the harmonic generation susceptibilities of different observables and specialize them for the lorenz 63 perturbed system treated here . as",
    "the lorenz 63 system is far from being an axiom a system , our results suggest that what shown in @xcite has a much wider applicability than what delimited by the hypotheses of the theoretical derivation .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recapitulate the general theoretical background behind our analysis . in section 3",
    "we describe our simulations , discuss our experimental procedure , present the mathematical tools for data analysis , and obtain from the general theory specific results for the considered system .",
    "in section 4 we describe our main findings . in section 5",
    "we summarize our results and present our conclusions . in appendix [ kerr ]",
    "we present the formula for the first correction to the linear response . in appendix [ observables ]",
    "we show a procedure for defining self - consistent relation connecting the harmonic generation susceptibilities of various observables .",
    "we consider the dynamical system @xmath0 .",
    "we then perturb the flow by adding a time - modulated component to the vector field , so that the resulting dynamics is described by @xmath1 .",
    "following ruelle @xcite , in the case of a perturbation to an axiom a dynamical system , it possible to express the expectation value of a measurable observable @xmath2 in terms of a perturbation series : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the invariant measure of the unperturbed system .",
    "the @xmath5 term can be expressed as a _",
    "n_-uple convolution integral of the @xmath5 order green function with _",
    "n _ terms , each representing the suitably delayed time modulation of the perturbative vector field : @xmath6 the @xmath5 order green function @xmath7 is causal , _",
    "i.e. _ its value is zero if any of the argument is non positive , and can be expressed as time dependent expectation value of an observable evaluated over the measure of the statistical mechanical system : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the heaviside function , @xmath10 describes the impacts of the perturbative vector field , and @xmath11 is the time evolution operator due to unperturbed vector field so , that @xmath12 for any observable @xmath13 . as discussed in @xcite , in the case of quasi equilibrium hamiltonian system @xmath14 corresponds to the usual ( absolutely continuous ) canonical distribution , and the green function given above is the same as that obtained in standard kubo theory @xcite .",
    "instead , in the more general case analyzed by ruelle , @xmath4 is the singular srb measure .",
    "if we compute the fourier transform of @xmath15 we obtain : @xmath16 where the dirac @xmath17 guarantees that the sum of the arguments of the fourier transforms of the time modulation functions equals the argument of the fourier transform of @xmath15 , and the susceptibility function is defined as : @xmath18.\\ ] ] whereas the green functions describe coupling processes in the time - domain , this function describes the impact of perturbations in the frequency - domain having frequency @xmath19 .    as discussed in @xcite , the linear susceptibility @xmath20 in an analitic function in the upper complex @xmath21 plane , as a result of the causality of the linear green function , so that it obeys kramers - kronig relations @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , in @xcite it was shown that @xmath22 , responsible for @xmath5 order harmonic generation processes , features the same analytic properties as the linear susceptibility .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath22 is determined by the short - term response of the system , and it can be proved that in general @xmath23 with @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and integer , it is possible also to prove that , if @xmath26 is even , @xmath27 is real , whereas , if @xmath26 is odd , @xmath28 is imaginary .",
    "the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 depend on the specific system under investigation , on the considered observable , and on the order @xmath31 of nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "therefore , since all moments of the susceptibility have the same analytic properties , a large set of pairs of independent dispersion relations is obtained : @xmath32 @xmath33 with @xmath34 , in order to ensure the convergence of the integrals , with @xmath35 indicating integration in principal part . comparing the asymptotic behavior with that obtained by applying the superconvergence theorem @xcite to the general k - k relations ( [ harmo3])-([harmo4 ] ) , we derive the following set of vanishing sum rules : @xmath36 @xmath37 if @xmath38 we obtain the following non - vanishing sum rule : @xmath39 whereas , if @xmath40 , the non - vanishing sum rule reads as follows : @xmath41",
    "following reick @xcite , we perturb the @xmath42 equation of the classical lorenz 63 system with a weak periodic forcing : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath21 is the frequency of the forcing , and @xmath47 is the parameter controlling its strength .",
    "note that reick used @xmath47 instead of @xmath48 ; our choice will be motivated later . with these parameters values ,",
    "the ( unperturbed , @xmath49 ) classical lorenz 63 system is chaotic and nonhyperbolic , as changes in the value of @xmath50 cause sequences of bifurcations , which alter the topology of the attractor .",
    "nevertheless , we stick to the definition provided in eq .",

    "we choose an initial condition belonging to attractor of the unperturbed system and , without loss of generality , we set @xmath55 . since the system is chaotic , the fourier transform of @xmath56 has a continuous background spectrum , so that , detecting and disentangling the response of the system to the @xmath21-periodic perturbation , which results into peaks positioned at the harmonic frequencies @xmath57 , @xmath58 , is harder than in the quasi - equilibrium case .",

    "note that , consistently with our definitions , there is a factor 2 of difference with respect to the ( equivalent ) expression given in @xcite . the susceptibility @xmath62 , when limits are considered , does not depend on @xmath52 . whereas the @xmath63 limit corresponds to the physical condition of considering an infinitesimal perturbation , in the @xmath64",
    "limit the noise - to - signal ratio goes to zero . of course , in reality for every simulation we can measure @xmath65 , so that , as discussed in @xcite , @xmath66 must be long enough for detecting any signal for finite time series .",
    "the larger the parameter @xmath47 , the better is the signal - to - noise ratio , but , at the same time , the worse the validity of the linear approximation ( and , in general , of the perturbative approach ) .    as we wish to keep @xmath47 as small as possible in actual simulations , and avoid using very long integrations , which may problematic in terms of the computer memory , in order to improve the signal detection we introduce an additional procedure based upon ergodic averaging . for each frequency component of the background continuous spectrum , which is related to the chaotic nature of the unperturbed dynamics ,",
    "the phase of the signal depends ( delicately ) on the initial condition @xmath52 .",
    "since , instead , the phase of the response of the system to the external poerturbation is ( asymptotically ) well - defined ( see eq .",
    "[ chi1a ] ) , by averaging the susceptibility over an ensemble of initial conditions randomly chosen on the attractor of the unperturbed system we can improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we then define : @xmath67 where @xmath68 are random initial conditions belonging to the attractor of the unperturbed system , such that : @xmath69 therefore , we choose @xmath70 as our best estimator of the true susceptibility @xmath62 in all of our calculations .",
    "we now propose some procedures for analyzing the nonlinear response of the system . probably , the two most relevant nonlinear phenomena usually observed in weakly perturbed nonlinear systems are the correction to the linear response and the harmonic generation process .",
    "the correction to the linear response , which is basically described by the third order kerr susceptibility , can not be treated with the k - k formalism , as discussed in @xcite , so that it will not be discussed further .",
    "anyway , an operational definition of such a susceptibility is provided in app .",

    "we then focus on the lowest order nonlinear susceptibility responsible for @xmath5 order harmonic generation is @xmath71 @xcite , which , as previously described , obeys an entire class of k - k relations .",
