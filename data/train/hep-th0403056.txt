    "the history of modifications of einstein s theory of gravity is a long and winding one , and its beginnings almost date back to the publication of general relativity itself @xcite .",
    "a main motivation for all proposed modifications of general relativity comes from the fact that the spacetime solutions of this theory , even in simple cases , may contain curvature singularities .",
    "the existence of such solutions creates problems , both mathematical and physical ; a famous example is the black hole information paradoxon which seems to make it impossible to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics @xcite . the solution of these problems is usually postponed to an unforeseeable future with the claim that a quantum theory of gravity would smooth out the singularities .",
    "it is indeed sensible to expect a radically altered short distance behaviour in quantum gravity and string theory , and this becomes apparent , respectively , in the quantisation of the area or volume operators in loop quantum gravity , or in the appearance of higher order curvature corrections to the einstein - hilbert action in string theory , see e.g. @xcite . but",
    "postponing the solution of existing classical problems to a future quantum theory means accepting to quantise the already ` problematical ' classical theory .",
    "it might well be the case that this causes unnecessary additional difficulties .",
    "for this reason alone , it is worthwhile to change the perspective and to reverse the procedure : try to improve on classical general relativity _ before _ quantising it .",
    "modified theories of gravity should conform to a number of criteria , of which the most important ones are that they should reduce to general relativity in a limit that covers the range of observations and they should not contain ghost poles . in the construction of such theories , one can essentially embark on two different routes .",
    "the first is to change the stage , i.e. , to enrich or alter the geometrical structure of the spacetime manifold ; examples falling into this category are theories with non - vanishing torsion , like einstein - cartan theory , e.g. @xcite , or those based on a non - symmetric metric , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the second possibility is to provide a new screenplay , i.e. , to change the dynamics of the gravitational field .",
    "this happens , for example , in string theory which provides higher order corrections to the einstein - hilbert action while retaining the lorentzian structure of the spacetime manifold .",
    "the standard way of proceeding , in either case , is to formulate a consistent new action principle and to hope that the solutions of the corresponding equations of motion have nicer properties than the solutions to einstein s theory .",
    "such constructions , however , can be at best educated guesses , because underlying geometrical concepts , which are of utmost importance in any theory of gravity , are very hard , or even impossible , to identify . in this article ,",
    "the programme is a different one .",
    "our starting point is the physical notion of accelerations between nearby geodesics , and we will investigate the possibility to place bounds on these accelerations .",
    "the kinematical structure of these bounds will be analysed and the results will be used for the construction of novel gravity theories . in consequence , all solutions of these theories will obey the acceleration bounds .",
    "it is clear that this might not be enough to get rid of all curvature singularities , but , in any case , this is an important first step of improvement on classical general relativity .    throughout this article",
    ", we use the geometrical setting of a @xmath0-dimensional torsion - free manifold @xmath1 with a symmetric metric @xmath2 and the compatible metric connection @xmath3 which satisfies @xmath4 . consider a congruence @xmath5 of affinely parameterised geodesics such that @xmath6 and a connecting vector field @xmath7 with @xmath8=0 $ ] .",
    "then the acceleration , in the direction @xmath7 , between nearby geodesics of the congruence @xmath5 is measured by the geodesic deviation equation , or jacobi equation , @xmath9 where @xmath10}z $ ] defines the riemann tensor for all vector fields @xmath11 .",
    "the projection of the above acceleration onto the connecting vector @xmath7 is given by the riemann - christoffel tensor , which carries all its indices downstairs , since @xmath12 in order to place a bound on this physically meaningful quantity , we have to normalise the expression .",
    "there are essentially two ways of doing so .",
    "the first is simply to divide out the squared lengths of the vectors @xmath5 and @xmath7 , i.e. , to normalise by @xmath13 .",
    "another possibility is to divide by the square of the area of the parallelogram spanned by @xmath5 and @xmath7 , i.e. , by @xmath14 .",
    "it is the latter possibility that we will choose because it relates the projection of the geodesic deviation acceleration to the concept of sectional curvatures of the manifold .",
    "we will consider the kinematics of bounded sectional curvatures , in riemannian and lorentzian geometries in turn , in sections [ sec .",
    "riemannian ] and [ sec .",
    "lorentzian ] . in section [ sec .",
    "dynamics ] , we will devise gravitational dynamics that automatically enforce these bounds for all solutions of the gravitational field equations . the crucial requirement that the theory should be free of ghosts narrows down the admissible gravitational actions to those with a dirac - born - infeld invariance group , as will be explained in section [ sec , dbi ] .",
    "highly interesting applications of the new framework , especially to the case of static , spherically symmetric spacetimes , will be derived in section [ sec .",
    "applications ] . there",
    ", we will find that the kinematics of bounded sectional curvatures imply drastic changes in the spacetime structure in comparison to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "in particular , spacelike singularities will be excluded .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section [ sec .",
    "discussion ] .",
    "consider a @xmath0-dimensional riemannian spacetime @xmath1 with a symmetric positive definite metric @xmath2 .",
    "the sectional curvature @xmath15 at a point @xmath16 with respect to a plane spanned by two vectors @xmath17 is the total curvature of the two - surface of geodesics through @xmath18 and tangent to that plane .",
    "it is induced from the riemann - christoffel tensor by @xmath19 where the tensor @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 note that @xmath22 is the squared area of the parallelogram formed by @xmath5 and @xmath7 , so that the sectional curvature @xmath15 determines exactly the normalised value of the projection of the geodesic deviation acceleration on the connecting vector , as it has been discussed in the introduction .",
    "the tensor @xmath23 has the same symmetry properties as the riemann - christoffel tensor and the squared parallelogram area @xmath22 is always positive as long as @xmath5 and @xmath7 are linearly independent . for later use , we define the set @xmath24    the sectional curvature is a function on the grassmannian of two - planes at the point @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "this follows from the fact that , under a non - singular change of basis from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , according to    @xmath28    which is a @xmath29-transformation with non - vanishing determinant @xmath30 , both @xmath31 and @xmath22 are multiplied by the same positive factor @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the value of the ratio @xmath33 stays unchanged .",
    "the grassmannian @xmath34 can be understood as the set of pairs of linearly independent vectors @xmath35 with its elements identified under the equivalence relation of a @xmath29 basis change , @xmath36 .",
    "note that the grassmannian is not a vector space , but a variety .",
    "we will explain in section [ sec .",
    "lorentzian ] why this is a point of crucial importance when studying lorentzian manifolds .",
    "a further important fact is that all sectional curvatures at a point @xmath18 determine the riemann tensor there uniquely @xcite .",
    "now we establish a bound on the absolute value of all sectional curvatures and require @xmath37 for all linearly independent @xmath38 and for all @xmath16 ( dropping the subscript @xmath18 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath39 has the dimension length squared .",
    "therefore , any theory of gravity realising such a bound would involve a fundamental , very short length scale at which considerable differences to known gravity solutions could be expected .",
    "the requirement of bounded sectional curvature can be rewritten in the form @xmath40}_{\\quad \\ , \\ , \\ , \\ , \\ , [ cd]}x_{[a}y_{b]}x^{[c}y^{d]}\\geq 0\\ , .\\ ] ] this condition has to be satisfied for both signs , which arise from the removal of the absolute value , and the @xmath41 are defined by @xmath42}_{\\quad \\ , \\ , \\ , \\ , \\ , [ cd]}=\\delta ^{[ab]}_{\\quad [ cd]}\\pm r^{[ab]}_{\\quad [ cd]}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath43 arises from @xmath23 by raising two indices .",
    "the @xmath41 are linear maps @xmath44 . due to the symmetries of @xmath23 and @xmath45 , they map any two - tensor into an antisymmetric two - tensor . for the discussion of the condition on the sectional curvatures , however , we can restrict @xmath41 to endomorphisms of antisymmetric two - tensors and consider @xmath46 .",
    "the endomorphism @xmath43 simply becomes the identity on @xmath47 .",
    "we need another definition .",
    "an element @xmath48 is called _ simple _ , if it can be decomposed as @xmath49 for @xmath17 .",
    "we write @xmath50 any element of @xmath47 can be written as a sum of simple elements because the basis elements of this space can be chosen to be simple .",
    "this allows us to consider the tensor @xmath23 , defined in ( [ eq .",
    "ddef ] ) , as a map @xmath51 by using the identification @xmath52 .",
    "the endomorphisms @xmath41 are symmetric with respect to @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath53 for all @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath41 are diagonalisable with real eigenvalues by an orthogonal transformation @xmath55 which satisfies @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that there exists an orthonormal basis @xmath57 in @xmath47 of common eigenvectors of @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( or , more precisely , of @xmath45 ) with @xmath60 . in terms of this basis",
    ", we may write any plane as a linear combination , @xmath61 . from ( [ eq",
    ". hbound ] ) , the bound on the sectional curvatures then is seen to be equivalent to @xmath62 for all @xmath38 and all points of the spacetime manifold . this is satisfied if , and only if , the eigenvalues @xmath63 are non - negative , @xmath64 . note that this is a fully covariant requirement because the characteristic polynomials of @xmath41 , and hence their eigenvalue equations @xmath65 are diffeomorphism - invariant .",
    "hence , the following holds :    _ an upper bound ( [ eq . bound ] ) on the absolute value of all sectional curvatures of a riemannian manifold is equivalent to the requirements that _",
    "00.00.0000    _ the endomorphisms @xmath46 defined in ( [ eq .",
    "endor ] ) should be diagonalisable by an element @xmath66 of the local orthogonal group @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , such that @xmath69 , and _    _",
    "@xmath41 should have non - negative eigenvalues _ @xmath64__. _ _    the first requirement is , of course , redundant in the riemannian setting .",
    "but the formulation used above lends itself much better to a generalisation to the lorentzian case than the simpler statement that @xmath41 should be positive semi - definite .      in the lorentzian case ,",
    "the spacetime metric is indefinite with signature @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , the squared area @xmath22 in the definition of sectional curvature in ( [ eq .",
    "defsec ] ) may have either sign or even vanish . accordingly , a plane spanned by the basis vectors @xmath17 is called timelike when @xmath71 , spacelike for @xmath72 and null for @xmath73 .",
    "although the sectional curvature thus is only defined on non - null planes , the knowledge of it on all these planes still determines the riemann tensor uniquely .    bounding the sectional curvatures on all non - null planes by condition ( [ eq .",
    "bound ] ) is equivalent to requiring that    [ eq .",
    "@xmath74    for all @xmath38 and for all @xmath16 .",
    "again these conditions have to be satisfied for both signs .",
    "now comes an important point !",
    "while in the riemannian case a large class of manifolds possesses bounded sectional curvatures , it turns out that imposing such bounds in the lorentzian case is extremely restrictive : on null planes , the riemann curvature has to vanish , @xmath75 .",
    "otherwise the sectional curvature could not be bounded for nearby planes @xcite .",
    "but then it follows that the sectional curvature at any given point of the manifold has the same value for every non - null plane @xcite ; hence , the whole manifold is one of constant curvature @xcite . clearly , this is not desirable for a theory of gravity as it could never cover a large enough range of solutions !",
    "these arguments show that a theory of gravity on a lorentzian spacetime manifold can not have bounds on _ all _ sectional curvatures .",
    "but the same conclusion , that the manifold has constant curvature , already follows from certain weaker assumptions , namely from bounds on either all timelike or all spacelike planes , or from either an upper or a lower bound on all non - null planes @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to avoid these rigidity theorems , a less restrictive condition has to be devised .",
    "such a condition amounts to a selection of planes for which the sectional curvatures should be bounded .",
    "observe that the above restriction of the sectional curvature map @xmath76 to all non - null ( timelike , spacelike ) planes in the grassmannian _ variety _ @xmath34 is not a natural one from the point of view of algebraic geometry , as these sets are subsets but not _ subvarieties _ of @xmath34 .",
    "a homomorphism between varieties , however , can only be sensibly restricted to subvarieties . in the following",
    ", we will therefore identify the maximal subvariety contained in the set of timelike ( spacelike ) planes and only constrain the sectional curvature for these planes .",
    "more precisely , consider the vector space @xmath47 which has already played an important r ole in the riemannian construction .",
    "not all elements @xmath77 of that space describe planes , but only the simple ones , @xmath78 .",
    "each plane corresponds to a pair of linearly independent basis vectors , i.e. , to an element of @xmath35 .",
    "but @xmath79 is isomorphic to @xmath80 via @xmath81 .",
    "so @xmath82 additionally contains a degenerate plane for which @xmath5 becomes parallel to @xmath7 .",
    "the set of planes @xmath82 forms a variety embedded in the vector space @xmath47 , for its elements satisfy the polynomial equation @xmath83 , compare e.g. @xcite .",
    "( if the length of the basis vectors is projected out , one gets the pl ucker embedding @xmath84 . ) a mathematically well - motivated subset of planes , on which one might hope to achieve bounded sectional curvatures in lorentzian manifolds , therefore , should be a subvariety of the set of all planes @xmath82 and not , for instance , the subset of all timelike planes which is not a subvariety since @xmath71 is not a polynomial equation .",
    "we return to the conditions ( [ eq . condz ] ) for bounded sectional curvature on all non - null planes .",
    "the set of timelike planes for which the conditions hold can be written as the intersection @xmath85 and in an analogous form with reversed relations for the spacelike planes .",
    "this set is not a subvariety of @xmath82 , as it is not defined by additional polynomial equations .",
    "but into it , we can embed a ` maximal subvariety ' by constructing the vector space of maximal dimension which can be embedded into the set in curly brackets .",
    "the intersection of such a linear subspace with @xmath82 is then the desired subvariety .",
    "we show now that this vector space can be found , in the present lorentzian case , by requiring the conditions _",
    "( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ on the endomorphisms @xmath41 which we have established in the riemannian case .    by _ ( i ) _ , the endomorphisms @xmath41 should be diagonalisable by the local orthogonal group which is now @xmath86 .",
    "this requirement is non - trivial in the lorentzian case : the @xmath41 are still symmetric , but now with respect to an indefinite metric , which does not guarantee diagonalisability .",
    "requiring diagonalisability , now , implies the existence of an orthonormal basis @xmath87 of @xmath47 with @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 which consists of common eigenvectors of @xmath41 with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath91 . and by _ ( ii ) _ , these eigenvalues @xmath92 and @xmath93 should be non - negative .",
    "both these requirements together imply that the linear span of timelike eigenvectors @xmath94 is the sought - for highest - dimensional linear subspace of @xmath47 which can be embedded into the set in curly brackets appearing in equation ( [ eq .",
    "intsec ] ) .",
    "this is most easily seen from the decomposition @xmath95 , which gives @xmath96 for elements",
    "@xmath77 of the linear span ( [ eq . span ] ) of the time - like eigenvectors , the above expression is clearly negative .",
    "another basis vector that could be added to enlarge the dimension of this vector space would necessarily be spacelike , so that the augmented space could not be properly embedded anymore .",
    "an analogous argument where the spacelike eigenvectors @xmath97 replace the timelike eigenvectors @xmath98 holds for the case of the spacelike planes .",
    "thus we have shown the following .    _ on a lorentzian manifold , the requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) on the endomorphisms @xmath41 , as formulated at the end of the preceding subsection , imply bounds on the sectional curvatures of certain subvarieties of the variety @xmath99 of all planes in @xmath100 . in terms of the common eigenvector basis @xmath101 of @xmath41 , these subvarieties are given by the timelike planes in @xmath102 and by the spacelike planes in @xmath103 .",
    "_    note that this mechanism of choosing the planes of bounded sectional curvature is a dynamical one , as it is the riemann tensor ( of particular spacetime solutions ) that determines the eigenvectors of the endomorphisms @xmath41 .",
    "this construction , bounding the sectional curvatures on certain subvarieties of the variety of all planes hence allows to circumvent the rigidity theorems obtained by nomizu and others .",
    "we have now established algebraic conditions that allow placing sensible bounds on the sectional curvatures along certain planes . but how does one implement that solutions of gravitational equations , yet to be devised , automatically give rise to non - negative eigenvalues for the endomorphisms @xmath41 ? a fairly general answer to this question is to use , in the equations of motion , absolutely converging power series in the riemann tensor that converge on a domain with non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "for definiteness , consider the square roots @xmath104 where we use the petrov notation for indices of @xmath47 . the index @xmath105 $ ] may take @xmath106 values and corresponds to a pair of antisymmetrised indices of @xmath107 . if the above expressions appear in the equations of motion , then any diagonalisable solution will force the eigenvalues of @xmath41 to be real and non - negative",
    ". otherwise the solution will become complex .",
    "it is very convenient , for a number of reasons , to derive the gravitational dynamics from an action principle .",
    "not only does this allow to check easily whether the modified theory of gravity is consistent with einstein s theory in a certain limit , which is sufficient for its compatibility with experiment , it also simplifies the discussion and exclusion of ghosts .",
    "gravitational ghosts are modes of negative kinetic energy in a perturbative expansion of the metric around the minkowski vacuum .",
    "ghosts appear whenever there are quadratic terms in the curvature expansion of the action ; the only exception from this rule is the quadratic gauss - bonnet combination @xmath108 which is a total derivative in four dimensions , and for which , also in higher dimensions , the kinetic terms of the perturbative expansion cancel .    as a consequence of the kinematical construction above , the lagrangian for an action implying partially bounded sectional curvatures should be constructed from a power series @xmath109 with the desired finite convergence radius to enforce non - negative eigenvalues for @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , the theory should be ghost - free .",
    "it is natural to use the same power series for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , i.e. , for @xmath110 , in constructing the dynamics .",
    "hence , the lagrangian should be built from the expression @xmath111 where the minus sign between the sums is dictated by the requirement of ghost - freedom .",
    "this is the only possible way to achieve ghost - freedom in the proposed setup : contractions of the riemann tensor in petrov notation can never yield the ricci tensor which appears in the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "note that the cancellation of the ghosts automatically kills an otherwise possible cosmological constant term which , however , could again be included by hand without inconsistency .",
    "because of their absolute convergence , the two series may be rearranged , and they collapse to @xmath112 the simplest way to build a scalar action from the above expression is to act on it with the linear integral - trace functional , to obtain @xmath113 this is then seen to be a direct generalisation of einstein s theory , where @xmath114 for @xmath115 .",
    "so one particular action whose solutions by construction have bounded sectional curvature ( on all planes in the riemannian case , and on certain subvarieties in the lorentzian case ) could be taken as @xmath116 the equations of motion are derived in the usual manner by variation with respect to the spacetime metric @xmath117 : they present a system of fourth - order partial differential equations . in the limit @xmath118 , this action reproduces the einstein - hilbert action up to a constant that can be divided out .",
    "the same limit simplifies the equations of motion to yield einstein s vacuum equations @xmath119 .",
    "although the action ( [ eq . genaction ] ) appears to be the mathematically most straightforward one , we could have made several alternative choices in the construction .",
    "another obvious choice would have been to take a determinant instead of a trace .",
    "it is also possible first to make scalars out of the power series for @xmath110 and then to subtract .",
    "this would lead , for instance , to the action @xmath120 the first part of this expression is almost of the form as has been considered in @xcite .",
    "there are , however , two important differences here .",
    "firstly , the inclusion of the second term bounds the value of the sectional curvatures ( on the planes that can be linearly combined solely from spacelike or timelike eigenvectors of @xmath41 ) additionally from below , and , notably , this removes the ghosts as well .",
    "secondly , it is important to take the square root of the matrix first and then the determinant , because this is what constrains the eigenvalues of @xmath41 when only real solutions are considered .",
    "our construction of gravity theories with partially bounded sectional curvatures features a fundamental length scale , appearing in the constant @xmath39 which has the dimension length squared .",
    "hence , one expects that gravitational dynamics respecting that scale should lead to solutions very different from those of general relativity , especially on scales which are small compared to @xmath121 .",
    "such a crucial change in the short distance behaviour should also be mirrored in structural differences . to show that this is indeed the case , we need to briefly review the kinematics associated to dirac - born - infeld theory .",
    "the singularities of maxwell electrodynamics , most prominently the divergence of the electric field energy density of a point charge , prompted born and infeld in @xcite to devise a nonlinear theory of electrodynamics , which regulates this divergence by the introduction of a parameter @xmath39 of dimension length squared . in string theory , the corresponding action emerges @xcite as the low energy effective action of a @xmath122 gauge field @xmath123 , with corresponding field strength @xmath124 , on a @xmath125-brane @xmath126 , @xmath127 this theory is manifestly invariant under worldvolume diffeomorphisms of the @xmath128-dimensional lorentzian manifold @xmath126 , and hence possesses a local @xmath129 lorentz symmetry .",
    "the feature of a finite length scale in ( [ dbi ] ) , however , has profound structural consequences .",
    "based on the observation that this action only depends on even powers of the electromagnetic field strength @xmath130 , it has been shown in @xcite that there is a hidden dynamical invariance , extending the local invariance group to a product group , @xmath131 into which the lorentz symmetry group is diagonally embedded .",
    "an investigation of the kinematical meaning of the product group , acting on curves in the frame bundle , shows that it contains , apart from the standard lorentz transformations , transformations to arbitrarily rotating and accelerated frames , whose covariant acceleration for non - rotating observers is bounded by the inverse of the length scale , @xmath132 .",
    "as much as the extension of the rotation group @xmath133 to @xmath134 captures the dynamical symmetries of maxwell theory due to the existence of a fundamental speed , the extension ( [ embed ] ) is implied by the existence of a fundamental squared length scale @xmath39 in dirac - born - infeld theory . that the extended group also captures the regulation of born - infeld theory is further illustrated by the following fact :",
    "if one defines particles in quantum field theory as the irreducible representations of a corresponding doubling of the poincare group , then every particle automatically is accompanied by a pauli - villars regulating weyl ghost @xcite .",
    "these insights are intimately linked to the findings of the present paper : in the previous chapter , we have seen that the criterion of ghost - freedom for gravity theories with partially bounded sectional curvatures leads to actions of the type ( [ eq .",
    "genaction ] ) , to which solely odd powers of the riemann tensor , viewed as an endomorphism on @xmath47 , contribute .",
    "hence one can show in close technical analogy to @xcite that gravitational ghost - freedom can be understood as singling out those theories that possess a hidden invariance ( [ embed ] ) . in turn",
    ", the extended structure group @xmath135 appears not only to capture the regulation of born - infeld theory , but also the absence of ghosts there , and transfers this property to curvature regulated gravity theories in our sense .",
    "_ in summary , we arrive at the remarkable fact that ghost - free gravity theories with tidal acceleration bounds , as constructed in the preceding sections , automatically imply kinematics that put an upper bound of the same value @xmath132 on covariant accelerations as well . _    these structural insights",
    "justify the classification of the gravity theories presented in this paper as of ` born - infeld type ' .",
    "the appeal of the geometrical construction scheme presented here is the characterisation of a spacetime with partially bounded sectional curvatures , and hence , partially bounded geodesic deviation accelerations , by a simple algebraic property of the riemann tensor : the endomorphisms @xmath41 should be diagonalisable and have real non - negative eigenvalues . even without considering specific gravitational dynamics",
    "this has interesting consequences , valid for the whole class of theories constructed here .",
    "two applications will be considered : for asymptotically flat , static , spherically symmetric spacetimes we will show the non - existence of spacelike singularities , and a discussion of pp - wave backgrounds will illustrate some limitations of the proposed scheme .",
    "the first application considers pp - wave spacetimes ( plane - fronted waves with parallel rays ) which are defined by the existence of a covariantly constant null killing vector field @xmath136 .",
    "the line element can be written in the form @xmath137 and it can be shown that in these spacetimes all curvature invariants vanish @xcite .",
    "this holds , in particular , for the invariants @xmath138 , \\quad \\textrm{for}\\ , \\ , n\\in \\mathbb { n}\\ , , \\ ] ] which determine the eigenvalues of @xmath41 since they appear as the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial in equation ( [ eq .",
    "charpol ] ) . for the pp - wave spacetimes ,",
    "the eigenvalue equation becomes @xmath139 , and so all eigenvalues equal @xmath140 , as is the case for minkowski space .",
    "this also means that the riemann tensor , although it is non - trivial , is nilpotent .",
    "more explicitly , in four dimensions and in petrov notation using the labelling @xmath141,[ux^{1}],[ux^{2}],[vx^{1}],[vx^{2}],[x^{1}x^{2}])\\equiv ( 1,\\ , ... \\ , , 6 ) $ ] , one finds the nonzero components @xmath142 this riemann tensor is not diagonalisable by a local @xmath143 transformation , since it does not admit an eigenvector basis for @xmath47 .",
    "but because the riemann tensor is nilpotent with @xmath144 , the pp - waves are solutions of any theory constructed within our framework , as they solve einsteins theory on the remaining first order level of the curvature expansion , compare ( [ eq .",
    "genaction ] ) .",
    "the polarisation of the waves may diverge and lead to ` null - singularities ' .",
    "these singularities appear in the tidal forces given by the geodesic deviation equation and have been argued to be unavoidable in any theory of gravity whose lagrangian depends only on the metric , covariant derivatives and the riemann tensor @xcite . in particular , our construction does not escape that conclusion .",
    "the second , particularly nice example considers static , spherically symmetric solutions in four dimensions with a spacetime ansatz of the form @xmath145 where @xmath123 and @xmath146 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate @xmath147 and @xmath148 gives the standard line element on the unit two - sphere .",
    "now we establish sectional curvature bounds in the sense of section [ sec .",
    "lorentzian ] , by assuming that the endomorphisms @xmath41 , which are already diagonal in the adjoint basis induced by the schwarzschild coordinates , have non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "one of these eigenvalues is algebraic in @xmath146 .",
    "the corresponding condition is @xmath149 and implies that @xmath146 is bounded from below for all @xmath147 by the function @xmath150 and from above , for @xmath151 , by @xmath152 . in particular",
    ", this implies that @xmath146 is strictly positive everywhere and that @xmath153 with slope @xmath154 .",
    "an argument given in @xcite shows that such behaviour of the function @xmath146 is necessary in any theory of gravity on a lorentzian spacetime manifold that regulates the schwarzschild singularity .",
    "the framework presented here obviously passes this test .",
    "when the gravitational equations of motion are constructed from an action principle , there is another implicit requirement to satisfy .",
    "the density @xmath155 in the integrand is only well - defined when @xmath156 everywhere . but as @xmath157 this shows @xmath158 .",
    "already at this point , we see that theories with partially bounded sectional curvatures show a completely different behaviour than does general relativity , where , by birkhoff s theorem , the schwarzschild solution is the unique static , spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat vacuum solution , with @xmath159 for a mass parameter @xmath160 . for positive mass @xmath161",
    ", the schwarzschild spacetime has a horizon at @xmath162 , in whose interior @xmath123 and @xmath146 become negative .",
    "all timelike and null geodesics are trapped behind this horizon , and there is a spacelike singularity at @xmath163 .",
    "in our theories with partially bounded sectional curvature , however , a change of signs in the functions @xmath123 and @xmath146 is forbidden .",
    "hence , hypersurfaces of constant @xmath147 can never be spacelike , such that spacelike singularities are excluded from all possible solutions .",
    "( singularities can only occur at constant radius due to spherical symmetry . )",
    "this mechanism does not prevent the occurrence of timelike singularities or , as seen previously , null singularities .",
    "horizons may still appear in solutions . to see this",
    "more explicitly consider the spherically symmetric spacetimes in which the functions @xmath123 and @xmath146 are finite for all @xmath164 .",
    "when @xmath165 , i.e. , when @xmath123 is strictly positive everywhere , nothing interesting happens .",
    "there are no horizons and the spacetime is conformally equivalent to minkowski space .",
    "now assume that @xmath123 vanishes at an isolated point , @xmath166 .",
    "in the usual manner , it is possible to introduce null coordinates by setting @xmath167 and defining @xmath168 and @xmath169 , where @xmath170 and @xmath171 are constant on outgoing or ingoing radial null geodesics , respectively .",
    "these coordinates allow the continuation of the radial null geodesics across @xmath172 because it takes a finite affine parameter distance @xmath173 to reach this hypersurface from a point @xmath174 , @xmath175 this argument extends and shows the existence of a horizon at @xmath172 which , however , is permeable from both sides .",
    "the carter - penrose diagram of the resulting spacetime is shown in figure [ fig.penrose ] .    finally , let us take a closer look at the planes on which the sectional curvatures are bounded .",
    "we use the petrov notation and the labelling @xmath176,[t\\theta ] , [ t\\phi ] , [ \\theta \\phi ] , [ \\phi r],[r\\theta ] ) = ( 1,\\ , ... \\",
    ", , 6 ) $ ] .",
    "the six - vectors @xmath177 that describe planes then are those which satisfy @xmath178 .",
    "this follows from the choice of basis @xmath179 and @xmath180 which implies @xmath181 the endomorphisms @xmath41 are diagonal in the static spherically symmetric example , as is the tensor @xmath51 , for which @xmath182 the timelike and spacelike eigenvectors of @xmath41 are @xmath183 and @xmath184 , respectively .",
    "the sectional curvature is thus bounded on the subvarieties of all timelike planes described by @xmath185 with @xmath186 ( where the @xmath187 are normalised to avoid overcounting ) .",
    "more explicitly , these planes can be described by an orthonormal basis : given any normalised timelike vector @xmath5 with @xmath188 , we can calculate the second , spacelike basis vector @xmath7 with @xmath189 from ( [ eq .",
    "zform ] ) .",
    "when @xmath190 , we find @xmath191 for any normalised three - vector @xmath192 .",
    "for @xmath193 , we find @xmath194 where @xmath195 all these planes",
    "are easily visualised : they contain the local time axis @xmath196 .",
    "( this is obvious in the first case with @xmath197 , while in the second case it follows from the fact that @xmath198 is parallel to @xmath199 . )",
    "a similar calculation for the spacelike planes shows that among those with bounded sectional curvature are the planes orthogonal to the local time axis , defined by @xmath200 .",
    "in contrast to past attempts to modify einstein s theory of gravity , where the consequences of new actions , differing from the einstein - hilbert action and proposed in a more or less _ ad hoc _ fashion , are analysed , this work has been based on clear - cut geometrical assumptions .",
    "motivated by bounds on the deviation accelerations between nearby geodesics , we have investigated possible bounds on the sectional curvatures of a spacetime , with the aim of potentially improving on the singularity problems of classical general relativity .    in the riemannian case , the sectional curvatures may be bounded for all planes , whereas on the physically relevant lorentzian manifolds , the situation is more involved .",
    "due to the existence of strong rigidity theorems , certain subsets of planes have to be chosen to avoid trivial theories allowing for constant curvature solutions only . a consistent choice of such subsets can be made by demanding that they should form subvarieties of the variety of all possible planes through a given point .",
    "we have shown that the bounds on the sectional curvatures along maximal subvarieties of the set of all planes can be reformulated in a nice algebraic way .",
    "the conditions for these bounds translate into the requirement that certain endomorphisms , which are constructed from the riemann tensor and act on the space of antisymmetric two - tensors , should be diagonalisable by the local orthogonal group and should have non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "in addition to these kinematical results , it has been shown that it is possible to construct ghost - free gravity actions such that the dynamical solutions of their corresponding equations of motion automatically satisfy the sectional curvature bounds .",
    "this is strong evidence that there exist classical gravity theories on lorentzian manifolds that are better - behaved than einstein s theory .",
    "the strengths and limitations of the kinematical framework constructed here have been illustrated by two instructive examples .",
    "the expectation that a regulation , at least for some types of singularities , might be possible has been found justified .",
    "this expectation emerged from the dirac - born - infeld structure of our theories and from earlier results in @xcite , where actions similar to those obtained here had been investigated . in spherically symmetric spacetimes in four dimensions , without even considering specific dynamics , it has been shown that there can not be spacelike singularities , which is a very strong result , as it applies to the whole class of curvature regulated theories in our sense .",
    "another application to pp - wave spacetimes explains why null singularities can not be removed in our theories .",
    "a new fundamental length scale appears as an important ingredient in the construction .",
    "we have shown that the appearance of the length scale here is intimately linked to its rle in dirac - born - infeld theory @xcite .",
    "the covariant acceleration of non - geodesic observers turns out to be bounded by the same value that one chooses to impose on tidal accelerations .",
    "it would be interesting to understand the thereby established relations to other theories with fundamental length scales , such as , for example , string theory or quantum gravity , which all predict modifications of general relativity .",
    "a study of exact , or numerical , solutions of specific gravitational dynamics constructed within our framework will allow to constrain the possible range for the length scale parameter from comparison with observations .",
    "our investigations here indicate the emergence of at least one further generic feature besides the finite , fundamental length scale : the existence of curvature corrections to all orders seems to be an essential ingredient in order to regulate gravity .",
