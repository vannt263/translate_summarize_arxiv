    "<S> it is shown that the exotic non-@xmath0 hadrons of pentaquark @xmath1 states can be clearly distinguished from the conventional @xmath0-baryon resonances or their hybrids if the flavor of @xmath2 is different from any of the other four quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the physical process @xmath3 , which can be investigated at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) , as an ideal process to search for the existence or non - existence of the exotic hadron of minimal pentaquark state @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> +    the quark model@xcite has been proved to be remarkably successful in classifying the mesons and baryons as composite systems of quark - antiquark ( @xmath5 ) states for mesons and three quark ( @xmath0 ) states for baryons.@xcite also , it has been well known that the structure of hadrons should be more complicated than the simple lowest valence quark states , and there are additional sea quark - antiquark pairs and gluons inside the hadrons probed by various deep inelastic processes . </S>",
    "<S> the situation can be well illustrated by the structure of the nucleon in terms of quark - gluon components as supported by a large number of phenomenological evidence . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the higher quark - gluon components in the nucleon structure can be described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) for the perturbative aspect and perhaps by the baryon - meson fluctuation configuration@xcite for some of the non - perturbative aspects . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a conventional baryon should be composed of various quark - gluon configurations in which the lowest is the three quark ( @xmath0 ) state . from another point of view , there have been various theoretical and experimental investigations on the possibility of the existence of exotic hadrons beyond the conventional quark model spectroscopy , such as multiquark mesons ( @xmath6 ) and baryons ( @xmath1 ) , dibaryons ( @xmath7 ) , hybrid states ( @xmath8 ) , and glueballs.@xcite the present situation seems to be very promising for the existence of the hybrid states and glueballs . </S>",
    "<S> though much progress has been made and many candidates for the other exotic hadrons have been reported , the existence of the exotic hadrons of multiquark states is still far from being clear , due to the difficulty to clearly distinguish candidates from a large number of various possible meson and baryon resonances .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we will focus our attention on the exotic hadrons composed of five quarks , i.e. , a new class of particles of minimal pentaquark ( @xmath1 ) states . </S>",
    "<S> there have been several candidates for the pentaquark states , such as @xmath9,@xcite the possible existence of the pentaquark baryons of hidden strangeness @xmath10 and @xmath11,@xcite and several possible narrow states which might be pentaquark states.@xcite the @xmath9 has been confirmed to exist,@xcite but it is still not clear whether it is a three quark @xmath12 state resonance or a baryon - meson state.@xcite the existence of several other possible pentaquark states still needs to be confirmed . </S>",
    "<S> although these possible particles may have properties different from conventional @xmath0-baryon , it is difficult to identify them unambiguously from possible baryon resonances or their hybrids . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the pentaquark ( @xmath1 ) states with the antiquark @xmath2 having different flavor from any of the other four quarks have the unique property of no place in the spectroscopy of the @xmath0-baryon quark model , and can not be misidentified with any of the baryon resonances or hybrids . </S>",
    "<S> thus , they might be helpful to clarify the present situation concerning @xmath9 and to confirm the existence of the pentaquark states if any evidence for such a hadron can be observed .    for simplicity , we will consider the pentaquark ( @xmath1 ) states as composite systems of baryon - meson states , inspired by our understanding of the non - perturbative sea quark - antiquark pairs of the nucleon in terms of baryon - meson fluctuations.@xcite although the baryon - meson states can not fully accommodate all possible pentaquark states , it will be sufficient as a first approximation to see whether it provides the hint for a new class of particles . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out@xcite that the lowest baryon - meson fluctuations of the nucleon can provide a comprehensive understanding of a number of empirical anomalies , such as the violation of the gottfried sum rule@xcite , the large excess of charm quarks at large bjorken @xmath13,@xcite the strange quark - antiquark distribution asymmetry,@xcite and the violation of the ellis - jaffe sum rule.@xcite thus any of the conventional baryons in the quark model should have an important part of baryon - meson components beyond the three valence quark @xmath0-states . </S>",
    "<S> such baryon - meson fluctuations are of non - perturbative nature and can be handled by models at the moment , but their existence can be verified and studied from various experiments . </S>",
    "<S> there are also theoretical studies which show that the @xmath9 may be dominated by baryon - meson terms in the wavefunctions.@xcite also it has been found that there is increasing empirical support for an @xmath14-baryon octet of @xmath15 states associated with the @xmath16-wave @xmath17 [ @xmath18 , @xmath19 [ @xmath20 , @xmath21 [ @xmath22 threshold interactions.@xcite these results naturally inspire us to consider the possible existence of a new class of particles in terms of baryon - meson states . </S>",
    "<S> some of these baryon - meson states can be served as the intrinsic quark - antiquark sea components in the ordinary @xmath0-baryons and they mix with the ordinary baryons , but we will show that some pentaquark ( @xmath1 ) states in terms of meson - baryon states can not find their place in the conventional three quark ( @xmath0 ) baryon spectroscopy .    </S>",
    "<S> we notice that in case the antiquark has the same flavor ( e.g. , @xmath23 ) with any of the other four quarks in the pentaquark @xmath24 state , such pentaquark state may be easily identified with the three quark state of @xmath25-baryon resonance , from the above knowledge that any baryon of @xmath25 valence states may have higher quark components of @xmath24 states . </S>",
    "<S> we also notice that all of the previous reported candidates of pentaquark states belong to such @xmath24 states with hidden flavor @xmath23 , thus they are difficult to be distinguished from possible @xmath25-baryon resonances with exotic properties . </S>",
    "<S> a completely unambiguous way of identifying a pentaquark @xmath1 state is that the antiquark @xmath2 having flavor different from any of the other four quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that such pentaquark states can not exist in the quark model @xmath0-baryon spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , they have the unique property of minimal configuration @xmath1 to be distinguished from the conventional baryons .    </S>",
    "<S> such minimal pentaquark states composed of the light flavor up ( @xmath26 ) and down ( @xmath27 ) quarks can only exist in two possible states : @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which can be considered as composite systems of @xmath30 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is not easy to find good processes which can produce such particles conveniently . </S>",
    "<S> there are more such minimal pentaquark states composed of three flavor @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath32 ( strange ) quarks ( but with only one @xmath33 or @xmath32 quark ) : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . when consider them in terms of baryon - meson states , those in which the baryon is the nucleon should be : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> from which we notice that the minimal pentaquark states which can be easily measured might be @xmath41 and @xmath44 , which might be produced from physical processes @xmath3 and @xmath45 which can be measured at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility(jlab ) . </S>",
    "<S> as far as we know , there have been theoretical studies on the properties of the pentaquark states in the mit bag model@xcite and in other frameworks.@xcite the pentaquark states we suggest to measure are the ones with strangeness number @xmath46 ( i.e. , with an anti - strange quark inside the hadron ) , a distinct quantum number that can not be possessed by ordinary baryons in the conventional quark model spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> there have been also suggestions for the possible existence of other exotic multiquark states , such as @xmath47 and @xmath48 with both strangeness and charm.@xcite however , there is still no convincing experimental evidence for the existence of the above mentioned minimal pentaquark states such as @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> there should be a number of physical processes that could in principle produce the minimal pentaquark state @xmath4 , such as @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 _ et al._. the @xmath3 process at jlab is ideal for this physics because of the large luminosity that can be obtained and the fine resolutions of the spectrometers . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the continuous - wave electron beam significantly enhances the signal to background ratio for coincidence measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage at jlab is that there is no need to build new detector to search for the new particle @xmath4 , since the existence or non - existence of @xmath4 can be re - constructed using the missing mass technique by detecting the scattered electron and the final state @xmath52 in coincidence . </S>",
    "<S> we do not need to know the explicit properties , such as the life time , width , mass , spin , parity , and decay modes _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ for detecting such particle .    </S>",
    "<S> we now estimate the probability of producing @xmath4 from the proton target by employing the baryon - meson fluctuation model of the nucleon sea.@xcite we check the probability of finding the quark configuration of @xmath35 and @xmath53 inside the proton . from the discussion of the strangeness content of the nucleon sea,@xcite we know that the lowest baryon - meson fluctuation of the strange quark - antiquark pairs is @xmath54 and the probability of finding such fluctuation should be on the order 3% . </S>",
    "<S> we also know from the gottfried sum rule violation@xcite that the dominant baryon - meson fluctuation of the proton is @xmath55 and the probability of finding such fluctuation should be on the order 15%.@xcite from the su(3 ) symmetry of octet baryons , we can estimate the probability of finding the baryon - meson fluctuation @xmath56 inside @xmath57 as around 10% . </S>",
    "<S> thus the probability of finding the baryon - meson - meson fluctuation @xmath58 of the proton should be around @xmath59 from a convolution picture , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ gm1f1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> when the @xmath60 is knocked out by the incident electron beam , the left spectator should be of the quark configuration @xmath61 , which is the same as that of the pentaquark state @xmath4 . from above discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we can estimate the cross section for the process @xmath3 by largest as around 0.1 times that of the process @xmath62 by removing the kinematical factors , provided with the assumption that the left spectator keeps as a single state particle @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the real situation might be not so optimistic as the best case estimated above .    </S>",
    "<S> since the five quarks of @xmath4 might be grouped into clusters rather than confined inside a bag , we still have difficulty predicting the mass of the minimal pentaquark state @xmath4 , and it is likely below or slightly above the threshold of two free particle state of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 mev , if such particle can exist in the laboratory . if the mass of @xmath4 is above @xmath65 mev , such particle should have a short life time and a broad width . also there should be large background contribution above the threshold of @xmath66 to the @xmath3 process . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the resolutions required for the experiment on @xmath4 are high . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , the new particle @xmath4 might also be possible to be produced and measured in the resonance channel @xmath67 by re - constructing the @xmath4 from the detected final state @xmath64 and @xmath63 , provided with good resolutions . in case @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> is a minimal pentaquark state with configuration @xmath68 or @xmath69,@xcite we may even consider the possibility that @xmath70 is one of the partner particles of @xmath9 and make a clear prediction of its mass @xmath71 mev . </S>",
    "<S> it would be relatively easy to be measured from @xmath3 process if the mass of @xmath4 is below @xmath72 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the possible channels for the background contribution should be @xmath73 and @xmath74 which involve the cabibbo suppressed weak interaction below the threshold of the process @xmath75 , and such contributions are small . </S>",
    "<S> the re - construction of @xmath4 would be clean without significant background contribution . </S>",
    "<S> thus any evidence for or against the existence of @xmath4 might be also helpful in clarifying the situation concerning @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> we can not exclude the possibility that only certain specific pentaquark states , not all of them , can exist in nature . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the existence of @xmath76 is more possible than that of @xmath4 considering the fact that the stable pentaquark states may carry less net charge . </S>",
    "<S> we can extend the study in this direction by systematic exploration of various minimal pentaquark states with configurations pointed out above , such as to search for @xmath76 from the physical process @xmath77 or @xmath78 at jlab . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note a recent suggestion@xcite on the search for such a @xmath76 particle from the @xmath79 reaction by analyzing the @xmath80 invariant mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out here that the search of the existence of the exotic new particle @xmath4 can be combined with the planned program of the physical process of @xmath81 at jlab . </S>",
    "<S> thus the search of new particles @xmath4 and @xmath76 at jlab is not necessarily in conflict with conventional studies , even though the chance of finding such particles might be small . from another point of view , </S>",
    "<S> even the confirmation of the non - existence of @xmath4 and @xmath76 can enrich our understanding of the hadronic structure and the strong interaction .    in summary , we proposed in this letter the idea of the possible existence of exotic hadrons of minimal pentaquark @xmath1 states such as @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the exotic hadrons of pentaquark @xmath1 states can not find place in the conventional quark model spectroscopy of @xmath0-baryons if the flavor of @xmath2 is different from any of the other four quarks , thus such minimal pentaquark states can be clearly identified as a new class of particles if there is any evidence for the existence . </S>",
    "<S> we also discussed the possible configurations for such minimal pentaquark states and pointed out that @xmath4 might be identified . </S>",
    "<S> we suggested the physical process @xmath3 , which can be studied at jlab , as an ideal process to search for the existence or non - existence of the exotic pentaquark hadron @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of a search for the @xmath76 state from the physical process @xmath82 or @xmath83 at jlab is also pointed out . </S>",
    "<S> further theoretical and experimental explorations are required to support or rule out the existence of such exotic minimal pentaquark states which have no place in the conventional @xmath0-baryon spectroscopy . </S>"
