    "heavy fermion materials pose one of the greatest challenges in condensed matter physics . their low ",
    "temperature linear specific heat coefficient can be up to 1000 times larger than the value expected from the free  electron theory ; their magnetic moments can be screened by the kondo effect and their electrical resistivity is frequently divergent but sometimes superconductivity can emerge at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) in its popular local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite fail to reproduce strongly renormalized electronic masses in heavy fermion materials due to improper treatment of many  body correlation effects .",
    "consider , for example , a well  known class cerium class of heavy fermion materials , such as two famous phases ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) of cerium itself panousis1970,johansson1974,allen1982 , so called ce115s systems : cexin@xmath2 ( x = co , rh , ir ) @xcite and numerous ce122 compounds liang1988,mihalik , nakamoto2004,lu2005,steglich1979,hunt1990,harima1991,steglich1985,thompson1985,besnus1985,graf1997,dhar1987,steeman1988 : cex@xmath3si@xmath3 ( x = mn , fe , co , ni , cu , ru , rh , pd , ag ) .",
    "a table 1 gives evaluated via lda  densities of states specific heat coefficients @xmath1 for these materials as compared to experiments , where in many cases a factor of 220 error exists in underestimating @xmath1 while in some cases , such , e.g. , as ceco@xmath3si@xmath3 , an overestimation occurs .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to show that a better treatment of electronic correlations via a recently introduced gutzwiller density functional theory @xcite can correct most of these errors and uncover which exactly orbitals become heavy as is also illustrated in table i.    the physics of the electronic mass enhancement is controlled by a low frequency behavior of the local electronic self  energy which can be encoded in a simple teilor like form@xmath4where we assume , for simplicity , the existence of some crystal field representation @xmath5 that diagonalizes the self  energy matrix in a spin  orbital space of the localized f electrons .",
    "this expression suggests two main effects that may occur when correlations are brought into consideration on top of a band theory such as lda : first the crystal field correction to a local f ",
    "electron level is controlled by @xmath6 and , second , the actual band narrowing is controlled by a quasiparticle residue parameter @xmath7 both effects would affect our comparisons of @xmath1 in table 1 .",
    "recently , advanced many body approaches based on combinations of density functional  and dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) have been implemented @xcite to study heavy fermion systems @xcite where self  consistent solutions of either anderson or kondo impurity problems have been done using most accurate continues time quantum monte carlo method @xcite . while dmft deals with full frequency dependent self  energy and is a lot more computationally demanding than traditional lda , it taught us an important lesson on the so called orbital selectivity in the mott transition problem , i.e. when crystal field dependent self  energies can reduce effective degeneracy of the impurity .",
    "this affects the proximity of the quasiparticle residue @xmath8 to become equal zero when the ratio between hubbard @xmath9 and bandwidth @xmath10 changes .    a recently introduced gutzwiller density functional theory ( gdft ) and the so called lda+g method @xcite is a simplified variational approach that relies on the gutzwiller approximation initially introduced to study itinerant ferromagnetism of the one  band hubbard model   @xcite , and later extended to multi  band systems bunemann1997,bunemann1998 .",
    "in this method , the atomic configurations of correlated orbitals are treated by adjusting their weights using a variational procedure .",
    "this leads to renormalized energy bands and mass enhancements for the electrons .",
    "the approximation was extensively studied in the limit of infinite dimensions  @xcite , and was shown to be equivalent to a slave  boson mean  field theory  kotliar1986 for both single  band and multiband models  gebhard1991,lechermann2007,bunemann2007 . in lda+g , the gutzwiller type trial wave function @xmath11 is adopted with @xmath12 and @xmath13 being the lda ground state and the gutzwiller projector respectively .",
    "after further application of the gutzwiller approximation , an effective hamiltonian describing the dynamics of quasiparticles was obtained as @xmath14 , which contains two important features discussed above : the modification of the crystal / spin  orbital fields and the quasiparticle weight @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the method exactly casts the effect encoded into the low  frequency behavior of @xmath16 , eq .",
    "the benchmark of the lda+g scheme was demonstrated in ref .  .",
    "for a non ",
    "magnetic correlated metal @xmath17 , it produced narrower bands and larger effective masses than those found in standard lda .",
    "also the method was able to get a photoemission peak missed in the lda calculation .",
    "these improvements are very close to the experimental results .",
    "later , in ref .   a complex phase diagram of @xmath18 was correctly reproduced .",
    "recently , this method has been successfully applied to feas  based superconductors  @xcite and to ce metal tian2011,kotliarce .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     in this work we address the physics of cerium heavy fermion materials via the use of the lda+g approach . a great spread in the extracted values of mass enhancements data shown in table i together with some unphysical values of @xmath19",
    "prompts us that in many classes of real compounds both the orbital selectivity encoded via the shifts @xmath20 on top of the ldaas well as the quasiparticle residues play an important role and have to be treated on the same footing .",
    "it therefore represents a stringiest test of a many body electronic structure method such as lda+g to heavy fermion materials .",
    "in particular , in its recent application to elemental cerium kotliarce , it has been shown that the spin ",
    "orbital splitting of the f  level is renormalized by correlations and pushes energies of the j=7/2 manifold up relative to j=5/2 states@xmath21 this resulted in lowering the degeneracy from 14 to 6 and in a greater mass enhancement of j=5/2 manifold as compared to a non  spin orbit coupled calculation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the lda+g method is described .",
    "the results for several typical families of heavy fermion materials are presented in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv is the conclusion .",
    "the gutzwiller density functional theory and the lda+g approximation have been described previously @xcite . here",
    "we merely summarize the equations of the method that we implement using a linear muffin  tin orbital formalism that includes both the full potential terms and relatvistic spin ",
    "orbit coupling operator variationally fplmto .",
    "we first illustrate the method using a general multi  orbital hubbard model .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath22where @xmath23 is the spin ",
    "orbital index of the localized orbital , @xmath24 is the number of orbitals , e.g. 7 for the @xmath25orbital .",
    "the first term is a tight  binding hamiltonian which can be extracted from the lda calculation .",
    "the second term is the on  site interaction which has been restricted to the density  density interaction .    in the atomic limit ,",
    "for the localized orbital there are @xmath26 different states which can be either occupied or empty .",
    "therefore there is total @xmath27 configurations @xmath28 .",
    "all these configurations form a complete basis and the density ",
    "density interaction is diagonal in this configuration space .",
    "it is obvious that these configurations should not be equally weighted . in the gutzwiller method",
    ", we adjust the weight of each configuration .",
    "therefore it is convenient to construct projection operators that project onto a specific configuration @xmath29 at site @xmath30 : @xmath31    when the interaction term is absent , the ground state is the hatree uncorrelated wave function ( hwf ) @xmath32 which is a slater determinant of the single  particle states .",
    "when the interaction is switched on , this wave function is no longer a good approximation . in the gutzwiller method",
    ", we project the wave function to a gutzwiller wave function ( gwf ) @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) : @xmath35where @xmath36notice that when all @xmath37 the gwf is going back to hwf . at the same time , setting @xmath38 removes configuration @xmath39 at site @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , perfectly localized atomic state of site @xmath30 is described by all @xmath38 except for one , and in this way , the gutzwiller wave function captures both the itinerant and localized behavior of the system .",
    "it is a difficult task to evaluate gwf .",
    "however , within the gutzwiller method , we can map any operator @xmath40 acting on the gwf to a corresponding effective @xmath41 which acts on the hwf : @xmath42where @xmath43specifically , when the operator @xmath44 is a single  particle operator , e.g. @xmath45 where @xmath46where @xmath47 are the orbital  dependent quasiparticle residues : @xmath48 these are determined by the configuration weights : @xmath49where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the occupation numbers for the orbitals .",
    "similar to the idea of the lda+u or lda+dmft methods , we add the interaction term on top of the lda calculation .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath52where @xmath53 is the lda hamiltonian , which casts the same form as @xmath54 in eq.([hub ] ) , @xmath55 is the on  site interaction term for the set of correlated orbitals , such as @xmath25orbitals of heavy ",
    "fermion materials considered in this work . since the lda calculation has already included the coulomb interaction in some averaged level , we need to subtract the double  counting term @xmath56 from lda .",
    "various forms of @xmath57 will be discussed later .    the kohn  sham approach uses a non  interacting system as a reference which keeps the same density as the interacting one . however , now our ground state is the gwf instead of the hwf .",
    "therefore , we need to transform the hamiltonian into the effective one in the @xmath32 basis . since the hamiltonian @xmath58 is a single  particle operator , following ref .",
    "we obtain    @xmath59    where @xmath60represents a complete basis set of the correlated orbitals , and where we omit site index @xmath30 from the quasiparticle residues @xmath61due to lattice periodicity .",
    "the interaction term acting on the gwf produces : @xmath62    the expectation value of the total hamiltonian gives us the total energy as a functional of the density @xmath63 and confugurational weights @xmath64 : @xmath65    a minimization similar to lda is now performed .",

    "it is convinient to represent all matrices in the space of the bloch eigenvalues @xmath70 and wave functions @xmath71 that are obtained from the lda calculation .",
    "the gutzwiller hamiltonian to be diagonalized is given by    @xmath72    where a subset of correlated orbitals @xmath73 is introduced .",
    "their levels are given by@xmath74the quasiparticle residues @xmath15 and the level shifts @xmath75 are obtained using the gutzwiller procedure @xcite .",
    "the double counting potential @xmath76 corrects for the fact that the lda already accounts for some of the correlation effects in a mean field manner .",
    "the eigenvalue problem    @xmath77    produces renormalized energy bands @xmath78 and wave functions @xmath79 of the quasiparticles@xmath21      in order to find a new density , we calculate a gutzwiller density matrix operator in the lda representation    @xmath80    where @xmath81diagonalizing it produces new occupation numbers @xmath82 @xmath83so that the density of quasiparticles in real space is given by@xmath84      to see the importance of the issue , let us examine a shift of the lda eigenstates @xmath70 by arbitrary value @xmath85 .",
    "we obtain the new gutzwiller hamiltonian as the old one plus the correction@xmath86where @xmath87 is a matrix that can be proved to be equal to @xmath88 only under the assumption that the lda wave functions form a mathematically complete basis set , i.e.@xmath89unfortunately , modern electronic structure methods deal with finite basis sets , and the last relationship is only approximately satisfied . as a result , different choices of energy zero for the lda eigenvalues @xmath90 may lead to slightly different output , although in our application to well  localized cerium 4f electrons , this introduces only minor noise in our calculated results . in the following",
    ", we always assume that the lda eigenvalues are measured with respect to the fermi energy which is the only physically relevant energy in this problem .      as one sees from eq.([ham ] )",
    "the actual self  energy correction used in the lda+g calculation is @xmath91 frequently , a so called lda+u version @xcite of double counting potential @xmath92 is used , that for our case is just an orbital  independent energy shift given by @xmath93where @xmath94 is the average number of f electrons which at ce f  shell is close to unity .",
    "as one sees , this correction has just an overall level shift by @xmath95 and does not modify the gutzwiller extracted spin  orbit and crystal fields encoded in the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath96 unfortunately , it is not exactly clear whether the overall level shift of ce f electrons has a physical effect , since the standard lda+u double counting was introduced in connection to the hartree fock value of the self  energy which is the value at infinite frequency , @xmath97 .",
    "it therefore may not be suited for correcting low energy physics of the heavy fermion systems .    as a result ,",
    "in this work we adopt a different strategy in order to elucidate the physics of orbital selectivity in ce heavy fermion compounds : our calculations are first performed without @xmath98 correction assuming that the double counting potential @xmath99it has an important justification that the lda  calculated fermi surfaces do not acquire any modifications as was the past evidence for some heavy fermion uranium compounds@xcite .",
    "second , we introduce the crystal field averaged double counting @xmath100which keeps the average position of the f  level intact but allows for its crystal field modifications found self ",
    "consistently via the lda+g procedure . since both @xmath101 and @xmath102 rely on gutzwiller extracted @xmath103 which itself is obtained from the lda+g functional minimization procedure , the entire method is still variational and allows an accurate estimate of the total energy . comparing calculations with two types of double counting , important conclusions can be drawn on which exactly orbitals of a given heavy fermion system play a major role in its electronic mass enhancement .",
    "we are interested in calculating the mass enhancement parameters of cerium f electrons which in a simple single band theory would be given by the ratio of @xmath104 . a common approach to extract",
    "this data is to compare the values of the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath1 evaluated using the ldadensity of states at the fermi level @xmath105@xmath106with the measured electronic specific heat which , according to the fermi liquid theory , behaves at low temperatures as @xmath107 .",
    "however , some care should be taken when adopting this procedure .",
    "first , densities of states of real systems include muliband features and contributions from both heavy and light electrons .",
    "second , lda densities of states assume some crystal field effects which should in general be supplemented by many body corrections encoded in @xmath108 therefore not only band narrowing but also level shifts are expected to occur in real life on top of lda .",
    "third , many of the materials discussed in our work undergo either antiferromagnetic or superconducting transition before reaching @xmath109 limit .",
    "we quote the data for @xmath110 in table i using the data for their lowest temperature paramagnetic phases .",
    "there are several other ways to access this information that we are going to use in this work .",
    "optical spectroscopy experiments can provide access to effective masses but those are frequency dependent . angle ",
    "resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments measure directly one  electron spectral functions @xmath111here @xmath112 is the real part and @xmath113 is the imaginary part of the electronic self  energy . under the assumption of the locality of self  energy , the quasiparticle residues @xmath114can be extracted by comparing arpes spectra against calculated lda energy bands .    the dhva effect is another powerful experimental technique which measures the properties of the fermi surface properties under applied magnetic field  @xcite . lda calculation can identify each cyclotron orbit seen by the dhva experiment and find corresponding effective masses .",
    "however , complexity in shapes of 3d fermi surfaces in real systems also makes this method not perfect .",
    "it is remarkable that the lda+g calculation returns the orbital dependent quasiparticle residues @xmath15 directly . in table",
    "i , we are quoting these mass enhancement data and _ not _ the ones obtained via our calculated lda+g densities of states .",
    "we first discuss our calculations for cerium metal which is famous for its iso  structural phase transition from its @xmath0 to @xmath1 phase that is accompanied by 15% of its volume expansion , and has attracted great attention in the pastjohansson1974,allen1982,zolfl2001,held2001,haule2005,amadon2006 and current@xcite literature .",
    "it is remarkable that our lda+g calculation can correct most of the error in predicting the volume of the @xmath0 phase for both types of the double countings that we explore in this work .",
    "moreover , as fig .",

    "this is in accord with the previous previous lda+dmft studies for cerium @xcite .",
    "similar behavior has been also found when studying @xmath119 transition in metallic plutonium @xcite .",
    "the specific heat measurement of @xmath0ce gives its sommerfeld coefficient @xmath120 mj/(mol@xmath121 ) .",
    "the optical spectroscopy experiment  @xcite estimates the effective mass to be @xmath122 in @xmath0ce and to be @xmath123 in @xmath1ce , indicating the itinerant / localized features of the @xmath117 phases",
    ". however , the estimated optical effective masses are frequency dependent .    fig .",
    "[ cerium ] shows the dependence of the quasiparticle residues as a function of the hubbard u for volumes corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath124ce where the left / right plots represent our calculations with @xmath125 type of double countings .",
    "it is clear when crystal / spin  orbital corrections are not taken into account ( left plot ) , the effective masses for various cerium orbitals are very similar in values and are not very strongly enhanced even for large values of u. ( we use relativistic cubic harmonics representation where @xmath126 level is split onto @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 onto @xmath130 states . )",
    "the situation changes dramatically when we account for the local self  energy correction ( right plot ) : a coulomb renormalized spin ",
    "orbit splitting pushes @xmath131 states of @xmath126 manifold down and @xmath132 states of @xmath129 manifold up .",
    "this results in redistributing the occupancies of the f  electrons which now reside mainly at @xmath126 level .",
    "thus , the effective degeneracy is 6 instead of 14 and the quasiparticle residues become much more sensitive to the values of u.     and @xmath133 phases of cerium metal using the lda+g approach . ]",
    "actual comparison of the quasiparticle residues with experiment needs an accurate estimate of the hubbard u for cerium f  electrons which is typically around 5 ev , although , if the hunds rule @xmath1341ev ( important for the  virtual f@xmath135 state ) is taken into account , the effective interaction is reduced a little bit to @xmath136 due to a great sensitivity of quasiparticle residues to this parameter , and for the purposes of our work , we simply show in table i the range of @xmath8 s that one can obtain for the values of u in the range between 4 and 5 ev . for @xmath0ce we find them between 0.55 and 0.33 which are close to their experimental estimates .",
    "this is also consistent with the result of the lda+dmft calculation  @xcite .",
    "while there is no specific heat data for the @xmath1 phase , optical measurements @xcite show a factor of 34 enhanced masses as compared to the ones of the @xmath0 phase@xmath137 and our reduced values of @xmath138s are in accord with this trend .",

    "this is similar to our findings in ce and ce115 systems .",
    "our calculation for cu based 122 shows that its quasiparticle residues are very sensitive to the values of u above 4 ev .",
    "in fact , it is beginning to reach almost zero values when u approaches 5 ev .",

    "the 122 compounds with 4d elements ( ru , rh , pd , ag ) exhibit strongly renormalized quasiparticle masses .",
    "our lda+g calculations listed in table i correctly follow this trend where we see a strong reduction of z s as compared to our calculations with 3d elements .",
    "we also find another interesting effect : with increasing u the effective degeneracy of the f electrons acquires a reduction not only due to the coulomb assisted renormalization of spin  orbit splitting but also renormalization of the crystal fields : fig .",
    "[ ce122 ] shows this behavior for ru-122 where we see that the values of z become different for various crystal field levels of the @xmath126 manifold : one @xmath206and two @xmath127 doublets .",
    "we find that a similar effect occurs in all other 4d types of ce 122s and the last column of table i lists our results showing which particular orbitals exhibit the strongest mass enhancement .",
    "in conclusion , using a recently proposed lda+g approach we have studied quasiparticle mass renormalizations in several classes of ce heavy fermion compounds .",
    "we find that the calculation gives correct trends across various systems as compared to the measured sommerfeld coefficient and reproduces the order of magnitude of the experimental value .",
    "we also uncover an interesting orbital dependency of the quasiparticle residues for each studied compound which provides an important physical insight on how correlations affect the effective degeneracy of cerium f  electrons placed in various crystallographic environments .",
