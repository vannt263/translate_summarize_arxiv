    "the odderon is the @xmath1 - odd partner of the pomeron , and in qcd it can be represented as a 3-gluon color singlet state .",
    "the small @xmath0 evolution for the odderon was derived long time ago @xcite .",
    "two solutions for the intercept of the odderon are known .",
    "the first one , the janik - wosiek solution @xcite , was obtained from the requirement of the holomorphic symmetry , which has intercept slightly less than unity . the second one , which we will call the blv odderon ( bartels - lipatov - vacca ) @xcite has intercept exactly equal to unity ( this was also confirmed later in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this solution has a special feature , namely that two out of three gluons are in the same position in the transverse plane . since it is @xmath1-odd it is found by selecting odd conformal spins ( denoted further by @xmath2 ) from the spectrum of the leading order bfkl pomeron eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "thus the odderon intercept is dominated by @xmath3 conformal spin for which it is exactly equal to unity .",
    "an interesting question arises @xcite , whether the blv odderon intercept still has intercept equal to unity when the higher order terms are taken into account .",
    "the bfkl pomeron is known to nllx order @xcite , and the corrections are numerically large .    for the odderon",
    "the higher order corrections do not have to be large . roughly speaking",
    "one can argue that because this antisymmetric solution selects the odd conformal spins , the transverse momentum integrals in the kernel should vanish when integrated with the eigenfunctions for which @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the conjugated variable to the transverse momentum .",
    "little more care is needed when considering the running coupling , but a recent analysis @xcite , demonstrated that the blv odderon intercept is not affected .    in this letter , we construct a different argument , which is based on the assumption of the so - called @xmath6 expansion @xcite . here",
    "@xmath6 is the variable mellin conjugated to the energy @xmath7 .",
    "this expansion was used to construct the resummation scheme for the case of the bfkl pomeron .",
    "the basic statement is that in the high energy limit @xmath6 is more natural expansion parameter than @xmath8 .",
    "the lowest order terms in @xmath6 and @xmath8 expansions are identical .",
    "then , in the case when the lowest order is vanishing , the requirement of the existence of such expansion implies that all the higher orders in @xmath8 expansion are vanishing too .",
    "this argument can be further supported by the analysis of the anomalous dimensions . there , a dual @xmath5 expansion can be constructed , which is suitable for the resummation in the collinear regime . since the momentum sum rule forces the anomalous dimensions to vanish to all orders when @xmath9 , the @xmath5 expansion holds .",
    "we also check that the nll bfkl kernel vanishes at @xmath3 and @xmath4 which is consistent with the @xmath6 expansion .",
    "we suggest that the vanishing of the bfkl kernel at this particular point can be associated with the momentum sum rule for the transverse components of the momenta .    in the next section",
    "we formulate the consistency argument based on the @xmath6 expansion .",
    "we conjecture that the bfkl should satisfy a separate momentum sum rule for the transverse components of the momenta . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nllx ] we check that the nllx bfkl intercept calculated from @xcite vanishes for @xmath3 and is thus consistent with the conjectured transverse momentum sum rule the whereas the result @xcite apparently does not vanish . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : oddkc ] we investigate the odderon eigenvalue with the pole shifts due to the kinematical constraints and show that the intercept is still equal to unity , however the diffusion is significantly reduced .",
    "we consider a bfkl equation@xcite in the @xmath6 representation @xmath10 where the integral is over the transverse momentum @xmath11 . here , @xmath12 is the gluon green s function , with @xmath6 being the variable mellin conjugated to logarithm of the energy .",
    "the solution to the above equation is found by performing mellin transform in @xmath11 where one finds the condition @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bfkl kernel eigenvalue , @xmath2 is conformal spin , and @xmath5 is the mellin variable conjugated to @xmath15 .",
    "strong coupling is redefined to be @xmath16 .",
    "the kernel eigenvalue can be expanded in the powers of the strong coupling @xmath17 and using perturbation theory one can find corresponding functions @xmath18 which are independent of @xmath6 . up to now",
    "they are known for @xmath19 .",
    "the concept of the @xmath6 expansion @xcite can be argued as follows .",
    "the regge limit is defined as the asymptotic limit in which @xmath20 , that is the center of mass energy is much larger ( essentially infinite ) than the other scales which characterize the scattering process .",
    "the strong coupling though is a parameter which is not necessarily small in this limit . in that case",
    "the convergence of a perturbative series in @xmath8 as given by ( [ eq : alphasexpand ] ) might not be very fast , which is indeed the case given the size of the nllx corrections .",
    "this leads to the hypothesis that the parameter which better characterizes the expansion in the high energy limit is @xmath6 , which should be small in this case .",
    "therefore one makes the ansatz that the eigenvalue of the kernel in eq .",
    "[ eq : bfkl1 ] posses the following representation@xmath21 with @xmath22    obviously the equation above should give the same value for the resulting intercept .",
    "therefore the two functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are both equal to each other and to the intercept .",
    "the difference is that now since the kernel eigenvalue itself depends on @xmath6 one needs to solve the complicated nonlinear equation in the form ( [ eq : implicit ] ) .",
    "now , given the expansion ( [ eq : alphasexpand ] ) one can get the second one ( [ eq : kerneltilde ] ) which leads to relation @xmath25 which is the @xmath6 expansion @xcite . strictly speaking",
    "the above formula is valid for the case of the fixed coupling .",
    "it can be generalized to include the effects of the running coupling in which case the series is modified by terms proportional to the @xmath26 function and include the differential operator @xmath27 .",
    "additionally we have the lowest order condition , because two terms in the leading order in both expansions have to coincide with each other @xmath28 when going to higher orders in each fixed order in @xmath8 we have corresponding string of terms with different orders in @xmath6 , see @xcite .",
    "as it is clear from ( [ eq : omegaexp ] ) this expansion could become invalid when the eigenvalue @xmath29 .",
    "this is precisely the case for the blv odderon @xcite since at the lowest order @xmath30 therefore , at first sight , this would indicate a complete failure of the @xmath6 expansion argument .",
    "there is however a distinct possibility for the @xmath6 expansion to be reliable even in this case , provided the higher orders vanish too in the following way @xmath31 with the solution @xmath32 to all orders . note , that we can not have the solution @xmath33 since this would imply that the ratios @xmath34 should depend on @xmath35 which is forbidden by construction .",
    "the situation described above is completely analogous to the properties of the anomalous dimensions .",
    "the momentum sum rule for the anomalous dimensions in qcd states that @xmath36 order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "we can therefore write the generic perturbative expansions for both combinations of anomalous dimensions @xmath37 where the momentum sum rule condition gives @xmath38 for all @xmath39 . here , @xmath40 denotes one of the combinations , or it can be also the @xmath41 part of the @xmath42 . since the anomalous dimensions are suitable for the description of the collinear limit , which is @xmath43 , one can introduce the dual @xmath5 expansion which reads sym case , but the arguments can be generalized to running coupling . ]",
    "@xmath44 the corresponding anomalous dimension can be found from the nonlinear equation @xmath45 the lowest order condition reads then @xmath46 one can then relate the coefficients in both expansions to obtain the analog of the ( [ eq : omegaexp ] ) @xmath47 we see immediately that one encounters exactly the same pattern .",
    "when the lowest order vanishes @xmath48 , the existence of the @xmath5 expansion ( [ eq : gammaexp],[eq : gammaexp1 ] ) implies that @xmath49 .",
    "we see that the assumption about the @xmath5 expansion is consistent , because we know that all the higher order coefficients have to vanish , due to the momentum sum rule .    therefore , strictly following this logic , we are led to the conclusion that , the validity of the @xmath6 expansion for the kernel eigenvalue in the case of the van- ishing lowest order imposes strong constraint that the higher orders should automatically vanish too .",
    "this would imply that the odderon intercept is equal to unity in each order of the perturbation theory .",
    "in fact the vanishing of the odderon solution eigenvalue is most probably also related to the very same momentum sum rule constraint .",
    "as we know , in the infinite coupling limit the pomeron trajectory coincides with the graviton in @xmath50 for the case of the @xmath51 sym .",
    "this is manifested by the fact that the intercept becomes 2 in this limit , or @xmath52 correspondingly . as was demonstrated in @xcite this",
    "is also related to the momentum sum rule condition . for the odderon case",
    "it seems though that the conformal spin @xmath2 and @xmath6 are shifted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 correspondingly within the same eigenvalue function as the pomeron . unlike the pomeron case",
    "though , the intercept seems to stay equal to 1 for all values of the coupling .",
    "considering the arguments above , we are led to the conjecture that the bfkl equation also satisfies the momentum sum rule in analogy with the anomalous dimensions .",
    "the momentum sum rule for the bfkl is however valid for the transverse components of the momenta , whereas the momentum sum rule for the anomalous dimensions is valid for the longitudinal parts of the momenta .    for the case of the anomalous dimensions we have that @xmath55 which is of course equivalent to the first equation in ( [ eq : gammomentum ] ) .",
    "for the bfkl equation we should have the analogous condition which can be represented as @xmath56    the physical interpretation of this statement is quite clear . in the case of the collinear approximation ,",
    "the standard integrated parton densities satisfy the longitudinal momentum sum rule .",
    "the sum over the longitudinal momenta in the parton densities is constant , independent of the @xmath57 evolution .",
    "the dglap evolution equations can only redistribute the longitudinal momenta but can not change the longitudinal momentum sum rule constraint . in the bfkl case the evolution is in @xmath0 and the dynamics in the transverse momenta",
    "is non - trivial .",
    "the transverse momenta can be redistributed in the bfkl evolution but the overall sum is unchanged which can be expressed in the following condition @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the @xmath11 unintegrated gluon density .",
    "the hypothesis of @xmath6 expansion and the bfkl momentum sum rule can be tested by looking into the explicit result for the nllx eigenvalue at @xmath3 which was calculated in @xcite and recently in @xcite .",
    "we note , that the eigenvalue obtained there is for the case of the pomeron and the explicit verification for the case of the odderon still needs to be performed .",

    "as an example of the application of the @xmath6 expansion we will investigate what happens to the kernel eigenvalue and the intercept in the case when we include the shifts of the collinear poles in the kernel eigenvalue for @xmath3 case .",
    "the shifts originate from the kinematical constraint @xcite and are an important ingredient of the resummation procedure at small x. we will call this case the odderon with the kinematical constraints .",

    "the third order in @xmath35 can be obtained via next iteration and is equal @xmath87 clearly at each order of @xmath8 the solution to the intercept is again zero , since in ( [ eq : first ] ) and ( [ eq : second ] ) all the coefficients are proportional to @xmath88 which vanishes when @xmath4 . on the other hand the diffusion coefficient receives non - trivial correction due to the shifts .",
