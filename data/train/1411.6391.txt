    "wigner introduced random matrix theory ( rmt ) in physics in 1955 primarily to understand statistical properties of neutron resonances in heavy nuclei @xcite . depending on the global symmetry properties of the hamiltonian of a quantum system , namely rotational symmetry and time - reversal symmetry , we have dyson s tripartite classification of random matrices giving the classical random matrix ensembles , the gaussian orthogonal ( goe ) , unitary ( gue ) and symplectic ( gse ) ensembles . in the last three decades",
    ", rmt has found applications not only in all branches of quantum physics but also in many other disciplines such as econophysics , wireless communication , information theory , multivariate statistics , number theory , neural and biological networks and so on @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of isolated finite many - particle quantum systems , classical random matrix ensembles are too unspecific to account for important features of the physical system at hand .",
    "one refinement which retains the basic stochastic approach but allows for such features consists in the use of embedded random matrix ensembles .",
    "finite quantum systems such as nuclei , atoms , quantum dots , small metallic grains , interacting spin systems modeling quantum computing core and ultra - cold atoms , share one common property - their constituents predominantly interact via two - particle interactions .",
    "therefore , it is more appropriate to represent an isolated finite interacting quantum system , say with @xmath0 particles ( fermions or bosons ) in @xmath1 single particle ( sp ) states by random matrix models generated by random @xmath2-body ( note that @xmath5 and most often we have @xmath6 ) interactions and propagate the information in the interaction to many particle spaces .",
    "then we have random matrix ensembles in @xmath0-particle spaces - these ensembles are defined by representing the @xmath2-particle hamiltonian ( @xmath7 ) by goe / gue / gse and then the @xmath0 particle @xmath7 matrix is generated by the @xmath0-particle hilbert space geometry .",
    "the key element here is the recognition that there is a lie algebra that transports the information in the two - particle spaces to many - particle spaces . as a goe / gue / gse random matrix ensemble in two - particle spaces",
    "is embedded in the @xmath0-particle @xmath7 matrix , these ensembles are more generically called embedded ensembles ( ee ) .",
    "embedded ensembles are proved to be rich in their content and wide in their scope .",
    "a book giving detailed discussion of the various properties and applications of a wide variety of embedded matrix ensembles is now available @xcite .",
    "significantly , the study of embedded random matrix ensembles is still developing .",
    "partly this is due to the fact that mathematical tractability of these ensembles is still a problem and this is the topic of the present paper .",
    "a general formulation for deriving analytical results is to use the wigner - racah algebra of the embedding lie algebra @xcite .",
    "the focus in the present paper is on transition strengths .",
    "note that transition strengths probe the structure of the eigenfunctions of a quantum many - body system .    given a transition operator @xmath8 acting on the",
    "@xmath0 particle eigenstates @xmath9 of @xmath7 will give transition matrix elements @xmath10 and the corresponding transition strength density ( this will take into account degeneracies in the eigenvalues ) is , i_(e_i , e_f ) = i(e_f)|e_f e_i|^2i(e_i ) .",

    "we will apply group theoretical methods and derive for the first time some exact formulas for the lower order moments of the transition strength densities @xmath17 .",
    "using these , the general form of transition strength densities is deduced .",

    "in addition , a transition operator may preserve particle number and other quantum numbers or it may change them . off all these various situations , here we have considered three different systems : ( i ) a system of @xmath0 spinless fermions and a transition operator that preserves the particle number ; ( ii ) a transition operator that removes say @xmath19 number of particles from the @xmath0 fermion system ; ( iii ) a system with two types of spinless fermions with the transition operator changing @xmath19 number of particles of one type to @xmath19 number of other particles as in nuclear beta and double beta decay . in all these we will restrict to egue .",
