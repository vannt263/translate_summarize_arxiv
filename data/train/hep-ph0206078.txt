    "we consider the see - saw scenario , i.e.  the standard model ( sm ) or mssm extended by 3 heavy neutrinos that are singlets under the sm gauge groups and have large explicit ( majorana ) masses with a non - degenerate spectrum . due to this non - degeneracy",
    ", one has to use several effective theories , with the singlets partly integrated out , when studying the evolution of the effective mass matrix of the light neutrinos @xcite .",
    "below the lowest mass threshold , the neutrino mass matrix is given by the effective dimension 5 neutrino mass operator in the sm or mssm .",
    "the relevant rge s were derived in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we assume bimaximal mixing at the gut scale with vanishing cp phases and positive mass eigenvalues . we calculate the rg running numerically in order to obtain the mixing angles at low energy and to compare them with the experimentally favored values .",
    "we include the regions above and between the see - saw scales in our study , which have not been considered in most of the previous works .",
    "we find that the solar mixing angle changes considerably , while the evolution of the other angles is comparatively small , so that values compatible with the lma solution can be obtained .",
    "we present analytic approximations that help to understand this behavior and show that it is rather generic .",
    "at the gut scale , we assume bimaximal mixing in the lepton sector . we restrict ourselves to the case of positive mass eigenvalues and real parameters , so that there is no cp violation . in the basis where the charged lepton yukawa matrix is diagonal , up to phase conventions the general parametrization of the effective majorana mass matrix of the light neutrinos",

    "finally , it can be shown that the running of @xmath0 is always enhanced compared to that of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for inverted schemes .",
    "hence , we conclude that this is a generic effect .",
    "the considerable change of the solar mixing angle found in the previous sections raises the question whether the parameter region of the lma solution might be reached by rg evolution , if one starts with bimaximal mixing at high energy .",
    "we will investigate this possibility by further numerical calculations in the following . to reduce the parameter space for the numerical analysis , we choose a specific neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath26 at the gut scale .",

    "moreover , we fix the gut scale values of @xmath13 and @xmath11 by the requirement that the solar and atmospheric mass squared differences obtained at the ew scale after the rg evolution be compatible with the allowed experimental regions .",

    "the parameter @xmath64 controls the hierarchy of the entries in @xmath26 and thus the degeneracy of the see - saw scales , while @xmath65 determines the mass of the lightest neutrino .",
    "the dependence of physical quantities on @xmath64 and @xmath65 is shown in figure [ fig : parameters ] .",
    "the effect of changing the scale @xmath63 of the neutrino yukawa coupling will be discussed in section [ sec : smallx ] .",
    "as mentioned above , we work in the basis where the yukawa matrix of the charged leptons is diagonal .",
    "the parameter space regions in which the rg evolution produces low - energy values compatible with the lma solution are shown in figure [ fig : pscans ] for the sm and the mssm ( @xmath66 ) with a normal mass hierarchy .",
    "we find that for the form of @xmath26 under consideration , hierarchical and degenerate neutrino mass schemes as well as degenerate and non - degenerate see - saw scales are possible . for inverted neutrino mass spectra , allowed",
    "parameter space regions exist as well .",
    "we would like to stress that the shape of the allowed parameter space regions strongly depends on the choice of the initial value of @xmath26 at the gut scale .",
    "one also has to ensure that the sign of @xmath67 is positive , as the lma solution requires this if the convention is used that the solar mixing angle is smaller than @xmath68 .",
    "with bimaximal mixing at the gut scale , the sign of @xmath67 is not defined by the initial conditions . using the analytic approximation of section [ sec : analyticapproximation ] , the sign just below the gut scale can be calculated .",
    "we find @xmath69 for @xmath70 and vice versa .",
    "however , in order to predict the sign of @xmath71 at low energy , the numerical rg evolution has to be used .",
    "this excludes some of the possible choices for the neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath26 at the gut scale .",
    "for example , among the possibilities with diagonal @xmath26 it excludes @xmath72 .      for small values of @xmath63 , the contribution from @xmath26 to the evolution of the mixing angles above the largest see - saw scale is suppressed by a factor of @xmath73 .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution to the lma solution is still possible , as can be seen from the example in figure [ fig : runningforsmallx ] . here",
    "the large change of @xmath0 also seems to be generic but takes place between the see - saw scales , which shows the importance of carefully studying the rg behavior in these intermediate regions @xcite .",
    "note that in this case the analytic approximation of section [ sec : analyticapprox ] can not be applied , since it is only valid at the gut scale .",
    "@xmath23{typicalmaevolutionsmxletter.eps}}}$ ]      an example for the running of the mixing angles to the lma solution with a negative cp parity for the state with mass @xmath74 is shown in figure [ fig : runningwithmajparities ] .",
    "for this we have chosen a different diagonal structure for @xmath26 , @xmath75 at the gut scale . here , the evolution to the lma solution is possible due to running between the see - saw scales .",
    "a more detailed study of the effect of cp phases will be given in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "@xmath23{typicalmaevolutionsmcp.eps}}}$ ]    the large rg effects in this case seem surprising at first sight , since previous studies , e.g.  @xcite , found that opposite cp parities for @xmath60 and @xmath74 prevent a sizable change of the solar mixing angle by rg evolution .",
    "however , these works did not consider the energy region between the see - saw scales , where the largest change occurs in our example .",
    "this fact explains the apparent discrepancy .",
    "the mixing angles @xmath1 and @xmath2 are affected by the rg evolution as well , i.e.  they do not stay at their initial values @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "however , lower bounds on their changes can not be given unless a specific model is chosen .",
    "as one can see from the previous examples , the changes can be tiny .",
    "for instance , the evolution of figure [ fig:3 ] gives @xmath78 , which corresponds to @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "on the other hand , other choices of @xmath26 at the gut scale produce @xmath81 and @xmath82 that come close to the experimental bounds .",
    "this can make it possible to discriminate between models with different initial values @xmath83 .",
    "we have shown that in see - saw scenarios the experimentally favored neutrino mass parameters with the lma solution of the solar neutrino problem can be obtained in a rather generic way from bimaximal mixing at the gut scale by renormalization group running .",
    "we have concentrated on the case of vanishing cp phases , which implies positive mass eigenvalues . in an example where the mass eigenstates corresponding to the solar mass squared difference have opposite cp parity , we have demonstrated that an evolution towards the lma solution is possible in this case as well .",
    "the general case of arbitrary cp phases is beyond the scope of this letter and will be studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the mixing angles evolved down to the electroweak scale show a strong dependence on the mass scale of the lightest neutrino , on the degeneracy of the see - saw scales , and on the form of the neutrino yukawa coupling .",
    "a generic feature of the renormalization group evolution is that the solar mixing angle @xmath0 evolves towards sizably smaller values , whereas the change of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is comparatively small . in the sm and mssm",
    ", we find extensive regions in parameter space which are compatible with the lma solution for normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies and for large and small absolute scales of the neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "thus , rg running may provide a natural explanation for the observed deviation of the lma mixing angles from bimaximality .",
