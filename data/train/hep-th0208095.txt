    "it has recently been demonstrated that certain four dimensional gauge theories can reproduce the physics of higher dimensional gauge theories , typically up to some energy scale @xcite .",
    "the four dimensional theory is referred to as the `` deconstructed , '' or `` latticized , '' theory .",
    "gauge theories in more than four dimensions are typically not renormalizable , so the deconstructed theory provides an ultraviolet completion for the higher dimensional theory .",
    "the basic idea is to begin with a four dimensional action which , after certain elementary or composite fields get vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , is the action for the higher dimensional theory latticized in all but four dimensions , plus corrections which become small if the lattice spacing is relatively small .",
    "the lattice spacing can generally not be taken to zero in a controlled way because this requires the infinite coupling limit of the gauge theory .",
    "deconstruction of extra dimensions has proved useful in model building @xcite , and often the number of lattice sites can be taken as small as two while maintaining the relevant features of the extra dimensions .",
    "deconstruction of supersymmetric ( susy ) models is especially interesting @xcite .",
    "the deconstructed susy theory typically has less supersymmetry at high energies than at the low energies for which it describes the higher dimensional model .",
    "this unusual behavior is due to an accidental symmetry on the chosen branch of moduli space of the theory , and it must be checked that there are no radiative or nonperturbative corrections which would violate the enhancement of susy . in the case where the 5d susy gauge theory with 8 supercharges is deconstructed to a theory with @xmath4=1 susy in 4d ( 4 supercharges ) @xcite , stability of the spectrum and other holomorphic data follows from a non - anomalous u(1)@xmath5 symmetry which is preserved , or alternatively by the @xmath4=1 nonrenormalization theorem which prevents the generation of @xmath4=2 susy breaking terms in the superpotential . here we will study a six dimensional theory with 16 supercharges , deconstructed to a theory with 8 supercharges . in this case",
    "we will explicitly understand the stability of susy enhancement from the seiberg - witten description of the theory .",
    "this model was studied in @xcite , and we will generalize the model to the case with arbitrary theta vacuum in the deconstructed theory . by varying the theta vacuum we deconstruct the 6d theory with ( 0,2 ) susy compactified on a torus with arbitrary complex structure .",

    "these limits imply that the theory is better described within m - theory compactified on a circle @xmath50 which is held fixed in the deconstruction limit .",
    "when lifted to m - theory the brane configuration is generically described by a single m5-brane wrapped on the seiberg - witten curve .",

    "the 11d planck length @xmath54 is small , and the theory which lives on this brane configuration is the 6d ( 0,2 ) theory wrapped on a torus up to energies which probe the ns5-branes .",
    "we will discuss the relevant energy scales in more detail later . at energies smaller than the inverse size of the torus ,",
    "the theory is simply 4d @xmath4=4 yang - mills theory .",
    "this demonstration was another approach to the same m5-brane configuration described in @xcite .",
    "but , as we will see by studying the seiberg - witten curve for this theory , the choice of theta vacuum of the deconstructed theory is reflected in the complex structure of the manifold on which the m5-brane is wrapped .",
    "in this section we will demonstrate the factorization of the seiberg - witten curve on the reduced coulomb branch , and thus the enhancement of supersymmetry . to begin we will avoid the additional complications which arise from putting the @xmath31 direction on a circle , and first demonstrate in more detail the decoupling of the coulomb and higgs branches in the seiberg - witten curve for the following @xmath4=2 theory with hypermultiplet @xmath55 : @xmath56{6.5pt}{0.4pt}}\\rule[6.5pt]{0.4pt}{0.4pt}\\hskip-0.4pt\\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt } } } } & \\overline{{\\raisebox{-.5pt}{{\\hbox{\\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}\\hskip-0.4pt\\rule{6.5pt}{0.4pt}\\hskip-6.5pt\\rule[6.5pt]{6.5pt}{0.4pt}}\\rule[6.5pt]{0.4pt}{0.4pt}\\hskip-0.4pt\\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt } } } } } \\end{array}\\ ] ] recall that the hypermultiplet is vectorlike , so this theory is anomaly free .",
    "it is described by the brane configuration shown in figure  [ fig : branes]b .",
    "note that this theory differs from that studied in @xcite in that the latter had a vanishing superpotential , whereas the @xmath4=2 theory studied here has superpotential , @xmath57 where @xmath55 and @xmath58 are the two @xmath4=1 chiral multiplets in the bifundamental hypermultiplet , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the adjoint chiral multiplets of the two su@xmath9 gauge groups .",
    "greek and roman indices run from @xmath61 to @xmath21 and refer to the two gauge group factors . the lagrange multipliers @xmath62 and @xmath63 enforce the tracelessness of the adjoint fields . although the superpotential was absent in @xcite , their analysis of the @xmath64-flatness constraints on @xmath55 and @xmath58 is unchanged as long as the adjoints @xmath59 and @xmath60 do not get vevs .",
    "it was found there that the general solution to the @xmath64-flatness constraints was that @xmath55 and @xmath58 take the form , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a diagonal su@xmath9 matrix .",
    "the @xmath67-flatness constraints can be read off of the superpotential ( [ eq : w ] ) , namely @xmath68 and two similar equations of motion with respect to @xmath60 and @xmath55 .",
    "note that generically the bifundamentals @xmath55 and @xmath58 can not get vevs if the adjoints @xmath59 and @xmath60 do have vevs , but if @xmath59 and @xmath60 have equal nonvanishing vevs in the cartan subalgebra of the corresponding su@xmath9 , then @xmath55 and @xmath58 can get vevs proportional to the identity .",
    "in particular , we can choose @xmath69 .",
    "this is the reduced coulomb branch discussed earlier .",
    "we can easily recover this behavior from the seiberg - witten curve for this theory .",
    "the seiberg - witten curve and one - form determine the holomorphic gauge coupling function and khler potential on the coulomb branch as a function of the coulomb branch moduli of the theory , namely the vevs of gauge invariant operators @xcite , @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "but we will restrict the vevs to all be equal so that we intersect the higgs branch , in which case there are only @xmath72 independent moduli in the curve , as opposed to @xmath73 . if we define the complex parameters @xmath41 and @xmath74 ( which is holomorphic because @xmath75 ) , then witten argued that the m5-brane is described by the curve @xcite , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a polynomial of degree @xmath21 in @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the dynamical scale of su@xmath80 . at constant @xmath81 , ( [ eq : sw2 ] )",
    "has @xmath21 roots for @xmath78 , which correspond to the positions of the @xmath21 d4-branes at that @xmath81 . at constant @xmath78 , ( [ eq : sw2 ] )",
    "has @xmath82 roots for @xmath81 , which correspond to the positions of the ns5-branes at that @xmath78 .",
    "if we write , @xmath83 then the @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ; @xmath86 ) represent the positions of the @xmath21 d4-branes between the @xmath87th and @xmath88th ns5-branes . in terms of the su@xmath89su@xmath9 gauge theory that lives on the branes , for @xmath85 , the @xmath84 are the vevs of the adjoint in the @xmath87th su@xmath9 factor ( up to instanton corrections)@xcite .",
    "the difference in the average of the @xmath84 on the two sides of an ns5-brane is the bare mass of the corresponding bifundamental hypermultiplet , which we take to be zero , @xmath90 the adjoint vevs are in the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group , but are not gauge invariant .",
    "they transform under the weyl group ( which preserves the cartan subalgebra ) , which permutes the vevs @xmath84 for fixed @xmath87 . instead , the curve should be written in terms of the gauge invariant moduli , which are in general shifted from their classical values by instanton effects .",
    "the seiberg - witten curve can then be written @xcite , @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the same function of @xmath78 , the coulomb branch moduli @xmath94 defined in ( [ eq : moduli1 ] ) and ( [ eq : moduli2 ] ) , and the dynamical scale of the corresponding su@xmath80 group factor .",
    "contains a constant term proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "this represents a shift in the maximal moduli @xmath96 and @xmath97 from their classical values .",
    "we have ignored a numerical constant in the definition of the dynamical scale . for more on these subtleties ,",
    "see for example @xcite . ]",
    "equating the vevs of the two adjoint scalars amounts to setting @xmath98 . in that case ,",
    "the curve ( [ eq : sw2a ] ) factorizes as , @xmath99 if all moduli and dynamical scales are the same for each gauge group factor su@xmath80 , this amounts to enforcing a reflection symmetry about the middle ns5-brane .",
    "if we fix @xmath100 , the symmetry @xmath101 becomes @xmath102 .",
    "if we then equate the dynamical scales @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and fix the moduli of both gauge groups to be equal , then the factorization of the curve immediately follows from the @xmath102 symmetry .",
    "physically , the factorization corresponds to the fact that the hypermultiplet @xmath55 can get a vev from such a point in moduli space , where the coulomb and higgs branches intersect , and the higgs and coulomb branches decouple @xcite . in the m - theory picture",
    "giving a vev to @xmath55 corresponds to removing the middle brane , which is at @xmath105 as we have written the curve , in the @xmath106 directions . by rescaling the curve by @xmath107 , the dynamics along the reduced coulomb branch",
    "is given by the factor multiplying @xmath108 , which we recognize to be simply the seiberg - witten curve for the diagonal su@xmath13 gauge theory , with dynamical scale @xmath109 .",
    "that is , the seiberg - witten curve describes the unbroken u(1)@xmath24 gauge theory on the reduced coulomb branch . giving a vev to the hypermultiplet @xmath55 corresponds to the removal of the middle brane in the @xmath106 directions , but as mentioned earlier that dynamics is decoupled from the dynamics described by the seiberg - witten curve at low energies .",
    "we now see explicitly from the brane construction that the enhancement of susy along the reduced coulomb or higgs branch is stable to radiative and nonperturbative corrections .",
    "the d4-branes break half of the 32 supersymmetries of the type iia string theory , and the ns5-branes break another half . if the ns5-branes are removed , then the remaining theory at energies below those which probe the ns5-branes is that of the d4-branes on the circle , which has twice as much susy .",
    "in essence , the theory has factorized into the theory on the parallel ns5-branes with 16 supercharges , and the theory on the d4-branes with a different 16 supercharges .",
    "the decoupling is confirmed by the factorization of the seiberg - witten curve .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we need to take the number of gauge group factors large in order to be able to probe the size of the torus because otherwise the spectrum differs from the expected kk spectrum at low energies , and the deconstructed theory can not correspond to a six dimensional theory on a torus",
    ". we can understand this from the string theory construction as well by considering the relevant energy scales .",
    "the type iia brane configuration is useful in understanding the gauge theory on that brane configuration at energies less than @xmath35 .",
    "the ( 0,2 ) theory is the theory on a stack of m5-branes with vanishing 11d planck scale , @xmath110 , so we take @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore , the theory that lives on the wrapped m5-branes is only the ( 0,2 ) theory up to scales where they probe the m5-branes that were removed from the torus . at energies much smaller than the inverse sizes of the torus ,",
    "the ( 0,2 ) theory becomes the 4d @xmath4=4 theory .",
    "we want to arrange the parameters of the theory so that we can probe somewhat higher energies , on the scale of the inverse sizes of the torus , without also probing the ns5-branes .",
    "strings which stretch from a d4 brane to an ns5 brane and back carry energy of order @xmath112 , corresponding to the fact that at that energy the gauge theory probes the individual gauge group factors and hypermultiplets @xmath7 .",
    "the size of the torus is determined by the low lying `` electric '' spectrum of the gauge theory , which corresponds to the kk modes around the @xmath31 circle .",
    "this fixes @xmath113 , so we must have @xmath0 large in order for the scale of low lying kk modes to be much smaller than the bifundamental hypermultiplet scale @xmath112 .",
    "notice that the size of the torus is related to the positions of the ns5-branes .",
    "@xmath27 will be related to @xmath32 by identifying the low energy gauge coupling in terms of @xmath114 via the m5-brane brane construction .",
    "alternatively , we can identify @xmath27 via the magnetic spectrum , as in @xcite , which is interpreted as the kk modes around the other cycle of the torus . for nonvanishing theta parameter in the low energy su@xmath13 gauge group , the low lying states in the large @xmath0 limit have masses , @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the electric and magnetic quantum numbers of the bps ( in the sense of the theory with sixteen supercharges ) dyon , respectively , and correspond to the kk numbers around the two one - cycles of the torus .",
    "equation ( [ eq : bps ] ) also determines the complex structure of the torus , @xmath118 , in terms of the gauge theory parameters .",
    "note that the bifundamental vev @xmath25 sets the overall scale for the flat metric on the torus , but does not appear in the period @xmath119 .",
    "this is once again a reflection of the product structure of the higgs and coulomb branches where they intersect .",
    "the first equality in ( [ eq : bps ] ) is the holomorphic extension of the spectrum found in @xcite , where @xmath120 is the holomorphic vev .",
    "the second equality in ( [ eq : bps ] ) follows immediately from the m - theory construction as we will now see .",
    "to identify the complex structure of the torus we will closely follow witten @xcite .",
    "the m - theory circle in the @xmath52 direction has radius @xmath27 and the circle in the @xmath31 direction has radius @xmath32 .",
    "the bare gauge coupling of the @xmath87th gauge group su@xmath80 is given by the difference in the @xmath121 positions of the @xmath87th and @xmath88th ns5-branes @xcite , @xmath122 the bare coupling of the diagonal gauge group is given by , @xmath123 the theta parameter of the su@xmath80 gauge group factor is given by the difference in the @xmath52 positions of the @xmath87th and @xmath88th ns5-branes @xcite , @xmath124 by `` going around the circle '' in the @xmath31 direction , namely by summing ( [ eq : theta ] ) over @xmath125 , we would find@xmath126 by varying @xmath127 , the theta parameters in the gauge theory can be chosen arbitrarily , as now @xmath128 .",
    "the period of the torus @xmath129 is identified with the holomorphic gauge coupling of the diagonal su@xmath13 gauge theory on the higgs branch , @xmath130 .",
    "thus , by varying @xmath114 and @xmath127 , or equivalently by varying the gauge couplings and theta parameters of the deconstructed theory , the complex structure of the torus on which the ( 0,2 ) theory is compactified can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "let us now discuss the factorization of the seiberg - witten curve on the intersection of the higgs and coulomb branches for the full deconstructed theory .",
    "a classical analysis similar to that done in section  [ sec : factorization ] indicates that there is a reduced coulomb branch in this theory along which the seiberg - witten curve should factorize .",
    "we write the seiberg - witten curve as in @xcite : @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 parametrize the torus on which the m5-brane lives , which is specified by an elliptic curve of the form , @xmath134 for some complex constants @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "these constants , together with the unique nonsingular holomorphic differential @xmath137 and a choice of cycles , determine the complex structure of the torus . to be precise , there is a basis of cycles @xmath138 and @xmath139 on the torus with unit intersection from which the period of the torus can be calculated as @xmath140 the period @xmath119 is to be identified with the gauge coupling and @xmath127 parameter of the diagonal su@xmath13 gauge group via @xmath141 .",
    "the constants @xmath142 in ( [ eq : torus ] ) and the cycles @xmath143 are chosen to give the correct period @xmath119 on the moduli space of vacua .",
    "there is also a flat metric on the torus which specifies its size .    for generic adjoint vevs",
    ", there are @xmath21 roots for @xmath78 , which describe the positions of the d4-branes as before .",
    "the functions @xmath144 are generically meromorphic functions on the torus which have simple poles . at the pole",
    "there would be a singularity in at least one of the roots of @xmath78 which looks near the singularity like , @xmath145 where @xmath146 is a good local coordinate on the torus near the singularity .",
    "this would describe the smooth connection of the d4-brane at @xmath147 to the ns5-brane at @xmath148 .",
    "but at points in the moduli space where the higgs and coulomb branches meet , the curve factorizes .",
    "this happens when the @xmath144 are constants .",
    "the interpretation of this is as follows .",
    "if we assume that @xmath149 then in the neighborhood of an ns5-brane the seiberg - witten curve is well described by the coordinates @xmath78 and @xmath150 with the @xmath31 position of the ns5-brane set to 0 , say .",
    "( alternatively we can just focus on an appropriate neighborhood of the ns5 brane for which @xmath151 , and remove the restriction on @xmath114 . )",
    "when the higgs and coulomb branches intersect there is a symmetry corresponding to reflections about the ns5-brane , which as we saw earlier implies that the curve should factorize near the ns5-branes .",
    "this implies that locally the @xmath144 in ( [ eq : swcircle ] ) are constants , which by holomorphy implies they are constants over the torus . then , using the s - duality which takes @xmath152 and @xmath153 we can relax the restriction @xmath149 , so that the @xmath144 are generically constants on the intersection of the higgs and coulomb branches .    in order to completely specify the brane configuration in the case in which it factorizes , the curve ( [ eq : swcircle ] )",
    "should instead be written , @xmath154 where now the @xmath155 are all equal up to overall numerical constants .",
    "all of the @xmath156 of ( [ eq : swcircle ] ) are then constants .",
    "the curve factorizes as , @xmath157 where @xmath158 are the positions of the d4-branes , and the zeroes of @xmath159 specify the positions of the ns5-branes .",
    "the singular intersections of the d4-branes and ns5-branes are similar to ( [ eq : intersect ] ) with @xmath160 .",
    "having understood how the m - theory 5-brane configuration contains information about the reduced coulomb branch that we are interested in , we can now easily understand the emergence of the ( 0,2 ) theory from the deconstructed theory .",
    "when the vevs of all the adjoints are equal , the seiberg - witten curve describing the brane configuration factorizes into a product of terms reflecting the positions of the flat ns5-branes and the positions of the d4-branes which wrap the @xmath31 direction . when the ns5-branes are removed symmetrically around the torus , the seiberg - witten curve describes the remaining d4-branes , which are really m5-branes wrapped on the @xmath31@xmath52 torus .",
    "if we also take the 11d planck scale @xmath161 to zero , then up to the presence of the additional ns5-branes this is precisely the ( 0,2)@xmath17 theory on a torus whose complex structure we have identified above . at very low energies",
    "the theory on the d4-branes is the 4d @xmath4=4 su@xmath9 gauge theory , the dynamics of which is not corrected by the presence of the ns5-branes ( as a result of the product structure of the higgs and coulomb branches ) . at higher energies but below the scale @xmath112 which probes the positions of the ns5-branes , the spectrum mimics the kk spectrum expected of the ( 0,2)@xmath17 theory on a torus with the same complex structure as that determined by the seiberg - witten curve .",
    "this provides additional evidence that the deconstructed theory does indeed mimic the ( 0,2 ) theory at scales which probe the size of the torus on which the ( 0,2 ) theory is compactified .",
