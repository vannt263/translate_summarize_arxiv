    "it is an exciting possibility that dark matter has a supersymmetric origin .",
    "various species can have the properties of dark matter depending on the supersymmetry breaking mechanism and further particulars of the model , with the neutralino and gravitino being the most prominent candidates .    in classes of models like anomaly @xcite and mirage @xcite mediation , the gravitino is heavier than the other sparticles and",
    "thus can not constitute dark matter . on the other hand , in gauge @xcite and gaugino @xcite mediation , the gravitino is light and represents a good candidate for dark matter @xcite,@xcite . in gravity mediation",
    "@xcite , the situation is more model - dependent and both relatively heavy and light gravitinos are possible . in this work ,",
    "we study the circumstances under which the gravitino is the lsp in gravity mediation . if we further require r- or matter parity @xcite , which can descend from string theory @xcite , the gravitino is stable and can constitute dark matter .",
    "phenomenology of the gravitino lsp has been an active research subject @xcite@xcite , while in this paper we focus on its supergravity side and identify relevant constraints on fundamental supergravity quantities .",
    "let us review relevant features of the supergravity formalism , following @xcite ( and the original work @xcite ) .",
    "the supergravity scalar potential is given ( in planck units ) by @xmath7 here the subscript @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) denotes differentiation with respect to the @xmath10-th ( @xmath10-th complex conjugate ) scalar field .",
    "@xmath11 is a function of the khler potential @xmath0 and the superpotential @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the susy breaking @xmath14-terms are @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the inverse of @xmath17 .",
    "the gravitino mass is given by @xmath18 another quantity we need is the khler metric @xmath19 for the observable fields @xmath20 .",
    "it is found by expanding the khler potential around @xmath21 : @xmath22 then the soft susy breaking terms are given by @xcite @xmath23\\;,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 are the gauge kinetic functions , @xmath25 @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the superpotential yukawa couplings .",
    "vanishing of the vacuum energy requires @xmath28 at the minimum of the scalar potential .",
    "thus , the magnitude of the @xmath14-terms depends on the khler metric of the susy breaking fields @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath14-terms and , consequently , the soft masses can be much larger than the gravitino mass provided the khler metric is sufficiently small .",
    "let us consider the case of a single dominant susy breaking field @xmath29 .",
    "omitting for simplicity complex phases , we have @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "let us further assume universal gauge kinetic functions and khler metrics for the matter fields .",
    "then the soft terms simplify to @xmath32~ m_{3/2}^2 ~ , \\nonumber\\\\ a_0 & = & \\sqrt{3\\over   k''}~ \\biggl [ k ' -3 { \\tilde k ' \\over \\tilde k }    \\biggr]~m_{3/2}~ , \\label{softmassessinglefield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath29 and a double prime differentiation with respect to @xmath29 and @xmath33 . we have assumed that the yukawa couplings are independent of @xmath29 , which allows us to avoid strong constraints from electric dipole moments @xcite .",
    "this case corresponds to the cmssm .",
    "we see that the scalar and gaugino masses can be made arbitrarily large by decreasing @xmath34 .",
    "this requires a non - negligible @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "if this quantity vanishes at the gut scale , large scalar masses are induced by the renormalization group evolution down to the electroweak ( ew ) scale .",
    "since the gravitino mass does not run , we have @xmath37 and the gravitino is the lsp .",
    "the @xmath38-terms usually do not play any significant role unless they are much larger than the other soft parameters .",
    "let us quantify this effect . in the cmssm ,",
    "the lightest superparticle is either a neutralino ( mostly bino ) or a stau .",
    "unless @xmath39 is large , their masses can be approximated by @xcite,@xcite @xmath40 where we have neglected the ew contributions . for moderate @xmath41 ,",
    "the lightest neutralino is lighter than the staus .",
    "then the gravitino is the lsp for @xmath42 for small @xmath41 , the stau is lighter than the neutralino , so that a larger @xmath43 is required for a gravitino lsp .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ masses ] ) shows that the change in the lower bound will be rather small , so that eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) is still a good approximation .",
    "thus , the key parameter is the gaugino mass @xmath43 and as long as the scalar masses squared are non - negative , we obtain the gravitino lsp for @xmath44 where we have used @xmath45 .",
    "this bound does not involve the superpotential nor the khler metric for the observable fields and is therefore largely model - independent .    in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we illustrate these results with a numerical analysis in the cmssm .",
    "we have used softsusy @xcite to determine the low - energy superpartner spectrum .",
    "the figures display parameter space regions with the gravitino , neutralino and stau lsp .",
    "we have chosen @xmath46  gev to fix the overall mass scale for definiteness , while the qualitative features of the plots are independent of this .    at large @xmath39 , eq .",
    "( [ masses ] ) receives corrections mainly from the @xmath47 yukawa coupling so that the @xmath48 becomes the lsp at small @xmath41 .",
    "this is displayed in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . also , large @xmath38-terms further decrease the stau mass and can lead to tachyons , so that the @xmath48 lsp and the excluded regions are enlarged , cf.fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "gev and @xmath49.,title=\"fig : \" ]  gev and @xmath49.,title=\"fig : \" ]    , but with a large @xmath38-term . ]",
    "let us note that our parameter space is subject to further ( model - dependent ) phenomenological constraints .",
    "these depend on the overall mass scale , assumptions on the cosmological history , whether r - symmetry is exact or approximate and whether the gravitino constitutes all or just part of the observed dark matter . for instance , as the lep bound on the higgs mass requires @xmath50  gev , eq .",
    "( [ softmassessinglefield ] ) implies @xmath51  gev for @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for detailed studies",
    ", we refer an interested reader to refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) , we see that @xmath34 is not required to be very small . in fact , it is of the order of magnitude of typical @xmath34 expected in string theory .",
    "the usual moduli / dilaton khler potential is @xmath54 with @xmath55 so that @xmath56 just to have an idea of the numerics , take @xmath29 to be the dilaton of the heterotic string .",
    "then @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 at the minimum of the potential , as required by the observed values of the gauge couplings .",
    "we get @xmath60 , which falls just short of the bound ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that the dilaton - dominated susy breaking is not possible with the above khler potential and in realistic cases one has to include either non - perturbative corrections to the khler potential @xcite,@xcite or additional fields . in the former case ,",
    "one typically has @xmath61 at the minimum of the potential @xcite,@xcite , although the zero vacuum energy is not enforced .",
    "when @xmath29 is the modulus associated with the radius of the compact dimensions , one can trust the supergravity approximation for @xmath62 in which case @xmath63 can be arbitrarily small .",
    "in realistic cases , however , one has to include more than one field to have the correct gauge coupling , e.g. @xmath64 .",
    "otherwise , the gauge coupling becomes too small .",
    "one can also entertain the possibility that @xmath29 is a hidden matter - like field with the khler potential @xmath65 , which dominates susy breaking @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath66 can be very small due to large moduli , @xmath67 .",
    "however , the gauge kinetic function is then given predominantly by some other field , e.g.  the dilaton , so that @xmath68 . consequently , @xmath69 can be sufficiently small for the gravitino to be the lsp , yet @xmath70 would require careful engineering",
    ".    the above formulae can be generalized to the case of multiple susy breaking fields in a straightforward manner .",
    "let us illustrate with an example how the gravitino lsp can arise in string - motivated setups .",
    "consider two modulus - type fields @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath75 is the matter `` modular weight '' , which can be negative , positive or zero @xcite . for @xmath76 , locally stable vacua with zero ( or small ) vacuum energy are possible @xcite",
    "for instance , this is the case when @xmath77 are the overall modulus and the dilaton .",
    "finally , one can choose an appropriate superpotential such that the fields stabilize at @xmath78 in order to have the correct gauge couplings at the gut scale",
    ". `` mixed '' gauge kinetic functions of this type appear in string models with fluxes @xcite,@xcite .    requiring zero vacuum energy at the minimum of the scalar potential and neglecting complex phases , we can parametrize supersymmetry breaking by the goldstino angle @xmath79 : @xmath80 then the soft terms read @xmath81    ~m_{3/2 } ~ , \\nonumber\\\\ m_0 ^ 2 & = & \\biggl [ 1 +   { 3n \\over a     } ~\\cos^2\\theta   \\biggr]~ m_{3/2}^2 ~ , \\nonumber\\\\ a_0 & = & -\\sqrt{3}~ \\biggl [ \\sqrt{a } \\left(1 + { 3n \\over a     } \\right ) ~\\cos\\theta + \\sqrt{b } ~ \\sin\\theta     \\biggr]~m_{3/2}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a sufficiently large @xmath71 and @xmath82 , the gauginos are heavy so that @xmath83 and the gravitino is the lsp .",
    "note that the @xmath84 dependence cancels out in @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "taking as an example @xmath77 to be the overall modulus and the dilaton , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "then for @xmath89 , the gravitino lsp imposes the bound @xmath90 .",
    "note that the scalar masses are non - tachyonic at the gut scale for @xmath91 .",
    "let us finally note that the superpotential does not play a role in this discussion as long as it stabilizes the fields at the desired values with vanishing vacuum energy .",
    "this question can be analyzed locally , in terms of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite . as a result",
    ", the superpotential expansion coefficients @xmath94 , @xmath95 , have to satisfy certain ( model - dependent ) constraints .",
    "we have studied the conditions for the gravitino to be the lsp in models of gravity mediated susy breaking .",
    "this requirement constrains mainly the gaugino mass parameter at the gut scale while the other parameters play a minor role , as long as the scalar masses are non - tachyonic . for cmssm - type models at moderate @xmath39 ,",
    "the resulting constraint on the khler potential and the gauge kinetic function is approximately @xmath2 , where the derivatives are taken with respect to the dominant susy breaking field . for large @xmath39 and @xmath38-terms ,",
    "the above constraint gets modified at small values of the universal scalar mass @xmath41 .",
    "the results are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the condition @xmath2 can easily be satisfied in string - motivated set - ups and thus the gravitino lsp is a reasonable alternative to the neutralino lsp in gravity mediation . as it is hard to obtain an extremely small value of @xmath34 without finetuning , the gravitino mass is still expected to be of the same order of magnitude as the other soft masses .",
