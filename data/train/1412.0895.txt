    "experiments searching for neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath0 ) decay require an extremely low background level in the region of interest around a few mev .",
    "compton scattered @xmath1-particles , originating from radioactive decays in the proximity of the detectors , are an important background contribution at such energies .    in high - purity germanium ( hpge ) experiments ,",
    "these interactions are often identified and removed from the signal data set through pulse - shape analysis ( psa ) . in order to extract a half - life limit ,",
    "the signal recognition efficiency has to be known . usually , experimentally obtained pulse - shape libraries with signal - like events are used to obtain the signal recognition efficiency . however , these evaluation libraries can have energy - deposition topologies and event - location distributions different to those of the signal searched for .",
    "efficiencies obtained like this can be systematically different from the recognition efficiency for the real signal . furthermore , the evaluation libraries used to derive the recognition efficiencies often contain events of the wrong type , making a direct determination of the efficiencies impossible .",
    "this paper presents investigations of the reproducibility and systematic uncertainties of the efficiencies of pulse - shape discrimination ( psd ) using artificial neural networks ( anns ) with libraries of simulated pulses .",
    "the general idea of psd using anns is introduced and the sources of possible systematic effects are discussed . the simulations and the libraries used for the analysis are described as well as the anns and the procedures used to train them .",
    "the stability of the method against initial conditions and ann topologies is investigated .",
    "the focus is on the differences obtained in recognition efficiencies using different evaluation libraries and the associated systematic uncertainties .",
    "the detection principle of semiconductor detectors is based on the creation and detection of electron  hole pairs , i.e.  charge carriers , when radiation interacts with the detector material .",
    "charge - sensitive preamplifiers are commonly used to detect the drifting charge carriers in large volume hpge detectors .",
    "the time structure of an event , the pulse - shape , is defined by the mirror charge signal induced on the electrodes as a function of time .",
    "the pulse length is given by the time needed to fully collect the charges on the electrodes .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite for a detailed description of the pulse creation process .    for photons in the mev range ,",
    "the dominant interaction process is compton scattering .",
    "a photon with an energy of one mev has a mean free path of @xmath23 cm in germanium .",
    "thus , photon - induced events with energies of about 2mev are mostly composed of several energy deposits within a hpge detector , separated by a few centimeters .",
    "these background - like events are referred to as multi - site events ( mse ) .",
    "in contrast , electrons with the same energy have a range of the order of millimeters and deposit their kinetic energy `` locally '' .",
    "signal - like events of this kind are referred to as single - site events ( sse ) .",
    "note that in reality there also exists `` signal - like '' background , i.e.  background events that have an indistinguishable event topology , such as the irreducible background from @xmath3 decay .",
    "the two electrons emitted in 0@xmath4 decay result predominantly in sses . due to bremsstrahlung ,",
    "a fraction of a few % of the 0@xmath4-decay events become mses  @xcite .",
    "events identified as mse in the energy region of interest are rejected as background .",
    "methods to distinguish between sses and mses in hpge detectors using anns were developed previously  @xcite . in most previous works , events from double escape peaks ( dep ) and full energy peaks ( fep ) were used to create training libraries of signal - like and background - like events , respectively .",
    "these were obtained from calibration data for which sources such as @xmath5th or @xmath6co were used . the ann efficiencies to correctly identify events",
    "are also typically extracted using evaluation libraries from calibration measurements .",
    "the efficiencies of psd methods are not necessarily homogeneous throughout the detector volume . for a realistic evaluation",
    ", the spatial distribution of the events in a given test library has to be taken into account .",
    "especially , dep events will exhibit a non - uniformity in event location distribution due to the topology of the events .",
    "if pair production occurs in a coaxial hpge at high radii , @xmath7 , and height , @xmath8 , i.e.  close to the extreme boundaries , the probability for the two 511kev @xmath1-particles to escape is the highest . hence , libraries of dep events have a higher event location density in these parts of the detector ( see section  [ sec : libraries ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : psa : event_distr ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "signal events due to @xmath0 decay ( but also `` signal - like '' background events due to @xmath3 decay ) are expected to be homogeneously distributed . using a library with an event location distribution different from the one expected for",
    "the signal can lead to systematic biases .",
    "the main scope of this work is to address this issue and estimate the uncertainties on the sse recognition efficiency evaluation arising from the use of different training and evaluation sets .",
    "in order to quantify the uncertainties on the ann event topology recognition efficiencies , simulations are used .",
    "the signal ( background ) recognition efficiency @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) of any psd method is defined as the probability that the method correctly identifies an sse ( mse ) from an event - library containing only sses ( mses ) .",
    "realistic sse and mse pulse - shape libraries always contain events of both classes .",
    "hence , the ann method applied to a library of predominantly sse or mse pulses will result in a survival probability @xmath11 or rejection probability @xmath12 , defined as the fraction of pulses in the library that are classified as sse or mse , respectively : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the fraction of sses and mses in the sse - library , respectively , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the fraction of mses and sses in the mse - library , respectively . using simulated pulses idealized libraries with @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be created .",
    "these libraries can be used to determine @xmath9 and @xmath10 directly , as for this case @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( see equ .",

    "are compared to those obtained from libraries with a homogeneous event - location distribution .",
    "the stability of the method is verified by training and evaluating a set of anns with different initial weights of the ann synapses and with training libraries of different sizes .",
    "finally , the influence of the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in the ann on @xmath9 , is investigated .",
    "signal recognition efficiencies obtained using evaluation libraries with event location distributions as expected and different from the signal are then compared .",
    "true - coaxial hpge detectors are considered in this paper .",
    "they have a simple radial electric field and , thus , have relatively simple pulse shapes .",
    "consequently , pulse - shapes of this type of detectors have lower systematic uncertainty due to smaller uncertainties in the field calculations compared to detectors with more complex geometries .",
    "this makes this type of detectors interesting for this analysis .",

    "the step frequency is sufficient to correctly describe trajectories  @xcite .",
    "the amplifier rc - integration constant was set to 20ns , corresponding to a bandwidth of about 10mhz , while the amplifier decay time was set to 50@xmath27s .",
    "each individual pulse shape was convoluted with gaussian noise , @xmath30kev .",
    "the results presented in this work do not change when simulated pulses with no noise are used , i.e.  the efficiencies obtained are within the uncertainties quoted in the following .",

    "training and evaluation libraries with independent pulses were created .",
    "the simulated libraries are listed in table  [ tab : libraries ] .",
