    "radial velocity measurements are of fundamental importance in astronomy . for stars , absolute radial velocities",
    "can be uncertain by as much as a km s@xmath2 because of motions in the stellar photosphere .",
    "differential velocities , on the other hand , can be much more precise yielding important information about pulsation for single stars and masses for those in double or multiple systems .",
    "the most spectacular return from high precision radial velocities in the last decade has been the detection of the minute reflex accelerations caused by unseen planetary companions for some 100 solar - type stars ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the basic design of spectrographs most commonly used to determine stellar doppler shifts has changed little in over a century .",
    "the telescope images a star on the spectrograph slit which is collimated , dispersed and then reimaged onto a detector .",
    "the principal improvements have been in detectors , from eye to photographic plate to photomultiplier or solid state array . in modern spectrographs gratings",
    "largely replace prisms for dispersion .",
    "precision in estimating wavelength displacements is compromised by motion and defocus of the star image at the slit .",
    "both translate into a displacement of the stellar spectrum relative to the comparison spectrum .",
    "flexure of the spectrograph decollimates cassegrain instruments while , for bench - mounted spectrographs , flexure of the telescope causes its optical axis to wander in the spectrograph .",
    "both effects lead to spectral shifts .",
    "@xcite thoroughly studied these effects with the mckellar spectrograph at the coud focus of the dao 1.2-m telescope from photographic spectrograms .",
    "working at a resolution of @xmath455,000 , they found that even for bright stars with well modulated spectra , there were external errors of nearly 300 m s@xmath2 , while for the sky they were closer to 100 m s@xmath2 , and internal errors were even lower at @xmath470 m s@xmath2 .",
    "they pointed out that without some scrambling of starlight at the slit , such systematic errors would remain .",
    "the subsequent introduction of pupil or image slicers reduced this discrepancy by improving the uniformity of slit illumination .",
    "@xcite , also used the mckellar spectrograph to demonstrate that , with a captive - gas to impose wavelength fiducials directly in the stellar spectrum , systematic errors could be dramatically reduced .",
    "nowadays , with iodine vapor cells , errors have been reduced to a few m s@xmath2 , the level at which precision begins to be limited by the natural velocity noise of the star s atmosphere @xcite .    for many programs it is not always possible or appropriate to include either suitable telluric lines ( generally water vapor ) or captive - gas lines such as i@xmath5 .",
    "this is certainly true for the blue / ultra - violet at high spectral resolution . in this paper",
    "we briefly demonstrate that , with minimal precautions , a precision of @xmath120 m s@xmath2 is possible for r@xmath6100,000 with a fiber - fed spectrograph over runs lasting at least several nights and probably for much longer .",
    "we became aware of this high precision following an observing run at cfht in 2001 to observe ca ii h & k in the spectra of 51  peg - type stars .",
    "these stars had been discovered to have jupiter - mass secondaries with orbital periods of a few days from precise radial velocity measurements , mostly using captive gas fiducials .",
    "such high quality radial velocity standards were not available to @xcite but offered us an excellent test of the gecko + cafe ( * ca*ssegrain * f*iber * e*nvironment ) radial velocity precision . in a run",
    "one year later we deliberately took comparison arc spectra before and after every stellar spectrum and it is these spectra which we discuss here .",
    "our data were certainly adequate to calculate improved periods for each of the stars .",
    "the revised periods and phases will be published in another paper .",
    "the observations were made on 26 to 30 july 2002 ut with the gecko chellette spectrograph fiber fed by cafe @xcite from the cassegrain focus of the canada france hawaii 3.6-m telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "spectra were centered at 3947  in the 14th order which was isolated by a uv grism with some 60  intercepted by the ccd .",
    "the dispersion was 0.0136 pixel@xmath2 and the 2.64 pixel fwhm of the thorium - argon ( th / ar ) lines corresponded to r=110,000 .",
    "the spectra were part of a long term program to monitor variations in the ca ii h & k reversals of stars with short periods ( 3 to 4.5 days ) planets .",
    "for this reason , they were of high signal - to - noise in the continuum .",
    "the detector was a back - illuminated eev ccd ( 13.5 @xmath7m@xmath8 pixels ) with spectral dispersion along the rows of the device .",
    "single th / ar arcs were taken immediately before and after each stellar spectrum and , like the flat fields , were fed through the same fiber as the starlight .",
    "probably more comparison spectra should have been taken but , as time was of the essence for this program , only single comparison spectra were taken .",
    "fiber modal noise was suppressed by continuously agitating the fiber close to its output ( see @xcite ) . a fabry lens at the fiber output projects the pupil as input to the spectrograph while simultaneously illuminating the grating with the object field .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that inversion of object and pupil improves both spectral resolution and spectral stability . in this arrangement",
    "the image projected on the grating is the fiber core output aperture enlarged 1000 times , while the fiber far field image is transformed into a pseudo slit by a four slice bowen - wallraven slicer of silicon which projects to some 50 pixels length in the spectrum . for this program",
    "there was no on - chip binning of pixels .",
    "because the ccd has a number of pixels that suffer from non - linear dark signal , we took a large number of dark exposures with integration times matching those of the various stellar , th / ar , and flat - field exposures , and created an average dark for each exposure time .",
    "then , rather than using conventional biases to remove the baseline from each observation in the data reduction , the appropriate mean darks were subtracted from the stellar , th / ar , and flat - field exposures .",
    "flat - fields were then normalized to a mean value of unity along each row and the exposures for all stars observed on a night were combined into a mean object to define a single aperture for the extraction of all stellar and comparison exposures , including subtraction of residual background between spectral orders ( prior to flat - fielding ) .",
    "this aperture was ultimately used to extract one dimensional spectra of the individual stellar and comparison exposures and a one dimensional extraction of the mean , normalized flat - field ( without an interorder background subtraction ) .",
    "the extracted stellar and comparison exposures were then divided by the one dimensional flat - field to obtain flat - fielded spectra .    a specimen , flat - fielded spectrum of @xmath9 ceti is shown in figure [ figure1 ] with the @xmath4 20  of the spectrum used to measure the radial velocities indicated .",
    "table [ table ] lists the five program stars and the standard , @xmath9 ceti , plus spectral types and u magnitudes , the planetary orbital periods and velocity amplitudes , with details of the observations such as average s / n and exposure time .",
    "radial velocities were estimated with the * fxcor * routine in iraf .",
    "the th / ar comparison lines were used to provide dispersion - corrected stellar spectra .",
    "a fourier cross - correlation was carried out on the dispersion - corrected spectra taking the first spectrum in the series for each star as the template .",
    "hence , all differential radial velocities ( @xmath10rv ) are relative to the first spectrum on the first night .",
    "both the template and the spectrum being measured were normalized with a low order polynomial and the correlation was taken over that part of the spectrum bounded by ( and including ) two strong aluminum lines ( @xmath43942 - 3963  ) .",

    "the sine curves have the published planetary orbital period and k@xmath13 from table [ table ] and were shifted in phase and @xmath10rv to give the best fit . for @xmath9 ceti there is a best fit is to a line of constant velocity . below each velocity curve",
    "are shown the @xmath10rv residuals from the curves .",
    "note that , because the amplitude of the stellar reflex velocity is very different in each case , the individual @xmath10rv scales vary widely .",
    "values of @xmath0 corresponding to the residuals are listed in table [ table ] .",
    "if four out of the 72 data points with @xmath14100 m s@xmath2 are omitted , all of the @xmath0 are @xmath1520 m s@xmath2 and the two stars observed at the highest s / n have @xmath0 @xmath410 m s@xmath2 .      the motions of the comparison spectra expressed as @xmath10rv on each of the five nights are shown in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "the results are surprising .",
    "the @xmath10rv scales on nights 3 and 5 are an order of magnitude greater than on the other three nights .",
    "nights 1 and 4 show a trend and modest scatter , with rms about the trend being 9 and 18 m s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "night 2 ( only partially clear ) shows no trend and an rms scatter of 9 m s@xmath2 .",
    "nights 3 and 5 have rms scatters of 96 and 83 m s@xmath2 , respectively !",
    "the most likely reason for spectral shifts on the detector are liquid nitrogen boil - off from the ccd dewar , distortion of the coud room floor ( earth tides , dome stress etc . ) , and spectrograph ` seeing ' effects",
    ". if these changes are slow and linear as they appear to be on nights 1 , 2 and 4 , then interpolation of the comparison line positions should properly calibrate the shifts for the stellar spectra .",
    "most of the shifts are remarkably small considering that @xmath10rv=10 m s@xmath2 corresponds to 1.3@xmath16  at 3947  which is 10@xmath17 of a pixel or 0.13 @xmath7 m .",
    "monitoring the exposure meter to estimate the centroid of the stellar exposures would have allowed more accurate barycentric velocity corrections but we did not have such a system to hand .",
    "one might expect that the large , erratic residuals on nights 3 and 5 would be reflected in large reflex residuals for the stellar radial velocities on those nights but this is not always so .",
    "the delinquent velocity for 51 peg on night 3 ( see figure [ figure2 ] ) corresponds to the very large comparison residual ( @xmath6300 m s@xmath2 ) .",
    "by contrast , the velocity for @xmath11 and observed immediately afterwards which uses the same comparison spectrum agrees within a few m s@xmath2 with the second value for @xmath11 and on that same night .    on the face of it",
    ", there is no consistent reason to reject the four large residuals .",
    "they may represent ` creaking ' in the system which introduces occasional uncalibratable jumps .",
    "unfortunately , because of the nature of the program we were not able to take comparison spectra more often than every 20 or 40 minutes . in two cases ,",
    "the comparison lines show a residual of more than 100 m s@xmath2 which is reflected as an almost equally large residual in the stellar velocity . in these cases",
    "( 51 peg and hd 209458 ) , using a mean th / ar which ignores the bad points restores the stellar velocities to the curve . in the other two cases ( @xmath9 boo and hd 209458 )",
    "there is no problem with the th / ar comparison .",
    "some of the large residuals may be inherent to the reductions and not the spectrograph .",
    "we used the same version of iraf on two different platforms , pc - iraf v2.11.3 and sun / iraf v2.11.3 .",
    "the former generated several very large residuals in the th / ar comparison positions which disappeared on reduction on a sun .",
    "the data presented in this paper were all reduced on a sun but it is still possible that some of the large residuals are artifacts of the reduction . in short , we can not be sure that occasional large residuals are not a risk with such conventionally determined velocities without a more extensive study .",
    "differential variations between the strenghts of comparison arc lines can also limit precision .",
    "the temperature of the arc , its age , ` on ' time , voltage stability etc .",
    ", cause relative line strength variations and introduce line shifts especially when lines are unresolved blends . to judge from the low scatter in the comparison spectral shifts and values of @xmath0 @xmath4 10 m s@xmath2 for the two stars observed at high s /",
    "n , variations in the arc lines has not been important above this level and this @xmath0 may be the best achievable for single spectra with this spectrograph , but a more careful study is necessary .",
    "the effectiveness of fiber agitation in overcoming modal noise has already been demonstrated @xcite . in this paper",
    "we believe we have demonstrated that the optics of the cafe fiber system which invert the conventional object and pupil @xcite illumination of slit and grating together with agitation effectively eliminates the large guiding and tracking errors which once plagued conventional radial velocity measurements .",
    "our experience suggests that comparison arcs taken with sufficient frequency are adequate to track slow spectrograph drifts for a bench mounted fiber - fed instrument in a stable environment .",
    "the precision depends on the resolution which , at 110,000 for gecko , is better than 10 m s@xmath2 .",
    "being an chellette format , the spectral curvature is small , but an chelle format would provide a multiplex gain of one or two orders of magnitude over the single spectra captured by gecko ( in this paper we only used 20  ! ) . from the point of view of radial velocities , an chelle would be much more sensitive",
    ".    instrument builders might want to consider the advantages of cafe in future spectrograph designs . from our observations",
    "alone we can not say much about the stability of such conventional radial velocities over periods of years but it will be interesting to follow it up .",
    "conventional radial velocities even of the precision reported here are not a substitute for those made with captive - gas fiducials in serious doppler planet searches but the precision is important for observations made in spectral regions remote from telluric lines or captive - gas fiducials such as we have described here .    research funding from the canadian natural sciences and engineering research council ( g.a.h.w . & e.s . ) and the national research council of canada ( d.a.b .",
    ") is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we are also indebted to the cfht staff for their care in setting up the cafe fiber system and the gecko spectrograph ."
