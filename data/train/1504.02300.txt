    "5 g communication systems need to support unprecedented requirements for the wireless access connection , targeting cell throughput capacities of @xmath0 current 4 g technology and roundtrip latency of about @xmath1 msec . towards this direction , three major 5 g technologies named ultra - densification , millimeter wave , and massive multiple - input multiple - output ,",
    "have attracted considerable attention in both industry and academia @xcite .",
    "in addition to these technological implications , physical layer issues such as transmission waveforms and multiple - access ( ma ) schemes should be reconsidered .",
    "a promising downlink ma scheme is the non - orthogonal multiple access ( noma ) which achieves high spectral efficiencies by combining superposition coding at the transmitter with successive interference cancellation ( sic ) at the receivers @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the conventional orthogonal ma schemes ( e.g. time - division multiple access ( tdma ) , etc . ) , noma simultaneously serves multiple users in the same degrees of freedom by splitting them in the power domain .",
    "since noma is based on the sic order , the served users achieve unequal rates and this could be critical for scenarios with strict fairness constraints .",
    "the work in @xcite analyzes the performance of the noma scheme in terms of outage probability and achievable sum - rate for a fixed power allocation without discussing potential fairness issues . in order to enable fairness",
    ", @xcite introduces a cooperative phase after the noma downlink , where strong users relay data for the weak users but with the cost of extra channel resources ( i.e. , dedicated time slots are used for cooperation ) . on the other hand",
    ", fairness can be supported through appropriate power allocation ( pa ) of the superimposed transmitted data flows .",
    "the main novelty of this work is the investigation of the impact of pa on the fairness performance of the noma scheme . in particular",
    ", we study the pa problem in noma from a fairness standpoint under two main system assumptions : i ) when user s data rates are adopted to the channel conditions ( perfect channel state information ( csi ) ) , and ii ) when users have fixed targeted data rates under an average csi . although the resulting optimization problems are both non - convex , we develop low - complexity bisection - based iterative algorithms that provably yield globally optimal solutions .",
    "we further illustrate that each iteration subproblem can be optimally solved in closed and semi - closed form for the two cases , with no specialized optimization software .",
    "the results show that the noma scheme outperforms conventional ma approaches by significantly improving the performance of the worst user .",
    "we assume a single - cell downlink topology consisting of one base station , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 users , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 ; all terminals are equipped with a single antenna .",
    "@xmath2 has always data to transmit for each user ( saturated scenario ) and its total available transmitted power is equal to @xmath6 .",
    "all wireless links exhibit independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "block rayleigh fading and additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "this means that the fading coefficients @xmath7 ( for the @xmath8 link ) remain constant during one slot , but change independently from one slot to another according to a complex gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath9 ; the variance captures path - loss and shadowing effects . without loss of generality ,",
    "the channels are sorted as @xmath10 i.e. , the @xmath11-th user always holds the @xmath11-th weakest instantaneous channel .",
    "the awgn is assumed to be normalized with zero mean and variance @xmath12 .",
    "the noma scheme allows @xmath2 to simultaneously serve all users by using the entire bandwidth to transmit data via a superposition coding technique at the transmitter side and sic techniques at the users ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 6.25 ) ) ; in this case , user multiplexing is performed in the power domain . according to the noma principles",
    ", @xmath2 transmits a linear superposition of @xmath3 data flows by allocating a fraction @xmath13 of the total power to the @xmath11-th data flow .",
    "each receiver employs a sic technique and is able to perfectly decode the signals of the weakest users i.e. , the @xmath11-th user can decode the signal for the @xmath14-th user with @xmath15 , removing completely inter - user interference . in this way , the @xmath11-th user can remove interference from the weakest users and its achievable rate associated with the decoding of the @xmath14-th data flow is given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 due to the ordering of the channel coefficients .      in case @xmath2",
    "does not have any instantaneous channel feedback , it transmits with a target spectral efficiency @xmath19 bits per channel use ( bpcu ) for each data flow and an appropriate performance metric is the outage probability .",
    "an outage event occurs at the @xmath11-th user when is not able to decode its own data flow or the data flows of the weakest users @xmath20 . by using high order statistics and following similar steps to @xcite ,",
    "the outage probability for the @xmath11-th user is    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( see eq .",
    "( 8) in @xcite ) , and follows from the binomial theorem .",
    "it is worth noting that here , we give a closed form expression for i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh fading , while the analysis in @xcite refers to a different channel probability distribution .",
    "the noma scheme enables a more flexible management of the users achievable rates and is an efficient way to enhance user fairness . in this section ,",
    "we consider two fundamental fairness criteria that refer to noma systems with instantaneous and average csi , respectively .",
    "if a continuous channel feedback is available at the transmitter side , users rates can be allocated according to their instantaneous channel conditions . in this case , a suitable criterion is the max - min fairness that maximizes the minimum achievable user rate and is formulated as follows    [ eq : maxminnoma ] @xmath30    problem is not convex and hence hard to solve directly using standard optimization solvers . in this section ,",
    "we transform the problem into a sequence of linear programs ( lps ) and develop a customized low - complexity polynomial algorithm for its optimal solution . towards this direction , we state proposition [ prop : maxminnoma ] .",

    "the analytical solution emanates from the fact that normalized power @xmath13 only depends on the power allocated to the stronger channels @xmath66 .",
    "hence , the optimal objective function value can be computed by allocating power from the strongest to the weakest channel in succession .",
    "notice that due to the special structure of the problem , the optimal solution can be obtained in closed form ( see ) , with all users having data rate equal to @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , it can be easily observed that the computational complexity of solving is @xmath67 , i.e. , linear to the number of users .",
    "optimizing the performance of communication systems under average csi information is an important and challenging problem with practical interest . towards this direction",
