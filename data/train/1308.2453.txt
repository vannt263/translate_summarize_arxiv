    "a determination of the superconducting ( sc ) electron pairing symmetry is an important step to establish a microscopic theory for high - transition temperature ( high-@xmath2 ) superconductivity @xcite . since the discovery of iron pnictide superconductors @xcite , a peculiar unconventional pairing state , where superconductivity arises from sign - revised quasiparticle excitations between the isotropic hole and electron fermi pockets near the @xmath11 and @xmath12 points , respectively , has been proposed @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this so - called @xmath10-pairing state is that the sign - reversed quasiparticle excitations necessitate a sharp resonance in the spin excitations spectra ( termed spin resonance ) occurring below the sum of the hole and electron sc gap energies ( @xmath13 ) at the antiferromagnetic ( af ) wave vector @xmath14 connecting the two fermi surfaces [ inset in fig .",

    "because the superconducting gap values for the multi - band iron pnictide superconductors are different for different bands @xcite , the resonance energy is determined by the superconducting gaps in electron and hole bands contributing most to the quasiparticle nesting condition @xcite .",
