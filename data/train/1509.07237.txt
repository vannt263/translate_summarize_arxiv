    "the dynamics of charge carriers in spin - orbit coupled systems is a vital area of investigation for the extremely active field of spintronics . controlling and manipulating the flow of electrons and holes serves as the foundation of an entire class of spintronic devices , most notably the datta - das spin transistor and its progeny @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of spin - orbit systems , with an eye to these potential applications , are extensive .",
    "one particularly fruitful experimental technique is transverse magnetic focussing ( tmf ) , which involves the mesoscopic transport of charge carriers from an injector quantum point contact ( qpc ) to a collector qpc , in a two dimension ( 2d ) charge gas , through which the charge carrier can propagate ballistically on a scale of tens of microns .",
    "the charge carriers are `` focused '' by out of plane magnetic field @xmath0 as illustrated in fig .",
    "the two possible trajectories shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] correspond to two possible spin polarisation .",
    "the figure illustrates that the problem under investigation is how the spin influences the semiclassical long - range orbital dynamics . as an experimental technique",
    ", tmf has provided important insights into the properties of heterostructures and quantum point contacts @xcite .",
    "more recently , tmf has been applied in graphene @xcite .",
    "another recent development is the use of two dimensional systems with large spin orbit ( so ) interactions in tmf , the goal to observe spin splitting in the magnetic focussing spectrum .",
    "such a splitting has been observed in heavy hole systems using zinc blend heterostructure @xcite .",
    "simultaneously there has been extensive theoretical investigation of tmf with rashba so interaction which is linear in the particle momentum using a variety of exact numerical @xcite , and strong and weak coupling semiclassical approximations @xcite .",
    "in addition , polarised photocurrents have been experimentally detected using tmf @xcite , and tmf has been used as an efficient method for detecting density differences in spin species in a qpc @xcite .    while extensive , theoretical investigation so far has been limited to the linear in the particle momentum so interactions , like usual rashba interaction .",
    "though often dominant in two dimensional electron systems , for heavy hole based systems the spin - orbit rashba - like interaction is cubic in momenta .",
    "particular crystal lattice orientations with respect to the 2d heterstructure in zinc - blend semiconductors result in cubic in momenta dresselhaus so interaction @xcite .",
    "application of an in - plane magnetic field to a heavy hole zinc - blend semiconductor heterostructure results in an effective so interaction which is quadratic in the particle momentum  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , most 2d systems contain so interactions of different orders in momentum simultaneously .",
    "such a combination can suppress or enhance the spin splitting , depending on the growth orientation and confinement shape .",
    "such partial , or complete compensation of spin orbit interactions forms the basis of many proposed spintronic devices .    .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ]    in light of these considerations , in this work we pursue a theoretical investigation of tmf for a wide variety of so interactions which scales as some power of the particle momentum .",
    "moreover , we consider a case when so interaction with different powers of momentum act simultaneously .",
    "we assume that the focusing magnetic field is weak and hence the evolution of the particle wave function is adiabatic .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we present theory for so interactions with a single winding number , and determining the peak position in a magnetic focussing experiment . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we extend this to the case of two so interactions acting simultaneously , and determine the change to the magnetic focussing spectrum .",
    "finally , in section [ sec3 ] we briefly examine the question of injection via the qpc with a greatly simplified model , determining the angular distribution .",
    "semiconductor heterostructures allow for a great diversity of so interactions . to render our results as more general , we consider the following spin orbit interaction for a two dimension electron or hole gas ( 2deg ) , @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the particle momentum , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , are the pauli matrices describing the effective spin 1/2",
    ". for electron systems , these matrices represent the electron spin , while for holes which have the internal angular momentum @xmath5 , the matrices describe the two level heavy hole subsystem @xmath6 , with light holes , @xmath7 , having a significantly higher energy .",
    "derivation of the kinematic form of the interaction ( [ spinorbit1 ] ) is straightforward . in the case of electrons",
    "the only possible kinematic structure is the rashba interaction @xcite , @xmath8)$ ] , where @xmath9 is electron spin and @xmath10 is the unit vector orthogonal to the plane of 2deg .",

    "for holes in an in - plane magnetic field @xmath13 the only possible kinematic structure is @xmath14 . to project this hamiltonian to the @xmath6 heavy hole subspace one",
    "has to replace @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "all other powers of @xmath17 are projected to zero .",

    "interactions the inversion asymmetry is described by the vector @xmath10 .",
    "alternatively , the n=3 case can originate from the dresselhaus so interaction which is due to the lack of inversion symmetry in the bulk of a zinc blend semiconductor @xcite . in this case the magnitude and the phase of @xmath28 depends on the orientation of the heterostructure with respect to crystal axes .",
    "the coefficient @xmath28 in eq.([spinorbit1 ] ) can be presented as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fermi energy ( chemical potential ) .",

    "the dimensionless coefficient @xmath31 represents the value of the so interaction at @xmath32 in units of the fermi energy . for the rashba - like interaction ( lack of inversion asymmetry in the heterostructure ) at @xmath33 the coefficient can as large as @xmath34 , dependent on the heterostructure quantum well . for the @xmath18 , the interaction induced by an in - plane magnetic field",

    "it is worth noting that for @xmath11 the winding number represents the rotation of the real spin .",

    "for example for @xmath18 @xmath50 does not change its direction , it is directed along @xmath51 , so it does not wind .",
    "nevertheless , for our purposes the effective spin matters , and therefore the classification by the winding numbers makes sense and is important .",

    "on the other hand the first equations which gives relation between momentum and velocity depends on the so interaction . in the semiclassical limit",
    "we have to replace the operators @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 in eqs.([velocity2 ] ) by their expectation values .",

    "note also that the fermi momentum and the fermi velocity depend on spin .",
    "when transforming from ( [ velocity2 ] ) to ( [ velocity3 ] ) we assume that the so interaction is small compared to the fermi energy , @xmath78 , we expand in powers @xmath79 keeping only the leading term .",

    "remarkably , when expressed in terms of @xmath31 the focussing length is independent of the winding number n. it does depend on the spin polarisation , and this leads to the double focusing peak . for the case of @xmath11 , the solution , ,",
