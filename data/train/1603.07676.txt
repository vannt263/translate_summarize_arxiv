    "in that system , though the clean superconductor inherits a linear - in - energy quasiparticle density of states from the massless dirac form of the excitation spectrum , the presence of disorder has the effect of redistributing states from high energy to low .",
    "here we consider , directly , the case of a disordered ti surface , which differs from the dirty @xmath7-wave case in that we have a single isotropic dirac point rather than four anisotropic ones , and most significantly , in that the 2d massless dirac hamiltonian acts upon spin - space rather than particle - hole space . rather than performing a disorder - averaged perturbative analysis ,",

    "we take the same approach here , neglecting disorder matrix elements between surface and bulk states and restricting our hilbert space to surface states with @xmath38 .",

    "it is these coefficients that will be randomly selected to determine an instantiation of the disorder potential .    as noted in ref .",

    "furthermore , since the disorder potential , @xmath69 , _ anticommutes _ with @xmath58 while @xmath19 commutes with @xmath58 , the previously degenerate time - reversed - pair states of the clean hamiltonian are shifted oppositely by weak disorder .",
    "this is so because @xmath172 where the first equality follows because @xmath173 , the second because @xmath58 is antiunitary , and the third because @xmath69 is hermitian .",

    ", states do not come in @xmath160 pairs so the noise need not satisfy any particular symmetry .",
    "when eigenstates come in @xmath160 pairs , @xmath137 is quite special . it is the energy",
    "at which eigenstates , when driven to low energy by disorder , can meet their partners and , possibly , hybridize with them .",

    "consider what happens , in either case , when disorder is strong enough to bring @xmath160 pairs close to zero energy .",
    "let @xmath180 be the small additional perturbation that would , in the absense of hybridization , make @xmath162 and @xmath181 degenerate at @xmath137 .",

    "hence , as we increase disorder strength , partner states anti - cross at zero energy , with anti - crossing gaps of varying size .",
    "this happens generically , for every disorder instantiation that drives states toward low energy , which explains why we find @xmath188 for disorder of this type . prevented , by the chiral symmetry , from reaching zero energy , states driven toward low energy build up in two symmetric peaks , with density of states falling to zero as energy goes to zero .",

    "the @xmath160 partner states therefore do not hybridize when they meet at zero energy , there is no level repulsion , and states about @xmath137 are plentiful .",
    "as we increase disorder strength , partner states simply cross at zero energy .",
    "zero energy is once again special , but now for the opposite reason .",
    "this coming together of states from positive and negative energy yields an enhancement in the density of states , resulting in a peak about @xmath137 .",
    "hence the zero - energy peak seen in fig .  [ fig : dadosz](c ) .",
    "in this paper , we have considered a topological insulator ( ti ) of spherical geometry and studied the influence of disorder on the density of surface states .",
    "this spherical ti problem is relevant both to the study of physical systems of spherical geometry ( i.e.  ti nanoparticles ) and as a theoretical construct with the purpose of providing insight regarding the physics of the flat ti surface that is recovered in the large radius limit .",
    "a great advantage of this construct is that the finite size of the spherical surface results in a discrete energy spectrum with well - defined eigenstates that is well suited to numerical analysis .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the clean ti surface hamiltonian , @xmath19 , elegantly derived and developed in refs .",

    "we then evaluated the full hamiltonian , @xmath150 , in the basis of the clean eigenstates , diagonalized to find the energy spectrum , binned the results to obtain the density of states , and averaged over 200,000 disorder instantiations to compute the disorder - averaged density of states , @xmath4 .",
    "we considered disorder of varying strength ( @xmath76 ) and of different types ( see @xmath80-vector nomenclature introduced in sec .",
    "[ ssec : random ] ) by controlling the @xmath3 covariance matrix of our zero - mean gaussian distribution .",
    "quite generically , we find that increasing disorder strength leads to the broadening , decay , and overlap of the landau level peaks that characterize the clean density of states .",
    "we observed this scenario for all the different disorder types ( characterized by different @xmath80-vectors ) that we considered .",
    "such effects are to be expected as the disorder potential thoroughly mixes the eigenstates of the clean hamiltonian .",
    "however , our results also revealed striking differences , rooted in the symmetries of the ti surface hamiltonian , between density - of - states functions calculated for different types of disorder .",
    "we found that the broadened peak structure characteristic of the weak - disorder regime manifests quite differently for spin - dependent disorder ( only the @xmath57 terms ) than it does for spin - independent disorder ( only the @xmath145 term ) .",
    "the former case results in a distinct splitting of the landau level peaks ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dadosxyz ] ) that is absent in the latter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dadoss ] ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : explanation ] , this is a consequence of the time - reversal invariance of the clean hamiltonian and the fact that the spin - dependent disorder potential terms anticommute with the time - reversal operator .",
    "furthermore , our calculations revealed significant , disorder - type - dependent differences in the structure of the strong - disorder density of states in the vicinity of zero energy .",
    "for most types of disorder , increasing disorder strength pushes states closer and closer to zero energy , resulting in a low - energy density of states that becomes nonzero for sufficient disorder and continues to increase until saturating at an energy - independent value .",
    "this is what we see for @xmath81 $ ] , @xmath85 $ ] , and @xmath82 $ ] . but",
    "something very different happens for spin - dependent disorder with @xmath2 either entirely in - surface ( @xmath83 $ ] ) or entirely out - of - surface ( @xmath141 $ ] ) , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dadosfixedvscale ] . in the in - surface case ,",
    "increasing disorder strength yields an enhancement of the density of states _ near _ zero energy but not _ at _ zero energy .",
    "the zero - energy density of states is always strictly zero , and we see a linear increase with increasing @xmath124 , up to peaks in the vicinity of @xmath138 . by contrast , in the out - of - surface case , increasing disorder strength yields a peak at zero energy , reaching a maximum value of roughly twice the constant density of states seen at higher energies . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : explanation ] , what makes these two cases so special is that for each , the full hamiltonian , @xmath150 , preserves one of the two chiral symmetries of the clean hamiltonian , @xmath19 . as a result ,",
    "eigenvalues of @xmath156 come in @xmath160 pairs , so the density of states for each individual disorder instantiation is even in @xmath121 .",
    "for this reason , the disorder - averaged density of states , @xmath4 , for these two cases ( and not the others ) are strictly even functions of energy , down to the noise ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dadosfixedvscale ] ) . also for this reason",
    ", @xmath137 is quite special in both of these cases , for it is the energy where @xmath160 partner states meet each other , given sufficient disorder .",
    "but what makes these two cases so different from each other , is that for each , it is a _ different _ chiral symmetry of the clean hamiltonian that is preserved by the full hamiltonian . in the in - surface case , @xmath195 , so the @xmath160 partner states are @xmath155 and @xmath196 , and we find that these two states hybridize when they meet , resulting in an anti - crossing ( level repulsion ) , and therefore a depletion of states at zero energy . in the out - of - surface case , @xmath197 , so the @xmath160 partner states are @xmath155 and @xmath198 , and we find that these two states _ do not _ hybridize when they meet , so there is no level repulsion , and therefore an abundance of states at zero energy .",
    "we expect that the disorder effects discussed herein should be relevant to experiment , including the spectroscopy of topological insulator nanoparticles , where an ensemble average over many nanoparticles would play the role of our disorder average .",
    "most observable would be the broadening , decay , and overlap of landau level peaks that we see generically for all types of disorder .",
    "more challenging would be the observation of the weak - disorder peak splitting that is characteristic of time - reversal - breaking disorder",
    ". and most challenging would be the observation of the low - energy ( dirac - point - vicinity ) density - of - states features that we predict for strong , time - reversal - breaking disorder of the in - surface ( @xmath83 $ ] ) and out - of - surface ( @xmath141 $ ] ) types , as the requisite control over the form of the disorder potential may be difficult to achieve .    in future theoretical work , we intend to pursue a synthesis of this disorder analysis with the interactions study performed on the same system by neupert _",
