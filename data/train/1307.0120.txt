    "studies on shadowing and specification , originating with the works of anosov and bowen , have been developing parallel to the theory of hyperbolic systems . in a crude sense",

    "the common goal is to find a true trajectory near an approximate one .",
    "they only differ in understanding what constitutes an approximate trajectory . for shadowing",
    "one traces a pseudo - orbit , while for specification one follows arbitrarily assembled finite pieces of orbits with a true orbit . a template definition for any generalization of shadowing ( or specification )",
    "might be : every approximate orbit can be traced by a true one . moreover , given a quantitative methods of measuring how well an approximate orbit resembles a true trajectory , and how closely it is traced ( followed , reproduced ) by an orbit of some point , we may restate our template definition : for every @xmath0 there is a @xmath1 such that every @xmath1-approximate orbit can be traced with error not greater than @xmath0 .",
    "this template is a base for the generalizations of both notions we investigate here : the almost specification property , the average shadowing property , and the asymptotic average shadowing property .",
    "book @xcite is a good general reference on shadowing and its generalizations , while palmer s @xcite presents their applications .",
    "properties of systems with specification are described in @xcite .    at the end of 1980s",
    "blank introduced the notion of average pseudo - orbits and proved that certain kinds of perturbed hyperbolic systems have the average shadowing property ( see @xcite ) .",
    "average pseudo - orbits arise naturally in the realizations of independent gaussian random perturbations with zero mean and in the investigations of the most probable orbits of the dynamical system with general markov perturbations , etc .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) that if @xmath2 is a basic set of a diffeomorphism @xmath3 satisfying axiom a , then @xmath4 has the average shadowing property .",
    "the notion gained considerable attention of the scientific community , see @xcite . in @xcite sakai",
    "analyzed the dynamics of diffeomorphisms satisfying the average shadowing property on a two - dimensional closed manifold .",
    "later , in @xcite , he compared various shadowing properties of positively expansive maps .",
    "the results of @xcite were generalized and completed in @xcite . in @xcite niu proved that if @xmath3 has the average shadowing property and the minimal points of @xmath3 are dense in @xmath5 , then @xmath3 is weakly mixing and totally strongly ergodic .",
    "the next property we consider is the _ asymptotic average shadowing _ introduced by gu in @xcite .",
    "gu followed the same scheme as blank , but with limit shadowing instead of shadowing as the starting point for generalization .",
    "the asymptotic average shadowing property was examined , inter alia , in @xcite .",
    "it was proved that there is a large class of systems with the asymptotic average shadowing property , including all mixing maps of the unit interval and their denjoy extensions .",
    "more recently , climenhaga and thompson ( @xcite ) , inspired by the work of pfister and sullivan @xcite , examined some properties of systems with the almost specification property , which in turn generalizes the notion of specification . as all beta shifts",
    "have the almost specification property their results apply to those important symbolic systems .",
    "we believe that techniques and notions described above deserve deeper study and the results scattered through the literature should be put into a unified framework . therefore our main goal is to explore the general properties of systems possessing generalized shadowing and/or specification in the abstract setting .",
    "it follows from our work that these generalizations are related much closer than the original notions .",
    "specification is well known to imply almost specification , and there are examples of systems with almost specification , but without specification .",
    "we show that the almost specification property implies asymptotic average shadowing property ( theorem [ thm : almost - spec - implies - aasp ] ) , which in turn implies average shadowing property ( theorem [ thm : aasp - implies - asp ] )",
    ". we do not know whether the converse implications are true when the space under consideration is compact , which is the usual setting ( question [ q : converse_implications ] ) . nevertheless , we are able to give examples of maps on noncompact metric spaces that either have the average shadowing property , but not the asymptotic average shadowing property ( example [ example1 ] ) , or have the asymptotic average shadowing property , but not the average shadowing property ( example [ example2 ] ) .",
    "we also explore recurrence properties of dynamical systems with the average shadowing property .",
    "we prove that every dynamical system with the almost specification property and full invariant measure ( a measure which is positive on each nonempty open set ) has a dense set of minimal points ( theorem [ thm : dense_minimal ] ) and that every dynamical system with the average shadowing property and full invariant measure is topologically weakly mixing ( theorem [ thm : measure+asp - imply - wm ] ) .",
    "moreover , we show that if the supports of invariant measures are not dense , then there is no recurrence property that is implied by the average shadowing property ( see section  [ sec : examples ] for multiple examples of this kind ) . in section  [ sec : sec_measure_center ]",
    "we prove that @xmath3 has the average shadowing property ( almost specification property , asymptotic average shadowing property ) provided @xmath3 restricted to its measure center ( the closure of the union of all supports of @xmath3-invariant measures ) has the average shadowing property ( almost specification property , asymptotic average shadowing property ) .    as a byproduct of our methodology",
    "we obtain a little bit surprising result ( theorem  [ limsh_chaintrans ] ) that limit shadowing in chain transitive systems implies shadowing ( and so transitivity ) .",
    "it was proved recently by lee and sakai @xcite that expansive systems with shadowing have limit shadowing ( in fact they have the so - called strong limit shadowing property , which is stronger than shadowing and limit shadowing together as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 3.5 ) ) .",
    "there are also known examples of systems with limit shadowing but without shadowing ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 1.21 ) , which may be generalized to a large class of homeomorphisms on @xmath6 $ ] ) . by the above evidence it is natural to expect that limit shadowing is a weaker property than shadowing property .",
    "in fact theorem  [ limsh_chaintrans ] and theorem  [ thm : aasp - implies - asp ] are completely opposite to the results that the authors were aiming to prove when they started working on the topics included in this paper .",
