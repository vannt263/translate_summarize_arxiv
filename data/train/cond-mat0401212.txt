    "a striking feature of superfluidity is the existence of quantised vortex filaments .",
    "quantised vortices are particularly interesting because , unlike vortices in a classical turbulent fluid , they are discrete , stable topological defects . until recently the study of quantised vorticity and quantum turbulence@xcite",
    "was mainly confined to @xmath6he , but in the last few years there has been progress in other contexts@xcite , ranging from atomic bose ",
    "einstein condensates to @xmath0he , which is a fermionic superfluid .",
    "our work is motivated by the recent discovery by finne @xcite of a sharp transition at the temperature @xmath7 between two distinct hydrodynamical regimes in @xmath0he - b , where @xmath8 is the critical temperature . in their experiment finne",
    "injected one or a few seeding vortex loops into rotating @xmath0he - b . using a non - invasive nmr measurement technique , they measured the total length of the quantised vortices as a function of time .",
    "they found that if @xmath9 the initial loops expand and straighten into rectilinear vortices which align along the axis of rotation .",
    "however , if @xmath10 , the seeding loops evolve into a turbulent vortex tangle .",
    "the effect is independent of the fluid s velocity and the details of the initial condition , which suggests the existence of a remarkable intrinsic criterion for the onset of quantum turbulence . on the contrary , the condition for the onset of turbulence in a classical fluid , that the reynolds number is large , is extrinsic , because the reynolds number depends on the geometry and the scale of the flow , not only on properties of the fluid .",
    "finne interpreted their experimental result in terms of kelvin waves on the vortex filaments - helical perturbations of the position of a vortex core away from the unperturbed straight shape ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "they argued that the superfluid vorticity is determined by the ratio @xmath11 of dissipative and inertial forces in the superfluid , in analogy with the classical reynolds number , which expresses the ratio of inertial and viscous forces in an ordinary navier  stokes fluid .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 is defined as    @xmath12    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are known@xcite mutual friction coefficients , which determine the strength of the interaction between the superfluid vortices and the normal fluid . finne noticed that , for a single superfluid vortex , it was predicted@xcite that @xmath5 is the crossover from kelvin waves which propagate ( @xmath13 ) and kelvin waves which are overdamped ( @xmath4 ) . by performing enlightening numerical simulations ,",
    "finne confirmed that , if @xmath4 an injected vortex loop straightens and becomes rectilinear , whereas if @xmath13 kelvin waves propagate freely , as predicted . in the latter case",
    ", the amplitude of the kelvin wave grows , driven by the local difference between the normal fluid velocity and the velocity of the vortex line@xcite .",
    "when the waves amplitude becomes of the same order of the average intervortex spacing , the vortices reconnect with each other , quickly forming a disordered turbulent tangle .",
    "the value of @xmath11 depends on @xmath14 , and the observed temperature @xmath15 corresponds to @xmath16 , which is indeed close to unity .",
    "the aim of our work is to reconsider the condition @xmath5 ( which for a single vortex is the crossover from free to overdamped motion ) for a large density of vortices , such as the vortex lattice in the rotating helium experiment of finne . in this",
    "the context the behaviour of the superfluid is described by the hall - vinen equations@xcite .",
    "thus , rather than individual vortex lines , we consider a continuum of vortex lines .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it allows us to explore effects which the theory of a single vortex filament can not describe , notably the presence of boundaries and the degrees of freedom represented by the coherent oscillatory motion of many vortices .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to the fact that for a single vortex , since the core radius is fixed , only @xmath17 modes ( sideway displacements of the vortex core ) are possible , whereas for a bundle of vortices any azimuthal @xmath18 symmetry is permitted .",
    "the simple question which we address is therefore the following : given a superfluid in a cylindrical container of radius @xmath19 rotating at constant angular velocity @xmath20 , thus forming a vortex lattice with a large density of vortex lines , does the condition @xmath5 represent the crossover from propagating kelvin waves to overdamped kelvin waves for _ all _ possible modes of oscillations ?",
    "the equation of motion of the superfluid in a coordinate system rotating with angular velocity @xmath21 may be written as @xmath22 \\nonumber \\\\[-1.5ex ] & & \\label{eq : vs}\\\\[-1.5ex ] \\nonumber & + & \\alpha'\\blambda \\times(\\vs-\\vn)- \\alpha\\nus\\widehat{\\blambda}\\times ( \\blambda \\bcdot \\bnabla)\\widehat{\\blambda } + \\nus(1-\\alpha')(\\blambda \\bcdot \\bnabla)\\widehat{\\blambda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the superfluid and normal fluid velocities in the rotating frame , @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a collection of scalar terms .",
    "given the high viscosity of @xmath0he - b , we assume that the normal fluid is in solid body rotation around the @xmath29-axis , thus in the rotating frame @xmath30 .",
    "( [ eq : vs ] ) must be solved under the condition that @xmath31 .",
    "the quantity @xmath32 is the vortex tension parameter , @xmath33 is the quantum of circulation , @xmath34 is the vortex core radius and @xmath35 is the average distance between vortices .",
    "the unperturbed vortex lattice corresponds to the basic state @xmath36 , @xmath37 for which @xmath38 , working in cylindrical coordinates @xmath39 .",

    "the dispersion law which we have obtained , represented by eq.s  ( [ eq : beta],[eq : eigen ] ) , has two limiting cases which have already appeared in the literature .",
    "firstly , if we set @xmath63 , we recover chandrasekhar s classical result for the modes of vibrations of a rotating column of liquid@xcite : @xmath46 is determined by @xmath64 where the values of @xmath59 are given by the roots of @xmath65 secondly , if we set @xmath66 , eq .",
