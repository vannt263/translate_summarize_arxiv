    "recently there have been paid much attention to nonequilibrium transport processes through molecular wire junctions.@xcite as the system is shrunk down to a smaller size than the mean free path of a carrier , such as an electron , a phonon , or an exciton , the ballistic quantum transport exhibits a characteristically different feature from the corresponding bulk properties .",
    "for example , it was discovered that the electronic or thermal conductance of sub - micron size one - dimensional chain is quantized at low temperature.@xcite when the system size is further shrunk down to the nanometer size , a discretized energy level structure of a nanowire plays an important role in transport processes through the resonance effect .",
    "recent ultrafast nonlinear optical spectroscopy has revealed the temporal behavior of relaxation process of the photo - excited molecular chain.@xcite also in biomolecules , such as alpha - helix protein and dna strands , which consists of molecular chain structures , the transport process in nonequilibrium state have been extensively studied in order to clarify the biofunctions of these molecules from a microscopic view point.@xcite    in order to understand the transport processes in the nonequilibrium stationary state , we need to know first of all how to describe the nonequilibrium stationary state with which a physical quantity can be obtained as an expectation value of an observable .",
    "while it is obvious that a stationary state is described by a canonical distribution in a thermal equilibrium , it is not so easy to find the explicit form of the stationary state for nonequilibrium situation .",
    "meanwhile a phenomenological landauer formula has been extensively used as a useful tool to evaluate a transport coefficient in a nonequilibrium stationary state without explicitly describing the stationary state .",
    "there have been enormous works trying to make clear its microscopic foundation and its applicability in terms of nonequilibrium green s function method , quantum langevin method , and so on .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , prigogine and his coworkers have developed a theory of the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics in terms of the complex spectral representation of the liouville - von neumann super - operator , or simply called _",
    "liouvillian_.@xcite they have clarified that the eigenvalue problem of the liouvillian is classified into independent subspaces according to the order of correlations based on the concept of the _ dynamics of the correlation _ where the fundamental object is a correlation . in a classical gas system , for example ,",
    "each correlation is characterized by the dependence of the distribution function on the wave number which characterizes the spatial correlation : the inhomogeneity is a correlation component which has a single non - vanishing wave number of a particle , while _",
    "inter - particle correlation _ is a component which has several non - vanishing wave numbers of different particles.@xcite    this classification in terms of the correlation enables to transform the eigenvalue problem of the liouvillian to the eigenvalue problem of the collision operator of the kinetic equation in a correlation subspace .",
    "it is well known that the collision operator plays a central role in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , as seen in boltzmann equation or fokker - planck equation.@xcite a striking finding of the theory is that the spectrum of the collision operator is identical with that of the liouvillian , which signifies the direct link between the microscopic dynamics governed by the liouvillian and the phenomenological kinetic theory.@xcite since the collision operator is non - hermite operator , the eigenvalues can take complex values which reflects the dissipation of the system .",
    "the eigenstate of the liouvillian is obtained from the eigenstate of the collision operator by operating a creation - of - correlation operator onto the eigenstate of the collision operator which represents the transition from a privileged correlation subspace to other non - privileged correlation subspaces.@xcite the eigenstate of the liouvillian is then represented as a series of the correlation generated by the dynamics of correlation .",
    "there have been a few applications of the theory to real physical systems,@xcite but the transport processes in nonequilibrium situations have not been fully investigated yet in the context of dynamics of correlation . our aim here is to apply the theory to the real mesoscopic system under nonequilibrium situation and to systematically derive the transport quantities in a stationary state .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider a molecular chain coupled with different thermal baths at the both ends , where a quantum particle is confined in the molecule and it ballistically transfers within the molecule . an exchange of energy occurs between the molecule and the thermal baths , while there is no particle exchange between them as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the nonequilibrium stationary state is obtained as the zero eigenstate of the liouvillian which is represented by superposition of different order of correlations .",
    "a leading term is the non - correlation component , or called _ vacuum of correlation _ , followed by the higher order correlation components .",
    "as will be shown , the inhomogeneity component of a single particle is created by the second order interaction from the vacuum of correlation .",
    "this is contrast to the case of a well - known gas system where the inhomogeneity component is disconnected from the vacuum of correlation subspace by the interaction , thus is not created from the vacuum of correlation.@xcite    once the nonequilibrium stationary state is obtained as a zero eigenstate of the liouvillian , a physical quantity is evaluated as an expectation value of a corresponding observable in the stationary state . since the nonequilibrium stationary state is an eigenstate of the liouvillian , the expression of a physical quantity is justified from the microscopic dynamics without any phenomenological assumptions .",
    "we have derived an expression of the energy flow with use of the nonequilibrium stationary state , and found that the first order correlation is responsible for the energy flow .",
    "we shall show that the expression of the energy flow is cast into the landauer formula with a characteristic transmission function , because the first oder correlation is directly related to a collision operator which gives a transition probability between the molecular states , represented by fermi s golden rule .",
    "on the other hand , the physical quantity described by the higher order correlation can not be reduced in the landauer formula . as an example",
    ", we consider the particle current which is induced by external thermal force , as in the mechanical force when a molecule is subjected to an external electric field .",
    "however , it is well - known that the treatment of the thermal force is in general much more complex than a mechanical force , because the thermal force stems from a many - body dissipative effect.@xcite we shall reveal that the particle current is attributed to the second order correlation component .",
    "since there is no direct connection between the second order correlation and the collision operator , we can not cast it into the landauer formula unlike the case of the energy flow in this problem . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we present a model hamiltonian of the molecular chain coupled with different thermal baths at its both ends .",
    "the eigenvalue problem of the liouvillian is presented in section [ sec : eigen ] to obtain the nonequilibrium stationary state as zero eigenstate of the liouvillian .",
