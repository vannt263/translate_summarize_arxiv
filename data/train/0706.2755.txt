    "in a variety of applied contexts a relevant role is played by jump - diffusion processes , i.e.  by diffusion processes to which jumps occurring at random times are superimposed .",

    "@xcite ) , of complex queueing systems ( see perry and stadje @xcite ) , of random assets in mathematical finance ( see ball and roma @xcite ) , of surplus of insurance companies in ruin theory ( see gerber and landry @xcite ) , of acto - myosin interaction in biomathematics ( see buonocore",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . despite the relevance of the first - crossing - time ( fct ) problem for jump - diffusion processes in such contexts , only few analytical results are available on their probability density function ( pdf ) , even in the case of very simple boundaries .",
    "the available results are mainly focused on equations involving the fct moments ( see , for instance , abundo  @xcite , giraudo and sacerdote  @xcite , and tuckwell @xcite ) , which however seem to be hardly manageable for practical purposes .",
    "other results concerning bounds , obtained by use of laplace transform , are limited to upper and lower bounds for the ruin probability in a jump - diffusion process involved in a risk model perturbed by brownian motion ( see yin and chiu @xcite ) , and for the mean and the variance of the hitting time in certain jump - diffusion processes ( see schl @xcite ) .",
    "analytical results on fct pdf s are also very rare ( see kou and wang @xcite , where explicit solutions of the laplace transform of the distributions of the first - crossing times are disclosed for a brownian motion perturbed by double exponentially distributed jumps ) .",
    "hence , as a viable alternative , efficient algorithms have been devised in order to evaluate fct densities ( cf .",
    "the recent contributions by atiya and metwally @xcite , and by di crescenzo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to evaluate the performance of simulation algorithms",
    ", one needs to come up with some sample cases in which fct densities and distribution functions obtained by simulation can be compared with the corresponding bounds analytically determined .",
    "hence , in the present paper lower bounds for fct densities and distribution functions will be determined for jump - diffusion processes based on the wiener process in the presence of a constant boundary .",
    "our results are based on a sample - path analysis of the jump - diffusion process and on some specific features of the underlying wiener process , such as the space and time homogeneity and the availability of a closed form of the fct density through a constant boundary .",
    "it must be pointed out that our approach is at all different from that of bischoff and hashorva @xcite , where the cameron - martin - girsanov formula is exploited to obtain a lower bound for the boundary crossing probability of brownian bridge with trend .    in section",
    "2 we formally describe the jump - wiener model , that consists of the superposition of a wiener process and of a jump process with generally distributed jumps occurring at the occurrences of a counting process .",
    "the fct problem for such process through a constant boundary is then addressed and a lower bound for the fct pdf is then determined in section  3 .",
    "use of such a bound is then made for the special case when upward and downward jumps have constant amplitudes and occur according to a poisson process .",
    "section  4 presents a lower bound for the fct cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) .",
    "the special case when only upward constant jumps are allowed , and are separed by random times having exponential distribution is thoroughly investigated . in this case",
    "the bound is improved by making use of a technique based on the comparison of fct s by the `` usual stochastic order '' . finally , in section  5 some remarks on the computational aspects are given .",
