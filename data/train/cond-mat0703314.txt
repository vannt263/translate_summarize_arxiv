    "the study of the non - equilibrium properties of quantum many body systems has recently entered a renaissance era .",
    "this has been motivated , in part , by recent experimental developments ; the rapid progress of experiments involving ultracold atoms in optical lattices , with their high degree of control and long coherence times , has opened the door to precise experimental studies of the dynamics of strongly interacting quantum systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , questions of relaxation and thermalisation for non - equilibrium systems are again receiving attention from foundational perspectives .",
    "this is partly triggered by intuition from quantum information theory where maximally or almost maximally entangled states emerge from appropriate distributions of random states [ 24 ] .",
    "one particularly fascinating setting which has recently received intensive study is that of _ quenching _ , that is , a sudden change of interaction strength [ 512 ] .",
    "several explanations for , and numerical studies of , quenched dynamics have gradually led to the formulation of a rather general body of theory and conjectures ; it has been mooted that if the system starts in the ground state of one hamiltonian then certain properties such as correlators of the system should relax to an analogue of the thermal state of the new hamiltonian after a quench [ 5 , 79 ] .",
    "thus we are motivated by these observations to formulate a conjecture",
    ". this _ local relaxation conjecture",
    "_ states that a system should locally relax to a steady state , respecting conserved quantities of motion .",
    "the local relaxation conjecture may sound suspiciously like a violation of unitarity as the global state must , of course , remain pure throughout the dynamics . however , a reasonable physical intuition which explains why there is no contradiction is that for a small block of sites the rest of a system acts like a reservoir and thus allows the site to maximise its entropy subject to the constraint that the energy is preserved .",
    "indeed , the full explanation for the emergence of a local steady state during the course of the quench may be intuitively described along these lines : as time evolves the system becomes correlated @xcite  from each site a wavefront moving at the speed of sound for the lattice emerges carrying information . as time progresses more and more excitations will have passed through a given site , see fig .  1 .",
    "the cumulative effect of these successive excitations results in an effective averaging process ; information stored in one site becomes infinitely diluted across the lattice as time progresses .",
    "a similar intuition has been recently emphasised by calabrese and cardy @xcite in the context of quenching to a critical system .",
    "intuitive picture of the relaxation process in the quenched bose - hubbard model as discussed in the main text : for any lattice site @xmath0 ( or any block of sites ) within a cone ( dark grey ) defined by the speed of sound excitations significantly contribute to the local mixing of the state at the site .",
    "contributions from outside this cone ( light grey ) are exponentially suppressed .",
    "the incommensurate influence of the lattice sites in the cone gives rise to a relaxation to maximal entropy for large times @xmath1 .",
    "when the excitations have travelled through the entire lattice , recurrences will occur.,width=377 ]    in this work we introduce a physical setting where the local relaxation conjecture can be studied analytically .",
    "we find an exact convergence of all local states to a steady state for long times in the quenched bose - hubbard model .",
    "we imagine the system starts in a mott insulator phase and is then suddenly switched to the deep superfluid regime .",
    "our method is self - contained and physically motivated , and is valid also for finite system sizes relevant to experimental settings .",
    "in the course of the proof we are also able to quantify the dilution of information throughout the lattice .",
    "thus , our approach is considerably simpler and more physically intuitive than a potential approach based on the @xmath2-algebraic arguments developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the local relaxation of free fermions and bosons freely moving in @xmath3 and classical systems @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the convergence is not only true in the _ time average _ , but actually true for any large instant of time .",
    "this is in contrast to the recent approaches developed in quantum information @xcite , where , in order to study this problem , it would seem necessary to consider the time - averaged local state rather than the local state itself .",
    "additionally , our approach does not require the system being quenched to to be critical  we obtain the same results regardless of whether the system being quenched to is critical or not . for blocks of sites",
    "we also find a relaxation , but not to the thermal state of the new hamiltonian .",
    "we start from a bose - hubbard hamiltonian , modeling , for example , a dilute gas of ultra - cold atoms which are bose - condensed in an optical lattice @xcite . in one dimension ( generalizations of our findings to higher dimensions",
    "are entirely straightforward ) it reads @xmath4 , where @xmath5 here @xmath6 denote the bosonic annihilation operators , and @xmath7 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath8 is the _ hopping matrix element _ , governing the strength of hopping to neighboring sites ( @xmath9 indicates summation over nearest neighbors ) and @xmath10 defines the strength of the on - site interaction .",
    "finally , the chemical potential @xmath11 controls the particle number . for theoretical simplicity",
    "we shall assume that that the system is translationally invariant with periodic boundary conditions , so that the underlying lattice is a ring .",
    "this hamiltonian exhibits two distinct phases as @xmath8 and @xmath10 are varied .",
    "when the hopping dominates , that is @xmath12 , the system is in a _",
    "superfluid phase_. for a dominant on - site repulsion the ground state is a _",
    "mott insulator_.    we imagine that the system is initially held at chemical potential @xmath11 and is in the ground state in the mott regime @xcite . in this deep mott phase ( corresponding to @xmath13 ) the ground state vector is a product @xmath14 of individual number state vectors @xmath15 of @xmath16 bosons at each site . here , @xmath17 \\}$ ] , where @xmath18 $ ] denotes the closest integer to the value in brackets .",
    "we then imagine that the system is rapidly _ quenched _ , at @xmath19 , to the strong superfluid regime @xmath12 .",
    "we model this quench by an instantaneous change in the hamiltonian to the regime @xmath20 .",
    "thus the system state vector at time @xmath1 , @xmath21 , is given by ( we set @xmath22 ) @xmath23",
    "as outlined earlier , we are interested in whether subsystems consisting of single sites or blocks thereof equilibrate , and , if so , in what sense . for clarity",
    "we start by proving relaxation for the quantum state @xmath24 of a single site @xmath0 in the lattice @xmath25 $ ] , and then extend this result to multiple sites and different initial conditions .",

    "for more general initial states exhibiting time dependent second moments see section  [ sec : moregeneral ] .",
    "our main result can thus be summarised as @xmath34 where the limit of large @xmath35 is taken first and then the limit of large @xmath1 is taken  note that there is no time average involved .",
    "more precisely , for any @xmath36 and any recurrence time @xmath37 we can find a system size @xmath35 such that @xmath38.\\ ] ] here , the relaxation time @xmath39 is governed by the hopping strength @xmath8 , which defines the speed of sound of the system , see eq .",

    "closeness of @xmath24 and @xmath30 is measured in trace norm which of course means that _ all _ local expectation values are the same as for the relaxed state .",
    "another way of interpreting the relaxation to a gaussian state is that the entanglement between the site @xmath0 and the rest of the chain becomes maximal .    for clarity",

    "thus we may write @xmath111 the laguerre polynomials are defined as @xmath112 where we defined @xmath113 for later use .",
    "hence @xmath114 from the definition of @xmath57 and the unitarity of @xmath115 , the first summation evaluates to @xmath116 , which is quadratic as desired , and the remainder of the proof consists of showing that the remaining terms tend to zero for given @xmath42 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath125 , i.e. , also @xmath126 . we thus finally obtain the upper bound @xmath127 for the absolute value of the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : log_expansion ] ) .    equipped with these bounds ,",

    "( [ eq : trange ] ) .",
    "since pointwise closeness for the characteristic functions of two quantum states translates to closeness in trace norm for the states themselves @xcite , we have completed the argument for a single site .",
    "we therefore find that the state of a single site , in the limit of large @xmath1 , maximises the entropy for the given initial second moments : gaussian states have this extremal property of having maximal entropy .",
    "another way of saying this is that , subject to this constraint , it is _ maximally entangled _ with the rest of the chain . since we can bound the time scale on which relaxation occurs  the single site relaxes to a gaussian state at the rate @xmath131  our argument is robust under small perturbations .",
    "this result also gives a clear handle on the situation for finite system sizes : for any finite system size @xmath35 , there will of course eventually be recurrences .",
    "the time scale for such recurrences to occur in the @xmath132 plane is governed by the speed of sound and the system size @xmath35 : when @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the speed of sound , there will be no recurrences , and our argument will apply , giving rise to the time @xmath40 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : trange ] ) .",
    "thus we also arrive at a precise way to describe relaxation for _ infinite system size _ : locally the system `` looks exactly relaxed '' for large times , apparently giving the impression of an `` irreversible dynamics '' .",
    "the same result also holds for correlation functions .",
    "this _ local relaxation _ is perfectly consistent with the unitary dynamics of the full system ; the whole system never truly relaxes to an equilibrium state as it must always preserve the _ full memory _ of the initial condition .",
    "the gaussian character of the state can also be viewed as resulting from a different type of central limit theorem ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the intuition is that time evolution can be thought of as a sequence of of beam splitters acting in parallel , i.e.  a quantum quincunx or galton s board ( this follows from the fact that the dynamics are well - approximated by a quantum cellular automaton ) .",
    "after the bosons bounce through the quincunx we should arrive at a gaussian characteristic function in phase space describing the state of any single site .",
    "the equilibration for multiple sites , which includes blocks of lattice sites , may be shown using identical techniques , and here we briefly describe the necessary , but minor , modifications .",

    "that is , the block tends to a product of maximal entropy states .",

    "in other words , although the system does mix and we do arrive at a state with local maximal entropy , it does _ not _ relax to the thermal state of the new hamiltonian : the conserved second moments prevent this from happening . the relaxation should be thought of as resulting from a mixing process rather than of a physical thermalisation process . of course",
    "the second moments are locally preserved by the dynamics , so under this constraint the entropy is indeed maximised .",

    "physically , one of three different processes can take place . in the first case , @xmath209 ,",
    "the system is quenched to a state in the same phase . in this case",
    "we do not expect local relaxation as the density of quasiparticles of , eg .",
    ", @xmath210 with respect to the new hamiltonian is too low : there are not enough quasiparticles to lead to an averaging effect . in the critical case @xmath211 ,",
    "the quasiparticles are delocalised and we expect that the density of quasiparticles in @xmath210 is high enough to lead to a local relaxation . finally , in the case @xmath212 , the quasiparticles of the new system are strongly localised , and appear as pairs in the state @xmath210 which then oscillate locally .",
    "let us now turn to the critical case @xmath213 , where we expect relaxation .",
    "we find @xmath214_{i , i}=-\\frac{1}{n }      \\sum_{k=1}^n      \\sin^2(2t\\sin(\\pi k / n ) ) , \\nonumber\\\\      & -&\\frac{1}{n }      \\sum_{k=1}^n\\sin^2(2t\\sin(\\pi k / n ) )      { \\mathrm{e}}^{2\\pi{\\mathrm{i}}k / n},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term approaches @xmath215 and the second term goes to zero for large @xmath35 , @xmath1 , i.e. , indeed , at each site the system relaxes when evolved in time under this critical hamiltonian .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the relaxation of bose - hubbard type systems and related models following a sudden quench .",
    "the intuition we developed was that within a causal cone of neighboring lattice sites , the incommensurate influence of the propagating quasiparticles will give rise to a relaxation dynamics .",
    "we have considered a setting in which we could prove an exact local relaxation to a maximal entropy state , providing a guideline of what is expected to happen in similar cases .",
    "also , a precise understanding follows for the scaling of this effect in the system size , as well as of relaxation times .",
    "indeed , the system `` looks '' perfectly relaxed , while at the same time keeping a perfect memory of the initial situation .",
    "we hence can clarify the difference between an apparent  which does happen  and an actual global  which does not happen ( ! )  relaxation . the argument presented here",
    "is expected to be valid whenever the initial condition is sufficiently clustering , so if one has an appropriate decay of correlations .    from the perspective of kinematical approaches to quantum statistical problems",
    ", one can interpret our results as follows : when randomizing over all possible pure states @xcite , the local state will have maximal entropy for large systems . here , we arrive at the same result , but not by a _",
    "kinematical _ argument , but via a _",
    "dynamical _ argument , where the mixing is achieved through local physical dynamics in a lattice system .",
    "it would be interesting to further try to combine the kinematical and dynamical pictures for more general hamiltonians .",
    "settings similar to those discussed here are readily accessible in _ experiments _ using ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices @xcite , and this is what motivates this work .",
    "the general guideline is that local or correlation functions will relax .",
    "most accessible would be a situation where only second moments would have to be monitored , starting , e.g. , with a checkerboard type situation of alternating occupation numbers in a mott state ( cp .",
    "section  [ sec : moregeneral ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : secondmoments ] ) , prepared using two distinct optical lattices in a spatial dimension .",
    "the idealized case of a vanishing interaction @xmath10 gives rise to a guideline for what to expect in realistic settings and also to a general principle : the local relaxation conjecture .",
    "it is our hope that the present work fosters further experiments along these lines .",
