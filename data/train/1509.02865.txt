    "magneto - optical coupling effects reflecting the interactions between light and magnetism are fundamental phenomena in solid state physics .",
    "@xcite originally , faraday  @xcite and kerr  @xcite discovered , respectively , that when a linearly polarized light beam hits a magnetic material , the polarization plane of the transmitted and reflected light beams rotates .",
    "although magneto - optical faraday and kerr effects have been known for over a century , they have become the subjects of intense investigations only in the past decades , mainly due to the applications of optical means in modern high - density data - storage technology .",
    "@xcite faraday effect attracts less attention than kerr effect because it can only occur in ultra - thin films , where complexities of multiple reflections and discontinuous polarizations at the interfaces with the substrate arise .",
    "in contrast , magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke ) is widely used as a powerful probe of the electronic and magnetic properties of materials , such as the domain wall ,  @xcite surface plasma resonance ,  @xcite magnetic anisotropy ,  @xcite and topological insulator .",
    "@xcite    band exchange splitting caused by magnetization together with relativistic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) has been recognized as the origin of moke .",
    "@xcite therefore , moke has been explored extensively in various ferromagnetic transition metals as well as their alloys and compounds . by ferromagnets here",
    "we meant the magnetic materials with net magnetization including ferrimagnets .",
    "experimentally , erskine and stern  @xcite first reported the moke spectra of bulk fe , co , ni , and gd , and discussed their relationships with @xmath2-band widths and electron spin polarizations .",
    "after that , large kerr rotation angles of @xmath31.0@xmath4 were observed in several mn - based ferromagnetic alloys , such as ptmnsb ,  @xcite mnbi ,  @xcite and mnpt@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite on the theoretical side , first - principles density functional calculations can directly capture the moke spectra with an impressive accuracy compared to experiments .",
    "for instance , guo and ebert  @xcite studied the the moke spectra in bulk fe and co as well as their multilayers .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite focused on the surface effect and structural dependence of the moke spectra in co thin films and copt alloys , and stroppa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed the electronic structure and magneto - optical property of uniformly mn - doped gaas .",
    "very recently , rosa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite also performed the study of the magneto - optical property of mn - doped gaas in a special digital ferromagnetic heterostructure .",
    "moreover , ravindran _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the magnetic , optical , and magneto - optical properties of manganese pnictides and found a systematic increase of the kerr rotation angles from mnas , to mnsb , and to mnbi .",
    "although moke experiments have been almost always conducted on various types of ferromagnets in the past  @xcite , no explicit conclusion has been established that moke _ must be _ absent when either magnetization or soc is not present . in particular , whether moke can arise from a spin non - polarized system ( without magnetization ) or not is still an open question .",
    "remarkably , chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite recently revealed that the anomalous hall effect , which has a physical origin akin to that of moke , is large in noncollinear antiferromagnet mn@xmath5ir with zero net magnetization .",
    "this surprising result stems from the fact that in a three - sublattice kagome lattice with a noncollinear triangle antiferromagnetic configuration , not only the time - reversal symmetry @xmath6 is broken but also there is no spatial symmetry operation @xmath7 which , in combination with @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath8 , is a good symmetry that preserves the kramers theorem . in other words , band exchange",
    "splitting exists in this system despite of zero net magnetization .",
    "naturally , it would be interesting to explore possible moke in mn@xmath5ir as well as its isostructural materials mn@xmath5rh and mn@xmath5pt , which are widely considered as the promising candidates in information - storage devices due to their prominent exchange - bias properties  @xcite and high nel temperatures .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we present a comprehensive first - principles study of moke in spin non - polarized systems , focusing on antiferromagnets mn@xmath0 ( @xmath1 = rh , ir , or pt ) in two low - energy noncollinear spin structures .",
    "we show that , because of the strong soc and the breaking of band double - degeneracy , the absorption rates of the left- and right - circularly polarized lights differ significantly , giving rise to a previously undetected moke in these antiferromagents without net magnetization .",
    "the kerr rotation angles of mn@xmath0 increase from @xmath1 = rh , to ir , and to pt , due to the increased soc strength of the @xmath1 atom .",
    "the largest one of @xmath30.6@xmath4 in mn@xmath5pt is comparable to those of elemental transition metals , such as fe and co , reported previously  @xcite .",
    "our first - principles calculations also show that the moke would diminish if the soc is switched off , demonstrating the essiential role of the soc for the occurrence of the moke in these systems .",
    "our theoretical results suggest noncollinear antiferromagnets mn@xmath0 to be an interesting material platform for further studies of novel magneto - optical phenomena and technological applications .",
    "moke generally refers to the change in the polarization property of light when it interacts with magnetism , that is , a linearly polarized light shone on the surface of a magnetic sample will become elliptically polarized in the reflected beam .",
    "the ellipticity @xmath9 and kerr angle @xmath10 ( rotation of the major axis relative to the polarization axis of the incident beam ) are widely used to probe and characterize magnetic materials . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are usually combined into the complex kerr angle , @xmath11 . depending on the directions of photon propagation and magnetization vector with respect to the surface plane , there are three different geometries of the kerr effect , namely , the polar , longitudinal , and transverse geometries .",
    "of these , the polar geometry usually has the largest complex kerr angle and thus is the most interesting one in connection with technological applications . in this paper , we consider the polar geometry as a prototype and the other two geometries can be obtained similarly .    for a solid with at least threefold rotational symmetry ,",
    "the elements of optical conductivity tensor satisfy @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in such a case , the absorptive parts of optical conductivity tensor ( real diagonal and imaginary off - diagonal elements ) due to interband transitions , can be obtained using the kubo s formula within the linear response theory ,  @xcite @xmath14\\delta\\left(\\omega-\\omega_{jj^{\\prime}}\\right),\\label{eq:1 } \\\\",
    "\\sigma_{xy}^{2}\\left(\\omega\\right ) & = & \\frac{\\lambda}{\\omega}\\sum_{\\bm{k},jj^{\\prime}}\\left[\\left|\\pi_{jj^{\\prime}}^{+}\\right|^{2}-\\left|\\pi_{jj^{\\prime}}^{-}\\right|^{2}\\right]\\delta\\left(\\omega-\\omega_{jj^{\\prime}}\\right),\\label{eq:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a material specific constant , @xmath16 the photon energy , @xmath17 the energy difference between the occupied and unoccupied bands at the same @xmath18-point , and @xmath19 the dipole matrix elements for circularly polarized light with @xmath20 and @xmath21 helicity , respectively . the corresponding dispersive parts , namely , the imaginary diagonal element @xmath22 and real off - diagonal element @xmath23 , can be obtained by use of the kramer - kronig transformation .",
    "@xcite in the polar geometry , the complex kerr angle of a sample with higher than threefold rotational symmetry , is simply given as ,  @xcite @xmath24 which can be explicitly evaluated from the optical conductivity tensor calculated from the electronic structure of the solid concerned .",
    "since the intraband transitions contribute little to the off - diagonal elements of optical conductivity tensor in the magnetically ordered materials  @xcite and affect mainly the moke spectra below 1@xmath32 ev ,  @xcite here we take into account only the interband transition contribution as expressed in eqs .",

    "[ fig : crystal](c ) and  [ fig : crystal](d ) . due to",
    "strong exchange - interactions acting on the mn moments , the nel temperatures in these mn - based alloys is as high as 475 k in mn@xmath5pt ,  @xcite 855 k in mn@xmath5rh ,  @xcite and 960 k in mn@xmath5ir .",
    "@xcite    the calculated total energy and spin magnetic moments together with previously reported experimental and theoretical results are listed in table  [ tab : spin ] . clearly , t1 is the magnetic ground state of the mn@xmath0 alloys , being in good agreement with previous experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite works .",
    "nevertheless , the energy difference between the t1 and t2 spin configurations is small ( being in the order of @xmath31 mev ) , @xmath35 , the t1 and t2 are nearly degenerate . indeed , in the absence of the soc , all the t1 , t2 and t3 spin structures have the same total energy because they are equivalent .",
    "note that the t2 configuration here is not the same as the t2 magnetic structure reported in ref .  .",
    "our total energy calculations show that for mn@xmath5ir , the total energy of the t2 structure in ref .   is @xmath36.4 mev higher than the t2 configuration here , and thus should be refered to as the t3 spin configuration .",
    "the calculated spin magnetic moment of the @xmath1 atom is always zero , due to its special site - symmetry , while those of the mn atoms have nearly identical values of @xmath36 for all the three states .",
    "the calculated spin magnetic moments agree fairly well with previous reports .  @xcite further inspecting the total magnetization , we find a nonvanishing component along the @xmath37 ( @xmath32 ) direction for t1 ( t2 ) states , because the mn moments rotate slightly away from the ( 111 ) plane within a very small angle of @xmath38 .",
    "nonetheless , the mn@xmath0 alloys could still be safely considered as spin non - polarized systems in the sense that the net total magnetization is very small and hardly affacts the physical quantities of interest here , such as optical conductivities and moke spectra , as will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "note that this small spin - canting is caused by the presence of the soc .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) , it is clear that @xmath40 measures the average in the absorption of left- and right - circularly polarized light while @xmath39 measures the corresponding difference . in figs .",
    "[ fig : adsorption](a ) and  [ fig : adsorption](b ) , we show the @xmath40 for the t1 and t2 spin configurations in the energy range of 0@xmath36 ev , respectively .",
    "since the @xmath40 is directly related to the joint density of states and interband transition probability but does not depend strongly on the details of the spin structure ,  @xcite it is not surprising that the calculated @xmath40 are nearly the same for the two different spin configurations .",
    "moreover , the @xmath40 for all the three mn@xmath0 alloys have similar behaviors , mainly due to their isostructural nature . in particular",
    ", the @xmath40 for all the three alloys has a prominent broad peak centered at 2.5 ev .",
    "the @xmath39 for the t1 and t2 configurations are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : adsorption](c ) and  [ fig : adsorption](d ) , respectively . for both configurations",
    ", the @xmath39 of all the three mn@xmath0 alloys have pronounced oscillatory peaks in the low energy region and its magnitude reduces gradually to a small value above 6 ev ( not shown ) . for each individual mn@xmath0 alloy ,",
    "the @xmath39 for the t1 and t2 states differ in sign , due to the opposite total spin magnetic moments ( see table .",
    "[ tab : spin ] ) , although they are similar in line shape and magnitude .",
    "positive ( negative ) @xmath39 suggests that the interband transitions are dominated by the excitations due to the left ( right ) circularly polarized light .",
    "interestingly , the sign of the @xmath39 for the t1 structure can be reversed by reversing the mn spin moments while that for the t2 structure remains unchanged when the chirality of the spin structure is reversed .    ) as well as ( c ) and ( d ) real off - diagonal ( @xmath41 ) components of optical conductivity tensor for the t1 and t2 spin configurations of the mn@xmath0 alloys .",
    "both @xmath42 and @xmath41 are broadened with a lorentzian of 0.1 ev to simulate the finite lifetime effect of electron . ]",
    "physically speaking , the _ dc _ limit of the imaginary off - diagonal element of optical conductivity , @xmath43 , is nothing but the anomalous hall conductivity ,  @xcite which can also be precisely evaluated by the integration of the berry curvature over the brillouin zone .",
    "@xcite chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite recently pointed out that the anomalous hall effect can arise from noncollinear antiferromagnet mn@xmath5ir in the t1 spin structure without net magnetization due to the absence of certain spatial symmetries .",
    "this could be understood in terms of the fact that in the kagome lattice [ the ( 111 ) plane of the mn@xmath0 alloys , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : crystal ] ( c ) and ( d ) ] there is no spatial symmetry @xmath7 such as mirror and rotation that in combination with the time - reversal symmetry @xmath6 ( i.e. , the @xmath44 ) can be a good symmetry such that the band kramers degeneracy will be kept in the system with broken time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "this is certainly in contrast to the case of , e.g. , a collinear bipartite antiferromagnet , where the combination of the translational operation of half of a lattice vector with the time - reversal operation is a good symmetry that will preserve the band kramers degeneracy despite of the broken trs due to the antiferromagnetism .",
    "this lifting of the band kramers degeneracy together with the strong soc in the mn@xmath0 alloys gives rise to the nonzero anomalous hall conductivity .",
    "similarly , one can expect that the @xmath45 at optical frequencies would be nonzero as well and from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , result in nontrivial magneto - optical kerr effect in the mn@xmath0 alloys , which will be discussed in next subsection .",
    "of course , one may argue that the nonzero @xmath39 could be due to the nonzero total spin magnetic moment in the t1 and t2 spin structures ( table i ) . to clarify this",
    ", we also calculate the @xmath39 spectrum from the electronic structure with a zero spin magnetic moment obtained by forcing all the mn moments lying in the ( 111 ) plane , and the calculated @xmath39 spectrum ( not shown here ) is nearly identical to that obtained without fixing the mn moments to lie in the ( 111 ) plane .",
    "the dispersive parts of optical conductivity , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath42 and @xmath41 , can be obtained from the corresponding absorptive parts by use of the kramers - kronig transformation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] , we plot the @xmath42 and @xmath41 for the t1 and t2 spin configurations , respectively . figs .  [",
    "fig : dispersion](a ) and  [ fig : dispersion](b ) show that , similar to the @xmath40 , the @xmath42 are almost the same for the t1 and t2 configurations .",
    "the @xmath42 for all the mn@xmath0 alloys have common characteristics such as a broad valley around 1.0@xmath31.5 ev , a negative to positive crossing point at 2.5 ev , and a broad plateau above 3.0 ev . figures  [ fig : dispersion](c ) and  [ fig : dispersion](d ) show that the @xmath41 for the t1 and t2 configurations have similar profiles but opposite in sign , and gradually decay to small values in the high energy region , which are similar to the behavior of @xmath39 .",
    "alloys : kerr rotations ( upper panels ) and kerr ellipticities ( lower panels ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the largest kerr rotation angles . ]      after discussing the magnetic and optical properties of the mn@xmath0 alloys , we now turn our attention to their magneto - optical property . from the complex kerr angle spectra presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : moke ] , one can find their key features as follows : ( 1 ) the calculated kerr rotation angles ( @xmath10 ) and ellipticities ( @xmath9 ) for the t1 and t2 states have opposite signs , inheriting from the behaviors of the off - diagonal elements of optical conductivity , @xmath41 [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : dispersion](c ) and  [ fig : dispersion](d ) ] and @xmath39 [ see figs .  [",
    "fig : adsorption](c ) and  [ fig : adsorption](d ) ] ; ( 2 ) the sign reversals of @xmath10 and @xmath9 are frequent in the given energy range .",
    "when @xmath9 crosses the zero line , a peak turns up in the corresponding @xmath10 spectrum , and vice versa , which may be ascribed to the kramers - kronig relation ; ( 3 ) the overall features and maximum values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 have a size sequence of mn@xmath5pt @xmath46 mn@xmath5ir @xmath46 mn@xmath5rh , which suggests that the soc strength of the @xmath1 atom contributes significantly to the enhancement of the moke spectra ; ( 4 ) the largest kerr rotation angle that appears in mn@xmath5pt is @xmath30.6@xmath4 at incident photon energy of 0.7 ev .",
    "this angle arising from a noncollinear antiferromagnet is remarkably large and comparable to those of transition metals , such as the bulk and multilayers of fe and co studied earlier .",
    "@xcite    finally , we attempt to analyze the origin of the large moke in the mn@xmath0 alloys .",
    "equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) indicates that a peak in a kerr spectrum could stem from either a small @xmath47 in the denominator or a large @xmath45 in the numerator , which are called the  optical \" and  magneto - optical \" origins , respectively . from figs .",
    "[ fig : dispersion](c ) and  [ fig : moke](a ) , one can observe that the positions of the peaks of @xmath41 and @xmath10 for the t1 state overlap with each other , such as the first peak at 0.7 ev in mn@xmath5pt and the twin peaks in the low energy range of 0@xmath31.0 ev in mn@xmath5ir , and the same can be seen for the t2 state by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion](d ) with fig .",
    "[ fig : moke](b ) .",
    "furthermore , the positions of the peaks of @xmath9 and @xmath39 are close , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : adsorption](c ) and  [ fig : adsorption](d ) as well as figs .",
    "[ fig : moke](c ) and  [ fig : moke](d ) , respectively .",
    "thus , the magnitudes of the peaks of @xmath10 and @xmath9 are modulated by the @xmath47 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : adsorption](a ) and  [ fig : adsorption](b ) as well as figs .",
    "[ fig : dispersion](a ) and  [ fig : dispersion](b ) , respectively . since the kerr rotation angle and",
    "also the ellipticity entangle in a complicated way with both the real and imaginary components of the optical conductivity tensor , there are no analytic forms for strictly separating the  optical \" and  magneto - optical \" origins for them . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonzero @xmath45 is clearly the root cause for the emergence of the kerr effect in this kind of noncollinear antiferromagnets , as already discussed in the preceding subsection .",
    "this is corroborated by our test calculations which show that both the @xmath45 and moke in these antiferromagnets would become zero without the soc included .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded that the large moke in the mn@xmath0 alloys has a  magneto - optical \" origin rather than the  optical \" origin .",
    "in conclusion , using first - principles density functional calculations , we have investigated the possible magneto - optical kerr effect in noncollinear antiferromagnets mn@xmath5rh , mn@xmath5ir and mn@xmath5pt .",
    "we found that the kerr rotation angle can be as large as @xmath30.6@xmath4 in mn@xmath5pt , which is comparable to that in elemental transition metal ferromagnets such as bcc fe .",
    "we also discussed the differences in the magneto - optical responses for the t1 and t2 spin configurations .",
    "the surprisingly large magneto - optical kerr effect in noncollinear antiferromagnets with nearly zero magnetization is attributed to the nontrivial off - diagonal components of optical conductivity , _",
    "i.e. , _ having the so - called  magneto - optical \" origin .",
    "our results demonstrate that one can not assume _ a priori _ vanishing magneto - optical kerr effect in antiferromagnets with zero net magnetization .",
    "the large kerr rotation angle , plus other interesting physical properties of the mn@xmath0 alloys , such as prominent exchange - bias properties  @xcite and high nel temperatures  @xcite , would make these materials an exciting platform for exploring novel information - storage devices .",

    "<S> magneto - optical kerr effect , normally found in magnetic materials with nonzero magnetization such as ferromagnets and ferrimagnets , has been known for more than a century . here , using first - principles density functional theory , we demonstrate large magneto - optical kerr effect in high temperature noncollinear antiferromagnets mn@xmath0 ( @xmath1 = rh , ir , or pt ) , in contrast to usual wisdom . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated kerr rotation angles are large , being comparable to that of transition metal magnets such as bcc fe . the large kerr rotation angles and ellipticities are found to originate from the lifting of the band double - degeneracy due to the absence of spatial symmetry in the mn@xmath0 noncollinear antiferromagnets which together with the time - reversal symmetry would preserve the kramers theorem . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that mn@xmath0 would provide a rare material platform for exploration of subtle magneto - optical phenomena in noncollinear magnetic materials without net magnetization . </S>"
