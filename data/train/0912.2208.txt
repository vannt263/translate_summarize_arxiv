    "in many scientific studies the knowledge of derivatives of a given quantity is of particular importance .",
    "for example in theoretical physics , especially in thermodynamics , many quantities of interest require the calculation of derivatives of an underlying thermodynamic potential with respect to some external parameters such as temperature , volume , or chemical potentials .",
    "in many cases the thermodynamic potentials can only be evaluated numerically and one is forced to employ numerical differentiation techniques which are error - prone as any numerical methods .",
    "furthermore , the thermodynamic potential has to be evaluated at the physical point defined by minimizing the thermodynamic potential with respect to some condensates yielding the equations of motion ( eom ) .",
    "generally , these equations can be solved only numerically and thus introduce additional implicit dependencies which makes the derivative calculations even more complicated .    even in cases where",
    "the thermodynamic potential and the implicit dependencies on the external parameters are known analytically , the evaluation of higher - order derivatives becomes very complex and tedious and in the end impedes their explicit calculation .    in this work we present a novel numerical technique , based on algorithmic differentiation ( ad ) to evaluate derivatives of arbitrary order of a given quantity at machine precision .",
    "compared to other differentiation techniques such as the standard divided differentiation ( dd ) method or symbolic differentiation , the ad produces truncation - error - free derivatives of a function which is coded in a computer program .",
    "additionally , ad is fast and reduces the work required for analytical calculations and coding , especially for higher - order derivatives .",
    "furthermore , the ad technique is applicable even if the implicit dependencies on the external parameters are known only numerically . in ref .",
    "@xcite a comprehensive introduction to ad can be found .",
    "first remarks about the computation of derivative of implicitly defined functions were already contained in  @xcite .",

    "this model is widely used for the description of the low - energy sector of strongly interacting matter . as a starting point the basic thermodynamic grand potential and the eom of this model are calculated in a simple mean - field approximation in order to elucidate the technical problems common in such types of calculations . before we demonstrate the power of the ad method by calculating certain taylor expansion coefficients up to very high orders for the first time in sec .",

    "in order to illustrate the key points of the ad method we employ a quantum field theoretical model @xcite . this model can be used to investigate the phase structure of strongly interacting matter described by the underlying theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "details concerning this effective linear sigma model ( l@xmath0 m ) in the qcd context can be found in reviews , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the quantity of interest for the exploration of the phase structure is the grand potential of the l@xmath0 m .",
    "this thermodynamic potential depends on the temperature @xmath1 and quark chemical potential @xmath2 because the particle number can also vary .",

    "consists of two contributions @xmath4 where the first part , @xmath5 , stands for the purely mesonic potential contribution and is a function of two condensates , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the second part , @xmath8 , is the quark contribution and depends on the two condensates as well as on the external parameters temperature @xmath1 and , for simplicity , only one quark chemical potential @xmath2 . since the quark contribution arises from a momentum - loop integration over the quark fields , it is given by an integral which can not be evaluated in closed form analytically .",

    "it is just a function of the two condensates and reads @xmath21 wherein all remaining quantities , e.g.  @xmath22 are constant parameters .    since the physical condensates , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",

    "( [ eq : quark_pot ] ) and simultaneously the eom have to be solved numerically .",
    "this already is an example suitable for an ad application , because a derivative of a only numerically solvable , implicit function is needed as input .",
    "later we will be interested in higher - order derivatives of the grand potential with respect to , e.g. , the chemical potential .",
    "for example , the quark number density at the physical point is defined by @xmath29 in cases without an implicit @xmath1- or @xmath2-dependence in the thermodynamic potential some progress can be made by calculating the corresponding derivatives explicitly and solving the corresponding equations numerically .",
    "this might be feasible for lower - order derivatives , in particular , if parts of the derivative calculations can be performed by some computer algebra packages like mathematica or maple .",
    "but for higher - order derivatives this procedure is error - prone and time - consuming and not applicable anymore .    in the following sections the algorithmic differentiation technique for implicitly defined functions",
    "is introduced on a general mathematical level .",
    "suppose the function @xmath30 , @xmath31 describing an arbitrary algebraic mapping from @xmath32 to @xmath33 is defined by an evaluation procedure in a high - level computer language like fortran or c. the technique of algorithmic differentiation provides derivative information of arbitrary order for the code segment in the computer that evaluates @xmath34 within working accuracy .",
    "for this purpose , the basic differentiation rules such as , e.g. , the product rule are applied to each statement of the given code segment .",
    "this local derivative information is then combined by the chain rule to calculate the overall derivatives .",
    "hence the code is decomposed into a long sequence of simple evaluations , e.g. ,  additions , multiplications , and calls to elementary functions such as @xmath35 or @xmath36 , the derivatives of which can be easily calculated .",
    "exploiting the chain rule yields the derivatives of the whole sequence of statements with respect to the input variables .    as an example , consider the function @xmath37 with @xmath38 that can be evaluated by the pseudo - code given on the left column of tab .",

    "@xmath40    for the vector @xmath41 one obtains the first column of the jacobian @xmath42 the vector @xmath43 , @xmath44 . correspondingly , the other unit vectors in @xmath45 yield the other two remaining columns of the jacobian @xmath46 .",
    "table  [ fig1 ] illustrates the so - called forward mode of ad , where the derivatives are propagated together with the function evaluation .",
    "alternatively , one may propagate the derivative information from the dependents @xmath47 to the independents @xmath48 yielding the so - called reverse mode of ad .    over the past decades , extensive research activities led to a thorough understanding and analysis of these two basic modes of ad , where the complexity results with respect to the required runtime are based on the operation count @xmath49 ,  i.e. ,  the number of floating point operations required to evaluate @xmath50 , and the degree @xmath51 of the computed derivatives . using the forward mode , one computes the required derivatives together with the function evaluation in one sweep as illustrated above .",
    "the forward mode yields one _ column _ of the jacobian @xmath52 at no more than three times @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "one _ row _ of @xmath52 , e.g. , the gradient of a scalar - valued component function of @xmath53 , is obtained using the reverse mode in its basic form also at no more than four times @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that this bound for the reverse mode is completely independent of the number @xmath54 of input variables .",
    "this observation is called _ cheap gradient result_.    for the application discussed in the present work , the forward mode has been chosen for the efficient computation of higher - order derivatives which is illustrated in the following paragraphs . to this end",

    "the vector polynomial @xmath56 describes a path in @xmath57 which is parameterized by @xmath58 .",

    "one obtains for the taylor coefficients @xmath72 the derivative expressions @xmath73 hence , the overall complexity grows rapidly with the degree @xmath51 of the taylor polynomial . to avoid these prohibitively expensive calculations the standard higher - order forward sweep of algorithmic differentiation is based on taylor arithmetic @xcite yielding an effort that grows like @xmath74 times the cost of evaluating @xmath75 .",
    "this is quite obvious for arithmetic operations such as multiplications or additions , where one obtains the recursion shown in table  [ tab : arith ] ,    .taylor coefficient propagation for arithmetic operations [ cols=\"^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     similar formulas can be found for all intrinsic functions .",

    "@xmath202 + \\mathcal{o}(h^{4 } ) \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] are itemized .",
    "the grid points are given by @xmath203 for completeness the fourth - order derivative is quoted @xmath204 + \\mathcal{o}(h^{4})\\ .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where at least five grid points are needed for its calculation .",
    "the disadvantage of such type of improvements is that the function has to be evaluated at several different grid points @xmath200 which are located in the vicinity of @xmath190 .",
    "the other error source , the rounding error , depends on the used format of the floating point number representation in the computer .",
    "a single precision ieee floating point number is stored in a 32-bit word , where 8 bits are used for the biased exponent and the fractional part of the normalized mantissa is a 23-bits binary number .",
    "one bit in the ieee format is always reserved for the sign of the number .",
    "a double precision number occupies 64 bits , with the biased exponent stored in 11 bits and the fractional part is stored on the remaining 52 bits .",
    "thus , besides the fact that one can represent only a finite subset of all real numbers , all floating point calculations are furthermore rounded resulting in incorrect values .",
    "the smallest positive number @xmath205 , where the floating point approximation for @xmath206 is indeed larger than one is called the machine precision .",
    "when one rounds to the nearest representable number the machine precision is roughly @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the number of bits used to store the mantissa s fraction . for a single precision representation one finds @xmath209 and for a double precision number calculation @xmath210 .",
    "this means that single precision numbers have at most about 7 accurate digits while double precision numbers have about 16 accurate digits .",
    "but in general , due to the error propagation during the application of approximate algorithms the number of accurate digits for a numerical solution decreases .",
    "therefore , the rounding error will be several orders of magnitude larger for a more complicated calculation such as the one for the thermodynamic potential . to minimize this source of error in the derivative calculation of the thermodynamic potential",
    ", a larger value of @xmath193 is reasonable .    in order to estimate these numerical errors and verify the quality of the adol - cevaluations the results of the derivative calculation obtained with ad",
    "are confronted with the dd method .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : advsnum_t0 ] and [ fig : advsnum_cep ] the results of a dd evaluation as a function of @xmath193 in comparison with the ad calculation for the second - order and fourth - order derivative of the thermodynamic potential are shown .",
    "[ fig : advsnum_t0 ] shows the @xmath2-derivatives of the potential evaluated at @xmath211 mev which is close to the crossover phase transition in the @xmath186 phase diagram .",
    "one can clearly see the competition of the truncation and rounding errors . for the second - order derivative",
    "the optimal value is around @xmath212 while for the fourth - order derivative a slightly larger value @xmath213 leads to more stable results . in fig .",
    "[ fig : advsnum_cep ] the same derivatives are calculated at the point @xmath214 mev which is near the critical end point in the phase diagram . while in the previous fig .",
    "[ fig : advsnum_t0 ] the rounding error dominates , the truncation error is now more important . for the second - order derivative almost no rounding error is visible in the resolution shown . since the truncation error for the five - point expression , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2nd_five ] ) , is of the order @xmath215 and of the order @xmath216 for the corresponding three - point equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2nd_three ] ) , the results of the five - point derivative is indistinguishable already for @xmath213 while for the three - point formula a smaller value of @xmath217 is required . for the fourth - order derivative the interval where the derivative does not vary with @xmath193",
    "is very small . only for @xmath218",
    "the dd result is close to the ad result .    in summary",
    ", one realizes that the dd derivatives require a very careful fine - tuning of the @xmath193 value .",
    "the dd result coincides always with the dd results where the @xmath193 variation vanishes .",
    "one finds that the ad technique is more efficient than the dd method .",
    "the dd calculation always requires the evaluation of the function at several points , e.g. , for the fourth derivative five function evaluations are necessary . in our case",
    "this involves the solution of the eom at these five nodes .",
    "this is a time - consuming disadvantage of the dd method . with the ad",
    "the eom need to be solved only once . despite the fact that it is required to generate an internal function representation of the evaluation of the eom solution and of the thermodynamic potential inside of adol - c ,",
    "the ad implementation is much faster .",
    "corresponding runtime measurements are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwad_runtime ] .        the runtime of the dd approach can be described by the linear function @xmath219 where as the ad runtime performs like @xmath220 .",
    "this result fits perfectly to the computational complexity of the ad approach described in sec .",
    "[ sub:4.3 ] .",
    "as previously illustrated , both error sources for a derivative calculation with the dd method are in general difficult to keep under control , in particular , if higher - order derivatives are involved . however , with the ad method it is possible to obtain higher - order derivatives with very high precision . in the following an explicit example",
    "is given within the already introduced linear sigma model .",
    "higher derivatives are required if one is interested , e.g. , in the extrapolation of monte carlo lattice simulations of strongly interacting matter ( lattice gauge theory ) to finite quark chemical potential . at finite quark chemical potential such types of monte carlo simulations",
    "can not be directly performed  @xcite .",
    "one possible extrapolation to finite quark chemical potential is based on a taylor expansion around zero chemical potential  @xcite .    for this purpose",
    ", we consider the same kind of expansion in the quark - meson system described by the l@xmath0 m .",
    "an example is given by the coefficients in the expansion of the pressure @xmath221 which is related to the thermodynamic potential via @xmath222 at fixed temperature and small values of the quark chemical potential the pressure may be expanded in a taylor series around @xmath223 , @xmath224 where the expansion coefficients are given in terms of derivatives of the pressure @xmath225 the series is even in @xmath226 which reflects the invariance of the partition function under the exchange of particles and antiparticles .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : adtaylor ] the expansion coefficients @xmath227 to @xmath228 are shown as function of the scaled temperature @xmath229 . here , @xmath230 is the pseudocritical temperature at which the crossover transition occurs for vanishing chemical potential .",
    "since the first three expansion coefficients @xmath231 and @xmath232 are already known and well - understood we do not show them again  @xcite . in lattice gauge theory one",
    "can currently calculate the first five coefficients , @xmath233  @xcite .",
    "the higher coefficients @xmath234 with @xmath235 vanish for temperatures basically outside of a five percent window around @xmath230 .",
    "thus , all coefficients are only shown in the range @xmath236 .",
    "all curves are smooth oscillating functions around zero even up to the @xmath237 derivative order .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation and the number of roots around @xmath230 increases with the order @xmath54 .",
    "thus , this oscillating behavior of the coefficients obviously requires a smaller @xmath193 in order to decrease the truncation error but then the rounding error increases . already in this example",
    "the error sources are dramatic for such a high degree of derivatives .",
    "therefore it is not reasonable and actually not possible to obtain the higher coefficients with standard techniques such as the dd method .",
    "a novel numerical technique , which is based on algorithmic differentiation , for the calculation of arbitrarily high - order and high - precision derivatives has been presented .",
    "the new feature of the technique is the additional treatment of implicitly defined functions .",
    "in addition , the basic concepts of the algorithmic differentiation for explicit dependencies is discussed .    as a demonstration of the successful extension to implicitly defined functions",
    "the ad technique is applied to a quantum - field theoretical model for strongly - interacting matter . in this model",
    "the implicitly defined functions are represented by the underlying equations of motion where the implicitly defined order parameter is known only numerically .",
    "two important error sources namely , the rounding and truncation error , for a derivative calculation in general are discussed in detail . furthermore , the results with the improved ad method are confronted to those obtained by standard divided difference ( dd ) methods . in the comparison",
    "the rounding and truncation errors can clearly be identified . while for a second - order derivative calculation the error sources are still controllable , they become intractable for higher orders .    in the model example",
    "higher - order derivative coefficients of a taylor expansion for the pressure are calculated up to @xmath237 order .",
    "since these coefficients are calculated for the first time , no comparison with other results can be performed .",
    "the obtained curves are very stable and smooth functions which demonstrates the power of the novel ad technique . in a forthcoming publication",
    "@xcite this method will be applied to the more realistic polyakov - quark - meson model for three quark flavors @xcite .",
    "the presented ad technique augmented by implicitly defined dependencies can be applied to a wide class of problems , where high - order derivatives are involved .",
    "standard alternative methods for the derivative calculation such as the dd method fail due to uncontrollably increasing errors .",
    "especially , in the case of only numerically known implicit dependencies , an analytic solution is actually not possible . here , the ad method is still applicable and displays its exceptional impact .",
