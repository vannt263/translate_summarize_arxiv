    "scattering of waves in disordered media has proved to be a nontrivial topic possessing intriguing and still not completely understood features.@xcite accordingly to the strength of disorder , one observes a variety of propagation regimes ranging from ballistic transport , through single scattering and wave diffusion , to the anderson localization . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the regime of wave diffusion , corresponding to a relatively strong disorder , which is , however , still largely insufficient to bring the system to the localization transition ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a wave number in the medium , and @xmath2 is a mean free path ) .",
    "it is well - known , that multiple scattering of coherent wave in a disordered medium results in a complicated spatial intensity distribution @xmath3 known as a `` speckle pattern '' .",
    "the speckle pattern is highly irregular and appears random to the eye .",
    "it is now well established that the speckle pattern exhibits large intensity fluctuations@xcite @xmath4 , originating from the interference of partial waves arriving at @xmath5 with completely randomized phases . here",
    "the angular brackets @xmath6 denote ensemble averaging , and @xmath7 . besides , the speckle pattern possesses nontrivial long - range spatial correlation @xmath8 even for @xmath9 .",
    "this correlation is due to interaction of diffusing modes.@xcite if the points @xmath10 are far enough from the boundaries of the medium , @xmath11 .",
    "recently , it has been shown that in a particular case of a point source of waves embedded inside a disordered medium , there exists an infinite - range contribution to @xmath12 originating from scattering events taking place in the immediate neighborhood of the source.@xcite this contribution is highly sensitive to the short - distance properties of disorder , as well as to the source size and shape.@xcite    if the scatterers in the medium are allowed to move , @xmath3 fluctuates with time , and the statistics of these fluctuations is also a subject of active research .",
    "a wave propagating in a disordered , multiple - scattering medium undergoes a large number of scattering events , and hence the scattered intensity is highly sensitive to displacements of scatterers.@xcite consequently , the decay of the intensity autocorrelation function @xmath13 is considerably faster than in the single - scattering case.@xcite recently , long - range autocorrelation function of intensity fluctuations has been measured,@xcite and the existence of the universal conductance fluctuations ( analogous to that in disordered conductors ) has been demonstrated@xcite for optical waves .",
    "theoretical analysis of the temporal correlation function of multiple - scattered waves has been extended to amplifying disordered media,@xcite as well as to the case of intense incident waves producing flows of scatterers in the disordered medium.@xcite an additional contribution to @xmath14 , originating from scattering in the immediate neighborhood of source and/or detector , decaying much slower than all the previously known contributions , is predicted to exist.@xcite    high sensitivity of multiple - scattering speckle patterns to scatterer motion gave rise to a new technique for studying the scatterer dynamics in disordered , turbid media , the so - called `` diffusing - wave spectroscopy '' ( dws).@xcite the latter is now widely applied in concentrated colloidal suspensions,@xcite foams,@xcite emulsions,@xcite granular@xcite and biological@xcite media . besides , the dws has been extended to macroscopically heterogeneous turbid media , providing a tool for imaging of dynamic heterogeneities@xcite and visualization of scatterer flows@xcite in the bulk of the medium .",
    "a generalization of dws technique has been also accomplished for anisotropic disordered media.@xcite recently , the dws approach has been extended to nonergodic turbid media.@xcite    the above - mentioned , extensive studies of temporal fluctuations of multiple - scattered waves , as well as the numerous application of dws , are all restricted to _ linear _ disordered media . in general , little information is available on the subject of multiple scattering in _ nonlinear _ disordered media .",
    "meanwhile , the question concerning the way in which the nonlinearity affects the multiple - scattering speckle pattern still remains open and continue to attract the researches .",
    "considerable efforts have been made to understand the phenomena of coherent backscattering in disordered media with kerr - type nonlinearity:@xcite a narrow dip has been predicted to appear on the top of the backscattering peak .",
    "weak localization effects are shown to exist in the radiation of second harmonic and difference frequency,@xcite though their experimental observation failed.@xcite also studied with account for disorder is the optical phase conjugation.@xcite more recently , correlations in transmission and reflection coefficients of second harmonic waves have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally,@xcite and the angular correlation functions of fundamental wave in a disordered medium with kerr - type nonlinearity have been calculated.@xcite despite the fact that theoretical description of wave scattering in nonlinear media is complicated by the simultaneous presence of both disorder and nonlinearity , the standard diagram technique for impurity scattering has been extended to the case of disordered medium with nonlinearity of kerr type.@xcite    very recently , it has been shown that the speckle pattern resulting from the multiple scattering of coherent wave in a _ nonlinear _ disordered medium with kerr - type nonlinearity , should be extremely sensitive to changes of scattering potential,@xcite i.e. much more sensitive than the _ linear _ speckle pattern . this high sensitivity has been explained by the multiplicity of solutions of nonlinear wave equation.@xcite the multiplicity of solutions has been then shown to lead to the temporal _ instability _ of the multiple - scattering speckle pattern in nonlinear medium , resulting in _ spontaneous _ fluctuations of scattered wave with time.@xcite an important prediction of ref .",
    "is that the nonlinearity should exceed some threshold value for the instability to develop .",
    "the threshold value is principally determined by the absorption length @xmath15 , or by the sample size @xmath16 , if @xmath17 .",
    "the striking feature of the established result is that the threshold value of nonlinearity tends to zero in an unbounded medium without absorption .",
    "purely elastic , unbounded nonlinear multiple - scattering systems are therefore always unstable .",
    "the physical origin of the instability is easy to understand.@xcite nonlinearity modifies the phases of partial waves propagating in the medium .",
    "the phase modifications are proportional to the intensity @xmath3 and affect the mutual interference of partial waves . as it is this interference which is responsible for @xmath3 , a sort of feedback establishes in the medium .",
    "a small modification of @xmath3 causes modifications of phases of partial waves which , in their turn , produce changes of @xmath3 , and so on .",
    "it is well - known that nonlinear wave systems with sufficiently strong , positive feedback may become unstable.@xcite as an example , we cite a family of nonlinear optical systems with two - dimensional feedback,@xcite where spontaneous formation of complicated spatial structures is observed . despite the absence of disorder , such systems exhibit transition to seemingly chaotic dynamics with increasing nonlinearity.@xcite an analogy can be drawn between the nonlinear optical systems with two - dimensional feedback and nonlinear disordered media by considering the scattering as a ( three - dimensional ) feedback mechanism . in the case of disordered media , however , the feedback is of random nature and it is therefore hopeless to expect regular spatial structures to form .",
    "meanwhile , the instability can manifest itself in spontaneous fluctuations of speckle pattern . in order to clarify the issue of instability of speckle patterns in nonlinear disordered media",
    ", we consider the following questions :    * can the multiple scattering provide a positive feedback mechanism for waves propagating in a nonlinear disordered medium ? *",
    "if `` yes '' , how strong the nonlinearity should be for the instability to develop ?    a general announcement of our principal answers to the above questions has been given in our recent letter.@xcite in the present paper , we discuss and justify the assumptions and approximations underlying our conclusions , provide the missing details of calculations , and give a comprehensive discussion of results . also developed and discussed",
    "is the perturbation approach to the calculation of the temporal autocorrelation function of multiple - scattered wave in a nonlinear disordered medium .",
    "it is important that the validity condition of the perturbation theory coincides with the condition for the instability threshold as obtained by using the self - consistent approach .",
    "in addition , we give a detailed consideration to an experimentally important case of moving scatterers , when the decrease of the time autocorrelation function is due to a combined effect of spontaneous and scatterer - motion - induced fluctuations of the speckle pattern .",
    "the remainder of the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",

    "[ dephasing ] , we present a calculation of dephasing of waves in a nonlinear disordered medium .",
    "our calculation takes into account the fluctuations of the local refractive index due to nonlinear effects , as well as the long - range spatial correlation of this fluctuations .",
