    "a general goal in atomic and molecular physics is to quantitatively predict quantum dynamics from knowledge of the system hamiltonian .",
    "however , sufficiently accurate information about these hamiltonians is still lacking for many applications .",
    "although the capabilities of _ ab initio _ methods are improving , they remain unable to provide the quantitative accuracy needed to predict many quantum dynamical phenomena and data inversion remains the most reliable source of precision information about quantum hamiltonians .",
    "but , traditional data inversion techniques are hindered by the fact that ( a ) spectroscopic and collision data only provide information about limited portions of the the desired interactions and ( b ) the relationships between quantum hamiltonians and their corresponding observables are generally nonlinear @xcite .",
    "the recently proposed optimal identification ( oi ) @xcite procedure provides a new approach to quantum system hamiltonian identification through laboratory data inversion .",
    "the operating principle behind oi is to improve the information content of the data by driving the quantum system using a tailored control field ( e.g. , a shaped laser pulse ) .",
    "if suitably chosen , the control field forces the data to become highly sensitive to otherwise inaccessible portions of the hamiltonian and therefore enables a high fidelity inversion .",
    "a key component of the oi concept exploits the fact that the inversion will generally produce a family , or distribution , of hamiltonians that are consistent with the laboratory data @xcite .",
    "the breadth of this inversion family provides a figure of merit for the quality of the inversion .",
    "the limiting experimental factors that prevent the inverted family of hamiltonians from collapsing down to a single ( i.e. , completely certain ) member arise from two sources . first , the finite precision of the data reduces the resolving power of the measurements and makes it possible for multiple hamiltonians to be consistent with the data to within its experimental error .",
    "second , hamiltonians that differ in ways for which the data is insensitive also reduces the inversion quality .",
    "oi operates by attempting to drive the quantum system into a dynamical state where the associated experimental errors are least compromising , yet where the measurements provide distinguishing power between hamiltonians to narrow down the family consistent with the data .",
    "as originally formulated , the oi algorithm requires performing a large number of global , nonlinear data inversions , each of which can be computationally expensive @xcite . resolving the members of the inversion family consistent with the data might require extracting hundreds of distinct hamiltonians involving numerous solutions of the schrdinger equation . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that it is possible to greatly reduce the computational challenge of performing oi by incorporating map - facilitated inversion techniques@xcite that have been specifically developed for efficiently finding these solution families .",
    "a map is a predetermined quantitative input@xmath0output relationship which can alleviate the expense of repeatedly solving the schrdinger equation @xcite .",

    "the principal behind the oi algorithm is to optimize an external control field that drives the system in a manner similar to the learning - loop techniques utilized in many current coherent quantum control experiments .",
    "the distinction between oi and the latter control experiments lies in the optimization target : oi is guided to optimize the extracted hamiltonian information .",

    "inversion is performed by adopting a discrete set of variables , @xmath11 used to distinguish one trial hamiltonian from another .",
    "there are many possible ways to define these hamiltonian variables , and the best representation must be selected to suit the quantum system being inverted , but in general , a sufficiently flexible and accurate description of hamiltonian space requires a large number of variables , @xmath12 .",
    "inversion is accomplished by minimizing ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) observable s computed value for the trial hamiltonian , @xmath17 , under the influence of the external field , @xmath18 .",
    "optionally , a regularization operator , @xmath19 , acting on the hamiltonian , @xmath17 , can be used to incorporate _ a priori _ behavior , such as smoothness , proper asymptotic behavior , symmetry , , into the inverted hamiltonian @xcite .",

    "although it is generally impossible to resolve @xmath47 on a full grid in @xmath43-space due to exponential sampling complexity in @xmath48 dimensions , it has been found @xcite that an accurate nonlinear map can often be constructed using the functional form , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a constant term , the functions , @xmath51 , dependent upon a single variable , @xmath52 , the functions @xmath53 depend upon two variables , @xmath52 and @xmath54 , .",
    "expansions of the form in belong to a family of multivariate representations used to capture the input@xmath0output relationships of many high - dimensional physical systems@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that converges to low order , @xmath55 for many hamiltonian@xmath0observable maps . a low order , converged map expansion can be truncated after its last significant order without sacrificing accuracy or nonlinearity which dramatically reduces the computational labor of constructing the map .",
    "the specifics for how the individual expansion functions should be evaluated can be found in previous papers@xcite .",
    "map - facilitated oi operates by replacing the step of explicitly computing @xmath42 in with the value @xmath46 obtained by evaluating the functional map in which serves as a high - speed replacement for solving the schrdinger equation . the map ( or potentially multiple maps if this is necessary to ensure sufficient accuracy @xcite ) must be constructed as a preliminary step prior to initiating the inversion optimization .",
    "since map construction requires knowledge of the control field , it may not be possible to pre - compute all of the maps prior to executing the full oi loop . instead , a new map will generally need to be constructed for each trial laser pulse .",
