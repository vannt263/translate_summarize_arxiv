    "the collective flow in heavy ion reactions in the intermediate and high energy region has been studied in these years both experimentally and theoretically with the expectation that it carries the information of hot and dense nuclear matter . however , by the study with microscopic simulation approaches such as vlasov - uehling - uhlenbeck ( vuu ) method , it has turned out that extracting the equation of state from the collective flow is not easy since it reflects not only the equation of state but also the cross section of the two - nucleon collision term which has theoretical ambiguity in the nuclear medium .    although the collective flow is a one - body observable , the most characteristic feature of intermediate energy heavy ion reactions is the fragment formation .",
    "recently the collective flow has become to be measured with the identification of charges and/or mass numbers of fragments @xcite .",
    "the large flow of fragments is observed compared to the flow of nucleons , which suggests that the flow of composite fragments carries the direct information of the equation of state ( or the mean field ) , while most nucleons are emitted by the hard stochastic collisions which erase the effect of the mean field .",
    "thus we can expect that the study of the fragment flow together with the nucleon flow may give us important information on the equation of state .    for the theoretical analysis of the flow of fragments , the model should be able to describe the dynamical fragment formation , and we use the antisymmetrized version of molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite which was constructed by incorporating the stochastic collision process into the fermionic molecular dynamics that describes the system with a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the amd can describe some quantum mechanical features such as the shell effect in the cross sections of the dynamical production of the fragments .",
    "since the flow of @xmath1 particles is important among the flows of various fragments , this ability of the amd to describe the large cross sections of the dynamical production of @xmath1 particles is a very advantageous property of the amd for the present study .",
    "furthermore , amd has an advantage that the calculation with finite - range effective interaction is as feasible as the calculation with zero - range effective interaction , and therefore the momentum dependence of the mean field , which is essential for the study of the equation of state , is automatically taken into the calculation .    in studying the collective flow",
    ", we should also pay attention to the momentum distribution of the produced fragments .",
    "namely , since the flow is known to be a very sensitive quantity to the various parameters in the theory , such dependence should be understood on the level of the momentum distribution .",
    "for example , some change of the equation of state and another change of the in - medium cross section may result in the same change of the flow value , but this does not mean that one must give up the determination of the equation of state by using heavy ion reactions . we still have chance that these two changes will result in the distinguishable changes of the momentum distribution of fragments .",
    "our framework amd is suitable for such study of the momentum distribution of fragments since there is no ambiguity in identifying the fragments . as we pointed out in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the dissipated component of the momentum distribution of fragments such as @xmath1 particles is sensitive to the in - medium cross section , while the flow angle is expected to be sensitive to the effective interaction .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the flow of nucleons and fragments for the reaction @xmath2 in the energy region 45 mev / nucleon @xmath3 150 mev / nucleon which includes the observed balance energy .",
    "after giving a brief explanation of our framework in sect .",
    "ii , we discuss in sect .",
    "iii the use of the finite range gogny force @xcite as the effective interaction which gives the soft equation of state with the incompressibility of the nuclear matter @xmath4 mev .",
    "it is shown that the gogny force reproduces binding energies of light nuclei relevant to the present study . in sect .",
    "iv , before showing the calculated results of the flow , we will check the validity of our calculation by comparing the proton spectra with the data and the results of other calculations . in sect .",
    "v , the calculated results of the flow are shown and it will turn out that the soft equation of state with the gogny force is consistent to the experimentally observed balance energy of the flow .",
    "the calculated flow of @xmath1 particles is larger than the flow of nucleons , which is also consistent to the feature of the experimental data , and the mechanism of the creation of these flows will be revealed by paying attention to the time scale of the reaction and dividing the collective flow into two components , i.e. , the flow of dynamically emitted nucleons and the flow of the nuclear matter . in sect .",
    "vi , the dependence of the flow on the in - medium cross section and the origin of this dependence are discussed .",
    "vii is devoted to the summary .",
    "since the framework of the antisymmetrized version of molecular dynamics ( amd ) was described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , here is shown only the outline of our framework .    in amd ,",
    "the wave function of @xmath5-nucleon system @xmath6 is described by a slater determinant @xmath7 ; @xmath8,\\quad     \\varphi_i=\\phi_{{\\bf z}_i}\\chi_{\\alpha_i},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 represents the spin - isospin label of @xmath10th single particle state , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the spin - isospin wave function .",
    "@xmath16 is the spatial wave function of @xmath10th single particle state which is a gaussian wave packet @xmath17,\\ ] ] where the width parameter @xmath18 is treated as time - independent in our model .",
    "we took @xmath19 @xmath20 in the calculation presented in this paper .",
    "the time developments of the centers of gaussian wave packets , @xmath21 , are determined by two processes .",
    "one is the time development determined by the time - dependent variational principle @xmath22 which leads to the equation of motion for @xmath23 .    the second process which determines the time development of the system is the stochastic collision process due to the residual interaction .",
    "we incorporate this process in the similar way to the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) by introducing the physical coordinates @xmath24 @xcite as @xmath25 where @xmath26 in addition to the usual two nucleon collision process , the stochastic nucleon - alpha collision process is also included as in ref.@xcite .",
    "since we apply amd to the reactions with higher incident energy in this paper than in the previous works @xcite , the cross sections and the angular distributions of the stochastic collisions are reparametrized as explained in the appendix b.    since in amd the center - of - mass motion of the fragment is described by the gaussian wave packet , we have to subtract from the amd hamiltonian @xmath27 the sum of the spurious zero - point energies of the fragments whose number changes in time .",
    "the prescription to deal with this problem which is a revised version of the previous prescription in refs .",
    "@xcite is explained in the appendix c.    the simulations of amd are truncated at a finite time ( 150 fm/@xmath28 in the calculation presented in this paper ) .",
    "the dynamical stage of the reaction has finished by this time and some excited fragments have been formed which will emit lighter particles with a long time scale .",
    "such statistical decays of the equilibrated fragments are calculated with a code of ref .",
    "@xcite which is similar to the code of phlhofer @xcite .",
    "since the collective flow is expected to reflect the momentum dependence and the density dependence of the mean field , the choice of the effective interaction in our framework is important .",
    "the momentum dependence of the mean field can be taken into account as long as a finite range effective interaction is used , since the system is described with an antisymmetrized wave function in amd .",
    "the calculation with a finite range force is as feasible as the calculation with a zero - range force in amd , and therefore we have been using finite range effective interactions . in refs.@xcite we used the volkov force no .",
    "1 @xcite with the majorana parameter @xmath29 , which is a density - independent two - range interaction . by adjusting the parameter related to the subtraction of the spurious zero - point oscillation of fragments ,",
    "the binding energies of nuclei lighter than @xmath30 are reproduced very well .",
    "however , heavier nuclei are overbinding with this effective interaction as shown in fig .",
    "[ figbindingenergies ] .",
    "when the volkov force is applied , usually its majorana parameter @xmath31 should be chosen depending on the mass number of the nuclei under consideration , which makes the volkov force very inconvenient for our study .    in order to reproduce the binding energies of nuclei in wide mass number region within a single effective interaction , and in order to cope duely with the formation of the high density nuclear matter in collisions with high incident energy around and above 100 mev / nucleon",
    ", the density dependence of the effective interaction should be introduced .",
    "we use the gogny force @xcite in the calculation presented in this paper .",
    "the binding energies of nuclei lighter than @xmath32 are reproduced ( fig .",
    "[ figbindingenergies ] ) by adjusting the parameter related to the subtraction of the spurious zero - point oscillation of fragments which is described in the appendix c. it is known that the gogny force can describe the saturation property of nuclear matter with the incompressibility @xmath4 mev .",
    "the momentum dependence of the mean field with the gogny force is reliable below 200 mev , since the energy dependence of the real part of the nucleon optical potential is reproduced in this energy range .",
    "the gogny force has ever been successfully applied to the problem of the flow in the framework of vuu @xcite .",
    "the calculation with density dependent zero - range force requires us to evaluate the quantities such as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the density calculated with the amd wave function .",
    "this spatial integration was performed by a kind of monte carlo method with test particles generated randomly with a weight function .",
    "the detail of the calculation method is explained in the appendix a. if we use @xmath35 test particles , the statistical error in the evaluation of the energy of @xmath36 ground state is about 2 mev , which seems sufficiently small for the current purpose .",
    "before going into the problem of the collective flow , we compare our results on the proton energy spectrum to the data in the reaction @xmath37 reaction at the incident energy 84 mev / nucleon , which was also analyzed by other simulation methods such as vuu and qmd @xcite .",
    "it is for the purpose of showing the reliability of the amd calculation in the incident energy region around 100 mev / nucleon . as mentioned before @xcite",
    ", the amd has proved to be very successful in reproducing the nuclide distribution and the fragment energy spectra in the incident energy region around the fermi energy .    in fig .",
    "[ figprotonspectrum ] , the calculated proton energy spectra for various angles are compared to the data @xcite .",
    "the dotted histograms are the calculated proton spectra at the end of amd simulation @xmath38 fm/@xmath28 , which do not contain the contribution from the statistical decay of excited fragments after @xmath38 fm/@xmath28 , while the solid histograms are the final results which should be compared to the data .",
    "we can see the effect of the statistical decay of fragments on these spectra is not so large except for the low energy part . although our calculation has tendency to overestimate the proton spectra at @xmath39@xmath40 , this feature and the degree of the overestimation are common with other simulation approaches such as vuu and qmd @xcite .",
    "the spectra of backward angles are reproduced by our model as well as by qmd . in fig .",
    "[ figmultnuc ] , the multiplicity of nucleons are shown as a function of the impact parameter . the dynamical contribution before the statistical decay is shown as well as the final multiplicity .",
    "this result is again quite similar to those of qmd and vuu @xcite for all the impact parameter region .    in calculating the spectra in our model",
    ", we must attribute some widths to the momenta of nucleons and fragments produced in the amd calculation , since these momenta are central values of gaussian wave packets .",
    "each wave packet has the width @xmath41 in the momentum per nucleon where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the mass number of the fragment .",
    "however , we should not always take this width to have physical meaning , since some part of this width comes from the unphysical width of the projectile or the target in the initial state of the simulation .",
    "it seems reasonable to consider that such unphysical contribution mainly goes to the momentum widths of fragments and to assume that all the widths of the wave packets of nucleons are physical .",
    "when the proton spectra in fig.[figprotonspectrum ] are calculated , we neglect the widths of the fragments produced dynamically in the amd simulation , but attribute the widths to the dynamically produced nucleons in the amd simulation .",
    "although the definition of the flow is somewhat complicated in the experimental situation where the determination of the reaction plane is not trivial , we simply define here the flow of fragments with mass number @xmath43 as the mean in - plane transverse momentum , @xmath44 where @xmath45 if @xmath46 and @xmath47 if @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are the components of the in - plane momentum of the fragment in the center - of - mass system which are perpendicular to and along with the beam direction respectively .",
    "negative flow corresponds to the attractive interaction between the projectile and the target .",
    "this definition of the flow was already used in ref .",
    "@xcite and has almost no uncertainty due to the interpretation of the momentum width of the wave packets discussed in the previous section .",
    "another definition of the flow as the slope of @xmath51-@xmath50 curve is of course possible , but we have checked that the qualitative features to be discussed below does not change .",
    "the statistical precision of the flow defined by eq.([eqdefflow ] ) is better than the latter one .",
    "[ figfloweng ] shows the energy dependence of the calculated flows of nucleons and @xmath1 particles . in this figure , as well as in all the results",
    "hereafter , the impact parameter of the reaction is fixed to be 2 fm in order to improve the statistical precision .",
    "we can see that the calculated flows of nucleons and @xmath1 particles change their sign at the balance energy @xmath52 mev , though the balance energy of @xmath1 particles seems to be larger than that of nucleons .",
    "this calculated balance energy is not different so much from the experimentally deduced value @xmath53 mev / nucleon @xcite . on the other hand , in the calculation with the volkov force ,",
    "the flows of nucleons and @xmath1 particles are negative even at the incident energy 150 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "( in this calculation , another version of the stochastic collision process adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite was used . )    a remarkable feature is that the absolute value of the flow of @xmath1 particles is much larger than that of nucleons in the energy region @xmath54 .",
    "the reason of this larger flow of fragments becomes clear by distinguishing nucleons and fragments according to the time they are produced . from fig .",
    "[ figdndt ] which shows the distribution of the emission time of nucleons , we can see that the dynamical stage of the reaction has already finished at @xmath38 fm/@xmath28 .",
    "[ figflowengdynevap ] shows the flows at @xmath38 fm/@xmath28 ( dynamical ) and the flows of nucleons and @xmath1 particles which are produced by the statistical decay of other fragments after @xmath38 fm/@xmath28 ( evaporation ) .",
    "although the ` dynamical ' flows in the figure contain some contribution from the equilibrated stage of the reaction , we can see clear deference between the flow of dynamically emitted nucleons and the flow of evaporated nucleons from the equilibrated fragments .",
    "the negative flow of the evaporated nucleons is much larger than the flow of the dynamically emitted nucleons , and the final result is between them . since larger number of nucleons",
    "are emitted in the dynamical stage , as can be seen from fig.[figmulteng ] , the final result is closer to the flow of the dynamically emitted nucleons . on the other hand , the flow of @xmath1 particles seems to be almost independent of the time they are produced , and the value of the flow is close to the flow of the evaporated nucleons .",
    "these results lead us almost uniquely to the following interpretation .",
    "we can separate the collective flow into two components .",
    "the first one is the flow of the nucleons which are emitted by the hard stochastic collisions in the dynamical stage of the reaction . since the stochastic collision erases the memory of the mean field which the nucleon has been feeling before it is scattered , the absolute value of the negative flow is small .",
    "there may be another geometrical reason for this small flow that the projectile and the target prevent the nucleons with negative flow from going out to the free space more than the nucleons with positive flow .",
    "the second component of the collective flow is the flow of the nuclear matter which contributes to the flows of composite fragments produced in the dynamical stage of the reaction .",
    "this component has been affected directly by the mean field and the absolute value of the negative flow is large .",
    "the flows of evaporated nucleons and fragments inherit the flow of the parent fragments and hence they have the large value similar to the original nuclear matter flow .",
    "since the stochastic collision cross sections have some theoretical uncertainty , we should investigate the dependence of the flow on them .",
    "furthermore the study of such @xmath55-dependence of the momentum distribution will give us the way to determine the in - medium cross sections .",
    "[ figflowsig ] and [ figflowsig2 ] show the @xmath55-dependence of the flows of nucleons and @xmath1 particles at the incident energy 45 mev / nucleon and 110 mev / nucleon , respectively , when all the cross sections ( see appendix b ) are multiplied by 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.5 .",
    "the flows of the dynamically produced particles and the flows of the particles produced by the statistical decay are shown together with the final results .",
    "the flow of the dynamically emitted nucleons is almost independent of the cross sections .",
    "the multiplicity of dynamically emitted nucleons in the reaction at 45 mev / nucleon is 2.00 , 3.52 and 4.95 for @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "these results are consistent with the interpretation in the previous section because what is important to the flow of the dynamically emitted nucleons is that the emitted nucleons are direct products of the stochastic collisions and the number of such nucleons is not relevant to the value of the flow .    on the other hand , the @xmath55-dependence of the flow of the nuclear matter is large , especially in the reaction at 45 mev / nucleon , and the absolute value of the negative flow is smaller for larger cross sections .",
    "this might sound inconsistent to the naive expectation from the previous interpretation that the flow of the matter is essentially affected by the mean field .",
    "this @xmath55-dependence , however , turns out to be very reasonable when one pays attention to other features of the momentum distribution as well as the flow .",
    "figs.[figmomdistdyn ] and [ figmomdistevap ] show the in - plane momentum distribution of nucleons and @xmath1 particles which are calculated at @xmath38 fm/@xmath28 ( dynamical ) and from those produced by the statistical decay process ( evaporation ) , respectively .",
    "results for three cross sections @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are shown for the reaction at 45 mev / nucleon .",
    "the momentum distribution of dynamically emitted nucleons is almost spherical while the other three momentum distributions ( of evaporated nucleons , dynamical @xmath1 particles , and evaporated @xmath1 particles ) have the common @xmath55-dependence though the momentum distribution of the evaporated nucleons has wider spreading compared to that of @xmath1 particles . as the cross sections are increased , the dissipated component of the momentum distribution around the center - of - mass momentum increases while the flow angle does not change .",
    "what has changed the flow value of the matter is nothing but this @xmath55-dependence of the dissipated component of the momentum distribution .",
    "it is to be noted here that the @xmath55-dependence of the flow is not due to the specific definition of the flow ( [ eqdefflow ] ) .",
    "for example , if we adopt the definition of the flow as the slope of @xmath59-@xmath50 curve at @xmath60 , we get the @xmath55-dependence of the nucleon flow shown in fig.[figflow2sig ] which has the same qualitative feature as the left part of fig .",
    "[ figflowsig ] .",
    "in this paper the collective flow of fragments was calculated as well as the flow of nucleons with the amd for the reaction @xmath61 in the energy range 45 mev / nucleon @xmath3 150 mev / nucleon . the balance energy observed in the experiment",
    "was found to be consistent with the gogny force which yields a soft equation of state with @xmath4 mev .",
    "we obtained larger absolute value of the fragment flow than the nucleon flow , which is also consistent with the experimentally observed feature .",
    "the energy dependence and the @xmath55-dependence of the calculated flows of nucleons and fragments were found to be understandable , at least in the energy region where the flow is negative , by introducing the idea of two components of the collective flow .",
    "the first component is the flow of the dynamically emitted nucleons which are produced by stochastic collisions in the early stage of the reaction .",
    "since the stochastic collisions erase the effect of the mean field , the flow of the dynamically emitted nucleons is small .",
    "the second component is the flow of the nuclear matter which contributes to the flows of fragments produced during the dynamical stage of the reaction .",
    "the flows of the evaporated nucleons and fragments inherit the flow of the parent fragments and hence the flows of dynamical fragments and the evaporated nucleons and fragments have almost common magnitude and common energy dependence and @xmath55-dependence .",
    "although the second component is affected largely by the mean field , its @xmath55-dependence is also large .",
    "however , this @xmath55-dependence turned out to come not from the change of the flow angle but from change of the yield of the dissipated component in the momentum distribution of the fragments",
    ". detailed comparison of the fragment momentum distribution with the data will be able to settle the in - medium cross sections .",
    "on the other hand , nucleon momentum distribution is mainly governed by the dynamically emitted nucleons in this energy region , and therefore the shape of the momentum distribution is not so sensitive to the in - medium cross sections .",
    "we have mainly concentrated on the mechanism of the flow creation and the @xmath55-dependence in this paper , but the dependence on the effective interaction was not discussed in detail .",
    "what we have found is that the gogny force is sufficient for the reproduction of the balance energy while the volkov force fails . to calculate the flow with other effective interactions which reproduce the saturation property of the nuclear matter and have various incompressibilities is an important future problem for the determination of the equation of state of the nuclear matter .",

    "<S> the collective flow of nucleons and that of fragments in the @xmath0 reaction below 150 mev / nucleon are calculated with the antisymmetrized version of molecular dynamics combined with the statistical decay calculation . </S>",
    "<S> density dependent gogny force is used as the effective interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated balance energy is about 100 mev / nucleon , which is close to the observed value . below the balance energy , </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value of the fragment flow is larger than that of nucleon flow , which is also in accordance with data . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the flow on the stochastic collision cross section and its origin are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> all the results are naturally understood by introducing the concept of two components of flow : the flow of dynamically emitted nucleons and the flow of the nuclear matter which contributes to both the flow of fragments and the flow of nucleons due to the statistical decay . </S>"
