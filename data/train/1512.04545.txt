    "it has now been firmly established that the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics must be extended to include new particle(s ) to account for the observed dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "many of the proposed dark matter candidates fall into a broad category of _ thermal relics _ , particles which were in thermal equilibrium with the hot sm particle plasma at some point in the early universe , and subsequently  froze out \" as the universe expanded and cooled  @xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of this framework is its predictive power : the current abundance of the dm @xmath1 can be related to its microscopic properties , such as its mass and interaction cross sections .",
    "the type of interactions which determine the @xmath1 relic abundance can vary .",
    "the following three reactions will play a major role in the analysis of this paper :    * elastic scattering : @xmath1+sm @xmath2+sm , where  sm \" stands for any of the known standard model particles . *",
    "annihilation : @xmath3 sm+sm . * self - annihilation : @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "( specifically , we will focus on the case @xmath6 . )    in the popular weakly - coupled massive particle ( wimp ) paradigm , the relic abundance is entirely determined by the annihilation process .",
    "an alternative paradigm of self - interacting dark matter relies instead on self - annihilation  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the dark matter predicted by this scheme is too light ( @xmath7 ev ) to be consistent with the observed large - scale structure  @xcite .",
    "recently , an interesting variation has been proposed , dubbed the strongly interacting massive particle or simp  @xcite ( for extensions and variations , see @xcite ) . in this model",
    ", the relic abundance is still set by self - annihilation , but the elastic scattering process is strong enough to sustain the thermal equilibrium between the sm and dm sectors until freeze - out occurs . in this case , the dark matter mass consistent with cosmological data is between an mev and a gev . in these and all other known examples , the dm relic abundance is set by processes that change the @xmath1 particle number . in this letter , we present a novel scenario in which the dark matter relic density is determined almost exclusively by the decoupling of the _ elastic scattering_. we will refer to the dark matter candidate in this scenario as  elastically decoupling relic \" , or elder . in a nutshell ,",
    "the scenario works as follows . at high temperatures , when @xmath1 is relativistic , it is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with the sm plasma .",
    "as the universe cools to temperatures below the @xmath1 mass , the @xmath1 equilibrium density drops exponentially , and the annihilation process quickly decouples .",
    "( this feature is the same as in the simp scenario . )",
    "the self - annihilation and elastic scattering processes are still active , and maintain thermal and chemical equilibrium ( with zero chemical potential ) between the two sectors . in the elder scenario , the elastic scattering decouples _ first _ , while the self - annihilation process is still active .",
    "( this is in contrast to the simp case  @xcite , where the self - annihilation process is the first one to decouple . ) after the decoupling of elastic scattering , the dark matter sector enters the so - called  cannibalization \" epoch  @xcite , in which the energy released by self - annihilation keeps it at an approximately constant temperature , even as the universe continues to expand .",
    "eventually , the self - annihilation process also decouples , at which point the comoving number density of @xmath1 is frozen .",
    "the near - constant temperature ( and therefore density ) of the dm in the cannibalization epoch means that the relic abundance of dark matter observed today is almost entirely fixed by the density of @xmath1 s at the beginning of this epoch , which in turn is fixed by the size of the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "we study the scenario outlined above using both simple estimates and detailed numerical solutions of the boltzmann equations .",
    "we find that the observed dark matter abundance can be reproduced , and all theoretical and observational constraints can be satisfied , for @xmath1 masses between a few and a few hundred mev , while the cross - section of elastic scattering between dm and sm particles ( electrons , photons , and/or neutrinos ) is of the order of @xmath8 fb in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "dm candidates with such properties arise in simple and attractive theoretical extensions of the sm : for example , a hidden - sector dm can interact with the sm sector via a tev - scale @xmath9 with order - one gauge couplings to both sectors , or via a relatively light ( @xmath10 gev ) dark photon with a kinetic mixing parameter @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the thermal history of the elder is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : yield ] . at high temperatures ,",
    "when @xmath1 is relativistic , it maintains thermal and chemical equilibrium with the sm plasma .",
    "as the universe cools , the temperature drops below the @xmath1 mass , and the subsequent thermal history is marked by two important events . first is  decoupling \" , when the rate of elastic scattering becomes insufficient to maintain the dm and sm sectors in thermal contact .",
    "second is  freeze - out \" , at which point the rate of self - annihilation becomes insufficient to maintain chemical equilibrium in the dm sector , and the comoving dark matter density is frozen",
    ". between these two events , chemical equilibrium within the dm sector are still maintained by self - annihilations , but the dm temperature @xmath12 is no longer equal to the sm temperature @xmath13 . in this regime ,",
    "the dm gas undergoes  cannibalization \" : @xmath14 self - annihilations decrease the number density , but at the same time inject kinetic energy into the remaining gas . as the dm gas can not exchange entropy with the sm sector at this time ,",
    "its comoving entropy density is constant as the universe expands : a^3 s^_= a^3 = constant   + ( t^)^ 1/2 e^-m_/t^ t^3 where @xmath15 is the frw scale - factor . as a result",
    ", @xmath12 decreases much slower than @xmath13 as the universe expands : t^ , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is temperature at which ( elastic ) decoupling occurs . the comoving dm number density , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : yield ] , changes very slowly during the cannibalization regime .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the dm temperature at freeze - out .",
    "since the comoving entropies of the dm and sm sectors are separately conserved in the cannibalization epoch , the dm number density at freeze - out is given by n_f^= = = , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the entropy densities of the sm and dm sectors at decoupling , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the same quantities at freeze - out .",

    "these bounds would also be completely eliminated if @xmath1 couples only to neutrinos .",
    "if the elder decoupling occurs after the neutrinos are decoupled from the sm plasma , it can affect the temperature ratio @xmath76 , resulting in a non - standard value of @xmath69 measured in cmb observations .",
