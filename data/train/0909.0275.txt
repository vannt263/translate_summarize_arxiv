    "the same physics applies to type  ia supernovae , but because the radius of the progenitor white dwarf is so small ( @xmath4  cm ) the breakout emission should be extremely brief and the early luminosity remarkably dim .",
    "the problem is that when energy input occurs at small radii , adiabatic losses in the rapidly expanding ( @xmath5 ) ejecta are overwhelming , and the thermal shock deposited energy is converted to kinetic energy on the expansion timescale ( @xmath6  sec ) , which is much shorter than the diffusion timescale .    as it turns out , the separation distance between the white dwarf and its companion star is presumed to be @xmath7  cm , comparable to the radii of core collapse progenitors .",
    "when the supernova ejecta collides with its companion , the impacting layers are re - shocked and the kinetic energy partially dissipated .",
    "if the geometry is favorable , some of this energy might escape straightaway in a prompt burst , which will be followed by a longer - lasting tail of diffusive emission  the analogues of shock breakout and its aftermath in core collapse events . in this case",

    "<S> the progenitors of type  ia and some core collapse supernovae are thought to be stars in binary systems , but little observational evidence exists to confirm the hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the collision of the supernova ejecta with its companion star should produce detectable emission in the hours and days following the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction occurs at distances @xmath0  cm and shocks the impacting supernova debris , dissipating kinetic energy and re - heating the gas . </S>",
    "<S> initially , some radiation may escape promptly through the evacuated region of the shadowcone , producing a bright x - ray ( 0.1 - 2  kev ) burst lasting minutes to hours with luminosity @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> continuing radiative diffusion from deeper layers of shock heated ejecta produces a longer lasting optical / uv emission which exceeds the radioactively powered luminosity of the supernova for the first few days after the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> these signatures are prominent for viewing angles looking down upon the shocked region , or about 10% of the time . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the emission provide a straightforward measure of the separation distance between the stars and hence ( assuming roche lobe overflow ) the companion s radius . </S>",
    "<S> current optical and uv data sets likely already constrain red giant companions . by systematically acquiring early time data for many supernovae </S>",
    "<S> , it should eventually be possible to empirically determine how the parameters of the progenitor system influence the outcome of the explosion . </S>"
