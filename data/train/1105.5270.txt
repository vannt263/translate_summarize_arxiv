    "experiments have raised the issue of the relative stability of various fractional quantum hall states in graphene . the earliest results in suspended graphene in the two - terminal geometry @xcite gave indications of fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) at @xmath0 .",
    "the more recent experiments by dean _",
    "et al _ and ghahari _ et al _ @xcite in four - terminal hall bar geometry for graphene on boron nitride hexagonal substrate have revealed a much richer structure .",
    "specifically , they observe fqhe at filling factors @xmath1 and in the central ( @xmath2 ) landau level , and at @xmath3 in the @xmath4 landau level . in addition",
    ", they also see evidence fqhe at @xmath5 in the @xmath2 ll , but none at @xmath6 .",
    "hansel , lafkioti , and v. krsti have also reported 4/3 fqhe in a four - terminal geometry @xcite .",
    "more recently , feldman , krauss , smet and yacoby @xcite have observed incompressible states in suspended flakes in the sequence @xmath7 for all @xmath8 in the @xmath9 range , but only at @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the @xmath12 range .",
    "the difference of the @xmath13 and @xmath12 interval , and the absence of fqhe at @xmath14 in particular , remains a puzzle .",
    "our treatment below builds upon our understanding of the fqhe in gaas systems . in gaas systems ,",
    "the fqhe is associated with the formation of composite fermions ( cfs ) , bound states of electrons and an even number of quantized vortices @xcite . the electronic ll splits into landau - like levels of composite fermions , called @xmath15 levels ( @xmath15ls ) , and the integer quantum hall effect of composite fermions produces the prominently observed fqhe at @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the number of completely filled @xmath15 levels and @xmath18 is the number of vortices bound to electrons .",
    "the cf theory has been extended to include spin @xcite : with spin , fqhe occurs at the same fractions as before , namely @xmath16 , but now , in general , fqhe states with different spin polarizations are available at each fraction , analogous to the situation at integer fillings where different spin polarizations would occur depending on the strength of the zeeman splitting relative to the cyclotron energy .",
    "experiments have measured the transitions between differently polarized states , the actual spin polarizations of the states , cf @xmath15 level fan diagram , and the phase boundaries @xcite , which are all found to be in good agreement with the cf theory .",
    "( for the integer quantum hall effect , this physics is not relevant for gaas , because the zeeman energy is very small compared to the cyclotron energy , thus producing the state with the smallest spin polarization .",
    "however , for fqhe , the zeeman energy can be of the order of the effective cyclotron energy of composite fermions , and therefore many different spin polarization occur . )",
    "we note that some of the states were written down in an early work of halperin on multicomponent wave functions for the fqhe @xcite .",
    "the fqhe problem in graphene differs from that in gaas in two respects .",
    "first , in graphene , each electron has four - components , because of two spin projections and two valleys , producing an approximate su(4 ) symmetry when the zeeman energy and the valley splittings are negligible .",
    "second , the linear dispersion leads to an interaction that is in general different from that in gaas @xcite .",
    "our previous theoretical work on fqhe in graphene @xcite has shown that composite fermions are formed in both @xmath2 and @xmath4 lls .",
    "the fqhe is thus still predicted to occur at @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fractional part of the filling factor in ll @xmath21 , but , in general , many more kinds of incompressible states are now available at each fraction , depending on whether the system is in the su(2 ) limit or su(4 ) .",
    "the actual ground state is determined by a competition between the cf kinetic energy , which favors occupation of the lowest available @xmath15 levels , the cf exchange energy , which favors occupation of @xmath15 levels with the same su(4 ) index , and the zeeman and valley splittings @xcite .",
    "some of the observations on fqhe in graphene are consistent with theoretical expectations : ( i ) the observed fractions have the form @xmath22 as measured relative to a filled landau level .",
    "( ii ) the strength of fqhe in the @xmath4 ll is comparable to that in the @xmath23 ll , to be contrasted with gaas systems @xcite , where fqhe in the second ll is much weaker than that in the lowest ll .",
    "( iii ) as predicted in @xcite , no fqhe has been observed at even denominator fractions in the @xmath4 ll .",
    "some other observations are unexpected , however .",
    "noteworthy is the absence of fractions such as @xmath14 and @xmath24 , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are strong .",
    "also puzzling is the appearance of fqhe at 1/3 ; one would have expected @xmath14 to be stronger given that its reference state at @xmath27 does not require any spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath4 ll , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are both observed strongly .",
    "these fractions do not appear , at first sight , to be consistent with either su(2 ) or su(4 ) symmetry , thus posing a well defined puzzle whose resolution will shed important light on the nature of the fqhe in graphene .",
    "our aim in this paper is to determine the stability of various states by evaluating the gaps using the cf theory .",
    "the gaps in the su(2 ) limit were evaluated previously for states of the form @xmath30 for the lowest ll of gaas ( these results carry over to the @xmath2 landau level of graphene @xcite ) but not for the @xmath31 landau level of graphene .",
    "in addition , gaps for the reverse - flux attached states at @xmath32 have not been calculated for technical reasons .",
    "( lowest landau level projection , which is needed to obtain states appropriate for the high field limit , is prohibitively expensive for large systems for the latter class of states . )",
    "however , the reverse - flux attached states are relevant to the graphene problem because the observed @xmath33 fqhe state is of that form @xcite .",
    "we estimate below the gaps for the states relevant to the recent experiments .",
    "in addition , we obtain the collective mode dispersions for various graphene fqhe states in both the su(2 ) and su(4 ) limits .",
    "the issue of the @xmath34 state in graphene has been addressed recently in exact diagonalization studies @xcite .",
    "another approach for constructing fqhe states in the su(4 ) limit can be found in @xcite .",
    "a chern - simons treatment of composite fermions in the su(4 ) limit is given in @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . following necessary definitions in section [ model ] , we study the excitation structure of the su(2 ) limit in section [ su2limit ] and the su(4 ) limit in section [ su4limit ] .",
    "we discuss our results in light of the recent experiments @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "for electrons confined to a landau level , the kinetic energy is quenched , and we need to consider the hamiltonian that is diagonal in sublattice components ( suppressed in our notation ) , @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the dielectric constant of the background material , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are pauli matrices related to spin and dirac valley indices , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are zeeman and valley splittings . for @xmath41 and @xmath42 ,",
    "this hamitonian possesses an su(4 ) symmetry , with @xmath43 ( or any appropriate linear combinations thereof ) defining the weights in su(4 ) multiplets .",
    "composite fermions acquire additional labels ( quantum numbers ) @xmath44 , which come from a basis chosen in the fundamental representation of su(4 ) , and can be chosen conveniently to be @xmath45@xmath45 , @xmath45@xmath46 , @xmath46@xmath45 and @xmath46@xmath46 where the first arrow refers to valley and the second to spin .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the incompressible ground state in which @xmath48 @xmath15 levels with label @xmath44 are fully occupied .",
    "which of these states is the ground state depends @xcite on the values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a coupling between the spin and valley degrees of freedom and ll mixing are neglected in what follows .",
    "we neglect the anisotropy of the interaction due to underlying sublattice structure of the basis states , because such effects are small , being proportional to the ratio of the lattice constant @xmath49 to the magnetic length @xmath50 .",
    "the study of the residual lattice effects is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "another important assumption of our model is the neglect of disorder .",
    "this is a standard assumption in most quantitative studies of fqhe , because it is not known how to include the effect of disorder in a reliable manner .",
    "it is possible that disorder might be affecting different fqhe states differently , thus affecting their relative stability . in the absence of a reliable quantitative treatment of disorder , while comparing our results with experiment we will make the simplest assumption that while the disorder causes a significant reduction of the excitation gap , it does not change the order of stability of various fqhe states .",
    "strictly speaking , our results below ought to be considered as a prediction for future experiments in the limit of low disorder .",
    "the kinetic term still determines the coulomb matrix elements via the single - particle orbitals when the landau level is fixed . for the @xmath2",
    "ll the interelectron interaction is same as in gaas , because in this ll the single - particle states are identical for carriers with linear and quadratic dispersions . for @xmath51 , however , the two - component character of the single - particle states of massless dirac fermions produces different interaction pseudopotentials than in gaas . following standard practice ,",
    "@xcite we use a lowest ll basis with an effective interaction given in @xcite , which reproduces the @xmath4 graphene pseudopotentials .",

    "the electron - electron interaction is conveniently described in terms of pseudopotentials @xcite @xmath65 , which give the energy of two electrons in relative angular momentum @xmath17 .",
    "as the orbitals in the lowest ll in graphene are identical to those in the conventional two - dimensional electron gas , the pseudopotentials are identical too .",
    "the problem of interacting electrons in the @xmath31 ll of graphene can be mapped into a problem of interacting electrons in the lowest ll with the effective pseudopotentials @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 are laguerre polynomials .",
    "the monte carlo evaluation of the energy of variational wave functions , on the other hand , requires a real - space interaction . to simplify calculation , we construct the wave functions in the lowest ll , and use an effective real - space potential corresponding to the effective pseudopotentials @xmath68 in the lowest ll basis .",
    "following a well - tested procedure @xcite , we use the form @xmath69 and fit the coefficients @xmath70 to reproduce the first @xmath71 pseudopotentials @xmath68 of equation ( [ effective ] ) .",

    "( the quantity @xmath75 is the magnetic length .",
    "we could alternatively have chosen the gap of a prominent fqhe state . )",
    "the fqhe states in gaas are typically fully spin polarized for @xmath76 t , i.e. , for ratio @xmath770.5 @xcite .",
    "for graphene , this ratio is 1.8 ( 0.6 ) at @xmath78 t ( 4 t ) , suggesting that the spin degree of freedom may be frozen in the experiments of @xcite , which are performed at rather large @xmath79 .",

    "we assume in what follows that the valley splitting is small but large enough to suppress the cf valley - skyrmions ( cf skyrmions are rapidly suppressed by the zeeman / valley splitting @xcite ) , and the relevant excitation is a particle - hole pair of composite fermions .",
