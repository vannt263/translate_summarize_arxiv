    "the idea that there may exist a hidden mirror sector of particles and interactions with exactly the same properties as our visible world was suggested long time ago by lee and yang  @xcite , and the model with exact parity symmetry interchanging corresponding fields of two sectors was proposed many years later by foot at al .",
    "the two sectors communicate with each other only via gravity . a discrete symmetry",
    "@xmath0 interchanging corresponding fields of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , so called mirror parity , guarantees that two particle sectors are described by identical lagrangians , with all coupling constants ( gauge , yukawa , higgs ) having the same pattern . as a consequence",
    "the two sectors should have the same microphysics .",
    "once the visible matter is built up by ordinary baryons , then the mirror baryons would constitute dark matter in a natural way , since they interact with mirror photons , but not interact with ordinary photons .",
    "the phenomenology of mirror matter was studied in several papers ( for an extended list see the bibliografy of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in particular the implications for big bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite , primordial structure formation and cosmic microwave background  @xcite , large scale structure of the universe  @xcite , microlensing events ( machos )  @xcite .",
    "if the mirror ( m ) sector exists , then the universe along with the ordinary ( o ) particles should contain their mirror partners , but their densities are not the same in both sectors .",
    "in fact , the bbn bound on the effective number of extra light neutrinos implies that the m sector has a temperature lower than the o one , that can be naturally achieved in certain inflationary models  @xcite .",
    "then , two sectors have different initial conditions , they do not come into thermal equilibrium at later epoch and they evolve independently , separately conserving their entropies , and maintaining approximately constant the ratio among their temperatures .    all the differences with respect to the ordinary world can be described in terms of only two free parameters in the model , @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are respectively the ordinary ( mirror ) photon temperature , cosmological baryon density , and entropy density .",
    "the bounds on the mirror parameters are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the first one coming from the bbn limit and the second one from the hypothesis that a relevant fraction of dark matter is made of mirror baryons .    as far as the mirror world is cooler than the ordinary one , @xmath12 , in the mirror world all key epochs ( as are baryogenesis , nucleosynthesis , recombination , etc . )",
    "proceed in somewhat different conditions than in ordinary world .",
    "namely , in the mirror world the relevant processes go out of equilibrium earlier than in ordinary world , which has many far going implications .",
    "since ordinary and mirror sectors have the same microphysics , it is obvious that the neutrino decoupling temperature @xmath13 is the same in both of them , that is @xmath14 .",
    "we use this fact together with the entropy conservation to find equations which will give the mirror photon temperature @xmath5 and the ordinary and mirror thermodynamical quantities corresponding to any values of the ordinary photon temperature @xmath4 . from them",
    "it is possible to work out the total effective number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) in both sectors , which can be , as common in the literature , expressed in terms of total effective neutrino number @xmath15 .",
    "the presence of the other sector indeed , leads in both sectors to the same effects of having more particles .      at @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) ordinary ( mirror )",
    "neutrinos decouple and soon after ordinary ( mirror ) electrons and positrons annihilate",
    ".    the mirror world must be colder than the ordinary one and therefore the neutrino decoupling takes place before in the mirror sector .",
    "we can split the early universe evolution in three phases .",
    "\\1 ) @xmath25 : photons and neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium in both worlds , that is @xmath26 .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath27 : at @xmath28 m neutrinos decouple and soon after m electrons and positrons annihilate , raising the m photon temperature ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "nevertheless , o photons and neutrinos still have the same temperature ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "\\3 ) @xmath31 : at @xmath23 o neutrinos decouple and soon after o electrons and positrons annihilate , raising the o photon temperature ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we solved numerically equations and in order to work out the total , ordinary and mirror numbers of entropic ( @xmath33 ) and energetic ( @xmath34 ) dof at any temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding number of neutrinos @xmath35 is found assuming that all particles contributing to the universe energy density , to the exclusion of electrons , positrons and photons , are neutrinos ; in formula that means @xmath36    in table [ nnu - ord ] we report the asymptotic numerical results before ( @xmath37 = 5 mev ) and after ( @xmath37 = 0.005 mev ) bbn for different values of @xmath18 .",
    "we stress that the standard value @xmath38 is the same at any temperatures , while a distinctive feature of the mirror scenario is that the number of neutrinos raises with the temperature and with @xmath18 . anyway",
    ", this effect is not a problem ; on the contrary it may be useful since recent data fits give indications for a number of neutrinos at recent times higher than at bbn .",
    ".effective @xmath15 in the ordinary sector .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "the important moments for the structure formation are related to the matter - radiation equality ( mre ) and to the matter - radiation decoupling ( mrd ) epochs .",
    "the mre occurs at the redshift @xmath39 therefore , for @xmath40 it is not altered by the additional relativistic component of the m sector .",
    "the mirror mrd temperature @xmath41 can be calculated following the same lines as in the o one , obtaining @xmath42 , and hence @xmath43 so that the mrd in the m sector occurs earlier than in the o one .",
    "moreover , for values @xmath44 , the mirror photons would decouple yet during the radiation dominated period .",
    "this critical value plays an important role in our further considerations , where we distinguish between two cases : @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for typical values of @xmath47",
    "we obtain @xmath48 .",
    "the relevant scale for gravitational instabilities is the mirror jeans mass , defined as the minimum scale at which , in the matter dominated epoch , sub - horizon sized perturbations start to grow . in the case",
    "@xmath45 ( where the mirror decoupling happens after the matter - radiation equality ) its maximum value is reached just before the m decoupling , and is expressed in terms of the o one as @xmath49 which , for @xmath50 and @xmath12 , means that the jeans mass for the m baryons is lower than for the o ones , with implications for the structure formation . if , e.g. , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , then @xmath53 .",
    "we can also express the same quantity in terms of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , in the case that all the dark matter is in the form of m baryons , as @xmath57 for the case @xmath58 , the mirror decoupling happens before the matter - radiation equality . in this case",
    "we obtain for the highest value of the jeans mass just before decoupling the expression @xmath59 in case @xmath60 , the expressions ( [ mj_mir_1 ] ) and ( [ mj_mir_2 ] ) , respectively valid for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , are coincident , as we expect . if we consider the differences between the highest mirror jeans mass for the particular values @xmath63 , @xmath60 and @xmath64 , we obtain the following relations : @xmath65 density perturbations in m baryons on scales @xmath66 , which enter the horizon at @xmath67 , undergo uninterrupted linear growth .",
    "perturbations on scales @xmath68 start instead to oscillate after they enter the horizon , thus delaying their growth till the epoch of m photon decoupling .    as occurs for perturbations in the o baryonic sector , also the m baryon density fluctuations should undergo the strong collisional silk damping around the time of m recombination , so that the smallest perturbations that survive the dissipation will have the mass @xmath69 ^ 3 ( \\beta \\ , \\omega_b h^2)^{-5/4 } 10^{12}~ m_\\odot ~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "for @xmath74 we obtain @xmath75 , a typical galaxy mass .",
    "in order to obtain quantitative predictions we computed numerically the evolution of scalar adiabatic perturbations in a flat universe in which is present a significant fraction of mirror dark matter at the expenses of diminishing the cold dark matter ( cdm ) contribution and maintaining constant @xmath76 .",
    "[ cmblss ]   and @xmath77 , as compared with a reference standard model ( solid line ) and with observations .",
    "models where dark matter is entirely due to m baryons ( no cdm ) are plotted in _",
    "top panels _ for @xmath78 , while models with mixed cdm + m baryons ( @xmath79 ; @xmath80 ) in _ bottom panels .",
    "_ , title=\"fig : \" ]    we have chosen a `` reference cosmological model '' with the following set of parameters : @xmath81 .",
    "the dependence of the cmb and lss power spectra on the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath82 is shown in fig .",
    "[ cmblss ] .",
    "the predicted cmb spectrum is quite strongly dependent on the value of @xmath18 , and it becomes practically indistinguishable from the cdm case for @xmath83 .",
    "however , the effects on the cmb spectrum rather weakly depend on the fraction of mirror baryons . as a result of the oscillations in m baryons perturbation evolution",
    ", one observes oscillations in the lss power spectrum ; their position clearly depends on @xmath18 , while their depth depends on the mirror baryonic density . superimposed to oscillations",
    "one can see the cut - off in the power spectrum due to the aforementioned silk damping .    in the same figure our predictions",
    "can be compared with the observational data in order to obtain some general bound on the mirror parameters space .    *",
    "the present lss data are compatible with a scenario where all the dark matter is made of mirror baryons only if we consider enough small values of @xmath55 : @xmath84 .",
    "* high values of @xmath55 , @xmath85 , can be excluded even for a relatively small amount of mirror baryons .",
    "in fact , we observe relevant effects on lss and cmb power spectra down to values of m baryon density of the order @xmath86 . *",
    "intermediate values of @xmath55 , @xmath87 , can be allowed if the m baryons are a subdominant component of dark matter , @xmath88 . * for small values of @xmath55 , @xmath89 , the m baryons and",
    "the cdm scenarios are indistinguishable as concerns the cmb and the linear lss power spectra . in this case , in fact ,",
    "the mirror jeans and silk lengths , which mark region of the spectrum where the effects of mirror baryons are visible , decrease to very low values , which undergo non linear growth from relatively large redshift .",
    "thus , with the current experimental accuracy , we can exclude only models with high @xmath55 and high @xmath90 .",
    "[ resume ]     figure [ resume ] shows the current situation of the astrophysical research in presence of mirror dark matter . we have already investigated the early universe ( thermodynamics and big bang nucleosynthesis ) , and the process of structure formation in linear regime , that permit to obtain predictions , respectively , on the primordial elements abundances , and on the observed cosmic microwave background and large scale structure power spectra . in addition ,",
    "we have studied the evolution of mirror dark stars , which , together with the mirror star formation , are necessary ingredients for the study and the numerical simulations of non linear structure formation , and of the formation and evolution of galaxies ; furthermore , in future studies they will provide predictions on the observed abundances of machos and on the gravitational waves background .",
    "ultimately we will be able to obtain theoretical estimates to be compared with observations of gravitational lensing , galactic dark matter distribution , and strange astrophysical events still unexplained ( as for example dark galaxies , bullet galaxy , ... ) .",
