    "molecular motors @xcite are subject to intense study both from biological and technological point of view .",
    "they are paradigmatic examples of machines operating at nanometer scale . in a cell , motor proteins powered by atp hydrolysis @xcite help move molecules to places where they are needed .",
    "motors assist separation of chromosomes , copying dna into rna and perform many more functions @xcite .",
    "technological applications of the underlying mechanisms flourish @xcite , including e. g. brownian pumps @xcite and quantum tunneling ratchets @xcite .",
    "they provide also an invaluable testing ground for fundamental questions of transport phenomena far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "many models of molecular motors appeared in the literature since the pioneering work by ajdari and prost @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism is best elucidated in the models which rely on the ratchet mechanism @xcite and also bear the name brownian motors .",
    "the basic idea can be viewed either as diffusive motion of a particle in spatially asymmetric time - dependent potential or as chemically driven transitions between a finite number of mechano - chemical states .",
    "the former view is more intuitive , but the latter is closer to reality and opens the perspective of fitting the underlying transition probabilities to experimental data .",
    "more realistic models are rather built on markov chains in the configuration space constructed as product of spatial and internal ( chemical ) coordinates @xcite .",
    "this approach resides perhaps on more solid experimental evidence , but the absence of explicit potential makes it very difficult to assess the energetic efficiency , the question of principal importance in this paper .    indeed , one of the points of special interest here will be the question of the efficiency of molecular motors .",
    "several measures of efficiency can be found in literature .",
    "we shall use the classical thermodynamic definition @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is work performed and @xmath2 energy supplied to the system from external source .",
    "alternative measure takes into account viscous resistance @xcite , thus reflecting better the reality , at the cost that the inequality @xmath3 is not guaranteed automatically .",
    "yet other methods of measuring the efficiency involve explicitly the consumption of chemical energy @xcite , or the magnitude of the stopping force @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the former work ( @xcite ) explores the interacting motors and the mechanism if generating the non - zero current is related to spontaneous symmetry breaking and this it is principally different from the non - interacting case studied in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the direct comparison of the efficiency in these two cases is hardly possible .",
    "we are not aware of any work in which several measures of efficiency would be systematically compared on the same model .",
    "the efficiency of canonical brownian motors realized as either flashing or rocking ratchets was intensely studied @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the energetic efficiency is rather low @xcite , while the experimental data on motor proteins , e. g. the kinesin @xcite , report high efficiency , sometimes even estimated to be close to @xmath4 per cent .",
    "we are not in a position to judge the quantitative precision of these empirical estimates , although it can be suspected that the error margin is rather high .",
    "however , one is lead to a natural conclusion that the usual ratchet mechanism with diffusion as principal driving force is not an appropriate model for biological motors .    in idealized case we can distinguish between ratchet and power - stroke mechanisms for molecular motors @xcite , the latter relying rather on quasi - deterministic downhill motion in a free - energy landscape which evolves in time",
    "thus , the particles move as if trapped in a traveling potential wave .",
    "this idea was elaborated in a toy model of `` reversible ratchet '' @xcite , showing much higher efficiency , close to the biologically relevant figures .",
    "of course , arbitrary combinations and mixtures of the ratchet and power - stroke mechanisms can be invented and indeed , they are believed to be found in reality , e. g. in the myosin v motor ( see the review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to compare these two extremes .",
    "we should also note that high efficiency was characteristic of the models of either interacting @xcite or non - interacting @xcite motors , which do combine the ratchet and power - stroke mechanisms .",
    "the second point we shall concentrate on in this work will be the mutual repulsive interaction of molecular motors .",
    "in the cell , the steric ( hard - core ) repulsion of motor proteins influences significantly their behavior . for example , in gene transcription and translation large number of motor proteins move along the same track @xcite , forming the so - called `` christmas tree '' structures .",
    "thus , they show themselves as a physical realization of the well - studied asymmetric exclusion process , introduced first in the context of biopolymerization @xcite and later solved exactly in great detail , using sophisticated techniques @xcite .",
    "the model was adapted for molecular motors , which may attach and detach with defined rates @xcite .",
    "later , this situation was studied theoretically for the cases of kinesin @xcite , ribosomes @xcite , and rna polymerase @xcite , using the procedures developed in traffic models @xcite .",
    "the influence of the geometry of the compartment in which the interacting motors diffuse after detachment from the track was studied e. g. in @xcite .",
    "interaction of motors brings about even more complicated collective effects . in the cell , kinesin and",
    "dynein molecules typically carry the cargo in groups @xcite , resulting in current reversals .",
    "including explicitly the ratchet mechanism of driven diffusion of hard - rod particles leads to very intricate effects @xcite , if the particle size and the ratchet periodicity are incommensurate .",
    "the collective movement of coupled brownian motors was studied @xcite and in some cases the coupling was found to induce non - zero current and spontaneous oscillations even in mirror symmetric potential due to dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite . in analogy with these works , the motion of a few rigidly bound motors",
    "was studied @xcite .",
    "a special case of such interaction is the coordination of the two motor heads within single kinesin molecule , which leads also to non - trivial effects @xcite .",
    "finally , let us mention the interaction of the motors with the track , studied in `` burnt - bridge '' models , e. g. in ref .",

    "the potential at the third site , @xmath6 , is time independent . ]    in our previous paper @xcite we introduced a model , which is a modified version of the `` reversible ratchet '' .",
    "spatial coordinate is discretized , as e. g. in @xcite .",
    "tunable on - site repulsion between particles is introduced .",
    "we found in @xcite that not too strong interaction leads to increase of efficiency .",

    "quantitative agreement was reached in an improved mf treatment , developed in @xcite . here",
    "we investigate the model in depth by further numerical simulations .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    similar analysis can also make more clear the argument stated before , that the peaks in the response function at special values of @xmath102 are related to the enhanced sensitivity of certain configurations of particles to external load .",
    "for example , for @xmath82 such sensitive situation occurs when a particle tries to hop to a site where there is already a single particle . to support this view",
    "we plot a similar statistics as in fig .",
    "[ fig : count - plus - minus - shift - x-10 - 16-x-0 ] , but for the difference in the count for force @xmath137 and opposite @xmath138 , on condition that the site to which the particle is moving , already contains exactly one other particle .",
    "we can write that quantity as @xmath139 where @xmath35 is the original position of the particle , @xmath140 the position after the move , @xmath141 number of other particles at the site where the particle is about to move .",
    "we plot an example of this statistics in fig .",

    "we compare the situation at interaction @xmath48 , @xmath135 , and @xmath82 .",
    "we can see that the case @xmath82 is indeed special .",
    "the sensitivity to the external load is larger .",

    "the other parameters are @xmath136 , @xmath13 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "to understand better the effect of enhanced efficiency due to interaction , we shall look at the energy balance and fluctuations .",
    "first , we compare the values of current , efficiency and average input energy @xmath143 relative to their values at zero interaction , denoted @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , respectively .",
    "more precisely , we plot the typical interaction dependence of the quantities @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 in fig . [",
    "fig : eff - curr - ener - ener - vs - int-10 - 16-x-1a ] .",
    "we can clearly see that the initial increase of efficiency for small @xmath102 is accompanied by nearly no change in the current , while the input energy decreases .",
    "therefore , the enhanced efficiency is due to lower energy input , while the output ( the work ) remains nearly unchanged .",
    "when the interaction strength increases further , the current starts decreasing as well and so does the work , which is proportional to @xmath150 .",
    "this effect finally outweighs the lower energy input and the efficiency decreases again .",
    "this is the source of the maximum in the efficiency at moderate values of the interaction .",
    "we can get a bit more detailed information if we split the input energy into its positive and negative parts .",
    "recall , that according to the definition ( [ eq : def - distr - ein - dx ] ) the input energy is @xmath151 .",
    "we separate the contributions from times when @xmath152 is positive from those when it is negative .",
    "the former correspond to the shift of the potential @xmath53 upward , that latter to its downward move .",
    "so , @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the heaviside function .",
    "with this definition we have @xmath155 .",
    "we then define the contributions from positive and negative potential moves to the quantity @xmath156 as @xmath157 and @xmath158 where , as above , the subscript @xmath159 denotes the quantities computed at @xmath48 . hence @xmath160 .",
    "we show the dependence of @xmath161 again in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - curr - ener - ener - vs - int-10 - 16-x-1a ] .",
    "we can see that both positive and negative parts contribute to the decrease of the input energy .",
    "the contribution of the positive part is larger in the most interesting region of moderate @xmath102 , where the efficiency grows with interaction , while for larger @xmath102 the decrease of the negative part becomes more important .",
    "this leads to the following explanation of the effect of increased efficiency .     and the time lag @xmath162 ( i. e. @xmath163 periods ) .",
    "the temperature is @xmath13 ( @xmath76 and @xmath74 ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath164 and @xmath79 ) . the interaction is @xmath48 ( @xmath76 and @xmath79 ) , @xmath165 ( @xmath164 and @xmath74 ) . the remaining parameters are @xmath136 , @xmath11 .",
    "the horizontal axis is normalized by the number of time periods , which is @xmath166 , therefore it expresses the shift per period . ]    at not too high temperature , the particles are chiefly driven by the traveling wave of the periodic potential .",
    "this is the power - stroke mechanism of the molecular motor . when the interaction is switched on , but remains small , the particles move in an effective potential which differ little from the original traveling wave .",
    "so , the current remains nearly the same , as testified in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - curr - ener - ener - vs - int-10 - 16-x-1a ] , while the input energy is lowered , as is also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - curr - ener - ener - vs - int-10 - 16-x-1a ] . this lowering could be understood as follows . on the other hand ,",
    "the repulsion affects the distribution of particles within the period of the potential @xmath104 .",
    "the minima become shallower , therefore the particles are less concentrated at them .",
    "but it is the minimum of the potential which is shifted above in the time evolution of the potential , so it is the particle at the minimum that acquires the energy from the source of the driving .",
    "less particles at the minimum equals less input of energy , more precisely lowering of the positive part of the input energy .",
    "conversely , the particles pushed off the instantaneous minima of the potential are found at the maxima of the potential .",
    "but these particles suffer lowering of the time - dependent potential , i. e. returning the energy back to the external source , therefore lowering also the negative part of the input energy .",
    "these two effects , i. e. unchanged current and lowered energy input , are the explanation of the increased efficiency . of course , more subtle effects are also at work here .",
    "especially , also the negative part of the energy input contributes .",
    "more importantly , if the interaction is strong enough , it changes the potential the particles move in to such extent that the current diminishes . at very small temperature ,",
    "the current is sensitive to tiny changes in the shape of the potential and small changes in the interaction strength can cause big jumps in the current .",
    "we have seen these jumps in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff - vs - int-1200 - 1200-all-16-x-1 ] .",
    "in addition to the averages , we measured also the full joint distribution function of particle shift and input energy ( [ eq : def - distr - ein - dx ] ) . because the work performed by one particle is proportional to its shift , we have in fact the joint distribution of performed work and input energy . as a first piece of information we plot in fig . [",
    "fig : energyin-1200 - 1200-all-16-all-1a ] the average energy input at fixed value of the particle shift , during the time interval @xmath71 .",
    "we can observe the already discussed fact that interaction decreases the energy input .",
    "here we can see that it holds also for most values of the shift , i. e. work performed by one single particle , separately .",
    "( i. e. @xmath4 periods ) .",
    "the fixed shift is @xmath167 ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath168 ( @xmath75 ) , and @xmath169 ( @xmath74).the other parameters are @xmath136 , @xmath13 , @xmath10 , @xmath165 , and @xmath11 .",

    "( i. e. @xmath170 periods ) , relative to the most probable value @xmath171 .",

    "the horizontal axis is normalized by the number of time periods , which is @xmath166 , therefore it expresses the shift per period . ]",
    "the probability distribution of the energy input at fixed shift is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : enerdistr-1200 - 1200 - 10 - 16-all-1 ] .",
    "we can see that the shape is pretty close to a gaussian .",
    "this is far from being true for the distribution of the shift , which is proportional to the work performed by a single particle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shiftdistr-1200 - 1200 - 10 - 16-all-1 ] .",
    "the distribution is skewed ; when we compare the shifts shorter and longer than the most probable value , we find that the shorter are significantly more probable than the longer ones .",
    "this is due to the far - from - equilibrium character of the process .",
    "we can also see that the distribution is composed of two separate branches .",
    "the first one , with higher probability , corresponds to shifts which are multiples of @xmath32 , the period of the potential .",
    "the other shifts have significantly lower probability .",
    "in fact , it comes as no big surprise , that after integer number of time periods the particles like to be shifted by integer number of spatial periods .",
    "the most important finding , however , stems from the comparison of the distribution in the case with and without interaction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : shiftdistr-1200 - 1200 - 10 - 16-all-1 ] we make this comparison for such set of parameters where we know that the interacting case exhibits higher efficiency . by analogy with equilibrium statistical physics one might be tempted to guess that higher efficiency is accompanied , or even caused , by milder fluctuations .",
    "the opposite holds in our model of the molecular motor .",
    "the fluctuations of the work performed by a single particle are higher in the interacting case .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the increase of efficiency is not accompanied by decrease of fluctuations . on the contrary , the study of the energy balance discussed above together with the fact of increased fluctuations shows that the enhancement of efficiency is purely an energy effect .",
    "interacting molecular motors moving in the power - stroke regime were modeled using a `` reversible ratchet '' model .",
    "tunable on - site repulsive interaction leads to a host of intricate phenomena .",
    "the most important of them is the increase of energetic efficiency for small to moderate values of the interaction strength .",
    "we traced the origin of this effect to energy balance of the process .",
    "when the interaction is increased from zero , the performed work remains practically unchanged , while the input energy decreases . at the same time , the fluctuations of the performed work increase .",
    "this implies that the enhanced efficiency does not originate from the suppression of fluctuations , contrary to the situation in equilibrium heat machines .",
    "moreover , we observed that at very low temperature the dependence of current as well as efficiency on the interaction strength is rather complex , composed of many upward and downward steps .",
    "hence , the efficiency has several , rather than single , local maxima as a function of interaction . as for the current , for suitable values of the parameters we can observe a sequence of current reversals when we increase the interaction strength .",
    "this complicated behavior is due to the interplay between size of steps in the external periodic potential , in which a particle moves , and the size of additional contributions to the potential from the interaction with other particles .",
    "however , this complicated dependence gradually disappears when the temperature increases .",
    "but the effect of current reversal due to interaction remains still visible .",
    "we also investigated the response function of the current with respect to external load , both for zero load and for zero current .",
    "we showed that these two response functions differ substantially at zero or small interaction , but become identical when the interaction is large .",
    "we also revealed the structure with several peaks for both density and interaction dependence of the response function .",
    "detailed study of the location of these maxima and minima showed that they correspond to specific fractional values of density and interaction .",
    "for example , the response is zero if the density is integer number and has maximum for densities equal to integer number of thirds , except the values which are themselves integers . in the interaction dependence",
    ", the peaks were found close to interaction strength equal to one half , one third and one fourth .",
    "we speculate that these special values are due to the fact that in those cases just one , two , and three particles on the same site , respectively , contribute to the potential by the value exactly equal to the amplitude of the external periodic potential .",
    "contrary to the complicated step structure in the current , the peak structure in the response function survives also at higher temperatures .",
    "the probability distribution of performed work and input energy reveals that the interaction leads to the increase of fluctuations , as we already mentioned .",
    "but we can see more .",
    "first , the distribution of work is far from gaussian .",
    "it is skewed so that the lower particle shift ( i. e. work performed by an individual particle ) relative to the maximum is more probable .",
    "this is the sign of far - from - equilibrium regime of the transport in the molecular motor . on the other hand ,",
    "the input energy is gaussian - distributed , when observed at fixed work .",
    "there is also a very interesting principal question related to large - deviation properties of the fluctuation of the performed work .",
    "we made some simulations in this direction , which show that the work distribution , when properly rescaled , converges to a large - deviation function . in the last decade",
    ", there was a great surge of activity in the field of fluctuation theorems @xcite but in our case the problem of applying these results lies in the choice of the proper quantity which would be both physically meaningful ( or at least the physical meaning must not be enormously intricate ) and satisfy the fluctuation theorem in some of the forms known so far .",
    "this question remains open .",
    "finally , we must also admit several drawbacks of our model , which can be lifted only by setting up a completely different scheme of particle movement .",
    "the first point is that the potential changes synchronously at all sites .",
    "this is unrealistic in biological motors , where each molecule has its internal `` clock '' telling in what phase of the chemical cycle the motor finds itself .",
    "it could be easily possible to simulate an asynchronous version of the algorithm .",
    "on the other hand , in technological applications the synchronicity in the potential changes may be built in into the system .",
    "the second point concerns the tunable interaction used in our model .",
    "motor proteins interact always by steric hard - core repulsion and th effective weak repulsion may occur only as projection of real three - dimensional situation onto one - dimensional effective model @xcite .",
    "however , there is no principal obstacle to simulate three - dimensional case directly , if only sufficient computer power is available .",
    "another way out is to generalize the asymmetric exclusion process in such a way that the maximum number of particles one site may accommodate is not one , but two , or three , etc .",
    "simulations in this direction are under way .",
