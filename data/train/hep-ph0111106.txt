    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is very successful in explaining most of the elementary particle physics phenomena at the electroweak scale . unfortunately , despite of its eminent success , the sm suffers from certain drawbacks , the hierarchy problem being a major one .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite provides an elegant solution and , consequently has been extensively studied as a model beyond the sm . if such a new physics exists at the electroweak scale , then it may provide some experimental signature in the future , or even in present data .",
    "looking for such new physics effects constitutes a major area of research in high energy physics today .",
    "there are two major ways one can see such effects .",
    "one is to observe their direct effects in the high energy collider experiments when a new particle is produced and observed through its decays .",
    "the other way , is to look for indirect evidence in the deviation from the sm prediction of low energy experimental data .",
    "recent results from the ongoing experiments in @xmath1-physics at cleo , babar , and belle have attracted lot of attention .",
    "much of this attention has been devoted to the results on nonleptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons , which can be used to extract information on the ckm matrix elements and cp violation .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the nonleptonic decays of @xmath1 mesons is an extremely demanding challenge due to difficulties in calculating the relevant hadronic matrix elements .",
    "to have some idea of the magnitude of the matrix elements , one usually uses factorization method , factorizing the four quark operators relevant to non - leptonic @xmath1 decays into the products of two currents and evaluating separately the matrix elements of the two currents .",
    "recently the qcd improved factorization method for the hadronic @xmath1 decays has been developed .",
    "this method incorporates elements of the naive factorization approach ( as its leading term ) and perturbative qcd corrections ( as subleading contributions ) allowing one to compute systematic radiative corrections to the naive factorization for the hadronic @xmath1 decays  @xcite . in our analysis we will use the formalism developed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this qcd - improved factorization method improves the analysis on several aspects , including among others the number of colors , the gluon virtuality , the renormalization scale , and the scheme dependence .",
    "the method is expected to give a good estimate of the magnitudes of the hadronic matrix elements in non - leptonic @xmath1 decays , and has been used to calculate @xmath1 decays in the sm  @xcite and models beyond  @xcite .",
    "the construction of most general supersymmetric extension of the standard model leads to baryon @xmath8 and lepton @xmath9 number violating operators in the superpotential .",
    "the simultaneous presence of both @xmath9 and @xmath8 number violating operators induce rapid proton decay which may contradict the strict experimental bound  @xcite . in order to keep the proton lifetime within the experimental limit , one needs to impose additional symmetry beyond the sm gauge symmetry to force the unwanted baryon and lepton number violating interactions to vanish . in most cases ,",
    "this has been done by imposing a discrete symmetry called @xmath0-parity  @xcite , defined as @xmath10 , where , @xmath11 is the spin of the particle .",
    "this symmetry not only forbids rapid proton decay  @xcite , it also render stable the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "however , this symmetry is _ ad hoc _ in nature .",
    "there are no strong theoretical arguments in support of this discrete symmetry .",
    "hence , it is interesting to see the phenomenological consequences of the breaking of @xmath0-parity in such a way that either @xmath12 or @xmath13 number is violated both are not simultaneously violated , thus avoiding rapid proton decays .",
    "extensive studies have been done to look for the direct as well as indirect evidence of @xmath0-parity violation from different processes and to put constraints on various @xmath0-parity violating couplings  [ [ rpv_review ] , [ majorana]-[aa ] ] .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to constraint various @xmath0-parity violating couplings using the data on @xmath2 decay channels and a calculation based on qcd - improved factorization . here",
    "@xmath14 is one of the s(3 ) flavor octet pseudoscalars .",
    "we find that using the experimental data on the branching ratios of @xmath2 mode , stringent upper bounds on the products of several @xmath13 and @xmath12 violating couplings can be obtained .",
    "many of the bounds obtained are stronger than the existing ones .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in section",
    "( 2 ) we study possible four quark operators which can induce @xmath15 decays with @xmath0-parity violating interactions . in section ( 3 ) we calculate @xmath16 decay amplitudes using the qcd - improved factorization method . at last in section ( 4 ) ,",
    "we carry out numerical analysis , present and discuss our results and finally draw our conclusions .",
    "the most general superpotential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , which describes @xmath17 gauge invariant , renormalizable and supersymmetric theory , with minimal particle content , has @xmath0-parity violating interaction terms@xcite : & = & _ [ ij]k l_il_j e^c_k + ^_ijk l_i q_j d^c_k + ^_i[jk ] u_i^c d^c_j d^c_k [ rpv1 ] where , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the @xmath20-doublet lepton and quark superfields and @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the singlet superfields , while @xmath24 are flavor indices . in writing the above we have omitted gauge indices , which ensures that the @xmath25 are antisymmetric in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and the @xmath28 are antisymmetric in @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is very clear that the first two terms in equation ( [ rpv1 ] ) violate lepton number , while the last term violates baryon number .",

    "not all of them will induce @xmath15 decays to the lowest order . at the dimension six four - fermion interaction level",
    "only operators corresponding to the couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 will lead to hadronic @xmath15 decays .",

    ", we will use the qcd - improved factorization method to carry out the analysis .",
    "the factorization approximation has been used to provide estimates for the decay amplitudes in @xmath1 decays .",
    "recently it has been shown that factorization approximation in fact is supported by perturbative qcd calculations in the heavy quark limit , and the qcd - improved factorization method has been developed@xcite .",
    "this new factorization formula incorporates elements of the naive factorization approach and introduces corrections in the amplitudes .    in the heavy quark limit",
    ", the decay amplitude @xmath56 due to some particular operator @xmath57 can be represented in the form  @xcite = < p_2j_20 > < p_1 j_1 b > the above result reduces to the naive factorization if we neglect the power corrections in @xmath58 and the radiative corrections in @xmath59 .",
    "the radiative corrections , which are dominated by the hard gluon exchange can be computed with perturbation theory in the heavy quark limit , in terms of the convolution of the hard scattering kernel and the light cone distribution amplitudes of the mesons .",

    "there are several cases , where there is no direct limit on the products of the couplings , in that case we take the products of their individual bounds from ref.@xcite . as it can be seen in  @xcite that the bounds on the first two generation individual couplings are much stronger than the third generation .",
    "for this reason , in most of the cases , the product of either or both first two generation individual couplings are much stronger than our prediction .",
    "furthermore , we find that bounds on the pair of couplings @xmath140 , and @xmath141 obtained from @xmath142 oscillation and double nucleon decays , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , obtained from @xmath146 are stronger than ours .",
    "it is , however , interesting to note that , more than half of the bounds obtained in this paper are better than the existing ones .",
    "in addition to that , the bounds on @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 couplings are completely new , in a sense that there were no previous bounds on these pairs of couplings from any experimental data , they were from perturbative unitarity . in two of these cases ( @xmath151 and @xmath152 )",
    "we have improved the existing bound by over two orders of magnitude .    before we go",
    "conclude we would like mention the possible theoretical uncertainties in the bounds arising from several input parameters .",
    "as described before , we have obtained all of our bounds by using the central values for the relevant parameters , the ckm matrix elements , the quark masses , the form factors .",
    "we have also parametrized the hard spectator contribution by some default number .",
    "some of these parameters may change up to @xmath153 , and the uncertainty in the hard spectator contribution may be even larger . even allowing for this , we do not expect our result to change more than factor of two .    in this paper we have studied @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 decays based on the qcd improved factorization approach in the presence of @xmath0-parity violating couplings . comparing our calculated branching ratios @xmath15 with the experimental data , we have obtained bounds on the products of two @xmath0-parity violating couplings .",
    "we found that most of the bounds we obtained on combinations of the @xmath30 and @xmath32 type of couplings are stronger than the existing limits .",
    "rare hadronic b decays can provide important information about @xmath0-parity violating interactions .",
