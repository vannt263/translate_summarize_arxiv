    "perturbing the ground state of an interacting quantum many - body system and linearizing the heisenberg equations of motion for the boson fock operators , one faces the standard problem of small oscillations .",
    "concrete examples are furnished by the vibrational modes of a solid , the spin waves in a magnet , the electromagnetic modes in an optical medium , and the oscillations of the superfluid density of a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "common to these excitations is that they second - quantize as bosons or bosonic quasi - particles .    adding some amount of disorder to the system",
    ", one may ask : what are the statistical features of the excitation spectrum and , in particular , which of these features ( if any ) reflect the bosonic nature of the quasi - particle excitations ? is there some kind of universality akin to the wigner - dyson universality known from other disordered systems ?",
    "if so , what are the universal laws , and what s the role of symmetry in determining these laws ?    in the parallel case of fermionic quasi - particles the situation is now fairly well understood .",
    "if the system is of metallic type and in the ergodic limit , the statistical behavior at high energies is in accord with the universal laws of wigner - dyson statistics . for low excitation energies , however , the canonical anti - commutation relations obeyed by the fermion operators make themselves felt : they constrain the form of the hamiltonian matrix and",
    "thus give rise to several new universality classes beyond dyson s threefold way @xcite .",
    "some of these are realized by chiral dirac fermions in a random gauge field @xcite , others by quasi - particles in disordered gapless superconductors @xcite .",
    "a complete symmetry classification of quadratic fermion hamiltonians has been carried out @xcite , and the role of riemannian symmetric spaces and superspaces in providing an effective description has been emphasized @xcite .",
    "progress has been slower for bosonic systems , and so for good reason , as these are set apart by several distinctive features from other random problems studied and solved in the past . for one thing , in the case of bosons it makes little sense to choose  as one often does for fermions  the matrix elements of the quasi - particle hamiltonian as independent and identically distributed random variables .",
    "in fact , most of the boson hamiltonians produced in such a manner would generate runaway dynamics rather than oscillatory motion around a stable ground state . in the case of bosons",
    "one therefore has to pay attention to the fact that the matrix elements depend in a complicated way on the ground state of the many - boson system and hence on the disorder of the microscopic parent problem @xcite . as a technical consequence ,",
    "a direct analog of the so - called gaussian ensembles , which were pivotal in initiating the wigner - dyson theory and establishing its universal statistics , is unavailable in the context of bosons .    for another complication ,",
    "low - frequency bosons are usually insensitive to weak disorder .",
    "many of the excitations listed above are goldstone bosons associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry , and for such excitations low frequency is tantamount to low wave number , or large wave length , which causes the scattering by disorder to be suppressed , as the disorder is effectively seen only on average over regions of size given by the large wave length .",
    "thus the disorder averages out and becomes less effective , and hence the behavior of weakly disordered goldstone bosons tends to be system - specific .",
    "( of course this still leaves it possible for weakly disordered bosons of _",
    "non_-goldstone type to exhibit universal statistics @xcite . ) in order for any universality to set in , the disorder strength often has to be so large that standard calculational tools such as the impurity diagram technique fail to apply .    in the present paper we are going to introduce and completely solve a simple random matrix model of disordered bosonic quasi - particles , which we believe to be most closely analogous to the wigner - dyson gaussian ensembles while retaining the crucial features of bosonic statistics and stability of the motion . in a follow - up paper",
    "we will investigate the question whether this simple model might be representative of a whole universality class of related problems .    to formulate the model ,",
    "let @xmath0 @xmath1 be a canonical set of position and momentum operators , and consider their linearized heisenberg equations of motion in the most general form : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are real numbers . if the system was invariant under time reversal ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , the coefficients @xmath5 would have to be zero , but we here consider the generic case without symmetries .",
    "the criterion for stability of the dynamics is that the stability matrix be positive : @xmath8 assuming @xmath9 , the generator of the heisenberg time evolution , @xmath10 has eigenvalues that come as imaginary pairs @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the characteristic frequencies ( or single - boson energies ) of the small - amplitude motion . in a classical setting one would introduce the generator @xmath14 as the symplectic gradient of the hamiltonian function linearized at a stable equilibrium point of the classical flow .",
    "the natural transformation group of the problem at hand is the real symplectic group in @xmath15 dimensions , @xmath16 , acting by linear canonical transformations on the operators @xmath17 and by conjugation on the generator @xmath18 .",
    "we can now explain one of the distinctive features of the present problem : when formulating the gaussian ensembles of the wigner - dyson theory one makes the postulate that the transformation group of the problem ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or @xmath21 , as the case may be ) also be the symmetry group of the chosen probability measure , whereas in our case no such simplification is possible .",
    "indeed , @xmath16 is non - compact , and a probability measure @xmath22 can not be invariant under a non - compact group action and at the same time have total mass @xmath23 .",
    "one is therefore looking for some construction principle other than symmetry .",
    "our key here is the positivity of the real symmetric stability matrix @xmath24 a natural way of building positive real symmetric matrices @xmath25 is by adding a sufficient number of rank - one projectors with positive weights .",
    "equivalently , we may put @xmath26 for some set of real numbers @xmath27 .",
    "we now consider the @xmath28 as the fundamental variables , and choose them to be independent and normal ( or gaussian ) distributed random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath29",
    ". then we use ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) to push forward the normal distribution for the @xmath28 to a probability distribution @xmath30 for @xmath25 ( and hence for @xmath14 ) . if @xmath31 , the result is @xmath32 with the domain for @xmath25 still defined by @xmath33 .",
    "the probability distribution ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) is the object of study of this paper .",
    "we now give a summary of the contents and the results of the paper . after collecting some basic facts from symplectic linear algebra in sect .",

    "we compute the large-@xmath39 asymptotics of this kernel in the bulk of the spectrum ( in sect .",
    "[ sect : v.d ] ) and at the ` hard ' edge @xmath40 ( sect .",
    "[ sect : v.e ] ) , using a contour integral representation of the bi - orthogonal polynomials ( sect.[sect : v.c ] ) . in the former case",
    "we establish the scaling limit @xmath41 which is independent of @xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath43 of the scaling variable @xmath44 is the large-@xmath39 limit of the level density .",
    "viewing @xmath45 as the imaginary part of a green s function @xmath46 , the function @xmath47 is the real part .",
    "we compute @xmath43 by two independent methods ( from a variational calculation in sect.[sect : cubic ] , and from bi - orthogonal polynomials in sect.[sect : v.d ] ) , with the result being @xmath48 apart from the last factor , which is irrelevant since it cancels on passing to the level correlation functions , the right - hand side of ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) is the famous sine kernel known from systems with unitary symmetry .",
    "thus we recover wigner - dyson universality of the class of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) at bulk frequencies .    at low frequencies",
    "@xmath49 we find convergence to an unusual kind of scaling limit : @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the unit circle in @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is any axis in the right half plane parallel to the imaginary axis .",
    "the result ( [ eq:1.6 ] ) is reminiscent of formulas obtained by efetov s supersymmetry method , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 playing the role of radial polar coordinates of a riemannian symmetric superspace .",
    "we intend to elucidate this connection in a future publication .",
    "let there be some position variables @xmath56 and canonical momenta @xmath57 , and consider hamiltonians @xmath58 of the quadratic form @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are real matrices satisfying @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "rewriting @xmath58 as @xmath65 we see that the matrix , @xmath14 , of @xmath58 satisfies the linear condition @xmath66 this is saying that @xmath14 lies in @xmath67 , the lie algebra of the real symplectic group defined by @xmath68 a matrix @xmath69 need not be diagonalizable ( e.g. , the generator of free motion , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , is nt ) ; and even if it is , the eigenvalues will in general be complex .",
    "we now impose the condition @xmath72 i.e. , we require all eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrix @xmath25 to be positive . the corresponding domain in @xmath73 will be denoted by @xmath74 : @xmath75 although the eigenvalues of @xmath25 have no direct relation to the dynamics of the system , positivity of @xmath25 ensures that the motion generated by the hamiltonian @xmath58 is stable , or ` elliptic ' . as a consequence of ellipticity , there exists some linear canonical transformation @xmath76 which takes the hamiltonian to a sum of harmonic oscillators , @xmath77 with @xmath78 . put differently , for @xmath79",

    "let @xmath88 be the subset of block - diagonal @xmath87 with positive @xmath89 . then",
    ", as we said earlier , every @xmath79 is conjugate to a unique @xmath90 by some @xmath80 .",
    "thirdly , introducing @xmath91 , which is an @xmath39-dimensional compact torus , @xmath92 , let @xmath93 be the quotient of @xmath94 by the right action of @xmath95 . then the mapping @xmath96 ( the reverse of the process of quasi - diagonalization ) , is a smooth bijection .",
    "we are stating these facts without proof , as they are standard facts of symplectic linear algebra .",
    "by placing a probability distribution on the elliptic domain @xmath74 , one gets a random matrix model for disordered bosonic quasi - particles .",
    "we are then interested in the statistics of the characteristic frequencies or levels @xmath89 .",
    "it is well known that in the wigner - dyson situation of random hermitian or random real symmetric matrices , where the symmetry group is compact , the level correlation functions exhibit universal behavior in a suitable scaling limit .",
    "one may therefore ask whether a similar scenario  leading to universal laws , possibly of a new kind  might be at work in the case being considered .    to answer this question we need to investigate a class of probability distributions on @xmath74 as wide as possible . as a first step , the present paper deals with a family of well motivated distributions which are easy to analyze .      coming from the standard wigner - dyson situation with a compact symmetry group",
    ", one might be inclined to try and consider a gaussian distribution @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a lebesgue measure for @xmath74 : @xmath99 however , such a distribution has infinite mass , since it is invariant under the action @xmath100 by the _ non - compact _ group @xmath85 , and it therefore can not be normalized to be a probability measure .    staying within the class of gaussian distributions , a better choice of distribution function is @xmath101 for some positive parameters @xmath102 . because of the presence of @xmath103 under the trace , this distribution function is invariant under conjugation @xmath100 only if @xmath104 satisfies the additional condition @xmath105 . combining the two conditions , @xmath106",
    ", one sees that the invariance group of the function @xmath107 in ( [ eq : distr - funct ] ) is the intersection of the real symplectic and orthogonal groups in @xmath15 dimensions : @xmath108 this group @xmath109 is isomorphic to @xmath20 , the group of unitary transformations in @xmath39 complex dimensions . indeed , changing from the symplectic basis @xmath110 to the oscillator basis @xmath111",
    "one finds that @xmath109 is the subgroup of canonical transformations that do not mix the lowering operators @xmath112 with the raising operators @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , @xmath114 is known to be a maximal compact subgroup .",
    "it therefore is the biggest symmetry group possible in our problem .    in the sequel we will consider ( [ eq : distr - funct ] ) with @xmath115 .",
    "thus we take our probability distribution to be @xmath116 with the normalization constant @xmath117 chosen in such a way that @xmath118 .",

    "the probability measure @xmath122 @xmath123 the problem of computing such expectations is best tackled by using the polar decomposition @xmath124 which is given by quasi - diagonalization of @xmath14 ; see ( [ eq : polar ] ) .",
    "inserting that decomposition into ( [ eq : averages ] ) one has @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a @xmath127-invariant measure for @xmath93 , and @xmath128 is the jacobian of the change of variables @xmath129 .    let us calculate this jacobian .",

    "thus , by taking the product of all non - vanishing roots , @xmath134    to complete the polar integration formula ( [ eq : reduce ] ) we need @xmath135 . in the next subsection we are going to show that this integral can be calculated in closed form and depends on @xmath136 as @xmath137 thus , in total ,",

    "we denote the integral on the left - hand side of ( [ eq : hciz ] ) by @xmath141 what makes this integral computable in closed form is that @xmath142 lies in @xmath73 and @xmath143 is the adjoint action of @xmath144 on its lie algebra .",

    "let @xmath145 and @xmath146 be haar measures for @xmath127 and @xmath95 , respectively , with @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "our first step is to switch from @xmath93 to integrating over the full symplectic group @xmath149 @xmath150    next we use that @xmath145 is invariant under inversion , @xmath151 .",

    "such spaces carry the structure of a khler manifold , which means that @xmath155 comes with a non - degenerate , closed , and @xmath127-invariant 2-form ( the khler form of @xmath155 ) .",

    "raising @xmath164 to its @xmath165 exterior power one obtains a top - dimensional form , @xmath166 , which is still @xmath127-invariant and nonzero .",
    "since @xmath155 is homogeneous , there can be at most one such form up to multiplication by scalars .",
    "therefore , there exists some ( nonzero ) constant such that @xmath167    by darboux s theorem one can find local symplectic coordinates for @xmath155 that bring @xmath164 into canonical form .",
    "while this fact by itself would not be of much practical help , in the present case such coordinates exist _ globally _ and , moreover , they can be chosen in such a way that @xmath168 depends on them _ quadratically_.    to describe these perfect coordinates , consider the space of complex symmetric @xmath169 matrices , @xmath170 , which has dimension @xmath171 over @xmath172 and thus shares with @xmath155 the dimension @xmath173 over @xmath174 . with every @xmath175 associate a positive hermitian @xmath176 matrix @xmath177 by @xmath178    now",
