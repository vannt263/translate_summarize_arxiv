    "after this paper has been written , paper @xcite appeared , where ( among some other topics ) the addition law for energy - momentum was modified as compared to the one used in @xcite .",
    "this was done to comply with the physical requirement that a set of particles with even sub - planckian energies can have an energy much exceeding the planck energy .",
    "the modification was achieved by simply replacing the planck energy @xmath123 in our units ) for a system of @xmath115 particles with @xmath124 .",
    "+ here we demonstrate that the modified addition law follows from our scheme , by simply adjusting one of our postulates ( postulate iii , ) .",
    "the modification is as follows : we require that for a set of @xmath115 particles the upper bound on both energy and momentum ( normalized by planck energy @xmath0 ) is to be not @xmath125 , but @xmath115 .",
    "this is equivalent to a postulate that the energy composition law for particles ( _ each having planck energy _ ) is a simple addition . in turn , postulate ( @xmath126)for one particle follows from that as a particular case of @xmath127 .",
    "+ thus , if we use thus modified postulate in eqs.([11a],[11b ] ) , we obtain the following value of constant @xmath37 which now depends on the number of particles @xmath115 : @xmath128 as a result , the energy @xmath129 and momentum @xmath130 of a set of @xmath115 particles follow from eqs .",

    "<S> this difficulty is emphasized @xcite by what looks like apparent non - physical predictions of one of these constructions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + here we revisit the latter work @xcite , more specifically its treatment of the energy - momentum domain , this time departing not from the group - theoretical point of view , but rather from certain physically justified restrictions ( postulates ) imposed on the classically - defined physical quantities , namely energy , mass , and velocity . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous approach was used in @xcite for a more narrowly defined goal : a study of possible definitions of @xmath0-deformed velocities and their addition laws .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by introducing the postulates defining    \\i ) the velocity of a particle ,    ii)its mass to be the same for any scale ( from classical to planck scale ) and therefore based on the relations provided by the momentum sector of classical relativity ,    iii)the existence of the upper bound ( the planck energy ) on the values of both energy and momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we also retain the upper bound ( speed of light @xmath2 ) on a particle velocity . </S>",

    "<S> + to determine both , we notice that since in the classical limit @xmath41 the positive(negative ) values of @xmath15 should correspond to positive ( negative ) values of @xmath42 respectively . </S>",

    "<S> + if we use the classical expressions for @xmath50 ( with the same @xmath26 and @xmath29 in all the regions ) @xmath51 and eqs.([10a]),([10b ] ) then we readily obtain ( restricting our attention to the positive region of @xmath42 ) the respective expressions ( cf.@xcite ) for @xmath52 : @xmath53 from ( [ add ] ) follows that the rest energy @xmath54 less than the mass @xmath29 : @xmath55 here the equality sign corresponds to the classical region @xmath56 + from expressions ( [ 13 ] ) , ( [ 14 ] ) we obtain the inversion formulas : @xmath57 @xmath58    if we use classical casimir and expressions ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) then the respective casimirs for the energy - momentum in the planck region are    @xmath59    @xmath60    where ( @xmath61 ) corresponds to the positive values of @xmath42 and ( @xmath62 ) corresponds to negative values of @xmath42 . solving eqs.([17a]),([17b ] ) with respect to @xmath42 and choosing the correct signs ( according to the positive and negative values of @xmath42 , remembering that both @xmath63 ) we arrive at the following relation    ; @xmath64 curves correspond to the values of masses @xmath65,width=226,height=226 ]    @xmath66    where the upper(lower ) sign corresponds to @xmath67 respectively . </S>",

    "<S> , we can calculate in an elementary fashion the respective boost relations ( found by magueijo and smolin in @xcite with the help of group - theoretical analysis ) energy- momentum @xmath52 at the planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> we write them in the dimensionless form :    @xmath73    @xmath74    here @xmath75 is the kroenecker delta - function and @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> since particle s velocity has been defined as @xmath77 , it is not surprising that eqs.([19a],[19b ] ) yield the velocity addition rule , coinciding with the classical relativistic rule : @xmath78    it was shown in @xcite that within the context of @xmath0-poinciana algebra various possible doubly - special relativity constructions can be viewed as different bases of this algebra . in particular , magueijo - smolin basis @xcite is one of such bases . in a more general scheme of things , j.lukierski and collaborators </S>",
    "<S> @xcite demonstrated that all possible double special relativistic constructions differ by a suitable choice of what one defines as an effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> + here we show that the magueijo - smolin transformation ( obtained here in an elementary fashion with the help of simple physical postulates)contains an additional physical constraint on the mass . this transformation can be derived pro - forma from @xmath0-deformed algebra , and the result explicitly shows that in this case the particle mass @xmath79 . to demonstrate that we write the relations of the classical basis ( denoted here as @xmath80 ) by rearranging the formulas given in @xcite :    @xmath81\\equiv ae^{\\overline{\\pi}_0}[1-e^{-\\overline{\\pi}_0}cosh(\\overline{\\mu})]\\ ] ]    @xmath82    where @xmath37 is an arbitrary constant to be determined . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) we immediately see that magueijo - smolin basis follows from @xmath0-deformed algebra if and only if @xmath89 in this case casimir ( [ 22 ] ) reads @xmath90 comparing eq.([26 ] ) with casimir given by eq.([17a ] ) @xcite we arrive at the conclusion that the mass @xmath29 used in the latter is @xmath91    in addition , if we use ( [ add2 ] ) then eq.([27 ] ) imposes the following condition on the value of the rest energy @xmath92 : @xmath93 + at the first glance this condition looks ( predicated on the restriction on particle s mass @xmath94 ) as overly restrictive . on the other hand , considering magueijo - smolin transform as a `` free - standing '' transformations we are not forced to have an upper bound on the rest energy @xmath54 in the planck region where @xmath95 ( that is one half of the upper bound on @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> still , there is a strong argument in favor of adopting the upper bound on particle s mass . </S>",
    "<S> if we would like to be consistent then it seems quite reasonable to expect that all the quantities in the region of planck scales to be bounded from above by planck energy @xmath0 , or bounded from below by planck length @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> + we have derived magueijo - smolin transformation without resorting to group - theoretical approach by simply defining particle velocity @xmath26 , its mass @xmath29 , and the upper bound on the magnitude of momentum - energy @xmath52 in terms of the respective classical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the velocity @xmath26 is defined as @xmath77 ( eq.[3a ] ) . if we substitute into this definition the relations between @xmath96 and the respective quantities @xmath97 , eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 23a ] ) , ( [ 23b ] ) ( used in the conventional treatment based on @xmath0-poincare algebra ) we arrive at the value of the velocity @xmath26 which is exactly the right group velocity @xmath98 ( obeying classical addition law ) introduced in @xcite : @xmath99 interestingly enough , the particle velocity is identical in 2 different bases : magueijo - smolin basis and the basis used in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + to complete our elementary treatment of magueijo - smolin transform , we address its critique expressed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued there that a definition of the particle velocity according to hamilton equations results in a paradoxical situation where @xmath100 particles of different masses moving in an inertial frame with the same velocity will have different velocities when viewed from another inertial frame . </S>",
    "<S> the fallacy of this conclusion is due to the fact that the authors of @xcite used a @xmath101-@xmath102 hamiltonian formalism . + it has been demonstrated ( e.g.,@xcite,@xcite ) that a velocity definition in a non - commutative space is dictated by an appropriate choice of a @xmath102 hamiltonian formalism ( see also @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> to this end let us consider dimensionless relativistic phase space variables @xmath103 normalized by the appropriate planck scales and whose commutation relations are :    @xmath104&=&\\delta_{ij } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\lbrack\\pi_0,\\xi_0\\rbrack & = & -(1-\\pi_0 ) , \\nonumber \\\\ \\lbrack\\pi_0,\\xi_i\\rbrack & = & 0 , \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> @xmath108 if we use this expression in the hamilton s equations ( [ 31a ] ) , ( [ 31b ] ) we obtain : @xmath109 from eqs.([32 ] ) immediately follows the expression for the velocity ( [ 3a ] ) which was postulated from the very beginning : @xmath110 + another seemingly unphysical prediction(s ) of magueijo - smolin ( ms ) basis , as was pointed out by j.rembielinski and k.smolinski @xcite , is connected with an apparent difficulty in formulating statistical mechanics based on ms basis . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that one - particle partition function is divergent when @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> however this conclusion is based on an assumption that the temperature in the planck region is the same as in the classical region . </S>",
    "<S> this is not true , since the existence of the upper limit on the energy immediately implies that there exist a relation between the temperature ( dimensionless ) @xmath112 in the planck region and its counterpart @xmath113 in the classical region analogous to the relations between energies in these two regions , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 11a ] ) . as a result , it is not difficult to demonstrate that the partition function ( expressed as an integral ) does not have singularities . </S>",
    "<S> + additional criticism of @xmath114 transformation is connected to the fact that for a large number @xmath115 of identical particles , each of energy @xmath116 their total internal energy in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath117 ) does not depend on temperature . but this represents not a deficiency of the basis , but on the contrary , its advantage . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , since the temperature is bounded from above by @xmath118 , in the limit of infinite number of particles , whose total energy tends to the respective upper boundary ( @xmath119 ) the respective temperature @xmath120 tend to its maximum that is to 1 , which explains an apparent absence of the dependence of the internal energy on temperature . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the internal energy is simply equal to the temperature , and both are equal to unity ( in the chosen units ) . </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion we would like to say that ms basis following from very simple and consistent physical postulates introduced here represents an attractive model for a description of phenomena which might be associated with planck scale physics . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the imposition of upper bound on the energy - momentum , and even mass ( if we adopt @xmath0-poinciana roots of the basis ) which are in agreement with a major postulate of planck scale phenomena , is the feature which is @xmath121 in any other bases . </S>",
    "<S> still , there are some problems with this ( and to this matter , with any other @xmath0-deformed ) model(s ) . in particular , the commutation relation @xmath122 is not consistent with the well - known string uncertainty relation . </S>"
