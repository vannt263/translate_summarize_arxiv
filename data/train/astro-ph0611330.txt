    "the current picture of galaxies is that they are composed of baryons ( stars , gas , dust ) and non baryonic dark matter . while observationally the distribution of the baryons can be studied , it is difficult to probe how the dark matter is distributed compared to the baryons . traditionally , the study of galaxy dynamics has been the strongest proof of the existence of dark matter in galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . but given the inherent degeneracies in the inversion of dynamical data to obtain density profiles , it is hard to measure how the dark matter is distributed .",
    "another approach is to use gravitational lens systems . for strongly lensed quasars ( qsos ) , the geometry and photometric properties of the lens system",
    "depend on the projected mass inside the lensed qso images and therefore can be used to constrain the mass distribution .    for the particular case of spiral galaxies , generally composed of a bulge , a disk and a dark matter halo",
    ", the rotational velocity curves can not disentangle the relative contributions of the different mass components in the inner ( luminous ) parts of the galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "gravitational lenses offer the possibility of doing so , especially in the case of edge - on spirals .",
    "there are only five spiral gravitational lenses known so far ( b0218 + 357 : @xcite ; pks 1830 - 211 : @xcite ; q2237 + 0305 : @xcite ; b1600 + 434 : @xcite ; pmn j2004 - 1349 : @xcite ) . only one of them is seen edge - on , b1600 + 434 . however , none of them is ideal for studying the relative mass contribution of the different components .    here",

    "october 31 , we took spectra of the x - ray optical counterparts in the cyder d1 field with the ut4 vlt fors2 instrument .",
    "we used the 300v grism which gives a resolution of @xmath18 ( 10.5  ) for our 1  slits .",

    "it is important to know as accurately as possible the position and the fluxes of the observed components . in our images",
    "the seeing is only slightly smaller than the qso images separation .",
    "therefore the overlap between the qso images and the galaxy light distribution makes it hard to separate their relative fluxes and determine their positions .",
    "we have thus used a monte carlo markov chain method ( mcmc ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) to try to determine the positions and fluxes ( and their errors ) of the three components as accurately as possible .",
    "we model the system with three components , two point sources ( qso_a and qso_b ) and a spiral galaxy . each point source",
    "is modeled with three parameters : the @xmath22 and @xmath23 of its center and its flux .",
    "the spiral galaxy is modeled as an elliptical exponential with six parameters : @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the galaxy center , flux , axis ratio , position angle of the major axis and effective radius .",
    "our model thus has 12 parameters .    in order to obtain the best values we generate images with varying values of these 12 parameters and",

    "we ignore the constraints imposed by the third and sometimes fourth images predicted but not seen and the predicted circular velocity of the model .",

    "we fit the qso positions and fluxes allowing only the normalization and characteristic radius of the model ( @xmath73 ) to vary .",
    "we find that a large range of values produce acceptable fits .",
    "the values of the characteristic radius and normalization that produce acceptable fits are degenerate .",
    "the trends in this degeneracy are that , when all other parameters are fixed , the larger the characteristic radius , the lower the normalization and the smaller the radial caustic .",
    "that is , the central concentration of the model dictates the size of the radial caustic .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows a typical configuration of this model .",
    "finally , we model cy2201 - 3201 with an exponential mass component @xcite . the projected surface mass density of this model is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the same as above , @xmath64 is the axis ratio and @xmath76 is the scale radius of the exponential distribution .",
    "we fix the scale radius , the position angle and the axis ratio to the values obtained with the light distribution ( table  [ tab1 ] ) and solve for the normalization that best reproduces the position and fluxes .",
    "the model shows the disk configuration as before and reproduces the position and fluxes of the two qso images fairly well ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "given that the three models produce acceptable fits , one would like to find another constraint to differentiate between them .",
    "comparing the three models , we find that the position and relative magnification of the third image depend on the concentration of the mass models . for the most concentrated model ( sie ) ,",
    "the position of the third image is further away from the galaxy center and the relative magnification compared to the brightest qso image is the lowest ( 30% ) . for the least concentrated model ( exponential ) ,",
    "the position is closer to the galaxy center and the relative magnification is the largest ( 59% ) .",
    "we start with a simple two component model : one sie , as in the previous section , to which we add a single isothermal sphere ( sis ) .",
    "the sis model uses the alpha model of @xcite ( the same as the sie , see above ) in which @xmath77 , the axis ratio @xmath78 , and @xmath79^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "we vary the normalizations of the sis and the sie models , fixing all other parameters , to find the best fitting model for the observed data .",
    "a wide range of normalizations in the models produce acceptable fits to the position and fluxes .",
    "all acceptable fits produce five images of the qso ( the central one strongly de - magnified ) .",
    "only models in which the rotational velocity of the sis is approximately 50% larger than the rotational velocity of the sie do not give acceptable fits .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows an example of an acceptable fit in which both components have similar rotational velocities .",
    "best fits are produced for models with larger sie contribution .",
    "in general when the contribution from the spherical component ( sis ) gets larger in the fits , then the following trends are observed : the area enclosed by the radial caustic increases and the area enclosed by the tangential caustic decreases ; the magnification of the qso images gets larger and the relative magnification of the fourth brightest image compared to the brightest gets larger .",
    "on the other hand , the relative magnification of the third image compared to the brightest is almost independent ( staying around 30% ) of the ratio of the sie and sis contributions .",
    "the fourth and fifth images disappear at almost the point where the sis contribution is negligible and the model is dominated by the sie component .",
    "we next model the system with an expectedly more realistic mass distribution with two components : an exponential distribution ( as in  3.1 ) to account for the disk and a spherical nfw ( same as above but with the axis ratio @xmath78 ) representing the halo .",
    "we search for models that best fit the data , varying the two normalizations and the characteristic scale @xmath73 of the nfw model , and fixing all other parameters . again",
    ", acceptable fits to the positions and fluxes are produced for a wide range of model parameters .",
    "the only models that are rejected are those in which the spherical nfw component dominates .",
    "this occurs when the rotational velocity of the nfw is equal to or 25% larger ( depending on the concentration parameter of the nfw ) than the rotational velocity of the exponential component at 2.7 disk scale radii .",
    "these rejected models produce five images , with the fifth central image strongly demagnified .",
    "the only exception is when the combination of the two mass components is such that the qso needs to be close to the caustic to fit the observed position and fluxes . in this case",
    "the fifth image moves away from the center towards the fourth image in the image plane .",
    "the trends with respect to the relative strengths of the exponential and nfw components are the following : the larger the nfw spherical component , the worse the fit to the positions and the larger the magnification of the qso images .",
    "the relative magnification of the third brightest image compared to the brightest image goes from @xmath8050% when the nfw dominates to @xmath8059% when the exponential dominates .    if we model the halos with some ellipticity , the results present general trends that are between the previous one mass component and two mass components cases discussed .",
    "the most significant difference in the case of an exponential plus elliptical nfw model is the magnification of the resulting images .",
    "the total magnification of the qso images is in general lower and the relative magnification of the third image compared to the brightest becomes larger than in the previous cases .      in the previous section we restricted ourselves to modeling the system taking into account the positions and fluxes of the two observed qso images as constraints .",
    "we have also measured the rotational velocity of the lens galaxy and can use it as an additional constraint .    for each model",
    "we compute the rotational velocity predicted at 2.7 @xmath44 , where @xmath44 is the scale radius of the exponential distribution of the galaxy light .",
    "this is the value of the radius for which we can measure the rotational velocity with our spectroscopic data ( see  2.5 ) .",
    "all rotational velocity comparisons are performed at this radius , neglecting the rotational velocity dependence with radius .",
    "for the one mass component models , the best fitting sie model to the qso image positions and fluxes predicts a lower rotational velocity than observed , but consistent within the 1 @xmath81 error .",
    "the exponential and elliptical nfw models predict larger rotational velocities than observed , which are consistent only at the 2 @xmath81 level .",
    "if we include the rotational velocity in the overall minimization of the two component models , we find that for the sie+sis model the best fit occurs when the rotational velocities of the sis is approximately 20% lower than the rotational velocity of the sie .",
    "unacceptable models happen when the rotational velocity of the sis is @xmath80 5% larger than the rotational velocity of the sie .",
    "for the exponential+nfw case , we do not find acceptable models that satisfy the three constraints : positions and fluxes of the qso images and rotational velocity of the galaxy .",
    "the general trend is that the larger the relative contribution of the spherical component ( halo ) , the lower the rotational velocity predicted to fit the positions and fluxes .",
    "cy 2201 - 3201 is an edge - on galaxy lens .",
    "such systems offer the possibility of decomposing the relative mass contributions of the disk , bulge and halo . in our optical images",
    "cy 2201 - 3201 appears as a bulgeless edge - on spiral galaxy , producing two images of a background @xmath1 qso .",
    "we have therefore modeled the system with one ( disk ) and two ( disk+halo ) mass components , neglecting the bulge .    all viable models explored",
    "produce either three or four visible images . however , our optical images only show two images of the qso ( fig  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we observe the two images that are farther away from the disk but miss the third ( and in some configurations the fourth ) image located very close to the disk .",
    "we have investigated whether dust extinction could be responsible for this missing image .",
    "the colors of the qso images a and b ( table  [ tab2 ] ) are in fact redder than expected for a typical qso at that redshift .",
    "although low in signal - to - noise ratioand covering a small wavelength range , the qso spectrum does not reveal indication of strong intrinsic absorption in the qso itself .",
    "one is then led to conclude that the redder colors are due to dust extinction between the qso and the observer .",
    "the most probable source of attenuation comes from the disk itself .",
    "we have computed the amount of dust extinction at the galaxy redshift ( @xmath82 ) necessary to explain the observed colors assuming a mean qso spectrum at this redshift , no intrinsic absorption at the qso itself and the value of the local galactic extinction @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "we find that the qso image a requires an extinction by the galaxy disk of @xmath84 and the image b an extinction of @xmath85 .",
    "images a and b are seen at a projected distance of 0.35  and 0.47  ( 1.7 and 2.2 @xmath86 kpc ) of the disk plane respectively .",
    "the inferred values of the extinction by the disk are then likely taking into account thee projected distances to the disk .",
    "our @xmath21 band image is the one with the highest signal - to - noise detection of the qso images .",
    "we have inserted a third image of the qso in our model images at the position given by our lens models and verify through our mcmc method the maximum flux it could have without being significantly detected .",
    "if the ratio of expected flux to maximum observed flux are completely due to absorption by dust at the lens galaxy , then there are at least 3 mag of extinction more at the position of the third image than at the brightest . taking into account the possible extinction at the brightest image , the third image would suffer @xmath87 of extinction going through the lens galaxy .    in our models of the lens ,",
    "we have first explored the assumption that the mass distribution has the same ellipticity as the light . we have tried three one - mass component models fixing the galaxy center , axis ratio and position angle to those observed in the optical .",
    "we have fit an sie , an exponential and an nfw model .",
    "all three models reproduce the two qso images and predict a third image that is unobserved .",
    "the predicted rotational velocities are consistent with the observed value at the 1 @xmath81 level for the sie model and at the 2 @xmath81 level for the exponential and elliptical nfw models .",
    "we have also tried other methods to estimate the galaxy mass .",
    "we have fit the observed galaxy photometry with the pegase synthesis evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "we obtain an absolute magnitude of @xmath88 , adding an evolutionary correction . ] which is a factor 3 fainter than l@xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratio(@xmath90/@xmath91 ) of the best fitting model is @xmath92 , so its stellar mass would be @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 . the expected rotational velocity for such a mass at 2.7 times the scale radius is @xmath96 km s@xmath3 ( depending on the mass model ) . the stellar mass by itself is thus insufficient to produce the observed ( or predicted ) rotational velocity .",
    "if we assume the local tully - fisher relation @xcite neglecting evolution and the measured absolute magnitude , we obtain a value for the expected rotational velocity of @xmath97 km s@xmath3 , which is consistent with the measured rotational velocity .",
    "we have also studied more realistic models .",
    "the galaxy does not appear to have a bulge in the optical images , and therefore we have modelled the system with two mass components : one for the disk and one for the halo .",
    "we have tried an sie+sis model and an exponential+nfw model .",
    "these models reproduce the positions and fluxes of the two observed qso images . however , the sie+sis model predicts four visible images and the best fitting exponential+nfw predicts three visible images .",
    "none of these predicted additional images are seen in our images ( see above ) .",
    "we measure a rotational velocity of @xmath2 km s@xmath3 at 2.7 disk scale radius for the lens galaxy .",
    "the sie+sis model predicts values of the rotational velocity consistent with this value for certain combinations of the relative contributions of the sie and sis components ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "however , the exponential+nfw model predicts higher values of the rotational velocity if we fit the observed position and fluxes of the qso images .",
    "our magellan spectroscopic data were obtained on three different nights with two different settings . as explained in  2.5 , we have four sets of same night / grating data .",
    "the individual fits to the rotational velocity at 2.7@xmath44 for each set of data are @xmath98 , @xmath99,@xmath100 , and @xmath101 ( low - resolution september 7 , low - resolution september 9 , high - resolution september 7 and high - resolution september 8 , respectively ) .",
    "the relative dispersion of these values may hint at a possible underestimation of the errors .",
    "it this were the case , the range of allowed @xmath46 values would be larger and the exponential+nfw model prediction would still be viable .",
    "we have also explored other effects that can affect our modeling .",
    "our system is likely to be influenced by some external shear which will contribute to the image separation but not to the rotational velocity of the lens galaxy .",
    "in fact , cy2201 - 3201 lies 7 away from the hickson compact group hcg 90 .",
    "we have computed what would be the external shear produced by the group assuming it is modeled with a sie with the same velocity dispersion as measured from the galaxy members .",
    "hcg 90 is relatively small and the external shear induced in the cy 2201 - 3201 system is negligible for our purposes .",
    "apart from hcg 90 , cy 2201 - 3201 appears to be isolated and not in any group , cluster , or obvious large - scale structure .",
    "in fact , as part of the cyder survey we have obtained spectra of several sources in the field and , with the limited spectroscopic data we have , not found any sign of a massive structure .    another possible flaw in our modeling",
    "could be that the galaxy center is miscalculated .",
    "if the galaxy center is much closer to the qso images than the position we have measured then most of the discussed configurations would no longer apply and the system would display other image configurations , which can in fact place tighter constraints on the relative contribution of the halo and disk to the total mass budget in the central regions of the lens galaxy .",
    "however , the seeing and pixel size of our images and the consistency of the galaxy center in our different filter images make us believe that the true center if different from the one measured should not be very far off .",
    "we have presented the discovery and subsequent follow up observations of the cy2201 - 3201 system composed of an edge - on spiral at @xmath82 splitting a background @xmath102 qso into two observed images each at opposite sides of the disk .",
    "we have modeled the system with one ( disk ) and two ( disk+halo ) mass components .",
    "the most likely configuration is the `` disk''configuration with three images of the qso one at each side of the disk and the fainter one approximately behind the disk .",
    "there are also possible configurations that produce four or even five ( this one unlikely ) observable images .",
    "however we only observe two images .",
    "we have discussed the possibility that the third ( and fourth , if existent ) image is extincted by the disk .",
    "we estimate that an @xmath87 at th epredicted position of the third image at the galaxy lens redshift is required to be consistent with our observations .",
    "we have measured the rotational velocity of the lens galaxy to be @xmath103 km s@xmath3 at a radius 2.7 times the scale radius of the galaxy exponential light distribution .",
    "if we use an sie+sis model to fit the qso image positions and fluxes and this value of the rotational velocity , we find that the contribution by the sie ( disk ) to the @xmath46 at this radius is required to be the same or larger than the contribution of the sis ( halo ) .",
    "if we use an exponential+nfw model then we are unable to reproduce this value of the rotational velocity if we fit the positions and fluxes of the qso images .",
    "we have speculated whether we have underestimated the error in our determination of the @xmath46 which would make the exponential+nfw model viable .",
    "cy 2201 - 3201 is the best lensing spiral galaxy known to date that can be used to disentangle the contributions of its different mass components .",
    "unfortunately our current follow up observations are not constraining enough to elucidate between different possible models .",
    "more accurate image source positions , the discovery or not of the predicted third image and the measurement of its properties and a precise rotational velocity would make this system fulfill its potential .",
    "cy 2201 - 3201 has been awarded _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) acs time in cycle 13 .",
    "we have also been awarded more spectroscopic time at magellan .",
    "we expect that the higher quality images and extra spectra will help us improve our modeling and place strong constraints on the relative contribution of the disk and halo mass components .",

    "<S> we also measure the rotational velocity of the galaxy at 2.7 disk scale radius to be @xmath2 km s@xmath3 from the [ oii ] emission lines . when adding the rotational velocity constraint to the models , we find that the contribution to the rotational velocity of the disk is likely to be equal to or larger than the contribution of the halo at this radius . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of the third image and a more accurate measurement of the rotational velocity would help to set tighter constraints on the mass distribution of this edge - on spiral galaxy . </S>"
