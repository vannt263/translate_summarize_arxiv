    "with the discovery of parity ( @xmath3 ) violation , which was suggested by lee and yang  @xcite , landau  @xcite deduced that charge conjugation and parity ( @xmath4 ) invariance implies that the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of particles , _",
    "e.g. _ the neutron , should be zero .",
    "if the @xmath5 theorem is valid , which is the case for gauge theories , then any @xmath4 violation would also imply a corresponding time reversal ( @xmath6 ) invariance violation . predating the discovery of parity violation in the weak interaction , purcell and",
    "ramsey  @xcite had pointed out that there was lacking any experimental test of parity conservation in the strong interaction . with their student smith  @xcite they set limits on the edm of the neutron of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "the standard model of fundamental interactions predicts values for edms ( due to second order w boson exchange ) which are significantly smaller than contemporary experiments can detect , of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , an unambiguous observation of a nonzero edm at current capabilities would imply a yet to be discovered source of @xmath4 violation  @xcite . the new physics could arise in the strong interaction sector ( _ e.g. _ , the @xmath9 term ) , or in the weak interaction sector [ _ e.g. _ , super symmetric models or left / right ( boson mass ) symmetry breaking ] .",
    "current limits on the nucleon edm are of the order of @xmath10 . even were one to establish a nonzero neutron and proton edm , those two results would at best determine the isoscalar and isotensor components but would not isolate any isovector component .",
    "thus , one would need a third measurement , such as the deuteron edm , to fully elucidate the isospin nature of the edm operator . both @xmath11 violating and @xmath3 conserving",
    ", @xmath6 violating potentials may give rise to an edm  @xcite , but one - pion exchange contributes only to the former .",
    "we concentrate here upon the effects due to @xmath11 invariance violation in the nuclear potential .",
    "the deuteron is attractive as the focus of an edm investigation , both theoretically and experimentally , because a method has been proposed to directly measure the edm of charged ions in a storage ring  @xcite .",
    "a permanent edm can arise because a @xmath11 violating interaction can induce a small p - state admixture in the deuteron wave function , one which produces a non vanishing matrix element of the charge dipole operator @xmath12 .",
    "although this two - body edm contribution must be disentangled from the one - body contributions of the neutron and proton , the neutron and proton edms tend to cancel in the case of the isospin zero @xmath2h .",
    "( if the nucleon edm were a pure isoscalar as is the case in the @xmath9 model , then this cancellation would be exact . ) therefore , the @xmath11 violating nucleon - nucleon ( _ nn _ ) interaction can contribute significantly to the deuteron edm . because the deuteron is reasonably understood and has been accurately modeled , reliable calculations are possible .",
    "our purpose is to address the sensitivity of the deuteron edm to the nuclear physics in the modeling of the nucleon - nucleon interaction . beyond understanding the model dependence of the @xmath2h edm ,",
    "our goal is to determine an appropriate model approximation with which one might reliably calculate the nuclear physics contribution to the @xmath0he and @xmath0h edms .",
    "therefore , we examine the uncertainties in the deuteron edm calculation arising from the short range repulsion in the ground state wave function , the dependence on the size of the deuteron d - state , and the properties of the @xmath0p@xmath1 continuum in intermediate states .    for the purpose of completeness and to place our work in context , we note that avishai  @xcite first estimated the two - body deuteron edm [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) ] @xmath13 using a separable potential model due to mongan  @xcite .",
    "he reported a value of @xmath14 when he utilized the physical pion mass for the exchanged meson .",
    "[ note : to exclude the @xmath11 violating and strong coupling constants in the one pion exchange nucleon - nucleon interaction for the quoted values of the edm , we have introduced @xmath15 .",
    "] however , there is an ambiguity in avishai s results , in that he states his final result in terms of @xmath16 . because the particular separable potentials used by avishai were not specified , we were unable to fully confirm his reported numbers .",
    "khriplovich and korkin  @xcite later estimated @xmath13 using a zero - range approximation in the chiral limit ( @xmath17 ) and obtained a value of @xmath18 .",
    "this result does not depend upon the @xmath0p@xmath1 interaction and should , therefore , be directly comparable to our ` plane wave ' result .",
    "finally , using the argonne and nijmegen contemporary realistic potential models a@xmath19 , reid93 , and nijm ii  @xcite liu and timmermans  @xcite obtained for the polarization component of the two - body contribution to the deuteron edm @xmath13 values of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "these relatively model - independent results suggest that pion exchange is indeed the essential aspect of the model .",
    "the differing degree of softness of the three potentials at intermediate range correlates with the values for @xmath13 , the nijm ii potential being the softest and producing the largest edm .",
    "the important conclusion for our purpose is that all three models yield essentially the same result ; within the range of uncertainty defined by the three models utilized , the value of the polarization component of @xmath13 can be said to be @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , liu and timmermans estimated that the meson exchange current contribution was substantially smaller , calculated to be less than 5% of the potential model contribution . in any case , our goal is to determine an appropriately simple model with which one can calculate reliably the @xmath2h , @xmath0he , and @xmath0h edms , so that our numerical comparisons will be made with the @xmath24 value .",
    "the total one - body contribution @xmath25 to the deuteron edm due to the neutron and proton is the sum of the individual nucleon edms : @xmath26 whereas the total deuteron edm is the sum of this one - body contribution and the two - body contribution @xmath13 , @xmath27 as has been noted , the neutron and proton edms can arise from a variety of sources . because we have nothing new to add to prior analyses of the nucleon edm",
    ", we adopt the approach advanced by liu and timmermans  @xcite : @xmath28 which is expressed in terms of @xmath29 , the product of the strong coupling constant @xmath30 and the associated @xmath11 violating meson - nucleon coupling constant @xmath31 .",
    "( for example , @xmath32 . )",
    "as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contributions from the neutron and proton edms have a sizable theoretical uncertainty , but the significant cancellation between @xmath33 and @xmath34 is clear . for the two - body contribution to @xmath13",
    "the mean value obtained by liu and timmermans can be expressed as @xmath35 this corresponds to the edm value of @xmath21 .",
    "hence , for the deuteron there can be little doubt that the nuclear physics contribution to @xmath13 dominates .",
    "even an uncertainty of 50% in @xmath25 contributes only in a minor way .",
    "it is the nuclear model aspects of the @xmath13 dominant term in the @xmath2h edm that we investigate below in detail .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for the ground state of the system consists of two components : ( i )  the strong interaction component @xmath36 based on nucleon - nucleon potentials with parameters adjusted to fit the experimental phase shifts .",
    "( ii )  the @xmath11 violating component @xmath37 which we parametrize in terms of one pion exchange ( ope ) with one strong interaction vertex @xmath38 and a @xmath11 violating vertex @xmath39 . as a result",
    "our hamiltonian takes the form @xmath40 because @xmath41 will mix different parity states , i.e. , for the deuteron we get coupling between the @xmath0s@xmath1-@xmath0d@xmath1 large component and the @xmath0p@xmath1 small component , we can write the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) @xmath42 as a set of coupled equations of the form @xmath43 where the total wave function is the sum of the large and small components : @xmath44 .    because @xmath45 , we have that @xmath46 , and we can , to a good approximation , write eq .  ( [ eq:7 ] ) as @xmath47 which is the scrdinger equation for the ground state of the system in the absence of the @xmath11 violating interaction . on the other hand , the small component of the wave function @xmath48 is given by the solution of eq .",

    "we can write the two - body deuteron edm ( @xmath13 ) in terms of the total ground state wave function @xmath53 as @xmath54 where the matrix element of the dipole operator between the small and large component of the wave function can be written in terms of the charge @xmath55 and the constant @xmath56 as @xmath57\\,a \\quad\\mbox{with}\\quad   a\\equiv\\frac{\\bar{g}^{(1)}_{\\pi nn}\\,g_{\\pi nn}}{16\\pi}\\ .\\label{eq:14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq.([eq:13 ] ) the first term on the right hand side ( rhs ) involves a complete set of intermediate plane wave states and is , up to a constant , the ` plane wave ' contribution @xmath58 .",
    "the second term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) involves multiple scattering via the amplitude @xmath49 and is the ` multiple scattering ' contribution @xmath59 .",
    "one should note that @xmath60 is the ground state energy , and as a result we need the amplitude @xmath49 at an unphysical point corresponding to the @xmath2h bound state energy .",
    "the primary motivation for the present investigation is : ( i )  to determine the sensitivity of @xmath13 to properties of the deuteron , _",
    "e.g. _ the @xmath61-state probability and the short range behavior of the deuteron wave function .",
    "( ii )  to determine the relative importance of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this will suggest the significance of multiple scattering terms as one proceeds to heavier nuclei .",
    "( iii )  the role of the @xmath0p@xmath1 interaction in determining the magnitude of @xmath59 and therefore the appropriateness of the @xmath58 approximation in heavier nuclei .",
    "before we proceed to illustrate the sensitivity of the deuteron edm to nuclear structure effects due to the nuclear interaction , we should detail our choice of nucleon - nucleon interactions and their fit to those aspects of the two - body data relevant to the determination of the edm .",
    "the input two - body interactions consists of : ( i )  the @xmath11 violating one pion exchange potential .",
    "( ii )  the deuteron wave function in the absence of the @xmath11 violating interaction .",
    "( iii )  the @xmath0p@xmath1 interaction that couples to the deuteron @xmath0s@xmath1-@xmath0d@xmath1 potential as a result of the introduction of the @xmath11 violating potential .",
    "the choice of these interactions is motivated by the questions raised regarding the sensitivity of the edm to nuclear structure effects and the hope of extending the analysis to @xmath0h and @xmath0he using the @xmath58 approximation .    for the @xmath11 violating interaction",
    "we have chosen the standard isovector one - pion exchange given by  @xcite @xmath62\\,f(r)\\ , \\label{eq:15}\\ ] ] where the radial dependence is given by @xmath63 with @xmath64 being the pion mass .",
    "here we have combined the strength of the strong and @xmath11 violating vertices in the constant @xmath56 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to express the numerical value of the edm in terms of @xmath65 with @xmath55 the charge on the proton . finally , the spin and isospin operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) are given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the strong @xmath0s@xmath1-@xmath0d@xmath1 interaction basically defines the deuteron wave function .",
    "here we resort to a separable representation of the interaction to simplify the computation when we proceed to the edm for the three - nucleon system . as a result",
    "the partial wave expansion of the strong interaction in momentum space is written as @xmath68 with @xmath69 eigenstates of the orbital angular momentum @xmath70 , spin @xmath71 , total angular momentum @xmath72 and isospin @xmath73 .",
    "the separability of the potential is defined by the requirement that @xmath74 where @xmath75 . here",
    "we wish to examine the role of the @xmath61-state probability and short range nature of the nucleon - nucleon interaction . for",
    "that we consider two classes of interactions : ( i )  the yamaguchi and yamaguchi  ( yy )  @xcite separable potential with 4% and 7% @xmath61-state probability .",
    "each has a different @xmath61-state probability and no short range repulsion .",
    "( ii )  the unitary pole approximation  ( upa )  @xcite to the original reid soft core potential ( reid68 )  @xcite and the nijmegen modified reid potential ( reid93 )  @xcite .",
    "the upa potential by definition generates the same deuteron wave function as the original potential  @xcite that provided the optimum fit to the available data at the time the potentials were constructed and includes short range repulsion . in addition the models have different @xmath61-state probabilities for the deuteron .    for the yamaguchi and yamaguchi potentials  @xcite the form factor @xmath76",
    "is given by @xmath77 where the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 are detailed in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "also included in this table are the binding energy @xmath80 and the quadrupole moment @xmath81 for these two potentials .",
    ".parameters for the yamaguchi - yamaguchi potentials  @xcite with 4% and 7% @xmath61-state probability for the deuteron . also included are the binding energy and quadrupole moments . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally",
    ", the results in table  [ table9 ] for @xmath82 and @xmath83 indicate that the contribution from the @xmath61-wave component of the deuteron wave function are an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath71-wave component .",
    "this may suggest that one could neglect the @xmath61-wave component in the calculating @xmath59 and a simplification of the calculation of the multiple scattering term in heavier nuclei .",
    "this observation is consistent with the results in table  [ table6 ] where the changes in the multiple scattering contribution has a variation of about 10% with @xmath61-state probability .",
    "from our analysis we offer the following conclusions : ( i )  in the absence of multiple scattering ( @xmath84 ) the variation in @xmath85 due to differences in the deuteron wave functions is less than 5% , and the value of @xmath58 is consistent with the zero range ( chiral limit ) results of khriplovich and korkin  @xcite .",
    "( ii )  the contribution from multiple scattering @xmath59 is sensitive to the short range behavior of the deuteron wave function , and the @xmath59 contribution is about 20% for realistic parametrizations of the deuteron such as those represented by the reid93 potential model .",
    "this suggests that we can extend the analysis to heavier nuclei in the plane wave approximation with an estimated error of @xmath86% .",
    "( iii ) as suggested by liu and timmermans , one pion exchange dominates the deuteron edm calculation .",
    "( iv )  the contribution from the @xmath0p@xmath1 interaction via @xmath59 depends on the phase shifts in this channel as well as the off - shell behavior of the amplitude . ( v )  a comparison of our reid93 results with those of liu and timmermans  @xcite indicates that one can use a separable potential approximation in heavier nuclei , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath0he and @xmath0h , with minimal loss in accuracy . moreover",
