    "the sample was made by exfoliating graphene from natural indian graphite procured from ngs naturgraphit gmbh .",
    "it was deposited by the standard scotch tape procedure on a 290 nm thick layer of thermal sio@xmath74 commercially grown on an insulating si wafer of room temperature resistivity @xmath75k@xmath70-cm .",
    "the wafer was prepared in a piranha solution ( @xmath76 ) followed by an oxygen plasma etch .",
    "spurious grains of graphite were removed with high pressure oxygen plasma etching , during which the graphene was protected with a pmma / hsq mask .",
    "the coplanar waveguide ( cpwg ) conductors of ti(5nm)/au(200 nm ) were then deposited by evaporation in high vacuum through an electron beam patterned pmma mask .",
    "the central conductors extend onto the edge of the graphene by about 2@xmath38 m as seen in the photo of fig.1(a ) of the main text . after liftoff",
    "the graphene sample was characterised with scanning micro - raman spectroscopy ( see figure [ raman ] ) with a 532 nm wavelength laser and found to be a monolayer with low impurity content .",
    "the wafer was cut into a @xmath77mm@xmath78 flip chip so as to leave the sample centrally placed and for the on chip cpwg to make contact with the cpwg of the microwave printed circuit board ( pcb ) .",
    "the sample was mounted perpendicular to the ( vertical ) field axis in a hermetic insert made for the bore of the 19 t superconducting magnet .",
    "the magnet was cooled in a @xmath79he cryostat with lambda plate cooling of the coil region to @xmath80k .",
    "the sample was annealed by heating its holder to @xmath81c for two hours while maintaining a cryogenic vacuum with the cold 4.2k walls of the insert .",
    "transmission measurements of @xmath82 as a function of field at a few ghz allowed us to estimate the electronic density to be about @xmath83@xmath36 .",
    "we designed the microwave circuit to and from the sample to have 50ghz bandwidth with the help of cst microwave studio software .",
    "two coaxial cryogenic cables connect two v - connector hermetic feed - throughs from the top of the insert cryostat to the horizontal sample holder pcb assembly _ via _ mini - smp right angle connectors modified to have less dielectric to ensure reduced reflection and with a bent central conductor to make solderless connections to the tapered coplanar waveguides ( cpwg ) .",
    "the waveguides are etched onto a 17 @xmath38 m thick gold - on - copper face of a tmm10 substrate pcb with a dense array of via holes .",
    "the waveguides terminate at contact pads on adjacent edges of a @xmath84mm@xmath78 square hole over which is placed the @xmath77mm@xmath78 chip from an undoped si wafer containing the graphene sample .",
    "we used undoped si to limit dielectric losses . the `` flip chip '' , so called because it is mounted face down on the pcb to ensure contact between its own cpwg and those of the pcb , contains sample specific tapered waveguides which terminate at the graphene in either an ohmic or capacitive contact .",
    "the flip - chip is held in place by an optically flat metallic backing plate attached to a bent beam spring of vespel plastic .",
    "all contacts to the pcb are solderless to resist the high 450 - 500k temperatures required for annealing , care being taken to ensure sufficient elasticity of the contacts to compensate thermal contraction .",
    "the frequency - dependent loss in the pcb and flip - chip cpwg was measured by the transmission coefficient @xmath82 between the two mini - smp connectors with a continuous cpwg on the flipchip .",
    "it has a linear baseline with small oscillations in frequency , and is about -7db at 50ghz .",

    "the details of the microwave setup will be published elsewhere .",
    "the derivative with respect to field of the arrival signal is illustrated by the rainbow colour plot in figure [ dsdb ] which is obtained by subtracting consecutive 0.33 t interval direct ( unmodulated ) transmission signals .",
    "the propagation times deduced from the analysis of the derivative with respect to gate voltage ( figure 3 in the main text ) have been superimposed to facilitate comparison from which we conclude that the derivative in field gives similar pulse propagation times to those obtained from the derivative with respect to gate voltage . however , unlike the gate voltage modulated signal , the field derivative is more subject to experimental drift as the difference is made between acquisitions separated by long times and shows inferior signal to noise .",
    "below we derive the ac response of a graphene sample in the idealized case of perfectly transmitting edge channels and assuming that , at a given filling factor , all the chiral edge channels running in parallel propagate with the same velocity .",
    "the aim is to understand the effect of a perfect ohmic contact connected to an external circuit of negligible impedance on the chiral emp propagation .",
    "does it fully absorb the emp chiral wave ?",
    "how is the pulse response modified when the magnetic field is reversed ?    to model the ac response , we start from the gauge invariant , current conserving approach developed in @xcite which is particularly appropriate for chiral quantum hall edge channels .",
    "we first derive the ac conductance for two simple situations : the case of two ohmic contacts and the case of one ohmic and one capacitive contact .",
    "the results of @xcite are valid in the low frequency limit where the long range interaction can be simply taken into account by introducing capacitances to ground . in the second part",
    ", we extend our analysis to include the high frequency regime relevant to edge magneto - plasmons by adapting the approach of @xcite for a 1d wire with short range interactions to the chiral case .",
    "the assumption of chirality leads to a dispersion relation for the magneto - plasmon mode where the electron drift velocity simply adds to the plasmon velocity with short range interactions .",
    "generalization to long range interactions would lead directly to eq.(1 ) of the main text .",
    "regarding the ac current response to a voltage pulse , our calculation shows that the only relevant modification due to interactions is to change the propagation velocity , while the absorptive condition of the contact remains unchanged .",
    "in particular the existence of at least one ohmic contact is shown to prevent the formation of pulse echoes and would seem responsible for our observing only a single pulse in the current response .",
    "we first consider the case of two ohmic contacts as shown in figure [ figs1 ] .",
    "the lengths of the filling factor @xmath3 chiral edge states connecting contacts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in the limit where one can linearize the electron dispersion relation around the chemical potential of the edges , the ac transport kirchhoff s laws relating the ac current @xmath87 at the input of contact @xmath88 to the ac voltage @xmath89 applied on contact @xmath90 are @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the temporal phase , @xmath96 the frequency , and @xmath72 the carrier drift velocity . in the above set of equations the terms @xmath97 have to be replaced by @xmath98 in the limit of small @xmath96 . in this limit",

    "are invariant under a global shift of all potentials by a common quantity @xmath104 and they show current conservation as they include the displacement currents @xmath105 and @xmath106 .    in the absence of backscattering between upper and lower edges , the dynamics of each edge are decoupled .",
    "if the two contacts are not equally spaced along the perimeter , as is intentionally the case for our graphene sample , i.e. @xmath107 , the ac response of the current is expected to change under magnetic field reversal . as an example",
    ", we take @xmath108 while @xmath109 and look at the current response @xmath110 .",
    "this would correspond experimentally to the situation where the input transmission line is connected to contact ( 1 ) and the output transmission line to contact ( 2 ) and the finite characteristic impedance of the transmission line @xmath111 is neglected with respect to @xmath112 ( several k@xmath70 ) . to first order in @xmath96 @xmath113 reversing the sign of the magnetic field , and therefore the direction of propagation ,",
    "leads to a similar expression but with index ( 3 ) replaced by the index ( 4 ) . thus , unless the upper and lower lengths are equal , @xmath114 @xcite . because of the displacement currents , the @xmath115 parity imposed by the onsager - casimir relations for two - terminal samples no longer holds at finite frequency .    in the limit of infinite geometrical capacitances",

    "we now consider the case where contact ( 2 ) is so resistive that it can be replaced by a small but finite capacitance @xmath124 connected to the output of the transmission line ( figure [ figs2 ] ) .",
    "the non - interacting limit is treated by setting the geometrical capacitances @xmath125 and @xmath126 to be infinite",
    ". the very short capacitive contact length ( few @xmath38 m ) can be represented by a quantum capacitance @xmath127 in series with @xmath124 , small enough to be in the regime where @xmath128 ( @xmath129 few ps ) .",
    "following @xcite the problem of the current @xmath110 response to an ac voltage @xmath130 can be replaced by an equivalent problem where the internal potential @xmath104 in the sample is , according to gauge invariance , subtracted off all potentials , as in the lower part of figure [ figs2 ] .",
    "let @xmath131 be the current at the input of the capacitive contact , and @xmath132 the current at the output of the contact .",
    "@xmath133 is the temporal phase accumulated by the current emitted by contact ( 1 ) up to the entrance of the capacitive contact and @xmath134 the temporal phase accumulated within the capacitive contact .",
    "we have @xmath135 for @xmath128 , we find the impedance @xmath136 for @xmath137 we recover the expression of the mesoscopic capacitor impedance of @xcite , where @xmath138 . for small @xmath96 and large @xmath124 we have @xmath139 .",
    "we expect the dominant part of the pulse response to be the derivative of the step function pulse emitted by the generator used in the tdr mode .",
    "we now introduce coulomb interactions in the short range limit .",
    "we start with the simple case of two perfect ohmic contacts just as above in section _ i_. the problem being chiral , in the absence of backscattering we expect the upper and lower edge dynamics to be fully decoupled .",
    "we follow the approach used in @xcite for modeling the ac response of a ( non - chiral ) 1d interacting wire .",
    "this approach treats the wire , or tomonaga - luttinger liquid , not in the framework of the bosonization technique but in the self - consistent random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the coulomb interaction is taken to be short - range .",
    "this is realized by assuming a capacitor placed very close to the electrons , see figure [ figs3 ] .",
    "the interaction becomes local with ac potential @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the local charge density and @xmath142 is the capacitance per unit length defined by the wire and the screening gate .",
    "the difference with respect to the non - chiral case enters in the polarization kernel @xmath143 . for the upper edge , the last right hand term of eq .",
    "( 4 ) in @xcite , @xmath144 , is here replaced by @xmath145 for @xmath146 and by @xmath147 for @xmath148 as a result of chirality .",
    "here we use the notation @xmath149 where the drift velocity replaces the fermi velocity used for the non - chiral case .",
    "@xmath150 is the one - dimensional density of states with @xmath151 the quantum capacitance per unit length of the upper edge .",
    "similar definitions hold for the lower edge .",
    "the solution of the self consistent equations for the propagation of the potential or the charge density along the upper edge is sought in the form of @xmath152 ( while both components @xmath153 are necessarily present in the non - chiral case ) .",
    "we find @xmath154 . as a result ,",
    "the phase velocity of the , now collective , excitation describing the charge propagation becomes        coming back to the problem of the current at contact ( 2 ) in response to the ac voltage applied at contact ( 1 ) , the only modification to the expression obtained in section _",
    "i _ is to replace the drift velocity by the velocity @xmath157 .",
    "specifically , in the notation of figure [ figs1 ] , we take @xmath158 and @xmath159 , such that the two edges are decoupled .",
    "we find          we see that this is the same solution as the one given by equations ( 1 - 3 ) with @xmath121 replaced by @xmath163 . adding the contribution of a finite @xmath164 and @xmath165 , a set of equations identical to eq.(1 - 4 ) is recovered with @xmath99 replaced by @xmath166 ( indeed , the geometrical capacitances are already taken into account by the short range interaction which renormalizes the propagation velocity ) .",
    "the main consequence for the pulse response is that the role of the ohmic contact is the same as in the non - interacting case . despite the strong change in the dynamics of the current propagation , full absorption of the pulse",
    "is expected if at least one ohmic contact is present .",
    "this prevents the pulses from making several turns along the sample edge and no echo is expected , as is presently the case in our experiment ."

    "<S> another is the unique pulse response at fixed field orientation indicating that only a single path is taken and no counter - propagating mode is detected . </S>",

    "<S> is presented in supplemental material .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> graphene emp differ from their inertial gapped 2des counterparts not by the basic form of the dispersion relation but by the effect of the hard edge and gapless relativistic dynamics on the drift velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we identify them in graphene by observing chirality , quantization of velocity and low attenuation . </S>",
    "<S> we see no evidence of counter - propagating states under our experimental conditions , but these are far from the neutrality point for which such modes were proposed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the emp propagation velocity exceeds the fermi velocity , affirming the collective nature of the excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the carrier drift component @xmath72 is less , but comparable , to the fermi velocity , in keeping with gapless , massless particle behaviour at a sharp edge . </S>",
    "<S> the fit to a characteristic length of 500 nm in the edge coulomb interaction is one order of magnitude smaller than observed in soft edged gaas@xcite but it is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the magnetic length . </S>",
    "<S> although this could reflect lateral charge distribution , it could also result from the oversimplified model which does not take into account the divergence of the edge density profile or electrostatic screening by the compressible strip .    </S>",
    "<S> for use in plasmonics , bulk plasmons in graphene offer great advantages over metals in being electrically tunable and in having long relaxation times @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> edge magneto - plasmons offer further features over bulk plasmons : they are @xmath73 less damped , they are chiral with chirality determined by gate voltage sign and the propagation velocity is linearly rather fourth root dependent on gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> graphene emp could extend considerably the frequency domain of graphene based plasmonics and open up a whole new domain of chiral plasmonics .    </S>",
    "<S> in the course of completing the work reported here , we became aware of similar work on emp propagation in mm size samples of graphene on sic involving ns rather than ps propagation times@xcite .    </S>",
