    "developing a theory for the non - equilibrium  electronic quantum transport through nanoscale junctions is a challenging task , especially when thinking in terms of applications for nanoscale electronics .",
    "electronic transport through nanojunctions ( single - molecule junctions , for example ) exhibits many important new features in comparison with conduction through macroscopic systems .",
    "this leads to promising new applications in single - molecule electronics .",
    "in particular , interactions such as coulomb interactions between the electrons and scattering from localized atomic vibrations are critically important .    having a simple expression for the current ( or the conductance ) of a nanoscale object connected to terminals is most useful .",
    "this is provided by the landauer formula @xcite which describes the current in terms of local properties ( transmission coefficients ) of a finite central region @xmath0 and the distribution functions of the electron reservoirs connected to this region @xmath0 . however , the original landauer formulation deals only with non - interacting electrons .",
    "it has been used with success in conjunction with density - functional theory calculations for realistic nanoscale systems @xcite since dft maps the many - electron interacting system onto an effective single - particle problem .",
    "however there are many cases when such a single - particle approach becomes questionable @xcite .",
    "the landauer formula has been built upon by meir and wingreen @xcite to extend the formalism to a central scattering region containing interactions by using the non - equilibrium green s functions formalism .",
    "other generalizations of landauer - like approaches to include interactions and inelastic scattering in the region @xmath0 have been developed @xcite .",
    "however , in real systems the interaction is not confined to the central region but exists throughout the system .",
    "accounting for the interaction along the whole system is vital @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a complete description which generalizes the meir and wingreen formalism to systems where interactions exist throughout the system , as well as at the interfaces between the central region and the electrodes . since the choice of the location of these interfaces is purely arbitrary , and since the interactions exist everywhere , our approach is formally identical to a partition - free scheme @xcite .",
    "while keeping the approach of the original work of meir and wingreen @xcite , we derive the most general expression of the current for the fully interacting system . from this",
    ", we recover all previously derived transport expressions or corrections when introducing the appropriate level of approximation for the interaction .",
    "our formalism also leads to the generalization of the concept of embedding potentials when the interaction crosses at the boundaries .",
    "it therefore provides an alternative way of introducing open boundary conditions with interaction in finite - size systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : netransport ] , we provide the generalised current formula for fully interacting systems .",
    "we describe our model in section [ sec : model ] and derive the current expression in section [ sec : il ] , with full details of the calculations provided in appendix [ app : derivationil ] . the connections between more conventional results : the current at equilibrium , the current formula of meir and wingreen and others are given in sections [ sec : ilatequi ] to [ sec : ilwithdistribfnc ] . in section [ sec : sigmalc_hartree ] we describe how to apply our formalism in a specific case of interaction crossing at the contacts .",
    "finally , we conclude and discuss extension of our work in section [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "the system consists of two electrodes , left @xmath1 and right @xmath2 , which connect a central region @xmath0 via coupling matrix elements .",
    "the interaction , which we specifically leave undefined ( e.g. electron - electron or electron - phonon ) , is spread over the entire system and crosses at the interfaces between the @xmath3 and @xmath0 regions .",
    "we use different labels for the quantum states on each side of these interfaces : @xmath4 are used to represent the complete and orthogonal set of states for the @xmath5 and @xmath2 regions respectively .",
    "we also use a compact notation for the matrix elements @xmath6 of green s functions ( @xmath7 ) , the self - energies ( @xmath8 ) and coupling to the leads ( @xmath9 ) , where @xmath10 represents the matrix elements @xmath11 in the region @xmath0 , @xmath12 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 for @xmath15 , @xmath16 for @xmath17 , @xmath18 for @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "the complete derivation of the current expressions for the fully interacting lead - central region - lead junctions relies on only two assumptions : the many - body effects of the interacting particles are well described by self - energies @xmath24 in the one - particle green s functions @xmath25 , and there is no direct coupling or interaction between the states of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 regions : the only interaction between the leads is mediated by the region @xmath0 , there is no direct coupling i.e. @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "connected to the left @xmath1 and right @xmath2 electrodes , with respective quantum - state labels @xmath27 for the three @xmath28 subspaces .",
    "interactions are given by the coupling of the region @xmath0 to the @xmath3 electrode @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , and by the many - body effects @xmath24 within all regions as well as across the @xmath31 and @xmath32 interfaces .",
    "top : interfaces are arbitrarily placed at the contact between the scatterer ( a molecule ) and the leads . they can not be considered as being at equilibrium , being each in a region of strong spatial variation of the current and potential drop .",
    "bottom : interfaces are now well inside the @xmath33 regions ( @xmath0 region is now the so - called extended molecule ) , and are at local quasi - equilibrium . ]      the location of the interfaces @xmath31 and @xmath32 is arbitrary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ) , and chosen purely for mathematical convenience , as the interaction spreads throughout the system .",
    "we include such interfaces to make the connection between our results and other previously derived expressions within the partitioning scheme .    from the continuity equation @xmath34",
    ", we write the current through the interface between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 regions .",
    "the current flowing at the @xmath31 interface is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number of electrons in the @xmath1 region , and is related to the lesser green s function as @xmath37 . from the equations of motion @xcite obeyed by the green s functions on the keldysh time - loop contour @xmath38 , we obtain the current @xmath39 as @xmath40\\ ] ] from the rules of analytical continuation on @xmath38 ( see appendix [ app : analyticalcontinuation ] ) , we find that @xmath41 there are no lesser ( greater ) components for @xmath42 since its time dependence is local @xmath43 .    in the steady state ,",
    "all double - time quantities @xmath44 depend only on the time difference @xmath45 .",
    "the steady state current is given after fourier transform by using @xmath46 . to obtain the current , we need to calculate the following trace : @xmath47 = \\sum_{\\lambda , n,\\gamma }           v_{\\lambda n } g^<_{n \\lambda}(\\omega ) - g^<_{\\lambda n}(\\omega ) v_{n \\lambda }   \\\\ &    + \\sigma^{{{\\rm mb}},<}_{\\lambda \\gamma}(\\omega ) g^a_{\\gamma \\lambda}(\\omega )       + \\sigma^{{{\\rm mb}},r}_{\\lambda \\gamma}(\\omega ) g^<_{\\gamma \\lambda}(\\omega )   \\\\   &    -   g^<_{\\lambda \\gamma}(\\omega ) \\sigma^{{{\\rm mb}},a}_{\\gamma \\lambda}(\\omega )       -   g^r_{\\lambda \\gamma}(\\omega )",

    "we then need to evaluate the green s functions  matrix elements @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 by using the dyson equation @xmath53^x_{ij}$ ] ( with @xmath54 and @xmath55 the indices for the corresponding matrix elements ) and the rules of analytical continuation for the products ( see appendices [ app : analyticalcontinuation ] and [ app : derivationil ] for detail ) .",
    "we find the following general expression for the current @xmath39 flowing through the left interface : @xmath56 \\\\ + & { { \\rm tr}}_\\lambda\\left[\\sigma^{{{\\rm mb}},>}_{\\lambda\\lambda^\\prime }     g^<_{\\lambda^\\prime\\lambda } -     \\sigma^{{{\\rm mb}},<}_{\\lambda\\lambda^\\prime } g^>_{\\lambda^\\prime\\lambda } \\right ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 by definition @xmath58 , and similarly for the @xmath59 components .",
    "@xmath60 are the green s functions  of the region @xmath1 renormalised by the interaction _ inside _ that region : @xmath61 where all quantities are defined only in the subspace @xmath1 .",
    "there are two contributions to @xmath39 : the first trace is a generalisation of the meir and wingreen expression @xcite to the cases where the interactions exist within the three @xmath28 regions as well as in between the regions .",
    "the different quantities @xmath62 are related to the generalised embedding potentials ( i.e.  lead self - energies ) with interaction crossing at the @xmath31 and @xmath32 interfaces ( see end of appendix [ app : derivationil ] ) .",
    "the second trace in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ilfinal ] ) is related to inelastic effects involving a sum over the states of the @xmath1 region .",
    "although the @xmath1 region is semi - infinite by definition , an appropriate choice of the location of the @xmath31 interface reduces the summation . for a closed system at equilibrium ,",
    "the trace @xmath63 $ ] is zero simply because the system obeys the detailed balance equation : @xmath64 . for all other conditions ,",
    "if the @xmath31 interface is located deep enough in the @xmath1 electrode , the system is locally at quasi - equilibrium , and hence the trace vanishes ( see below ) .",

    "( [ eq : ilfinal ] ) can be obtained for the current @xmath65 flowing at the right _ cr _ interface by swapping the index @xmath1  @xmath66  @xmath2 and using the current conservation condition @xmath67 .",
    "finally we need to know , for practical calculations , the different green s functions  in all three regions .",
    "to evaluate the currents @xmath68 , we need the green s functions  @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "we finally get for @xmath87 : @xmath88 with @xmath89 . the rules of analytical continuation need to be applied to the products @xmath90 to get the full expansion of the generalised embedding potentials .",
    "one of the obvious checks to perform is that there is no net current at the @xmath31 and @xmath32 interfaces at equilibrium .",
    "considering the equation for @xmath39 given by eq.([eq : ilfinal ] ) , we have already shown that the trace @xmath91 $ ] vanishes at equilibrium because of the detailed balance principle .",
    "now we have to prove the same for the trace @xmath92 $ ] in eq.([eq : ilfinal ] ) . for this",
    "we use the procedure which consists of introducing non - equilibrium  distribution functions ( see section [ sec : ilwithdistribfnc ] below ) .",
    "since at equilibrium all distributions are equal to the fermi distribution @xmath93 , we end up , after long but trivial manipulation of eq.([eq : ilfinal ] ) , with @xmath94^{\\rm eq } =   { \\rm tr}_{n } \\left [   g^r_c \\sigma^r_{cl } \\left ( f^{\\rm eq } \\tilde{g}^r_l - \\tilde{g}^r_l f^{\\rm eq } \\right ) \\sigma^r_{lc } \\right .",

    "hence , as expected , the current @xmath39 from eq.([eq : ilfinal ] ) vanishes at equilibrium .      for systems where there are interactions only within @xmath0 , we have @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "then @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and eq .  (",
    "[ eq : ilfinal ] ) can be recast as @xmath100 , \\ ] ] with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "hence we recover the result of meir and wingreen @xcite .",
    "going one step further , we consider interaction within the @xmath1 and @xmath2 regions as well .",
    "the current @xmath39 in eq.([eq : ilfinal ] ) takes then the form of the meir and wingreen expression eq.([eq : il_meirwingreen ] ) , with renormalised escape rates @xmath103 , i.e.   @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the interactions within the leads renormalise the coupling at the contacts @xmath106 .",
    "note that we have allowed for a renormalised distribution function @xmath107 in the definition of @xmath108 .",
    "the distribution of the left lead @xmath107 has the same form as the fermi distribution function , but depending on the approximation chosen for the interaction @xmath109 , the corresponding fermi level may also need renormalization .",
    "we consider cases where the interaction is spread throughout the entire system , and are treated at the level of density - functional theory ( dft ) .",

    "to this potential corresponds an effective self - energy , local in both space and time @xcite .",
    "this forms a class of self - energies , where @xmath112 can not have lesser or greater components , since the times @xmath113 and @xmath114 must be on the same time - loop branch .",
    "with no lesser and greater components for @xmath115 , the trace @xmath116 $ ] in eq.([eq : ilfinal ] ) simply vanishes .",

    "the potential @xmath123 is spread throughout the system and inside the leads @xcite . hence eq .  ( [ eq : ilburke ] ) formally confirms the necessity of including the potential drop due to @xmath123 in the linear - response regime @xcite .",
    "one should note that our formalism includes all other cases with other kind of interactions ( electron - phonon ) confined only in the central region ) .",
    "it also includes other kind of electron - hole excitations which can be present in the leads @xcite ; and provides a way to treat systems with electron - hole excitations crossing at the contacts between the central region and the leads .",
    "we now discuss when the second trace in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ilfinal ] ) vanishes .",
    "we introduce the non - equilibrium  distributions @xmath125 obtained from the generalised kadanoff - baym ansatz @xcite @xmath126 for a green s function  or a self - energy  @xmath127 .",

    "furthermore , when the @xmath31 interface is located well inside the @xmath1 region , the states @xmath142 on the left side of the interface are at their local equilibrium .",

    "the current expression reduces then to @xmath145\\ ] ] which is just another way to express the @xmath146 $ ] in eq.([eq : ilfinal ] ) .",
    "we now give a brief description of how to implement our formalism for a specific case .",
    "we consider a single - molecule junction in the presence of electron - vibron interaction inside the central region and crossing at one of the contacts .",
    "we use the following hamiltonian for the central region @xmath147 where one electronic level @xmath148 and one vibration mode of energy @xmath149 are coupled together via the coupling constant @xmath150 .",
    "the central region is coupled to the non - interacting @xmath1 and @xmath2 regions via hopping integrals @xmath151 : @xmath152 we also consider that the hopping of an electron from the @xmath0 to the @xmath1 region ( and _ vice versa _ ) can excite another vibration mode of energy @xmath153 via the coupling constant @xmath154 : @xmath155 this model can be understood as a lowest - order expansion of the hopping integral @xmath156 between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 regions in terms of the relative position @xmath157 of the region @xmath0 with respect to the region @xmath1 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath158 represents in this model the interaction crossing at the @xmath31 interface .",
    "the corresponding non - equilibrium  green s functions  and self - energies  can be calculated at different orders of the interaction using conventional non - equilibrium  techniques @xcite .",
    "since there is no other interaction inside the @xmath1 and @xmath2 regions , the current expression is given by the first line of eq.([eq : ilfinal ] ) .",
    "we consider a mean - field approach to treat the crossing interaction .",
    "this model leads to the hartree - like expressions for the self - energies at the @xmath31 interface : @xmath159 ( similarly for @xmath160 ) .",
    "the closed expression for @xmath161 green s function  matrix elements are calculated from the corresponding dyson equations @xmath162^<_{lc}$ ] .",
    "there are no lesser and greater components for the self - energy @xmath163 at the mean - field level , as we have explained in section [ sec : ilatdftlevel ] .",
    "hence eq.([eq : upsilons ] ) reduces to @xmath164 with @xmath165 .",
    "one can see that the interaction crossing at the @xmath31 interface induces a static ( however bias - dependent ) renormalisation of the nominal coupling @xmath166 between the @xmath1 and @xmath0 regions .",
    "this non - equilibrium  renormalisation induces bias - dependent modifications of the broadening of the spectral features of the @xmath0 region .",
    "it can also lead to new physical non - equilibrium  effects in the current @xcite .",
    "the effects of the crossing interaction can also be treated beyond the mean - field level by considering a fock - like dynamical self - energy @xcite . in general the effects of other interaction ( electron - electron ) crossing at the @xmath31 and/or @xmath59 interfaces",
    "can be treated in a similar manner .",
    "we have derived a exact expression for the current through systems with interaction both within the @xmath28 regions and at the @xmath31 and @xmath32 interfaces .",
    "our result , eq.([eq : ilfinal ] ) , is general , assuming that there are no direct interactions between the leads ; a condition that is physically sound , especially for single - molecule junctions where the spatial gap between the two electrodes is large enough .",
    "the location of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 interfaces with respect to the physical realistic scatterer is arbitrary but , in practice , should be chosen conveniently for numerical calculations .",
    "when local quasi - equilibria are reached at the interfaces , a simpler expression for the current is obtained , since the local non - equilibrium distribution functions are equal to the corresponding fermi distributions .",

    "our formalism provides a formal justification of the concept of the extended molecule that is commonly used with the conventional partitioned scheme .",
    "it also provides the correction terms needed to deal with interaction crossing at the contacts and when the contacts are not in their respective local ( quasi ) equilibrium .    in practice",
    ", the calculations should be performed self - consistently since the various self - energies @xmath24 in the three regions and at the interfaces are functionals of the all green s functions  in all the system .",
    "this offers extra degrees of freedom to perform non - fully self - consistent calculations , and test different levels of approximations for the interaction .",
    "we have given an example of how such calculations can be performed for a specific case in section [ sec : sigmalc_hartree ] .",
    "we have also found that the current conservation conditions lead to an important result for a fully - interacting system : a condition that the many - body self - energies  @xmath170 should satisfying in order to keep the conservation @xmath67 ( see appendix [ app : currentconserv ] ) .    in a broader context",
    ", our formalism introduces in a formal manner the concept of generalised embedding potentials to interacting cases .",
    "embedding methods provide the correct boundary conditions for solving the schrdinger equation in a limited region of space , region i , automatically matching the solution on to the wavefunction in the rest of the system , region ii , via the use of the embedding potential @xcite . in the quantum transport community ,",

    "when the interactions cross the @xmath172 interfaces , we obtain a generalisation of the embedding potentials , defined as @xmath173 .",
    "these generalised embedding potentials contain a double non - locality , in the sense that the many - body part of @xmath174 has a spatial extent different from that of the coupling matrix elements @xmath175 .",
    "hence @xmath176 defines a buffer zone , contained between two surfaces whose separation is related to the characteristic spatial range of the interaction self - energy  @xmath177 .",
    "the generalised embedding potential provides a new alternative for introducing open boundary conditions with interaction within many - body finite size systems .    in summary",
    "therefore , we have introduced a new formalism for an accurate expression for the electron current in fully interacting systems .",
    "the expression is general and takes into account the fact that the interaction is crossing through the interface on which the current - density is integrated .",
    "numerical implementations of our formalism will enable us to study cases in which the long - range coulomb interaction is not sufficiently screened between the central region and the electrodes to be neglected or approximated , or cases in which vibration excitations at the contacts play an important role in the transport properties .",
