    "there is growing evidence that instantons play a very important role in qcd .",
    "the development of the interacting instanton liquid model @xcite allows one to calculate nonperturbatively to all orders in the  t hooft interaction , and results show that it correctly generates the quark condensate and most salient properties of light hadrons . as reviewed at this conference @xcite ,",
    "the essential features and parameters of this model have now been confirmed on the lattice , and there is strong lattice evidence that instantons and their associated zero modes play a significant role in hadron structure .    motivated by a provocative result by fuku - shima _ et _ _ al . _",
    "@xcite reporting a string tension in the instanton liquid model close to the phenomenological value , we have undertaken a careful calculation of the instanton induced heavy quark potential .",
    "the gauge field of a single instanton in @xmath6 in the singular gauge ( centered at the origin ) is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the  t hooft symbol .",
    "replacement of @xmath8 by @xmath9 yields the solution for an anti - instanton . the multi - instanton gauge configuration in the dilute instanton liquid model",
    "is generated by a linear superposition of the fields from a distribution of instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "each instanton and anti - instanton has a random center location and is embedded in @xmath10 with a random color orientation .",
    "we consider two distributions of the instanton size , @xmath1 , for @xmath10 : ( 1 ) a fixed size distribution , with @xmath11 ; and ( 2 ) a phenomenological distribution , with @xmath12 at small @xmath1 as expected from the dilute instanton gas approximation and @xmath13 at large @xmath1 as would occur if the perturbative running of the coupling constant @xmath14 were frozen at sufficiently large @xmath1 .",
    "we use the parameterization by shuryak@xcite for this variable size distribution , @xmath15 we choose @xmath16 so that the average instanton size @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a normalization constant .",

    "wilson loops @xmath22\\ ] ] are measured in a @xmath23 rectangle in the central @xmath24 plane .",
    "this leaves a distance of at least @xmath25 or more than 10 times the average instanton size @xmath26 from the measured wilson loop to the 4-@xmath27 boundary so that the edge effects from the open boundary are small .",
    "the largest wilson loop is @xmath28 in size .",
    "the discretization @xmath29 in the path ordered integral is @xmath30 , which is about @xmath31 of the average instanton size .",
    "we study three different instanton number densities , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 for both fixed and variable instanton size distributions .",
    "the number of gauge configurations studied for each different @xmath35 is 1600 , 8000 and 1600 , respectively .",
    "the fundamental difficulty in this calculation is measuring with adequate statistical accuracy the large wilson loops required to determine the potential at large distances .",
    "we determine the heavy quark potential @xmath2 from rectangular loops of different time extent as follows : @xmath36 to obtain the most accurate measurement of the potential , we plot @xmath37 vs.  t and find the plateau corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "figures [ fig : fixeff ] and [ fig : vareff ] show such plots at different @xmath3 for both fixed and variable instanton size distributions at an instanton number density @xmath38 . for the fixed instanton size distribution , @xmath39 , plateaus for @xmath37 set in at about @xmath40 .",
    "we have good plateaus for all @xmath41 at @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast , for the variable instanton size distribution , not only do the plateaus set in at a larger @xmath43 , but also the statistical fluctuations are much larger at large @xmath3 , especially for @xmath44 .",
    "it is clear that this behavior of the variable size distribution arises from large instantons in the tail of the distribution . even with an ensemble as large as 8000 configurations , we are only able to obtain a potential @xmath2 for @xmath45 at @xmath46",
    ".    =    figures [ fig : potfix ] and [ fig : potvar ] show the heavy quark potential out to the maximum distance we can reliably measure .",
    "the salient results are the following . at short distance",
    ", the slope is identical for both the fixed and the variable size distributions at a given @xmath35 and is proportional to @xmath35 . at the value @xmath42 of the instanton liquid model",
    ", this slope is @xmath47 0.1 @xmath48 , corresponding to 1/10 of the physical string tension .",
    "we note that by scaling , the physical string tension would be obtained at @xmath42 by increasing the mean value of @xmath1 by @xmath49 to 0.59@xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath3 is much greater than the largest instantons in the medium , we expect @xmath2 to approach a constant @xcite . for the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : size ] ) , however , it is interesting that the potential is essentially linear in the region of @xmath50  @xmath51 . hence , even though the random instanton liquid is not strictly confining , in the region of physical interest for hadron structure , it has a significant linear component .",
