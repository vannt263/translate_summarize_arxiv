    "the hubbard model is one of the basic models in the theory of strongly correlated systems . during its",
    "forty years of lifetime numerous approaches have been proposed for the investigation of the possible states of the system , the spectrum of its quasi - particles and the collective modes , the transport properties , the different types of ordered states and the phase transitions among them .",
    "such long period of development of a model which could look simple at a first glance  since it contains only two parameters , the bare bandwidth @xmath6 and the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath1  is determined by the circumstance that the case @xmath9 is of main physical significance .",
    "but just in this case the theory does not contain a small parameter .",
    "already the first researchers tried to avoid perturbative theories and used different non - perturbative approaches .",
    "starting from the pioneering works of hubbard @xcite @xcite @xcite , the method of decoupling of the double - time green s functions ( gf ) was treated successfully .",
    "the works based on projecting the equations of motion for the basic operators come here @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the most productive application of this approach has been done with the method of composite operators @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite used widely not only for the hubbard model but also for many other models @xcite of strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "the method of the spectral density moments uses in essence the cut short of the equations of motions for the basic operators as well @xcite @xcite .",
    "also the variational method of gutzwiller belongs to the non - perturbative approaches @xcite , and made it possible to investigate qualitatively the behavior of a vast class of strongly correlated systems during the last four decades .",
    "the method of slave particles ( slave bosons ) represents an important direction of investigation also @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the basic operators are expressed through a product of conventional fermi and bose operators with subsequent exclusion of unphysical states .",
    "the suitable choice of a slave particle representation makes it possible to catch the physics of low energy states in the scope of the mean field approximation .",
    "unfortunately there is no standard recipe for constructing such representations , and it is not always clear which one among the possible representations is the most adequate .    during the last decade",
    "the method of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) has become quite popular @xcite@xcite . by means of this method",
    "it has been possible to investigate the behavior of almost all the models in the theory of strongly correlated systems in the region of strong and intermediate interactions .",
    "apparently dmft is the most efficient method of investigation of these systems , although not exempt from some defects : it demands a huge amount of computations and has problems with the description of collective modes ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "we do not mention here the numerical methods like quantum monte carlo and small cluster diagonalization , because we concentrate our efforts on the analytical approaches .",
    "we want to pay attention to one of the analytical approaches where there is a possibility to derive a consistent perturbative theory with respect to the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "definitely , such an approach corresponds to the perturbative theory near the atomic limit .",
    "the approach is based on the introduction of a generating functional @xmath10 $ ] , describing the interaction of the system with fluctuating fields depending on space and time .",
    "this functional corresponds to the generalization of the partition function of the system for the case of interactions with external fluctuating fields . for a proper choice of the @xmath11 operator the different gfs of the system",
    "are expressed through variational derivatives with respect to fluctuating fields .    at the beginning",
    "this method was developed for a weak interaction by kadanoff and baym @xcite@xcite forty years ago .",
    "it could be generalized to a strongly correlated system when we express the hamiltonian through some basic operators taking into account the correlations ( for instance the hubbard @xmath0 operators)[3 ] instead of the conventional ones .",
    "the first time such an approach has been applied to the hubbard model was in the limit @xmath12 ( with an additional small parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the degeneracy of the electronic states ) @xcite . afterwards",
    "this approach has been developed farther in the works @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "recently we have provided a general framework for the generating functional approach ( gfa ) and we have applied it to a set of basic models of spin and strongly correlated electronic systems : heisenberg model , hubbard model for @xmath15 , @xmath16-model , @xmath17-model , double exchange model @xcite@xcite .",
    "the results of these investigations have been generalized in the monograph @xcite , published in russian , and in the course of lectures delivered in an international school @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply the gfa to the hubbard model with a finite coulomb interaction @xmath1 . supposing that @xmath1 is large but of the order of @xmath6 we express the hamiltonian of the model in terms of the @xmath0 operators and calculate the electronic and bosonic gfs .",
    "the latter describes the two types of collective modes : magnons and doublons .",
    "the electronic gf is a matrix with respect to the spin index @xmath18 , the index @xmath19 , indicating the hubbard subbands , and the index @xmath20 corresponding to the particle - hole representation .",
    "we have derived the equation in the variational derivatives with respect to fluctuating fields for it . because the basic operators do not commute on @xmath21-values , the electronic green s function is characterized by two functions of four - momenta : the self - energy @xmath3 and the terminal part @xmath4 . for @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "the equations with the variational derivatives have been derived too , whereas it is possible to make iterations with respect to the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "just these iterative series represent the perturbative theory near the atomic limit @xcite .",
    "we have limited ourselves to the first and second order corrections for @xmath3 and extracted from them a mean field type @xmath22 part , which includes contributions depending only on the wave vector @xmath23 , but not on the frequency .",
    "@xmath22 consists of a term giving a shift to the hubbard subbands and renormalizing its width .",
    "the last term was extracted from the second order correction @xmath24 , which is an  uncutable \" term ( with respect to the hopping matrix element ) , while a  cutable \" term @xmath25 describes the dynamical interaction with boson - type excitations .",
    "a procedure of extraction of the static part from @xmath24 was borrowed from the composite operator method ( com ) @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the main idea of this approach is that bosonic correlators , describing for example static fluctuations of charge , spin and pair , should not be calculated by some uncontrollable approximation ( like decoupling or use of the equation of motion ) , but must be determined by means of general properties of the electronic gf [ 10 ] .",
    "the gfa , restricted to the mean field approximation , and the com , restricted to a two - pole approximation , have a different structure for the electronic gf . in spite of this , the results obtained by these two methods for different properties of the hubbard model turned out to be in very good agreement .",
    "in particular , such mean field gfs give two quasiparticle subbands with a gap between them , which vanishes for half - filling at some critical value @xmath26 , and an insulator - metal phase transition occurs .",
    "detailed comparison of the mean field approximation in gfa and com will be discussed below .    using the electron gfs we found , we can calculate bose - like gfs for plasmons , magnons and doublons . in this paper",
    "we study only doublons  collective modes , describing motion of double occupied states of the lattice sites .",
    "the equation for the doublon gf has been derived .",
    "this equation contains variational derivatives of the electronic gf with respect to the corresponding fluctuating fields , coupled with charge densities . in the mean field approximation for the electronic @xmath3 we have obtained the closed equation for the doublon gf . for the paramagnetic state at half filling ( @xmath7 )",
    "the doublon gf has a soft mode at momentum @xmath27 .",
    "it indicates a possible instability of the uniform state against a charge density wave formation . when the filling deviates from unity ( @xmath28 ) , the pole of the doublon gf has a gap @xmath29 , thus having the activative character .",
    "the content of the paper is the following . in part 2 ,",
    "based on the @xmath0 operators formalism , the gfa is constructed . in part 3",
    "it is derived the equation of motion for the electronic gf in the form of equation with variational derivatives .",
    "this equation is decoupled into two : one for the self energy and one for the terminal part . in part 4",
    "the iterations of these equations with respect to the parameter @xmath5 are implemented and the gf in the  hartree - fock approximation \" is calculated . in part 5",
    "we formulate a mean field approximation and compare gfa and com approaches .",
    "a bose - like gf for doublons is calculated in part 6 with the electronic gf taken in the mean field approximation . in part 7",
    "we calculate the doublon susceptibility in the hydrodynamical regime .",
    "finally in part 8 we discuss the obtained results and propose suggestions for further study of the hubbard model .",
    "let us consider the conventional hubbard model for nondegenerate states . in terms of the fermi operators",
    "the model hamiltonian is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the operator of annihilation ( creation ) of an electron on the site @xmath32 with spin @xmath18 , @xmath33 is the electron number on the same site with the given spin . under the condition of a strong on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is the hopping matrix element for the nearest neighbors and @xmath36 is the coordination number ) it is useful to express the hamiltonian ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) in terms of the @xmath0 operators . the operator @xmath37 for the site @xmath32 describes the transitions between the four possible states @xmath38  without any electron , with one electron possessing the spin projection @xmath18 or @xmath39 and a pair of electrons , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 operators could be represented through the conventional fermi operators by means of the relations @xmath40 the operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 describe the correlated creation of an electron and are fermi - like @xmath43-operators ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 describe the flip of a spin on a site and the creation of a pair ; they are bose - like @xmath46-operators , respectively .",
    "the remaining @xmath0 s are called diagonal .",
    "we note that there are the hermitian - conjugate operators @xmath47 .",
    "the sixteen @xmath0 operators comprise thus the whole set , forming the algebra with the corresponding property of the product @xmath48 and the permutation relations of the anticommuting type for the @xmath43-operators while commutating for the @xmath46-operators .",
    "we note that the conventional fermi operators are expressed through the linear combinations of the @xmath0 operators of the @xmath43-type @xmath49 these relations express the motion of the correlated electrons in the two hubbard subbands .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the two - component spinors for the the @xmath43-operators : @xmath50 then the hamiltonian ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) is represented as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 @xmath53 here we added to hamiltonian ( 2.1 ) the term @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the chemical potential and @xmath56 is the external magnetic field , that is why new notation appears : @xmath57 . in the quadratic form ( [ eq:2.7 ] ) @xmath58 represents the component of the spinor @xmath59 ; in addition we have introduced the matrix @xmath60 note that the index @xmath19 numerates the hubbard subbands . with the help of the rule of multiplication ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) for @xmath0 operators ,",
    "one can write the permutation relations of the spinor @xmath43-operators : @xmath61_{+}=",
    "\\delta_{ij}f_{i}^{\\sigma}\\\\ & \\left [ \\varpsi(i\\sigma)\\otimes\\varpsi^{\\dag}(j\\bar{\\sigma } ) \\right]_{+}= \\delta_{ij}x_{i}^{\\bar{\\sigma}\\sigma}\\tau^{z}\\\\ & \\left [ \\varpsi(i\\sigma)\\otimes\\varpsi(j\\bar{\\sigma } ) \\right]_{+}= \\delta_{ij}\\sigma x_{i}^{02}(i \\tau^{y } ) \\end{split } \\right\\ } , \\label{eq:2.9}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath63 is a @xmath64 matrix , composed of @xmath0 operators : @xmath65    the permutation relations between @xmath43- and @xmath46-operators have a commutator character : @xmath66_{-}= \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{\\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{2 } } \\varpsi(i\\bar{\\sigma_{1}})\\\\ & \\left [ \\varpsi(i\\sigma_{1}),x_{j}^{20 } \\right]_{-}= \\delta_{ij}\\bar{\\sigma}_{1 } \\varpsi^{\\dag}(i\\bar{\\sigma}_{1})\\tau^{x}\\\\ \\end{split } \\right\\}. \\label{eq:2.11}\\ ] ] in other cases of permutations , relations of type ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.11 ] ) give zero .",
    "thus , an anticommutator of two @xmath67-operators is expressed either through a diagonal or a @xmath46-operator , but the commutator of @xmath67- and @xmath46-operators is naturally a @xmath67-operator .",
    "note the two relations @xmath68 @xmath69 which complete the algebra of the @xmath0 operators .",
    "let us write the equation of motion for the @xmath43-operator . for the thermodynamical time @xmath70 we start from the heisenberg equation @xmath71\\,,\\ ] ] which could be written in the case of the hamiltonian ( [ eq:2.6 ] )  ( [ eq:2.7 ] ) in the following form @xmath72 here a double - row matrix with respect to the spinor index was introduced @xmath73    here and in the following",
    "the numerical indexes indicate the four - dimensional coordinates including the site and the time @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath75 ; a summation over the primed indexes is understood ( it is a summation over the sites @xmath32 and an integration over the time @xmath74 ) . and",
    "finally the value @xmath76 has been introduced , representing the matrix over the spinor indexes ( the last circumstance has been specified by the symbol @xmath77 ) .",
    "thus the operator @xmath78 represents the linear combination of the @xmath43-operators , with the bosonic @xmath46-operators as the coefficients , and the matrixes @xmath79 and @xmath80 too .    following the method we have applied many times to different quantum models @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , we introduce the generating functional @xmath81=\\text{tr}\\left(\\mathrm{e}^{-\\beta \\mathcal{h}}t\\mathrm{e}^{-v}\\right ) \\equiv\\mathrm{e}^{\\phi } , \\label{eq:2.13}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the symbol of the chronological product and the trace",

    "thus , differentiating the equation @xmath10 $ ] with respect to the different @xmath84 s , we can express the different gfs through the variational derivatives with respect to the corresponding fields .",
    "for instance , for the single particle bose - like gfs of the plasmons , magnons and the doublons we have the expressions : @xmath85}\\frac{\\displaystyle\\delta^{2}z[v ] } { \\displaystyle\\delta v_{1}^{\\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{1 } } \\delta v_{2}^{\\sigma_{2}\\sigma_{2 } } } , \\label{eq:2.20}\\ ] ] @xmath86 @xmath87 here and further symbol @xmath88 , where @xmath89 means averading over gibbs ansamble with hamiltonian @xmath90 .",
